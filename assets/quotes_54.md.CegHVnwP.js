En route, she spent 10 days at Balboa, Canal Zone, for turbine repairs and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 April. Between 4 May and 15 August, she made five round trips between the west coast and Hawaii with passengers and cargo. On 1 September she sailed from Pearl Harbor with occupation troops for Japan, arriving at Sasebo on 22 September. She then made one voyage to Manila; returned to Sasebo; and reported for \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" duty on 20 October. After making two voyages returning troops home from the Philippines, the ship was released from \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty in December 1945 and arrived at San Diego for inactivation on 8 February 1946. Saugus was decommissioned on 24 March 1947 but remained \\"in service, in reserve\\" until 17 October 1947. Her designation was changed to MCS-4 on 18 October 1956. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1961 and transferred to the Maritime Administration's reserve fleet at Suisun Bay, California on 1 October 1962.

It concerns three generations of Armenian American women living in Memorial, Connecticut during the twentieth century. Rather than focus on a central character, the book contains the story of three generations: the grandmother Casard, her daughter Araxie, and granddaughter, Seta. The struggles faced by each woman show the enduring effects of the Armenian genocide which occurred in 1915 at the hands of the Young Turks. A major theme in both Edgarian's work and Armenian-American literature is the ability to reconcile the genocide, lost identity, and displacement of the past to life in present-day America. In Rise the Euphrates, this reconciliation is symbolized in the recovering of Casard's lost name, Garod.  Plot summary  Rise the Euphrates begins with Casard's story. At the time of the genocide, Casard is ten and still goes by her original Armenian name Garod. In Armenian, “Garod” means yearning which is what Casard does the rest of her life: yearn for an Armenia which no longer exists. Casard's mother's name is Seta, the same name given to Casard's granddaughter. The Turks invaded Garod's town of Harput, murdering the men and raping many women and girls. Among those to escape rape and death, Garod and her mother Seta are driven out of town into the desert. After walking for two weeks without water or food, the caravan reaches the Euphrates River. The river lies in front of the caravan, and a band of murdering Turks emerges from behind, forcing a choice; death by drowning or death by Turkish sword. Seta takes Garod's hand and prepares to jump into the Euphrates. At the last second, Garod remains on the bank and watches her mother drown. Turning around, Garod sees the band of Turks departing. Garod then wanders in the desert for several days, forgetting her name in the process. Later, under the care of nuns, Garod is given the name Cafard, which is a French word meaning melancholy of the soul. She eventually emigrates to the United States. At Ellis Island, immigration officials hear her name as Casard. While at Ellis Island, Casard meets, and after an afternoon of courtship, marries her husband Vrej; another exiled Armenian. Casard and Vrej had one daughter, Araxie. Araxie grows up and marries an odar, a non Armenian husband, named George Loon. George and Araxie have three children, Van, Seta, and Melanie. When Seta is born, Casard takes Seta into her arms and whispers her story of the genocide. Casard then tells Seta that her task is to recover Casard's forgotten name. Araxie was also given the task to find Casard's name. However, one generation removed from the genocide has left Araxie near Casard's pain to achieve the type of reconciliation Seta is capable of. Seta's younger years are marked with the tensions occurring between her mother and grandmother. Casard dies unexpectedly when Seta is twelve from a fatal car crash. Similar to the Armenian genocide, the Loon family life after Casard's death is never the same once Casard is gone. The remainder of the book highlights Seta's growing up years. However, with Casard's passing, Seta's life becomes more American and less Armenian-American. Araxie finds herself without a final opportunity to reconcile with her mother and becomes depressed. Later she divorces George Loon. Without Casard, the family structure and its place in the Armenian- American community disintegrates. Despite this, Seta remembers Casard's hidden story and the desire that her lost name be recovered. This recovery is achieved through another Armenian-American girl, Theresa Van. Several years later, Seta betrays Theresa with a lie in order to secure her own popularity. After this betrayal, the girls do not interact for several years. Shortly after Seta and Theresa turn 15, Theresa's mother dies. A few weeks after her mother's death, Theresa is abducted and severely beaten by a well known member of the town. While Theresa is recuperating, Seta brings offerings of sorts to Theresa's house. Her interaction with Theresa and the offerings she brings draw Seta back into the Armenian community. At the end of the book, Seta and Theresa play the duduk together. That night after playing the duduk with Theresa, and wholly embracing her Armenian heritage, Seta dreams of the women who were at the Euphrates River the day Casard forgot her name. The women tell the story of what Casard was only able to verbalize as “the indignities”. When she wakes up from her dream, Seta has recovered Casard's name, Garod, which she then relays to Araxie.  Major themes  Matrilineal approach – In Rise the Euphrates, the main characters are all women. Seta discovers her Armenian heritage by interacting with her mother and grandmother. In other words, the book is concerned with a matrilineal approach. Commonly found in Armenian-American literature is what is known as a patrilineal approach. This means the main characters are typically male. The characters discover their Armenian heritage through interactions with fathers and grandfathers rather than mothers and grandmothers. Common to the patrilineal approach is the idea of discovering the Armenian homeland. In the matrilineal approach, discovering identity is highlighted. Each of these, discovering the Armenian homeland and discovering sources of identity, are ways to reconcile- comes to terms with – the Armenian Genocide. Oral storytelling – For hundreds of years in Armenia, Armenians maintained their sense of identity through the Armenian language and the Armenian Apostolic Church. In the United States this did not change. For Armenians living in the United States, much of Armenian culture is still kept alive through language and religion. Because of the importance of language to the culture, stories and oral story telling are very important. In Rise the Euphrates, the stories themselves are an integral part of the book. The emphasis in the book is on Casard's story; however, through the other stories Edgarian includes, the reader will further understand Armenian culture and the tradition of storytelling. Betrayal myth – A central myth in Carol Edgarian's Rise the Euphrates is the betrayal myth. Edgarian names several betrayal myths in her book, among them, the biblical stories of Cain and Abel, and Judas and Christ. Awards and nominations 1994 ANC Freedom Award.

Arlen, son of writer Michael Arlen, becomes curious about his Armenian past, and so undertakes a journey with his wife to Armenia in 1975. His book is both an account of his travels in Armenia, and a cultural and historical background of the country. Similar to Edgarian, Arlen is concerned with reconciliation between the past and present. Peter Balakian, Black Dog of Fate : A Memoir. 1st ed. New York: Basic Books, 1997. In Armenian American literature, this book is the masculine counterpart to Edgarian's Rise the Euphrates. Like Edgarian's main character Seta, Balakian's main character is a second- generation Armenian American who must come to terms with the Armenian Genocide passed down to him by his grandmother. Both books aim to reconcile the Armenian past with the American present. In both books, the bridge between the past and present is the grandmother's retelling of the past.

An officer with the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) task force, Pérez was involved in numerous crimes and corruption, notably the shooting and framing of Javier Ovando, in addition to the theft and resale of at least $800,000 of cocaine from LAPD evidence lockers. Pérez is accused of being a member of the Bloods, a notorious Los Angeles gang, and murdering rapper The Notorious B.I.G. at the behest of producer Suge Knight of Death Row Records. When Pérez was finally arrested, he implicated 70 other Rampart Division officers in various forms of misconduct, ranging from bad shootings to consuming alcohol while on duty. Over 100 convictions were overturned based on Pérez's testimony. Private life Pérez was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico in 1967 and moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1972; some months later he moved to Paterson, New Jersey, and then he would eventually move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1982. Pérez graduated from high school in 1985 and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was hired by the LAPD after leaving the military in 1989. Prior to this, he had been a reject and passed over for hiring by background investigators from several other departments in Southern California. He also looked and acted in a \\"gang like\\" manner. He married Lorri Charles in August 9, 1985. In 1988 they moved to Los Angeles. The couple split up in 1989 after Lorri discovered that Pérez cheated on her with another marine. He lived alone in 1992 in Chino Hills. The two officially divorced in 1993 when he married his second wife, LAPD dispatcher Denise Aubry. In 1998 the two settled in Los Angeles. Career After serving on routine patrol duties, Pérez was transferred to a narcotics unit in 1992. In 1995 he was transferred to Rampart Division and assigned to CRASH, an anti-gang unit given a long leash by the LAPD. Pérez gained a reputation as a tough and effective officer, valued for his fluency in Spanish and his knowledge of L.A.'s gangs. Criminal activities On October 12, 1996, Pérez and his partner Nino Durden shot and framed an unarmed gang member Javier Ovando. Ovando, who was left paralyzed, was sentenced to 23 years in prison based on the officers' false testimony. On August 25, 1998, Pérez, then age 31 and a nine-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, was arrested for stealing of cocaine from a department property room. (The theft was originally suspected to be an attempt at framing fellow officer Frank Lyga in retaliation for the shooting of Pérez's friend, Kevin Gaines.) The cocaine was estimated to be worth $800,000 on the street. His December 1998 trial ended as a mistrial. To avoid a second trial and the possible conviction of his second wife, who according to authorities may have known about Pérez's illegal activities, on September 8, 1999 he cut a plea bargain with authorities. In his plea bargain he revealed the Rampart scandal in exchange for immunity for his misconduct. On November 6, 1997, fellow CRASH officer David Mack and two accomplices stole $722,000 during a robbery at a Bank of America branch near the University of Southern California campus. According to the Tupac documentary Assassination: Battle for Compton, citing official legal documents, a reliable jail informant by the name of Ken Boagni, who befriended Rafael Pérez in prison, stated Pérez claimed the money stolen in the bank robbery was intended to go to Harry Billups, also known as Amir Muhammed, who was friends with Mack, for allegedly carrying out the murder of rapper Christopher Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls. Billups had not been paid in full by his contractors, namely Reggie Wright Jr. and David Kenner, because he failed to also murder Sean Combs, the second intended target. Boagni claimed both Pérez and Mack were involved in the murder of Wallace, but Billups was the shooter. Criminal charges February 2000 In February 2000, Pérez was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing 8 pounds of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker. At his sentencing, Pérez read a statement in which he said, \\"I cheated on my wife. I cheated on my employer, and I cheated on all of you, the people of Los Angeles\\". July 24, 2001 release On July 24, 2001, due to his plea bargain Pérez was released from prison and placed on parole. December 17, 2001 – Federal charges Pérez pled guilty to new charges resulting from the shooting of Javier Ovando. He was charged with 2 felony counts; (1) conspiracy to violate Ovando's civil rights; (2) Possessing a firearm with an eliminated serial number, the firearm was used as evidence to frame Ovando. He was sentenced on May 6, 2002 to serve two years in federal prison. He was released on June 2004. October 31, 2006 felony count On October 31, 2006, Pérez pleaded no contest to a felony count of perjury before the Torrance Superior Court. Pérez, who legally changed his name to Ray Lopez, was arrested in July by Department of Motor Vehicles investigators while visiting his federal parole officer in Inglewood. Pérez pleaded no contest to lying on his application for a California driver's license on June 30, 2005. Pérez was sentenced to an additional three years' probation and 300 hours of community service. After his release from prison he settled with his family in Inglewood. Then in 2006 he had a second divorce from Denise. He then moved and lived in many cities like Redondo Beach and San Diego and had a series of different jobs. He currently lives in Chino Hills and, as of May 2015, is reported to work as a limo driver. He was seen driving for producer Harvey Weinstein.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_DjlcX1mh0 Questions of credibility The credibility of Pérez has been undermined by his testimony in several internal affairs investigations in which three officers, including Brian Liddy, accused of crimes or misconduct were found not guilty or the charges were dropped. He has failed several lie-detector tests and has made several errors in his testimony in the past. The issue of Pérez's credibility has already led to at least 5 cases of either dropped charges or acquittal. Murder of The Notorious B.I.G. allegations In March, 1997, influential rapper Christopher Wallace, who was known as The Notorious B.I.G., was murdered in a Los Angeles drive-by shooting. On April 16, 2007, Wallace's relatives filed a wrongful death suit against the city of Los Angeles, former LAPD officer Rafael Pérez and his partner former Officer Nino Durden, seeking unspecified general, compensatory and punitive monetary damages. The lawsuit was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court by Wallace's mother, his widow Faith Evans, and his two children. The lawsuit states that Pérez, Nino Durden, their partner former officer David Mack, and \\"certain unknown persons\\" were responsible for the death of Christopher Wallace. The rapper was shot to death on March 9, 1997, as he and Sean Combs left the 11th Annual Soul Train Music Awards after-party held at the Petersen Automotive Museum on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The lawsuit states the killing was committed \\"in a very efficient, organized and professional manner, suggesting that a high degree of coordination and planning preceded his murder.\\" The suit further alleges that Pérez admitted to the LAPD that he and David Mack \\"conspired to murder, and participated in the murder of Christopher Wallace.\\"Estate of Wallace v. City of Los Angeles, 229 F.R.D. 163 (C.D. Cal. 2005);Reid, Shaheem (July 5, 2005). \\"Notorious B.I.G. Wrongful-Death Case Declared A Mistrial\\". MTV News. Retrieved February 14, 2007. It was alleged that Pérez was on duty during the night of March 9, 1997 but there was no evidence of that allegation. Christopher Wallace's murder is believed to have been in retaliation for the murder of Tupac Shakur. Tupac Shakur was a member of Death Row Records, run by Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight. Knight is known to have hired off-duty Rampart cops for security such as Kevin Gaines, who was shot to death by fellow LAPD officer Frank Lyga on March 18, 1997. Knight, who grew up in Compton, is well known for his ties to the Bloods. Following his arrest, detectives found several photos of Rafael Pérez flashing Blood gang signs. The connection between Pérez and the murder of Christopher Wallace has long been a source of speculation by the LAPD. The current wrongful death lawsuit states that Pérez was a member of \\"a violent street gang associated with Death Row Records, and that he was partly responsible for Wallace's death.\\" In popular culture *In the 2001 film Training Day, Denzel Washington said he emulated the style of Rafael Pérez to give authenticity to his portrayal of corrupt LAPD cop Alonzo Harris. The character's vehicle has the license plate ORP 967, which is said to stand for Officer Rafael Pérez, born in 1967. *The television series The Shield is based on the Los Angeles Rampart scandal, and the show's main character, Officer Vic Mackey, is based loosely on Rafael Pérez. * The TV series Mugshots a crime documentary show from Court TV (now TruTV) released Rafael Perez - LAPD's Notorious Cop that showcased Pérez's criminal actions. * Pérez is portrayed by Neil Brown Jr. in the 2018 film City of Lies, based on the Rampart scandal and the CRASH officers alleged involvement in the murder of Biggie Smalls.

Descended from the old German breed, the Stoeberer (lit. \\"rummager\\"), which became popular with commoners following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, who required a versatile hunting dog. Stoeberer is now a type of hunting dog in Germany with the Wachtelhund being its sole member. The breed is not very well known outside of Germany, but was recognised by the United Kennel Club in 1996. A well built breed, its coat comes in brown shades with occasional white markings. It can be trained to retrieve game, as well as for tracking. It is related to the Small Münsterländer (″Heidewachtel″) and the Drentse Patrijshond, all of which are descendants from the quail dog that at least date back to the 15th century. History A German Spaniel photographed in 1915. Frederick Roberth, a German dog breeder, is credited with creating the modern Deutscher Wachtelhund around 1890. While several breeds feature in its makeup, the most prominent dog breed to be bred into the modern breed is the now extinct Stoeberer. The Stoeberer has been mentioned in literature as far back as 1719, and was thought to have a nose as powerful as a Bloodhound. Following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the common man in the German states was allowed to hunt and needed a versatile hunting dog; that dog was the Stoeberer. In the late 19th century, when Roberth was working on his new breed, he found specimens of the Stoeberer in Bavaria, and those dogs were crossed with water dogs and sporting spaniels to become the modern German Spaniel. In 1903, the Deutscher Wachtelhund was recognised as a breed and, following that, the German breed club, the Verein fur Deutsche Wachtelhund (VDW), was organised. The term Stoeberer has since become a category of hunting dog in Germany, with the Wachtelhund being the sole member of that category. In 1910, the VDW selected four male dogs and seven female dogs upon which to base the breed standard for the Wachtelhund. Those dogs were selected from all over Germany, one coming from each region, with two coming from Hannover. All of the modern registered German Spaniels today are descended from those eleven dogs. A modern German Spaniel John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain owned a German Spaniel named Pincher, thought to be his favourite dog, which was painted by Edwin Henry Landseer. The dog originally belonged to his son William Henry, but became his constant companion. Lord Eldon would write of Pincher's behaviour in correspondence, for example to Lady F. J. Bankes in December 1831: \\"When I got to Southampton, Pincher, who sends his kindest regards, marched up to the bed-room, in which I slept the last two times I was there. The chambermaid provided another room for me, the house being full of company, there being a ball at Southampton. Pincher was uneasy at this, and out of humour, and if he could speak, he would not have allowed it.\\" Following Lord Eldon' death, a sum was left to his daughter, Lady Frances, specifically to pay for the care of the dog. Not usually kept as pets, the dogs are often owned by German foresters and professional hunters. In the 1960s and 70s, several German Spaniels were imported into the United States, and descendants of those dogs are now used in Canada to track down and flush out American black bear. A further pair of dogs was brought to the United States in 1994, and the United Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1996, placing it in the Gun dog group. There is thought to be about 100 German Spaniels in North America. Description A three-month-old puppy, showing the variation in the shades of color in the breed The Deutscher Wachtelhund is a strong boned, muscular, medium-sized gundog with long thick wavy hair. It is solidly-built which allows it to retrieve heavy game such as hares and foxes. The ears are fairly long and should reach from half way to the nose, to the tip of the nose. The size is approximately at the withers. Body length, from the nose to the base of the tail is twice the length of the dogs height. Average weight for both males and females of the breed is between . Its life expectancy is 12 to 14 years. The coat is short and fine on the head, and long on the body, where it is strong, thick, wavy or curly, with enough undercoat to provide protection. It has a well feathered coat which is usually either brown or brown roan. Although brown, it can have white markings chest and/or legs, and may have white ticking anywhere on its body. Other colors that the coat can come in include red and white, and solid red. Plain black coats do not occur in the breed. Temperament The Deutscher Wachtelhund is a versatile gun dog. They are lively with a very strong hunting instinct and have a friendly attitude towards humans and other dogs. The Wachtelhund is quick to learn and adapt to new situations and has a great deal of courage. While not able to match the abilities of more specialized spaniels and retrievers they are able to hunt upland game, retrieve, track and blood trail large game successfully, making them popular among hunters who need a dog able to fulfil many roles adequately. Outside Germany This breed has gained numbers in Sweden along with the increase of the wild boar population in the south of the country, as well as the creation of crossbreeds with native spitzhounds to produce tough and brave dogs that will both give chase and \\"stop\\" or \\"stand down\\" the boar giving the hunter the chance to sneak in to kill the prey. They will also give a death bark or take down wounded game if trained to.

Additionally, Muslims also honor David for having received the divine revelation of the Psalms.See Quran 4:163; 17:55 Mentioned sixteen times in the Quran, David appears in the Islamic scripture as a link in the chain of prophets who preceded Muhammad.4:163; 6:84 Although he is not usually considered one of the \\"law-giving\\" prophets (ulū al-ʿazm), \\"he is far from a marginal figure\\" in Islamic thought. In later Islamic traditions, he is praised for his rigor in prayer and fasting. He is also presented as the prototypical just ruler and as a symbol of God's authority on earth, having been at once a king and a prophet. David is particularly important to the religious architecture of Islamic Jerusalem.  Name  The Quranic Arabic form of David is Dāwud or Dāwūd, differing from Koine and (which follow ). These forms appear in the Quran sixteen times.  Narrative in the Quran  David's narrative in the Quran, in many respects, parallels that given in the Bible. He is named a prophet (nabī) and also a messenger (rasūl), David is included in lists of those who received revelation (waḥy; 4:163) or guidance (hudā; 6:84) from God. In both lists his name appears next to that of his son Solomon. Elsewhere, the Quran explains that God gave to both of them the gifts of \\"sound judgment\\" (ḥukm; 21:79) and \\"knowledge\\" (ʿilm; 21:79; 27:15). Yet the Quran also ascribes to David merits that distinguish him from Solomon: David killed Goliath (2:251Quran Surah Al-Baqara ( Verse 251 )) and received a divine revelation named the Psalms (17:55 uses an indefinite form while 21:105 uses the definite form al-zabūr), presumably a reference to the Psalms or the Psalter (the term zabūr is perhaps related to Hebrew mizmōr or Syriac mazmūrā, \\"psalm\\"). The mountains and the birds praised God along with David (21:79; in 34:10 God commands them to do so; cf. Psalm 148:7–10). God made David a \\"vicegerent\\" (khalīfa; 38:26), a title that the Quran otherwise gives only to Adam (2:30). This title suggests that, to the Quran, David was something more than a messenger: he was a divinely guided leader who established God’s rule on earth. This role is also suggested by 2:251: \\"God gave him authority (mulk) and wisdom (ḥikmah) and taught him what He willed. If God did not drive back some people by others, the earth would become corrupt.\\" Among the things taught to David was the ability to make armour (21:80, 34:10–11), a suggestion that David’s military exploits were the act of God. It is also important that the Quranic reference to David's \\"wisdom\\" was sometimes explained by the classical exegetes as the gift of prophecy.e.g. Ṭabarī, Taʾrīkh, i, 559 The Quran also connects David and Jesus, by insisting that both cursed those Israelites who did not believe (5:78). Moreover, according to the Quran, David was given the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood when dispensing justice (faṣl al-khiṭāb, 38:20). Furthermore, there is the allusion to a test David was put through, wherein he prayed and repented and God forgave him (38:24-5). Surat Sad (the 38th chapter of the Quran) is also called \\"the sūra of David\\"Hibat Allāh b. Salāma, al-Nāsikh wa-l-mansūkh (in the margin of Wāḥidī, Asbāb), Cairo 1316/1898-9, 262 Exegetes explain that since David prostrated when asking God to forgive him, Muhammad was ordered to imitate him and to perform a prostration when reading this chapter.Bukhārī, Ṣaḥīḥ, vi, 155  Religious significance  David is one of the few Islamic Prophets who received Kingship as well. While other prophets preached during the reign of kings, David, in his time, was the king. Thus, he received an extremely large task, of making sure that the people of Israel were not only held in check spiritually but that the country itself remained strong as well. His place as both leader and prophet is revered by all Muslims as one of extremely high rank. The figure of David, together with that of his prophetic son, Solomon, are iconic of people who ruled justly over their land. God frequently mentions David's high rank as a prophet and messenger in the Quran. He is often mentioned alongside other prophets to emphasize how great he was. For example, God says: When the Caliph 'Umar visited Jerusalem, the Patriarch Sophronius accompanied him on the Temple Mount, while he searched for the Mihrab Dawud (David's prayer-niche) to perform a prayer. Later commentators identified this site with the Tower of David. In a hadith, the prayer and fasting of David is mentioned to be dear to God.  The Book of David  The Zabur is the holy book attributed to David by God, just as Musa (Moses) received the Tawrat (Torah), Isa (Jesus) received the Injil (Gospel) and Muhammad received the Quran. In the current Hebrew Bible, the Zabur is known as the Psalms. However, like other scriptures of the past, the Psalms are believed to have been corrupted over time, with some of the original message now gone. Nonetheless, Muslims are told to treat the present Psalms with immense respect because, in their original form, they too were an inspired Book of God. The Quran states: The term Zabur is the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew Zimra, meaning \\"song/music.\\" It, along with Zamir (\\"song\\") and Mizmor (\\"Psalm\\"), is a derivative of Zamar, meaning \\"sing\\", \\"sing praise\\", \\"make music\\". Thus, David is also usually attributed the gifts of music and song.  Bibliography   Primary  * ʿAbdallāh b. al-Mubārak, Kitāb al-Zuhd, ed. Ḥ.R. al-Aʿẓamī, Beirut n.d., 161-4 * Aḥmad b.

He mastered Arabic, Persian, and French languages and worked as a civil servant during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. He contributed to the literary magazine Servet-i Fünun (\\"Wealth of Knowledge\\") until it was censored by the Ottoman government in 1901.  Biography  Süleyman Nazif was born in 1870 in Diyarbakır to Sait Pasha, a poet and historian. He was the brother of renowned Turkish poet and politician Faik Ali Ozansoy. He started his education in his very early years in Maraş. Later, he was schooled in Diyarbakır. In 1879, he joined his father again in Maraş, took private lessons from his father and in French language from an Armenian priest. Following the death of his father in 1892, Süleyman Nazif worked at several posts in the Governorate of Diyarbakır. In 1896, he was promoted and worked a while in Mosul. After moving to Constantinople, he started to write articles against Sultan Abdul Hamid II sympathizing with the ideas and aims of the Young Ottomans. He fled to Paris, France, where he stayed eight months continuing to write opposing articles in the newspapers. When he returned home, he was forced to work at a secretary post in the Governorate of Bursa between 1897 and 1908. In 1908, Süleyman Nazif moved to Istanbul again, joined the Committee of Union and Progress and started journalism. He also co-founded a newspaper, Tasvir-i Efkar, together with the renowned journalist Ebüzziya Tevfik. Although this newspaper had to close soon, his articles made him a well-known writer. After Sultan Abdülhamid II restored the constitutional monarchy following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, Süleyman Nazif served as governor of Ottoman provinces Basra (1909), Kastamonu (1910), Trabzon (1911), Mosul (1913) and Baghdad (1914). However, since he was not very successful in administrative posts, he decided in 1915 to leave public service and return to his initial profession as a writer. During the Armenian Genocide, Nazif was instrumental in preventing massacres from occurring in the province of Baghdad. In one instance, Nazif had intercepted a convoy of deportees numbering 260 Armenian women and children who were being sent to their deaths. Nazif demanded that the convoy be transferred to a safer zone in Mosul but his proposal was ultimately refused. The convoy was eventually massacred. During his time as governor of Baghdad, Nazif visited Diyarbakir where he encountered a \\"pungent smell of decaying corpses\\" which \\"pervaded the atmosphere and that the bitter stench clogged his nose, making him gag.\\" Nazif was critical of Dr. Mehmed Reshid, the governor of Diyarbakir, who was known as the \\"Butcher of Diyarbakir\\". Nazif, who stated that Reshid \\"destroyed through massacre thousands of humans\\" also wrote about a committee established by Reshid with the objective of providing a 'solution of the Armenian question'. The committee had its own military unit and was called the 'Committee of Inquiry'. Nazif also encouraged other governors not to proceed with the deportation order. In a letter written to his brother Faik Ali Bey, the governor of Kutahya, Nazif wrote, \\"Don't participate in this event, watch out for our family's honor.\\" On November 23, 1918, Nazif's article titled Kara Bir Gün (literally: A Black Day) was published in the newspaper Hadisat to condemn the French occupying forces in Istanbul. The article led to the commander of the French forces sentencing Nazif to execution by firing squad. The order was rescinded, however. As a result of a speech he gave on January 23, 1920 at a meeting to commemorate the French writer Pierre Loti, who had lived a while in Constantinople, Süleyman Nazif was forced into exile on Malta by the occupying British military. During his stay of around twenty months in Malta, he wrote the novel Çal Çoban Çal. After the Turkish War of Independence, he returned to Constantinople and continued to write. Nazif, ever critical of the European imperialist powers, attracted once more their hostility when he wrote his satirical article \\"Hazret-i İsa'ya Açık Mektup\\" (Open Letter to Jesus) in which he described to Jesus all the crimes that were perpetrated by his followers in his name. Two weeks later he published \\"The Reply of Jesus\\" in which he, as if Jesus was talking, refuted the charges and replied that he is not responsible for the Christians' crimes. These two letters caused a furore among Christians in Turkey and Europe, putting Nazif on the verge of being put on trial. In the end this did not materialize, Nazif apologizing but being not less critical of the \\"Crusader mentality\\" of the imperialist Europeans, targeting Turkey in order to extend their power on its soil. ) Edirnekapı Cemetery in Istanbul. He died of pneumonia on January 4, 1927 and was interred at the Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery.

Morel never visited England to see the English garden style, but his book profited from the published theories of Thomas Whately and Claude-Henri Watelet and from the experience he had gained from his close association with the marquis de Girardin at Ermenonville. Girondin's own De la Composition des paysages appeared in 1777. History Morel was chief architect to the Princes of Conti from as early as 1765. John Harris has identified Mme de Boufflers,Comtesse de Boufflers (1725-1800) the mistress and hostess of Louis-François de Bourbon, prince de Conti (1717–76), the friend and support of Rousseau and the first woman of fashion to open her salon to foreigners, as the first French gardener in a landscape style that genuinely could be called \\"Brownian\\", that is, reflective of the style of Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown.John Harris, \\"L'Idole du Temple: The First French Gardener in the Brownian Style\\" Garden History 29.1, (\\"Lancelot Brown (1716-83) and the Landscape Park\\") (Summer 2001), pp. 36-47). Harris's article supplies most of the details in this section. On her return from England in 1765, she immediately grassed over her gardens, both at the Hôtel Saint-Simon in the Temple, Paris and then at the house at Auteuil, which she acquired in 1773. The results— \\"begotten by her on an English gardener\\" Horace Walpole remarked—John Harris identifies him as Mr. Prescot. which were a revelation to all Paris, must have been deeply impressive to the Conti architect, Morel. Ermenonville Morel was the architect in charge at Ermenonville from the mid 1760s.Harris 2001:45f. Harris's main subject is Mme de Boufflers. He enjoyed a long career that was focused almost entirely on garden design. He worked on some four dozen parks and gardens, including Guiscard, Arcelot, Couternon, Ermenonville, Casson, Launay and La Malmaison. His popular treatise offers extensive descriptions of Guiscard and Ermenonville, as illustrative examples. Where we have documentation, as at Ermenonville, it appears that Morel claims more credit for its design than is due. Of all French gardeners of the picturesque school, he stood furthest from the fashionable and decorative Anglo-chinois aspects of garden design, with its crowded and petty effects, and advocated a broader, plainer style, both morally meaningful and more directly imitative of nature.Agnieszka Morawinska, \\"Eighteenth-Century 'Paysages Moralisés'\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 38.3 (July 1977), pp. 461-475, quotes from Morel's Théorie. Morel coined the French term for the landscape professional, architecte-paysagiste, as early as 1804; his ideas were far more influential on the later landscape style of the early nineteenth century than on his immediate contemporaries.

It is uncommonly used in humans as an antipsychotic drug. Azaperone acts primarily as a dopamine antagonist but also has some antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties as seen with similar drugs such as haloperidol. Azaperone may cause hypotension and while it has minimal effects on respiration in pigs, high doses in humans can cause respiratory depression.  Veterinary use  The most common use for azaperone is in relatively small doses to reduce aggression in farmed pigs, either to stop them fighting or to encourage sows to accept piglets. Higher doses are used for anesthesia in combination with other drugs such as xylazine, tiletamine and zolazepam. Azaperone is also used in combination with strong narcotics such as etorphine or carfentanil for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants. Use in horses is avoided as adverse reactions may occur. The European Medicines Agency has established a maximum residue limit for azaperone when administered to pigs. Azaperone (under the brand name Stresnil) was approved for use in pigs in the USA in 1983, under NADA 115-732.

Feng was described as ugly in his appearance, and when he first met Gao Xianzhi and asked to be a guard for Gao, Gao initially rejected him, but eventually agreed to take Feng as a soldier under his command. He distinguished himself under the commands of Gao and Wang Zhengjian (), particularly in a battle against Greater Bolü (大勃律, near modern Gilgit- Baltistan, Pakistan) in 753, eventually commissioned as a military governor (jiedushi). After failing to defeat An Lushan's rebellion in 755, however, both he and Gao were executed due to accusations against them made by the eunuch Bian Lingcheng ().  Background  Feng Changqing's family was from Yishi (猗氏, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His maternal grandfather had committed a crime and was exiled to Shymkent, to serve in the Tang Dynasty army, as part of the army for Anxi Circuit (安西, headquartered in modern Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang) with the responsibility to guard the south gate of the non-Han portion of the city. Feng's grandfather was learned, and often sat with Feng on the gate tower to teach him, giving Feng a broad education. After his grandfather died, Feng was in his 30s, but was poor and alone. At that time, Fumeng Lingcha () was the military governor (jiedushi) of Anxi, and one of the generals serving under Fumeng was Gao Xianzhi. Gao was considered capable, and retained a corps of 30 guards with handsome clothes. Feng submitted a petition to Gao, asking to be one of the guards, but as Feng was thin, ugly, and walking with a limp with short legs, Gao rejected him. He submitted another petition the next day, and Gao responded, \\"I already have enough guards. Why come again?\\" Feng angrily responded: Gao still did not accept him. Feng stayed outside Gao's house door waiting for Gao to enter and leave, for tens of days. Eventually, Gao could not stand it and added him to the guard corps.  Army service in the Xiyu region  At one point, near the end of Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (727-741), when Gao Xianzhi had been promoted to be Fumeng Lingcha's deputy, Fumeng had put Gao in charge of attacking the rebellious Daxi () tribe. Gao was successful in the attack, and was able to kill or capture nearly all of the rebels. Without having been directed by Gao to do so, Feng drafted a report of the victory on Gao's behalf, clearly stating the geographical features, the strategies used, and details of the victory. He presented it to Gao, who was surprised as how well-written it was and how it had anticipated everything Gao wanted to say. Gao submitted the report written by Feng to Fumeng, unsealed and written on a large banner, to allow the tribes on the way to see the victory. After Gao returned to Anxi headquarters, Fumeng held a feast in his honor, and Fumeng's assistants Liu Tiao () and Dugu Jun () both anxiously asked Gao, \\"Who was it who wrote the report? How did you, Lord, retain such an impressive person?\\" Gao responded, \\"It was my guard Feng Changqing.\\" Liu and Dugu were surprised, and they invited Feng to join the feast as well. Feng thereafter became known to the Anxi headquarter staff, and was given the honorific title of castle defender and made Gao's assistant. He was thereafter several times promoted in rank. In 747, Feng served under Gao in the conquest of Lesser Bolü (小勃律, a city state centering on modern Gilgit, Pakistan). Around the new year 748, after Gao was promoted to be the military governor of Anxi, replacing Fumeng, Feng, at Gao's recommendation, received an honorary commission on the staff of Emperor Xuanzong's oldest son Li Cong the Prince of Qing, but remained at Anxi and served as Gao's assistant, with the position only below the deputy military governor. He often was put in charge of the headquarters when Gao was out conducting campaigns. Gao entrusted his household matters, however, to Zheng Dequan (), the son of Gao's wet nurse, whom Gao treated as a brother and therefore was powerful in the army. On one occasion, because of this, Zheng did not, as was proper under military protocol, salute Feng as a superior officer. Feng ordered Zheng to report to headquarters, and then locked the doors and stated to him: He then yelled out, \\"You, general, must temporarily die to affirm good order in the army.\\" He thus caned Zheng 60 times, and Zheng died. Gao's wife and wet nurse cried bitterly outside but could not get in to save Zheng. They submitted an accusation to Gao, but all Gao said upon reading the accusation was, \\"Alas, he died?\\" When he and Feng met again, neither of them spoke of the matter, as Gao was impressed with Feng's discipline. In addition, when two other generals committed crimes, Feng also killed them, thus reaffirming military discipline. In 751, Gao was initially set to be made the military governor of Hexi Circuit (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu), and he asked that Feng be made his assistant. (Subsequently, though, due to machinations of An Sishun, then military governor of Hexi, who wanted to remain there, Gao was instead recalled to the capital to serve as a general of the imperial guards.) When Wang Zhengjian was named as the military governor of Anxi to replace Gao, he asked Feng to serve as his deputy. When Wang died in 752, Feng was made acting military governor. In 753, he attacked Greater Bolü and forced its submission to Tang. In 754, when he went to Chang'an to meet Emperor Xuanzong, he was given a number of honors and a mansion in Chang'an, and his deceased parents also received posthumous honors; soon thereafter, he was officially made military governor. It was said that Feng was hard-working and frugal, and sometimes rode a mule while commanding the army. He was strict in discipline and awards.  Death  In 755, An Lushan, the military governor of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing), launched a rebellion against Emperor Xuanzong's rule. Late that year, Feng Changqing arrived in Chang'an to meet with Emperor Xuanzong. When they met on December 23,兩千年中西曆轉換 Emperor Xuanzong asked him what should be done. Feng, initially believing that An's rebellion could be defeated quickly, volunteered to head to the eastern capital Luoyang to defend it and then to counterattack. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and commissioned Feng as the military governor of Fanyang and Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) to replace An. That day, Feng headed to Luoyang to gather troops and prepare for defenses. Once he got there, he gathered 60,000 men and destroyed the Yellow River bridge to prepare for attack, but quickly found out that he had a major problem—there were insufficient weapons available for his troops. Meanwhile, An crossed the Yellow River elsewhere and captured Chenliu (陳留, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Yingyang (滎陽, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan) Commanderies, and then arrived at Luoyang. Feng tried to defend with his inadequately-supplied troops, but could not. An entered the city, and Feng was forced to destroy the western gate in order to get out of Luoyang and retreat west. Meanwhile, Gao Xianzhi, who was the acting supreme commander of the forces, was stationed at Shan Commandery (陝郡, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). Feng retreated to Shan, where Emperor Xuanzong sent an order stripping him of titles but allowing him to remain in the army under Gao. Feng warned Gao that Shan Prefecture was difficult to defend—that they should retreat to Tong Pass and fortify its defenses against An's attack. Gao agreed, and they abandoned Shan and withdrew to Tong Pass. When An later arrived, he could not capture it. Meanwhile, though, Feng was detecting signs that he might be in trouble, and anticipatorily wrote a final submission to Emperor Xuanzong, warning him about An's strengths and cautioning against overconfidence, as the other officials at the time generally believed that An could be defeated quickly. Meanwhile, during the campaign, Gao had caused much offense against the eunuch Bian Lingcheng, serving as his monitor, as Bian was making demands of him that he was not meeting. When Bian returned to Chang'an, he accused Feng of exaggerating An's strength, and accused Gao of improperly abandoning Shan as well as corruptly withholding food supplies and imperial rewards to soldiers for personal benefit. Emperor Xuanzong, believing Bian, issued edicts for Feng's and Gao's executions. After Bian returned to Tong Pass, he first read the edict for Feng's execution. Feng, after giving his submission to Bian to submit to Emperor Xuanzong, was beheaded, and upon the completion of that execution, Bian then read the second edict ordering Gao's execution. Gao cried out: The soldiers cried out for Gao as well, but Bian still beheaded Gao. As Gao was to be killed, he looked at Feng's body and stated:  Notes  References * Old Book of Tang, vol. 104. * New Book of Tang, vol. 135. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 216, 217. *Xue, Zongzheng(1998).

Early life Sargood was born in Walworth, London, the eldest child of Frederick James Sargood (later a member of the old Victorian Legislative Council), and Emma, daughter of Thomas Rippon, Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. F. T. Sargood was educated at private schools and arrived with his family aboard the Clifton in Melbourne on 12 February 1850. He initially worked as a clerk in the Public Works Department, but in 1851 joined his father's softgoods business, Sargood, King & Co., and in 1859 became a junior partner in it. In the same year he joined the Victorian volunteer artillery as a private and eventually reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He also took an interest in rifle shooting. In 1858 Sargood married Marian Australia, daughter of George Rolfe, later a politician. Political career In May 1874 Sargood entered the Victorian Legislative Council by winning a by-election for Central Province, and in 1875 he became the first chairman of the Melbourne Harbour Trust. Sargood was a commissioner of savings banks in 1874–80. Sargood's wife Marian died in childbirth on 6 January 1880, he resigned from the council and visited England later the same year with his nine children. Sargood was appointed a delegate by the Victorian government to represent the colony before the Imperial Commission for the protection of British possessions abroad. Sargood married Julia Tomlin on 2 December 1880 on the Isle of Wight and returned to Melbourne in 1882. Sargood held the Legislative Council Province of South Yarra from November 1882 to March 1901. In March 1883 Sargood became an Honorary Minister in the James Service government. In the same year when the Defence Department was formed, he was the first Minister of Defence, and carried through the reorganization of the defences which involved the changeover from volunteer to militia forces. Rifle clubs were formed and the important cadet corps movement for schoolboys was also due to Sargood's efforts. In 1885 he took the additional portfolio of Minister of Water-supply, and held both positions until the resignation of the ministry in February 1886. He was appointed Vice- President of the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of 1888 and subsequently Executive Vice-President and Treasurer. Sargood was also president of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce 1886–1888, and his name stood very high in the business world. When he joined his father's business it was a comparatively small one, but now under the name of Sargood Butler and Nichol it had become one of the largest in Australia, with branches in other cities. It was subsequently extended to New Zealand and before Sargood's death the number of employees was over 5000. When William Hearn died in 1888, Sargood became Leader of the Legislative Council, in which position he examined all bills coming from the Legislative Assembly and showed much critical ability. He joined the James Munro ministry in November 1890 as Minister of Defence and of Education, but withdrew when the ministry was reconstructed under William Shiels in February 1892, because he was unable to agree with Shiels's adhesion to the \\"one man one vote\\" principle. Although Sargood' political leanings were conservative, he had piloted the first Factories Act through the Council with skill, and in his own firm, the Saturday half-holiday had been brought in as far back as 1852. Sargood joined the George Turner government in September 1894 as Minister of Defence, but about three months later again resigned on a question of principle. He again took up the position of Leader of the Council and had a prominent part in the Federation movement. His views on the tariff prevented his being elected as one of the Victorian delegates to the 1897 convention, but at the first federal election in 1901 he was elected as one of the senators for Victoria in spite of the opposition of the protectionist press. When the Senate met he was nominated for the position of President which, however, went to Sir Richard Baker by 21 votes to 12. Sargood, however, took a leading position in the Senate. Late life and legacy Sargood family vault in Gore Hill cemetery, Sydney Rippon Grange, the mansion built for son Frederick George Sargood Sargood was created Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1885 and was knighted KCMG in 1890. He died suddenly while on a holiday in Taihape, New Zealand on 2 January 1903.Otago Daily Times, 19 January 1903. Retrieved 6 June 2016 He was the first serving Australian Senator to die in office. Lady Sargood survived him with five sons and four daughters of the first marriage, and one daughter of the second. Sargood was prominently connected with many philanthropic and religious movements. The large Rippon Lea Estate in Elsternwick was originally built for Sargood in 1868. One son, Frederick George Sargood, moved to Sydney and became a prominent retailer. He lived for a time in Rippon Grange, a mansion in Water Street, Wahroonga, which was designed by Howard Joseland.Federation house wikispaces The Sargood family vault is located in Gore Hill cemetery, St Leonards.

It is an endemic resident breeder in the eastern Cape Province Transkei and western Natal in South Africa, and in Lesotho. This species is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the Cape siskin, Crithagra totta of southern Cape Province, in which case the nominate western form is C. t. totta, and the eastern form is C. t. symonsi. This locally common but shy and unobtrusive siskin is found in the scrubby valleys and hillsides of the Drakensberg mountains. Taxonomy The Drakensberg siskin was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Drakensberg siskin were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra. Description The Drakensberg siskin averages 13–14 cm in length. The tail has white sides, a feature which is diagnostic for both sexes, and especially visible in flight. The adult male has a faintly streaked light brown back, light brown wing coverts, rump and upper tail, and yellow underparts. The head and nape sides are yellowish grey and olive. The throat is bright yellow, but the rest of the underparts are a somewhat duller shade. The female has similar but duller upperparts and has no yellow in the plumage. The head and underparts are buff with much fine dark brown streaks on the head and breast. The juvenile plumage is much like the female's but with heavier streaking. There is no range overlap with the slightly smaller Cape siskin, which has white spots on the flight feathers and tail and more uniform upperparts. The Drakensberg siskin's call is a schwee, often given in flight. and the song, like that of Cape siskin, is a weak, pleasant warble similar to the yellow-fronted canary. Behaviour Breeding One reason for the taxonomic uncertainty with this species is that, if it is a true siskin, it is the only one which breeds in cavities. A shallow cup nest is constructed in cracks or holes in rocks, on ledges or amongst vegetation, especially ferns. Natural hollows in trees are rarely used. The nest is constructed by the female with fine plant material, lined with plant down and animal hair. The clutch is three or four, occasionally five, eggs, incubated by the female. She is fed by the male on the nest by regurgitation. Feeding The Drakensberg siskin is seen in pairs or small flock, moving unobtrusively through bushes and scrub as it forages for seeds (including proteas), buds and insects.

It was released in April 2007 at the Tribeca Film Festival. Plot Television executive Katy develops what she hopes will become the most watched television show of all time, the ultimate game show called Live!, in which six contestants play Russian roulette with a revolver with six chambers loaded with one live cartridge and five dummy cartridges. During the show, after the cylinder is randomly turned, the six will fire the gun one by one pointed at their head, without intermediate extra turning of the cylinder, until one is killed. At first the idea is to give each of the six contestants $1,000,000, but while there are more applicants at the auditions than expected, they are suicidal people. This is not desired, the contestants should want to live; therefore the prize is raised to $5,000,000 each for the surviving contestants, while the family of the killed contestant does not get any prize. As the TV executive struggles to overcome the challenges by the Federal Communications Commission, her network, and the show's advertisers, a documentary filmmaker, Rex, films every detail of her glamorous, high-powered life. Rex becomes involved in the making of the show by creating biographical segments about the contestants. They are Byron, a young, struggling writer; Brad, an extreme sports star; Rick, a man who had to spend much on medical bills for his young son and is now trying to save his family's farm; Jewel, an aspiring actress; Abalone, a former supermodel turned performance artist; and Pablo, a young, gay Mexican immigrant determined to help his family. Jewel is first, Pablo next, both are unharmed. Next is Abalone; before pulling the trigger with the gun pointed at herself she does a performance in which she frightens others by pointing the gun at them; she is also unharmed, but plays falling dead. The fourth is Byron, also unharmed. Brad is fifth and kills himself. Katy is shocked and feels guilty, and goes to the bathroom to throw up. The body is quickly removed off-camera. Rick, who would be sixth, wins the prize without having to pull the trigger. After that, during the after-show press gang, a man comes forward with another gun and kills Katy. The network claims the murder is unrelated to the theme of the show. Apart from the murder the show is a success. It has become an annual broadcast. Cast {  - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" ! Actor !!

It was one of the \\"gimmick comedies\\" (geared towards children with a touch of adult humor for older viewers) Disney was known for in the 1960s and 1970s, and was frequently shown on The Wonderful World of Disney from the late 1970s through the 1980s.  Plot  A satire of network television, the movie follows the adventures of an ambitious mailroom clerk, Steven Post (Russell) at the fictional struggling UBC (United Broadcasting Corporation) Network. Post discovers that a chimpanzee named Raffles, left in the care of his girlfriend Jennifer Scott (played by Heather North) by neighbors who moved to San Francisco, has the uncanny ability to choose which television programs will succeed or fail with audiences. While watching a program, Raffles blows a raspberry at shows he hates and claps his hands at shows he likes. Post smuggles the chimp into the UBC building when various programs are being previewed for executives and watches as the chimp gives his vote from the projection room. The first program that receives Raffles's approval is a movie named \\"Devil Dan\\". Post tells the programming executives that \\"Devil Dan\\" will draw large audiences. The executives disagree and choose not to program the movie. To prove he's got a sure-fire way of choosing hits, Post sneaks into UBC's broadcast center to switch the reels. Executives are outraged when \\"Devil Dan\\" airs - but Post is proved right. The movie propels UBC to first place in the ratings war. Post successfully masks the chimp's abilities as his own and rises to vice president of UBC, now the top-rated area network. However, this also creates suspicion and resentment among UBC executives, mainly because they believe Post is too young to merit the title of vice president. Their resentment reaches a breaking point at a television award ceremony where Steven Post receives the title of \\"Television's Man of the Year\\" and the emcee mistakenly identifies Post as the president of UBC. Fearing that Post's seemingly miraculous abilities will make their own jobs unnecessary, network executives E. J. Crampton (Morgan) and Francis X. Wilbanks (Joe Flynn) attempt to discover his secret to success. One toady (Wally Cox) sees a bunch of bananas in Post's apartment, which leads to a humorous scene where the executives are seen eating bananas as they believe an idea that a New Guinea tribe considered bananas to be brain food. The flunky also hears sounds coming from Post's closet and believes he is holding a hostage, which serves to intensify the surveillance of Post and his new luxury apartment. Using a spyglass to peer through his apartment window at night, the toady discovers the chimpanzee watching television with Post. Upon spying the chimp going to the refrigerator for a beer during the commercial break, the executives realize the chimpanzee's true abilities. Fearing the revelation that America's favorite TV programs were being picked by a primate would spell the end of television, the executives decide to steal the chimpanzee and return it to the jungle. Wilbanks and his chauffeur, Albert Mertons (Cox) venture out a narrow ledge in an attempt to snatch the chimp out of Post's apartment in his absence. The plan goes awry and the duo become stranded on the ledge until the police, the fire department, and a Catholic priest arrive, mistaking their break in for a potential suicide. As a last-ditch effort, the network offers Post $1,000,000 in exchange for the chimp, which he ultimately accepts. Jennifer becomes disenchanted with him when she finds out he sold her pet for money without her consent and breaks off their relationship. She also does not believe her chimpanzee should be released into the wild. Meanwhile, executives from every studio and camera crews crowd a cargo plane soaring over the jungle, as they prepare to parachute the chimp into an unexplored section of the Amazon; but before arriving at the intended disembarkation point, the stubborn chimpanzee, not wanting to be sent into the wild, pulls a lever opening an emergency hatch which sucks all the executives out of the plane, causing them to parachute into the jungle instead. Albert Mertons, who is now more sympathetic to Jennifer's feelings, reveals to Steven that the chimp outsmarted the executives and is now en route back to the United States. Post uses this opportunity to refund the $1,000,000 for the chimp. Post comments that UBC is going to need the money now in order to fund a search party for Wilbanks and the other executives. Jennifer and Steven have not only rekindled their relationship, but are now married and set off on their honeymoon with the chimpanzee in tow as their pet. The final scenes shows the Posts on an expressway which pans out in a wide scene, while a radio announcement says that Post has just married and resigned his vice presidency of UBC, but many people are wishing him well in his future endeavors.

The station's studios and offices are Located at the 4th Floor, PIA/Media Center Building, Visayas Ave. Barangay Vasra, Diliman, Quezon City and its transmitter at Barangay Marulas, Valenzuela City. As of October 2020, the station's broadcast hours are from 6:00am to 8:00pm, with an audio-only simulcast of the DepEd TV programming service occupies the whole slot from 7:00am to 7:00pm. As Radyo Magasin, it is the PBS's general information radio station. It primarily focused on news, current events, and Philippine culture. Its broadcasting format is akin to the format of a printed magazine, thus its name. History Radyo Magasin logo The station was launched in 1987 as Radyo Maynila (the brand was previously used at 918 kHz during the Marcos regime prior to EDSA Revolution) under the helm of former actor and BBS-PBS interim director Jose Mari Gonzales. Gonzales ordered that all BBS radio station will give their respective identities including Radyo ng Bayan (918 kHz), Sports Radio (738 kHz) and DZRP-Radyo Pagasa. In the late-1990s/early 2000s, the station was reformatted as a cultural-oriented station under the name Radyo Magasin. Between 2007 and 2009, DZRM aired the Spanish cultural magazine show, Filipinas, Ahora Mismo. On September 17, 2017, Radyo Magasin finally went dark for the last time, after almost 30 years of broadcasting. Its programming merged with DZSR's programming on Radyo Pilipinas Dos, which was launched the next day. The defunct station's audio streaming space, meanwhile, was then converted to DWFO's audio portal on November 1 after it started a series of tests broadcasts. In October 2020, PBS resumed the broadcast operations of DZRM. The following week, however, began airing the audio simulcast of the DepEd TV programming as part of the country's distance learning initiative amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

There were two stations on the site, the first, called \\"Ashton\\", opened in either 1841 or 1852 and closed in 1856. The second station, originally known as \\"Long Ashton Platform\\" before being renamed as \\"Long Ashton\\" in 1929, was operational from 1926 to 1941. The site is now partly under the A370 Long Ashton Bypass, and there are no visible remains of the station. There is local support for the station to be reopened, possibly sited further to the west, and possibly as part of the University of Bristol's proposed Fenswood Farm development.  First station  The Bristol and Exeter Railway was opened between and on 14 June 1841, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and build originally as broad-gauge. A station named \\"Ashton\\", serving the nearby village of Long Ashton, was located on an embankment from and from the Great Western Railway terminus at London Paddington.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. Quite when the station opened is uncertain – Butt's Directory of Railway Stations states that the station opened with the line in June 1841, but Quick's Railway Passenger Stations states it only opened in June 1852. Both sources agree that the station closed in January 1856, however other sources such as Oakley's Somerset Railway Stations contain no reference to Ashton at all. If the earlier date is correct, services would have originally been provided by the Great Western Railway on behalf of the Bristol & Exeter. The Bristol & Exeter took over passenger operations on 1 May 1849. The line through Ashton remained open after the station closed. In 1871, the Bristol & Exeter opened another station called Ashton, closer to Bristol, this station was later renamed . The line had been reconstructed as mixed-gauge by 1 June 1875 to accommodate local traffic. A year later in 1876, the Bristol & Exeter was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway, which took over services. Broad-gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892.  Second station  The station was reopened by the Great Western Railway in 1926, now called Long Ashton Platform; Ashton by then was the name of a station on the Teign Valley Line in Devon. Again, the exact date of opening is disputed: most sources state 12 July 1926, but some say 20 September the same year. It was located on the same site as the first station. The station was a basic halt, and had two platforms. A corrugated iron shelter and lamp hut were provided on the westbound platform, and a small booking office was present on the road to the platform. The estimated cost of construction was £1,930. The station was renamed Long Ashton on 23 September 1929, and closed on 6 October 1941. There is now no trace of it left, and the site is now partly under the A370 Long Ashton Bypass causeway.  Future  Plans were submitted in 2010 to reopen the station as part of the University of Bristol's Fenswood Farm development, which, if granted planning permission, will comprise some 1,200 houses, businesses and a school spread over . The new station would be up to west of the original location. The University notes that there is positive support for the station, but that it alone cannot guarantee its construction. Long Ashton parish councillor Anthony Butcher opposes the development, but supports the reopening of the station. The station could be reopened as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan approved in July 2012 which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. The Bristol to Exeter line through Long Ashton is not currently electrified. The 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line will see the line from London to Bristol electrified, but electrification will not extend beyond Bristol to . The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing to Weston, as does Member of Parliament for Weston-super-Mare, John Penrose.

It is a form of secondary issue where a company's cash reserves are converted into new shares and given to existing shareholders, or an issue of additional shares to shareholders in proportion to the shares already held. A scrip issue is usually done when a company does not have sufficient liquidity to pay a cash dividend. A company declaring a scrip dividend gives the shareholders the option to either receive the dividend in cash or to receive additional shares. This is different than a bonus issue as shareholders do not have a choice with a bonus issue event. Scrip dividends are in some ways similar to DRIPs as they give the shareholders the option to receive the dividend in cash or stock. Unlike DRIPs, however, Scrip dividends are exempt from stamp duty and not subject to brokerage / dealing fees, because they are considered a stock issue by the company and not a reinvestment by the shareholder. The issue is calculated relative to existing holdings. This means that, for example, one new 'scrip' share may be issued for every ten shares currently owned. The company issuing the scrip shares has now expanded the number of shares in existence, but not increased the value of the company. This means that the relative value of each pre-existing share has been reduced slightly. The investor has the right to sell the new scrip shares in the market. However, the investor must still report the cash value of the scrip dividend on his tax return like a normal cash dividend. This differs from a stock dividend in the United States, where the investor does not pay any tax on receipt of the shares and then only capital gains taxes on the stock dividend until the shares are sold.

Stroefer’s Kunstverlag The \\"Song of the Bell\\" (German: \\"Das Lied von der Glocke\\", also translated as \\"The Lay of the Bell\\") is a poem that the German poet Friedrich Schiller published in 1798. It is one of the most famous poems of German literature and with 430 lines also one of the longest. In it, Schiller combines a knowledgeable technical description of a bell founding with points of view and comments on human life, its possibilities and risks.  Origin  As a small boy Schiller came in contact with the trade of bell founding because Georg Friderich Neubert, the son of the Ludwigsburg bell founder, was a classmate at his Latin school and the Schiller family lived only a few doors away from the casting house. It is also considered to be certain that Schiller visited the Neubert family again during his stay in Ludwigsburg 1793/94. More than ten years passed between the first basic idea for the poem and its completion. During this time Schiller closely observed the sequence of operations in a bell foundry. In the family of the Rudolstädt bell founder Johann Mayer it was related from generation to generation, \\"how Schiller repeatedly visited the casting works and interrogated the casting master, who at first was not pleased about this disruption to the work, and how the pale scholar considerately took a seat at the wall in a high-backed chair in order not to disturb the work.\\" http://www.schiller-institut.de/seiten/schill98.htm  Contents   Motto  The first indented line between the title and the first stanza is in Latin and reads \\"Vivos voco. Mortuos plango. Fulgura frango\\", approximately translating as \\"I call the living, I mourn the dead, I repel lightning.\\"There was an old popular belief that a tolling bell drives away lightning.  Bell casting and the course of life  A look at the assembled form: The first stanza calls attention to the preliminary work which precedes the actual casting process. The clay form is in a banked pit ready to be filled with the molten metal. The molten wax method is described, in which a wax model of the bell is first made. Because in the course of the casting both the model and the form are destroyed the procedure is also known as the lost wax process. :Giving meaning to work: The first observation marks the actual beginning of the poem. Nobody who carries out any work should do it thoughtlessly, but must rather put his heart into it. Preparing the alloy for casting: Schiller describes the wood fuel, the opening in the smelting furnace through which the flame sweeps over the metal, the door which permits the fire to be stirred up and when closed forces the flame into the furnace. One has to imagine the casting pit as being close to the furnace where the metal is stacked up. First the copper is introduced, and when that is liquefied the easier-to-melt tin is added. :Attesting to life’s milestones: The second observation describes the subject of the poem in more detail. The bell which is created in the depths of the pit will sing the praises of the casting master when it is later up in the belfry. It will outlast many generations, and accompany every transition in human life. Melting the alloy: When the three parts copper and one part tin are melted, a white foam forms on the surface which captures any impurities. Its formation is facilitated by the addition of potasch. :From baptism to first love: The third observation begins with describing childhood. Solemnly the bell greets the child who is to be baptized. His fate is however uncertain. His mother watches over his first years of life. Later the young man leaves his sweetheart behind and goes out into the world. When he returns she has become a blossoming young woman and he falls in love with her and experiences the transitory, “splendid moment of first love.” Inspecting the melt: At the furnace are windpipes or draft holes which can be opened or closed, as needed. After the metal has been in the furnace for 12 hours the pipes turn yellow indicating that it is time for casting. But first a test is made by dipping a little rod into the liquefied metal. If it looks as if it has been glazed, then it is assumed that the brittle copper has merged with the softer tin. :Wedding bell and allocation of roles: In the fourth observation the bell calls people to the wedding celebration which is the climax of the happy love affair, after which it makes place for family life. The stanza continues by describing a traditional family, with the man going out into a hostile world while at home the virtuous housewife prevails. Starting the casting: First a short prayer is recited and then a small amount of metal is poured into a depression in a warm rock. When it has cooled it is broken apart and the size of the jagged teeth at the fractured surface reveals whether the melting process has come to an end or not. If they are too short, copper has to be added, if they are too long, tin. In order to guide the metal into the form, cone shaped pins are pushed in. The hole thus created lets the melt stream out, first into a curved trough and then into the bell form. :Fire alarm bell: the fifth observation is about how erratic happiness is. Beginning with the fire that causes the metals to melt, Schiller also describes its destructive power in a very dynamic series of descriptions: “roof beams collapse, pillars crash down, windows shatter, children wail, mothers dash around in panic… everyone runs, rescues, flees.” Filling the bell form: The form has been filled with the melt, now one has to wait to find out whether the work is well done. The master craftsman cannot yet rejoice because he does not know if the casting was successful. :Death knell upon the decease of the woman: Just as the master entrusts his cast to the earth, so the peasant entrusts his seedlings to the earth, and so the dead are put into the ground, so that they can rise from the dead in the hereafter. The bell now has an earnest purpose and tolls in accompaniment to a funeral. In Goethe’s Epilogue on Schiller’s Bell (Epilog zu Schillers Glocke) the motif of the death knell is picked up and applied to Schiller’s own death. Cooling down the bell: After all the strenuous work, peace reigns while the metal cools. The workers enjoy a break while the master prepares for the next step. :A peaceful evening after the day's work: This stanza describes a peaceful autumn evening in a country town. A hiker returns home through the woods as herds of sheep and cows are driven to their stalls. A heavily loaded harvest wagon drives in through the gate; farmhands and maidservants head for the harvest dance. It slowly gets dark and the town gates are closed. The upright inhabitants have no fear of the dark and can (from the German) \\"sleep the sleep of the just\\" since the night watchman, “the eye of the law,” is patrolling the streets. This is considered one of the early literary uses of the much translated phrase. But this sacred order can only last as long as peace reigns. Destroying the bell casing: After cooling, the casing starts to separate from the baked clay, which is now smashed with a hammer. In a reference to the Resurrection, the poem asserts “If the bell is to rise from the ground / The form has to break apart.” Concordia shall be the name. Illustration by Liezen-Mayer :Alarm bell and storm damage: ::The master can break the form, ::In time, and with a cautious hand ::But beware if in a fiery flow ::The glowing metal frees itself! But sociable happiness does not rest on unshakeable pillars. Schiller takes as his theme the French Revolution of 1789 and criticizes the inhuman Jacobin excesses, “Where women turn into hyenas / And poke fun at horrors.” Here Schiller presents a very pessimistic view of mankind. The finished bell: Now the bell slowly comes to light and the viewers can admire the coats of arms on the outside.Schiller's contemporary August Wilhelm Schlegel criticized the lack of a clapper, a lack which other authors also ridiculed. The bell's christening on a Hamburg medal of August Fischer and Christian Schnitzspahn issued for the celebration of Schiller's 100th birthday in 1859. Christening the bell: the master craftsman calls the workers together to christen the bell. Now it can be raised to the belfry in order to fill its destiny. He encourages his workmen, “pull, pull, lift! / It moves, it hangs.” And the \\"Song of the Bell\\" concludes with the words, ::Be a joy to this town ::May the first tolling denote peace.  Reception  First reactions to the \\"Song of the Bell\\" were without exception positive. Its success was attributed to each person's being able to find meaning in it. At a solemn meeting of the Royal Academy in Schiller Year 1859, Jacob Grimm praised “this incomparable poem, far superior to what other peoples can offer,” and declared it to be a national symbol of unity Norbert Oellers (Hrsg.): Gedichte von Friedrich Schiller.). But despite great enthusiasm for Schiller's longest poem there was also considerable criticism. It was too emotional, too lofty, too garrulous; people criticized technical details, and over 100 parodies were written. Those of the 19th century were not critical of the original, which was greatly admired, but instead strived to make use of this very well known poem for their own ends. The late nineteenth century English author George Gissing encouraged his eighteen-year-old sister, Margaret, who was learning German at the time to read it in the original (as well as other works by Schiller). Gissing wrote in his letter that it was \\"one of the most glorious poems ever written, but a little difficult\\".Letters of George Gissing to members of his family. Collected and arranged by Algernon and Ellen Gissing. London: Constable, 1927, letter to Margaret dated 9/11/1881 Many Bell parodies shifted the observations about the production process to the production of food and drinks like bread, beer and coffee.  Recitations and musical settings  Goethe wrote his epilogue to the \\"Song of the Bell\\" shortly after Schiller's death in order to have it read by the actress Amalie Becker at the conclusion of a memorial celebration in the Lauchstädt Theater. After the three last acts of Maria Stuart, the \\"Song of the Bell\\" was recited with distributed roles. Other performances of the Bell took place especially in schools in the 19th century. In Hamburg the Bell was portrayed by local people in so-called living pictures on the occasion of Schiller Year 1859. Among the various music versions are Andreas Romberg: Das Lied von der Glocke, op. 111 (Romberg was a colleague of Beethoven, who set to music Schiller's ode An die Freude (Ode to Joy)) and Max Bruch: Das Lied von der Glocke, op. 45 (Bruch's work has been called a musical “Bible for the man in the street”).  As German cultural heritage  In the 19th century Schiller was read and honored not only by schoolteachers, but also by craftsmen and workers, as an initiator of national unity. Until about 1955 the Bell was an essential part of the Volksschule 8th. Klasse as well as high school curriculum and regarded as part of German cultural heritage. It was regarded as a treasury of sayings; well known collections list a large number of verses from the \\"Song of the Bell\\" which continue to be quoted today as part of the German cultural heritage, sometimes without awareness of the source.  Translations  Schiller's \\"Song of the Bell\\" has been translated into many languages. Already in 1877 there were translations into French, Dutch, Norwegian, English, Italian, Latvian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Czech, Danish, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Slovene, Sorbian, Romanian, etc., not counting all the translations into various German dialects.

The name has sometimes been applied to similar suits of armor that appear in his other works, such as Ghost in the Shell, but this is generally a misnomer since these examples carry their own distinct names, notably the Fuchikoma, and differ somewhat in design.Ghost in the Shell (manga), Volume One. Landmates fall under the umbrella term of mecha, which generically describes a man-like machine or mechanized protection garment, popular in Japanese fiction and pop-culture. In Appleseed, a large variety of Landmates exist, ranging from civilian construction unitsAppleseed Ex Machina to heavily armed anti-gravity flight units employed by various police forces, armies, and even well-financed terrorist organizations. Most are similar in dimension, regardless of purpose, and stand between twelve and twenty feet tall,Appleseed ID, Shirow Masamune. making them one of the smaller examples of Japanese mecha.  Design  While there are countless versions of Landmates, including many not depicted in either the manga or animeMasamune once bemoaned the \\"sad world of lost mecha,\\" referring to the many designs he couldn't integrate into his stories, and subsequently discarded. A few appear in the graphical encyclopedia Appleseed Hypernotes. (apparently there are even some designed for pest control purposes),Appleseed book one, \\"The Promethean Challenge,\\" Shirow Masamune.\\" all postwar, Olympus-built units seem to follow a fundamental design, a two-legged suit with four arms (two large ones, and two small flexible sheaths that contain the wearer's arms and are used for motion control), with a large chest cavity (where the wearer sits, their legs resting inside the partially hollow legs of the machine itself), and a camera- equipped head. There is no glass windshield on most Landmates (other than civilian construction models) as this would compromise the tank-like armor capabilities; instead the wearer perceives his or her surroundings using a panoramic LCD monitor assembly inside the chest-cavity cockpit. Various heads- up displays are superimposed on the screens, the layout of which the pilot can personalize. Although the screen is integral to the routine operation of a Landmate, it is possible to pilot one without, such as in an emergency situation, as depicted twice in the film Appleseed Ex Machina. As mentioned, Landmates have four arms. The two large ones are used for carrying items, frequently large weapons, and employ jointed, five-fingered mechanical hands. The two smaller arms, located below the first pair, are hollow and flexible sheaths, that contain the pilot's arms. Most military and police Landmates have a lightly armored, fingered glove at the end of the control arms, allowing the pilot to use their own hand for special purposes or weapons handling, whereas civilian models typically have a protective steel mitt.  Control methods  Piloting a Landmate is a unique experience, given that the craft behaves as an extension of the human body, one that just does everything its wearer is doing. There are seemingly no physical controls in the cockpit,Appleseed XIII depicts that there several push-buttons in the cockpit that can be actuated when the cockpit hatch is in the open position. rather control is accomplished through motion-capture technology (very similar to that used to animate the movies) via the pilot's Datasuit, an undergarment that records nerve and muscle impulses.Appleseed Hypernotes, Shirow Masamune. The electrostatic information gathered by the suit is then wirelessly relayed to a central processing unit, that manipulates the various motors and joint servos in order to mimic the pilot's motions in a proportionate, but much bigger scale.  Hazards  The piloting process of a Landmate introduces several dangers to its human pilot. Walking or running, the very first activity to master, involves the user adapting their leg movements to the scale of the twenty-foot tall machine, whose stride will traverse three to four times more ground than their own, and the risk of tripping over obstacles is something few professionals underestimate. Artificial balance equilibrium is also difficult to perfectly accomplish in a Landmate, especially since the center-of-gravity can vary from model to model, and is very much affected by the heft of the handheld weapon—typically the size of a small cannon—being carried in the robotic arms of the machine. Rash or sudden motions jeopardize the Landmate's stability and can threaten to easily topple it. In hostile scenarios, a small group of ordinary humans, if skilled, can roll-over an erect Landmate by precisely striking the ankles, as demonstrated by rioters in Appleseed Ex Machina. Also, the hips of the machine can be easily dislocated, and untrained running is the primary cause of such accidents. As the user's legs pass through the Landmate's hips, a severe dislocation could easily break their bones or sever their legs entirely, so great care must be taken. In the years following the late 2120s, surface hovering, combined with jet- propulsion, has generally replaced running for high-speed transit as it is a lower risk practice.The 1988 Appleseed movie is the only anime portion of the saga that shows Landmates frequently running, whereas the 2004 and 2007 episodes only show surface jet propulsion in ground pursuit scenes.  Safety featuresAppleseed Ex Machina.  Most Landmates appear to have an ejection system, which allows for the rapid escape of the pilot. When triggered, the Landmate's cockpit hatch blows off and over the left shoulder, while the rest of the body falls apart in segments, forcing the human inside forward while the extremities of the machine fall backwards and to the sides. Although it's practically useless while in flight (as the pilot doesn't wear a parachute) the ejection system is useful on the ground. Civilian models, particularly those used in the construction industry, also feature a killswitch, located in various positions but most commonly between the \\"shoulder blades\\" on the back of the Landmate. When triggered, power to all the motors is cut, rapidly incapacitating the machine, should it be malfunctioning. Unusually, the killswitch can't be engaged remotely, which makes accessing it dangerous depending on the circumstances.  History   Early units  Landmates existed in the Appleseed universe well before the events depicted even in the first book of the manga, The Promethean Challenge. While the industrial nation of Poseidon is credited with inventing them in the late 21st century,Appleseed ID, Shirow Masamune. their extensive refinement and widespread public adoption is largely due to private-sector efforts in Olympus. Starting in 2124, first- generation handbuilt models were produced by automotive specialists and marketed as high-end personal transport or niche market construction machinery, and often sold alongside motorbikes and luxury automobiles at independent dealerships. Akechi Motors remains one of the most famous early dealers and promoters of the powered armor suits, as it was here that some of the very first Landmates designed for squad-based law enforcement and counter terrorism were designed, the brainchild of talented mechanic and engineer Yoshitsune Miyamoto.Appleseed book one, \\"The Promethean Challenge,\\" Shirow Masamune.\\"  \\"Guges\\" Landmate  While Miyamoto's private-ownership Landmates had already become known for their quality and unique design, more or less Ferraris of the mecha world, where his efforts revolutionized the market lay in the creation of a prototype law-enforcement Landmate. His principles for this design revolved around several tenets: #Maximum mobility and agility in urban environments (for combat superiority against earlier- generation Landmates)Appleseed (2004 film). #The use of variable-viscosity magneto-fluid bearings (for handling characteristics and shock- absorbency)Appleseed (2004 film).Appleseed book one, \\"The Promethean Challenge,\\" Shirow Masamune.\\" #Minimal use of specialized components (for ease of repairs/upgrades) Appleseed book one, \\"The Promethean Challenge,\\" Shirow Masamune.\\" So popular was his armed Landmate variant, dubbed the Guges, that it quickly became adopted as a standard issue first-response and interceptor mecha for the Olympus S.W.A.T. and elite ES.W.A.T. paramilitary groups, and netted Akechi's first major fleet sale. By 2131, Miyamoto was inducted as a non commissioned officer of ES.W.A.T., and by then had diversified his skills with the addition of cybernetic engineering. Unsurprisingly, one of the first flight-capable Landmates, using Hermes/DamysosIn the manga series, anti- gravity technology, called the \\"Hermes,\\" is said to be a product of Poseidon, whereas in the Appleseed (2004 film) 2004 CGI movie it was referred to as the \\"Damysos.\\" anti-gravity technology, was a late-model Guges, known as the D-Type.Appleseed (2004 film), Appleseed Hypernotes, Shirow Masamune.  Cyborg Landmates  To accommodate large cyborg operatives of ES.W.A.T., special Landmates have since been created, starting with one for use by Briareos Hecatonchires. These units differ by featuring a much larger body cavity, and typically allow the cyborg's head to protrude outside of the body armor panels, allowing them to employ their own cybernetic-vision capabilities. However, Briareos typically still sports a helmet to further fortify himself against headshots by large-caliber ordnance fired by hostiles.

Track Just after leaving the station of Bruneck and after crossing the Rienz, the track followed the Ahr river until the final station in Taufers. Only two bridges were necessary to build the line. One in Uttenheim over the Ahr river and one in Mühlen in Taufers over the Mühlwalder brook. The train stations coming from Bruneck to Taufers were St. Georgen, Gais, Uttenheim, Mühlen in Taufers, Kematen and Taufers. History The railroad was built by the Tirolean railway engineer Josef Riehl and from 1907 onwards 300 people were working on the construction site. The needed 800 Volt direct current for the train was produced by a small power plant in the valley using the water of the Ahr River. Until World War I the service was provided by the Austrian Südbahngesellschaft, which also ran the Brennerbahn and the Pusterer Bahn. The cars had two motors with each 48 Kilowatt power. Because the line had only one track from one end to the other only one train could drive back and forward. Six trains daily got from Bruneck to Taufers and vice versa in 50 minutes. Like many other secondary train lines the service today is made by buses. Today Today the track is part of the South Tyrolean bike trail network, no signs of the old railway are visible.

It has received a positive review by Beryl Bainbridge.  Plot summary  Written as a travelogue, Coasting describes Jonathan Raban's single-handed 4,000 mile voyage around Britain which he made in 1982 (at the age of 40) in an old restored 32-foot sea-going ketch, the Gosfield Maid. Raban sailed with a chart and a hand bearing- compass; he sailed by the look of the coastline. His story takes various digressions, just as his journey does, as he mulls over his childhood as the son of a vicar in the Church of England, and the current state of Britain under Margaret Thatcher during the time of the Falklands War. Chapter Two is a description of the dogged insularity of the Manx, who he compares to the Falkland Islanders, whilst the Isle of Man becomes a metaphor for the insularity of the larger island on which he himself had been brought up and lived up till this point. Raban himself has commented on his own attitude to England and the influence of Margaret Thatcher on Britain at the time of writing his book. The British he sees as being famous for their insular arrogance and condescension. As he describes them: 'They love fine social distinctions and divisions and are snobbishly wedded to an antique system of caste and class ... They are aggressively practical and philistine, with a loud contempt for anything that smells abstract or theoretical. They are a nation of moneygrubbers and bargain-hunters, treasuring pennies for treasuring's sake...When it comes to sex, they are furtive and hypocritical - and their erotic tastes are known to be extremely peculiar. Many Englishmen will pay a woman to take their trousers down and spank them...For the most part, though, the English, both men and women, are afflicted by such a morbid decay of their libido that it has always puzzled the rest of the world how the English manage to reproduce themselves at all.' The author is equally bitter about the dominant, hectoring Mrs Thatcher. Whilst comfortably moored up in the Gosfield Maid on a beautiful stretch of the River Yealm, he tunes into the House of Commons debate on the Falklands invasion. The Prime Minister talks about sovereign territory being invaded by a foreign power, but to Raban '...her cross, nanny's voice made it sound as if there had been ructions in the nursery and the children were going to be sent to bed without any tea.' He considers equally absurd the majority of MPs who are baying for Argentinian blood. Raban turns his radio off in disgust, '...sick of the sound of growning men baying like a wolf pack. It wasn't a debate, it was a verbal bloodletting, with words standing for the guns and bayonets that would come later when the fleet reached the islands.' and adds, 'Listening to it, I felt that I'd been eavesdropping on the nastier workings of the national subconscious; I'd overheard Britain talking in a dream, and what it was saying scared me stiff.' And it is his negative feelings towards an increasingly alien Britain under the dominance of Thatcher that finally persuade him to make the decision to leave his homeland, although the paradox is that they share a like-minded attitude towards its rigid social hierarchy: The book is remarkable for its penetrating and highly perceptive insights into the character and state of the British nation at the time of writing. One also has to greatly admire him for taking on the challenge of a single-handed voyage around the British Isles, a feat that requires great personal courage on the part of the sailor. For most of the book, Raban, rather like Joyce, is able to form an objectively detached view of his country whilst out at sea on board his boat. However, rather than taking the battering ram approach of his eccentric predecessors (men like Middleton, McMullen, and Hilaire Belloc), he uses beautifully crafted language to describe the life of a single-handed sailor in great awe of the sea, with detailed almost lyrical descriptions of the characters he encounters along the way. Two passages that particularly stand out are of Raban's rather hostile meeting with Paul Theroux at Brighton Marina, himself in the midst of researching a similar book about Britain, and a much friendlier one with Philip Larkin at Hull, a city Raban knows well from his student days while working as a part-time minicab driver. Criticism Probably one of the best descriptions in the book is of the author's life as a child growing up in assorted Church of England vicarages, in a kind of social no-man's land, unable to mix with the council estate children opposite because they are socially inferior but also out of place in upper class society since a vicar's stipend was about £700 a year, equal to that of a skilled labourer living on a council estate. Raban sums his family's situation up in his own clinically detached manner: 'We belonged nowhere, We had the money of one lot, the voices of another - and we had an unearthly goodliness which removed us from the social map altogether.'

Being heavily wooded, it was an ideal place to buy land to which to escape on the weekends. Quarter-acre plots were available, including building plans and materials, for $500. Four standard plans were used to build quaint, one-bedroom dwellings. An original, unaltered house may be seen on the northeastern corner of Edgemoor Place and Sunnymere Avenue. Many Millsmont homes have panoramic views to Alameda and the San Francisco Peninsula to the west and the Oakland hills to the east. After the earthquake of 1906, many individuals who had been left homeless and penniless settled in their small properties in the Millsmont neighborhood.

Built in 1975 by the JTC Corporation and designed by Prof. Yuen-chen Yu, an architect from Taiwan, the Chinese Garden’s concept is based on Chinese gardening art. The main characteristic is the integration of architectural features with the natural environment. The Chinese Garden is modeled along the northern Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping. It is located next to Chinese Garden MRT station and connected to the adjacent Japanese Garden by a bridge. Along with Japanese Garden, the two gardens are collectively known as the Jurong Gardens.  Features   Stone Lions  A pair of cloudy-grained marble stone lions at the main gates of the Chinese Garden, guarding the main gates of the Garden. The marble stone used to sculpt the lions was imported from Taiwan.  Bridge  White Rainbow Bridge, connecting the main entrance with the rest of garden. Bridge of Double Beauty, connecting the Chinese Garden with the Japanese Garden. The 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge (, Bái hóngqiáo) at the Garden follows the style of the Seventeen-Arch Bridge at the Summer Palace in Peking. In 1989 a second bridge, the Bridge of Double Beauty, was built, to connect the Chinese with the Japanese Garden.  Main Arch Building  The Main Arch Building is a standard Chinese arch building. This building is popular for picture-taking. Inside the main arch building, there are two courtyards, namely the “Early Spring Courtyard” and “Garden Courtyard”. Also, there is a fishpond in the centre which is named the “Fishes Paradise”.  Stone Boat and Tea House  A famous traditional feature of Chinese architecture is the Stone Boat structure. Its design and architectural beauty are considered to be a fine art that has been praised by people throughout the world. The style of Yao-Yueh Fang (the Stone Boat) in the Chinese Garden is based on the Peking style, but with some adaptations in the design and usage of materials. The Ming Hsiang Hsieh (Tea House) is a miniature structure following the style of the elaborate, winding gallery at the Summer Palace. This meandering design is a characteristic and graceful Chinese architectural feature.  Pagoda  The 7-storey pagoda with some of the Eight Heroes in the foreground. The twin pagodas In ancient times, pagodas, originally simple tower structures located beside temples, were used for the storage of human ashes (in urns) by Buddhists. In later times, pagodas were developed into structures which are considered to possess \\"striking architectural beauty\\". The Ru Yun T'a (7-storey pagoda) is situated on a small hill in the Chinese Garden. Its typical pagoda design follows the style of Linggu Temple Pagoda at Nanjing.  Pavilion, Plateau and Tower  The Chinese Pavilion, Plateau and Tower are considered to be an important part of the Chinese gardening art. The artistic features, typical of Chinese architecture, have long been appreciated by man. The design of the four pavilions at the Chinese Garden is based on the style of Northern Chinese Pavilions, and decorated to blend harmoniously with the Garden.  Bonsai Garden  Bonsai Garden Opened in June 1992, the Suzhou-style Bonsai Garden cost an estimated $3.8 million to build. This 5,800-square-metre garden with Suzhou-style buildings (incorporating a main hall of 50 square metres) and landscape houses a collection of over 2,000 bonsais imported from China and other parts of the world. The Bonsai Garden is considered to be \\"a beauty that must be seen to be believed\\". It is designed as a largest Suzhou-style Bonsai garden of its kind outside of China. A Bonsai Training Centre has been launched. The public are encouraged to sign up for the course, which will be taught by Bonsai experts from Shanghai and Suzhou (China). They will teach how to prune and care for Bonsais and how to appreciate the beauty of this unique artistry.  Garden of Abundance  The newest addition to the Chinese Garden family is the Garden of Abundance. The original name of this garden is the Zodiac & Pomegranate Garden, derived from the elements used for the construction of the garden. It consists of pomegranate trees, the 12 Chinese Zodiac animals sculpture, a sundial, stone bridges and planting of materials. 100-year-old pomegranate trees from Shantung, China have been planted into this new garden. They sit among the 12 Chinese Zodiac Animal sculptures.  Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum  The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, a primary attraction in Chinese Garden, exhibits various species of turtles and tortoises. The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum In 2019, the museum moved out from the gardens and relocated to Yishun; this was due to upgrading works carried out in the surrounding Jurong Lake District.  East Entrance  This entrance was constructed in conjunction with the Chinese Garden MRT station, to ensure easy access for pedestrians visiting the gardens. Upon approaching the garden, there is a Red Bridge that will lead you in. Four stone lions, welcoming the visitors that are entering the garden, \\"guard\\" the entrance.  Renovation  JTC Corporation is planning a year-long \\"redecoration and refurbishment\\" project starting at the end of 2014. The areas to be repaired include the main entrance plaza, the pavilions, the iconic pagodas, the Stone Boat and footpaths. The repair works involve removing wood that has rotted or become infested by termites. These also include patching up spalling concrete and cracked walls, replacing broken and loose roof tiles, stopping water leakage, as well as replacing old electrical wiring, timber footpaths or rusted fittings.

It also isolates the unwanted RF signals from the power source. In addition, LISNs can be used to predict conducted emission for diagnostic and pre-compliance testing. LISN block diagram. This is standard diagram of a typical LISN. Part values for a particular standard (MIL-STD 461E): C1=8μF, R1=5Ω, C2=250nF, R2=1kΩ Image showing a standard LISN with top cover removed Functions of an LISN Stable line impedance The main function of a LISN is to provide a precise impedance to the power input of the EUT, in order to get repeatable measurements of the EUT noise present at the LISN measurement port. This is important because the impedance of the power source and the impedance of the EUT effectively operate as a voltage divider. The impedance of the power source varies, depending on the geometry of the supply wiring behind it. The anticipated inductance of the power line for the intended installation of the EUT also plays a role in identifying the correct type of LISN needed for testing. For example, a connection in a building will often use 50 μH inductor, whereas in automobile measurement standards a 5 μH inductor is used to emulate a shorter typical wire length. Isolation of the power source noise Another important function of a LISN is to prevent the high-frequency noise of the power source from coupling in the system. A LISN functions as a low-pass filter, which provides high impedance to the outside RF noise while allowing the low-frequency power to flow through to the EUT. Safe connection of the measuring equipment Typically, a spectrum analyzer or an EMI receiver is used to take the measurements during an EMC test. The input port of such an equipment is very sensitive and prone to damage if overloaded. A LISN provides a measurement port with, usually, 50 Ω output impedance. The stabilized impedance, the built-in low-pass filter function, and the DC rejection properties of the LISN measurement port makes it easy to couple the high frequency noise signal to the input of the measuring equipment. LISN types Under a particular EMC test standard, a specific LISN type is required for evaluating and characterizing the operation of the EUT. Different types of LISNs are available for analyzing DC, single- phase or 3-phase AC power connections. The main parameters for selecting the proper type of LISN are impedance, insertion loss, voltage rating, current rating, number of power conductors and connector types. The upper frequency limit of the LISN also plays an important role when conducted emissions measurements are used for predicting radiated emissions problems. A 100 MHz LISN is used in those cases.

Foster sang second lead alongside two other gospel greats, Rebert Harris and Sam Cooke. Foster possessed a powerful, mournful tenor voice, a perfect foil to both Harris' and Cooke's sweeter more-flowery tenor styles. During his long career in gospel music, Foster also sang for other quartets such as the Rising Stars and the Golden Echoes. While nearly all of Foster's recordings take place in the recording studio, his powerful voice can be heard on the Soul Stirrers' dynamic performance on the album \\"The Great Shrine Concert of 1955\\", especially on the song \\"Be With Me Jesus\\", where Foster leads the group with his strong testimonial style. __TOC__  Background  Paul Foster was born on July 12, 1920 in Grand Cane, Louisiana to Thomas and Lillie Williams Foster. As a young child, he sang in the family group ('The Fosters', which consisted of Paul and his six sisters: Jannie Mae, Hattie Mae, Ola Mae, Anna Mae, Midloise, and Patrice). Paul had one brother, Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Foster. When he was 16 he joined the 'Hurricane Bluff Spiritual Gospel Singers'.  Early career  During the Second World War he served in the army at Fort Ord, California. and afterwards moved to Oakland, California. He brought his family: wife, Mary and children, Esther, Mary, Paul, Jr., Thomas and Barbara Ann to live with him. Here he joined and recorded with the 'Rising Stars'. Foster also sang with 'The Paramounts' and the 'Golden Harps'. After the death of his father in 1948 he joined 'Golden Echoes'. With this group he recorded for Specialty Recordings, for which he would later record with the Soul Stirrers. After only a few months he joined the 'Houston All-Stars'.  Soul Stirrers  When he performed with the Houstonaires (or Houston All-stars, the sources are different) in late 1949 he was spotted by the Soul Stirrers who also sang during that show. A few weeks later he was asked to replace James Medlock and Foster joined the Soul Stirrers, just after his father had died. When RH Harris left the group Foster did all the leads for two months but that was too much, up to the point of him getting migraines. That's when Sam Cooke stepped in to lighten the load. He again was the only lead singer for a few months when Johnnie Taylor left the group. Foster would stay with the Soul Stirrers until 1963.  Later career  He then moved to Los Angeles to start a barbecue restaurant and sang with groups like the 'Sims Brothers' and the 'Los Angeles Golden Crowns'. But not for long. In 1965 he would become Reverend Foster, which was in line with his great religiosity. He became the pastor of the Union Baptist Church in Vallejo where he stayed until he retired in the early eighties. It was here that he died on August 20, 1995. He is interred in his hometown of Grand Cane, Louisiana in the Friendship Baptist Church cemetery.

Formerly placed in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae, it is now separated with some other \\"odd flycatchers\\" as the new family Stenostiridae (Beresford et al. 2005, Fuchs et al. 2006). It is the only member of the genus Stenostira. It is an endemic resident breeder in southern Africa in Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia, and a vagrant to Zimbabwe and Swaziland. Stenostira scita is a common seasonal migrant, breeding in karoo scrub and fynbos in the southern highlands, and migrating north in to spend the southern winter in thorn scrub at lower altitudes. Description The fairy flycatcher is 11–12 cm in length. The adult is pale grey above with a black mask through the eye and a white supercilium. The wings are black with a long white stripe, and the long black tail has white sides. The throat is white, the breast is pale grey, and the belly is white with a pinkish-grey wash to its centre. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile is browner than the adult. The eye is brown and the bill and legs are black. Behaviour The fairy flycatcher is monogamous unless its mate dies, when it will seek a new partner. It builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in the branches of a tree or shrub but well concealed. The female lays two or three green eggs. This bird is usually seen alone, in pairs, or small flocks. It feeds on small insects and other invertebrates, foraging in the foliage like a warbler. References * Supporting information * del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D. (editors). (2006).

It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to glucose-1-phosphate, yielding 3-phosphoglycerate and glucose-1,6-bisphosphate. (image courtesy of the BRENDA enzyme database) The enzyme requires a divalent metal ion cofactor. Zinc (Zn2+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Manganese (Mn2+), Calcium (Ca2+), Nickel (Ni2+), Copper (Cu2+), Cadmium (Cd2+) are all proven effective cofactors in vitro. Additionally, the enzyme appears to function optimally in a pH range from 7.3–8.7 and at a temperature of 25 °C. Metabolic significance of the catalyzed reaction The main product, glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, appears to have several functions: 1\\\\. Inhibition of hexokinase, an enzyme used in the first step of glycolysis. 2\\\\. Activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and pyruvate kinase, both of which are enzymes involved in activation of the glycolytic pathway. 3\\\\. It acts as a coenzyme for phosphoglucomutase in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. 4\\\\. It acts as a cofactor for phosphopentomutase, which produces D-ribose-5-phosphate. 5\\\\. acts as a phosphate donor molecule for unknown nonmetabolic effector proteins. 6\\\\. It increases in concentration during skeletal muscle contraction. 7\\\\. Its dephosphorylation yields glucose-6-phosphate, which is an important precursor molecule in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate is most likely used in correlation with gluconeolysis. The product’s inhibition of hexokinase and activation of PFK-1 and pyruvate kinase is indicative of its role in glycolysis. Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate inhibit hexokinase stopping the production glucose-6-phosphate from D-glucose. Its activation of PFK-1 and pyruvate kinase shows that glycolysis still continues without the production of glucose-6-phosphate from D-glucose. This means that the glucose-6-phosphate needed for glycolysis most likely comes from gluconeolysis. The reactant glucose-1-phosphate is produced by gluconeolysis. This reactant can also form D-glucose-6-phosphate, which is needed for glycolysis. It can therefore be inferred that it is possible when glucose-1-phosphate is produced, it makes glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (with glucose-1,6-bisophosphate synthase) and glucose-6-phosphate. The glucose-1,6-bisphosphate increase the activity of glycolysis, of which glucose-6-phosphate is a reagent. In addition, one of the reactants (1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) and one of the products (3-phosphoglycerate) are intermediates in the 'payoff' phase of glycolysis. In other words, two molecules involved with glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase are able to be both created and recycled in the glycolytic pathway. The reactant glucose 1-phosphate is an important precursor molecule in many different pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Regulation of the enzyme Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase is allosterically inhibited by inorganic phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate (a product), citrate, lithium, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and acetyl CoA. The inhibition of the enzyme by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is most likely a feedback inhibition due to the product of the enzyme (glucose-1,6-bisphosphate) activation of PFK-1 (the enzyme which produces fructose-1,6-bisphosphate). When too much fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is produced, it inhibited the production of more PFK-1 activator. The enzyme is also inhibited by PEP, which is a reagent of pyruvate kinase. The product of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase (glucose-1,6-bisphosphate) activates pyruvate kinase. Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase appears to be activated by the presence of one of its substrates: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate). Enzyme structure No structure determination of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase has been documented to date. Nevertheless, studies have shown that its structure appears to be markedly similar to a related enzyme called phosphoglucomutase. Both enzymes contain serine linked phosphates in their active sites, both have the same molecular weights, and both require a metal ion cofactor. Perhaps most importantly, both enzymes produce glucose-1,6-bisphosphate as either a product or an intermediate.

The Congress Hall. Documentation Centre from the lake The Documentation Center Nazi Party Rallying Grounds (German: Dokumentationszentrum Reichsparteitagsgelände) is a museum in Nuremberg. It is in the north wing of the unfinished remains of the Congress Hall of the former Nazi party rallies. Its permanent exhibition \\"Fascination and Terror\\" is concerned with the causes, connections, and consequences of Nazi Germany. Topics that have a direct reference to Nuremberg are especially taken into account. Attached to the museum is an education forum.  Architecture  In 1994 the city council of Nuremberg decided to establish the Documentation Center. Austrian architect Günther Domenig designed the museum, winning the 1998 international competition with his proposal to spear through the northern head of the building with a diagonal glass and steel passageway. Inherent in the gesture of this project is a pun on the name and a refutation of the chief Nazi architect Albert Speer who had directed a masterplan for this site including a Zeppelin Field, a stadium to hold 400,000, a March Field for military exercises, a Congress Hall for 50,000, and a wide Great Road.Jan Otakar Fischer, Full Disclosure: Invoking the Past in Recent German Exhibition Design. Harvard Design Magazine, Number 19, Fall 2003/Winter 2004. This is where Speer had created the \\"cathedral of light\\" and where the Nazis drew nearly a million people in rallies between 1933 and 1938. These were captured on film by Leni Riefenstahl in Triumph of the Will. Domenig, the son of a Nazi judge, confronted his own personal history in addition to the history and Nazi architecture of the project's site.Steven Erlanger, Nuremberg Journal; The Architect Who Speared His Own Nazi Demon. New York Times, November 8, 2001. On 4 November 2001 the project was unveiled by Johannes Rau, then President of Germany.  Exhibition  The permanent exhibition \\"Fascination and Terror\\" (Faszination und Gewalt) studies the causes, coherence, and consequences of National Socialism. It describes the Nazi Party Rallies and explains the fascination they exercised upon participants and visitors. At the same time, the exhibition endeavors to explain what led to the National Socialists' criminal exercise of power and to reveal how the various causal factors were interrelated. A further goal is a frank presentation of the violent consequences that ensued for the population. The events that are inseparably linked with Nuremberg (\\"city of the party rally\\" — Stadt der Reichsparteitage) and the National Socialist period are also explained: the activities of Julius Streicher, editor of the anti-Semitic rabble-rousing weekly Der Stürmer (The Storm Trooper), the history of the Nuremberg Rally, the proclamation of the so-called Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the buildings of the Nazi party rally grounds and the trouble with Nazi architecture after 1945, and the criminal Nuremberg Trials against the chief executives of the National Socialist agenda in 1945-1946 and twelve succeeding trials. The exhibition concludes with an examination of the problem that has been with Germany since 1945: how Germans should deal with the legacy in stone left at the Party Rally Grounds by the National Socialists. The exhibition is structured in chronological order. The individual exhibition rooms vary in size and structure. They range from corridors of just a few square meters in size to large halls. The exhibition area offers a total of 1,300 square meters of floor space. The exhibition is presented in narrative form. Use is made of classical exhibition methods as well as of modern forms of presentation. Five films newly created for the Documentation Center are essential elements on the route through the exhibition. Easy-to-use electronic display stations on various topics offer a wealth of informative pictorial material. Eyewitness interviews which were especially filmed are aimed at making history much more amenable, particularly for the younger generation. A wearable \\"Audioguide\\" leads visitors through the exhibition in English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Polish.  Education forum  The attached education forum is in the glazed cube on the roof of the congress hall. A union of seven Nuremberg educational institutions under the management of the museen der stadt nürnberg makes possible an extensive and target group oriented program. The offer extends from 45 minute exhibition tours to several day seminars aimed at school classes for both youth and adult groups.

Straße der Menschenrechte von NW (17. Oktober 2003) The Way of Human Rights () is a monumental outdoor sculpture in Nuremberg, Germany. It was opened on 24 October 1993. It is sited on the street between the new and old buildings of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, connecting Kornmarkt street and the medieval city wall. In 1988, a twelve- person jury from the Germanisches Nationalmuseum held a design competition to decide on the artistic design of the Kartäusergasse street in Nuremberg. The winner was a proposal by Israeli artist Dani Karavan consisting of a gate, 27 round pillars made of white concrete, two pillars buried in the ground showing only a round plate, and one columnar oak, for a total of 30 pillars. Engraved in each pillar is one article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in German and another language.The inscriptions as summarized by Karavan on the columns http://www.humanrightsanimationproject.org/english/html/human_rights.html accessed 1 May 2007. The pillars are 8 metres in height, 80 cm in diameter, and spaced regularly at 5 metres along an axis.Information about the project from http://www.danikaravan.com/ accessed 1 May 2007. The north gate mirrors the medieval city gate located at the south end of the street. The site of project has a layered history, including the remnants of a monastery, the medieval city wall, buildings designed by Sep Ruf in the 1950s and 1960s, and a glass-enclosed entrance designed by the firm ME DI UM in 1993.http://www.gnm.de/architektur.html accessed 4 May 2007. This sculpture is part of Nuremberg's efforts to shake off its Nazi-era reputation as the \\"City of the Party Rallies\\" and reinvent itself as a \\"City of Peace and Human Rights\\". In 2001, Nuremberg was honored for this attempt at transformation with the UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education,Award ceremony address by Koïchiro Matsuura http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001224/122419E.pdf 21 April 2001. the Way of Human Rights being specifically cited.

Widely distributed in southern Australia, the fungus is responsible for a disease known as Armillaria root rot, a primary cause of Eucalyptus tree death and forest dieback. It is the most pathogenic and widespread of the six Armillaria species found in Australia. The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile. Fruit bodies have cream- to tan-coloured caps that grow up to in diameter and stems that measure up to long by thick. The fruit bodies, which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn (March–April), are edible, but require cooking to remove the bitter taste. The fungus is dispersed through spores produced on gills on the underside of the caps, and also by growing vegetatively through the root systems of host trees. The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse oxygen through rhizomorphs—rootlike structures made of dense masses of hyphae. Armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978, after having been discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees to show signs of disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A. luteobubalina is closely related to A. montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A. paulensis. The distribution of A. luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.  History and phylogeny  Armillaria luteobubalina was first described in 1978 by mycologists Roy Watling and Glen Kile, who studied its effects on a fast-growing plantation of Eucalyptus regnans near Traralgon, Victoria. The plantation, established in 1963, consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about . A cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary pathogen, that is, one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other, secondary pathogens. This finding was inconsistent with the pathogenic behaviour of the known Armillaria species in Australia at the time, A. mellea and A. elegans. Further study over the next few years showed that the fungus spread by the growth of underground mycelia in root systems, expanding outward from the initial infected stump at an average of per year. Most Australian records of Armillaria infections referred to A. mellea, based on the presence of black rhizomorphs. For over one hundred years, A. mellea was thought to be a pleiomorphic (occurring in various distinct forms) species with a widespread distribution and host range, and variable pathogenicity. which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike. In 1973, Veikko Hintikka reported a technique to distinguish between Armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures. Using similar techniques, mycologists eventually determined that the Armillaria mellea species complex in Europe and North America in fact consisted of five and ten distinct \\"biological species\\", respectively. Watling and Kile compared the macroscopic and microscopic characters of the pathogenic Armillaria with A. polymyces (now known as A. obscura), A. mellea, A. limonea and A. novae-zelandiae and found sufficient differences between them to warrant designating the species as new. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin lutea \\"yellow\\", and was chosen to highlight an important distinguishing characteristic: the strong yellow colour of the cap and lack of reddish or brown tones in the stem typical of other resident Armillaria. A phylogenetic study of South American Armillaria species concluded that A. luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A. montagnei, and these are sister to a lineage containing A. paulensis, a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo, Brazil. Although they are very similar, specimens of A. luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of A. montagnei, and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of pectic enzymes, A. luteobubalina is closely related to A. limonea, a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A. luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.  Description  Mushroom caps are covered with tiny scales and have an umbo. Up to in diameter, the cap is convex to flattened in shape with a central umbo (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded gills are sinuate and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins. The stem is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to long by thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like ring which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The flesh is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency. Although it has a hot-bitter taste, Armillaria luteobubalina is edible, and cooking removes the bitterness.  Microscopic characteristics  The spore print is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), non-amyloid (meaning they do not absorb iodine from Melzer's reagent), and typically measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack clamp connections at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with sterigmata (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4 μm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia that occur on the edge of a gill) are mostly club- shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10 μm.  Similar species  Five other Armillaria species are found in Australia. Within the range of A. luteobubalina, A. hinnulea is restricted to gully habitats. A. fumosa is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations. A. luteobubalina and A. montagnei share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5–11 by 5.5–7 µm compared to 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5 µm) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in A. luteobubalina. The morphology of the vegetative structures of A. limonea is distinctly different than A. luteobubalina, and can be used to distinguish the two species. A. novae- zelandiae has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and A. pallidula is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees. A. luteobubalina is the only Armillaria species which occurs in Western Australia. Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because A. luteobubalina is more pathogenic than the other members of the genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using DNA extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of A. luteobubalina that suggested sexual reproduction.  Habitat and distribution  A. luteobubalina grows in Karri forests, like this one in Pemberton, Western Australia. Armillaria luteobubalina has been recorded in southeastern Australia, from the southeastern corner of Queensland through eastern New South Wales and across Victoria into southeastern South Australia. It also occurs in Tasmania and southwestern Western Australia. Those of the karri forests (consisting largely of the species E. diversicolor) of the southwest have paler and yellower caps than those in the jarrah forests (which contain predominantly Eucalyptus marginata) further north. The fruit bodies arise on wood, especially on stumps or around the base of trees, and often in huge numbers. They usually appear between April and July, although most production occurs in the second half of May. Abundant in woodlands, it can invade gardens and orchards, where it can attack many woody plants. The honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) which had been cut down near Kings Park in suburban Perth. Armillaria luteobubalina is commonly found in eucalyptus forests in Australia, and is thought to be the most pathogenic and most widespread Armillaria species in the major western Australian forest types. The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America, in Argentina and Chile. A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that A. luteobubalina is an ancient species, originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana. Genetic differences between isolates in the South American and Australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation, and the authors suggest that they \\"later might be regarded as independent taxa\\".  Root rot  Young fruit body found in Wielangta forest in southeastern Tasmania, Australia  Appearance of infected trees  Trees that are infected by A. luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both above and below ground. Above the ground, the base of the tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes white rot, a fungal wood decay process where the cellulose and lignin of the sapwood are both broken down, leaving the wood stringy. The bark of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear at the base of the tree in autumn. Crowns may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted sapwood, and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.  Occurrence  In selectively logged eucalypt forests in the central highlands of Victoria, it has been estimated that about 3–5% of the forest area is \\"moderately to severely affected\\" by Armillaria root rot caused by A. luteobubalina. A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by A. luteobubalina was rare, and only accounted for 1% of mortality in total. In this instance, the cases had been restricted to Eucalyptus nitens on the Dorrigo Plateau. Unlike other Armillaria species found in Australia's native forests, which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species, A. luteobubalina is a primary pathogen, and can infect healthy trees. Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above-ground symptoms, making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand. Surveys are usually conducted in autumn, to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees, and the appearance of fruit bodies. Several factors, however—such as cost, variable on-site conditions, and non- symptomatic diseased trees—make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections. One study showed that above-ground examinations detected only 50% of the trees actually infected, leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20–40%. The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30-year-old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40–45% incidence of infection.  Disease spread  A dense cluster of fruit bodies growing on a rotting stump Several studies have shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands,A forest stand may be defined as: \\"A group of trees occupying a given area and sufficiently uniform in species composition, age, structure, site quality, and condition so as to be distinguishable from the forest on adjoining areas.\\" From fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E. calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile. Armillaria luteobubalina uses \\"an elaborate, sophisticated aeration system\\" that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called \\"air-pores\\" near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A. luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.  Control  Methods for controlling the spread of Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A. luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A. luteobubalina and one of the saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A. luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A. luteobubalina on the stump base.

He initially started programming games on the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1981 and 1987,Andrew Glaister at World of Spectrum forming a company called Programmers Development Systems Ltd. Andrew then worked as a developer for Viacom New Media, Kinesoft Development and FASA Interactive in the United States. When Microsoft Game Studios acquired FASA in 1999, Andrew continued to work for them as a Development Manager, in later years particularly for the Windows Graphics and Gaming team working on Direct X 10, display drivers and other features for Windows Vista.Andrew Glaister at MobyGames Work history Andrew first started playing with electronics at age 10, and had built his first computer at age 12.Andy Glaister's Work History at his personal website This was a simple design based on the SC/MP 8060, in a wooden box with 8 LEDs, 8 input switches and 32 bytes of RAM from 4 74LS89 16x4 chips. Sinclair projects In 1980 he acquired his first 'real' computer, a Microtan 65, and spent time using his friend's ZX80. In 1981 his parents purchased a ZX81 for Andrew, and within months he began selling his own games. This was done at first through one of the first computer stores in England–the Buffer Micro Shop in Streatham. Duplication was performed on C15 cassette tapes after school, with photocopied inserts. He managed four or five duplications a night, selling each for ten pounds. Andrew would then go by train from Crawley to Streatham and return with his profits. After meeting an employee from Silversoft in the shop one day, Andrew decided to let that company publish the games instead. 1982 saw the release of the ZX Spectrum. Glaister's first program for Silversoft was the video game Orbiter, which sold 30,000 copies over Christmas. He started working with Softek (later EDGE Games), writing a number of games such as Ostron. Using the money from those games, Andrew purchased an Osborne 1 and started to use Z80 assemblers to try to produce code for the Spectrum. He also used the built-in 300 baud modem to play (with friends Jez San and Fouad Katan) a new game called MUD - Multi User Dungeon, remotely logging into Essex University. Andrew is credited for becoming the second external 'Wizard' in the game (Jez San of Argonaut Games being the first.)] In the late 80s, he worked on the development of an early IBM PC clone, the Apricot PC. It was sold under the name Programmers Development Systems Ltd., a company founded with Jacqui Lyons and Fouad Katan. Due to the Apricot's programming tools and connectivity with home computers like the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, it became popular with many developers, such as Richard Aplin and the Oliver twins. During this time he was writing both Spectrum ports (of Konami games Jail Break and Salamander for example) and original games (Empire!). In 1989 Andrew moved to Vancouver after joining Mission Electronics as their lead firmware engineer, to help develop the first MCA laptop. In 1992 he joined Icom simulations in Illinois, working on the official development system for the TurboGrafx-16. Windows projects In 1994 Icom Simulations was acquired by Viacom New Media. Andrew was retained and he worked on several projects such as Beyond Shadowgate and art and programming tools for many console games. During this time Andrew met Peter Sills and Mark Achler. Together they worked on converting console games to Windows as Kinesoft Development. Their conversion of Pitfall, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure, was published in time for the launch of Windows 95. This game was then used by Bill Gates at the E3 prior to the Windows 95 launch to show off the 'Direct X Gaming Technologies' in Windows, even though Pitfall contained no DirectX technology. These conversions led to a Windows 95 'gaming shell' called Exodus Technologies and other emulation technology. Kinesoft was approached by a number of companies to buy or license the technology, eventually signing a deal with GameBank, a company set up by SoftBank and Microsoft to bring console titles to Windows. Kinesoft, expanding, had 30 employees at its peak, and Andrew was now developing as part of a full team rather than a sole programmer.

Little research has been done on the Garachi, and most of what is known about them is based on the works of the 19th-century Russian scholars Kerope Patkanov and Jean-Marie Chopin. The term Garachi is sometimes used to describe the Domari-speaking people of northern Iran, who were previously thought to be of Romani stock. The confusion is explained by the fact that both groups live in the regions populated mostly by Azeri- speakers who apply the word Garachi to all medieval collective migrants from the Indian subcontinent, including the Dom. For information on the Dom of Iran, see the article under Dom people. Origins and history Even though the Garachi of Azerbaijan call themselves Dom (the name Garachi was given to them by the local population and derives from the Azeri word qara - \\"black\\" and the suffix -çı denoting the stem-word's function/occupation), they do not seem to share same origins with the Dom people. According to Jean-Marie Chopin, the Azerbaijani Garachi descend from the medieval Romani nomads of Central Asia.Chopin, Jean-Marie. New Articles on the Ancient History of the Caucasus and Its Inhabitants. St Petersburg, 1896 In 1944, Vasily Yan suggested that the Garachi of Azerbaijan and the Dom of Iran (sometimes referred to as the Garachi) differ in terms of their origins. Turkestan Campaigns by Vasily Yan In 1887, Kerope Patkanov stated that the Garachi of the South Caucasus (then part of the Russian Empire) numbered 2,399 people living mostly in the Goychay uyezd (present-day Goychay, Ujar, Agsu, and Ismayilli rayons of Azerbaijan) and Nakhichevan. The largest Garachi settlement was named after them and is situated around 4 km southeast of Khacmaz town in Khachmaz region.Patkanov, Kerope. Gypsies: Several Words on the Dialects of the Transcaucasian Gypsies, the Bosha and the Karachi. St. Petersburg, 1887 Their main occupation was the production of household items such as baskets, sieves and chewing gum made by men and sold by women in the neighbouring towns. Among other sources of income Patkanov lists fortune- telling and cattle larceny. Nomadic Garachi groups used to train animals and make street song-and-dance performances. Gypsies and Crime by Oleg Kucheriavy This practice was described in the famous 1913 story Garaja giz by the Azeri writer Suleyman Sani Akhundov. Qaraca Qiz by Suleyman Sani Akhundov (full text) The Garachi claim to adhere to Shia Islam but in reality are non- religious for the most part. Language Patkanov's analysis of the language of the Garachi (based on 101 common phrases) indicated that despite being Indo-Aryan, it is not mutually intelligible with any of the Romani or Domari dialects of the Balkans, Russia, or the Middle East. In addition to it, the Garachi observed by Patkanov spoke Azeri and sometimes Tat as a second and third language respectively. Here are four phrases in Garachi and Romani languages with translation. { cellpadding=6 ! Garachi ! Romani !

He is most known for his famous Black Heath coal mines in Chesterfield County, Virginia. He was involved in this business from the late 1790s to his death. Family and Early Life The early years of Henry (more commonly Harry, the name he was known by and how he signed his correspondence) Heth are shrouded in mystery. He was most likely born in the British Colony of Virginia around 1759 to 1772. There are many tales of how Harry Heth's early life, and by combining all of them one can arrive at a fairly accurate report. One source says that Henry Heth came to Virginia from England in 1759 along with his brothers, William and John, and all three became charter members of the Society of the Cincinnati. Additionally, it states that Henry served in the American Revolutionary War and had a son, Henry, who served in the War of 1812. This subsequent Henry had a son named John. This source was written one hundred years after these men lived and was from information received from Stockton Heth, son of John Heth and grandson of Harry Heth. Another reference states \\"that John HethThe writer has made a mistake or their records are incorrect. This should say Henry Heth. emigrated from the North of Ireland in the earlier half of the eighteenth century\\" and \\"settled first in Pennsylvania not far from Pittsburgh\\". There are bits of truth in both of these documents and yet neither tell the full story. Most of the story can be found in a history of the Heth family published in 1934. According to this history, Harry Heth was the son of a man named Henry Heth who was born in Ireland on November 16, 1718. Furthermore, Henry apparently \\"came to the colonies from Newgate Prison as an indentured servant\\".This is found in: https://www.ancestry.com/boards/surnames.heth/3.8.9/mb.ashx How he ended up in Newgate Prison in London from Ireland is uncertain. Later, after he had immigrated to the New World, Henry Heth married Agnes McMachan around 1749 in Frederick County, Virginia. AgnesThere are various spellings of this last name. They include: McMachan, McMahon, Mackey. was from a family living in Frederick County. According to various record, he seems to have acquired land near Fort Pitt (modern day Pittsburgh) and when the Revolutionary War broke out, he was a captain of an independent company stationed near Fort Pitt. In his will, dated March 30, 1793, Henry names his six sons: William, Andrew, John, Henry, Hervy, and Richard.This is the numbering of how they appear on the document. It may or may not be related to their ages. A transcribed copy of Henry's will can be found at https://mediasvc.ancestry.com/v2/image/namespaces/60623/media/00000841-1002-0000-0000-000000000000.jpg?client=Boards He names none of his daughters, but he does name Gabriel Peterson (his son-in- law) as a witness and executor. Henry also indicates that some of his children are minors, so at least two children were born in or after 1772. A 1797 land document gives the birth order of Henry's sons living at that time: William, John, Harvey, Henry, and Richard.The document is found here: https://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db;=adgedge&id;=I71634 It appears that Andrew has died. Henry is also listed as having six daughters, among them Mary (wife of Capt. Robert Porterfield) and Anne or Nancy (wife of Lieut., later Col. Josiah Tannehill). Henry and his sons served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and received numerous land grants for their service. American Revolutionary War Henry \\"Harry\\" Heth may have served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. His service is obscured by several points. First, his father was named Henry and also served in the army. This senior Heth was the captain of an independent company stationed near Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania. Second, there was another Henry Heth who served as a quartermaster for a Virginia regiment during the war. Lastly, Harry may not have been old enough to be a soldier during the Revolutionary War. In a 1782 census of the city of Richmond, he is listed as being 18 years old. Heth married Nancy Hare in 1787 at age 23. Business career Harry Heth's house, Black Heath Regardless of whether he served in the Revolutionary War, it is certain that sometime in the 1780s Heth came to live in the Richmond, Virginia area. In 1795, along with John Stewart, Heth bought a 99.5 acre piece of land upon which the Black Heath coal pits were situated. This was to be the beginning of a 55 year association between the Black Heath pits and the Heth family. Heth began to improve the pits, which until recently had only consisted of shallow pits in the ground, until they were the largest coal pits in the United States. Such was the quality of the coal from Black Heath that President Thomas Jefferson ordered some to be used in heating the White House. Harry Heth maintained offices in Norfolk and Manchester (across the James River at Richmond), where he engaged in the coal business. Heth owned several coal mines in the area now known as Midlothian in northwestern Chesterfield County. Colonel Heth participated in working the Railey family's coal pits and became the owner of the Black Heath coal pits. Colonel Heth owned slaves, and prior to the American Civil War (and emancipation), the mines were largely worked with African Americans, mostly slaves. Manchester, at the head of navigation on the James River, was the closest export port for Heth's coal. Personal life Harry Heth married Nancy Hare (1772-1846) on November 10, 1787 in Richmond.

It was broadcast by ABS-CBN from July 8, 1996 to March 2, 2001. This was her first show after Magandang Umaga Po ended on May 31, 1996. The program was an offshoot of the Balitang K segment of TV Patrol when Sanchez replaced Mel Tiangco after the latter suspended from the network until Noli de Castro became the sole anchor of the newscast in 1997. TV Patrol was reformatted in 1997 because of the success of Mexican telenovela, Marimar aired on RPN surpassing TV Patrol on its timeslot. To beef up the ratings of ABS-CBN, Balitang K was launched as a pre-program to TV Patrol. Balitang K aired after the public service program, Hoy Gising!. In 2001, TV Patrol anchor Noli de Castro ran for a senate seat as Sanchez was appointed as his replacement. Kris Aquino took over the latter's hosting job in the reformatted spin-off, Balitang Kris. However, this new program was cancelled due to low ratings. Kris would resume hosting duties in another talk show, Kris and Tell. The concept of Balitang K was reused for another incarnation, Rated K, also hosted by Sanchez.

Church of Ireland Press release, 4 February 2013. Archdeacons Overview The three dioceses of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh were first created in the early and mid 12th-century. The sees of Elphin and Ardagh were established at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111 and the see of Kilmore (originally called Tirbrunensis, Triburnia or Tybruinensis) at the Synod of Kells in 1152. Following the Reformation in the 16th century, the church in \\"communion with the Bishop of Rome\\" used the term \\"Catholic\\" to distinguish itself from the various Protestant churches.McBrien, Richard (2008). The Church. Harper Collins. p. xvii. Online version available Browseinside.harpercollins.com . Quote: \\"[T]he use of the adjective 'Catholic' as a modifier of 'Church' became divisive only after the East-West Schism ...and the Protestant Reformation ...In the former case, the West claimed for itself the title Catholic Church, while the East appropriated the name Holy Orthodox Church. In the latter case, those in communion with the Bishop of Rome retained the adjective \\"Catholic\\", while the churches that broke with the Papacy were called Protestant.\\" The Parliament of Ireland broke communion when it created the Church of Ireland as the State Religion in the Kingdom of Ireland assuming possession of most Church property.

History A mid Victorian era photograph showing a Colne Valley and Halstead Railway 2-2-2WT at Halstead engine shed. A railway in the Colne Valley was first proposed in 1846 when the Colchester, Stour Valley, Sudbury and Halstead Railway Company was incorporated to build a line from Marks Tey on the Eastern Counties Railway to Sudbury, with a branch to Halstead and a line from Colchester to Hythe. A later extension to Bury St. Edmunds and Clare was also approved, however a shortage of funds resulted in only the Stour Valley Railway to Sudbury and the line to Hythe being built. In 1856, the Colne Valley and Halstead Railway Company was formed by local people to build a branch line from Chappel and Wakes Colne railway station to Halstead. It was authorised on 30 June 1856, and opened on 16 April 1860 between Chappel (north of Marks Tey) and Halstead, a distance of .Railway Magazine December 1958 p. 890 A extension was authorised on 13 August 1859 and opened in stages: * 1 July 1861 Halstead-Castle Hedingham * 26 May 1862 Castle Hedingham-Yeldham * 10 May 1863 Yeldham-Haverhill (CVHR) Physical connection with the Stour Valley Railway at Haverhill was provided in 1865, and although close relations were maintained with the Great Eastern Railway, the Colne Valley and Halstead Railway remained completely independent until it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in the 1923 regrouping. The CVHR station, renamed Haverhill South, was closed to passengers in 1924 but remained open for goods until 1965.  Heritage railway preservation  The line remained open until 30 December 1961, when passenger traffic ended. In 1965, freight traffic ended, and the line was taken up a year later. A mile of track was reconstructed in 1973-75 as the Colne Valley Railway, including Castle Hedingham station. In 2012, the site of the former station was cleared for a pathway, the most likely site for any future extension.

History The early Evangelical Church attached less importance to ecclesiastical ritual than the Catholic Church does. As early as 1526 Martin Luther observes in Deutsche Messe und Ordnung des Gottesdiensts: \\"In sum, this and all other forma are so to be used that where they give rise to a misuse they should be forthwith set aside, and a new form be made ready; since outward forma are intended to serve to the advancement of faith and love, and not to the detriment of faith. Where this they cease to do, they are already dead and void, and are of no more value; just as when a good coin is debased sad retired on account of its abuse, and issued anew; or when everyday shoes wax old and rub, they are not longer worn, but thrown away and new ones bought. Form is an external thing, be it ever so good, and thus it may lapse into misuse; but then it is no longer an orderly form, but a disorder; so that no external order stands and avails at all of itself, as hitherto the papal forma are judged to have done, but all forma have their life, worth, strength, and virtues in proper use; or else they are of no avail and value whatever\\" (Werke, Weimar ed., xix. 72 aqq.). According to Lutheran ecclesiastical teaching (Formula of Concord, II; Solida declaratio, x.; Apology, xiv.; Melanchthon's Loci, 2d redaction in CR, xxi. 555-556; the Saxon Visitationsbuch of 1528; etc.) a uniform liturgy is requisite only in so far as it is indispensable to uphold proper doctrine and the administration of the sacraments; whereas in general the rightful appointment of the external functions of church officers and their sphere in the congregations is committed to the church governing board of the state authorities. The spontaneous development of church law, and especially the regulation of divine service, the sacraments, and discipline, as Luther ideally conceived it, proved impracticable, and gave place, though not invariably so, to definition on the part of temporal sovereigns. All these regulations, especially those of governments and cities, by means of which the canonical church forms that had previously prevailed in the land were modified in a reformatory direction, while the newly developing church system became progressively established, are called \\"Church Orders\\". Those of the sixteenth century are the most important. Format A Church Order usually begins with a dogmatic part in which the agreement of the State Church with the general Lutheran confessions is set forth with more or less of detail (Credenda); then follow regulations concerning liturgy, the appointment of church officers, organization of church government, discipline, marriage, schools, the pay of church and school officials, the administration of church property, care of the poor, etc. (Agenda). A systematic topical arrangement is by no means always adhered to. As a rule, later compilations have made use of earlier forms, and thus the Orders are grouped in families.

He was living in Cusop Dingle, Herefordshire, England and practising in Hay-on-Wye, on the border of England and Wales, from 1906 until his arrest on 31 December 1921 for the attempted murder of a professional rival by arsenic poisoning. He was later also charged with and tried for the murder of his wife. Early life and career Armstrong was born at 23 Princes Square, Plymouth, Devon,Odell, R.; Exhumation Of A Murder. 1975. p8. Birth certificate reproducedd pp10-11. on 13 May 1869 to a family of modest means. The family later moved to Edge Hill, Liverpool. He studied at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, gaining a degree in law, and qualified as a solicitor in February 1895. He later gained an MA from St Catharine's in 1901. Initially practising in Liverpool, later Newton Abbot, he successfully applied for a vacancy in Hay-on-Wye, Breconshire, in 1906. The following year, he married Katharine Mary Friend of West Teignmouth; the couple had two girls, Eleanor and Margaret, and a boy, Pierson. Margaret was the youngest child. The Armstrongs moved into an imposing family home called Mayfield in the village of Cusop Dingle not far from Hay where Armstrong ran his law firm of Cheese & Armstrong. Armstrong was a hard working man and rose in the social community of the town. He was a leading member of the Freemasons and was appointed clerk to the justices. He joined the Volunteer Force and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1914 he was called up in the First World War, where he eventually gained the rank of Major in the Royal Engineers Territorial Force, and served in France, May to October 1918. The award of the Territorial Decoration for long service was published in the London Gazette, 4 November 1919. After the War, he was usually referred to as \\"Major Armstrong\\". Death of Mrs Armstrong In May 1919, Kitty Armstrong's health first began to weaken, with certain symptoms which the local physician, Dr Thomas Hincks, diagnosed as a case of brachial neuritis. From this she appeared to recover, and did not need to consult Dr Hincks for over a year. But in August 1920, Mrs Armstrong's health, both physical and mental, deteriorated again. Armstrong kept in close contact with Hincks, and showed great concern for his wife, consulting relatives and friends as well. Hincks found that Mrs Armstrong was showing signs of mental collapse and came to the conclusion that it was connected to her illness. At the end of August, Mrs Armstrong was admitted to Barnwood, a private mental asylum near Gloucester. On admission she had pyrexia, vomiting, heart murmurs, and albumen in the urine. There was also partial paralysis in the hands and feet and loss of muscle tone. Mrs Armstrong was also delusional. Mrs Armstrong's condition began to improve at Barnwood, and she was discharged home on 22 January 1921. Shortly after her return home her condition mysteriously deteriorated again and she died exactly a month after her return on 22 February 1921. Hincks was puzzled by Mrs Armstrong's symptoms, but nevertheless stated on the death certificate that she had died of gastritis, aggravated by heart disease and nephritis. Outwardly, Armstrong had shown nothing but forbearing concern for his wife, sitting at her bedside reading to her in the evenings, and leaving the office early whenever possible to be with her. If Armstrong did kill his wife, but for a later act of folly he might well have escaped detection. It would seem that there had been at least problems in the marriage. Though authors who have studied the case have assumed that the Armstrong's marriage was a failure due to the domineering attitude of Mrs Armstrong to her husband, the precise nature of the Armstrongs' relationship is far from clear. It was generally held that Mrs Armstrong was a singularly unpleasant woman who regularly abused and humiliated her husband in public, and it was not unnoticed that, though the local newspaper described Mrs Armstrong as a 'popular Hay lady,' few people attended her funeral. On the other hand, Mrs Armstrong, whenever separated from her husband due either to her stays in hospitals or to his service in the War, is reported to have expressed her desire for the family to be reunited at the earliest opportunity. Whatever the truth, service in the First World War had opened up new experiences for the Major and he had had several affairs. He also went to dances in Hay and made passes at local girls. On the day of Mrs Armstrong's death, the servants closed all the curtains as a mark of respect. The first thing that Armstrong did on returning home from the office was to open them again. Attempted murder of Oswald Martin The Clock Tower, Hay- on-Wye Oswald Martin was Armstrong's only rival solicitor in Hay. They were representing opposing parties in a property sale, the Velinewydd estate, which could have ended with Armstrong's client losing and Armstrong having to pay a large sum to Martin's client. The details of the whole transaction remain unclear; Martin subsequently said there was a question about the titles. Perhaps Armstrong's reluctance to pay Martin was due to him having speculated with his client's funds and then losing it. If this was the case, the only thing Armstrong could do was gain time by quietening Martin somehow at least for a while until he could raise the necessary funds by some other means. It would certainly appear that the money entrusted to Armstrong as a deposit on the sale was gone. Martin kept mentioning the matter of completion to Armstrong, but the latter repeatedly delayed and it remained uncompleted by the time of Armstrong's trial. Armstrong eventually invited Martin to a meeting at his home on 26 October 1921. Martin found tea laid out with cakes and buttered scones. Martin probably thought that Armstrong wanted to discuss completion of the property sale, but the two men merely discussed everyday things and office organisation, although Martin could have raised the matter himself. Armstrong spoke of being lonely after the death of his wife. During the meeting over tea, Armstrong picked up a scone, said, \\"excuse fingers\\" and handed it to Martin, who ate it. Having returned home, Martin became violently ill. Martin's father-in-law, John Davies, the chemist (pharmacist) in Hay, had made several sales of arsenic to Armstrong supposedly to kill dandelions despite the fact that it was the autumn and there were only twenty dandelions in the garden of Mayfield, the Armstrongs' home. The chemist was now suspicious of Martin's sudden illness, and when Martin told him he had been to tea at Mayfield, Davies became suspicious. Meanwhile, Hincks became struck by how similar Martin's symptoms were to those of Katharine Armstrong. Hincks, Martin, and Davies discussed the situation and Davies warned the Martins against receiving gifts. Armstrong's offices in Hay-on-Wye in 2014; he was arrested here on 31 December 1921. The building is still used by a firm of solicitors It was subsequently discovered that a few weeks before the tea party, a box of chocolates had been anonymously sent to the Martins. Mrs Martin's sister-in-law had eaten some and become violently ill. Fortunately, some chocolates remained and when examined some were found to have a small nozzle-like hole in the base. Dr Hincks contacted the Home Office and explained his suspicions about what had happened to Martin, and later voicing suspicions about Mrs Armstrong's death. Samples of the chocolates and Martin's urine were examined and found to contain arsenic, and the Home Office now passed the case to Scotland Yard. Meanwhile, Armstrong began to bombard Martin with further invitations to tea, for which Martin found it increasingly difficult to find excuses to avoid. Scotland Yard had to move slowly so as not to warn Armstrong of their suspicions. They eventually arrested him on 31 December 1921, and he was charged with the attempted murder of Oswald Martin. He maintained he was innocent. When he was arrested, the police found a packet of arsenic in his pocket and many more in his house. Mrs Armstrong's body was exhumed and examined by the eminent Home Office pathologist Dr Bernard Spilsbury. Her body was riddled with arsenic ten months after death, and on 19 January 1922, Armstrong was charged with the wilful murder of his wife. \\"I repeat what I said before. I am absolutely innocent,\\" said Armstrong. Trial Armstrong's trial for the murder of his wife began at Hereford before Mr Justice Darling on 3 April 1922. Armstrong was defended by Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, one of the leading criminal trial barristers of the day. Public and media interest was enormous. A year earlier there had been a trial near Hay of another solicitor, Harold Greenwood, for the murder of his wife by poison, supposedly disguised as an illness. Greenwood had been acquitted. Also, the fact that the three men who brought the charges to the police included Armstrong's business rival and the latter's father-in-law looked suspicious to some people. It was believed by some that Armstrong was being framed.Jones, Frank. Beyond Suspicion: True Stories of Unexpected Killers. Toronto: Key Porter Books, c1992. p.53-85 But despite the widespread belief that he would be acquitted, the prosecution case was a strong one. Katherine Armstrong's body was riddled with arsenic and at the time of her death the ingested quantity must have been far higher, and Armstrong had made huge purchases of arsenic. The defence had somehow to make the jury believe that Mrs Armstrong had committed suicide by getting out of bed, going downstairs and helping herself to arsenic without anyone seeing or hearing her; or that massive doses of arsenic had somehow got into her system some accidental way. All witnesses confirmed that towards the end she was almost paralysed. Dr Bernard Spilsbury insisted that the fatal dose must have been taken within twenty-four hours of death, and Hincks affirmed that for Mrs Armstrong to have taken it herself was \\"absolutely impossible\\". Arsenic poisoning Then Armstrong had to explain his habits concerning arsenic or the white powder, arsenic trioxide. He claimed that it was his practice to put small portions of arsenic into individual pouches, which he squirted into the ground near spots where dandelions tended to grow. One small pouch was found on his person following his arrest, and there was no reasonable explanation offered for his carrying it around, particularly as the arrest was in December. Armstrong did not come off well under questioning by Mr Justice Darling concerning this point. Much later, after the trial, two possible motives emerged for Katharine Armstrong's poisoning. Firstly, Armstrong had decided he wanted a different, more congenial wife. Secondly, Katharine had written a will in 1917 leaving the bulk of her estate not to her husband, but to their children. Armstrong produced a new will following his wife's death, giving him control of her estate, but studies suggest that it was probably forged. For some time before the Velinewydd estate affair Armstrong's business had been in financial difficulties. The difficulties in relation to the sale of the Velinewydd estate made things even worse for him. However, the evidence against Armstrong, though considerable, was nonetheless purely circumstantial. No one had actually seen the Major administering poison, and . Mrs Armstrong had occasionally spoken of suicide, some medicines contained arsenic, and there were plenty of other people coming into contact with her at Mayfield. The prosecution failed to show how it was Armstrong and only Armstrong who administered poison, and no one else. As for the Martin poisoning, . In short, other than gaining a little time, the death of Martin would not in any way have relieved the Major's business problems. Armstrong made no confession and adamantly maintained his total innocence to the bitter end. On 13 April 1922 at Hereford Shire Hall, he was found guilty of the murder of his wife. Execution Mr Justice Darling stated that he concurred with the jury's view and that it was absurd and unsupported by any evidence that Mrs Armstrong had committed suicide. He then sentenced Armstrong to death. On 16 May 1922, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed his appeal and Armstrong was hanged by John Ellis at Gloucester Prison on 31 May 1922. Ellis claimed that before the trap was opened on the gallows Armstrong called out, \\"Kitty I'm coomin to ye!\\"Odell (1975) p.225 although this is unconfirmed.Laurence, John. A History of Capital Punishment. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1930. p.131 The News of the World reported that when asked by the prison governor on the morning of the execution if he had anything to say, Armstrong's last words were \\"I am innocent of the crime for which I have been condemned to die.\\" In popular culture The then-recent Armstrong case was discussed in Dorothy L. Sayers's 1927 mystery novel Unnatural Death. In addition, the murderer in Sayers's 1930 novel Strong Poison is caught with packets of arsenic, resembling Armstrong's case. In Detection Unlimited, a 1944 mystery novel written by Georgette Heyer, a character is compared to Armstrong.Heyer, Georgette (2006)(first published 1944), Detection Unlimited, Arrow Books, The Armstrong case was dramatised on the BBC radio series The Black Museum in 1952 under the title of The Champagne Glass. Armstrong was also the subject of a 1994 TV mini-series called Dandelion Dead, which starred Michael Kitchen as Major Armstrong, Sarah Miles as Katherine Armstrong, David Thewlis as Oswald Martin and Lesley Sharp as Martin's wife, Constance. It was directed by Mike Hodges and won a BAFTA in 1995. As well as telling the main story of Armstrong's crimes, the series develops the courtship of Martin and his wife and shows the effects of events on Armstrong's children. Deadly Advice, a black comedy released in 1994, was set in Hay-on-Wye and had Jane Horrocks becoming a serial killer under the ghostly influence of Armstrong (played by Edward Woodward) and others like Dr Crippen (Hywel Bennett) and Jack the Ripper (John Mills). The Hay Poisoner Armstrong's home in Cusop was subsequently owned by Martin Beales, a solicitor working in Armstrong's former office in Hay.

A selection from the work was released on CD Vergo under the auspices of WDR's Akustische Kunst Studio. and (among others) Hyde Park Barracks (Sydney) and the Museum of Sydney.‘Musical as much as narrative, cubist and multilingual, Carter’s critically significant theoretical and historical work engages silenced auditory history in Australia and repressed dialogic encounters between estranged (often indigenous) peoples and languages.’ (Virginia Madsen, ‘Written in Air: Experiments in Radio’, in Experimental Music, ed. Gail Priest, Sydney: UNSW Press, 2009, 154-174, 169.) A multilingual soundscape (‘Columbus Echo’) designed for the Acquario di Genova led to a collaboration with composer Luciano Berio and to the ‘anti- novel’ Baroque Memories (the Italian translation included a preface by Antonio Tabucchi, who noted how a ‘further complication of an already complex situation produces, paradoxically, a simplification and, indeed, a resolution.’Antonio Tabucchi, Prefazio, Memorie Barocche, Una stravaganza, trans. Stefano Stoja, Argo Editrice, Lecce, 1998. In the late 1990s his studies in the mythopoetic mechanisms of placemaking led to major commissions as a public artist.

His story-based tool for urban design and program integration, the ‘creative template’, was adopted by the Western Australian Government's major planning agency, the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority, in 2016. His collaborations with artists between 1990 and 2004 were described in the book Material Thinking: the theory and practice of creative research (2004).Informed by this publication, the journal Studies in Material Thinking was established in 2007. More recently he has focused on the choreography of sociability in public settings, exploring the concept of the designer as dramaturg. His publications in this area are characterized as ‘cultural writing,’ as the vehicle of the analysis is invariably a distinctive literary style and narrative structure. In Meeting Place (2013) he differentiated between encounter and meeting to foreground the performative foundations of civil coexistence.See Trapè, Roberta, ‘Practices of Meeting: Paul Carter talks to Roberta Trapè, Il Tolomeo, recensioni e inedita delle nuove letterature, XVI, primo e secondo fascicolo, anno 2013, 47-54. Places Made After Their Stories (2015) introduces the notion of ‘choreotopography’ to characterize the arrangements that emerge from feedback between society and setting.

He is wearing a black jacket with the white collar of his shirt showing. Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) was a British natural philosopher, Dissenting clergyman, political theorist, theologian, and educator. He is best known for his discovery, simultaneously with Antoine Lavoisier, of oxygen gas. A member of marginalized religious groups throughout his life and a proponent of what was called \\"rational Dissent,\\" Priestley advocated religious toleration and equal rights for Dissenters. He argued for extensive civil rights in works such as the important Essay on the First Principles of Government, believing that individuals could bring about progress and eventually the Millennium; he was the foremost British expounder of providentialism.Tapper, Alan. \\"Joseph Priestley.\\" Dictionary of Literary Biography 252: British Philosophers 1500–1799. Eds. Philip B. Dematteis and Peter S. Fosl. Detroit: Gale Group (2002), 314. Priestley also made significant contributions to education, publishing, among other things, The Rudiments of English Grammar, a seminal work on English grammar. In his most lasting contributions to education, he argued for the benefits of a liberal arts education and of the value of the study of modern history. In his metaphysical works, Priestley \\"attempt[ed] to combine theism, materialism, and determinism,\\" a project that has been called \\"audacious and original.\\" Throughout his life, Priestley was known not only as a political and theological controversialist but also as a natural philosopher. His scientific reputation rested on his writings on electricity, his invention of soda water, and his discovery of 10 previously unknown \\"Airs\\" (gases), that he reported about from 1774-1786 in a giant book of 6 volumes: Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. The most important of these newly discovered airs, was named by Priestley as \\"dephlogisticated air\\" (oxygen). But Priestley's determination to reject Lavoisier's \\"new chemistry\\" and to cling to phlogiston theory left him isolated within the scientific community. This list classifies all of the works by Priestley. It is taken from Ronald E. Crook's A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804 (unless otherwise noted) and it follows very closely his generic subdivisions.

It lies in the Smíchov district of the city. It is mentioned in texts as early as 1355. Until the 18th century, it was called Maltézský Island (after the owner of the Maltese monastery Panny Marie pod řetězem in the Lesser Quarter). Subsequently it was named after members of Prague's Jewish community who owned the land – Such names include Hykyšův, Funkovský, and Židovský. The island was artificially enlarged with the construction of the Smíchov floodgates (1913–1916). The south of the Island was attached to Petržílkovského island and a long dividing wall was built on the north side. The floodgates have two locks and they bypass two weirs on the river. An allegorical statue of the Vltava river and its tributaries stands on the northern side of the island. Each year on All Souls' Day (November 2), members of the association \\"Vltavan\\" place a wreath here as a memorial to those who have drowned in the river. The present-day segmented foot-bridge to the island was built in 1933. It is built on supports originally constructed for a proposed bridge from Myslíkova street (Jiráskův Bridge). The island's current name originates from the beginning of the 1960s, when a children's playground was built here.  References  * Jaroslav Láník: Historie a současnost podnikání v Praze, díl pátý.

It was released in the UK on 8 June 2007. The director, Chris Atkins, said on 1 May that he wanted to expose \\"the Orwellian state\\" that now threatened Britain as a result of Mr Blair's policies. There is also an accompanying book. Synopsis The film starts with three coaches of peace protesters on the way to the RAF Base in Fairford, Gloucestershire on 22 March 2003 held for two hours by 100 riot police and escorted back to London denied the right to protest. An animated sequence profiles the key events of WWII; Reichstag fire, Kristallnacht, the invasion of Poland, allied victory and the subsequent European convention on Human rights designed to ensure it never happened again. Archive footage of Tony Blair defends New Labour laws which undo this convention and which the 7 July 2005 London bombings survivor Rachel North rallies against. Freedom of speech Tony Benn introduces the story of the expulsion of Walter Wolfgang from the Labour Party Conference for protesting a speech by Jack Straw. Toby Rhodes of Splash Clothing relates the story of a 20-year-old student stopped by police for wearing one of his company's \\"Bollocks to Blair\\" T-shirts. Right to protest Maya Evans and Milan Rai of the Justice Not Vengeance discuss their arrest for an illegal memorial service outside Downing Street. Photos, title cards and archive footage tell the story of protester Brian Haw. Peace Campaigners Sylvia & Helen talk about their arrest at the Menwith Hill US Military Base in Yorkshire. Baptist Minister Malcolm Carroll and the Rickford family discuss the Climate Camp protest at East Midlands Airport. Finally the collusion between police and EDO MBM to break anti-war protests by the Brighton & Hove Citizens Weapons' Inspectors is revealed. Right to privacy Director Chris Atkins visits Counter Terror World 2006 at Kensington Olympia, London to discuss surveillance technology with the delegates. An animated sequence introduces the Panopticon and compares it to the surveillance society before going to profile the history of ID Cards from Harry Willcock's 1950 protest to their use in the Rwanda genocide and by the Stasi, the East German secret police. Photos, title cards and archive footage tell the story of Blair and Bush's rush to war on Iraq and the resultant 7/7 attacks which the film maintains ID cards could not have prevented. Innocent until proven guilty John Tulloch rallies against the proposed 90-day detention extension which The Sun used his image to promote. Archive footage of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair defends the 2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid on the home of Abdul Koyair and Mohammed Abdul Kahar. An animated sequence details Clause 39 of the Magna Carta, which establishes Habeas Corpus and lead to the banning of slavery, but following wartime suspension and the internment laws in Northern Ireland is, according to interviewees, has been undermined by the Blair government. No detention without charge Retired Headmistresses Jennifer and Des visit the confines of Algerian asylum seeker Mouloud Sihali who is under indefinite house arrest without charge due to his involvement in the alleged Wood Green ricin plot used as an example by Colin Powell in his UN testimony despite no ricin ever being found. Former jury members testify to the lack of evidence in the trial which saw him acquitted only to be later re- arrested and threatened with deportation. David Bermingham of the Natwest 3 reveals the dangers of the extradition treaty with the US signed by David Blunkett. Ban on torture Former Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg and the family of Libyan exile Omar Deghayes reveal prisoner abuses including the force feeding of hunger strikers in the \\"torture chair\\". The shackle-shuffle protest outside the Hiatt factory in Birmingham protests the manufacture of shackles for Guantanamo. A mock advert for RendAir introduces the illegal nature of extraordinary rendition flights to regimes which use torture with the alleged complicity of the British government denied by Jack Straw and Tony Blair. The Road to Guantánamo star Riz Ahmed discusses his own detainment. An epilogue contends that neither Gordon Brown nor any of his generations of successors are likely to return the rights which Tony Blair have removed without a fight like that put up by the Fairford coach campaigner who won their case at the House of Lords.

He played a major role in Greece's war effort during World War I, and was the commander-in-chief of the Greek Army of Asia Minor in 1919–20. In later life he was a member of the Greek Senate and served as its speaker in 1930–32. Life Leonidas Paraskevopoulos was born on 7 October 1860 on the island of Kythnos. His family hailed from Smyrna, Asia Minor. Kepi and sword of Paraskevopoulos, National Historical Museum, Athens He entered the Hellenic Army Academy and graduated in November 1881 as an Artillery 2nd Lieutenant. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, he served in the expeditionary corps sent to Crete under Colonel Timoleon Vassos. During the First Balkan War of 1912–13, he initially served as the commander of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, but already at the Battle of Sarantaporo he was appointed with the supervision of the entire artillery establishment of the Army of Thessaly, a post he held until the capture of Thessaloniki. He then succeeded Konstantinos Kallaris as commander of the 2nd Infantry Division, when the latter was transferred to the Epirus front. There again, however, he was after a few days appointed as Chief of Artillery of the Army of Epirus, playing a crucial role in the successful Battle of Bizani and the capture of Ioannina. In April 1913 he was placed in command of the newly formed 10th Infantry Division, which he led during the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, from the Battle of Dojran to the area of Pečkovo. In World War I, Paraskevopoulos became commander of I Army Corps on the Strymon sector on the eastern flank of the Macedonian front in 1917–18, before being appointed commander-in-chief of the Greek Army in October 1918. After World War I, Paraskevopoulos took over direct command of the Greek forces that occupied Smyrna in 1919 in accordance with the Treaty of Sèvres. Under his command, the Hellenic Army successfully extended their occupation zone, from the greater Smyrna area, south to Aydin and north to Bursa. With the electoral victory of the pro-royalist United Opposition in November 1920, he was dismissed on 25 November 1920. After the end of the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), Paraskevopoulos entered politics. He was appointed to the Greek Senate in 1929 \\"on merit\\", and served as President of the Senate in 1930–32. He died on 16 May 1936 in Paris, France, aged 75. He was awarded Serbian Order of the White Eagle.

In addition to over 850 motorcycles, which cover a century of motorcycle manufacture, the museum has conference facilities. It is located close to the junction of the A45 and the M42, very close to Birmingham Airport. History left The founder of the museum, construction entrepreneur and self-made millionaire Roy Richards, started collecting good examples of British motorcycles in the 1970s. The museum opened in 1984 with an initial collection of 350 machines. The museum was developed to include conference facilities in 1985. The museum has become the largest collection of British motorcycles in the world, with over 250,000 visitors a year. 2003 fire Aftermath of the fire The museum was severely damaged by a fire which broke out shortly before 5pm on 16 September 2003. West Midlands Fire Service investigators concluded that a cigarette thrown away in a designated smoking area was responsible for igniting a pile of cardboard boxes containing old air-conditioning filters. The fire spread very rapidly inside the museum's dropped ceilings which, though conforming to safety regulations, did not contain a sprinkler system. The building did have smoke detection and fire alarm equipment which contacted the fire service within minutes of the fire starting, however the fire had taken a strong hold before it was discovered on site. Staff and people attending a conference helped to save more than 300 historic motorcycles but three of the five exhibition halls were completely burnt out. 120 firefighters were needed to put out the inferno which was visible for . Fire crews were delayed by rush hour traffic and hindered by an inadequate hydrant on site, but the fire was extinguished after about an hour and a half. Many of the museum's rarest and irreplaceable exhibits were destroyed, with the loss of 380 motorcycles. The cost of the fire was estimated at over £14 million. After fifteen months and a £20m rebuild which included installation of a £1.2m sprinkler system, the museum was reopened on 1 December 2004. 150 of the motorcycles that had been destroyed in the fire were fully restored for the re-opening. Many of the fire damaged motorcycles were restored to showroom condition. Exhibits The museum is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust. The motorcycles on display represent examples of well known makes, such as BSA, Triumph and Norton as well as less well known makers including Coventry-Eagle, Montgomery and New Imperial. Golden Dream Brough Golden Dream Brough Superior One of the most valuable motorcycles in the world the Brough Superior Golden Dream, which is the only example of George Brough's show model for the 1938 Olympia show. Handbuilt by Brough and Freddie Dixon, the Golden Dream has two pairs of horizontally opposed cylinders, one above the other, with two longitudinal crankshafts to give vibration free running. The two crankshafts shafts are geared together, with one driving the rear wheel and the other driving the oil pump and magdyno. Two Brough Dream Fours were built but World War II stopped development. The second Brough Dream has a black and chrome finish and is in private ownership. Wilkinson Luxury Tourer Wilkinson 850 Built by the Wilkinson Sword company before the First World War the first 'Wilkinsons' were aimed at military use. Optional accessories included a sidecar complete with Maxim machine gun, and a steering wheel instead of handlebars. The model displayed in the museum was built in 1912 and is the top-of-the-range four-cylinder water-cooled shaft drive version. Originally air-cooled, the Wilkinson TMC engine was water-cooled from 1911 and described as a ‘Luxury Touring Motor Cycle’.

He chose the name Sani (Arabic for \\"the second\\") to avoid confusion with his namesake, Mirza Fatali Akhundov. Suleyman Sani Akhundov Life and contributions Akhundov was born to a noble family in Shusha (then part of the Russian Empire) and graduated from the Transcaucasian Teachers Seminary (present-day Gori, Georgia) in 1894. He was involved in teaching and journalism for the rest of his life. He was the co-author of the Azeri language textbook İkinci il (\\"The Second Year\\"), which was published in 1906. After Sovietization he served as Minister of Education of Azerbaijani SSR's Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast for a short period of time. In 1922, Suleyman Sani Akhundov was chosen the first chairman of the Union of Writers and Poets of Azerbaijan. In 1932, he was awarded an honorary title of the Hero of Labour for his merits in literary and pedagogical activity. Between 1920 and 1930, he was chosen as a member of the Baku Soviet, probationary member of the Executive Committee of Baku, and mesehver of the Central Executive Committee of the Azerbaijan SSR. Creativity stories  Akhundov's first fictional piece, Tamahkar (\\"The Greedy One\\"), was written in 1899. Between 1912 and 1913 he wrote a pentalogy entitled Qorxulu nağıllar (\\"Scary Stories\\"), which dealt with the theme of poverty and social inequality and therefore became one of the most popular children books later in the Soviet epoch. Works written by the writer after the 1905 Russian Revolution were concerned with social-political problems, highlighting them from the democratic position. In his works written after 1920 he continued with his criticism of patriarchal norms, social backwardness, and despotism of the ruling class, and describes the expectations of people from the newly established political system. Such works as \\"Fortune's wheel\\" (1921), \\"Falcon's nest\\" (1921), \\"Love and revenge\\" (1922) drama were written by Suleyman Sani Akhundov.

He moved to League Two club Scunthorpe United in 2004 but after only scoring one goal for them signed for Alfreton Town. He signed for Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds in 2006, where he played for three seasons, before signing for divisional rivals York City in 2009. He played for them in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final before signing for Aldershot Town in 2011. He spent two seasons at Aldershot and during that time had loan spells with Grimsby Town and York. After a season with Hereford United he signed for Gateshead in 2014. Career Early career Born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Rankine started his career in the youth system of hometown club Doncaster Rovers. He played for Armthorpe Welfare on work experience in 2002 and was released by Doncaster at the end of the 2002–03 season after failing to progress into their first team.

He was unable to play for them in the opening match of 2003–04 after suffering whiplash following a car crash. He made 47 appearances and scored nine goals in 2003–04. Scunthorpe United Rankine signed for League Two club Scunthorpe United on 15 September 2004 on non- contract terms, following a trial after being recommended to the club by Barrow manager Lee Turnbull. The move came having made 11 appearances and scored three goals for Barrow up to that point during 2004–05. He scored the winning goal for Scunthorpe away to Bury on his debut with a close range finish from Andy Crosby's knock-down in the 89th minute, which gave his team a 1–0 victory.

He made his debut in a 0–0 draw with Rotherham United three days later before finishing the loan period with four appearances. Bournemouth were hoping to extend the loan, but Rushden wanted him to return. He scored two goals for Rushden in a 9–0 victory over Weymouth on 20 February 2009, who had been forced to field a youth team. He finished 2008–09 with 38 appearances and eight goals for Rushden. York City Rankine signed for Rushden's Conference Premier rivals York City on 12 June 2009 on a two-year contract for a fee of £10,000, with York's Craig Farrell moving in the opposite direction. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United on 8 August 2009. He scored his first goal for York after winning and scoring a penalty kick in a 2–0 victory over Forest Green Rovers on 15 August.

He agreed to sign for Aldershot on 12 May 2011 on a free transfer. Rankine signed for Conference Premier club Grimsby Town on 23 November 2012 on a one-month loan. He made his debut a day later as a 66th-minute substitute in Grimsby's 0–0 home draw with Buxton in the FA Trophy first round. Rankine returned to Aldershot on 4 January 2013 as he wanted a more long-term extension to his loan at Grimsby, who were only offering a one-month extension. He had made six appearances for Grimsby. On 12 February 2013, Rankine returned to former club York, by this time playing in League Two, on loan until the end of 2012–13. He made his first appearance since returning later that day, playing in York's 0–0 home draw with Gillingham. Rankine was sent back to Aldershot on 4 April 2013 having been deemed surplus to requirements by new manager Nigel Worthington. He had made eight appearance for York. He finished the season with two goals in 28 appearances for Aldershot as they were relegated to the Conference Premier. Hereford United He joined Tamworth on trial in July 2013, scoring in the club's 2–0 friendly win over Atherstone Town. Shortly afterwards, he signed for Conference Premier club Hereford United on a one-year contract following a trial. He made his debut in Hereford's 1–1 draw at home to Braintree Town in the opening match of 2013–14 on 10 August 2013. Rankine scored his first goal for Hereford with the equalising goal in the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw away to Hyde on 17 August 2013. He scored an 88th-minute winner for Hereford in a 2–1 away win over Aldershot, a result that saw the club avoid relegation on goal difference. However, Hereford were later expelled from the Football Conference and he commented that the situation at the club was \\"embarrassing\\" and a \\"disgrace\\". He had made 34 appearances and scored seven goals for Hereford in the 2013–14 season. Gateshead Rankine signed for Conference Premier club Gateshead, managed by his former Alfreton and York manager Mills, on 30 June 2014 on a one-year contract. He made his debut on 13 September 2014 as a 61st- minute substitute in a 1–0 win against Dartford, and scored his first goal for the club with a close-range finished from a Carl Finnigan cross in the 86th minute of a 2–2 extra time draw to Wrexham in the FA Trophy third round on 7 February 2015, with Gateshead losing 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out. Rankine made 36 appearances and scored five goals in 2014–15 as Gateshead finished 10th in the Conference Premier. Altrincham Rankine signed for National League club Altrincham on 3 June 2015, leaving Gateshead as he was unhappy with how regularly he was playing there. He made his debut in a 1–0 home defeat to Forest Green on 8 August 2015 and scored his first goal with a looping header from a James Lawrie cross in the 29th minute of a 2–1 home victory over Tranmere Rovers on 29 August. Rankine finished 2015–16 with 15 goals from 45 appearances as Altrincham were relegated in 22nd place in the National League. Guiseley Rankine signed for National League club Guiseley on 26 May 2016. Return to York City Rankine signed for newly relegated National League North club York City on 16 June 2017 on a one-year contract, marking his third spell with the club. He scored two goals from eight appearances as York finished 2017–18 in 11th place in the table. He was released at the end of the season. Style of play Rankine played as a striker and was described as a target man, not being a prolific goalscorer, and he said \\"I just like to chip away and work as hard as I can and, hopefully, then you get rewarded with goals\\". He had the \\"ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems\\" and possessed the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said \\"He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in\\". York manager Martin Foyle said that Rankine \\"will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels.\\" Personal life Rankine is the nephew of former player Mark Rankine and cousin of Tottenham Hotspur's Danny Rose. He has one child, a boy. He was arrested along with York players Michael Gash, Michael Ingham and Craig Nelthorpe in August 2009 following an incident involving two other men at a Subway outlet on a night out. The four appeared at York Magistrates' Court on 14 January 2010 after being charged with affray. Rankine denied a charge of affray and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge after appearing at York Crown Court on 1 September. Rankine retired from playing football in 2018 and began working as an intermediary, helping players transition from non-League to professional football.

() is a Philippine news program on ABS-CBN which was aired from January 6, 1992 to March 2, 2001. Originally part of the flagship national network news broadcast TV Patrol, it eventually evolved into a legendary long- running public service program. Three years later, it revived the program again for Saturday afternoon airings as Hoy Gising! Kapamilya. Origin and style Hoy Gising! was a public service program that began on TV Patrol as a segment handled by the late Frankie Evangelista. It then grew into a half-hour program (later extended to an hour) chiefly anchored by Kris Aquino, Ted Failon, and Korina Sanchez. The formula remained the same: tackling all sorts of problems associated with the government, as well as social issues. The difference between the show and others of its kind was its semi-humorous method of commenting on the issues and problems it featured, and urging those concerned to \\"wake up.\\" The show was directed by Rolly G. Reyes. He wrote the lyrics of the theme song (which is set to the tune of Shame and Scandal by Trini Lopez), and created the segment titles. The show had a mambo-themed opening song performed by The Kumbancheros.

Martín de Azpilcueta  Life  He was born in Barásoain, Navarre, and was a relative of Francis Xavier. He obtained a degree in theology at Alcalá, then in 1518 he obtained a degree of doctor in canon law from Toulouse in France.Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxii. Beginning in 1524, Azpilcueta served in several canon law chairs at the University of Salamanca. From 1538 to 1556, he taught at Coimbra University in Portugal, at the invitation of the kings of Portugal and Spain.Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxii. At the age of eighty he went to Rome to defend his friend Bartolomeo Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo, accused before the Tribunal of the Inquisition. Though he failed to exculpate the Archbishop, Aspilcueta was highly honoured at Rome by several popes, and was looked on as an oracle of learning and prudence. His humility, disinterestedness, and charity were proverbial. Azpilcueta died in Rome at the age of 94.Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxii. He is buried in the national Church of San Antonio de' Portoghesi. Among other lives of Azpilcueta there is one by his nephew, prefixed to the Roman edition of his works.  Works  Consilia et responsa, 1594 His Manual de confesores y penitentes (1549), originally written in Spanish, was enormously influential in the fields of canon law and ethics, and by the first quarter of the seventeenth century, it had gone through 81 editions.Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxii. The Manual made an important step in the development of moral theology as its own discipline.Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxiii. One of the four appendices Azpilcueta wrote for the Manual, addressing exchange, supply and demand, and money, has recently been translated into English and published as On Exchange (2014).Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014. In this work, Azpilcueta argued that the use of \\"money in exchanges is not unnatural,\\" as Aristotle had claimed, and \\"put money on the same level as any other merchandise, and, consequently, established that the morality of exchanges did not depend on money as their object but on an equitable exchange.\\"Martin de Azpilcueta, On Exchange. CLP Academic, 2014, p.xxxiii. In his work on the revenues of benefices, first published in Spanish (Salamanca, 1566), translated into Latin (1568), and dedicated to Philip II of Spain and Pope Pius V, he maintained that beneficed clergymen were free to expend the fruits of their benefices only for their own necessary support and that of the poor. In the face of use by the reformed Church of natural languages in their liturgy and divulgation, the Catholic Counter-Reformation reacted by hanging onto Latin. On the other hand, Azpilcueta supported the use of vernaculars in his 1545 Commento en Romance released in Coimbra, writing down the prayers Our Father, Hail Mary, and Creed both in Latin and Romance, i.e. Castilian, coming up against the opposition of the defenders of the Latin tradition. Later, he had to explain in his 1586 Miscellaneum centum that vernaculars had been used before, as approved by bishops and inquisitors, citing \\"a pious and knowledgeable Cantabrian\\", referring to Sancho de Elso from Estella, who had used Basque in different prayers. He partially put down the unfamiliarity of \\"the rustic dwellers and highlanders\\" with the Christian teachings to the use of Latin, \\"instead of their native language, learning them by heart\\". He wrote numerous other works, e.g. on the Breviary, the regulars, ecclesiastical property, the jubilee year, etc. A complete edition of his works was printed at Rome in 1590 (3 vols. fol.); also at Lyons, 1590; Venice, 1602; and Cologne, 1615 (2 vols. fol.). A compendium of his writings was made by J. Dastellanus (Venice, 1598).  Other works  *  Time value of money  He allegedly invented the mathematical concept of the time value of money.

Part of the Downs is the Folkestone to Etchinghill Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated for its geological and biological interest. Topography Folkestone Downs stretch for 5 kilometres from East Cliff and Warren Country Park in the east to Peene Quarry in the west. The downs rise steeply above the town of Folkestone to heights in excess of 150 metres. The highest point is Dover Hill at 170 metres. The Channel Tunnel Terminal lies at the foot of the downs and the British portal is directly below the slopes of Castle Hill. The downland is classified as CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum and CG5 Bromus erectus - Brachypodium pinnatum calcareous grassland with smaller areas of CG2 Festuca ovina - Avenula pratensis grassland. There are also areas of scrubland and woodland. Ecology Flora Folkestone Downs is one of the largest areas of unimproved chalk downland in Kent. The extensive flora includes many typical species found in chalk grassland including horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and small scabious, as well as scarce species such as bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea). Many species of orchid grow on the downs notably the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) as well as the nationally scarce early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) and man orchid (Aceras anthropophorum). The nationally scarce burnt orchid (Neotinea ustulata) has also been recorded in the past. Folkestone Downs is also notable for its extensive lichen flora. Fauna The scrub and woodland provide breeding habitats for many species of birds. Folkestone Downs is particularly notable for its insect fauna. Up to 32 species of butterfly have been recorded on the downs including the Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus), chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and small blue (Cupido minimus). Several rare species of moth have been recorded including the straw belle (Aspitates gilvaria) and the annulet moth (Charissa obscurata). Ownership, management and access Much of Folkestone Downs is owned by Eurotunnel and managed by the White Cliffs Countryside Project. Grazing was abandoned after the Second World War resulting in an invasion of coarse grasses and scrub. This resulted in a reduction of the grassland flora, particularly after the rabbit population was reduced by myxamatosis in the 1950s. Cattle grazing was resumed in 1990. Much of the downland is designated as open access land following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

Snubbing is a type of heavy well intervention performed on oil and gas wells. It involves running the BHA on a pipe string using a hydraulic workover rig. Unlike wireline or coiled tubing, the pipe is not spooled off a drum but made up and broken up while running in and pulling out, much like conventional drill pipe. Due to the large rigup, it is only used for the most demanding of operations when lighter intervention techniques do not offer the strength and durability. The first snubbing unit was primarily designed to work in well control situations to \\"snub\\" drill pipe and or casing into, or out of, a well bore when conventional well killing methods could not be used. Unlike conventional drilling and completions operations, snubbing can be performed with the well still under pressure (not killed). When done so, it is called hydraulic workover. It can also be performed without having to remove the Christmas tree from the wellhead. Rigup A snubbing rigup is a very tall structure. It consists of a hydraulically powered snubbing unit, which provides the force on a pipe, above a string of multi-layered pressure control components. At the top of the snubbing unit is the basket, which serves as the control post for the rigup. Below the basket are the hydraulic jacks, which power the pipe into and out of the hole. It consists of two mechanisms for applying force to the pipe in either direction. Each mechanism consists of travelling and stationary slips. The travelling slips are used to move the pipe, while the stationary slips are used to hold the pipe while the travelling slips are repositioned between strokes. Stripping the pipe Unlike coiled tubing or wireline, where the wire or tubing is always the same diameter allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams. Once the collar is in between the rams, the upper rams are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the rams. This process is repeated as successive collars are lowered into the well. When pulling out of hole, this procedure is reversed. Another popular method of stripping tubulars in/out of a wellbore is with the use of an \\"Annular\\" Blow Out Preventer (BOP). An Annular BOP consists of a natural or synthetic rubber element with encased metal reinforcement sections. A hydraulic piston pushes the annular element up into a concaved cap which forces the element diameter to decrease in size. When the element diameter is closed sufficiently it forms a seal around the body of the pipe. The upset or larger diameter section of a pipe connection can be pulled or pushed through a closed annular element without damage and while still maintaining a gas tight seal. Annular BOPs come in various sizes and pressure ratings and are ideal for lower pressure gas wells. Generally, the maximum pressure for stripping pipe through an annular is equal to 40% of the maximum static pressure rating dry or 60% if the pipe is lubricated as it is being stripped through the annular. Heavy-pipe and light-pipe Because snubbing is normally done under pressure, initially, the weight of pipe in wellbore is less than the force due to the wellbore pressure. This is described as light-pipe: downward force is required on the pipe to force it in against resistance. Once a sufficient amount of pipe has been run into the hole, the weight becomes sufficient to overpower the wellbore pressure and the pipe naturally wants to fall in the hole; this is heavy-pipe. At this point, the snubbing mechanism is changed over to the one which provides upward force to hold the pipe and lower it controllably into the well. When pulling out of hole, upward force is initially used to lift the pipe until the equilibrium point, whenceforth downward force is used to prevent wellbore pressure from blowing the light- pipe out of hole. Risks The more complex method of pressure control, as compared to coiled tubing and wireline, naturally invites more opportunity for things to go wrong. One such peril was seen in June 2007 on the Shearwater platform. Snubbing was being used to clean out large pebble, which had entered the well through a collapsed liner. While pulling out of hole, one stripping ram was not opened sufficiently and a collar on the pipe string caught on the ram. The excessive force applied to the pipe caused it to break apart, dropping the string below the failure into the well. In the time it took to prepare to fish out the pipe, the pebbles in the process of being circulated out, settled on the pipe, preventing successful fishing. Although problems such as the one described above can happen they are extremely rare and always avoidable. In the case above, adequate supervision could have prevented this dramatic consequence of operator error by limiting the hydraulic force allowable to be an applied to a level below what was required to part the pipe string. Note Not all Snubbing units are large and time consuming to rig up. In the Canadian oilfield many companies use small \\"Stand Alone\\" snubbing units which can be broken down and rigged up in less than 3hrs. These Units consist of 4 segments which can be placed onto 4 separate trucks. These 4 segments consist of the following: PUMP TRUCK - The Engine of the truck is used to power the pump (which is a series of valves mounted behind the cab). \\\\-----> The Pump truck has a trailer which is the MUD TANK SNUBBING BASKET - Once again the trucks engine is used to power the unit's hydraulics. The Basket lies on the bed of the truck behind the cab. ACCUMULATOR TRUCK - The Accumulator Unit (or Coomie) is run off a PTO that is connected to the trucks engine. The Coomie Unit also pulls a trailer. \\\\------> The trailer off the Coomie Unit becomes the CATWALK and PIPE RACKS. \\\\------> Mounted on the trailer is the TOOL SHED (or JUNK SKID - a small Shipping container full of tools), and also the LMS (Load Management System), which is used to support the weight of the basket while operational. PICKER - The Picker, is a truck with a small crane (or Picker) on its back. This Picker is used to Rig up the basket. It also tows a trailer. \\\\------> The trailer for the Picker is the DOGHOUSE. The Doghouse is then split into the TOILET BLOCK and OFFICE, and the GENERATORS (GEN-SETS) which provide electrical power to the rig. These units are set up in such a fashion so as to be able to cope with the harsh roads and remote locations required in the Canadian winter. Units structures and capacities Units varies in strength, there are 95K, 120K, 150K, 170K, 225K, 340K, 460K, 600K The number indicates their working strength in pulling force, and 150K means the unit is capable of pulling maximal 150000 pounds. This is based on the hydraulic force acting on the size of the unit's piston size.

Both the stage and film versions are set on Christmas Eve and tell the gentle, light-hearted story of two couples, one newlywed and the other married for five years, both experiencing pains and difficulties in their relationships. The two male characters are veterans of the Korean War. The younger of the two experiences post traumatic stress (shellshock, battle fatigue, combat stress reaction), and the older man suffers from feelings of inadequacy towards his wife, the daughter of his boss. However, the observance of each other’s troubles brings both couples to realize what they have and to reconcile their own relationships. Williams wrote the first draft of the play in November 1958 \\"in a rush of activity partly induced by drugs.\\" It was workshopped for a week in December 1958 and officially premiered at the Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway on November 10, 1960. It was directed by George Roy Hill, the stage settings and lighting were by Jo Mielziner, the costumes were by Patricia Zipprodt, and the production stage manager was William Chambers. The play, which Williams subtitled \\"a serious comedy,\\" was a departure from the playwright's usual dark dramas, and was written partly in response to a Hollywood columnist who had asked why his plays were always \\"plunging into the sewers.\\" Williams responded to the criticism by writing Period of Adjustment and arguing, in a piece that was published in The New York Times, The play received average reviews and closed March 4, 1961 after 132 performances. The original cast was: * James Daly as Ralph Bates * Barbara Baxley as Isabel Haverstick * Robert Webber as George Haverstick * Helen Martin as Susie * Esther Benson as Lady Caroler In February 2006, the play was revived at the Almeida Theatre in London.

Early life Cavendish was the son of Sir Henry Cavendish, 1st Baronet, and his wife Anne (née Pyne), daughter of Sir Richard Pyne, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. This branch of the Cavendish family descended from Henry Cavendish, illegitimate son of Henry Cavendish of Tutbury Prior, eldest son of Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick and elder brother of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire (the ancestor of the Dukes of Devonshire). The Pyne family were substantial landowners in County Cork, and owned the celebrated Ballyvolane House. Member of Parliament He sat in the Irish House of Commons for Lismore from 1766 to 1768 and from 1776 to 1791 (when he was declared not duly elected in the 1790 election). He instead represented Killybegs from 1791 to 1797, also serving as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland and as Receiver-General in Ireland. In 1779 he was admitted to the Irish Privy Council. He again represented Lismore from 1798 to the Act of Union in 1800/01. Cavendish was also a member of the British House of Commons for Lostwithiel between 1768 and 1774. Parliamentary diarist He is chiefly remembered for the enormous amounts of notes he took of the debates in this session of Parliament using Gurney's system of shorthand. The 1768 to 1774 Parliament has otherwise been termed the unreported Parliament, making Cavendish's notes an important historical source. During this time the reporting of parliamentary debates was forbidden. The notes, which include speeches by Edmund Burke, George Grenville, Lord North and Charles James Fox, are now stored in the British Museum. Cavendish's original notebooks have gone missing but they were all transcribed by a clerk and fifty longhand manuscripts are in the British Library.Peter D. G. Thomas, ‘Cavendish, Sir Henry, second baronet (1732–1804)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 Aug 2011. They have 15,700 pages with nearly 3,000,000 words. There are gaps in these volumes, where the clerk could not decipher Cavendish's hand. Cavendish only managed to fill in the gaps for twelve volumes out of fifty. Selections from these volumes were published in two volumes in 1839 and 1841. The debates on American affairs were published by R. C. Simmons and P. D. G. Thomas in the twentieth century. Cavendish also kept a record of the Irish House of Commons between 1776 and 1789 (currently in the Library of Congress). These amount to thirty-seven longhand volumes (containing more than 2,000,000 words) and forty-five of originally fifty-four shorthand journals. According to P. D. G. Thomas, \\"The fullness and accuracy of both diaries, in so far as that can be established by comparison with other sources, is remarkable...fewer than 100 omissions have been detected among the 12,000 speeches he noted at Westminster, and he seems to have captured much of the debating verbatim\\". Personal life Cavendish married Sarah Bradshaw, the daughter of Richard Bradshaw and Deborah Thompson, in 1757; they had eight children. In 1792 she was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baroness Waterpark, in the County of Dublin, in honour of her husband. Cavendish died in August 1804, aged 71, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Richard. Lady Waterpark died in August 1807, aged 67. The second son, George Cavendish was a politician. The third son, Augustus, who took the surname Bradshaw in order to inherit a legacy from his grandfather, was the defendant in a celebrated criminal conversation action brought by George Frederick Nugent, 7th Earl of Westmeath in 1796, and was required to pay £10000 damages. The Westmeaths later divorced and Augustus married the former Countess. Cavendish's daughter, the younger Sarah, married Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Mountnorris.

In 1938 it was tested in the Curtiss SO3C Seamew but was found to be unreliable with a tendency to overheat in low-speed flight, but would still be the most produced aircraft to have the V-770, with 795 being built. By 1941 a more developed V-770 was installed in the Fairchild XAT-14 Gunner prototype gunnery school aircraft, which went into limited production as the Fairchild AT-21 Gunner, of which 174 were built, not including one radial engine prototype. Produced from 1941 to 1945, the V-770 featured a two-piece aluminum alloy crankcase, steel cylinder barrels with integral aluminum alloy fins and aluminum alloy heads. The V-770 was the only American inverted V-12 air-cooled engine to reach production.

She was built in 1953 as a passenger liner at Finnboda shipyard in Nacka, Sweden as SS Birger Jarl for Rederi AB Svea. In 1973 she was sold to Jakob Lines, was renamed SS Bore Nord and converted into a ferry. In 1978 she was bought back by the Ånedin Line (named after the 1970s British TV series The Onedin Line, also popular in Sweden) and was renamed SS Baltic Star. In 1982 the ship's original steam engines were replaced by diesel engines; the ship's prefix hence altered to MS. In 1989 the engines were again replaced by new diesels. In 2002 the ship reverted to the name Birger Jarl.  History  SS Birger Jarl was ordered by Rederi AB Svea from Finnboda shipyard in Nacka, Stockholm, where the keel of the ship was laid on 16 November 1951. She was launched on 15 January 1953 and named after the 13th-century Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. Her maiden voyage was made on 9 June 1953 to Helsinki, after which she started regular services between Stockholm – Helsinki and Stockholm – Turku. SS Birger Jarl is one of the so- called Olympia ships, built to upgrade the ferry traffic for the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympics. Her two sister ships, SS Aallotar and SS Bore III, entered service before the Olympics, but SS Birger Jarl was only delivered the year after. Between 1973 and 1978 the ship sailed under the name SS Bore Nord and between 1978 and 2002 she was SS Baltic Star/MS Baltic Star. In 2002 she was given back her original name. The ship is a listed historic ship of Sweden.  Career  * In 1973 the ship was owned by the Finnish ferry company Jakob Lines and was fitted with a ramp to load vehicles on the aft deck. * In 1976 she was sold to Godby Shipping controlled by the Åland Islands Mikkola family. She was renamed Minisea, but the name was never actually painted on. * In 1976 and 1977 she was laid up in the Oslofjord as a hotel ship. * In 1978 she was acquired by Caribbean Shipping Co Inc, Panama who changed her name to S/S Baltic Star. * In 1978 she was renovated in Turku and a 'skybar' and extra cabins were built on the aft deck. * Since 1979 she has sailed on regular cruises between Stockholm and Mariehamn and sometimes on longer cruises in the Baltic Sea. * On 31 May 1979 she collided with the berth in Mariehamn. The berth was damaged and a few small boats sunk. She became stuck between the berth and the vintage sailing ship SS Pommern, which also was damaged. After several hours the ships were separated and could be repaired. S/S Baltic Star departed for Stockholm one day late. * In 1982 the steam engine was replaced by a MAN diesel of 2,900 hp. * In 1988 the engine was replaced by a MAN diesel of 3,600 hp. Maximum speed increased to 16 knots. * Ånedinlinjen has been using the Bookit reservations system for its reservations and ticket sales since 1997. * In 2002 the ship sailed once again under the Swedish flag and under her original name, M/S Birger Jarl. * Since June 2013 the Birger Jarl is permanently moored at the Ånedin Line terminal on Stockholm's Södermalm as a floating hostel References  External links  * Fakta om Fartyg * Ånedinlinjen * Birger Jarl Video Clips Category:Ships built in Sweden Category:Active ships of Sweden Category:1953 ships ","title":"MS Birger Jarl"},{"id":"10980313","text":"13th century depiction of Basina and Childeric I. Basina or Basine (c. 438 – 477) was remembered as a queen of Thuringia in the middle of the fifth century, according to much later authors such as especially Gregory of Tours. However, because he described this kingdom as being on the Gaulish side of the river Rhine, it is sometimes thought to be the Civitas Tungrorum.  Biography  She left her husband, king Bisinus and went to Roman Gaul. She herself took the initiative to ask for the hand of Childeric I, king of the Franks, and married him. For as she herself said, \\"I want to have the most powerful man in the world, even if I have to cross the ocean for him\\". This remark of hers may have been related to Childeric's successful invasion of the Roman Empire and his attempt to settle a Frankish kingdom on Roman soil. She is the mother of the man who is remembered as the founder of the Frankish realm and modern France. She and her husband Childeric named their son Chlodovech, but he is more well-known under his Latinized name, Clovis I.

They utilize a large bag net suspended directly below or beside the ship. This net is attached to multiple temporary booms projecting from the ship's outriggers and detachable auxiliary masts. Modern basnig typically use generators and electric lights to attract fish and squid. This method is unique to the Philippines. It is common in the Visayas, particularly in the provinces of Capiz and Iloilo. Basnigan A large basnigan (foreground) in Iloilo Basnigan are usually made up of wood with a small [\\"fuente/pwente\\"] cabin wherein the crew sleeps and also where the ship's wheel [\\"timon\\"] is located. It also has outriggers [katig] composed of three huge logs and bamboo. They lure fish with gas powered lights during the nightly fishing trips. 24 to 30 person crew boats go to sea in the afternoon and return early the following morning. Most signal/communications from piloto to makinista and crews are through ringing a bell because of the noise emitted by the machine/engine which is always on because it serves as an engine to run the boat and a generator during the night. Each crew member has individual responsibilities; a Pilot or Piloto is the head of the boat, and has one or two subordinates, Segunda Piloto (2nd Pilot) and sometime Tricera Piloto (3rd Pilot). The Makinista is in charge of the motor and the electrical system, the Timonil is like the driver, the Taong Lambat is in charge of the net in case of damage, the Kusinero is the Cook, and the rest are just crew members. Technique They use bamboo rods called sungay (\\"horn\\"), each of which has a pulley at the end of the bamboo and cable attached to a net with a weight (pabigat)made of molded lead, installed at the bow and stern of the boat, two on both sides on the first section of the boat, two on both sides on the midsection of the boat and two again on the last part of the boat each of the bamboos has a pulley and cable attached to the net with molded lead as weight. Basnigan fishing boat in Coron, Palawan. Note the pulleys on the outriggers. They use huge nets and gas powered lights to attract fish after dark. The captain (piloto) of the ship observes the water, fish movements under the boat and estimates how deep the net should go then asks the crew to get ready. During the preparation of releasing the net, the central lights are turned off until those on the bow and stern will remain turned on in order to ensure the fish stays under the boat but move toward the bow and stern. Away from the center where one of the crew will measure the rope using fathoms [dipa] and will release the net based on the measurement in a very slow process. After completely releasing the net based on the measurement given by the piloto the piloto will the communicate with the machinist to turn of the lights from stern and bow to the midsection of the boat, in slow manner and in order basis. A basnigan in Basilan with children playing on the outriggers The piloto will then communicate with the machinist to turn off the lights from each section. First, the bow and stern then the next section until the only remaining light is the light in the midsection. The Piloto will sometimes use a lid [saklob] that looks like a pail with no bottom or a funnel. This makes the light become thinner like a laser effect these will make the group of fish to compress. The piloto will now give the signal to the crew to start pulling the ropes. The basnig has a total of 8 poles, each poles will have at least 3 crew members one to stop the rope and the two crews pulls the rope. When the [pabigat] weight/net is already one meter above the water one of the crew will walk through the outrigger to pull the net to the side of the boat usually the right side of the boat then the crews from the left side of the boat will pull the net to the right side of the boat. Then the rest of the net will be pulled up by the crew at the right side of the boat until the catch are visible. The piloto will then instruct the crew of two who will manually operate a huge fish net to get the fish into the boat. Then a net will be deployed in the middle part of the boat to temporarily put the live fish for separation. After a few minutes the crew will then start the segregation of the fish according to type and will be stored in a Styrofoam box with crushed ice. A basnig catch mostly composed of types of scad fish, mackerel, tuna, sardines, red fish, anchovy, squid and a few other fishes and crustaceans.

Erik Anton Julius Schmedes (27 August 1868, in Gentofte, Denmark – 23 March 1931, in Vienna) was an operatic tenor, particularly known for his roles in operas by Richard Wagner. He was the brother-in-law of Vaslav Nijinsky's wife. Schmedes was born into a family of musicians, the most prominent of which was his brother Hakon, a noted violinist and composer. After studying in Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, he made his debut as a baritone (following encouragement from Pauline Viardot) in Wiesbaden, in 1891, as the Herald in Lohengrin. He continued to sing as a baritone until 1897. However, after further study with August Iffert in Vienna, his Heldentenor emerged. He made his debut as a tenor in 1898, singing the title role in Siegfried at the Vienna State Opera. His career remained largely based at that opera house, where he was a Kammersänger and one of the most prominent tenors during the years of Gustav Mahler's direction of the company. Schmedes sang frequently at Bayreuth from 1899 through 1906. He also appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1908–09 season, singing in Die Walküre (with Johanna Gadski, Olive Fremstad, and Louise Homer), Tiefland (the United States premiere, opposite Emmy Destinn), Parsifal, Götterdämmerung (conducted by Arturo Toscanini), and Tristan und Isolde (conducted by Mahler). Although he primarily sang roles from the Wagnerian repertoire, Schmedes was also an admired interpreter of Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio and the title role of Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina.Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J., 1979 During his career, he sang 1,130 performances of forty-two roles and recorded for several companies, including Gramophone and Pathé, from 1902 to 1912.Hefling, S., 2003  Legacy  The Heldentenor recorded excerpts from Der Evangelimann, Die Walküre, Lohengrin, Das Rheingold, Siegfried, Pagliacci, Die Meistersinger, Rienzi, Dalibor, Cavalleria rusticana, Tristan und Isolde, Parsifal, Otello, Carmen, Il trovatore, Lucia di Lammermoor, Faust, Tannhäuser, Norma, Die Rose vom Liebesgarten, Pique-dame, Der Templer und die Jüdin, Rigoletto, Guillaume Tell, Le prophète, Manon, Le muette de Portici, Die Königin von Saba, Samson et Dalila, Götterdämmerung, Iphigénie en Tauride, Werther, and, in Italian, Tosca. Often regarded as a greater actor than singer, Schmedes appeared in two films, the more notable of which was Paul Czinner's 1919 silent Inferno, which is considered a lost film. Schmedes' last performance was in 1924 in the title role of Wilhelm Kienzl's Der Evangelimann. When he retired from the stage, he became a voice teacher in Vienna. Among his pupils were Maria Müller and Anny Konetzni. Erik Schmedes is a character in the 2012 novel, Death and the Maiden: A Max Liebermann Mystery, by Frank Tallis.

Most recently, it was in Earth orbit from September 2006 to June 2007. As a consequence of its temporary orbit around the Earth, it is currently the smallest asteroid in the Solar System with a well-known orbit. Until given a minor planet designation on 18 February 2008, the object was known as 6R10DB9, an internal identification number assigned by the Catalina Sky Survey.  Discovery  was discovered on 14 September 2006 by Eric Christensen with the Schmidt camera of the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona. \\"6R10DB9\\" was the Catalina Sky Survey's own discovery designation for this object, which usually would only be used on the MPC's NEO Confirmation Page (NEOCP) until an IAU designation was applied, if the object was classified as a minor object. It was added on 14 September to the NEOCP and subsequently removed with the explanation that it \\"was not a minor planet\\". Preliminary orbital calculations indicated it was captured by Earth's gravity from solar orbit of a period of about 11 months, which is similar to that of many spent rocket boosters dating to the Apollo program of the 1960s and early 1970s. 6R10DB was assigned the designation on 18 February 2008.  Origin  Some controversy existed regarding the origin of the object. Upon discovery, it was not given a formal name because its spectrum was consistent with the white titanium-oxide paint used on Saturn V rockets,Spectrum measured by Carl Hergenrother and Rob Whitely of the University of Arizona. which meant it could be an artificial object. Precedents for this exist: J002E3 is currently thought to be the third-stage Saturn S-IVB booster from Apollo 12 and was in an almost identical orbit, and 6Q0B44E, discovered a month earlier, was also thought to be artificial.The Guardian, Spacewatch, 6 September 2006 Its status as a satellite was also debated, with A. W. Harris of the Space Science Institute commenting, \\"Claiming some bit of fluff in a temporary looping orbit to be a 'satellite', with all the baggage that term carries, is mere hype\\".  Orbit  Analysis has shown that solar-radiation pressure is perturbing its motion perceptibly. However, Paul Chodas in JPL's Solar System Dynamics Group suspects that the perturbations are consistent with expectations for a rocky object but not with old flight hardware. One hypothesis is that the object is a piece of lunar rock ejected by an impact. On 18 February 2008, the object was given a minor planet designation. The object made four Earth orbits of about three months each before being ejected after the June 2007 perigee. At that perigee, it dipped inside the Moon's orbit to a distance of . became an Apollo-class asteroid in June 2007. Orbit of during a temporary-satellite- capture event  14 June 2007 perigee  On 14 June 2007, made its fourth and last perigee of the most recent Earth encounter.

The mandatory term of service was reduced from two years in 2007 and 2008.Army time cut to one year Russia Today Retrieved on April 28, 2008 Avoiding the draft is a felony under Russian criminal code and is punishable by up to 2 years of imprisonment. History Russian Empire and earlier times Prior to Peter I, the bulk of the military was formed from the nobility and people who owned land on condition of service. During wars additional recruiting of volunteers and ordinary citizens was common. Peter I introduced a regular army consisting of the nobility and recruits, including conscripts. The conscripts to the Imperial Russian Army were called \\"recruits\\" in Russia (not to be confused with voluntary recruitment, which did not appear until the early 20th century).Jerome Blum (1971) \\"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\\", , pp. 465,466 The system was called \\"recruit obligation\\" (). Russian tsars before Peter maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps (streltsy in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I formed the Imperial Russian Army built on the German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from nobility, as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers. The term of service in the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years. In 1834 it was reduced to 20 years plus 5 years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus 3 years of reserve. After the Russian defeat in the Crimean War during the reign of Alexander II, the Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin introduced military reforms, with an initial draft presented in 1862. On January 1, 1874 , a statute concerning conscription was approved by the Tsar by which military service was made compulsory for all males at the age of 21. The term of actual service was reduced for the land army to 6 years followed by 9 years in the reserve. This measure created a large pool of military reservists ready to be mobilized in the event of war, while permitting the maintenance of a smaller active army during peacetime. Most naval conscripts had an obligation for 7 years service, reflecting the more extended period required for technical training. Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I, the Imperial Government imposed compulsory service of three years for entrants to infantry and artillery regiments and four years for cavalry and engineers. After completing this initial period of full-time service, conscripts passed into the first class reserves for seven years. Final obligation for compulsory service ended at age 43, after eight years in the second reserves. The large population numbers available permitted military service exemptions on a larger scale than in other European armies of the period. Muslims, Finns and members of other minorities were generally exempted from conscription, as were about half of the Russian Christian population. Only sons were not normally required to serve. Early Soviet Russia and Soviet Union The first all-union conscription law of 1925 was tailored for the mixed cadre-militia structure of the peacetime Red Army after the Civil War. Draft-age was 21 years. Terms of service varied between one year in territorial formations and 2 to 4 years in the cadre army. Only \\"workers and peasants\\" were seen worthy to serve in combat units. Men of other social background were restricted to rear or labor services or had to pay a military tax. The 1936 Soviet Constitution declared the military service \\"sacred duty\\" of all Soviet citizens. Any reservations regarding social or national background were dropped. 1939 service law was promulgated with a lowered call-up age of 19 years. The Red army had adopted a full-cadre structure in the course of the 1930s. During the Great Patriotic War (World War II) all able-bodied men of ages 18–51 were subject to draft with the exception of specialists declared vitally necessary in industry, which was revamped for military/defense production. Post-World War II demobilisation of the Soviet Armed Forces was completed in 1948. According to the 1949 service law, service terms were 3 years in ground forces and 4 years in the navy. Late Soviet Union The late Soviet Armed Forces were manned by mandatory draft (with some exceptions) for all able-bodied males for 2 years (3 years for seagoing parts of the Navy and Border troops), based on the 1967 Law on Universal Military Service. A bi-annual call-up in spring and autumn was introduced then, replacing the annual draft in fall. The conscripts were normally sent to serve far away from their place of residence. Men were subject to draft at the age of 18. The draft could be postponed due to continued education. However since the early 1980s Soviet Union had the mandatory draft for students of the most of colleges/universities — the first mass student recruitment was in spring 1983, the maximum conscription fraction in 1987 — until it was abolished in the spring of 1989. Students were drafted for two or, if for the navy, three years of military service typically after termination (more seldom in the middle) of the first or second year of college. Most universities had an obligatory Military Chair which were in charge of military training of all able-bodied male students to become reserve officers of a particular military specialty depending on the university. Russian Federation The two-year conscription term in force in the USSR after 1967 continued in Russia following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union until 2006, when the Russian government and Duma gradually reduced the term of service to 18 months for those conscripted in 2007 and to one year from 2008, and dropped some legal excuses for non-conscription from the law (such as non- conscription of rural doctors and teachers, of men who have a child younger than 3 years, etc.) from 1 January 2008. Also full-time students who graduated from civil university and had military education were free from conscription from 1 January 2008.

It can also refer to any unit (for example, an aircraft or ship) performing a similar function. Origins Picket (Fr. piquet, a pointed stake or peg, from piquer, to point or pierce), is thought to have originated in the French army about 1690, from the circumstance that an infantry company on outpost duty dispersed its musketeers to watch, the small group of pikemen called piquet remaining in reserve.

In Years 3 to 5, units of work may take a language focus or be developed around a Science or Humanities and Social Science concept or topic. ICT is integrated in Junior School classrooms. In Middle School Year 6 and 7 students undertake a range of compulsory subjects which enable students to gain grounding in essential areas as well as experiencing the range of elective subjects the College offers. In Years 8 and 9, students can select from a range of specialist elective subjects. This helps them explore the options in preparation for Senior School. The Senior School (Years 10 to 12) curriculum provides an extensive range of subjects. In Years 11 and 12, students may pursue an academic program or a Vocational Education & Training program.  Co-curricular  Students (aged 14 and over) may choose to participate in The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards. The Redlands College Performance Music program, serving the Junior, Middle and Senior Schools comprises instrumental and vocal tuition; and instrumental and choral ensembles. Redlands College is a part of the Bayside District Sports association, which is a member of Metropolitan East School Sport.  Criticism  In 2014 Redlands College was criticised for requesting the transfer of practicum teachers on the basis of them wearing hijabs. In 2016 a former second grade teacher was jailed as a convicted pedophile; and a senator condemned the school for threatening a parent with a lawsuit, who requested detailed explanations as to why a year two teacher suddenly left the school. The staff member in question had resigned from the College prior to the College being informed of the allegations, which were already in the hands of the police. In 2017 a Report from the Committee of Privileges was entered into Hansard.

For example, the Logical disjunction function or with boolean values used for true (1) and false (0) is positive unate.

It is popular with beginners and escorted groups, as it offers straightforward caving, and it is possible to follow the cave from where a stream emerges at a small waterfall to a second entrance close to where it sinks further up the hill. It is a part of the Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description The main entrance is in a large collapsed depression, at the bottom of which is the scaffolded entrance to Great Douk Pot, and at the south-eastern end is the obvious entrance to the cave from which a waterfall issues. The cave can be entered by climbing up the waterfall, or crawling through an open bedding above. To the left, a low passage leads to where the Southerscales Pot stream flows out of a short sump. Straight on is easy walking, passing under Little Douk Pot, an alternative pothole entrance. Eventually a pleasant succession of cascades is met, and the passage passes through areas of fine flowstone. Soon after an oxbow passage, which by-passes a low crawl in the stream, the passage bifurcates. The main way is to the left, which lowers to a flat-out bedding with the main water entering from a small passage on the left. Straight ahead the passage chokes, but a hole in the roof enters a dry bedding which leads to a junction. Turning left leads to the Middle Washfold entrances. History Great Douk must have been known for a very long time, but the first reference to it may be found in John Hutton's Addendum to the second edition of West's Guide to the Lakes published in 1780. Hutton and party explored the cave for some beyond the Little Douk Pot window. Thereafter a visit to the entrance at least, seems to have been on every passing tourist's schedule, featuring, for example, in the 1853 edition of Garnett's Craven Itinerary. In 1850, Howson in his guidebook to Craven reported that it was possible to penetrate beyond Little Douk for \\"about seven hundred yards\\", and the Balderstons in Ingleton: Bygone and Present published in 1888 described how the cave can be explored to where \\"the subterranean river is found to have its branches like a subaerial stream\\" – i.e. to within a of the exit at Middle Washfold. The connection with Middle Washfold was made on 1 August 1936 by Norman Thornber and E.J. Douglas of the British Speleological Association and F. King of the Northern Cavern and Fell Club. The connection with Middle Washfold Sink was made by members of the University of Leeds Speleological Society (ULSA) in February 1966. The connection with Southerscales Pot was made in 1966 by members of the Cave Diving Group following the exploration of Southerscales Pot by ULSA. Etymology Douk features a number of times in the names of caves and locations in the Yorkshire Dales, including Low Douk on Ireby Fell, Douk Gill Cave near Horton in Ribblesdale, Dowkabottom Cave in Littondale, and High Douk Cave near Great Douk Cave. One meaning of the term offered by Smith in his 1961 The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, with reference to Dowkabottom, is \\"damp, wet, mist\\", but William Carr in an 1828 book on the dialect of Craven gives the meaning as \\"To bathe, to duck\\". The first known publication in which the cave was referred to as 'Great Douk Cave', as opposed to 'Douk Cave' as in earlier publications, was Harry Speight's 1892 The Craven and North-West Yorkshire Highlands, although William Stott Banks refers to \\"great and little Douk\\" in his 1866 Walks in Yorkshire.

He was named for Harry's brother, Lt. John Heth, who had also fought in the Revolutionary War and afterwards settled in the Richmond area. John Heth served in the volunteer forces of Virginia as an officer in the U.S. Navy in the War of 1812. On January 15, 1815, he was captured with Commodore Stephen Decatur Jr., the commander of the U.S. frigate President, and taken to Bermuda with Decatur and his crew as a prisoner of war. With two others, Captain Heth escaped from Bermuda in an open boat. Captain Heth married Margaret L. Pickett (1801-1850) of Richmond, Virginia on May 15, 1822. They had 11 children between 1823 and 1842, including future Confederate Major General Henry Heth, who was born at Black Heath in 1825.

Near his home, John Heth operated the Black Heath coal pits near present-day Midlothian, a business inherited from his father, who died in 1821. Under his management, the mines expanded and eventually became the standard coal of the US Navy. In 1832, he petitioned the Virginia General Assembly to form the first coal mining corporation in the state, and succeeded despite protests, the following year. After two serious fatal accidents from explosions in 1839 and 1844, the Black Heath pits were closed until 1938. John Heth died on April 30, 1842 at Norwood Plantation in Powhatan County, Virginia and was buried there.

The initialism TCB stands for Taking Care of Business, a personal motto Presley adopted in the early 1970s. Although personnel changed over the years, the original members were James Burton (lead guitar), Jerry Scheff (bass), John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar), Larry Muhoberac (keyboards) and Ron Tutt (drums). They first appeared live at Presley’s first Las Vegas performance at what was then known as the International Hotel (later the Las Vegas Hilton, now Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino) on July 31, 1969. History When planning his return to live performing after his successful 1968 NBC television comeback, Presley had to replace original band members Scotty Moore, D.J. Fontana (who had returned to session work) and Bill Black who had gone on to stardom with the Bill Black Combo before his death in 1965.http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/article_blackie.shtml “Blackie” Bill Black & Elvis, Arjan Deleen Elvis’ first call was to guitarist James Burton, who was from Ricky Nelson's band whom he asked to help form the group after knowing about him for many years and seeing on television. After keyboardist Glen D. Hardin declined Burton's offer to join the group, Larry Muhoberac, who had played on several of Presley's movie soundtrack sessions, accepted his offer to perform. Burton later added Jerry Scheff on bass and John Wilkinson on rhythm guitar. Muhoberac suggested Ron Tutt for the drums to round out the section.http://www.james-burton.net/elvis-presley James Burton website By February 1970, Glen D. Hardin joined on keyboards, eventually replacing Muhoberac who returned to studio work in Los Angeles.Note: Credits from February 1970 live album “In Person At The International Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada -LIVE-” list Hardin and Muhoberac on piano and organ respectively. RCA, ASIN: B000002WFC At that time Bob Lanning, a Los Angeles session drummer joined on drums, replacing Tutt who returned later that year. TCB brought a new lease of life to Elvis's rock 'n' roll sound of the 50s. Larrie Londin, a Nashville session drummer who recorded and occasionally toured with Presley over a nine-year period, filled in for Tutt on occasion during 1976 and 1977 performances.Uncredited, TCB Band-Larrie Londin-(Drums) ; Elvis Presley Music. Retrieved 2012-08-16. In 1975, Burton, Tutt and Muhoberac backed Johnny Cash on his album, John R. Cash. Tours with other musicians: After the TCB Band disbanded Before Presley's death in 1977, several former members from the TCB Band went on to form Emmylou Harris's Hot Band and The John Denver Band. These musicians include James Burton, Glen D. Hardin, Emory Gordy Jr. and Jerry Scheff. Burton left the Hot Band in 1976 and was replaced by English guitarist Albert Lee. Scheff was never a member of the Hot Band. Gordy left John Denver's band in 1980 (he re-joined the band and toured with John shortly in 1989) and was replaced by Scheff. Burton, Hardin and Scheff remained in John Denver's band until early 1994, and was then replaced by Pete Huttlinger, Chris Nole and Alan Deremo. After drumming a few years with the Jerry Garcia Band before Presley's death, Ron Tutt was invited by Neil Diamond to become Diamond's permanent concert and recording session drummer. Tutt's drumming has since become a feature to Diamond's concert shows, punctuating moments in the Diamond concert with his TCB Band style drum fills and cymbal crashes. Tutt is a workman celebrity drummer, and routinely receives concert crowd ovations when he appears and takes his seat at his drum kit. Noteworthy during concerts is Tutt's soaring drum work on the song, \\"Holly Holy\\". Tutt has been recording and touring with Diamond to the present day. Tutt also appears on several of recordings by Nancy Sinatra. Reunions (1979, 1981, 1987, 1997-present) The TCB Band reunited with a new lineup to record their own album in 1979 of covers of Elvis Presley songs as a tribute. They also reunited in 1981 as the backing band for Tony Sheridan, augmented by Klaus Voorman and again mostly featuring Sheridan's recordings of Elvis Presley songs. Several members of the TCB band (Glen Hardin on piano, James Burton on lead guitar, Jerry Scheff on upright bass, and Ron Tutt on drums) also played with Roy Orbison in his 1987 live performance Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night. Burton, Hardin, Scheff and Tutt reunited again in 1997 to perform Elvis: The Concert, with John Wilkinson rejoining for the 25th anniversary concert in Memphis. Since then, Burton, Hardin, Tutt and Scheff have toured frequently together, typically backing Austrian singer Dennis Jale and his band, mostly playing music from Elvis Presley’s catalogue. They have also backed Greg Page of the Wiggles for two solo albums and some live concerts. However, after the 30th anniversary concert in 2007, Scheff departed the band and was replaced on tour by Nathan East and Norbert Putnam. Wilkinson died on January 11, 2013, from cancer, at the age of 67. Putnam and East departed the band in 2013. The TCB Band currently continues to tour backing Dennis Jale and his band. In 2019, for the first time since 2014, the TCB Band will perform a new Elvis: The Concert-style show, alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, combining elements from the 2016-2018 Presley/Philharmonic tours with the old 1997-2014 TCB Band tours.https://www.graceland.com/elvis-uk-tour Members Current Members: * James Burton - lead guitar (1969-1977, 1979, 1981, 1987, 1997–present); vocals (1979) * Glen D.

Since they began in 1990, the Q Awards became one of Britain's biggest and best publicised music awards. Locations for the awards ceremony included Abbey Road Studios and, more recently, The Park Lane Ballroom. One of the more notable events of the awards was the ceremony of 2004, at which Elton John accused Madonna of cheating fans by miming on stage, after she had been nominated for a Best Live Act award. The 2001 event, was somewhat notoriously notable for Phill Jupitus stretching out the time it took to announce the \\"Best Producer\\" award, with him exclaiming \\"Best Producer?.... 'Would you like a cowbell in that?'\\", before being told off camera to get on with announcing the winner. The Q Awards included many awards recognising a lifetime of achievement, rather than achievements over the year in question. In its last few years, the 'lifetime' awards have usually outnumbered the 'current' awards. The awards came to an end when the magazine itself ceased publishing in 2020, blaming the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 awards ceremony would have been held at the Roundhouse and seen a performance by Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott.

Directors Peter Davidson After graduating from Bachelor of Architecture in 1980 from the NSW Institute of Technology, Sydney, Davidson moved to London in 1981 where he became editorial assistant for the journal International Architect. Whilst running his own practice for ten years, Davidson was also teaching at various institutions, including the Architectural Association School of Architecture where he met fellow design director of LAB Donald Bates. Davidson suffered a severe stroke in 2010 and has no involvement with Lab Architecture Studio. Donald Bates Donald Bates completed his bachelor's degree of Architecture in 1978 from the University of Houston, Texas and received his masters of Architecture in 1983 at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. Bates was the associate architect to Daniel Libeskind for the Berlin: city edge competition entry as well as the Berlin Museum extension Competition entry, now also known as the Jewish Museum Berlin. After business partner Peter Davidson suffered a severe stroke in 2010, Bates was accused of forgoing his partner's physical, emotional and financial well-being. Quoted in The Age, Nina Libeskind referred to Bates' \\"Cynical opportunism and expediency\\". In 2012 Bates was appointed chair of architectural design at the University of Melbourne.http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/comment/in-profile-donald- bates-from-lab-architecture-stud Awards  International awards  * Mipim AR Future Project Awards (2008) commended * FX International Interior Design awards London (2003) Best Museum category * Cityscape Architectural Review Awards (2007) Commercial Built + Community Future Categories - Shortlist * Kenneth Brown Award Hawaii (2003) Commendation for Asia Pacific Architecture * Urban Land Institute Award for Excellence: Asia Pacific USA (2005) Best Public Project * The Chicago Athenaeum International Architecture Awards USA (2006)  Australian awards  * RAIA National Award (2007) - International Architecture * RAIA National Awards (2003) *Interior Architecture Award *Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design * RAIA Victorian Awards (2003) *Victorian Architecture Medal *Marion Mahony Griffin Award for Interior Architecture *Melbourne Prize (2003) *Joseph Reed Award for Urban Design *New Award Australia * Interior Design Awards Australia (2003) * Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture (2003) — Award for Design Excellence * Dulux Interior Colour Award (2003) * Public Domain Award (2003) For Sustainability * Governor of Victoria Export Awards Commendee (2005) * Property Council of Australia — Victorian Division Australia (2005) — State winner of 2005 and Best Public Building * MBA National Building & Construction Awards (2006) — Export award under $25m * Australian Stone Architectural Awards — Best Civic Project (2006) Notable projects  Federation Square  Completed in 2002, Federation Square is situated on a 3.6 hectare corner site bound by Flinders and Swanston Streets in Melbourne, Australia. With a building footprint of 45,000 square metres the precinct incorporates commercial, civic and cultural programs.Federation Square: Lab Architecture Studio, ArcSpace.com, 28 April 2003. Retrieved 19 February 2013. Along with a wide variety of restaurants, bars and cafes and retail spaces larger institutions represented include the Ian Potter Centre (NGV), the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), Melbourne headquarters for SBS Television and the Melbourne Visitor Centre. In 1997 an international design competition was launched by the Victorian Government with a focus of creating new civic space for Melbourne, connecting Flinders Street to the Yarra River and enhancing the cultural attributes of the city. Five designs were shortlisted from the 177 entries. The winning design of Bates Smart Architects and Lab Studio Architects was announced in July 1997. The main plaza can accommodate up to 25000 people. The outdoor amphitheatre plays host to a variety of festivals and concerts as well as broadcasting cultural events such as the annual Tropfest and sporting events such as the AFL (Australian Football League) Grand Final. Federation Square was met with widespread disapproval, the architects receiving hate mail from people who loathed the design.Carly Crawford, 'Federation Square named among world's ugliest buildings on Virtual Tourist website', Herald Sun, 23 November 2009.

This is distinct from an oil depot, which does not have processing facilities. Typical oil well production fluids are a mixture of oil, gas and produced water. Many permanent offshore installations have full oil production facilities.Magnus Process Flow Diagrams 1983; NW Hutton Process Flow Diagrams 1987; Shearwater Process Flow Diagrams 2005 Smaller platforms and subsea wells export production fluids to the nearest production facility, which may be on a nearby offshore processing installation or an onshore terminal. The produced oil may sometimes be stabilised (a form of distillation) which reduces vapour pressure and sweetens \\"sour\\" crude oil by removing hydrogen sulphide, thereby making the crude oil suitable for storage and transport. Offshore processing The production plant can be considered to begin after the production wing valve on the oil well Christmas tree. The reservoir fluids from each well are piped through a flowline to a choke valve, which regulates the rate of flow and reduces the pressure of the fluids. The flowlines from each well are gathered together at an inlet manifold and routed into a (first stage) separator, which separates the three fluid phases. Produced water, the densest phase, settles out at the bottom of the separator, oil floats on the top of the produced water phase, and gas occupies the upper part of the separator. Two stage oil separation train Oil from the first stage separator may be cooled or heated in a heat exchanger to aid further separation. Oil is then routed either to a second stage separator, operating at a lower pressure than the first stage to further separate oil/gas/water, or to a coalescer to further remove water. Several stages of separation, operating at successively lower pressures, aim to reduce the amount of dissolved gas and hence reduces the flash point of the oil to meet the export oil specification. For higher oil flowrates parallel trains of separators may be necessary to handle the flow and to provide a turn-down capability. From the final stage of separation, or from the coaleser, oil may be cooled to meet export specifications and is metered to accurately measure the flowrate and then pumped via a pipeline to the onshore terminal. Some installations such as concrete gravity-base structures and FPSOs have integral oil storage tanks which are continuously filled with oil and periodically discharged into oil tankers. Produced water from the separator(s) or coalescer is routed to a produced water degasser operating at near atmospheric pressure to remove dissolved gas from the water. Produced water is then routed to a hydrocyclone to remove entrained oil and solids and then either re-injected into the reservoir or dumped overboard. For overboard disposal the water should have an oil content of less than about 30 parts per million (ppm) oil-in-water. In the early days of the offshore industry parallel plate separator units were used to clean produced water prior to overboard disposal. Hydrocyclones, which are more compact, were introduced in the 1980s. Parallel plate separator The associated gas from the top of the separator(s) is also known as flash gas or wet gas as it is saturated with water and liquid alkanes. The gas is typically routed through scrubbers, compressors and coolers to raise the pressure of the gas and to remove liquids. Gas may be dried by counter-current contact with triethylene glycol in a glycol dehydration tower. The dry gas may be exported, used for gas lift, flared, used as fuel for the installation's power generators, or after further compression re-injected into the reservoir. Expansion turbine Dry gas may be further treated to meet export gas specifications. Excess carbon dioxide (CO2) can be removed by treatment in an amine gas treating process, whereby CO2 is preferentially dissolved in a counter-current flow of amine in a contact tower. Hydrogen sulphide can also be removed using amine or by passing the gas through beds of zinc oxide absorbent. The export hydrocarbon dew-point specification (typically 100 barg at 5°C) may be met by chilling the gas to remove the higher alkanes (butane, pentanes, etc.). This may be done by a refrigeration system, or passing the gas through a Joule-Thomson valve, or through a turbo-expander to condense out and separate liquids. Export gas is metered to accurately measure the flowrate before being sent to the onshore terminal via gas pipeline. Condensed liquids from the gas treatment plant may be stabilised in a stabiliser (distillation) column to produce a gas product which can be co-mingled with the gas streams and natural gas liquids (NGL) which can be co-mingled with the oil export stream.  Onshore terminals  Onshore oil terminals generally have fired heaters followed by separators and coalescers to stabilise the crude and remove any produced water and light hydrocarbons not separated offshore. Onshore separators tend to operate at a lower pressure than the offshore separators and so more gas is evolved. The associated gas is generally compressed, dew-pointed and exported via a dedicated pipeline. If gas export is uneconomical then it may be flared. Onshore terminals frequently have large crude oil storage tanks to allow offshore production to continue if the export route becomes unavailable. Export to the oil refinery is either by pipeline or tanker. Onshore gas terminals may have facilities for removal of liquids from the incoming gas stream. Gas treatment processes may include glycol dehydration, gas sweetening, hydrocarbon dew-point control and gas compression before gas distribution to users.  Utility and support systems  In addition to production and gas and oil treatment systems a range of ancillary, support and utility systems are provided to support production and occupation of an offshore installation. Systems include: * Glycol regeneration - water- rich glycol is heated and stripped with dry gas to drive off the water * Amine regeneration - rich amine is heated and stripped with sweet gas to drive off CO2 and H2S * Fuel gas - used to power gas turbines, and to purge relief, vent and flare systems * Purge gas - to provide blanket gas for tanks and to purge vessels prior to maintenance * Inert gas - to provide blanket gas for tanks and to purge vessels prior to maintenance * Diesel fuel - for firewater pump diesel engines and start-up of generators * Aviation fuel - helicopter refuelling * Atmospheric vent - gas disposal for low pressure systems and maintenance purging * Relief and Flares - safe collection and disposal of excess gas under normal and shutdown conditions *Pipeline pigging - to clear and monitor pipelines * Well test facilities - test separator to determine flowrates from individual wells * Seawater - used for flushing, cooling, washdown * Firewater - seawater for fire fighting * Water injection - deaerated seawater injected into the oil reservoir to drive oil towards production wells and maintain reservoir pressure * Potable water - drinking water bunkered from supply vessels or made on board by reverse osmosis of seawater * Cooling medium - to cool gas and oil streams; comprising either seawater (direct) cooling or a fresh water/glycol mixture * Heating medium - to heat gas and oil streams, HVAC; comprising hot oil or a fresh water/glycol mixture * Closed (process) drains - to drain process equipment prior to maintenance * Open drains - drainage from deck areas, hazardous area drains are segregated from non-hazardous area drains, disposed overboard * Sewage treatment - maceration and overboard disposal of 'black' (toilet) and 'grey' (sink and shower) water * Plant/service air - for powering air-driven tools, purging vessels * Instrument air - for operating pneumatic actuated controllers and valves * Electricity generation - diesel or fuel gas for diesel engine or gas turbine driven electricity generation * Chemical storage and injection - to aid separation of well fluids and maintain operation of facilities, may include methanol, glycol, corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor, oxygen scavenger, H2S scavenger, emulsion breaker, foam breaker, wax inhibitor * Seal oil and lube oil storage - for compressors, gas turbines and diesel engines * Hydraulic oil - operation of subsea and subsurface well equipment * HVAC - for enclosed process plant and accommodation * Drilling facilities - bulk chemical storage, well drilling equipment See also *Petroleum *Oil platform *Oil industry *Upstream (oil industry) *Chemical plant *Oil refinery References Category:Petroleum production ","title":"Oil production plant"},{"id":"10980657","text":"Kittu () is a 2006 traditionally animated Indian feature film.

The station was initially opened as a relief station for the high-level terminus when it became unable to cope with the increasing demand. Between November 1872 and January 1874 the station, acting as a temporary terminus, handled traffic off the Enfield and Walthamstow lines.Walthamstow was the terminus of the Chingford branch at this time. Early in 1874 the first four platforms at Liverpool Street station opened, and Bishopsgate (Low Level) station became a normal through station. After the full opening of Liverpool Street in November 1875, the \\"high level\\" original Bishopsgate station closed to passengersSubterreanea Britannica: Bishopsgate station and the name of Bishopsgate (Low Level) was simplified to Bishopsgate. The high-level terminus reopened as a converted goods station in 1881 known as Bishopsgate goods yard, and had a subway linking it to the passenger station. Map of the Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street area, 1906 On 6 August 1889 there was an accident between Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street when a passenger service ran into the back of a stationary empty coaching stock train. An inquiry was unable to determine the exact cause of the crash due to conflicting witness statements. A further two running lines were added in 1891, and two platform faces subsequently added. A second ticket office was opened in Commercial Street to serve these platforms. These lines were built through the lower levels of the original Bishopsgate station. In November 1893 the station became one of the first on the Great Eastern Railway to be lit by electricity supplied by the company's nearby Norton Folgate power station. In 1902/3 the overall roofs were demolished and replaced by awnings. Bishopsgate station was closed on 22 May 1916 with other inner-suburban stations on the GER line through the East End of London. Today little remains of the low-level station except two derelict platforms, visible from trains on the approach into Liverpool Street main line station. The arches on the south platform were decorated in 2012 with panels displaying the flags of nations competing in the London Olympic Games that summer. In 2010 Shoreditch High Street railway station was opened on the East London line, parallel to, above, and immediately to the north of the old Bishopsgate station.

He was born at Lüthorst (by then a village of the Kingdom of Hanover), and was educated at the University of Göttingen (1824–27) and, after being a private tutor for some time, became, in 1829, \\"collaborator\\" at the Kreuzkirche in Hanover, where he was assistant pastor from 1837 until 1851, and senior pastor from 1851 until his death. During the years 1830–37 his convictions gradually changed from rationalistic to orthodox. His power as a preacher was especially shown by his Licht des Lebens (Hanover, 1858) and Salz der Erde (1864). For the improvement of the liturgy of his communion he wrote Bedürfnisse and Wünsche der protestantischen Kirche im Vaterland (Hanover, 1832); and still more important service was rendered by his edition of the Agende der hannoverschen Kirchenordnungen (1852). In behalf of religious instruction he wrote his Lehrbuch der Religion fur die oberen Klassen protestantischer Schulen (Hanover, 1839; 9th ed., 1888), and later collaborated on the ill-fated new catechism of 1862. He likewise conducted for many years the theological courses in the seminary for preachers at Hanover, and in 1837 founded in the same city an association for theological candidates, over which he presided until 1848. In 1845–47 he edited, together with Eduard Niemann, the periodical Segen der evangelischen Kirche, and in 1848–55 was editor of the Zeitblatt fur die Angelegenheiten der lutherischen Kirche. In 1842 he founded an annual conference of the Hanoverian Lutheran clergy; and in 1853, together with General Superintendent Steinmetz and August Friedrich Otto Münchmeyer, he established the well-known \\"Lutheran Poor-box\\" (Lutherischer Gotteskasten). At the same time, Petri was firmly opposed to any amalgamation of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches, and assumed an unfavorable position even toward the Inner Mission. In 1834 he helped to found the Hanoverian missionary society, of which he was first secretary and then president, while he materially aided the cause of foreign missions by his Die Mission and die Kirche (Hanover, 1841). His opposition to all movements in favor of a union of Lutherans and Reformed found renewed expression in his Beleuchtung der Göttinger Denkschrift zur Wahrung der evangelischen Lehrfreiheit (Hanover, 1854), an attack on the unionistic sympathies of the theological faculty of Göttingen. After this, Petri withdrew more and more from public life; and the only noteworthy work which he subsequently wrote was Der Glaube in kurzen Betrachtungen (4th ed., Hanover, 1875). He died at Hanover.

A separator for petroleum production is a large vessel designed to separate production fluids into their constituent components of oil, gas and water. A separating vessel may be referred to in the following ways: Oil and gas separator, Separator, Stage separator, Trap, Knockout vessel (Knockout drum, knockout trap, water knockout, or liquid knockout), Flash chamber (flash vessel or flash trap), Expansion separator or expansion vessel, Scrubber (gas scrubber), Filter (gas filter). These separating vessels are normally used on a producing lease or platform near the wellhead, manifold, or tank battery to separate fluids produced from oil and gas wells into oil and gas or liquid and gas. An oil and gas separator generally includes the following essential components and features: 1\\\\. A vessel that includes (a) primary separation device and/or section, (b) secondary “gravity” settling (separating) section, (c) mist extractor to remove small liquid particles from the gas, (d) gas outlet, (e) liquid settling (separating) section to remove gas or vapor from oil (on a three-phase unit, this section also separates water from oil), (f) oil outlet, and (g) water outlet (three-phase unit). 2\\\\. Adequate volumetric liquid capacity to handle liquid surges (slugs) from the wells and/or flowlines. 3\\\\. Adequate vessel diameter and height or length to allow most of the liquid to separate from the gas so that the mist extractor will not be flooded. 4\\\\. A means of controlling an oil level in the separator, which usually includes a liquid-level controller and a diaphragm motor valve on the oil outlet. 5\\\\. A back pressure valve on the gas outlet to maintain a steady pressure in the vessel. 6\\\\. Pressure relief devices. Separators work on the principle that the three components have different densities, which allows them to stratify when moving slowly with gas on top, water on the bottom and oil in the middle. Any solids such as sand will also settle in the bottom of the separator. The functions of oil and gas separators can be divided into the primary and secondary functions which will be discussed later on. Classification of oil and gas separators Classification by operating configuration Oil and gas separators can have three general configurations: vertical, horizontal, and spherical. Vertical separators can vary in size from 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet seam to seam (S to S) up to 10 or 12 feet in diameter and 15 to 25 feet S to S. Horizontal separators may vary in size from 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet S to S up to 15 to 16 feet in diameter and 60 to 70 feet S to S. Spherical separators are usually available in 24 or 30 inch up to 66 to 72 inch in diameter. Horizontal oil and gas separators are manufactured with monotube and dual-tube shells. Monotube units have one cylindrical shell, and dual-tube units have two cylindrical parallel shells with one above the other. Both types of units can be used for two-phase and three-phase service. A monotube horizontal oil and gas separator is usually preferred over a dual-tube unit. The monotube unit has greater area for gas flow as well as a greater oil/gas interface area than is usually available in a dual-tube separator of comparable price. The monotube separator will usually afford a longer retention time because the larger single-tube vessel retains a larger volume of oil than the dual-tube separator. It is also easier to clean than the dual-tube unit. In cold climates, freezing will likely cause less trouble in the monotube unit because the liquid is usually in close contact with the warm stream of gas flowing through the separator. The monotube design normally has a lower silhouette than the dual-tube unit, and it is easier to stack them for multiple-stage separation on offshore platforms where space is limited. It was illustrated by Powers et al (1990)Powers, Maston L., 1990. Analysis of Gravity Separation in Freewater Knockouts. SPE Production Engineering, [e-journal]5(1). Available through OnePetro database [Accessed 5 April 2011] that vertical separators should be constructed such that the flow stream enters near the top and passes through a gas/liquid separating chamber even though they are not competitive alternatives unlike the horizontal separators. Classification by function The three configurations of separators are available for two-phase operation and three-phase operation. In the two-phase units, gas is separated from the liquid with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold et al (2008).Arnold, Steward, 2008. Surface Production Operations. Design of Oil handling Sysytems and Facilities. Oxford: Gulf Professional Publishing. In three-phase separators, well fluid is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid separation section of the separator is determined by the maximum removal droplet size using the Souders–Brown equation with an appropriate K factor. The oil-water separation section is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience. In the case where the retention time is not available, the recommended retention time for three-phase separator in API 12J is used. The sizing methods by K factor and retention time give proper separator sizes. According to Song et al (2010),Joon H. Song, B. E. Jeong, H.J. Kim, S. S. Gil, 2010. Three-Phases Separator Sizing Using Drop Size Distribution. In: Offshore Technology Conference, 3–6 May 2010. Houston: Dawoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., LTD.. engineers sometimes need further information for the design conditions of downstream equipment, i.e., liquid loading for the mist extractor, water content for the crude dehydrator/desalter or oil content for the water treatment. Classification by operating pressure Oil and gas separators can operate at pressures ranging from a high vacuum to 4,000 to 5,000 psi. Most oil and gas separators operate in the pressure range of 20 to 1,500 psi. Separators may be referred to as low pressure, medium pressure, or high pressure. Low-pressure separators usually operate at pressures ranging from 10 to 20 up to 180 to 225 psi. Medium-pressure separators usually operate at pressures ranging from 230 to 250 up to 600 to 700 psi. High-pressure separators generally operate in the wide pressure range from 750 to 1,500 psi. Classification by application Oil and gas separators may be classified according to application as test separator, production separator, low temperature separator, metering separator, elevated separator, and stage separators (first stage, second stage, etc.). *Test separator: A test separator is used to separate and to meter the well fluids. The test separator can be referred to as a well tester or well checker. Test separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. They can be permanently installed or portable (skid or trailer mounted). Test separators can be equipped with various types of meters for measuring the oil, gas, and/or water for potential tests, periodic production tests, marginal well tests, etc. *Production separator: A production separator is used to separate the produced well fluid from a well, group of wells, or a lease on a daily or continuous basis. Production separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. Production separators range in size from 12 in. to 15 ft in diameter, with most units ranging from 30 in. to 10 ft in diameter. They range in length from 6 to 70 ft, with most from 10 to 40 ft long. *Low- temperature separator: A low-temperature separator is a special one in which high-pressure well fluid is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure reducing valve so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule–Thomson effect of expanding well fluid as it flows through the pressure- reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks. *Metering separator: The function of separating well fluids into oil, gas, and water and metering the liquids can be accomplished in one vessel. These vessels are commonly referred to as metering separators and are available for two-phase and three-phase operation. These units are available in special models that make them suitable for accurately metering foaming and heavy viscous oil. Primary functions of oil and gas separators Separation of oil from gas may begin as the fluid flows through the producing formation into the well bore and may progressively increase through the tubing, flow lines, and surface handling equipment. Under certain conditions, the fluid may be completely separated into liquid and gas before it reaches the oil and gas separator. In such cases, the separator vessel affords only an \\"enlargement\\" to permit gas to ascend to one outlet and liquid to descend to another. Removal of oil from gas Difference in density of the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons may accomplish acceptable separation in an oil and gas separator. However, in some instances, it is necessary to use mechanical devices commonly referred to as \\"mist extractors\\" to remove liquid mist from the gas before it is discharged from the separator. Also, it may be desirable or necessary to use some means to remove non solution gas from the oil before the oil is discharged from the separator. Removal of gas from oil The physical and chemical characteristics of the oil and its conditions of pressure and temperature determine the amount of gas it will contain in solution. The rate at which the gas is liberated from a given oil is a function of change in pressure and temperature. The volume of gas that an oil and gas separator will remove from crude oil is dependent on (1) physical and chemical characteristics of the crude, (2) operating pressure, (3) operating temperature, (4) rate of throughput, (5) size and configuration of the separator, and (6) other factors. Agitation, heat, special baffling, coalescing packs, and filtering materials can assist in the removal of nonsolution gas that otherwise may be retained in the oil because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. Gas can be removed from the top of the drum by virtue of being gas. Oil and water are separated by a baffle at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil- water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side. The two fluids can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle. The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated. The bulk level (gas–liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a coalescer to further reduce the water content. Separation of water from oil The production of water with oil continues to be a problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, separation of valuable hydrocarbons from disposable water has challenged and frustrated the oil industry. According to Rehm et al (1983),Rehm, S.J., Shaughnessy, R.J., III, C-E Natco, 1983. Enhanced Oil-Water Separation-The Performax Coalescer. In: SPE Production Operations Symposium. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 27 February – 1 March 1983. Oklahoma City: Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME. innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed coalescer and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate Coalescer, an enhanced gravity settling separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove water from the well fluid before it flows through pressure reductions, such as those caused by chokes and valves. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused downstream by the water, such as corrosion which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic surface. Corrosion is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into oil and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separate the water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed upstream or downstream of the separators. Secondary functions of oil and gas separators Maintenance of optimum pressure on separator For an oil and gas separator to accomplish its primary functions, pressure must be maintained in the separator so that the liquid and gas can be discharged into their respective processing or gathering systems. Pressure is maintained on the separator by use of a gas backpressure valve on each separator or with one master backpressure valve that controls the pressure on a battery of two or more separators. The optimum pressure to maintain on a separator is the pressure that will result in the highest economic yield from the sale of the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. Maintenance of liquid seal in separator To maintain pressure on a separator, a liquid seal must be effected in the lower portion of the vessel. This liquid seal prevents loss of gas with the oil and requires the use of a liquid-level controller and a valve. Methods used to remove oil from gas in separators Effective oil-gas separation is important not only to ensure that the required export quality is achieved but also to prevent problems in downstream process equipment and compressors. Once the bulk liquid has been knocked out, which can be achieved in many ways, the remaining liquid droplets are separated from by a demisting device. Until recently the main technologies used for this application were reverse-flow cyclones, mesh pads and vane packs. More recently new devices with higher gas-handling have been developed which have enabled potential reduction in the scrubber vessel size. There are several new concepts currently under development in which the fluids are degassed upstream of the primary separator. These systems are based on centrifugal and turbine technology and have additional advantages in that they are compact and motion insensitive, hence ideal for floating production facilities.Stewart, A.C., Chamberlain, N.P., Irshad, M., 1998. A New Approach to Gas–Liquid Separation. In: European Petroleum Conference. The Hague, Netherlands 20–22 October 1998. The Hague: Kvaerner Paladon Ltd. Below are some of the ways in which oil is separated from gas in separators. Density difference (gravity separation) Natural gas is lighter than liquid hydrocarbon. Minute particles of liquid hydrocarbon that are temporarily suspended in a stream of natural gas will, by density difference or force of gravity, settle out of the stream of gas if the velocity of the gas is sufficiently slow. The larger droplets of hydrocarbon will quickly settle out of the gas, but the smaller ones will take longer. At standard conditions of pressure and temperature, the droplets of liquid hydrocarbon may have a density 400 to 1,600 times that of natural gas. However, as the operating pressure and temperature increase, the difference in density decreases. At an operating pressure of 800 psig, the liquid hydrocarbon may be only 6 to 10 times as dense as the gas. Thus, operating pressure materially affects the size of the separator and the size and type of mist extractor required to separate adequately the liquid and gas. The fact that the liquid droplets may have a density 6 to 10 times that of the gas may indicate that droplets of liquid would quickly settle out of and separate from the gas. However, this may not occur because the particles of liquid may be so small that they tend to \\"float\\" in the gas and may not settle out of the gas stream in the short period of time the gas is in the oil and gas separator. As the operating pressure on a separator increases, the density difference between the liquid and gas decreases. For this reason, it is desirable to operate oil and gas separators at as low a pressure as is consistent with other process variables, conditions, and requirements. Impingement If a flowing stream of gas containing liquid, mist is impinged against a surface, the liquid mist may adhere to and coalesce on the surface. After the mist coalesces into larger droplets, the droplets will gravitate to the liquid section of the vessel. If the liquid content of the gas is high, or if the mist particles are extremely fine, several successive impingement surfaces may be required to effect satisfactory removal of the mist. Change of flow direction When the direction of flow of a gas stream containing liquid mist is changed abruptly, inertia causes the liquid to continue in the original direction of flow. Separation of liquid mist from the gas thus can be effected because the gas will more readily assume the change of flow direction and will flow away from the liquid mist particles. The liquid thus removed may coalesce on a surface or fall to the liquid section below. Change of flow velocity Separation of liquid and gas can be effected with either a sudden increase or decrease in gas velocity. Both conditions use the difference in inertia of gas and liquid. With a decrease in velocity, the higher inertia of the liquid mist carries it forward and away from the gas.changent, 2008. Production Separator Principles – sample[video online] Available at: [Accessed 10 April 2011] The liquid may then coalesce on some surface and gravitate to the liquid section of the separator. With an increase in gas velocity, the higher inertia of the liquid causes the gas to move away from the liquid, and the liquid may fall to the liquid section of the vessel. Centrifugal force If a gas stream carrying liquid mist flows in a circular motion at sufficiently high velocity, centrifugal force throws the liquid mist outward against the walls of the container. Here the liquid coalesces into progressively larger droplets and finally gravitates to the liquid section below. Centrifugal force is one of the most effective methods of separating liquid mist from gas. However, according to Keplinger (1931),Keplinger, 1931. Physical Problems in the Separation of Oil and Gas. Proceedings of the Oklahoma, University of Tulsa, Volume VI, pp. 74–75. some separator designers have pointed out a disadvantage in that a liquid with a free surface rotating as a whole will have its surface curved around its lowest point lying on the axis of rotation. This created false level may cause difficulty in regulating the fluid level control on the separator. This is largely overcome by placing vertical quieting baffles which should extend from the bottom of the separator to above the outlet. Efficiency of this type of mist extractor increases as the velocity of the gas stream increases. Thus for a given rate of throughput, a smaller centrifugal separator will suffice. Methods used to remove gas from oil in separators Because of higher prices for natural gas, the widespread reliance on metering of liquid hydrocarbons, and other reasons, it is important to remove all nonsolution gas from crude oil during field processing. Methods used to remove gas from crude oil in oil and gas separators are discussed below: Agitation Moderate, controlled agitation which can be defined as movement of the crude oil with sudden force is usually helpful in removing nonsolution gas that may be mechanically locked in the oil by surface tension and oil viscosity. Agitation usually will cause the gas bubbles to coalesce and to separate from the oil in less time than would be required if agitation were not used. Heat Heat as a form of energy that is transferred from one body to another results in a difference in temperature. This reduces surface tension and viscosity of the oil and thus assists in releasing gas that is hydraulically retained in the oil. The most effective method of heating crude oil is to pass it through a heated-water bath. A spreader plate that disperses the oil into small streams or rivulets increases the effectiveness of the heated-water bath. Upward flow of the oil through the water bath affords slight agitation, which is helpful in coalescing and separating entrained gas from the oil. A heated-water bath is probably the most effective method of removing foam bubbles from foaming crude oil. A heated-water bath is not practical in most oil and gas separators, but heat can be added to the oil by direct or indirect fired heaters and/or heat exchangers, or heated free-water knockouts or emulsion treaters can be used to obtain a heated-water bath. Centrifugal force Centrifugal force which can be defined as a fictitious force, peculiar to a particle moving on a circular path, that has the same magnitude and dimensions as the force that keeps the particle on its circular path (the centripetal force) but points in the opposite direction is effective in separating gas from oil. The heavier oil is thrown outward against the wall of the vortex retainer while the gas occupies the inner portion of the vortex. A properly shaped and sized vortex will allow the gas to ascend while the liquid flows downward to the bottom of the unit. Flow measurements in oil and gas separators The direction of flow in and around a separator along with other flow instruments are usually illustrated on the Piping and instrumentation diagram, (P&ID;). Some of these flow instruments include the Flow Indicator (FI), Flow Transmitter (FT) and the Flow Controller (FC). Flow is of paramount importance in the oil and gas industry because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan et al (1999) Ram S. Mohan, Ovadia Shoham, 1999. Design and Development of Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone Compact Separators for Three-Phase Flow. In: Oil and Gas Conference – Technology Options for Producers' Survival, Dallas, Texas 28–30 June 1999. Dallas: DOE and PTTC carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow behaviour in a three- phase oil and gas separator. A mechanistic model was developed alongside a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator. The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the mechanistic model. The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well. Flow calibration in oil and gas separators As earlier stated, flow instruments that function with the separator in an oil and gas environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration can be defined as the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined with the use of a master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989),Ting, V.C., Halpine, J.C., 1989. Portable Piston Gas Prover for Field Calibration of Flowmeters. SPE Production Engineering, 6(4), pp. 454–458. transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000),Jesse Yoder, 2000. Flowmeter Calibration: How, Why, and Where. Control for the Process Industries. Houston: Putman Media. the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.Jesse Yoder, 2000. Flowmeter Calibration: How, Why, and Where. Control for the Process Industries. Houston: Putman Media. In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale. Controls, valves, accessories, and safety features for oil and gas separators Controls The controls required for oil and gas separators are liquid level controllers for oil and oil/water interface (three-phase operation) and gas back-pressure control valve with pressure controller. Although the use of controls is expensive making the cost of operating fields with separators so high, installations has resulted in substantial savings in the overall operating expense as in the case of the 70 gas wells in the Big Piney, Wyo sighted by Fair (1968).R. A. Fair, 1968. Gas-field Telemetering and Remote Control, Big Piney, Wyoming. Drilling and Production Practice, 1968. Houston: American Petroleum Institute. The wells with separators were located above 7,200 ft elevation, ranging upward to 9,000 ft. Control installations were sufficiently automated such that the field operations around the controllers could be operated from a remote-control station at the field office using the Distributed Control System. All in all, this improved the efficiency of personnel and the operation of the field, with a corresponding increase in production from the area. Valves The valves required for oil and gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain valves, block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.Sadoun Mutar Bezea Al-Khaledi, Naser Abdulaziz, Dwaipayan Bora, 2011. Replacement of Existing ESD Valves with New SIL Rated ESD Valves: A Case Study of Production Optimization and Enhancement of Process Safety and Integrity in Kuwait Oil Company. In: SPE Project and Facilities Challenges Conference Doha, Qatar 13–16 February 2011. Doha: Kuwait Oil Company. Accessories The accessories required for oil and gas separators are pressure gauges, thermometers, pressure-reducing regulators (for control gas), level sight glasses, safety head with rupture disk, piping, and tubing. Safety features for oil and gas separators Oil and gas separators should be installed at a safe distance from other lease equipment. Where they are installed on offshore platforms or in close proximity to other equipment, precautions should be taken to prevent injury to personnel and damage to surrounding equipment in case the separator or its controls or accessories fail. The following safety features are recommended for most oil and gas separators. *High- and low-liquid-level controls: High- and low liquid-level controls normally are float-operated pilots that actuate a valve on the inlet to the separator, open a bypass around the separator, sound a warning alarm, or perform some other pertinent function to prevent damage that might result from high or low liquid levels in the separator. *High- and low-pressure controls: High- and low pressure controls are installed on separators to prevent excessively high or low pressures from interfering with normal operations. These high- and low-pressure controls can be mechanical, pneumatic, or electric and can sound a warning, actuate a shut-in valve, open a bypass, or perform other pertinent functions to protect personnel, the separator, and surrounding equipment. *High- and low-temperature controls: Temperature controls may be installed on separators to shut in the unit, to open or to close a bypass to a heater, or to sound a warning should the temperature in the separator become too high or too low. Such temperature controls are not normally used on separators, but they may be appropriate in special cases. According to Francis (1951), low-temperature controls in separators is another tools used by gas producers which finds its application in the high-pressure gas fields, usually referred to as \\"vapour-phase\\" reservoirs. Low temperatures obtainable from the expansion of these high- pressure gas streams are utilized to a profitable advantage. A more efficient recovery of the hydrocarbon condensate and a greater degree of dehydration of the gas as compared to the conventional heater and separator installation is a major advantage of low-temperature controls in oil and gas separators.A. W. Francis, 1951. Low-Temperature Separation as Applied to Gas-Condensate Production. Drilling and Production Practice, 1951. Houston: American Petroleum Institute. *Safety relief valves: A spring-loaded safety relief valve is usually installed on all oil and gas separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel. Safety relief valves serve primarily as a warning, and in most instances are too small to handle the full rated fluid capacity of the separator. Full-capacity safety relief valves can be used and are particularly recommended when no safety head (rupture disk) is used on the separator. *Safety heads or rupture disks: A safety head or rupture disk is a device containing a thin metal membrane that is designed to rupture when the pressure in the separator exceeds a predetermined value. This is usually from 1 1/4 to 1% times the design pressure of the separator vessel. The safety head disk is usually selected so that it will not rupture until the safety relief valve has opened and is incapable of preventing excessive pressure buildup in the separator. Operation and maintenance considerations for oil and gas separators Over the life of a production system, the separator is expected to process a wide range of produced fluids. With break through from water flood and expanded gas lift circulation, the produced fluid water cut and gas-oil ratio is ever changing. In many instances, the separator fluid loading may exceed the original design capacity of the vessel. As a result, many operators find their separator no longer able to meet the required oil and water effluent standards, or experience high liquid carry-over in the gas according to Power et al (1990).Powers, Choi, M.S., 1990. Prediction of Separator Performance Under Changing Field Conditions. In: SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, New Orleans, Louisiana 23–26 September 1990. New Orleans: Conoco Inc. Some operational maintenance and considerations are discussed below: Periodic inspection In refineries and processing plants, it is normal practice to inspect all pressure vessels and piping periodically for corrosion and erosion. In the oil fields, this practice is not generally followed (they are inspected at a predetermined frequency, normally decided by an RBI assessment) and equipment is replaced only after actual failure. This policy may create hazardous conditions for operating personnel and surrounding equipment. It is recommended that periodic inspection schedules for all pressure equipment be established and followed to protect against undue failures. Installation of safety devices All safety relief devices should be installed as close to the vessel as possible and in such manner that the reaction force from exhausting fluids will not break off, unscrew, or otherwise dislodge the safety device. The discharge from safety devices should not endanger personnel or other equipment. Low temperature Separators should be operated above hydrate-formation temperature. Otherwise hydrates may form in the vessel and partially or completely plug it thereby reducing the capacity of the separator. In some instances when the liquid or gas outlet is plugged or restricted, this causes the safety valve to open or the safety head to rupture. Steam coils can be installed in the liquid section of oil and gas separators to melt hydrates that may form there. This is especially appropriate on low-temperature separators. Corrosive fluids A separator handling corrosive fluid should be checked periodically to determine whether remedial work is required. Extreme cases of corrosion may require a reduction in the rated working pressure of the vessel. Periodic hydrostatic testing is recommended, especially if the fluids being handled are corrosive. Expendable anode can be used in separators to protect them against electrolytic corrosion. Some operators determine separator shell and head thickness with ultrasonic thickness indicators and calculate the maximum allowable working pressure from the remaining metal thickness. This should be done yearly offshore and every two to four years onshore.

It was hosted by Carly Flynn and Brooke Howard-Smith. The show ran for 11 seasons and remained one of New Zealand's highest rated factual programs and had won one Qantas Media Award. The show has been off the air since 2013. Former hosts included Leanne Malcolm, Ian Orchard, Greg Boyed and Janet Wilson. Current features on the show Hidden camera trials This has been a major part of the show since the launch of Target in 1999. It is used to reveal Trades People and Shops misconduct and illegal behaviour including urinating in showers. =Retail trials= In these trials often young actors under the age of 18 are sent into a store to purchase an item restricted to persons aged 18 or over, such as cigarettes, pornographic material and alcohol. The actor is given an expired EFTPOS card or less change than required to purchase the item, so they do not purchase the items in question. This is largely done to prevent Target from being sued by retailers in relation to a prosecution stemming the hidden camera trial, and in alcohol trials also prevents the actor being liable for prosecution (under the Sale of Liquor Act 1989, a person under 18 who purchases alcohol is liable for a fine up to $2000.) In 2009 Christchurch liquor trial, there was a record broken for the youngest ever actor used in the trial: 10 years old, and she was allowed to buy alcohol. =Hidden camera house trials= Target have their own Hidden Camera house which is located in a different area of New Zealand each season. The house has Hidden Cameras throughout and is used to send various tradesmen there to carry out work, the tradesmen being left in the home alone while the occupant of the house goes out. Jobs can range from repairing appliances in the home, to building, electrical or plumbing work. The test is not only to see the standard of the work carried out but also the actions of the worker, whether he/she wanders into rooms of the house he/she has no reason to be in and whether the worker acts in a professional manner. In March 2011, The house that Target uses for filming in Tauranga was uncovered by an electrician who had been called to fit a power point in the bedroom. The electrician started the job but quickly suspected something was out of the ordinary when he noticed a diary lying open next to where he was working, bikinis on the bed, and photographs of women. He also found a hidden camera in a smoke alarm. He left the job immediately and phoned his lawyer who advised him not to continue. This event has not aired yet.http://www.bayofplentytimes.co.nz/local/news/target-filming-angers- tradesman/3943178/ In May 2012 a Hidden Camera trial was aired revealing a carpet cleaner performing an indecent act in the actor's home. Within minutes of the occupant leaving the house the tradesman was filmed sniffing various items of clothing in a laundry basket and later spraying perfume onto a pair of woman's underwear. He then turns on the household computer visiting a pornography website and begins masturbating into a pair of the actor's underwear. The tradesman performs this act at least twice during the segment. This particular episode focused around this one hidden camera trial with trials of other carpet cleaners not aired. Neither the company the carpet cleaner worked for was named nor was the tradesman. The matter was referred to the New Zealand Police and the tradesman was charged with burglary and wilfully accessing a computer. The tradesman was fired from his job and granted name suppression.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/6933057/Target- carpet-cleaner-in-court =Restaurant trials= Some trials have involved an actor visiting a restaurant or other food service place and while dining there taking a sample of the food purchased. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis. Also the standard of the service is examined and any hygiene practices. The 16 June 2009 edition of the consumer show featured a hidden camera segment assessing the hygiene standards of eight Auckland cafes, and claimed chicken from Cafe Cézanne contained high levels of faecal coliforms. TV3 released a statement on behalf of production company Top Shelf Productions admitting food samples from the cafes were incorrectly coded and they were unable to confirm which one had produced the contaminated food. Subsequently to this the owners of Cafe Cézanne has started legal proceedings against Top Shelf Productions. =Service/repair trials= These trials were more common in the earlier seasons. A fault is created in an appliance such as a TV set, Microwave, DVD player and the item is then taken to repair outlets. When the appliance is returned to the actor the presenters then check to see whether the appliance has actually been repaired and the standard of the repair, as well as the time taken to repair the appliance and the cost. =Other trials= The other trials have included taxis, LPG bottle fills, Children's visits to Santa (2006 Christmas Special) and standards of services such as public toilets. Product check Every week the Target test family test a chosen product. In this test about 5 brands of a particular product are tested by the family. The test is done by placing each brand on a colour-coded dish with the members of the family not known what brand they are testing. Food items are usually taken to a lab to run other tests on the product as well. The test family are used for most product checks however for some products a group of students or experts in a particular industry may be used. The test family changes every year and is typically a nuclear family with mostly teenage children. The first, and most well recognized Test Family were the Coombs, who were the Test Family for three years. Shame on you Introduced in the 2007 Series, Brooke follows up on personal stories by consumers that have been ripped off, poorly dealt with or misled about a certain product. Some stories are not hard luck stories but just stories that cover wider issues and interviewing experts or affected parties. The dodgy operator is named. What's up with that? An occasional feature on the show. What's up with that? looks at issues consumers may face. An example was one week a segment was covered on paying a fee for a cancelled appointment. Another example was retailers selling items marked as 'Not for Individual Sale' individually. Past features on the show Seconds Anyone Part of the 2008 series, each week Jeanette looked at buying a particular item second hand. An expert told consumers what to look for, how much to expect to pay and which brands were the best to choose from. Things That Hack You Off This was a segment in the 2006 Series, this segment covered anything that most likely 'Hacked' the consumer off, from slow service or poor service to parking fines. Know Your Rights This was regular segment in all of the earlier seasons from 1999 to 2003. A role play was done with two actors who would get into a different situation each week and would then ask what their rights were in this situation, the screen would then cut to David Russell from the Consumers Institute where David would explain what the consumers rights were in this situation. The role play would continue and as various points were raised once again David would explain the consumers rights in the situation. In the early seasons of Target, the show partnered with the Consumer's Institute, offering discounted Consumer magazine subscriptions. Apologies In June 2009 Target apologized to Ponsonby's Cafe Cézanne for airing a report Target was unable to verify that accused Cézanne of selling food contaminated with fecal coliform. In September 2009 Target apologized for incorrectly calling the Pakuranga Lotto shop the Lucky lotto shop.

In 1884 he became one of the first doctors to surgically remove a brain tumor, founding modern brain surgery. Early life Godlee was born at Upton, Essex to a Quaker family, the second son of Rickman Godlee (1804–1871), a barrister at Middle Temple, and Mary Godlee (née Lister), daughter of Joseph Jackson Lister. He was thus a nephew of Joseph Lister — whose biography he later wrote. NB. Disputed birth place - Although both Wikipedia & his death announcement in newspaper article's of the time say that he was born at Upton, Essex both the 1911 census (completed by him) and the UK GRO birth record give his pace of birth as BLOOMSBURY. He was educated at a school in Tottenham and took his B.A. at the University College, London before he began his medical education. An expert draughtsman, and whilst still at the University College, London, he was employed to make the original plates for Quain's Anatomy — which in 1920 he presented to the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Medical career He was admitted a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1872, and four years later was elected to the fellowship — having in the meantime won gold medal at both his Bachelor and Master of Surgery examinations at the University of London. After a periods as house surgeon then house physician at University College Hospital, London, he moved to Edinburgh to practise the new surgical techniques being developed there by his uncle, Joseph Lister. On his return to London he was appointed assistant surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, and to a similar position at the North Eastern Hospital for Children. After a period as assistant surgeon at University College Hospital, he became surgeon at Brompton Hospital, London, where he made advances in surgery of the chest. At the Epileptic Hospital, Regent's Park on 25 November 1884 he became the first to perform a surgical primary (exposed) removal of a brain tumor after physician Alexander Hughes Bennett (1848-1901) diagnosed the location using neurological findings alone. In 1885 he was appointed surgeon at University College Hospital, and Emeritus Professor of Clinical Surgery there in 1892. He served as President of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1911 to 1913 and of the Royal Society of Medicine from 1916 to 1918. He was appointed Surgeon to the Household of Queen Victoria and Surgeon Ordinary to Edward VII and to George V, created a baronet 'of Whitchurch in the County of Oxford' on 6 July 1912 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1914 New Year Honours. Family life He married Juliet Mary Seebohm, a daughter of Frederic Seebohm, in 1891. After his retirement in 1920 they moved from London to Coombe End, Whitchurch-on-Thames, Berkshire, where he died at the age of 76 on 18 April 1925. A tribute in The Times The author of his obituary in The Times wrote: Rickman Godlee was a remarkable man. His Quaker upbringing and ancestry left their marks upon him. Scrupulously honest in thought and conscientious in detail, he took nothing for granted that he had not himself investigated. Quiet in manner, reserved in character, and rather sarcastic, he was apt to be under-estimated in early life by those who only knew him superficially. His sterling worth came to be recognised later, and he showed himself a firm but dignified and courteous ruler during his term of office as President of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was not only a good surgeon and a fine artist, but he was a linguist, a carpenter, a poet, a botanist, an ornithologist, and an oarsman, while his great knowledge of books made him an admirable honorary librarian at the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society of Medicine. … Lister's Life could only have been written by Godlee, whose veneration for his uncle was unbounded. He alone knew the minute details of his life and practice, for as a young man he was usually left in charge of the patients on whom Lister had operated in private. With access to his papers and letters, and from personal recollections, he could remember the simple life led by members of the Society of Friends, which is so charming a feature of his Life of Lord Lister.

The government has banned most independent and opposition newspapers from being distributed by the state-owned postal and kiosk systems, forcing the papers to sell directly from their newsrooms and use volunteers to deliver copies, but authorities sometimes harass and arrest the private distributors. The Russian media is allowed to transmit television programming, sell newspapers and conduct journalistic activities in Belarus (though some Russian journalists have been expelled by the Belarusian government), thus giving some members of the public, typically those in large cities with many Russian residents, access to an alternative point of view in the Russian language (nearly all Belarusians understand and most of them speak Russian). Several opposition media outlets broadcast from nearby countries to provide Belarusians alternative points of view. This includes the Belsat TV station and European Radio for Belarus (Eŭrapéjskaje Rádyjo dla Biełarúsi).\\"Dissent hits Belarus via Warsaw\\", Gordon Fairclough, Wall Street Journal, 29 January 2011 In 2014-2015, dozens of freelance journalists were fined for working with foreign media (including Belarusian-language media based in the EU) without official state accreditation from the Foreign Ministry, as foreseen by Article 22.9(2) of the Belarusian Code on Administrative Offence. Journalists were fined several hundreds of euros for having published through foreign media, rather than based on the content of their work. Computer equipments were also seized. The journalists fined had published on Polish-based Belsat TV, Deutsche Welle. Procedural guarantees, including the hearing of witnesses in court, were reportedly not followed by Belarusian authorities, but appeals were rejected. The prosecution of freelancers was condemned by the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ), which deemed it a gross violation of the standards of freedom of expression, as well as by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and by the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ).

The last time he was seen was at the Minsk National Airport. On March 14, 2002 Valery Ignatovich and Maxim Malik, former members of a special police unit, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his abduction. His family claimed that real responsibility lay with the government (the same claim was made by two former employees of the Prosecutor General's Office and was validated by the United States Department of State) and that they were just scapegoats. He was declared dead on November 28, 2003. * Mykhailo Kolomyets, founder of the Ukrainian News Agency was found hanged near Maladzyechna on October 30, 2002. * Veronika Cherkasova, a reporter for Solidarnost, was stabbed to death in her apartment in Minsk on October 20, 2004. * Vasily Grodnikov, a journalist working for Narodnaja Volya, was found dead with a head wound in his apartment in Minsk on October 17, 2005. * Aleh Byabenin, founder of Charter 97, was found hanged on September 3, 2010, in an area outside Minsk. While authorities claimed it was a suicide, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) considered it reasonably certain that he was murdered in direct reprisal for his journalistic work. Self-censorship The Ministry of Information gave warning to 34 media outlets in 2015 alone. Since an outlet receiving two note in a year can be closed this is seen as a way to encourage self-censorship by the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ). Another thing that pushes journalists to self-censorship is the enormous amount of the defamation fines and payments to officials that can be inflicted by courts. In 2010 the President issued the decree #60 which \\"provides for registration of all Internet resources, creation of black lists of the web- sites access to which should be blocked, and a number of other restrictive measure\\". Even if not all of them are used, after that \\"some popular Internet- media became more cautious and softened their criticism of the government\\".  Internet censorship  In 2006, 2007, and 2008 Reporters Without Borders (RWB) listed Belarus as an \\"Internet enemy\\". In 2009 Belarus moved to RWB's countries \\"under surveillance\\" list where it remained in 2010 and 2011.\\"Countries under surveillance: Belarus\\" , Reporters Without Borders, March 2011 In 2012 Belarus was moved back to the RWB list of Internet Enemies.Internet Enemies , Reporters Without Borders (Paris), 12 March 2012 The OpenNet Initiative classified Internet filtering in Belarus as selective in the political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas in November 2010. The Belarus government has moved to second- and third- generation controls to manage its national information space. Control over the Internet is centralized with the government-owned Beltelecom managing the country's Internet gateway. Regulation is heavy with strong state involvement in the telecommunications and media market. Most users who post online media practice a degree of self-censorship prompted by fears of regulatory prosecution. The president has established a strong and elaborate information security policy and has declared his intention to exercise strict control over the Internet under the pretext of national security. The political climate is repressive and opposition leaders and independent journalists are frequently detained and prosecuted.\\"ONI Country Profile: Belarus\\", OpenNet Initiative, 18 November 2010 A new media law that took effect in February 2009 requires domestic and international websites to register with the Information Ministry or be blocked. In August 2010, the Prosecutor General's Office announced its intention to toughen criminal penalties for the dissemination of slanderous information through the Internet. Since 2007, Internet cafe owners have been required to keep records of their customers’ identities and the websites they visit, facilitating inspection by the security services. On January 6, 2012, a law took effect requiring that all commercial websites selling goods or services to Belarusian citizens to be operated from within the country and under a .by domain name. Moreover, those who provide internet access (including ISPs and Wi-Fi hotspot operators) must register all users, and they must also censor websites on a blacklist covering pornography and other extremist websites. Bloggers and online journalism used to be almost free, although limited to a very narrow audience; the government has started censoring the web too, since internet penetration has started growing. * In March 2014 Beltelecom blocked the Nasha Niva newspaper website – possibly as a test for the upcoming 2015 presidential elections. On August 8, 2020, the Internet site afn.by (Agency of Financial News) was blocked by the Ministry of Information for unknown reasons.Мининформ распорядился заблокировать новостной сайт afn.by On August 9, 2020, during the 2020 Belarusian presidential election and later, protests against Lukashenko-reelection, the Internet in Belarus was partially blocked. According to the government officials, the reason was heavy DDoS-attack, but the independent IT specialists claimed that Belarusian state Internet monopolyBeltelecom holds the monopoly to send traffic to other countries, and other providers have to use its channels. Beltelecom and affiliated state agencies deliberately used Deep packet inspection (DPI) technology or traffic shaping.Что происходит с интернетом в Беларуси — мнение технических специалистов On 21 August, 72 or 73 web sites were blocked in Belarus, including several independent news portals (Radio Liberty/Free Europe in Belarus svaboda.org, by.tribuna.com sport news, euroradio.fm, belsat.eu, gazetaby.com, the-village.me/news and others), electoral sites of Tsepkalo and Babaryko, \\"Golos\\" and \\"Zubr\\" platforms, spring96.org human rights portal, several VPN services.В Беларуси ограничили доступ к ряду сайтов.

The block extended within 2015.  Music censorship  In the past few years, many Belarusian musicians and rock bands have been unofficially banned from radio and television, have had their concert licenses revoked, and have had their interviews censored in the media. Researchers Maya Medich and Lemez Lovas reported in 2006 that \\"independent music-making in Belarus today is an increasingly difficult and risky enterprise\\", and that the Belarusian government \\"puts pressure on ‘unofficial’ musicians - including ‘banning’ from official media and imposing severe restrictions on live performance.\\" Belarus government policies tend to divide Belarusian musicians into pro-government \\"official\\" and pro-democracy \\"unofficial\\" camps. Economic barriers have been placed against various artists, leading to self-censorship.

A van der Waals molecule is a weakly bound complex of atoms or molecules held together by intermolecular attractions such as van der Waals forces or by hydrogen bonds. The name originated in the beginning of the 1970s when stable molecular clusters were regularly observed in molecular beam microwave spectroscopy.  Examples  Examples of well-studied vdW molecules are Ar2, H2-Ar, H2O-Ar, benzene-Ar, (H2O)2, and (HF)2. Others include the largest diatomic molecule: He2 and LiHe.  Supersonic beam spectroscopy  In (supersonic) molecular beams temperatures are very low (usually less than 5 K). At these low temperatures van der Waals (vdW) molecules are stable and can be investigated by microwave, far-infrared spectroscopy and other modes of spectroscopy. Also in cold equilibrium gases vdW molecules are formed, albeit in small, temperature dependent concentrations. Rotational and vibrational transitions in vdW molecules have been observed in gases, mainly by UV and IR spectroscopy. Van der Waals molecules are usually very non-rigid and different versions are separated by low energy barriers, so that tunneling splittings, observable in far-infrared spectra, are relatively large. Thus, in the far- infrared one may observe intermolecular vibrations, rotations, and tunneling motions of van der Waals molecules. The VRT spectroscopic study of Van der Waals molecules is one of the most direct routes to the understanding of intermolecular forces.  See also  * Donald Levy * Richard J.

He was born Ernst Schzymanowski or Szymanowski. Early life Ernst Biberstein was born Ernst Szymanowski in Hilchenbach, Province of Westphalia. His early education was at Mülheim. He was a private in World War I from March 1917 to 1919. Upon discharge, he studied theology from March 1919 through 1921 and became a Protestant pastor on 28 December 1924. In 1935 he entered the and was later transferred to the Reichssicherheitshauptamt. Nazism Biberstein joined the Nazi party in 1926 and the SS on 13 September 1936 (membership number 272692). From March through October 1940 he was again a soldier. In 1941, he changed his name from Szymanowski to Biberstein. After the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, he was assigned command of Einsatzkommando 6 in June 1942. Nuremberg and later life Biberstein was a defendant at the Einsatzgruppen Trial during the Nuremberg Trials. His trial began in September 1947 and ended on 9 April 1948. At his arraignment, along with all other defendants, he pleaded not guilty on all charges. Einsatzkommando 6 was charged with having executed some two to three thousand people. It was brought to light that at Rostow, Biberstein had personally supervised the execution of some 50 to 60 people. The victims were stripped of valuable articles (and partially of clothes), gassed, and left in a mass grave. He was also present at executions where victims were made to kneel at the edge of a pit and killed with a submachine gun. Biberstein was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. His sentenced was reviewed by the \\"Peck Panel\\", and later commuted to life imprisonment in 1951. He was released in 1958 and temporarily returned to the clergy. He died in 1986 in Neumünster. In media Biberstein was portrayed in the 1978 NBC Holocaust television miniseries by Edward Hardwicke.

It's likely that this lack of focus confused the record-buying public as to what type of music this was and caused it to be overlooked.\\" Track listing Personnel * Sarah Vaughan – vocals * Jerome Richardson – flute * Wayne Andre – trombone * Dick Hixson – bass trombone * Bernard Eichen – violin * Barry Galbraith – guitar * Bob James – piano * Willie Bobo – percussion * Bobby Donaldson – drums * George Duvivier – double bass * Frank Foster – arranger, conductor * Quincy Jones – producer References Category:Sarah Vaughan albums Category:1965 albums Category:Mercury Records albums Category:Albums produced by Quincy Jones Category:Albums arranged by Frank Foster (musician) Category:Albums conducted by Frank Foster (musician) Category:Bossa nova albums ","title":"¡Viva!

(UK shown in green) Cornish nationalism is a cultural, political and social movement that seeks the recognition of Cornwall – the south-westernmost part of the island of Great Britain – as a nation distinct from England. It is usually based on three general arguments: *that Cornwall has a Celtic cultural identity separate from that of England, and that the Cornish people have a national, civic or ethnic identity separate from that of English people; *that Cornwall should be granted a degree of devolution or autonomy, usually in the form of a Cornish national assembly; *and that Cornwall is legally a territorial and constitutional Duchy with the right to veto Westminster legislation, not merely a county of England, and has never been formally incorporated into England via an Act of Union. Autonomy movement Cornish nationalists, such as Mebyon Kernow, generally seek some form of autonomy for Cornwall. In 2003, a Cornish councillor commissioned a researcher to see if self-governing practices used in Guernsey could be applied to Cornwall. Distinct cultural, national or ethnic identity St Piran's Day is an annual patronal Cornish festival celebrating Cornish culture and history every 5 March The percentage of respondents who gave \\"Cornish\\" as an answer to the National Identity question in the 2011 census. In 2001, campaigners prevailed upon the UK census to count Cornish ethnicity as a write-in option on the national census, although there was no separate Cornish tick box. In 2004 school children in Cornwall could also record their ethnicity as Cornish on the schools census. In 2004, a campaign was started to field a Cornish national team in the 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, in 2006, the Commonwealth Games Federation stated that \\"Cornwall is no more than an English county\\". The concept that the Cornish are a separate ethnicity is based on the Celtic origin and language of the Cornish, making them an ethnic minority distinct from people in the rest of England. In 2011, an e-petition directed at Westminster was launched. :\\"This petition calls for signatures to raise the issue of the \\"Cornish Identity\\" in Parliament and aims to have Cornwall recognised as a National Minority..\\"Recognition of Cornwall as a National Minority on Epetitionsd dot direct gov dot uk This petition has now closed, it received 851 signatures, (99,149 less than the 100,000 needed for the matter to be considered for debate in the House of Commons.) In September 2011, George Eustice, Conservative Member of Parliament for Camborne and Redruth, argued that Cornwall's heritage should be administered by a Cornish organisation rather than English Heritage. On 24 April 2014 the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, announced that the Cornish people had been granted minority status under the Council of Europe's framework for the protection of national minorities, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Constitutional status The official position on the Duchy of Cornwall The Duchy of Cornwall is a private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of The Prince of Wales and his family. The Duchy itself consists of around 54,424 hectares (134,485 acres) of land in 23 counties, mostly in the South West of England. The current Duke of Cornwall is Charles, Prince of Wales. The Duchy estate was created in 1337 by Edward III, King of England, for his son and heir, Prince Edward, and its primary function was to provide him and future Princes of Wales with an income from its assets. A charter ruled that each future Duke of Cornwall would be the eldest surviving son of the monarch and thus also the male heir to the throne. The current Duke of Cornwall, Prince Charles, as eldest son of the reigning monarch is also the Prince of Wales. The rights of the Duchy of Cornwall Cornish constitutionalists argue that the Duke of Cornwall is the de jure head of state in Cornwall. The rights of the Dukes of Cornwall include the right to intestate estates, bona vacantia, treasure trove, gold and silver deposits, waste land, foreshore, rivers and estuaries, mines, mineral rights, rights of common, castles, advowsons, and so on- whether in possession or reputed or claimed to be parcel of the Duchy of Cornwall- the Duchy being the body that collects the rents and dues on behalf of the Prince. (Duchy Charters: Section 5.11, [29]). Furthermore, the entirety of the Isles of Scilly is claimed despite the Duchy's admitting that they were not included in, rather \\"omitted\\" from, the three Duchy Charters. County or country? On 15 May 2000 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament (CSP), a pressure group formed in 1974, dispatched an invoice to the chief officer of the Duchy of Cornwall, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. This invoice demanded a refund of a calculated £20 billion overcharge in taxation on tin production from 1337–1837. This was calculated according to production figures and historic wealth calculation methods (from an unpublished thesis of a Harvard University undergraduate dating from 1908), and The Sunday Times Rich List, March 2000, respectively. Cornwall was charged at over twice the rate levied on the adjacent county of Devon. On 17 May 2000 The Guardian reported that the CSP claimed that the Duchy had levied an excess tax on tin production in Cornwall for five hundred years, and requested repayment within 120 days. The CSP argued that their action demonstrated how Cornwall was treated separately from England in the past, and thus should have special status today. They declared that if they received the money it would be spent on an agency to boost Cornwall's economy. The Guardian went on to point out that the Duke of Cornwall himself, Charles the Prince of Wales is in effect trustee and cannot sell off the Duchy's assets thus he would have difficulty in paying the bill. Charles does not receive any money from the state. His financial stability comes from the £5m-£6m annual net surplus generated by the Duchy. Background History of the separate Cornish identity King Canute, Cornwall fell outside his British realms.John, H. (1995) The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings. London: Penguin Books In 936 Athelstan fixed Cornwall's eastern boundary at the Tamar.Philip Payton. (1996). Cornwall. Fowey: Alexander Associates The Italian scholar Polydore Vergil in his famous Anglica Historia, published in 1535, wrote that: 'the whole Countrie of Britain ...is divided into iiii partes; whereof the one is inhabited of Englishmen, the other of Scottes, the third of Wallshemen, [and] the fowerthe of Cornishe people, which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, ...in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces.' Writing in 1616, Arthur Hopton stated:'England is ...divided into 3 great Provinces, or Countries ...every of them speaking a several and different language, as English, Welsh and Cornish.' During the Tudor period many travellers were clear that the Cornish were commonly regarded as a separate ethnic group. For example, Lodovico Falier, an Italian diplomat at the Court of Henry VIII, said, \\"The language of the English, Welsh and Cornish men is so different that they do not understand each other.\\" He went on to give the alleged 'national characteristics' of the three peoples, saying for example 'the Cornishman is poor, rough and boorish' Another notable example is Gaspard de Coligny Châtillon – the French Ambassador in London – who wrote saying that England was not a united whole as it 'contains Wales and Cornwall, natural enemies of the rest of England, and speaking a different language.' In 1603, the Venetian ambassador wrote that the late queen had ruled over five different 'peoples': 'English, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish ...and Irish'. It seems however that the recognition by outsiders of the Cornish as a separate people declined with the language, which by the 19th century had essentially ceased to be used. The modern revival of the language, which had almost died out has caused some interest in the concept of Cornish identity. History of modern Cornish nationalism Cornwall has had its own gorsedd, Gorseth Kernow, since 1928 The history of modern Cornish nationalism goes back to the end of the 19th century. The failure of Irish home rule caused Gladstone's Liberal party to revise and make more relevant its devolution policy by advocating the idea of 'home rule all round' applying to Scotland and Wales but opening the door for Cornish Liberals to use cultural themes for political purposes. In April 1889, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquis of Salisbury (who served three times as Prime Minister) at a meeting of the Primrose League in Bristol, spoke on the state of the Union. At the time, an Irish Cabinet \\"with all the appurtenances of government\\" was being considered. He said that \\"if Ireland were granted a Parliament and a Cabinet, Scotland would demand a Parliament and a Cabinet, and Wales would do the same.\\" However, \\"..if all these Parliaments were granted an unconstitutional injustice would be done to Cornwall, which was a separate country geographically..\\" going on to talk about Cornish identity and culture, \\"On these grounds, which were set up as good reasons for granting separate and independent Governments to other parts of the empire, the claims of Cornwall could not be overlooked to a separate and independent Government, and if it was to come about, he hoped that all the alliances of the commission Parliaments and Cabinets would be friendly to the British Government.\\" Henry Jenner was an important figure in early 20th-century Cornish national awareness. He made the case for Cornwall's membership in the Celtic Congress, pioneered the movement to revive the Cornish language, and founded the Cornish Gorseth. Some intellectual support for Cornish self-government has come from the Institute of Cornish Studies, affiliated to the University of Exeter. In 2000, the Cornish Constitutional Convention launched a campaign for a Cornish Assembly. This was a cross-party movement representing many political voices and positions in Cornwall, from Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Solidarity to the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It collected over 50,000 petition signatures. A similar petition was started online by Mebyon Kernow in 2014, along with a series of \\"Assembly Roadshows\\" . This only achieved 2655 signatures, (a significant minority of which were not from Cornwall,) leaving it far short of the 5000 needed. On 14 July 2009, Dan Rogerson MP, of the Liberal Democrats, presented a Cornish 'breakaway' bill to the Parliament in Westminster – 'The Government of Cornwall Bill'. The bill proposes a devolved Assembly for Cornwall, similar to the Welsh and Scottish set up. The bill states that Cornwall should re-assert its rightful place within the United Kingdom. Rogerson argued that, \\"Cornwall should re-assert its rightful place within the United Kingdom. Cornwall is a unique part of the country, and this should be reflected in the way that it is governed. We should have the right to determine areas of policy that affect the people of Cornwall the hardest, such as rules on housing ... Cornwall has the right to a level of self- Government. If the Government is going to recognise the right of Scotland and Wales to greater self-determination because of their unique cultural and political positions, then they should recognise ours.\\"Government of Cornwall Bill – Cornish Assembly – Dan Rogerson MP – July 2009 The Cornish independence movement received unexpected publicity in 2004, when Channel 4's Alternative Christmas message, featuring the Simpsons, showed Lisa Simpson chanting Free Cornwall Now! / Rydhsys rag Kernow lemmyn ! (\\"Freedom for Cornwall now!\\") and holding a placard saying \\"UK OUT OF CORNWALL\\".  Support  Cornish flag, the banner of Cornwall's patron saint Saint Piran, has become a symbol of Cornwall and is flown throughout the county. Cornwall County Council's Feb 2003 MORI poll showed 55% in favour of a referendum on an elected, fully devolved regional assembly for Cornwall and 13% against. (Previous result: 46% in favour in 2002) However the same MORI poll indicated an equal number of Cornish respondents were in favour of a South West Regional Assembly, (70% in favour of a Cornish assembly, 72% in favour of a S.West Regional assembly) .The campaign for a Cornish Assembly had the support of all three Cornish Lib Dem MPs, Mebyon Kernow, and Cornwall Council. However, in 2015, the Conservative party won all six seats in Cornwall, removing the Lib Dems supporters from office, (all six Conservative MPs were returned to office in the 2017 and 2019 elections). Lord Whitty, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in the House of Lords, recognised that Cornwall has a \\"special case\\" for devolution.House of Lords debates, Wednesday, 21 March 2001, \\"Devolution: England\\" transcript of speech and on a visit to Cornwall the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said \\"Cornwall has the strongest regional identity in the UK.\\" In October 2007 the then Lib Dem MP Andrew George stated in a press release, \\"Just because the Government has approached the whole Regional Devolution agenda in entirely the wrong way, does not mean to say that the project itself should be ditched. If Scotland is benefiting from devolution then Cornwall should learn from this and increase the intensity of its own campaign for devolution to a Cornish Assembly.\\" Andrew George lost his seat in the 2015 election. On Tuesday 17 July 2007, Local Government Minister John Healey MP announced Government plans to abolish regional assemblies. Functions of regional assemblies are planned to pass to Regional Development Agencies in 2010. The South West Regional Assembly was replaced by the South West Regional Development Agency in 2010. The South West Regional Development Agency was closed in 2012. On 19 July 2007, MP Dan Rogerson welcomed the government announcement that unelected Regional Assemblies are to be scrapped and he asked the government to look again at the case for a locally accountable Cornish Assembly and Cornish Development agency, \\"in light of the important convergence funding from the EU\\". Cornish MP Andrew George said in July 2007 I'm optimistic that the Minister's announcement will give us the future prospects to build a strong consensus, demonstrate Cornwall's distinctiveness from the Government zone for the South West and then draw up plans so that we can decide matters for ourselves locally rather than being told by unelected quangos in Bristol and elsewhere.\\" Dan Rogerson lost his seat in the 2015 election. In December 2007, Cornwall Council Leader David Whalley stated \\"There is something inevitable about the journey to a Cornish Assembly. We are also moving forward in creating a Cornish Development Agency – we are confident that strategic planning powers will come back to us after the SW regional assembly goes.\\" David Whally quit his post in 2009 In 2008 Cornish Liberal Democrat councillors agreed plans to create a Unitary authority for the region, abolishing the six district councils. This meant that where previously there was once one elected member for every 3,000 residents, there is now one councillor for every 7,000 people. The unitary authority \\"One Cornwall\\" Council does however not have the same powers as the proposed Cornish Assembly. Westminster ruled out any extra powers for Cornwall and the South West Regional Development Agency remained in place until 2009. This means that Cornish Objective One money was managed from outside of Cornwall. There have in fact been suggestions that powers could be taken from the new Cornish unitary authority as it may struggle to cope with the extra workload inherited from the district councils. A premise for a single governing body for Cornwall was that the new Cornwall Council would have greater powers, being granted more responsibilities from Westminster. The Communist Party of Britain has voiced support saying \\"[We] support....Cornish culture and the Cornish language and for the aspiration of Cornish people to have the special status and needs of Cornwall to be acknowledged. \\" Political parties and pressure groups *Mebyon Kernow is the key political party advocating greater Cornish home rule. Since 2004 Mebyon Kernow has been a member of the Europe- wide political group, the European Free Alliance (alongside the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru – Party of Wales), which has five Members of the European Parliament (two from the SNP, one from Plaid Cymru, one from the Republican Left of Catalonia and one Latvian MEP), and is part of the Greens/EFA group. Mebyon Kernow contested its first European Parliamentary elections in 2009, where they entered candidates for the UK southwest region which comprises Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gibraltar, Gloucestershire and Bristol, as well as Cornwall, although they failed to win any seats. Mebyon Kernow has held a consistent 4% of the vote total in Cornwall Council elections, and currently has 4 councillors out of the total of 123 elected. At national level in general elections, Mebyon Kernow has achieved between 1.3% and 1.9% of the Cornish vote. *Cornish Constitutional Convention is a cross- party advisory group that has been instrumental in moulding opinion in both Cornwall and London towards a new accommodation for Cornwall within the United Kingdom. It was formed in November 2000 with the objective of establishing a devolved Assembly for Cornwall (Senedh Kernow).Cornish assembly It states that \\"The aim of the Convention is to establish a form of modern governance which strengthens Cornwall, her role in the affairs of the country, and positively addresses the problems that have arisen from more than a century of growing isolation and loss of confidence.\\" Its principal lobbying document is DEVOLUTION for ONE and ALL: Governance for Cornwall in the 21st Century The convention has not published any new work since 2009. Celtic League and Celtic Congress consider Cornwall to be one of six Celtic nations. *The Celtic League and Celtic Congress have a Cornish branch and recognise Cornwall as a Celtic Nation alongside the Isle of Man, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany. The league is a political pressure group that campaigns for independence and Celtic cooperation. *The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament was a pressure group on Cornish constitutional and cultural issues. The websites of the CSP provides an overview of their main points and current campaigns. The CSP has one of its members in the Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN) . The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament has not been active since 2008. *The Cornish Nationalist Party was formed in 1975 by Dr James Whetter and is currently not registered to contest elections. *Cornish Solidarity were a non-partisan political pressure group that called for the recognition of the ethnic Cornish as a national minority. They are currently in \\"hibernation\\" *John Angarrack of Cornwall 2000, the Human Rights organisation, has written and by self-publishing has produced three books to date, \\"Breaking the Chains\\", \\"Our Future is History\\" and \\"Scat t’Larrups?\\" released on 15 May 2008. They detail many of the core issues of the Cornish national movement as well as a re-examination of Cornish history and the Cornish constitution. The \\"Cornish Fighting Fund\\" was launched by Cornwall 2000 in August 2008. However the fund failed to meet the required target of £100,000 by the end of December 2008, having received just over £33,000 in pledges, and the plan is now abandoned. The instigator of the campaign, John Angarrack, on launching the fund stated; \\"If by that date (8 Dec 2008), the strategy outlined here has not gathered the required level of support, we shall assume that the Cornish community does not cherish its identity nor care that it survives.\\" *Tyr Gwyr Gweryn (Cornish for land, truth, people) was originally a focus group formed out of members of 'Cowethas Flamank', a Cornish affairs group, and participants in Kescusulyans Kernow (Conference of Cornwall) having a special interest in the constitution of Cornwall. TGG has posted to its website, the transcript of the dispute between the Crown & Duchy of Cornwall (1855–1857) over ownership the Cornish Foreshore. This has been done in order to place the previously hidden legal argument and evidence, submitted for arbitration, into the public domain. * An Gof was a militant organisation, which was active in the early 1980s. A message was sent in 2007 claiming that it had reformed and was responsible for graffiti in various places around Cornwall and attacks on St. George's flags. Later in 2007, it claimed to have merged with another group to form the Cornish National Liberation Army. A message was sent claiming to be from this organisation, threatening celebrity chefs Rick Stein and Jamie Oliver, blaming them for the increase in house prices caused by the trend towards English people owning second homes in Cornwall. It is far from clear whether this was ever a real organisation. Political representation In Cornwall In the 2009 local elections Mebyon Kernow won three of the 123 seats on the then newly created Cornwall Council. An independent councillor joined Mebyon Kernow in 2010. Mebyon Kernow also has 18 parish councillors elected. A number of nationalist independents were also elected to the Cornwall Council. Prior to the 2013 local elections Mebyon Kernow held six seats on the council, having gained two due to defections from other parties, and winning one in a by-election. Keeping the seat won in the by-election, and a gain of one seat elsewhere, left them with four in total. This dropped them to being the sixth largest group on the council, from the position of fourth largest prior to the election, being overtaken by UKIP and the Labour party. In the 2017 council elections Mebyon Kernow again won 4 of the 123 seats available. In the United Kingdom Mebyon Kernow does not have any members elected to the UK parliament, but Andrew George and Dan Rogerson of the Liberal Democrats took up nationalist causes both in Parliament and outside of it. Andrew George was the first MP to take his parliamentary oath in Cornish. All five Cornish Liberal Democrat MPs put their names to the Government of Cornwall Bill 2009 which proposed setting up a legislative Cornish Assembly. In the 2015, 2017 and 2019 elections all six Cornish seats returned Conservative MPs, ousting the aforementioned Lib Dem supporters. In Europe Mebyon Kernow is a member of the European Free Alliance party in the European Parliament. In the 2009 European elections it received 14,922 votes, insufficient to gain any MEPs. Mebyon Kernow did not stand in the 2014 European elections. Violence A group called An Gof, referring to the blacksmith Michael An Gof who led the failed rebellion of 1497, made a number of attacks in the 1980s, including a bomb at a courthouse in St Austell in 1980, a fire in a Penzance hairdressers a year later, and an arson attack on a bingo hall in Redruth. It remained silent until 2007, when it made a statement that \\"any attempts from hereon to fly the hated and oppressive Flag of St George, which we know as the blood banner in our country, will result in direct action by our organisation\\". An English flag in Tresillian earlier that year was destroyed and the words \\"English Out\\" daubed on a garden wall. In 2007, an email was sent from someone claiming to represent the Cornish National Liberation Army. It made headlines when it threatened to burn down two restaurants in Padstow and Newquay belonging to Rick Stein and Jamie Oliver respectively, whom the group called \\"English newcomers\\". The group claimed it had funding from \\"other Celtic Nations\\" and the United States, and appeared to be an amalgamation of the Cornish Liberation Army and An Gof. It also reportedly sprayed \\"burn second homes\\" onto walls in the county. There were also reports that the group had placed broken glass under the sand on Cornish beaches, \\"to deter tourists. \\"The group's actions were linked to local concerns about lack of affordable housing and an increasing number of second homes.

Hamilton also became the first solo artist in the label's history to have a US top-ten pop hit when \\"Unchained Melody\\" peaked at No. 6 in May 1955. Early life Roy Hamilton was born in Leesburg, Georgia where he began singing in church choirs at the age of six. In the summer of 1943, when Hamilton was fourteen, the family migrated north to Jersey City, New Jersey in search of a better life. There, he sang with the Central Baptist Church Choir, New Jersey's most famous African American church choir. At Lincoln High School, he studied commercial art and was gifted enough to place his paintings with a number of New York City galleries.Cotten, Lee (1989). \\"Shake, Rattle & Roll: The Golden Age of American Rock 'n Roll Vol. 1 1952 – 1955” (1st ed.). Michigan: Pierian Press. p. 163. In February 1947, seventeen-year-old Hamilton took his first big step into secular music, winning a talent contest at the legendary Apollo Theater. But nothing came of it. \\"I couldn't get a break,\\" Hamilton recalled. \\"I really had nothing different to offer. They were seeking blues singers at the time, and I didn't know any blues at all.\\" So, to support himself while he developed the different sound and singing style he wanted,Hentoff, Nat (February 9, 1955). Hamilton Booms From $5-A-Night Obscurity. \\"Down Beat\\", p. 2 Hamilton worked as an electronics technician during the day, and an amateur heavyweight boxer at night, with a record of six wins and one defeat. In 1948, Hamilton joined the Searchlight Gospel Singers and also studied light opera, working with New Jersey voice coach J. Martin Rolls for more than a year. Hamilton continued to perform gospel with the Searchlight Singers, in churches and at gospel concerts, until 1953 when the group broke up and each member went off in his own direction. Hamilton headed back into pop music. But this time, he felt he finally had something different to offer. Music career Epic beginning and career rise (1953–56) In mid-1953, Hamilton was discovered singing in a Newark, New Jersey night club, The Caravan, by Bill Cook, who became his manager. Cook was the first African American radio disc jockey and television personality on the East Coast.Grendysa, Peter (April 1979). Roy Hamilton Never Walking Alone. \\"Goldmine\\", p.9 Cook made a demo tape of Hamilton's singing and brought it to the attention of Columbia Records. Columbia was impressed enough to sign Hamilton to their rhythm and blues subsidiary, Okeh Records. On November 11, 1953, Hamilton made his first recordings for the label in New York City. The session produced Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" from the musical Carousel.Grendysa, Peter (April 1979). Roy Hamilton Never Walking Alone. \\"Goldmine\\", p.13 The tune, one of the few secular numbers that Hamilton knew at the time, had been his live-performance specialty since 1947. But before it was released, Columbia had second thoughts and placed Hamilton with their newly-launched \\"pop\\" subsidiary label Epic. In the early 1950s, there were only two black male singers who were widely accepted by white audiences as mainstream pop stars: Nat King Cole and Billy Eckstine.Friedwald, Will (2010). \\"A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers\\" (1st ed.). New York: Pantheon Books. p. 203. Epic saw that same kind of \\"crossover\\" star potential in Hamilton, placing a nearly full-page ad in the January 23, 1954 edition of Billboard magazine which read, \\"a great new voice makes news with a great song! Roy Hamilton, You’ll Never Walk Alone…\\"Music. (January 23, 1954). The Billboard, p.16. In spite of poor musical backing, Hamilton's performance on \\"Walk Alone\\" is sensationalMusic. (January 30, 1954). The Billboard, p.32. and is the primary reason why it topped the Billboard R&B; chart for eight weeks and became a national US Top-30 hit. His follow-up single, \\"If I Loved You\\", was another Rodgers and Hammerstein tune from Carousel. Although not as big a hit for Hamilton as \\"Walk Alone\\", it still reached number four on the US R&B; chart. On the evening of July 24, 1954, Hamilton appeared on the bill of \\"Star Night\\", a concert package at Chicago's Soldier Field starring Perry Como, Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan.Talent Review. (August 7, 1954). The Billboard, p.45. Since he was the newcomer on the bill, Hamilton was given the least amount of time to perform: six minutes, to perform two songs. Hamilton's plan was to perform \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\", the only song he was known for at the time, and its bouncy b-side. But Perry Como squashed that plan when he announced during afternoon rehearsal that \\"Walk Alone\\" was going to be his closing number that night. Hamilton, forced into performing a \\"Walk Alone\\" replacement on the spot, decided on \\"Ebb Tide\\", a song that had been a hit for Vic Damone a few months earlier—a song that Hamilton himself hadn't yet recorded. That evening, for his second and final number, Hamilton unveiled his gospel-tinged version of \\"Ebb Tide\\" before a Soldier Field audience of 82,000. By the time he had finished singing and exited the stage, all 82,000 people were on their feet, applauding, stomping and chanting for more. Changing in his dressing room, Hamilton had to be summoned back out on stage to quiet the crowd. He returned to the stage to witness that even some of his fellow performers—Nat Cole, Sarah Vaughan and orchestra leader Ray Anthony—had joined in the ovation.Morrison, Allan (June 1955). Roy Hamilton. Ebony, p. 34 On July 28, four days after his \\"Star Night\\" triumph, Epic Records had Hamilton record, \\"Ebb Tide\\". It became his third straight hit. On Saturday night, September 11, 1954, Hamilton made his national television debut on CBS's Stage Show, hosted by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey.Robinson, Major (September 16, 1954). Singer Roy Hamilton To Make TV Debut On CBS. \\"Jet\\", p.66 But the national television appearance that put Hamilton's career on the fast track to crossover success was the one he made on the night of March 6, 1955 when he sang \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" on CBS's top-rated Ed Sullivan Show. In reviewing his performance, Variety magazine summed up Hamilton's new way of singing the Great American Songbook by writing: \\"Hamilton made good with his single, 'You'll Never Walk Alone', which he endowed with the values of a spiritual.\\"Jose (March 9, 1955). TV Reviews. “Variety”, p.32 Ten days after the Sullivan Show appearance, Epic, in a rushed attempt to cover singer Al Hibbler's version of \\"Unchained Melody\\", set up a recording session for Hamilton. The resulting single was shipped within five days.Cotten, Lee (1989). Shake, Rattle & Roll: The Golden Age of American Rock 'n Roll Vol. 1 1952 – 1955 (1st ed.). Michigan: Pierian Press. p. 231. Two months later, in the May 18, 1955 issue of Down Beat magazine, Hamilton was named \\"Vocalist of the Year\\". Meanwhile, in Billboard magazine's May 21, 1955 issue, Hamilton's gospel-tinged \\"Unchained Melody\\" had taken over the top spot on the R&B; chart while, on the pop chart, it had reached the number six spot. It was the second number-one R&B; hit of his career as well as the first, and only, top-ten US pop hit of his career. On the heels of his \\"Unchained Melody\\" success, Hamilton recorded the following Great American Songbook singles in succession: Vincent Youmans' \\"Without a Song\\" (#77 US pop), Jimmy McHugh's \\"Cuban Love Song\\", Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"Everybody's Got a Home But Me\\" (#42 US pop), from the musical Pipe Dream, and Frank Loesser's \\"Somebody Somewhere\\", from the musical The Most Happy Fella. Retirement and comeback (1956–62) In mid-1956, Hamilton, developing what was described as a \\"lung condition\\" bordering on tuberculosis, announced his retirement from show business. When he resumed his career a year later, Hamilton could no longer generate hit singles performing pop standards because, overnight, rock and roll had become the record industry's predominant commercial force. So, in late 1957, Epic coaxed Hamilton into recording \\"Don't Let Go\\", an R&B; rocker produced by Otis Blackwell, the man who had written the two biggest number-one hits of Elvis Presley's career: \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" and \\"All Shook Up\\". By early 1958, \\"Don't Let Go\\" had become the second US top-15 pop hit of Hamilton's career and the first top-40 hit ever recorded in stereo. In 1959, Hamilton appeared, in a cameo role, in the Filipino motion picture produced by People's Pictures \\"Hawaiian Boy\\" where he sings \\"Unchained Melody\\". Hamilton's last hit record, \\"You Can Have Her\\" (#6 R&B;, No. 12 pop), came in 1961, and was followed by the album Mr. Rock And Soul (1962). The Epic label treated Hamilton as a major star and issued sixteen albums by him. Later years (1963–69) By the mid-1960s, Hamilton's career declined while recording with MGM and then RCA. In January 1969, in Memphis, Tennessee, Hamilton made the final recordings of his career. The tracks were laid down at record producer Chips Moman's American Sound Studio, at the same time Elvis Presley was recording there. Songs released from those Hamilton sessions were cover versions of James Carr's \\"The Dark End of the Street\\", Conway Twitty's \\"It's Only Make Believe\\", and \\"Angelica\\", a Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil song that had been submitted to Presley, but which he then turned over to Hamilton. Death In early July 1969, Hamilton suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage at his home in New Rochelle, New York.Barbee, Bobbie (August 7, 1969). Singer Roy Hamilton To Make TV Debut On CBS. \\"Jet\\", p.57 He was taken to New Rochelle General Hospital where he lay in a coma for more than a week. On July 20, 1969, he was removed from life support and died. Hamilton was 40 years old. At the time of his death, Hamilton was heavily in debt, forcing him, a week before he died, to borrow heavily on his insurance policy to pay off back taxes. This prompted his widow, Myrna, to publicly seek funds for his burial. At Hamilton's funeral services, messages of condolence sent by Elvis Presley, gospel legend Mahalia Jackson and blues legend B.B. King were read.1,200 Attend Roy Hamilton Rites; Famed Singer Died Broke, in Debt. (August 2, 1969). Philadelphia Tribune, p.20.Roy Hamilton Rites Lack Big Name Stars. (August 9, 1969). The New Courier, p. 2. Legacy Hamilton was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2010. Hamilton was Epic Records' first star, giving the company its first number-one hit of any kind, \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\", which topped the Billboard R&B; chart for eight weeks in 1954. A year later, he gave the label its second number-one hit of any kind when his version of \\"Unchained Melody\\" topped the Billboard R&B; chart for three weeks. Also, with \\"Unchained Melody\\", Hamilton became the first solo artist to deliver a top-ten pop hit for Epic. Hamilton was the singer who inspired Sam Cooke, then a gospel music star, to switch over to secular music. Hamilton was also the one to whom Cooke first submitted his early pop-song compositions.Guralnick, Peter (2005): Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke (1st ed.). New York: Little, Brown and Company, p. 332. Hamilton's distinctive sound was a big influence on Elvis Presley's ballad singing.Simpson, Paul (2002): The Rough Guide to Elvis (1st ed.). London: Penguin Books, p. 197. As author Fred L. Worth noted, \\"Elvis greatly admired Hamilton's singing ability and style and performed a number of his ballads in Hamilton's style.\\"Worth, Fred L. (1988). Elvis: His Life From A to Z (1st ed.). Chicago: Contemporary Books. Also, The Righteous Brothers emulated Hamilton's style to create their blue-eyed soul sound. This is particularly evident in the duo's cover versions of his hits \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\", \\"Ebb Tide\\" and \\"Unchained Melody\\". Hamilton's \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" disc was brought in from the US by a sailor friend of Gerry and the Pacemakers leader Gerry Marsden. As a result, the band recorded a UK version of the song which became the anthem for Liverpool Football Club, sung by the crowd before every home game. The sailor friend noted that Marsden \\"puts very similar inflections into the song, trying to get it very similar to Roy Hamilton's version.\\" Discography Singles {class= - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Titles (A-side, B-side) Both sides from same album except where indicated ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Label & number ! colspan=\\"2\\"Chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Album - !

In 1993, Canada's centre of population fell in the area, despite the lack of any population centers with over 1000 residents. The more current and geographically separate Longford Township is a unique situation in that the township is wholly owned by Longford Reserve Limited, and contains no permanent inhabitants. New Longford Township within Kawartha Lakes The former Township of Longford, was surveyed in 1861 by Brookes Wright Gossage, as one of ten townships sold to the Canadian Land and Emigration Company. Longford was the only one of the townships within Victoria County. In 1867 John Thomson purchased by auction the right to cut timber in the township, from the Canadian Land and Emigration Company, to supply timber for his mill at Longford Mills, named for the township. Thomson later purchased the township outright from the Company. The old Digby fire tower was situated on rocky outcropping straight north of the village of Uphill, where the old fire trail used to exist, along the former alignment of the Victoria Rd. The tower was de-commissioned in the late 1960s. The area now is mostly swamp, but can be accessed on a newer private road to the west. The township is also home to a few ghost settlements from the bygone logging/ farming era of the 19th century. These include: Ragged Rapids and the eastern part of Uphill.

Founded in 1963 in Linköping, Sweden, Biltema also has stores in Finland, Norway and Denmark. The company is owned privately by founder Sten Åke Lindholm, through Dutch company Biltema BV. History In 1963 the company started with auto parts store under the name \\"Handelsbolaget BIL-TEMA\\". The business was mail order sales of automotive parts and accessories. In the first catalog the reader was asked: \\"Why pay more?\\", which became Biltema's slogan. Biltema was based in a small basement in Linköping. After a year the firm expanded mail-order business with a small shop, also in the same basement. The policy of buying directly from the manufacturer led to Biltema soon began to look up where the manufacture of the various products were made. Back in the late 1970s, the company began building strategic sourcing contacts around the world. Lindholm's strong technical interest frequently led to several of the major manufacturers listened to Biltema's requirements and together developed the quality products beyond what was standard. Several of these improvements has also come out to the market as a very well known brands. In 1976, sales have risen to about 25 million and the company moved to new premises of the Torvinge area in Linköping. Local surface was 6,000 square meters big and contained both mail order, central warehouse and a shop of almost 250 square meters.

History Bexley's history can be traced back to Indian villages established at the end of the Portage Road, a long historic trail that ended at the site of St. Mary's, on the western shore of Balsam Lake's West Bay. The villages flourished and faded for at least a century prior to the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on his tour with the Hurons. Various tribes used the site up until 1760, when English fur traders established a trading post at the site. Victoria County was opened to settlement in 1821, but Bexley remained unchanged for over a decade due to its northern position within the county, which meant it was surveyed at some point in the early 1830s. The first settler was Admiral Vansittart, who was given a grant of one thousand acres (4 km2) of land on the west shores of Balsam Lake in 1834. His cousin, Nicholas Vansittart, Chancellor of the Exchequer - known commonly as Lord or Baron Bexley - was a colleague of John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, after whom Eldon Township is named. Bexley's principal population centre - Coboconk - was founded in 1851 and continues to thrive off summer tourism from recreational cottagers. Geography According to the 1996 Canadian census, the last prior to the amalgamation of Victoria County, the township has a total area of . Like most of the city of Kawartha Lakes, Bexley is mostly rural. A few established communities dot the landscape, and the shores of Balsam and Silver Lakes are surrounded by seasonal cottages, while the remainder is mostly swamp, or forest. Farming is sparse in the region as the soil is very thin (About 2 inches on average). While Bexley lies almost entirely within the Paleozoic limestone region of southern Ontario, the small portion of the Gull River valley north of Silver Lake lying within the township is within the Precambrian Canadian Shield region. Demographics *Note that the following precise figures were rounded to the nearest 5 by Statistics Canada, and that percentages may have a small statistical error. As of the census of 1996, there were 1305 people, 540 households and 390 families residing in the township. The population density was 10.61 people per square kilometre (/mi2). The racial makeup of the county was 1.9% Chinese, 0.8% Black Canadian, and the remaining 97.3% Caucasian. There were 540 households and 390 families, out of which 92.31% were married or common-law couples, and 7.69% were single parent families. 27.78% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household value was $143,198. The population was spread out, with 5.0% under the age of 4, 11.1% from 5 to 14, 8.8% from 15 to 24, 36.4% from 25 to 54, 15.7% from 55 to 64, and 22.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.5 years. For every 100 females there were 101.5 males. The median per capita income for the township was $21,002. Males had a median income of $23,682 versus $18,009 for females. In the population over 25, 14.7% had less than a grade nine education. 57.1% had at least a high school diploma or equivalent. 29.8% graduated from a non-university post-secondary institute, and 7.9% completed university.

He was very influential on West German sociology after 1949. Born in Magdeburg, he 1925 took up Philosophy, Psychology, Ethnology, and Islamic Studies at the Universities of Vienna and Berlin. He gained his doctorate (Dr. phil.) 1930 at the Berlin University. As an enemy of the Nazis, he could not obtain his post- doctoral degree (Habilitation) in the Reich, so he emigrated to Switzerland in 1937 and passed the examination at the University of Zürich, 1938. By then, he was strongly influenced by Émile Durkheim, Maurice Halbwachs, and Marcel Mauss. 1949, he was called to the chair of Sociology at Cologne University, where he built up what was to be known later as the \\"Cologne School\\" (Kölner Schule) and established the Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. He never left this university, in spite of several calls, and became Professor Emeritus in 1974, dying at Cologne 1992. He never gave up cultural studies writing the first sociology of fashion, but at the same time he was a German pioneer of empirical methods, as against the ideological biases of many contemporal colleagues. He played as well an important role in the International Sociological Association. He was the fifth president of ISA (1962-1966). Besides, he was en engaged liberal writer and essayist, and translated the novelist Giovanni Verga from the Italian into German.

Participants try to identify the greatest number of bird species throughout the state of New Jersey, United States, over a 24-hour period on a Saturday in mid-May. The event is also run as a fundraiser for bird conservation, with participants soliciting pledges for each species they identify. The event is organized by the New Jersey Audubon Society.  Forms of competition  There are a number of ways for birders to compete in the World Series of Birding. Teams can either search for birds throughout the state of New Jersey, limit themselves to a particular county, or tally species entirely within one single location. Different awards exist for the teams that find the highest number of species throughout New Jersey (the Urner-Stone Cup), a Limited Geographic Area (the LGA Award), or a single location of no more than a few square yards (the Big Day Big Stay Award). Separate awards also exist for the teams that find the highest species solely within Cape May County and Cape Island (the southern tip of Cape May, south of the Cape May Canal). Finally, different awards exist for the most successful youth teams (with three different age divisions) as well as the most successful all-senior team. Regardless of what age or geographic classification teams fall under, teams must consist of at least three birders. All members of a team must normally see or hear a species for it to count (though not necessarily the same individual bird), although for each 20 species seen or heard by all team members, a team may count a species seen or heard by at least two, but not all, team members. The competition is run entirely on the honor system--but as there is no prize money to be won, cheating is not considered to be an issue.  History  The idea for the World Series of Birding came from Pete Dunne, one of America's foremost authors on birding and natural history, and currently the director of the Cape May Bird Observatory. The first World Series of Birding was held on May 19, 1984, and the winning team included Dunne, David Sibley (author of the renowned The Sibley Guide to Birds), the late Pete Bacinski (former director of NJ Audubon's Owl Haven Nature Center and Sandy Hook Bird Observatory), Bill Boyle (author of A Guide to Bird Finding in New Jersey), and the legendary Roger Tory Peterson (inventor of the modern field guide) and was sponsored by Bird Watcher's Digest. Their total included 201 species, including a fork-tailed flycatcher--a tropical species rarely seen anywhere in the United States, let alone New Jersey. Since the first competition, the World Series has been held annually on a date between May 9 and May 19, which coincides with the height of the spring bird migration through New Jersey. Winning tallies have ranged from a low of 182 species in 1985 to a high of 231 species in 2003 for the team sponsored by Nikon Sport Optics and the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC). The event has steadily gained in popularity over the years; in 1984, 13 teams took part, compared with over 60 in 2006. Over the years, the World Series of Birding has raised more than $9,000,000 for bird conservation. In 2007, filmmaker Jason Kessler released his documentary, \\"Opposable Chums: Guts & Glory at The World Series of Birding,\\" which covered both the history and logistics of the event.  Strategies  Most teams that compete throughout the entire state start at midnight in the northern part of the state. During pre-daylight hours, teams often visit sites such as the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge that are home to certain kinds of owls, rails, and bitterns that are difficult to hear or see during the day. At daybreak, many teams find themselves in the far northern reaches of New Jersey attempting to find species such as purple finch and common raven that are difficult to find farther south. From 5-10 am, teams often pick up the majority of the species they will see all day. Afterwards, teams typically make their way into the central and southern parts of the state to places such as the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge at Brigantine, Cape May, and Belleplain State Forest. After dusk, teams continue to search for the nocturnal species they may have missed at the start of the day, but must be at the \\"finish line\\" at Cape May Point State Park by midnight, or face stiff penalties. Crucial to the success of any serious World Series effort is scouting for species in the days and weeks prior to the event. Most teams will have staked out desirable species (often nesting birds that can be reliably found on the day of competition) in advance to minimize the time they have to spend looking for any one species in particular. Additionally, teams should maximize the number of different habitats they visit (e.g., saltwater marshes, Canadian Zone woodlands, pine forests, beach, etc.), as different species frequent different habitats. Finally, teams should plan their route to maximize time spent birding and minimize time spent driving. For more information on route planning and strategy, see Pete Dunne's \\"Blueprint for a Big Day,\\" the World Series of Birding Discussion Forum, and the scouting notes of the Nikon/DVOC team that has won the World Series five out of the last eight years.

The Trinidad and Tobago Airline Pilots Association (TTALPA) is the registered, Recognised Majority Union and bargaining unit for Pilots in Trinidad and Tobago. TTALPA was officially registered in 1972 under the Trade Unions Ordinance and pursuant to the provision of Section 86(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1972. TTALPA is a membership organisation and as such, is funded by the dues paid by its members. Persons who hold a Trinidad & Tobago Pilots Licence are eligible for membership in TTALPA and this includes helicopter pilots. TTALPA has 4 committees and 1 advisory committee which focus on the wide spectrum of technical and professional issues that face pilots as a profession. 1\\\\. Air Safety & Training Committee The Airline Safety and Training Committee’s (AS&T;) core mandate is to improve air safety, ensure that all safety complaints and investigations result in the improvement of safety levels, improve the working environment of the individual pilot considering environmental aspects and contribute to the development of prevention policies. AS&T; monitors the application of any safety recommendations put forth by the airline, identifies and communicates unsafe events and promotes the development of safety programmes. It is currently chaired by First Officer Aleena Ali. Negotiations Committee The Negotiations Committee was formed to spearhead negotiations for the Collective Agreement between Caribbean Airlines Limited (CAL) and TTALPA’s members. Both parties to this agreement recognise their common interest in the promotion of the business of CAL and declare jointly and separately that they will use their best efforts to protect and further the well-being of the company. TTALPA agrees that it will cooperate with CAL, support its efforts to ensure full productivity and will lend support in its efforts to eliminate waste and to improve efficiency and maintain its levels of safety. Both parties recognise also the need to ensure that adequate productivity is maintained by the pilots. Hotel Committee Members of this committee work together with Caribbean Airlines Limited (CAL) to review hotel selection and ensure that they meet with the necessary safety requirements. The committee also supervises the sections of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with regard to restful lodging, ancillary services, crew lounges and transportation of pilots, to which they, CAL, must comply. Chaired by Larry Imamshah Prefbid Committee The Preferential Bidding (PrefBid) Committee is tasked with reviewing schedules put out by the airline to ensure that their contractual compliance is met. This committee meets as necessary to investigate and discuss any grievances that may arise pertaining to scheduling and to arrive at potential areas of agreement in the flight bidding process and help improve efficiency in pilot schedules. The PrefBid Committee acts in an advisory role to TTALPA member pilots regarding scheduling issues and is also charged with the implementation and fair practices of a preferential bidding system Professional Standards Committee The Professional Standards Committee promotes and maintains the highest degree of professional conduct among TALPA pilots. The main goal of this Committee is to enhance the margin of safety in daily flight operations, which is the primary concern and responsibility. It will also protect and enhance the standing of the profession including address problems of a professional or ethical nature involving pilots; resolve cases of pilot misconduct that affect flight deck safety and/or professionalism; resolve conflicts between pilots that may affect flight deck professionalism, etc. See also * List of trade unions Category:Transport trade unions in Trinidad and Tobago Category:International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations Category:Airline pilots' trade unions Category:Aviation organisations based in Trinidad and Tobago ","title":"Trinidad and Tobago Airline Pilots Association"},{"id":"10981040","text":"William Westwood, 1st Baron Westwood OBE (28 August 1880 – 13 September 1953), was a British trade unionist and Labour politician.

Story Shiroi Senshi Yamato is about a white Akita pup who strives to become the champion fighting dog of Yamagata. Over the course of the series, the main villain - Toshio - hires multiple people to attempt to kill Yamato and stop him being champion, which results in many adventures besides the fights themselves. Characters Protagonist dogs ;Yamato - ヤマト: (Akita Inu) The main character of this manga. After saving Ryō's group from some bullies as a puppy, Ryō in turn saved him from being shot down with his father's pack and took him home. He showed incredible tenacity and fighting skill in protecting them from the bullies' dog Gil, Ryō decides to make him a fighting dog. His name was taken from a battle ship called the \\"Yamato.\\" Yamato always tries to do what's right, though it is often seen backfiring (i.e. he often thinks he's on the right side when he's not, and he is often shown being unable to save what he's protecting) and is affectionate and loyal to his friends. His strongest bonds are with the puppy Musashi, and his owner. ;Fubuki - 吹雪: (Akita Inu) Yamato's father, and legendary Yokozuna fighting dog owned and trained by Zenkichi.

He fell out of the back of a truck, where he was on his own in the wilderness for a few days. Yamato eventually saved him from becoming an eagle's meal and brought him home, where Ryō's family nurses him back to health and adopts him. His original family eventually comes to take him back, greatly upsetting everyone. At home, Musashi is regularly beat up by his siblings, and his mother when he tries to fight back, so he runs away for good, risking his life in the wilderness to make his way back to Yamato's family. He is very brave, and defends Yamato as often as Yamato protects him. ;White Wolf - ホワイトウルフ: The boss of a stray pack that used to oppose Black Satan before Yamato defeated him. He appears later to save Musashi from Red Killer, losing his leg in the process, and is considered one of Yamato's friends after that. ;Tosaō - 土佐王: (Tosa Inu) Greatest Yokozuna of all.

Tarōmaru is killed by one of Toshio's dogs, inspiring the remaining three's revenge against him. ;Tsurugi - 剣: (Akita Inu) A veteran Akita fighting dog. Tsurugi has a mysterious fighting style in which he clouds the ring with dust. As the view gets foggy, he attacks his opponent, and leaves only scratches that seem like no damage at all. But as soon as the opponent lunges, all the wounds open fully, and the dog is instantly covered in blood. ;Londo - ロンドー: (Great Dane) Antagonist dogs ;Bruiser - ブルーザ: (Boxer) ;Big Hunter - ビッグハンター: (German Shepherd) ;Sahara - 沙覇羅: (African wild dog) ;Blackey - ブラッキー: (Doberman Pinscher/Mastiff mix) ;Blackhead Sniper - ブラックヘッドスナイパー: (Tosa Inu) ;Kabuki - 歌舞伎: (Tosa Inu) ;Tekkimen - 鉄鬼面: (Tosa Inu) ;Bodybuilder - ボディービルダー: (Tosa Inu) ;Bayern/Bavaria - バイエルン: (German Shepherd) Owned by Neo-Nazi father-and-son-team.

The other municipal neighbours of Mariposa are Ops and Fenelon on the east, Eldon on the north, Brock on the west, and Scugog on the south, with the latter two located in the Durham Regional Municipality. The former township includes the communities of Little Britain, Manilla, Mariposa, Valentia, and Oakwood. Today, most of the former township is represented in the City of Kawartha Lakes by the Ward 8 Councillor, John Pollard, and Ward 4 Councillor Andrew Veale. History Mariposa is the Spanish word for \\"butterfly\\" (see mariposa). No record or even legend persists to explain through what whim of early officialdom a backwoods township was so named. The mariposa township was surveyed in 1820 and formally attached to Durham County, Newcastle District in 1821. In shape, it was originally a rectangle, nine miles from east to west and fifteen from north to south. There was added to it later, however, a broken southern front on Lake Scugog, now known as concessions A, B, C, and D, Mariposa, but formerly attached to the township of Cartwright, which now lies entirely on the south side of the lake. Its superficial area is 75,102 acres. The land surface is moderately undulating, with a very immature drainage system. The chief stream, the Mariposa Brook, (also known variously as Big Creek, Black Creek, Davidson's Creek, and West Cross Creek) rises in swamps near Manilla on the western boundary, flows eight miles northeast to about Lot 18, Concession 13, then turns directly south until it passes Little Britain on Concession 4, and finally turns, east to pass out of the township on the 3rd Concession and empty into the Scugog River in Ops. The meagre flow and gentle current of even this main stream and the consequent lack of any considerable water power is beyond doubt the explanation for the absence of any outstanding village in Mariposa. The soil, however has always surpassed in richness that of any other township in Victoria. Once the heavy timber had been removed, it held, as it still holds, an easy leadership in agricultural prosperity in the former Victoria County. This well-known fertility of the township resulted in the blocking of general settlement until nearly a decade after the major immigration into Emily. For the Canada Company secured large concessions here; George Strange Boulton of Port Hope, the Family Compact member for Durham, arranged for a rich grant to himself. For many years, Mariposa was visited annually by these economic parasites, who came in to inspect and invest for speculation, but not to occupy the land. At last in 1827, S. Patterson, of Markham, Ontario, settled near the modern Manilla. Others who located prior to 1830 on land near Manilla which they purchased from the Canada Company at from $1.50 to $2.00 per acre were the Ewings, McLeods, Houghs, McPhersons, Pillings, and Winters. Just before and during 1831, a large contingent of Scotch settlers, chiefly from Argyleshire, poured in along the Eldon boundary on the north. Amongst the families who overflowed on the south side of the line were the Blacks, Calkins, Campbells, Charltons, Copelands, Grants, Irishes, Kinnells, McCrimmons, McCuaigs, McGinnisses, McLeans, Ringlands, Spences and Wicks. In 1831, also, the Edwards and Williams families took up land along the western boundary and one Samuel Dick built his cabin in the hardwood forest near the site of modern Oakwood. His nearest neighbours on the east were at Purdy's Mills (now Lindsay), nearly nine miles away. In this same year, when actual settlers began to increase and set about the improvement of the land, the swarm of speculators became so 'numerous and importunate that the Land Office refused to grant any further locations without an express pledge of settlement. Fortunately, men were not lacking to undertake such pledges. For the next three years, there was a steady immigration of settlers of the very best type, chiefly Canadian born pioneers of the second generation whose fathers had hewn out prosperity in the front townships of Northumberland County and in the former Ontario County townships of Whitchurch and Markham. Most of these families settled in the centre of the township, along the Mariposa Brook. Amongst them were the Armitages, Bacons, Bunnells, Davidsons, DeGeers, Delongs, Dundases, Haights, Hubbells, Lakes, Lloyds, Marks, Minthorns, McNeils, McWilliams, O'Brien's, Penroses, Piersons, Pogues, Readers, Richardsons, Roadhouses, Taylors, Tifts, Waites and Weldons. From 1834 to 1837 a few more families drifted in each year. Prominent amongst those who settled in the eastern part of the township were William Brown, William Bowes, and John Cruse, a Quaker. For many years yet there was little or no communication between the Canadian born settlers in the centre of Mariposa and their Scotch neighbours on the northern border, for a deep tract of difficult forest, held by speculators, intervened. There were likewise very few early settlers in the extreme south of the township. These pioneers in Mariposa came in from the south and southwest and not via Peterborough, Cavan, or Emily. Supplies were first obtained from Newmarket, then from Prince Albert, on Lake Scugog, and finally from Port Perry. Trade was not opened up with Lindsay until very much later. In the beginning, the nearest post office for the receipt and despatch of mails was at Butcher's Point on Lake Simcoe. Then Prince Albert was for a short time the closest centre for mail, until \\"Mariposa\\" post office was opened at what is now Manilla. By 1850 the population of the township had risen to 1863, only 269 fewer than in 1920. The harvest of that year included 70,000 bushels of wheat, 41,000 bushels of oats, 14,000 bushels of peas, 33,000 bushels of potatoes, 31,000 bushels of turnips, 38,900 pounds (ca. 18 t) of maple sugar, 10,500 pounds (ca. 5 t) of wool, and 4,000 pounds (1.81 t) of butter. This represented, however, only a small portion of the effort of that day, for the great task of each farmer was still the conquest of a virgin forest of oak and maple. Such crops as were exported were teamed in the winter time south to a village (now deserted) called Port Hoover, on the north shore of Lake Scugog, thence across the lake to Caesarea, in Scugog, and south by road to Port Whitby, on Lake Ontario. Municipal organization in the early thirties was very slight. Louis Winters was the first tax collector and E. R. Irish the first Township Clerk. The personnel of the Magistrate's Court for Mariposa and Eldon combined comprised Messrs. Irish, Ewing, Williams, and Calkins. Samuel Davidson represented Mariposa at Peterborough on the first Council of Colborne District in 1842. The first Township Council after the Municipal Act of 1849 included: *Reeve, John Jacobs; *Councillors, Samuel Davidson, Obadiah Rogers, Robert Whiteside, and William Ramsey; *Clerk, A. A. McLaughlin; *Treasurer, James Thorndyke. A Business Directory of Canada published in 1850, gives the following names in Mariposa: ;Coulter's Corners (now Manilla) *Mary Douglas, Postmistress; *George Smith, merchant; *L. McKinnon, carpenter; *D. McLean, carpenter ;Oakwood: *A. A. McLauchlin, Postmaster and inn keeper; *Thomas Marks, inn keeper. The Dominion census of 1911 throws interesting light on the population of Mariposa. The chief racial strains represented were: *English, 2,321 *Irish, 733 *Scottish, 646 The denominational subdivisions were as follows: *Methodists, 2,678 *Presbyterians, 757 *Anglicans, 125 *Christians, 114 *Baptists, 43 *Roman Catholics, 28 The population of Mariposa has fallen off remarkably during the last generation. From 1871 to 1920, it dropped from 5363 to 3132, a loss of 2231 or over 41 per cent. The assessed value of real and personal property within the township was set at $2,480,675 in 1886 and at $3,722,995 in 1920. This latter figure is greater than the assessment of Eldon and Emily combined, and more than twice the total value of Somerville, Bexley, Laxton, Carden, Digby, Dalton and Longford. Communities Mariposa is easily the most fertile township in Kawartha Lakes. It lacks, however, two of the most efficient factors in the development of village life. There is no abundance of waterpower and no focusing of railroads. The old Indian portage of Onigoning at the rapids in the Scugog River in Ops has had both and has therefore become the site of Lindsay, the only town in the county. In Mariposa, on the contrary, there have been three small villages, Manilla, Oakwood and Little Britain, none of them incorporated, which have grown up around a post office, a township hall and a small mill respectively. Woodville is an incorporated village on the Eldon boundary but is usually reckoned as belonging to the latter township, even though part of its population has spilled over on the 15th concession of Mariposa. Linden Valley in the northeast, Glandine on the Ops boundary, Valenta in the southeast and Fingerboard in the southwest are former postal hamlets with little more than a church and a smithy. Cresswell is a hamlet on the Whitby-Lindsay division just south of Manilla Junction. Grass Hill is a station on the Coboconk division at the Eldon boundary. A grain warehouse is its chief ornament Manilla Manilla Manilla straddles the boundary between Durham Region and the City of Kawartha Lakes on the line between the 8th and 9th Concessions of Mariposa. The beginnings of present village was due to the Post Office that opened up here in 1837 in the log store of Jacob Ham. For six years this was the only Post Office for the township. Soon afterwards the Bible Christians built a church, which was rebuilt of brick in 1871. The Presbyterians built in 1853, the Baptists in 1856, the Congregationalists in 1860, and the Methodists about 1870. A certain amount of trade and industry also gathered about this centre. In 1881 the village boasted a flour mill, run by steam because of the absence of waterpower, a rake factory, and half a dozen stores. The community went through a succession of names: Ham's Corners after Jacob Ham, the first merchant; Mariposa in 1836; Coulthard's Corners after Thomas Coulthard, who platted a subdivision; and Monticello after a local bible camp. Finally in 1851, a public meeting chose to name the town after Manilla, Indiana. Oakwood Oakwood is situated on blocks off lots 15 and 16 in concessions 8 and 9. The name is derived from the heavy forest of oak which originally covered this neighbourhood. James Tift settled here about 1833 and may therefore be regarded as the father of the village. In 1843 a Post Office was established with A. McLauchlin as Postmaster. Peter Perry of Whitby opened a store in 1844 and in the following year a Township Hall was built. The Hall has been rebuilt once since that time, but has never ceased to be the municipal focus of the former township. The first tavern or hotel at Oakwood was run by Thomas Marks Banks, who carried on the business for nearly twenty years. The first church was built by the Bible Christians in 1850. The Episcopal Methodists built five years later, the Canada Methodists in 1858, and the Anglicans in 1860. Oakwood reached the peak of its prosperity in the 1880s. In 1888 its population was about 330. Of that number, there were 75 children between the ages of seven and eleven and 127 between the ages of five and twenty-one. Oakwood took just pride in her young people in those days. The chief business firm in 1888 was the general store of Hogg Bros., with which was associated a 30,000 bushel grain elevator at Mariposa Station, a mile to the south from the village. To this elevator came Mariposa's export trade in cereals, and its clover seed, which has gained a wide reputation. Hogg Bros. also managed the Post Office and telegraph office. Other units in the commercial aggregate were A. Cameron's general store, M. N. Anderson's tailor shop, William Brunker's hotel, Alfred Lake's machinery depot, Thomas Staples' blacksmith and carriage works, Nicholas Hill's blacksmith and carriage works, George Humphrey's carriage works, W. H. Harper's harness shop, and Robert Broad's hardware store. Prominent citizens of that day were, James Thorndyke, J. F. Cunnings, Robert Webster, Sr., William Webster, Jesse Weldon, Sr., W. A. Silverwood, John Coad, David King, Richard Hancock, and A. Lake. The first mile of concession road east from the village is bisected at right angles by Mariposa Brook at what is known as East Oakwood. The neighbourhood of this intersection, was once busy with tanning and gristing, but by 1888 a brick yard and a livery stable were all its boast. The next cross roads to the east again was known as Taylor's Corners. Here the Hon. S. C. Wood, before the days of his political bloom, did business in \\"The Stone Store.\\" In the eighties John Maunder and William Wakeley manufactured wagons and carriages here. Little Britain Little Britain Little Britain is on lots 15 and 16, concessions 4 and 5, four miles straight south of Oakwood on the old grain route to Port Hoover. It is built almost at the intersection of Mariposa Brook and a small tributary which flows through the village from the west. It was founded by Harrison Haight, who settled here in 1834 and three years later built the first mill in Mariposa. This mill, which was not demolished until 1910, required the efforts of nearly the whole country side for its erection, for its beams and posts were of ponderous white oak. (Two living examples of these gigantic original trees still living can be seen today on Salem Road around lot 13). In the mid 19th century there was no bridge over the creek and no road between Little Britain and Oakwood. Robert F. Whiteside was the village's chief merchant and leading citizen during the pioneer period. In 1850 the Christians opened a church and in 1852 the Bible Christians followed suit. A Post Office was not opened until 1853. The year 1888 saw Little Britain the largest business centre in the township. The chief industries were: Joseph Maunder's carriage and blacksmithing works; Wm. Burden's carriage and blacksmithing works; Maunder's sash, door and planing factory and shingle mill; Edwin Mark's foundry and implement works; Isaac Finley's steam roller flour mill, and Davidson's flour mill. W. H. Pogue, S. H. Metherell, J. Weldon, and T. H. Morton ran general stores. T. H. Morton also had the Post Office. H. C. Wills owned a grocery store and also ran the stage to Mariposa Station. A. M. Rusland had a tinware store, R. Smith a furniture store, S. Champion a tailor shop, and both Wm. Rodd and John Eck harness shops. Joseph Jenkins ran the village hotel. The chief sanctuaries were the large Methodist church on Mill Street West, presided over by the Rev. William Briden and his assistant, the Rev. S. H. Anderson, and the Christian church, tended by the Rev. J. C. Pilkie. Prominent among the pioneer names in and about Little Britain are those of Broad, Cory, Davidson, Dix, Eakins, Glass, Glennie, Greenaway, Hall, Henderson, Johnston, King, Marks, Metherell, Netherton, Parkinson, Prouse, Rays, Rodman, Siemmon, Stewart, Wallis, Webster, Whiteside, and Wickett. None of these three villages, Manilla, Oakwood, and Little Britain, have attained dimensions sufficient to command incorporation. The reason, as already suggested, lies in the absence of power for industry and in the fact that no railway station has been placed within a mile of their borders. Whether this represents the balanced result of village plotting and counter plotting in the days of railway construction, or whether the railway builders were inadequately bonused, or whether the present route of the Whitby-Lindsay division was the necessary choice of civil engineers, is somewhat uncertain. In any case, the railway has contributed nothing to the growth of these centres. Mariposa The township centre was located by the Victoria/Kawartha Lakes Road 6 (Eldon Road) and the former Grand Trunk Railway. The CBD was home to the centrally located Mariposa Station between Oakwood and Little Britain. It was formerly part of Victoria County, it is currently part of the one-tier City of Kawartha Lakes. Until the creation of Kawartha Lakes and the consequent disbandment of Victoria County and its constituent municipalities, Mariposa Township was also a political as well as a geographical township.  In popular culture  Stephen Leacock, McGill University political economy professor and humorist, spent about a decade of his childhood in Egypt, Ontario in Georgina Township about 20 kilometres away from Mariposa. After being hired at McGill, he also bought a summer home across Lake Simcoe in Orillia which was near Mariposa Beach. When Leacock wrote Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town, the subject matter was provided by Orillia and thinly disguised. He named his fictional town Mariposa, inspired by some or all of the real Mariposas he had been acquainted with. The Mariposa Folk Festival is named after the fictional town and not any of the real places. Thus, the fictional meaning has almost completely supplanted the original meaning of what had been real places.  Notable people  * W. G. Hardy (1895 – 1979), Born in Peniel, near Oakwood.

In 1858, this law was changed, and Offenbach was able to offer full-length operettas, beginning with Orpheus in the Underworld.

Early history  The history of the Geological Sciences at Athens University until the year 1982 and the institutional change of the law 1268, is identified with the history of the Chairs and the Professors that taught and is described further below. Professor K. Mitsopoulos taught the lesson of Mineralogy till 1910, while in the year 1896 the Laboratory and the Museum of Mineralogy and Petrology are founded. In 1910, K. Ktenas is elected as professor for the homonymous Chair and he teaches until his death in 1935. In 1936, G. Georgalas is elected in his place and he stays in this position until 1946. After him, An. Georgiadis (1946–1965) and Gr. Marakis (1973–1994) are also elected as professors. The Chair of Geology and Palaeontology as well as the homonymous Laboratory and Museum are founded by professor Th. Skoufos after his appointment in the chair mentioned in 1906. He enriched the Laboratory and the Museum with fossils as training material for students and as material for the collection of the museum exhibition, through many excavations realized in various places around Greece. After Professor Skoufos (1906–1936), Professor M. Mitsopoulos becomes Head of the Laboratory and the Museum and later on G. Marinos (1969–1974) after being called in from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Professor N. Symeonidis takes over in 1975 and stays head of the Laboratory until 1998. The Chair of Physical Geography and the corresponding laboratory is founded in 1931 and is initially located at the Athens Observatory. Professor I. Trikkalinos is head of the Laboratory until 1958. Later on P. Psarianos is elected as Professor (1959–1974) and then Ath. Papapetrou-Zamani, initially as Associate professor and then as Professor (1975–1997). In the year 1931 the Chair of Seismology and the corresponding laboratory is founded with Professor N. Kritikos (1930–1947) as head of the Laboratory, which is initially located at the Athens Observatory. Later on A. Galanopoulos (1949–1978) and I. Drakopoulos (1979–1999) were elected. The Chair of Ore Geology and the corresponding Laboratory are founded in 1961 and the elected Professor G. Paraskevopoulos taught until his death in 1983.  Departments  According to the law 1268/82 the School of Sciences is founded, which also includes the Faculty of Geology. The previously mentioned Chairs were annulled and the following Departments were created and still exist to this day: *Department of Mineralogy and Petrology *Department of Historical Geology and Palaeontology *Department of Geography and Climatology *Department of Geophysics and Geothermics *Department of Economical Geology and Geochemistry *Department of Dynamic, Tectonic and Applied Geology  Laboratories  *Laboratory of Mineralogy and Petrology *Laboratory of Historical Geology and Palaeontology *Laboratory of Physical Geography *Laboratory of Climatology *Laboratory of Seismology *Laboratory of Economical Geology and Geochemistry *Laboratory of Tectonics and Geological mapping *Laboratory of Remote Sensing *Laboratory of Geophysics *Laboratory of Prevention and Management of Natural Disasters  Professors Emeriti  *Athina Papapetrou Zamani Professor of Physical Geography *Nikolaos Simeonidis Professor of Geology and Palaeontology *Ioannis Zampakas Professor of Climatology *Sotirios Leontaris Professor of Physical Geography *Ilias Mariolakos Professor of Geology and Palaeontology *Stylianos Skounakis Professor of Economic Geology *Nikolaos Delimpasis Professor of Seismology *Konstantinos Sideris Professor of Mineralogy and Petrology  Postgraduate courses  Within the framework of the postgraduate studies program of the Faculty of Geology the following two year courses are offered: *Geochemical Environmental Pollution *Stratigraphy - Palaeontology *Mineral Sciences *Geography and Environment *Dynamic Tectonic and Applied Geology *Geophysics - Seismology *Prevention and Management of Natural Disasters as well as the inter-faculty Postgraduate Study Program in Oceanography in which the following faculties are involved: Geology, Biology, Physics, Chemistry.

The usual type of error was perpetrated in the Committee on Privileges of the British House of Lords, whether by the Committee itself or by a clerk, in mistaking the origins of a dormant, abeyant, or extinct title, and in awarding that title to a person who was not the heir to that peerage. Such mistakes are rare. One such error was made when the barony of Wharton was conferred upon a claimant, believing that the barony had been created by writ of summons; however, the original barony had been created by letters patent to the heirs male of the original grantee. In this case, the original documentation had been lost. As a result, a new barony in the peerage of the United Kingdom was created by writ. Similar errors were made for the Percy barony when the 7th Duke of Somerset was summoned to Parliament erroneously in 1722 as Baron Percy (in the belief that the 1299 barony had descended to his mother), and the Strange barony created in 1628 for the 7th Earl of Derby by error. Another example is the barony of Clifford created by the writ of summons to Henry Clifford in 1628: this was intended as a writ of acceleration in the belief that the Baron de Clifford title created in 1299 was held by his father Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland.GEC, ed. Vicary Gibbs and H. Arthur Doubleday, The Complete Peerage, volume III (London, 1913) pages 301 and 569. Since the early 20th century, the Committee on Privileges has been reluctant to revive older English baronies on various grounds, and thus opportunities for new baronies to be created by clerical error or failure in research are rare. Other errors The most famous error made by the House of Lords in awarding a title was not in the case of a barony, but for the Scottish earldom of Mar which was awarded to a distant collateral heir male of a previous earl, and not to the heir general, as customary under Scottish peerage law. This 1875 Committee finding declared that a separate Scottish earldom with remainder to heirs male had been created in 1565, and in 1885 an Act of Parliament revived the ancient title for the heir general. As a result, there are two peers holding the Mar title today; the Countess of Mar (holder of the oldest surviving Scottish peerage) and the Earl of Mar and Kellie. The most common errors are made in the spelling of a title as granted in letters patent. This category does not include baronies such as the very old English Barony de Ros or the Barony of Hastings that were awarded to persons who were not the senior heir (or co-heir) general. Nor does it include baronies that were not awarded at all to the claimant, for various other reasons.

It is based in the Longbridges boathouse on the Isis, which is owned by the college and shared with St Hilda's, St Catz, Green Templeton, and Mansfield. The club was affiliated with Templeton College until 2008, when the latter merged to form a new college, Green Templeton College with its own boat club. History The Early Days of the Boat Club Hertford College's 1954 1st Torpid chasing St. Catz The years after the re-foundation of the College were among the golden years of the college boat club.Goudie, Andrew Seven Hundred Years of an Oxford College (Hertford College 1284-1984) Hertford College, 1984 Hertford College was in 1874 re-founded as the new embodiment of Magdalen Hall, which was absorbed by it - (all its members being incorporated, and its buildings occupied by Hertford College). The 'Blue- Black' of the Hall had, as far as O.U.B.C. races are concerned, disappeared from the river in 1873 when their Eight was bumped over two places by Worcester College. The new Boat Club was really properly started in October 1875, when the first Captain (A. F. Thornhill) was elected - and the new colours (crimson and white) of the College made their appearance on the River in the following term when the first Torpid was put on. The debut gave some promise but was not very successful as having to change a man in the middle of the races the boat lost the two places it had gained - and here one may remark that one is at loss to account for the want of success which has always attended our Torpids, only one of them ever having risen, while the Eight has gone steadily from 20th to Head of the River in 1881. In this last Eight there were first hands recruited from the Torpid. The first Eight made its appearance in May 1876, and rose four places. After this we have only to chronicle success. The Eight starting nineteenth in 1878, rose in that year six places to thirteenth - in 1879 five places to eighth - in 1880 three places to fifth - and in 1881 with five new hands when everything looked worst we rose the remaining four places 'Head of the River'. Hertford College's 1954 1st Torpid bumping Christ Church Through the energy of the Principal (Dr. Boyd) the College in November, 1878, became possessors of a Barge, which no doubt has been very conductive to our success. As to financial matters one cannot speak with so much pleasure and satisfaction for up till quite a recent date the College has not really been large enough to support its success which has entailed a somewhat heavy expenditure. But as the College has grown considerably and as efforts have been and are being made to clear off the debt that remains, it is hoped that we shall soon be able to speak of the Club as a financial success. One consequence of being Head of the River in 1881 was that Hertford burnt its boats. The following letter was sent to T. G. Jackson, whilst he was engaged on the restoration of the Bodleian Library. It was sent by Mr Madden, sub-librarian: Paul Mattick wins gold at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich Recent Years 1997 saw the opening of new Longbridges boathouse, which replaced the older boathouse on the same site. The club room is the ideal place to get a sense of the history of the club: adorning the walls are the names of former club captains and presidents, former blues (those who have represented Oxford against Cambridge in The Boat Race, or the Henley Boat Races, and 'champions', the most notable of whom is Paul Mattick, who as part of the GB Lightweight Men's 4- crew, won gold in an extremely tight race at the 2010 World Rowing Championships in New Zealand. He was previously a world champion in the same boat class in 2007, and finished 5th in the Olympic final in Beijing. Paul began rowing at Hertford and maintains strong ties to the boat club, continuing to have a coaching input. The club is also immensely proud of Steph Cullen and Zoe Lee, both of whom also learnt to row at Hertford and who have gone on to represent Great Britain. Steph became World Champion in the women's lightweight quadruple sculls event, while Zoe is currently a member of the women's eight. The years since the construction of the boat house have been highly successful with both the men's and women's sides achieving numerous sets of blades (bumping up on every day of Torpids or Summer Eights). The most recent of these occurred in 2015, when both the men's and women's first eights won blades in Torpids (a first in the college's history). View of the devastation following the fire at the Longbridges boathouse in 2005 The Fire On Monday 4 July 2005 the Longbridges Boathouse that accommodates Hertford and several other college boat clubs was damaged by fire. In an incident that the police identified as arson, the building was undamaged, but twenty-six boats were destroyed by the heat of the fire. The boat storage area as well as two clubrooms suffered severe smoke damage. Upon investigation the cause of the fire was attributed to incendiary devices which had been placed in the boat bays.

A well- known libertarian labour militante, she remained active in the movement well into her old age. She dedicated a major part of her life to the Swedish syndicalist movement, being particularly active in the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden (SAC), where she rose to become the union's first International Secretary (1968—1972) and engaged herself in practical solidarity work for the then-underground anarcho-syndicalist movements on the Iberian peninsula. She also played an important role in revitalizing the Swedish Syndicalist League of Women, which, up until then, had been relegated to a relatively minor role by the male-dominated movement. As a writer, she contributed with journalistic pieces in SAC's weekly, the Arbetaren, later also becoming an important figure for the Swedish New Left and a regular contributor to the main theoretical journal of the Swedish anarchist movement, Frihetlig Socialistisk Tidskrift (\\"Libertarian Socialist Magazine\\"). Over the years she published several books; biographies, historical reports, and theoretical works, all of which had a major influence on the Swedish syndicalist movement, and thanks to her translations of works by Michel Foucault she made a lasting imprint on the larger social debate.  Life and career  Britta Gröndahl was born to right-wing accountant and local politician Hans Maartman and his wife, Dagmar Tideman, who hailed from a more proletarian type peasant background. In 1931, Gröndahl was one of the few women to get a grammar school degree in Latin, but despite this, she never went on to fulfill her dreams of studying Political Science, as this was not considered the appropriate thing for a woman to do. After further pursuing her language studies instead, she eventually met the cellist and son of a foundryman, Gustav Gröndahl, whom she married in 1936. The cellist had a great influence in her taste in music, and their circle of friends was at the time almost exclusively made up of musicians. But her interests were not exclusively with music and literature. In the 1950s she started getting thoroughly acquainted with the history of libertarian socialism, and at the end of the decade her first book was published, a biography of the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, subtitled \\"Socialist, federalist, anarchist\\". Thanks to this and later studies on the Industrial Workers of the World and writers such as Simone Weil, she soon came to be regarded as a serious-minded and thorough historian and journalist. After being taken on by other leading lights of the anarcho-syndicalist movement in Sweden – people like Helmut Rüdiger or the then secretary-general (of both the SAC and the International Workers Association) John Andersson, as well as Augustin Souchy, a German anarchist refugee who spent time in Sweden during World War I and eventually ending up in Mexican exile and often visiting Sweden – Gröndahl travelled to Spain for the first time in 1962. This was a country where the libertarian socialist movement was deeply rooted in the popular classes, and she eventually came to play an important role as a link between SAC and the libertarian unions now operating underground in both Spain and Portugal. In her memoirs she relates how she, amongst other thing, acted as a courier, smuggling large sums of money into Francoist Spain in order to turn them over to the clandestine Confederación Nacional del Trabajo. Later she worked as a correspondent for Arbetaren in Paris during the May 1968 events in France, with her reports on the emerging 'anarchist-marxist' movement contributing to rekindling the anarchist spirit of Swedish youths and students. As the International Secretary of the SAC, her home was often open to anarchist refugees from countries such as Italy and France. In 1974 she witnessed and reported on the Carnation Revolution in Portugal. During the 1970s she mainly dedicated herself to working as a free-lance translator, a trade which she had already practiced for 10 years during the '40s and '50s. Especially important among her works during this later period was Swedish translation of The History of Sexuality. Aside from the works of Michel Foucault, she also translated six books by Marie Cardinal as well as many of the adult comic albums written by Claire Bretecher, all published in Sweden during the 1980s. She continued covering the foreign anarchist press in a column in Arbetaren well into her retirement. Later on, only her ill health prevented her from taking part in the Stockholm anarcho-syndicalist May Day celebrations.  Bibliography  * Här talar syndikalisterna (1973) * Parti eller fackförening?

Founded in 2006, the organization funds the final stages of research and development of new drugs, diagnostics and disease- prevention tools, helps produce data supporting guidelines for their use, and works to allow more affordable generic medicines to enter the marketplace in low- and middle-income countries. Hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Unitaid was established by the governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom.https://unitaid.org/about-us/#en As of 2019, Unitaid manages a portfolio of 48 grants worth around US$1.3 billion. More than half of Unitaid's projects contribute to the global fight against antimicrobial resistance.https://unitaid.org/annual-report-18-19/ Unitaid supports programs that are implemented by organizations such as Coalition Plus, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Expertise France, The Global Fund, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, Médecins Sans Frontières, Medicines for Malaria Venture, Stop TB Partnership, TB Alliance, UNICEF and others. Areas of work * Unitaid and partners have brought new, affordable HIV medicines to people in Africa in three years, three times faster than for previous generations of antiretrovirals. Further reductions in prices are expected to save the global health response US$300 million each year. * Unitaid and partners have revolutionized childhood TB treatment with quality paediatric medicines that are affordable and taste good. Unitaid is also investing in better approaches to help find the one million children affected by TB each year, and to identify drug-resistant strains of TB in patients with genome-based diagnostic technologies. * The Unitaid-supported ACCESS-SMC pilot project (2014-2018) demonstrated that providing small children with oral medication during the rainy season in Africa's Sahel region protects against malaria, and that the strategy is feasible and cost effective. As the result of the project, 12 countries were delivering seasonal malaria chemoprevention as of mid-2019. * Unitaid and its partners are finding new ways to manage and mitigate mosquitoes' resistance to insecticide with the first long-lasting insecticides recommended by WHO in 40 years, new bed nets, anti-parasitic drugs, and treated plastic sheets that drive mosquitoes away from where people live. * Unitaid and partners have succeeded in introducing quality-assured, affordable self-testing kits across Africa in the space of three years. Fifty-nine countries now have policies on HIV self-testing. * In 2010, Unitaid created and invested in the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to negotiate voluntary licenses for HIV medicines. MPP's work helped bring about the widespread use of tenofovir for HIV treatment, which resulted in a savings of $195 million in drug costs between 2012 and 2015.April, 2016 report: Unitaid at 10:Innovation in Global Health\\" Financing * Unitaid’s main donors are France, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Brazil, Spain, the Republic of Korea, and Chile.https://unitaid.org/assets/HCV- factsheet-24-7-19.pdf The single main source of income is an airline ticket tax currently in effect in ten countries: Cameroon, Chile, Congo, France, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Niger and the Republic of Korea.

MacKenzie\\" is a lament written and sung by Joseph Kilna MacKenzie, in memory of his great-grandfather who was killed in combat during World War I. It has been used in the 2002 movie We Were Soldiers and the ending scene of the 2012 film End of Watch. History Joseph MacKenzie wrote the haunting lament after the death of his wife, Christine, and in memory of his great- grandfather, Charles Stuart MacKenzie, a sergeant in the Seaforth Highlanders, who along with hundreds of his brothers-in-arms from the Elgin-Rothes area in Moray, Scotland went to fight in World War I. Sergeant MacKenzie was bayoneted to death at age 33, while defending one of his badly injured fellow soldiers during hand-to-hand trench warfare. His grave stone states that he died on 9 April 1917. The track was then included in his band Clann An Drumma's album Tried and True (2001). While working on the film We Were Soldiers (2002), director Randall Wallace received a CD of the album and was haunted by the emotion and spirit of reverence captured in \\"Sgt. MacKenzie\\". He arranged for Joe and his bandmate Donnie MacNeil, who played the pipes, to re-record \\"Sgt. MacKenzie\\" with the backing of an 80-piece orchestra and the United States Military Academy Choir at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. The lament was introduced into the film during key scenes, with MacKenzie singing on his own, and on the last track of the film with the orchestra and choir. It is mistakenly believed the original version was in Scottish (Gaelic), but it was in Scots. The original pipe score was written and played by Seoras Wallace, when Joe MacKenzie read his poem to him and Tu-Bardh Wilson in a house in Govan many years ago. The original recording is on the ClanWallace live album, and it was this recording that inspired Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson to contact Seoras about using the track on the film We Were Soldiers (2002). Seoras waived his rights but remains the holder of the production rights returned to him three years after the film's release. Sgt. Charles Stuart MacKenzie Sgt. Charles Stuart MacKenzie went to fight in France during World War I and was shot in the shoulder. The military sent him home to Scotland for treatment, where the surgeon wanted to amputate his arm. Sgt. MacKenzie refused, stating that he had to go back to his men. While recuperating in the hospital, he was asked what it was like to kill \\"the Hun\\" (as the Germans were called then). He replied, \\"what a waste of a fine body of men\\". His last picture, with him in uniform, was taken on the steps of the hospital. This picture hung in his home above the fireplace. Upon his return to the front, he and his men were engaged in fixed bayonet combat. The composer says, In later works Child actor Atticus Shaffer was interested in the story of the actual soldier, so he dressed up as MacKenzie on Halloween. This was incorporated into his character, Brick, on The Middle, who does the same in a Halloween episode, then writes a hip-hop musical in a later episode based on MacKenzie's life and inspired by the hit Broadway musical Hamilton. Beside the 2002 movie We Were Soldiers, the original song was also played during a scene in the film End of Watch (2012), starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. External links * Sgt.

The story comprises the adventures of a British doctor, recovering from tuberculosis, who goes to stay at a Derbyshire farm looking for rest and relaxation, becomes entrapped in a series of sinister events, and is forced to uncover the mysteries surrounding \\"Blue John Gap\\" and the \\"Terror\\" that lurks within it. Plot summary Dr James Hardcastle, who is convalescing in a Derbyshire farm, discovers Blue John Gap, a Roman Derbyshire Blue John mine. He begins to investigate the mine and the extensive underground formations to which it connects, despite the warnings of a local farmer who claims it contains a monster that has been stealing his sheep. Hardcastle hears a large creature moving in the cave, and uncovers more evidence that it has been preying on local sheep. He determines to face it alone, as the colleagues whom he asked for help dismissed his claims as madness. He manages to wound the creature, and is badly hurt himself doing so. The local people, who believe Hardcastle, seal the mine after the creature has returned to it. Hardcastle dies from trauma, leaving a description of his experience to try to convince his London colleagues.  Themes  One of the central themes of The Terror of Blue John Gap is Hardcastle's difficulty in getting the world to believe him. This theme is mirrored with Conan Doyle's other character, Professor Challenger's struggles to get the world to believe the truth of his adventures in The Lost World (the creature in The Terror of Blue John Gap is a prehistoric survivor like the creatures in The Lost World). It also echoes Conan Doyle's career as a campaigner for various causes such as the atrocities in the Congo and spiritualism where he was met with denial in the former case and doubt in the latter. In that respect Philip Gooden theorises that Dr James Hardcastle, and Professor Challenger, who boldly prove the scientific community wrong, may have been a wish fulfillment on Doyle's part.  Characters  * Dr James Hardcastle The hero of the story. A doctor who, while recovering from tuberculosis, discovers the mystery of Blue John Gap and bravely resolves to solve it alone when the world scorns him. While he emerged triumphant the ordeal left him a broken man. He died on 4 February 1908 in South Kensington. * Armitage A young sheep farmer. He was the one who first introduced Dr Hardcastle to the sinister goings on around Blue John Gap. He later vanishes without a trace and is presumed to have been killed by the \\"Terror\\". * The Miss Allertons Two elderly sister spinsters. They run the farm and inn where Hardcastle is sent to recover from his illness. They are described as quaint with hearts of gold. * Dr Mark Johnson A friend of Professor Saunderson. Hardcastle turns to him for help and he promptly sent Hardcastle to Picton's asylum as a result. * Professor Saunderson Hardcastle's Doctor. He was the one who recommended Miss Allerton's farm as a place for Hardcastle to recover and apparently grew up there himself. * Seaton A friend of Hardcastle. Hardcastle addressed his notes of the events to him. Enquiry apparently failed to identify who Seaton was and his identity, and even existence, remained a mystery.  Locations  * Miss Allerton's farm the place in Derbyshire where Hardcastle was sent to recover from illness. The farm is above sea level and surrounded by limestone cliffs and hills. Professor Saunderson was \\"not above scaring crows in those very fields.\\"The Terror of Blue John Gap, chapter 1 * Blue John Gap a mine, one of only two in the world where the beautiful and rare Blue John mineral is found. The Romans created the mine and, in the process, their shaft intersected into the great water-worn caves of the underworld. * Underworld Hardcastle discovers that the limestone hills are hollow; \\"Strike it with some gigantic hammer it would boom like a drum.\\" Inside, he theorised, is a huge subterranean sea. The evaporation from this sea supports a forest and animal life, which entered the caves from the surface and became trapped when the caves were cut off. Since then they have evolved into the creature Hardcastle encountered.

He captained Ulster to two Railway Cups and also won two others. He won three SFCs with his native Roslea Shamrocks as well as three (in three years!) in Antrim with St John’s, Belfast. With the latter, he won an Ulster club championship and played in an All-Ireland club final. He played for his county at under 21 level for five years, winning two Ulster championships and contesting back-to-back All- Ireland finals. He also played in two Ulster minor deciders. October 1953: Peter McGinnity is born in Roslea, County Fermanagh. Fast-forward almost 45 years to autumn 1998: he plays his last game of football, helping his club win an intermediate championship final . . . an incredible 30 years after first donning the colours of the south county club. Peter was only 14 when he broke onto the Roslea first team in 1968. He spent virtually his entire club career with the Shamrocks, apart from three years in Belfast with St John’s, 1976-79. The IFC garnered in ’98 was McGinnity’s second, his first adult success with Roslea arriving a quarter of a century earlier in 1973 when an intermediate league and championship double was plucked. Outside the adult team, Peter also collected two county U21 championships and a Fermanagh minor league memento. During the ’80s, Roslea really came to the fore and senior championship successes were recorded in 1982, ’84 and ’86. Peter also played in the county finals of ’83, ’87 and ’89 and was on the Roslea side that clinched six successive senior league titles. Nineteen-eighty-four stood out as a landmark year, as the Shamrocks marked the Association’s 100th birthday in fine style. Meanwhile, with Fermanagh, Peter won an Ulster minor league in 1970 and featured on the sides beaten by Derry and Tyrone respectively in the Ulster MFC finals of ’70 and ’71. In those same two years, however, the Erne County had more luck at under 21 level, collecting both Ulster titles en route to successive All-Ireland final appearances against mighty Cork. He played for the county at all levels in 1970, breaking onto the senior side for the national league in autumn. He played his last game for the county seniors in the national league against Laois in 1991, under PJ McGowan. By all accounts, that was something of an isolated appearance in the green jersey as McGinnity had missed a couple of years prior to then with knee and hip injuries. But he had been a regular with Fermanagh right through from 1970 until 1988/89. The highlight was 1982 when Fermanagh got to the Ulster final for the first time since 1945. They came closer than they’ve ever done to winning the Anglo-Celt Cup too, losing to Armagh by a mere three points, 0-10 to 1-4. Peter had a 100% record in Antrim club football. In three seasons with St John’s, he scooped three county senior league and championship doubles. In the 1977/78 Ulster club final, the Belfast outfit defeated Cavan Gaels by 2-10 to 2-2 at Castleblayney. At Corrigan Park in Belfast, they subsequently accounted for Kingdom (London) and Summerhill (Meath) in All-Ireland club quarter-final and semi-final meetings, winning those matches by ten and 13 points respectively. The All-Ireland final took place in Croke Park on 26 March 1978 and St John’s were overpowered by a Thomond College, Limerick combination including Pat Spillane and Brian Talty in their ranks. Peter and his St John’s teammates returned to the provincial club final stage in December of that same year but this time lost out to Monaghan champions Scotstown. The former Roslea/St John’s/Fermanagh/Ulster midfielder/half forward also had a lengthy schools, colleges and university career. He starred for St Michael’s, lining out in two McRory finals in ’69 and ’70 and was also on the only Michaels team to garner the Ranafast Cup, in 1970. He won a Ryan Cup and a couple of Trench Cups with St Mary’s Belfast and was midfield on the Queens side that faced UCD in the 1975 Sigerson final, marking John O’Keeffe that particular day. Peter also had the distinction of representing the Combined Colleges team. On qualifying as a PE instructor in 1976, Peter taught in Belfast for three years before returning to his own alma mater of St Michael’s, where he has remained since. He began his coaching career with the Michaels and also coached Roslea at different times in the eighties. He was player-manager of Fermanagh in 1986-87 and also managed Tyrone club Killyclogher - who were intermediate at the time - in the early-to-mid nineties. During that time, he took some coaching sessions with the Tyrone team that won back-to-back Ulster championships in 1995-96. After managing Leitrim for a while, he returned to Killyclogher (who had since gone senior) and led them to the 1999 Tyrone Senior Football Championship final against Carrickmore before eventually winning a Senior League title and the coveted Tyrone Senior Football Championship in 2003 - defeating Errigal Ciaran in the final.

He was part of the teams which won the gold medals in the football tournaments in 1908 and 1912. The team was identical to the England national amateur football team, and opinion is divided as to whether it should be referred to as a Great Britain team. In the 1908 tournament he played alongside Kenneth Hunt, who had been his teammate in the 1907 Varsity football match. He also played for Liverpool, Fulham, Everton, Wrexham, Northern Nomads and Oxford City. He played for England's amateur team in 24 matches between 1908 and 1913. Berry ended his playing career in October 1914 when he became a barrister. He later served as chairman and director at Liverpool F.C.

Designed by Celestino Rosatelli, it represented an intermediate step from the early biplane CR.1 and the later, successful series CR.30, CR.32 and CR.42. Design and development For the new aircraft, Rosatelli used a traditional sesquiplane configuration. The engine was a water-cooled Fiat A.20 V-12 engine. Major variants were the CR.20 Idro, a pontoon floatplane, and the CR.20 Asso, using a more powerful (336 kW/450 hp) Isotta Fraschini engine. CR.20bis, produced from 1930, differed from the original version only with the addition of a more advanced landing gear. At its peak in 1933, the CR.20 equipped 27 squadrons of the Italian Regia Aeronautica. The aircraft was used against Libyan rebels and in the early stages of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in the attack role.Taylor 1981, pp. 54–55. The CR.20s remained in service with the Regia Aeronautica in the aerobatics and training until the 1930s. In 1933, Italy sold five CR.20s to Paraguay, which was fighting the Chaco War against Bolivia, these serving as Paraguay's only fighters through to the end of the war.von Rauch 1976, pp. 210–211.

(Polonium is excluded as little is known about its compounds with indium). The best-characterised compounds are the In(III) and In(II) chalcogenides e.g. the sulfides In2S3 and InS. This group of compounds has attracted a lot of research attention because they include semiconductors, photovoltaics and phase-change materials. In many applications indium chalcogenides are used as the basis of ternary and quaternary compounds such as indium tin oxide, ITO and copper indium gallium selenide, CIGS. Some compounds that were reported and have found their way into text books have not been substantiated by later researchers. The list of compounds below shows compounds that have been reported, and those compounds that have not had their structure determined, or whose existence has not been confirmed by the latest structural investigations, are in italics. {  - ! oxide ! sulfide ! selenide ! telluride - In2O  In2Se  -  In4S3 In4Se3 In4Te3 -   In5S4   -   InS  InSe  InTe -   In6S7  In6Se7  -   In3S4   In3Te4 -    In7Te10 - In2O3 In2S3 In2Se3 In2Te3 -    In3Te5 -     In2Te5 - } There are a lot of compounds, the reason for this being that indium can be present as *In3+, oxidation state +3 *In+, oxidation state +1 *In24+ units, oxidation state of +2, also found in some indium halides, e.g. In2Br3. *non linear In35+ units isoelectronic with Hg32+. The compound In2Te5 is a polytelluride containing the Te32− unit. None of the indium chalcogenides can be described simply as ionic in nature, they all involve a degree of covalent bonding. However, in spite of this it is useful to formulate the compounds in ionic terms to get an insight into how the structures are built up. Compounds almost invariably have multiple polymorphs, that is they can crystallise in slightly different forms depending on either the method of production, or the substrate upon which they are deposited. Many of the compounds are made up of layers, and it is the different ways that the layers are stacked that is a cause of polymorphism. In2O, In2Se :In2O is well documented. It exists in the gaseous phase and there are numerous reports of small amounts detected in the solid phase but no definitive structure has been published. It is now believed that the compound described as In2Se was actually a sample of In4Se3. In4S3, In4Se3, In4Te3 :In4S3 had been reported but has more recently been re-investigated and is now believed not to exist. Both In4Se3 and In4Te3 are similar black crystalline solids and have been formulated to contain a non linear In35+ unit that is isoelectronic with Hg32+. For example the selenide is formulated as In+ In35+ 3Se2−. In5S4 :A reinvestigation showed that the original sample was actually SnIn4S4. InS, InSe, InTe ;InS, InSe :InS and InSe are similar, both contain In24+ and have a layer structure. InS for instance can be formulated In24+ 2S2−. InSe has two crystal forms β-InSe and γ-InSe that differ only in the way that the layers are stacked. InSe is a semiconductor and a phase change material and has potential as an optical recording medium. ;InTe :InTe in contrast to InS and InSe is a mixed valence indium compound containing In+ and In3+ and can be formulated as In+ In3+ 2Te2−. It is similar to TlSe and has tetrahedral InTe4 units that share edges. It has potential for use in photovoltaic devices. In6S7, In6Se7 :These compounds are isostructural, and have been formulated with indium in 3 different oxidation states, +1, +2 and +3. They have been formulated as e.g. In+ In24+ 3In3+ 7S2−. The indium – indium bond length in the In2 units are 2.741 A (sulfide), 2.760 (selenide). In6S7 is an n-type semiconductor. In3Te4 :This compound has been reported as a superconductor. An unusual structure has been proposed that is effectively In4Te4 but with one quarter of the indium positions vacant. There seems to be no short indium-indium distance that would indicate an In-In unit. In7Te10 :This is formulated as In24+ 12In3+ 20Te2−. The In- In distance is 276.3pm. It has a similar structure to Ga7Te10 and Al7Te10 In2S3, In2Se3, In2Te3 ;In2S3 :Indium(III) sulfide is a yellow or red high melting solid. It is an n-type semiconductor. ;In2Se3 :Indium(III) selenide is a black compound with potential optical applications. ;In2Te3 :Indium(III) telluride is a black high melting solid with applications as a semiconductor and in optical material. It has two crystalline forms, α- and β-. In3Te5 :This was reported in phase studies in 1964 but its structure has not been confirmed. In2Te5 :This is a polytelluride compound and the structure is made up of layers that in turn are made up of chains of linked InTe4 tetrahedra where three of the Te atoms are bridging. There are Te atoms separate from the chains. The compound has been formulated as (2In3+ Te2−Te32−)n counterbalanced with separate Te2− ions. The structure is similar to Al2Te5.

History In 1087, En no Gyōja established this area as a center for promoting Buddhism. Hōfuku-ji, as it was originally called, was built with the contributions of a devotee known as Hōfuku-Chōja who lived in the vicinity. In 1132, the ex-Emperor Toba donated this temple, with nearby manors, to the famous high priest Kogyo- Daishi; this new estate was called Ichijō-zan Daidenpon Negoro-ji. Kōgyō- Daishi, widely renowned as the restorer of the Shingon sect of Buddhism, moved here with his pupils, from Mount Kōya. After settling at Negoro-ji, Kōgyō- Daishi laid out his far-sighted plans and initiated the construction of the Enmyō-ji and Jingū-ji in the Negoro-ji temple grounds. Even after his death, in 1143, the Negoro-ji complex was influential and prosperous as the head seminary for Shingi sect of Shingon Buddhism for approximately 200 years. During the height of its influence in the late Muromachi period, about 2700 temples stood on the mountainside in the spacious grounds of Negoro-ji. In 1585, buildings (except the main pagoda and a few others) were burnt down during the Siege of Negoro-ji by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He feared the growing military power of the priesthood and the Negoro-gumi (warrior monks of the temple) who were skilled in the use of firearms. In 1623, the head of the Kii branch of the Tokugawa feudal clan, Tokugawa Yorinobu, initiated the reconstruction of the temple grounds. Through re-buildings over many decades during the Edo period, the Negoro-ji was completely transformed.

Its many common names include black-jack, beggarticks, farmer’s friends and Spanish needle, but most commonly referred to as cobblers pegs. It is native to the Americas but is widely distributed as an introduced species in other regions worldwide including Eurasia, Africa, Australia, South America and the Pacific Islands.Bidens pilosa. Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER). USFS. Description Bidens pilosa is a branched annual forb of gracile habit, growing up to 1.8 meters tall. It grows aggressively on disturbed land and often becomes weedy. The leaves are all oppositely arranged and range from simple to pinnate in form, the upper leaves with three to five dentate, ovate- to-lanceolate leaflets. The petioles are slightly winged.Flora of North America, Bidens pilosa Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 832. 1753. The plant may flower at any time of the year, but mainly in summer and autumn in temperate regions. The flowers are small heads borne on relatively long peduncles. The heads consist of about four or five broad white ray florets (ligules), surrounding many tubular yellow disc florets without ligules that develop into barbed fruits. The fruits are slightly curved, stiff, rough black rods, tetragonal in cross section, about 1 cm long, typically with two to three stiff, heavily barbed awns at their distal ends. Barbs on awn of Bidens pilosa The infructescences form stellate spherical burrs about one to two centimeters in diameter. The barbed spines of the achenes get stuck in the feathers, fur, fleeces, clothing, etc. of people or animals that brush against the plant. It is an effective means of seed dispersal by zoochory, as the fruits are transported by animals. This mechanism has helped the plant become a noxious weed in temperate and tropical regions. The barbed awns can injure flesh. Distribution The species is native to tropical America, widely naturalized throughout the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world. A weed of gardens, woodlands, and waste areas. Common names Its many English common names include black-jack, beggarticks, hairy beggarticks, cobbler's pegs, devil's needles, hairy bidens, Spanish needle, farmers friend, Devils Pitchfork, and sticky beaks.Atlas of Living Australia, Bidens pilosa L., Cobbler's Peg Uses Although Bidens pilosa is primarily considered a weed, in many parts of the world it is also a source of food and medicine.Grubben, G.

The leaves have a resinous flavor, and are eaten raw, in stews, or dried for storage. It is especially important in eastern Africa, where it is known as michicha. In Vietnam, during the Vietnam War, soldiers adopted the herb as a vegetable, which led to it being known as the \\"soldier vegetable\\". It is susceptible to hand weeding if small enough, even then must be bagged, and thick mulches may prevent it from growing. In traditional Chinese medicine, this plant is considered a medicinal herb, called xian feng cao ().. In traditional Bafumbira medicine, this plant is applied on a fresh wound and is known to be a medicinal herb, called inyabalasanya.Extracts from Bidens Pilosa are used in Southern Africa to cure malaria.

He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Louisiana-Monroe. He has also been a member of the St. Louis Rams and Carolina Panthers. Early years Payne's journey to stardom began back in Junction City, where he was a three-sport standout. His senior year was a breakout season tallying in over 1,700 yards, rushing with 26 touchdowns offensively, 104 tackles with 1 interception, and 1 fumble—both being returned for a touchdown. Though Payne's passion was football, he also played basketball admitted he never took basketball as seriously as he did football, he still averaged 18 points a game his senior year. According to Payne, his first love was baseball and was his primary sport until the 8th grade. Payne still had an outstanding senior year on the Diamond compiling a .463 batting average with 8 home runs. College career After graduating from high school, Payne headed a few miles south to the campus on the bayou, University Louisiana of Monroe. With ULM being the only Division 1 school that recruited Payne, he came in with a chip on his shoulder. Payne emerged into a high-performing playmaker his freshman year and was named “Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year” after rushing for 976 yards, 6 touchdowns, catching 41 passes for 488 yards and 3 touchdowns. Payne's sophomore year was plagued with multiple injuries—the worst causing him to miss the last 3 games of the season, enduring a broken arm, which would need surgery. Payne's would be faced with an ultimatum in his junior year, being asked to move to the defensive side of the ball to play the position of safety. Payne was an all-state linebacker in high school but never played the safety position, posing as a challenge for him. Payne admits the new task he was given was somewhat unsettling, but determining to live out his dream and become an NFL player no matter the cost, Payne stepped up to the challenge and emerged as the starting strong safety his junior year, as he posted 87 tackles with 7 pass deflections and made 2nd Team All Conference. As a senior, Payne became known as Mr. Handyman, as he was all over the field for the ULM Warhawks, making his senior year one of his most impressive and successful. Payne victoriously led the team with 98 tackles 4 interceptions, averaged 40.9 yards as the starting punter, and averaged 28 yards on the kickoff return. Payne earned 1st Team All Conference, 1st Team All Louisiana. Professional career Pre-draft Chicago Bears On April 29, 2007, the Chicago Bears made Payne their 5th pick in the NFL draft. By the 4th game of his rookie season Payne was called upon to be the starter, unfortunately, he suffered a season-ending injury in the 2nd quarter breaking his right arm for the 2nd time in his football career, which led to having surgery, and being placed on injured reserve. Payne came back for his 2nd season stronger than ever and was named the starting strong safety on opening day. In 2008, Payne won big on the field for the Bears. Payne had a very promising season starting all 16 games—the first 12 at strong safety and the final four at free safety emerging as a play maker for the Bears. In 2008 Payne led the Bears with four interceptions and finished with 88 tackles. Payne had a great season but would spend his entire off-season rehabilitating from surgery on a torn labrum he sustained in the last game of the year. Payne spent most of his 3rd year battling neck and back injuries and missing three games due to lacerated kidneys. In 2009, Payne played in 13 games and started 5. He finished with 46 tackles and five passes deflected. In the off-season, Payne would be traded to the St. Louis Rams. St. Louis Rams On April 28, 2010, Payne was traded to the St. Louis Rams. With the Rams Payne was having one of his best off- season as an NFL player; rotating with the 1st team defense and making plays, but was hit with a season-ending injury tearing his PCL in the last preseason game. Payne was placed on injured reserve then released a few days later. Carolina Panthers After rehabbing and missing all of the 2010 season, the Carolina Panthers would pick up Payne on July 29, 2011. After suffering a concussion in the first preseason game, Payne would miss the next 2 games. Payne was cleared and played the final preseason game, which would be his last game in the NFL. He was released on September 4.

He played internationally for the England amateur team, also gaining one full cap for the main England national team. He was a gold medal winner with Great Britain at the 1912 Summer Olympics. A. E. Knight, as he was always referred to in the press, attended the King Edward VI Grammar School and played for Surrey at the age of 17. He joined local club Godalming after leaving school. He began working for an insurance company and, through his job, moved to Portsmouth in 1908. Pompey snapped up the left back, and he spent a season in the reserves before making his first team debut in Southern League Division One. The First World War brought an end to competitive football. Knight was a member of the Territorial Army and volunteered for overseas service in 1914. He was initially sent with the 1/6th (Duke of Connaught's Own) Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment to India. This was followed by service in France, where he was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1916 and served with the Border Regiment. After hostilities ended, Knight captained the Pompey side that won the 1919–20 Southern League championship, and but for injury would have led the side in their first Football League fixture. He left Portsmouth in 1922, after a campaign that saw Portsmouth finish third in the Third Division South. He played out the remainder of his football career with the Corinthians amateur club, who granted him life membership. He was posthumously inducted into the Pompey Hall of Fame in 2015. Knight earned 30 amateur international caps. He played all three matches for the gold medal winning England amateur team in the 1912 Summer Olympics and also played for England in the 1920 Summer Olympics. He gained one full England cap, captaining the side against Ireland in a British Home Championship game on 25 October 1919 at Windsor Park, Belfast. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. He had also captained England in a Victory International match against Wales on 11 October 1919. Knight also played county cricket for Hampshire, playing four first-class games over a period of ten years.

He played college football at Cincinnati and was drafted by the Eagles in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played his entire 11 season career with the Eagles. Celek helped the Eagles win Super Bowl LII over the New England Patriots during the 2017 season; he subsequently retired that offseason. Early years Celek played high school football at La Salle High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was named first-team all-district as both a junior and senior. He set a school record after catching a pass for 89 yards. He also lettered in track two years in the shot put and discus. College career Celek played college football for the Cincinnati Bearcats, the first year under head coach Rick Minter and the following three seasons under Mark Dantonio. He won the UC Claude Rost Award (Most Valuable Player) and was a second-team All-Big East Conference selection. His four-year totals were 91 receptions for 1,135 yards (a 12.5 average) and 14 touchdowns, with the Bearcats earning victories his senior year in the International Bowl and his sophomore season in the Fort Worth Bowl. Professional career Celek (#87) in a game against the Washington Redskins on October 16, 2011 2007 season After not having been invited to the 2007 NFL Scouting Combine, Celek was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round (162nd overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. He signed a four- year contract with the team on May 30, 2007. 2008 season In 2008, Celek set franchise records for yards in a game with 131 in week 9 and receptions in a playoff game with 10 in the 2009 NFC Championship game. He caught two touchdowns in a game against the Arizona Cardinals, and his 19 catches during the 2008-09 NFL playoffs were the third most in NFL history for a tight end.http://media.philadelphiaeagles.com/media/150104/celek-brent.pdf 2009 season Celek became the starting tight end for the Eagles after L. J. Smith departed via free agency to the Baltimore Ravens in 2009.Smith, Ravens agree to deal-ESPN Retrieved July 11, 2012. After scoring a touchdown in a week 9 game at home against the Dallas Cowboys, Celek was penalized for excessive celebration after teammate Jason Avant lifted his leg in order to impersonate the mascot for Captain Morgan rum. After the incident, the NFL quickly banned what turned out to be a covert ad campaign allegedly put on by the company, whereas any NFL player that is caught striking the \\"Captain Morgan\\" pose on camera during a regular-season game would result in a donation of $10,000 to the Gridiron Greats, a non-profit which helps retired NFL players with various hardships after leaving the game. The league chose not to penalize Celek, but stated that any future incident would be punished. Celek signed six-year contract extension on December 1, 2009, to keep him under contract as an Eagle until after the 2016 season. On December 27, 2009, in week 16 against the Denver Broncos, Celek made four catches for 121 yards and a touchdown, his third 100-yard game of the season. His 47-yard touchdown catch was the longest of his career. After having a breakout year with 76 catches (a team high), 971 yards and eight touchdowns, Celek was named to the 2009 USA Today All-Joe Team. 2010 season In the 2010 season, Celek caught 42 passes for 511 yards and 4 touchdowns, including a then career-long 65-yard touchdown against the New York Giants in week 15, in the Miracle at the New Meadowlands. 2011 season Celek ended the season with 811 receiving yards, as quarterback Michael Vick's favorite target. He was one of three Eagle offensive players to start all 16 games, along with right tackle Todd Herremans and rookie center Jason Kelce. During the offseason, Celek was a passenger in a DUI car accident, where no one was hurt. 2012 season Celek finished the season with 57 receptions for 684 yards and one touchdown. 2013 season There was much anticipation going into the season due to the Eagles' hiring of Chip Kelly to replace longtime head coach Andy Reid. Celek finished the regular season with 32 receptions for 502 yards and six touchdowns after scoring a touchdown in each of the final two weeks. In the opening-round playoff loss to the New Orleans Saints, Celek caught two passes on three targets for 16 yards. 2014 season Going into the 2014 season, his eighth in the NFL, Celek stood second in Eagles team history in three tight end categories—all behind career leader Pete Retzlaff—in receiving yards (4,050), receptions (322), and touchdowns (26). Despite being the team's starter, Celek only had 90 yards in the team's first eight games (three of those games had no receptions), being used mostly for blocking. When Nick Foles went down due to injury, Celek saw more catches from backup Mark Sanchez. This was best showcased in a win over the Carolina Panthers, in which he caught 5 passes for 116 yards. He also caught his lone touchdown of the season from Sanchez, a 1-yard catch against the Giants in Week 17. Celek finished the season with 32 receptions for 340 yards and 1 touchdown, which was less than half of teammate Zach Ertz's total. 2015 season Despite Ertz's receiving ability, Celek remained the Eagles #1 tight end due to his superior blocking ability. Similarly to 2014, Celek had an uneventful start, only getting one catch on one target for six yards in three games. However, in a Week 4 divisional matchup against the Redskins, he scored his first touchdown of the season on a 10-yard catch and run from new quarterback Sam Bradford. Celek followed it up with 3 catches for 44 yards and another touchdown against the Saints. Celek only caught 2 passes for 11 yards in a game against the Panthers, and against the Cowboys he caught no passes. Celek did, however, make a crucial block on Dallas' defensive end Greg Hardy in overtime that allowed Bradford to throw the game-winning touchdown. Celek exploded onto the scene with 4 catches for 134 yards in a week 10 matchup against the Miami Dolphins, followed by 7 catches for 79 yards against the Buccaneers, and 2 catches for 10 yards and a touchdown against the Lions. Mark Sanchez started 2 of these games, and played in all 3, although Bradford threw 3 of Celek's 4 catches against Miami. Despite having only 35 targets, 8th on the team, Celek finished the year with 27 catches for 398 yards (3rd on the team) and 3 touchdowns (T-2nd on the team). On January 26, 2016, Celek signed a three-year contract extension with the Eagles for $13 million, with $6 million guaranteed. Celek in Ocean City, New Jersey 2016 season He played in all 16 games with 8 starts, recording 14 receptions for 155 yards, but no touchdowns for the first time in his career. 2017 season Celek played in all 16 games and recorded career lows in catches and yards with 13 receptions for 130 yards, but did catch a touchdown. This was due to a larger role that Zach Ertz played in the tight end position, and Celek was relegated to back-up and would be rotated occasionally to keep Ertz rested. Celek earned his first championship ring when the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII by a score of 41-33; although he did not have any catches in the game, Celek did make a key block that allowed running back LeGarrette Blount to score a touchdown during the second quarter. On March 13, 2018, Celek was released by the Eagles.  Retirement  On August 31, 2018, Celek announced his retirement from the NFL. Post-playing career On February 7, 2020, Celek was hired as a personnel consultant in the Eagles' football operations department, alongside former teammate Darren Sproles. Personal life Celek is the son of Steve and Debbie Celek and the oldest of five children. Brent's younger brother, Garrett, played tight end at Michigan State under coach Mark Dantonio, who coached Brent when he played for Cincinnati. After going undrafted, Garrett signed with the San Francisco 49ers.

One controversy surrounding thw book is that Davies purposely anglicised most of the Polish proper names, including placenames and pseudonyms used by Polish conspirators, to bring the reality of events closer to English-speaking readers and to help them concentrate on the narrative, rather than on the complexity of Polish names. However, the Polish historian Jan Ciechanowski has taken grave exception to the work in more general terms: :In the hands of Davies the Warsaw Rising has become his personal \\"plaything\\", the outpouring of his uncommonly overactive imagination, his huge arrogance and of his vast fantasy.

It acts as a competitive antagonist, and can therefore be an antidote to the acute impairment caused by alcohols, including ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butyl alcohol, tert-amyl alcohol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, methylpentynol and ethchlorvynol. Ro15-4513 is structurally related to the benzodiazepine antidote flumazenil. Uses Original development as alcohol antidote The main interest in Ro15-4513 was as an antidote to alcohol. Flumazenil effectively blocks the effects of benzodiazepine agonists such as alprazolam and diazepam and so is used for treating overdoses of these drugs but is ineffective in blocking alcohol actions. Ro15-4513 was somewhat less effective than flumazenil at blocking the effects of benzodiazepines, but instead selectively blocked the effects of ethanol. This meant that in contrast to flumazenil, which is ineffective at treating alcohol overdoses, Ro15-4513 showed potential as a useful alcohol antidote. It is thought that Ro15-4513 antagonizes the effects of ethanol because the azido group at the 8- position of the benzene ring blocks the binding site for ethanol on the α5β3δ subtype of the GABAA receptor; flumazenil, which has a fluorine at this position, does not block this binding site and so does not counteract the effects of ethanol. Unfortunately Ro15-4513 had several disadvantages that made it unsuitable for development and marketing. Its fairly short half-life means that several repeated doses would have to be given over an extended period, since if only one dose were used it would wear off before the alcohol had been metabolised and the patient would relapse (similar to the problems with renarcotization seen when treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone with short-acting antagonists such as naloxone). Also because of its GABA antagonist effects, Ro15-4513 causes serious side-effects including both anxiety, and at higher doses, convulsions, which would require careful control of dosing and would cause complications in clinical use. Another problem is that alcohol's effects are not purely mediated by GABA receptors; at higher doses alcohol binds to several other targets as well, so while Ro15-4513 is an effective antidote against moderate levels of alcohol intoxication, it might be ineffective at treating life-threatening overdoses. Also, Roche was concerned about the legal implications of introducing an alcohol antidote, as Ro15-4513 blocks the effects of ethanol but does not remove it from the bloodstream, which could lead to potential problems, as the effects of the alcohol would be masked only temporarily. As a result, patients might, for instance, feel that they are sober and discharge themselves from hospital once the drug took effect, then become drunk again once it wore off, possibly crashing their car or having other accidents that might lead to legal consequences for Roche. However, the discovery of Ro15-4513 has been important in elucidating the mechanism of action of ethanol as used as a recreational drug, and this compound could now be used as a template to design a more effective and longer-lasting antidote for ethanol, or alternatively to develop a selective agonist drug that could replicate the desired effects of alcohol, but with fewer side effects. Current use in PET Imaging Labelling Ro15-4513 with carbon-11 leads to the possibility of its use in PET imaging of the brain. The specificity of the compound to a small number of GABA receptor sub-types leads to the generation, with accurate modelling, of detailed images with well-defined limbic and cortical structures. These images can be useful in quantitatively analysing conditions such as addiction, that are known to be, at least in part, associated with the GABAergic system. The images produced are similar to those for labelled flumazenil, though the distribution varies especially in regions such as the occipital lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, as it does not selectively label the GABRA1 subtype.

Law in the British Virgin Islands tends to be a combination of the very old and the very new. As a leading offshore financial centre, the territory has extremely modern statutes dealing with company law, insolvency, banking law, trust law, insurance and other related matters. However, in a number of areas of law, such as family law, the laws of the British Virgin Islands are based upon very old English laws, and can cause some difficulty in modern times. Other areas of law, such as international law, are essentially regulated externally through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London by Order in Council. A large body of the laws of the British Virgin Islands consists of the common law, which continually updates itself through judicial precedent in the territory and in other common law countries. The British Virgin Islands is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom. Although the local legislature and courts are independent from the United Kingdom, the British government deals with most international relations on behalf of the territory, although authority has been delegated to the territory to negotiate on its own behalf in certain areas (see below under Constitutional law). The British Virgin Islands does not have a separate vote at the United Nations. Legal history The Virgin Islands Supreme Court The early legal history of the British Virgin Islands is somewhat hampered by the fact that in the days of colonisation, it was often unclear who controlled the islands. The islands were first settled in modern times by the Dutch, but in 1628 the English crown granted patents for the settlement of what is now the British Virgin Islands to Lord Willoughby. The British expelled the Dutch in 1672 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but later evinced an intention to return the islands to the Dutch. They later resiled from this position and in 1698 the British government took the view that the territory was a British possession (see generally: History of the British Virgin Islands). It was not until 1773 that the British Virgin Islands actually had its own legislature. Prior to that date laws were extended to the territory by the legislature of the Leeward Islands in Antigua. Some of these laws are still in force in the British Virgin Islands, such as the Common Law (Declaration of Application) Act (Cap 13), which dates from 1705. Doubts as to the validity of those statutes were removed by the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. The Legislative Assembly first sat on 27 January 1774, however, it took a full further decade for a constitutional framework to be settled. Part of the problem was that the islands were so thinly populated, it was almost impossible to constitute the organs of government. In 1776 George Suckling was appointed as Chief Justice, although he did not arrive until 1778, due to political maneuvering in the territory. Having arrived, the legislature eventually got rid of Suckling by declining to pass the Court Bill. The first law ever to be passed by a local legislature in the British Virgin Islands concerned punishments for runaway slaves. The second provided a mechanism for settling longstanding boundary disputes. Both no doubt reflected the concerns of the islands free inhabitants. But the Governor-General refused to assent to any bills until a Court Bill was passed. Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly needed to be approved by the Governor-General in Antigua, and early legislation was often vetoed. Laws could also still be passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Leeward Islands under a quasi-federal system, and these applied to all of the British territories in the Leeward Islands.An example being the Amelioration Act, 1798 However, the Governor-General used this veto force the Virgin Islands to pass legislation establishing a court. Eventually the Court Bill was passed in 1783 together with a Bill validating titles as a form of compromise.Many of the local residents were heavily indebted, and feared that a court would allow their creditors direct recourse. Nonetheless, it took some time to obtain a Chief Justice whose appointment could be confirmed. In 1867 the territory obtained its first ever written constitution in the form of the Constitution Ordinance, which abolished the previous legislative assembly and provided for a new legislative council. However, abolition of slavery and a collapse in sugar prices in the 19th century lead to the virtual economic ruin of the islands, and although the legislature limped along for some time, it was eventually formally dissolved in 1901. After the famous march of 1947 the legislature was restored in 1950, and permanent self-government was devolved in 1967. The main purpose of the 1950 Constitution was to re-devolve power back to the reformed Legislative Council in the British Virgin Islands from the Governor of the Leeward Islands. Historically it is regarded a holding measure; a part of the process that eventually led to the more fundamental constitutional government in 1967.Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order, 1967 (SI No 471 of 1967). The British Government had hoped that after the Leeward Islands Federation was abolished in 1956 the British Virgin Islands would join the new Federation of the West Indies, but there was little enthusiasm for that, and so eventually the 1967 Constitution was promulgated. The 1967 Constitution was eventually replaced by a revised and updated Constitution in 1976,Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order, 1976 (SI No 2145 of 1976). and the 1976 Constitution was amended at various points, and then in turn superseded in 2007 by the current form. Arthur Hodge In international terms, probably the most significant event which occurred in the territory's legal history was the trial and execution of Arthur William Hodge for the murder of a slave; the only time a British subject was ever executed for killing a slave. Sources of law Common law and equity Principles of English common law and equity are extended to the British Virgin Islands by statute. The Common Law (Declaration of Application) Act (Cap 13) provides: The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (Virgin Islands) Act (Cap 80) provides: Legislation Revised Laws of the Virgin Islands, 1991 Local statutes are passed by the House of Assembly in the British Virgin Islands. Statutes are subject to Royal Assent by the Governor as the Queen's representative in the territory, but a refusal to grant Royal Assent has never yet occurred in the jurisdiction during the modern era. Periodically, the statutes of the British Virgin Islands are consolidated and issued as the Revised Laws of the Virgin Islands. This was most recently done in 1991. In such revisions, all laws are given a specific chapter number (usually abbreviated to \\"Cap.\\"). Hence the Limitation Act is usually cited as the Limitation Act (Cap 43). Legislation passed after 1991 is usually referred to by year, so the Merchant Shipping Act is usually referred to as the Merchant Shipping Act, 2001, but may be referred to in long form as the Merchant Shipping Act (No 13 of 2001). On several occasions since 1991 there has been discussion of producing a new revised set of the laws of the Virgin Islands, and in 2014 legislation was passed to facilitate the process.Law Revision Act, 2014. Concerns have been expressed in relation to the statute as it also purports to confer direct power on the Attorney General to amend primary legislation, but under article 79 of the Constitution this power is reserved to the House of Assembly and requires the assent of the Governor. Orders in Council Orders in Council are a form of promulgated legislation issued by the British Government. Usually they deal with routine matters which it would be impractical to burden the local legislature with, such as implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions into law. Various other highly technical aspects of legislation are dealt with by way of Order in Council; for example, all of the jurisdiction's laws relating to civil aviation are promulgated in this manner. However, orders-in-council are also sometimes used by the United Kingdom government to push through measures which are unpopular locally, and would be difficult to pass using the normal democratic process. Recent examples of this include the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1991, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 2000.Caribbean Territories (Criminal Law) Order, 2000. Media comment on the development was mixed. Specific legal subjects Commercial law Commercial law is given major emphasis by the territory's legislative process. Generally speaking, commercial law , including insolvency law, is relatively well developed in the British Virgin Islands. New legislation has been introduced to try to foster e-commerce in the jurisdiction.Such as the Electronic Transactions Act, 2001 Other legislation is slightly variable; legislation relating to arbitration and bills of exchange date from the nineteenth century, but still operate effectively. Some legislation needs updating. The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 220) dates from 1961, and still contains provisions clarifying when a wife may hold property in her own name. =Competition law= In the British Virgin Islands, there is almost no competition law to speak of. In fact, the position is actually the reverse. A number of specific statutory monopolies are protected and preserved by legislation in the territory,For example, the British Virgin Islands Electricity Corporation Act (Cap 277) confers a statutory monopoly on the generation of electricity; the Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited Telephones Act (Cap 168) (now partially repealed) conferred a statutory monopoly on telecommunications. and in other areas, new entrants to the markets are carefully scrutinised, and may be barred from entering where they might provide competition for local businesses.A licence to operate any kind of business is required under the Business, Professions and Trade Licences Act (Cap 200), although exceptions apply for trust companies, licensed banks and other financial services. =Company law= The British Virgin Islands has one of the most sophisticated company law codes in the world. Up until 1984 all incorporations in the British Virgin Islands were made under the Companies Act (Cap 285), which was originally passed in 1885. In 1984, the territory incorporated the International Business Companies Act, which provided a sophisticated and updated legal structure in which to incorporate international business companies, and was widely copied by other tax havens. In 2004, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 was incorporated, and for a year it was possible to incorporate a company under any of the three acts. However, from 1 January 2006 it was no longer possible to incorporate under the International Business Companies Act (which was subsequently repealed), and from 1 January 2008 it will no longer be possible to incorporate under the Companies Act, leaving the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 as the sole corporate statute. The BVI Business Companies Act is based largely on New Zealand company law, but has been modified to include many of the characteristic features of offshore financial centres (such as removing restrictions on financial assistance and thin capitalisation, and permitting distribution in specie). It has also adopted some slightly novel and radical steps, such as abolishing the concept of share capital and rules relating to share premium. Some of these developments were a little advanced even for the offshore market, and have taken some time to bed down. The Act has now been copied wholesale by the Isle of Man, and it remains to be seen if the act becomes as widely copied as the old International Business Companies Act. It is also possible to form limited liability partnerships in the British Virgin Islands under the Partnership Act, 1996. =Insolvency law= The law relating to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is regulated by the Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards in relation to the jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. The Insolvency Act is \\"predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights\\". The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate set-off upon a credit event in derivatives transactions. It also contains specific \\"safe harbour\\" provisions relating to vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and voidable floating charges) on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions. =Financial services= A substantial body of British Virgin Islands law is dedicated to the regulation of what are collectively referred to as financial services. This broadly means offshore business which requires specific regulation. The key statutes dealing with financial services are: * Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 * Banks and Trust Companies Act, 1990 * Insurance Act, 2008 * Company Management Act, 1990 * Financing and Money Services Act, 2009 Financial services in the British Virgin Islands are regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (usually abbreviated to FSC). =Tax law= The British Virgin Islands has almost no taxation. Although there is technically income tax in the British Virgin Islands, the effective rate is zero. There is no capital gains tax, gift tax, sales tax, value added tax or inheritance tax. The only real tax burdens imposed in the jurisdiction are: * Payroll tax on employees within the territory.Payroll Taxes Act, 2004 * Stamp duty, which usually only applies to transfers of land, and transfers of shares in companies which own land.Stamp Act (Cap 202). Stamp duty actually operates in relation to most transactions in the Territory, but then it is excluded where the document relates to or is entered into by a company, except for in the situations mentioned. Contracts entered into between individuals may still be subject to stamp duty in the usual way if the document is brought into the Territory. * Customs import duty. * Land tax and house tax.Land and House Tax Act (Cap 207) * Various minor ancillary taxes and permit fees.For example, all cheques drawn on a bank within the Territory must be assessed with 10¢ cheque duty; cruise ship are subject to a passenger tax; passengers flying in and out of the Territory are subject to an airport tax. The British Virgin Islands generally appears on most lists of recognised tax havens. Constitutional law The British Virgin Islands is currently organised under its fourth constitution, promulgated in 2007,The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007 (Statutory Instrument 2007 No. 1678) which represents a sizeable turnover given that the first was only obtained in 1950. The most recent constitution came into effect fully after the 2007 general election. By 2010 the Premier at the time, Ralph O'Neal, had already called for a further constitutional review. The British Virgin Islands constitution focuses heavily on a distinct cultural identity, contains commitments to uphold human rights and the rule of law, and professes a national belief in God. Despite the strong professed protection of human rights and equal treatment, the constitution expressly preserves the right to discriminate against non-belongers in relation to taxation and employment. The constitution also calls for the formation of a number of committees to promote the constitutional development on the territory, most of which have never been formed.Chapter 7 provides for, amongst others, a public service commission, a teaching service commission, a judicial and legal services commission, and a police service commission. Elsewhere the constitution provides for a human rights commission (section 34) and an advisory committee for the prerogative of mercy. Pursuant to a \\"letter of entrustment\\" dated 13 June 2007 the British government has devolved wide discretion to the government of the territory to manage its own external affairs, and adds that the British government would give \\"sympathetic consideration\\" for requests to take action on other matters. Contract law British Virgin Islands contract law is almost entirely based upon English common law. The British Virgin Islands has no equivalent of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, and applies strict privity of contract. Similarly there is no equivalent to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 in the territory. Criminal law In 1997, almost all of the criminal law of the territory was consolidated into a single piece of legislation, the Criminal Code, 1997. Although it was generally regarded as desirable to consolidate all of the criminal laws into a single source, some criticisms have been made at the \\"warts and all\\" approach taken to common law offences. For example, in relation to the law of rape, the code provides that a man cannot be guilty of raping his wife, even though this has not been the rule at common law since 1991.R v. R [1992] 1 AC 599 Generally speaking, most serious criminal offences in the jurisdiction are dealt with under the same principles as the original English common law, and specific English Victorian statutes (such as the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861). The death penalty was abolished for murder in 1991 (controversially), and was subsequently also removed for the last remaining offences (piracy and treason) in 2001. Family law In international terms family law is relatively underdeveloped in the British Virgin Islands. Levels of maintenance payments are fixed by out of date statutory provisions which mean that levels of support after divorce or separation are derisorily low. Unmarried fathers have relatively little statutory protection in relation to paternal rights. Illegitimate children have no right to inherit upon an intestacy. Property law Property law in the British Virgin Islands has only ever undergone spasmodic and periodic reform.\\"Whilst the British Virgin Islands legislature has taken every effort to maintain modern and commercially efficient laws relating to companies, financial services and insolvency, unfortunately the same cannot be said with respect to the treatment of the law of property.\\" The principle legislation dealing with property rights is the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 220), which is based on much earlier English legislation. Tacit recognition that this legislation needs updating is found in the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, which (to assist structured finance transactions) provides that in relation to a security interest over shares in a British Virgin Islands company, the parties may completely exclude the effect of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act. In relation to real estate, the British Virgin Islands adopted a Torrens registration system in the early 1970s, which considerably simplified domestic conveyancing. The Cadastral survey of the islands was completed in 1972, and the new system was almost fully implemented by 1974. Non-residents wishing to purchase property in the British Virgin Islands must obtain a Non-Belongers Land Holding License. Tort British Virgin Islands tort law is largely based upon English common law. Trusts and equity The British Virgin Islands law relating to trusts and equity is derived directly from English law, but has been modified by legislation to reflect the position of the territory as an offshore financial centre. The usual features for offshore trusts are all empowered by statute in the territory - non-charitable purpose trusts, extended perpetuity periods, abrogation of the rule in Bartlett v Barclays Bank and widened investment powers. The leading Privy Council decision on \\"imperfect gifts\\" in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani [2001] 2 All ER 492 was an appeal from the British Virgin Islands courts. Other legal disciplines *Arbitration - Arbitration in the British Virgin Islands is regulated by the Arbitration Act, 2013. *Labour law - the British Virgin Islands labour law has been entirely designed around protecting the local workforce from outside competition. Any person who does not have belonger status requires either a work permit or an exemption; local employers are prohibited from employing foreigners where there is a suitably qualified local person. Labour law in the territory is codified into a single statute, the Labour Code, 2010. *Immigration law - similarly, the British Virgin Islands takes an extremely restrictive position in relation to immigration. Even birth in the country is not sufficient to grant belongers status (unless the person is born to parents who are themselves belongers). It is possible to be naturalised after a period of long residence, but it is rare to be naturalised after less than 25 years, and often much longer. The British Virgin Islands government has announced as policy that it will only naturalise 25 new belongers each year. Laws in the British Virgin Islands openly discriminate against non-belongers. For example, stamp duty on the purchase of land is 4% for belongers and 12% for non-belongers. *Investigatory laws - because of its position as an offshore financial centre, the British Virgin Islands has regulatory responsibilities which are out of all proportion with its size or economy. The result has been a raft of legislation designed to investigate and curb unlawful tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. The unfortunate result of this is a patchwork quilt of rules of regulations that are extremely complex to follow, even for experienced practitioners and judges. Some of the laws reflect bilateral agreements with specific countries,Such as the Mutual Legal Assistance (United States of America) Act, 1990 some relate to specific times of crime,Such as the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1992 and some have generic application.Such as the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act, 1997 and the general power of the court to grant Anton Piller orders. Unfortunately a raft of conflicting international agreements, initiatives and treaties with conflicting standards and aims, any kind of rationalisation or consolidation seems wholly improbable. Human rights In practice, basic human rights are broadly respected in the British Virgin Islands. Repression of freedom of speech, interference with democracy or the rule of law, and arbitrary arrest and torture are virtually unknown. The territory has been described as “generally free of human rights abuses” and its government has been characterised as taking “a strong and proactive approach to the protection of human rights.” However, the laws in the British Virgin Islands do openly discriminate against people who do not hold what is called “belonger status.” This form of discrimination is expressly preserved in the BVI constitution, which excludes non-belongers from the full scope of its non-discrimination protections. Legal institutions Executive Under the British Virgin Islands constitution, executive power is vested in the Monarch, and exercised through the Governor. The constitution also provides for the composition of the Cabinet (referred to under former constitutions as the Executive Council, often still abbreviated locally to \\"ExCo\\").Article 47 of the Constitution. This consists of the Premier, the Attorney General and four other ministers. The Governor normally attends and presides over meetings of the Cabinet.Article 49 of the Constitution. The constitution reserves certain key functions to the Governor,Article 60 of the Constitution. including: #external affairs, subject to certain specifically excluded matters; #defence, including the armed forces; #internal security, including the Police Force; #the terms and conditions of service of persons holding or acting in public offices; and #the administration of the courts. The Governor retains a prerogative power of pardon, and certain other specific prerogative powers under the constitution.Article 43 of the Constitution. Legislature The British Virgin Islands legislature consists of the House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands (known under previous constitutions as the Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands, often still abbreviated locally to \\"LegCo\\"), and is headed by the Monarch.Article 62 of the Constitution. The Legislative Council consists of 13 elected members; nine tied to electoral districts, and four \\"at large\\" seats. Belonger status is a requirement to be elected to the Legislative Council. Judiciary Low level disputes and petty crimes in the British Virgin Islands are resolved in the magistrates' court. More serious matters are dealt with in the high court. The British Virgin Islands is part of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court circuit. Unusually for its size, the British Virgin Islands has two permanent judges. The British Virgin Islands hosts the Commercial Court of the East Caribbean Supreme Court, which was opened on 9 April 2009. Justice Edward Bannister QC was sworn in, and after initially sitting in temporary accommodation, the new Commercial Court building was officially opened on 4 November 2009. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal. Final appeal lies to the Privy Council. Unusually, the British Virgin Islands is one of the relatively few jurisdictions in the region which is opposed to the Caribbean Court of Justice. The British Virgin Islands Bar Association has always expressed a strong disinclination to abandon a right of final appeal to the Privy Council. Legal profession The legal profession is regulated by the Virgin Islands General Legal Council, and the principle statute dealing with the profession is the Legal Profession Act 2015. However the legislation has been fraught with difficulties and has already been amended by three times. Further, key appointments under the legislation - including the appointment of a disciplinary tribunal, have still not been made. The legal profession in the British Virgin Islands is a fused profession. Most resident lawyers in the Territory are also members of the BVI Bar Association, although that is a voluntary association and does not of itself have any power to regulate. Law reform The British Virgin Islands has a dedicated Law Commission for the purposes of reviewing and revising the laws of the territory.

He played college football for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and earned consensus All- American honors. The Kansas City Chiefs selected him in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. Medlock has also played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts and Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL, as well as the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). Early years Medlock was born in Fremont, California. He attended Mission San Jose High School In Fremont, and played for the Mission San Jose Warriors high school football team as both a punter and placekicker. Medlock was ranked ninth in the country and was all- county and all-league at both positions. He averaged 43.1 yards per punt as a punter and made 11 out of 19 field goals in his junior and senior years. College career Medlock attended University of California, Los Angeles, where he played for the UCLA Bruins football team from 2003 to 2006. He set a UCLA career record with six field goals of fifty yards or more, and was a four-year letterman. Overall, he completed 70 field goals on 80 attempts, and 147 of 148 extra point attempts. As a senior in 2006, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. Professional career Kansas City Chiefs Medlock was drafted in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs with the 160th overall pick. Medlock was thought to go into the preseason competing with Lawrence Tynes for the kicking job, but the Chiefs traded Tynes to the New York Giants, thus making Medlock the de facto starter. Medlock was inconsistent in the preseason, making 3 of 6 kicks; the Chiefs released Medlock on September 10, 2007, after he converted a 27-yard field goal and missed on a 30-yard attempt in Week 1 against the Houston Texans, and signed Dave Rayner as a replacement. St. Louis Rams On February 11, 2008, Medlock signed with the St. Louis Rams. The Rams allowed Medlock to seek a trade after the signing of Josh Brown.Footnotes He was later released on August 26, 2008. Toronto Argonauts Medlock with the Argonauts in 2009. Medlock signed with the Toronto Argonauts on April 16, 2009 and competed with fellow new import kicker Eddie Johnson for the kicking spot vacated by the retirement of Mike Vanderjagt. At the end of training camp, the Argos elected to keep both kickers and coach Bart Andrus elected to start Johnson for game one and placed Medlock on the practice roster. Johnson, however, was injured on the opening kickoff when he separated his shoulder when tackling the return man and Medlock was slated to kick for game two of the 2009 Toronto Argonauts season. On August 14, 2009, Medlock scored seven field goals, tying Lance Chomyc's Argonauts single-game team record and just short of the league record of eight shared by Dave Ridgway, Mark McLoughlin, and Paul Osbaldiston. Washington Redskins On February 12, 2010 the Washington Redskins signed Medlock to a future contract. He was waived on June 14, 2010.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Biography  Peter-Erich Cremer was born in Metz, Alsace-Lorraine, on 25 March 1911. After high school, Cremer enlisted in the Reichsmarine in 1932. After serving on cruisers and destroyers, Cremer became captain in February 1940. He received the Iron Cross 2nd class. He was promoted to the rank of submarine commander in August 1940, and was given the U-152. He commanded the from 25 August 1941 to 6 October 1942 and again from 18 May 1943, to 19 July 1944. On 31 January 1942 he mistakenly attacked and sunk the ; he was court-martialed and found not guilty. After several victorious trips, he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) on 5 June 1942, and in that same year was severely wounded. He sailed again from 1943 until July 1944, before giving his boat to his lieutenant. On November 1944, Cremer, now Lieutenant Commander, aimed to convey the new submarine U-2519 Class XXI. Citing \\"several design flaws\\", Cremer scuttled the submarine at Kiel, on May 1945. As the War drew to a close, he was attached to the personal security unit of Karl Dönitz. In this role he was involved in the incident in which Kapitän zur See Wolfgang Lüth was shot to death by a German sentry. Peter-Erich Cremer appeared in the British television documentary The World at War in the early 1970s. Later he recounted his life in his books U-333: The story of a u-boat ace and U-Boat Commander: a periscope view of the Battle of the Atlantic. He died in Hamburg on 5 July 1992.

Spo11, in a complex with mTopVIB, creates double strand breaks to initiate meiotic recombination. Its active site contains a tyrosine which ligates and dissociates with DNA to promote break formation. One Spo11 protein is involved per strand of DNA, thus two Spo11 proteins are involved in each double stranded break event. Genetic exchange between two DNA molecules by homologous recombination begins with a break in both strands of DNA—called a double- strand break—and recombination is started by an endonuclease enzyme that cuts the DNA molecule that \\"receives\\" the exchanged DNA. In meiosis the enzyme is SPO11, which is related to DNA topoisomerases. Topoisomerases change DNA by transiently breaking one or both strands, passing the unbroken DNA strand or strands through the break and repairing the break; the broken ends of the DNA are covalently linked to topoisomerase. SPO11 is similarly attached to the DNA when it forms double-strand breaks during meiosis.  Meiotic recombination  SPO11 is considered to play a predominant role in initiating meiotic recombination. However, recombination may also occur by alternative SPO11-independent mechanisms that can be studied experimentally using spo11 mutants. In the budding yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae, the meiotic defects in recombination and chromosome disjunction of spo11 mutants are alleviated by X-irradiation. This finding indicates that X-ray induced DNA damages can initiate crossover recombination leading to proper disjunction independently of SPO11. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a homolog of spo11 is ordinarily employed in the initiation of meiotic recombination. However, radiation induced-breaks can also initiate recombination in mutants deleted for this spo11 homolog. Deamination of cytosine resulting in the dU:dG mismatch is one of the most common single-base-altering lesions in non-replicating DNA. Spo11 mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and C. elegans undergo meiotic crossover recombination and proper chromosome segregation when dU:dG lesions are produced in their DNA. This crossover recombination does not involve the formation of large numbers of double-strand breaks, but does require uracil DNA-glycosylase, an enzyme that removes uracil from the DNA phosphodiester backbone and initiates base excision repair. Thus, it was proposed that base excision repair of DNA damage such as a uracil base, an abasic site, or a single-strand nick is sufficient to initiate meiotic crossover recombination in S. pombe and C. elegans. In S. pombe, a mutant defective in the spo11 homolog Rec12 is deficient in meiotic recombination. However recombination can be restored to near normal levels by a deletion in rad2, a gene that encodes an endonuclease involved in Okazaki fragment processing (Farah et al., 2005). Both crossover and non-crossover recombination were increased but double-strand breaks were undetectable. On the basis of the biochemical properties of the rad2 deletion, it was proposed that meiotic recombination can be initiated by DNA lesions other than double- strand breaks, such as nicks and gaps which accumulate during premeiotic DNA replication when Okasaki fragment processing is deficient. The above findings indicate that DNA damages arising from a variety of sources can be repaired by meiotic recombination and that such a process can occur independently of SPO11.  Absence in some sexual species  The most recent common ancestor of the social amoeba genera Dictyostelium, Polysphondylium and Acytostelium, appears to have lacked the Spo11 gene. Such an ancestor likely lived several hundred million years ago. Dictyostelium discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum are both capable of meiotic sexual reproduction (see 'D. discoideum sexual reproduction and 'P. pallidum sexual reproduction). Bloomfield speculated that dormant cells in the soil might be exposed to many kinds of stress, such as desiccation or radiation, that could induce spontaneous DNA damage. Such damage would make the induction of double-strand breaks by Spo11 redundant for the initiation of recombination during meiosis, and thus explain its absence in this group.

It reflects the culture and the tradition of Himachal. Hardly any festivity there is celebrated without dancing. Dance forms such as Nati are performed all over the region. Nati Nati is the most famous dance of Himachal Pradesh. It is listed in the Guinness world record book as the largest folk dance. It mainly originated from Kullu and Shimla district and became popular across the state and in Chandigarh where Himachali youth performed this on cultural programmes in colleges and universities. Nati is performed on important occasions such as marriages. ..  Mala (Garland)  The Kayang Mala dance another dance. Dancers dress in traditional finery, weave their arms together to form a sort of a crisscross pattern in order to appear like beads in a woven garland. They drink chhang (a rice brew) before this dance.  Demon (Rakshasa)  This dance from Kinnaur and nearby areas are redolent of the historic period. The Kinnaur folk are compared to deer. The dance is performed with demon masks. It represents the attack of the demons on the crops and their ritual pursuing away by the forces of good.General view up of dance forms in Himachal Chhambha is more or less similar to the Punjabi dance Bhangra. These dance forms are generally organised in areas having dense population. During their local festivals like Chaitol and Bishu, such community dancing can be witnessed. Men and women hold hands and dance together. Their leader is known as Ghure.  Dalshone and Cholamba  The Dalshone and Cholamba dance forms belong to the Ropa valley. The pattern formed by the dancers seems to resemble coiled serpents. Cholamba is generally performed when a tiger is killed. The dead animal's skin is stuffed and a gold ornament is put in his nose. The remains of the corpse is then rotated and people dance around it. Nagas Kayang is a dance form that copies the snake's movement. The Herki Kayang is faster in rhythm and is generally danced at romantic occasions. The dance is performed by young men and women. The Shuna Kayang is danced in most villages. Its rhythm combines both slow and fast movements. This represents scenes from village and forest life.  Shand and Shabu  These are the most popular dances of the Lahaul valley and are generally danced at Buddhist Gompas in the memory of the Buddha. Shan means a prayer for Buddha. Dances to these prayers are termed Shan dances. This tribal dance is performed after the completion of the harvest. Instruments include drums, shehnai and a stringed instrument like a violin. A similar dance form known as Shabbo is also performed at festivals. It represents the beliefs and lifestyle of the tribal people. These dance forms are linked to the local festivals.  Tribal dances  The Keekali dance form is a dance of young girls. The girls hold each other's hand crosswise and rotate swiftly on their toes. The Bhangra is a male dance which originated in the Punjab and is also performed in some areas of Una. The dance forms of the trans-Himalayan region differs in content and music. The old tradition of both song and dance in these regions is guarded against urban influence. Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Tehsils of Pangi and Bharmour of Chamba constitute this zone. Inhabitants are known as Kinnauras, Lahaulas, Spitians, Pangwals and Gaddis. Gujjars and many of these tribes have their own distinct traditions of folk dances, songs, dresses and ornaments. Many ritual dances are performed by Lamas on festive occasions. One masked dance form mainly features an important event in the history of Himalayan Buddhism when Lamas effectively carried out a plan of executing King Langdarma. A special event for masked dances is the celebration of the birth of Padma Sambhava (who carried the message of Buddhism to Tibet.)details on Keekli and bhangra danceforms @webindia123.com References Category:Culture of Himachal Pradesh ","title":"Traditional dances of Himachal Pradesh"},{"id":"10981682","text":"Matthew Hoch (born December 29, 1975 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an American academic and teacher of singing.

A \\"fayre\\" in every sense of the word, it featured a host of different types of performances, media, experimental theatre and rock, punk, folk and reggae music. The first Fayre was tiny, attracting only 1500 or so, but the attendance increased over the years as the organisers booked better known acts, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, and The Fall. The organisers decided to close down the festival after 1986 because of hard drug use and vandalism.History of the Elephant Fayre History In 1980 a small festival which had outgrown its site at Polgooth in mid-Cornwall approached the Port Eliot estate and asked if it could be held in the idyllic grounds. The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s, which was named after the elephant in the Eliot family’s crest. A prime attraction of the event was a giant wooden elephant which could be mounted via an internal ladder. The festival ran from 1981–1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts. Over the years the festival grew, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 and bands such as The Cure, The Fall and Siouxsie and the Banshees. By 1986 the festival, like so many of the time, had become victim of its own success. The tolerance of the free festival culture of the 70s was over, as New Age Travellers became a focus for disorder across the country. Despite the tolerance of the then Lord Eliot and fellow festival benefactor Michael Eavis at Glastonbury (known affectionately in festival crew parlance as 'The Good Lord and The Worthy Farmer') the travellers put paid, it was said, to the Elephant Fayre and seriously compromised Glastonbury. Whilst the festival at Port Eliot had built up a reputation as one of the best in the country, with extraordinary acts and the liberal attitude of the organisers, it was alleged the travellers had taken advantage and destroyed the festival. The burning down of the oldest tree in the park, looting of the village surgery and the robbing of stall-holders prompted Lord Eliot and fellow organisers to make the 1986 festival the last. The Elephant Fayre has reinvented itself and is now the Port Eliot Festival. It describes itself as having \\"All the brains of a literary festival. All the soul of a music festival.\\" It is held mid summer.

It was famously set to music by Felix Mendelssohn as a secular cantata for soloists (alto, tenor, baritone, bass), choir, and orchestra. He completed an initial version in 1831, and extensively revised it before publishing it as his Opus 60 in 1843. The composition consists of ten movements, including the programmatic overture, lasting about 36 minutes: *Ouvertüre: Das schlechte Wetter – Der Übergang zum Frühling (Overture: Bad weather – Transition to Spring) # \\"Es lacht der Mai\\" (May is in full bloom): tenor & chorus of Druids & people. # \\"Könnt ihr so verwegen handeln?\\" (Could you be so rash, so daring?): lto, old woman, & chorus of wives of the people. # \\"Wer Opfer heut zu bringen scheut\\" (Whoever fears to sacrifice): baritone, priest, & chorus of Druids. # \\"Verteilt euch, wackre Männer, hier\\" (Divide your forces, valiant men): chorus of Druid watchmen. # \\"Diese dummen Pfaffenchristen\\" (Christians and their priests are witless): bass, watchman, & chorus of watchmen. # \\"Kommt mit Zacken und mit Gabeln\\" (Come with prongs and pitchforks): chorus of Druids and people. # \\"So weit gebracht, dass wir bei Nacht\\" (It's come so far that now by night): baritone, priest, & chorus of Druids and people. # \\"Hilf, ach hilf mir, Kriegsgeselle\\" (Help, oh help me, comrade): tenor & chorus of Christian watchmen. # \\"Die Flamme reinigt sich vom Rauch\\" (The flame cleanses itself of smoke): baritone, priest, & chorus of Druids and people. Goethe wrote this text to be set to music, intending it for his friend Carl Friedrich Zelter, who tried twice, in 1799 and 1812, but did not complete a setting. Mendelssohn, who knew Goethe, first took it up in 1830 and it was first performed in Berlin on 10 Janyary 1833. The story is about how a prank allows for a local tradition to take place in spite of opposition from an intolerant new regime. The Druids and local heathen would celebrate May Day, but, as a women's chorus warns, this is now forbidden. The Druid priests counter that those who fear to sacrifice deserve their chains. A comic solution emerges as a Druid watchman suggests a masquerade of the Devil, spirits, and demons to frighten the occupying Christians. The Christians are scared away, and the Druids and heathen are left to celebrate Spring and the Sun. The attractions of this text for Mendelssohn likely were the ghost scene (compare his incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream) and the triumph (by guile) of an oppressed group in an occupied land, an important Enlightenment idea, as well as one perhaps reflecting the composer's Jewish background: the final verses of the oratorio emphasize an abstract divinity (\\"dein Licht\\") over a threatened earthly ritual (\\"den alten Brauch\\"). According to Melvin Berger, Mendelssohn was raised a Protestant but \\"was never fully accepted as a Christian by his contemporaries, nor was he ever fully cut off from his Judaic heritage.\\" Consequently, Recordings * 1952, Igor Markevitch, Vienna Symphony, Wiener Singakademie, Sieglinde Wagner (alto), Anton Dermota (tenor), Otto Edelmann (bass) * 1969, Frederic Waldman, Musica Aeterna Orchestra & Chorus, Lili Chookasian (alto), Ernst Haefliger (tenor), Hermann Prey (baritone), Raymond Michalski (bass) * 1974, Kurt Masur, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Leipzig Radio Choir, Annelies Burmeister (alto), Eberhard Büchner (tenor), Siegfried Lorenz (baritone), Siegfried Vogel (bass) * 1978, Christoph von Dohnányi, Vienna Philharmonic, Wiener Singverein, Margarita Lilowa (alto), Horst Laubenthal (tenor), Tom Krause (baritone), (bass) * 1990, Michel Corboz, Gulbenkian Orchestra, Gulbenkian Choir, Brigitte Balleys (alto), Frieder Lang (tenor), Gilles Cachemaille (baritone) * 1993, Francesco D'Avalos, Philharmonia Orchestra, Philharmonia Chorus, Jean Rigby (alto), Robert Tear (tenor), Anthony Michaels-Moore (baritone), Richard Van Allan (bass) * 1997, Claus Peter Flor, Bamberg Symphony Orchestra and Choir, Jadwiga Rappé (alto), Deon van der Walt (tenor), Anton Scharinger (baritone), Matthias Hölle (bass) * 2016, Douglas Boyd, Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur, Zürcher Sing- Akademie, Birgit Remmert (alto), Jörg Dürmüller (tenor), (baritone), Reinhard Mayr (bass) Notes Sources * * External links * *\\"Die erste Walpurgisnacht\\", chapter 113 in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: Gedichte., Artemis (1949) Category:Poetry by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Category:Cantatas Category:Compositions by Felix Mendelssohn Category:1831 compositions Category:1843 compositions Category:Walpurgis Night fiction ","title":"Die erste Walpurgisnacht"},{"id":"10981773","text":"The R.

Appearances As one can never tell if Self intends there to be a coherent storyline, piecing together a backstory for Dr. Busner can be exceedingly difficult. In the story \\"Inclusion\\", he is seemingly absorbed by the character Simon Dykes. While some might consider this the end of Busner, he reappears in Great Apes. Employment and characteristics He apparently holds an institutional position in the stories \\"Dr. Mukti\\" and \\"Ward 9\\". Because his previous work is referenced throughout the latter, it can be safely assumed that these events take place after \\"The Quantity Theory of Insanity\\". Busner has also lectured for the Royal Society of Ephemera and has written numerous pieces for their British Journal of Ephemera. It was in this publication that \\"The Quantity Theory of Insanity\\" was first published. Despite his age and failing health in \\"Dr. Mukti\\" he still provides a formidable opponent to the eponymous character. He is shown to be able to not only accurately predict people's behaviour but to use this along with manipulation to ensure his preferred outcome. In the short story Inclusion Busner muses that although Psychiatry has been his main focus, he could have gone into any number of fields and that a good epitaph for him might be \\"He had no interests but interest.\\" In an interview with DNA India, Self described the similarities between Busner and himself: > We both grew up in North London; we're both of Jewish heritage (although him > more than me), we're both philosophically inclined, we're both highly > sexual, we're both rebellious, we're both obsessed by mental illness > (although him as a practitioner, me as a writer), we've both been married > more than once and have numerous children, we both affect a certain > dishabille, we both like Jimi Hendrix.

The core is compatible with the older PowerPC Book E specification as well as the Power ISA v.2.03. It has a dual issue, seven-stage pipeline with FPUs (from version 2 onwards), 32/32 KiB data and instruction L1 caches and 256, 512 or 1024 KiB L2 frontside cache. Speeds range from 533 MHz up to 1.5 GHz, and the core is designed to be highly configurable and meet the specific needs of embedded applications with features like multi-core operation interface for auxiliary application processing units (APU). e500 powers the high-performance PowerQUICC III system on a chip (SoC) network processors and they all share a common naming scheme, MPC85xx. Freescale's new QorIQ is the evolutionary step from PowerQUICC III and will also be based on e500 cores.  Versions  There are three versions of the e500 core, namely the original e500v1, the e500v2 and the e500mc. A 64-bit evolution of the e500mc core is called the e5500 core and was introduced in 2010, and a subsequent e6500 core added multithreading capabilities in 2012.  e500v1  *Support for the SPE (Signal Processing Engine) extensions. The integer register file is extended to a width of 64-bits. The non-SPE instructions only access and write to the low 32-bits. However the SIMD SPE instructions read and write from the full 64-bits. These extensions overlap with the string and AltiVec instructions. *Support for SPESFP (Single Precision Embedded Scalar Floating Point). This is a new floating point unit that is distinct from the classic FPU, the latter of which is lacking in e500v1 and e500v2. SPESFP uses the integer register file. It is not completely IEEE754 compliant.  e500v2  Key improvements in the e500v2 over the e500v1 include: * Increase from 32-bit (4 GiB) to 36-bit (64 GiB) physical address space. This change means that e500v2-based devices often use a more advanced board support package (BSP) than e500v1-based devices, as various peripheral units have moved to physical addresses higher than 4 GiB. * Addition of 1 GiB and 4 GiB variable-page sizes * Addition of DPESFP (double- precision embedded scalar floating point) support. Building on top of SPESFP, these instructions access both halves of the 64-bit integer register. * Doubling in size and associativity of the MMU's second-level 4K-page array (from 256-entry 2-way to 512-entry 4-way) * Increase from 3 to 5 maximum outstanding data cache misses * Addition of the Alternate Time Base for cycle- granularity timestamps  e500mc  Freescale introduced the e500mc in the QorIQ family of chips in June 2008. The e500mc has the following features: * Power ISA v.2.06, which includes hypervisor and virtualization functionality for embedded platforms. * The \\"classic\\" floating-point unit has been reinstated. * SPE, SPESFP, and DPESFP are all removed, and the integer register file is back to 32 bits. * Support anything from two to more than 32 cores (not necessarily the same type of cores) on a single chip. * Supports the CoreNet communications fabric for connecting cores and datapath accelerators. * e500mc cores have private L2 caches but typically share other facilities like L3 caches, memory controllers, application specific acceleration cores, I/O and such.  Applications   PowerQUICC  All PowerQUICC 85xx devices are based on e500v1 or e500v2 cores, most of them on the latter.

He played professionally for seven years in Italy: he scored 124 goals in 187 matches for Juventus F.C., and won two Serie A championships with the club, finishing as Capocannoniere top-goal scorer in the 1951–52 Serie A season; he later also played for Italian club S.S. Lazio. He won the 1944 Danish championship with childhood club BK Frem. Hansen scored 10 goals in eight games for the Denmark national football team in 1948, and won a bronze medal with Denmark at the 1948 Summer Olympics. In 1985, Hansen received the Italian order of chivalry. He was the son of Danish international goalkeeper Niels Peder Hansen, who also played for BK Frem, and was the father of Henning Hansen, who played for BK Frem in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Playing career Amateur career Born in Frederiksberg,John Hansen at Haslund.info Hansen started his career with Copenhagen club BK Frem in the amateur-only Danish league. He played as a left inside wing, was a world-class header of the ball, and could kick the ball equally hard with both legs. With BK Frem, Hansen won the 1944 Danish championship, and was the top goal-scorer of the 1948 Danish championship tournament. Hansen made his debut for the Danish national team in June 1948, and scored three goals in his first two international games. Playing in the Danish amateur league and having played just two international games, he was not well known outside Scandinavia until he was selected for the Danish team at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Hansen scored seven goals in four games as Denmark won bronze medals at the tournament, including four goals in Denmark's 5–3 win against the Italian national team. Hansen's Olympic performance made his name well known across Europe, and drew the attention of several Italian teams. He signed a professional contract in late 1948, which spelled the end of his career in the amateur-only Danish national team following eight games and 10 goals in the span of four months. Professional career 1951–52 season Hansen was almost hired by Italian club A.C. Torino, but arch rival Turin club Juventus F.C. eventually secured Hansen's signature. BK Frem's president got a call from a director at Nordisk FIAT Copenhagen, referred by FIAT and Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli, who desperately wanted him to sign Hansen for his club. As Hansen was an amateur, he was free to move and promptly signed a three-year contract with Juventus on 16 November 1948 for DKK111,111.11 ($23,500).Steen Ankerdal, \\"Landsholdet\\", Aschehoug, 2006, p.72 He was given the number 10 shirt, and made his debut three days later against A.S. Bari. Hansen's first season didn't start well for a tall and strong man not used to work on defense, and after 12 games the Italian national team coach was called just to verify that he was the same player who had scored the four goals against them at the Olympics. Hansen ended his first season with 15 goals in 24 games. In his second season, Jesse Carver replaced fellow Englishman William Chalmers as head coach of Juventus, and a less rigid and physically demanding training schedule paid off for Hansen. In the 1949–50 Juventus team, Hansen had an irreplaceable partner in another Danish player from the 1948 Olympics team, Karl Aage Præst. Præst was a left winger with electric dribbling skills who scattered opponents through the field and produced precise crosses to Hansen, who netted them thanks to his violent and precise header. Juventus won the 1949–50 Serie A championship with Hansen scoring 28 goals in 37 games. In 1950, Hansen and Præst were joined by another Dane, captain of the 1948 Olympic team Karl Aage Hansen, who came from Serie A league rivals Atalanta Bergamo. The great level of understanding of those three great Danes made John Hansen feel as if he could play with his eyes closed, showing all of his skills. Not the kind of player to be present at every moment during a game, he was a very prolific goal scorer. Though he was not fast by Serie A standard, he was smart at the moment of getting unmarked and losing his defender, and had an incredible feeling for being at the right spot on the right moment. During the 1951–52 Serie A season, Hansen scored 30 goals, earning him the \\"Capocannoniere\\" Italian top goal-scorer title, as he won his second Serie A championship with Juventus. He spent six seasons at Juventus where he scored 124 goals in 187 games in the Serie A. He moved to league rivals S.S. Lazio in 1954, where he played for one season and scored 15 goals in 27 games. He ended his Italian adventure in 1955 and moved back to Denmark. The strictly amateur Danish Football Association would not allow ex-professional John Hansen to play in the Danish leagues, and he and fellow Olympic teammate and ex- professional Jørgen Leschly Sørensen took to playing exhibition games. These games had free admittance and gathered such large crowds,Steen Ankerdal, \\"Landsholdet\\", Aschehoug, 2006, p.115 that the Danish Football Association in 1958 decided to allow ex-professionals to reenter the Danish league, albeit only after serving a two-year quarantine. Hansen returned to play for BK Frem, where he ended his playing career in 1960. Coaching career During his ban from playing football in 1956 and 1957, Hansen coached BK Frem alongside Erling Sørensen. In February 1969, Hansen became a member of the selection committee which selected the players for the Danish national team. At the same time he agreed a one-year deal to replace Erik Hansen as part-time tactical coach of the national team, where he worked in tandem with physical trainer Henry From. They managed Denmark to five victories, one draw, and three defeats in nine games. When the year was up, Hansen refused to prolong the arrangement, urging the Football Association to hire a full-time national team coach.Steen Ankerdal, \\"Landsholdet\\", Aschehoug, 2006, p.121 Austrian Rudi Strittich was named national team coach in 1970, replacing both Hansen and From, and John Hansen went on to only serve in the selection committee.

Elgindy gained a reputation for his \\"investigations\\" of companies. Towards the end of his life, Elgindy was convicted of insider trading and served seven years in federal prison. Born in Egypt as Amr Ibrahim Elgindy, Elgindy was known professionally as \\"Anthony@Pacific\\", the \\"Internet's most theatrical short-seller\\".  Early career  Elgindy originally worked as a car salesman in San Diego. In 1988, he became a stock trader working for penny stock brokerage Blinder Robinson. He later moved to another brokerage house, Armstrong McKinley. When Armstrong McKinley came under investigation for taking bribes to recommend stock, Elgindy provided incriminating information to prosecutors. In 1995, Elgindy became a short seller.  Exposing unethical companies  During the mid 1990's, he began publishing on short selling message boards. He soon became known for exposing companies that he believed were engaging in unethical and illegal activity that inflated their stock. An adverse posting about a company from Elgindy could allegedly cause a company's stock to decline sharply. In 1999, He launched Pacific Equity Investigations in 1999, using his earlier experience working in boiler rooms to expose fraud.  Law enforcement information scheme  After 2000, Elgindy began working with FBI agent Jeff Broyer. Elgindy gave Broyer the names of companies that he believed were engaging in illegal activity, and Broyer used FBI databases to search for any investigations into those companies by the FBI or the SEC. Broyer then funneled information on any pending investigations to Elgindy, who used that information to short sell the stock. He was not above extorting executives into giving him stock in order to make him back off his attacks on them. After the September 11 attacks, the FBI began investigating Elgindy after receiving a tip that he might have had foreknowledge of the attacks.. The investigation found no evidence of that. However, the Elgindy investigation did uncover his relationship with Broyer. Broyer resigned and began working directly for Elgindy. Broyer's girlfriend, FBI agent Lynn Wingate, continuing to funnel information to Elgindy. In 2002, Elgindy, Broyer and Wingate were indicted for their roles in the scheme.  NASD investigation  In 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) ruled that Elgindy and his firm Key West Securities \\"engaged in a manipulative scheme in 1997 to inflate artificially the share price of Saf T Lok, Inc. through the entering of fraudulent quotations in the NASDAQ system, selling the stock short at the artificially high prices, and then taking active steps to depress the share price of Saf T Lok through the dissemination of negative research comments.\\" Elgindy and Key West Securities were fined $51,000 and had their NASD memberships revoked. In 2004, the SEC reversed the ban on appeal.  2005 indictment  In a superseding indictment issued in January 2005, Elgindy was charged with racketeering, securities fraud and other crimes. This included his scheme to steal information about FBI and separate SEC investigations of various companies. Elgindy was accused of insider-trading involving 32 different stocks, including the stock of Genesis Intermedia, Inc. (GENI), After a four-month trial, Elgindy was convicted of \\"inside-trading\\" in five stocks with illegal gains totaling about $66,000.  Aftermath  Elgindy was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. He was released in late 2013 after serving almost seven years. Elgindy committed suicide on July 23, 2015.

Following the implementation of Companies Act in 2006, the company changed its type to kabushiki gaisha and continues its operation as . The word is a classical Japanese adjectival noun meaning \\"righteously arranged and elegant\\", typically used to praise the beauty of a kimono or buyō (Japanese dance). This name was chosen to counter the public image of adult goods, and with an aim to create high-quality products with new ideas.Ogiue 2011, p. 212. , 28 employees work in the company (including the board of directors), with 8 of them female. One of the directors is , who is responsible for the company's Overseas Business Department. Sato is a Masturbate-a-thon champion who achieved a world record for the \\"longest time spent masturbating/male\\" in 2008 (9 hours 33 minutes). In 2009, he extended his own record to 9 hours 58 minutes. He has been participating in the competitions using a set of Tenga masturbators of his own. Products Tenga offers several product categories. Disposable \\"Cup\\" series which are intended for one-time use only (which can be reused if washed correctly), \\"Flip\\" series that split open to be easily washable and reusable, compact \\"Egg\\" series which resemble Easter eggs and stretch when in use, and \\"Tenga 3D\\" series which are intended to be reversed when not in use, showing its geometric patterns. Other accessories include lotions (lubricants), electrical \\"Tenga Warmers\\", and \\"Hole Warmers\\" (a stick- shaped hand warmer that uses supersaturated sodium acetate). Design and functionality Rolling Head Cup (Hard), Black Tenga series, notable for unique movements possible by the white bellows as described in the text. Tenga does not design their products as a replacement of human vagina. Erotic or sexual imagery are deliberately avoided in the product design and advertising.Ogiue 2011, p. 184. The products and their packaging are designed by a consumer goods stylist retained by Matsumoto. They typically feature solid colors of red, white, black, or gray, and have been described as \\"stylish\\" and as \\"Apple of the sex toy industry.\\" The design lessens embarrassment for potential customers. One of their product \\"Rolling Head Cup\\" exemplifies the disconnection of the stimulatory function from appearance or simulation of ordinary sexual activity. The bellows in the middle allows for the top of the product to be swiveled around in a movement that is not analogous to sexual intercourse. Due to its functionality, the product \\"Tenga Cup\\" is the most recommended product among 30 masturbation cups. Tenga Cups are equipped with a valve to control the internal pressure of the unit when inserted. A vacuum-like atmosphere can be created, which creates suction on the penis. The interiors of Cups, Eggs and Flips are fabricated using elastomer;Ogiue 2011, p. 195. with the 3Ds using an Ag antibacterial form of that material. Sales In the lineup's first year (2005), 1 million units were sold. Since then, cumulative sales have reached 19 million units of masturbators sold worldwide (). Japan accounts for about 80% of the sales, where 13,000 units are sold daily. Tenga is a relatively well-known brand in Japan for a masturbator, with its brand recognition rate exceeding 55% among males in their 20s, and approximately 47% among males in their 30s. The remaining 20% of the sales are divided among 41 other countries,Ogiue 2011, p. 215. most prominently the United States, Spain, and China. Counterfeit products which resemble Tenga have been reported in China, ranging from products which only mimics the color and tone of the original package design to a product that is virtually indistinguishable from the original. Range =Tenga Cup= Tenga's signature single-use disposable masturbation toy with vacuum suction functionality, shaped like a cup. It comes in several different varieties featuring different textures and levels of firmness. =Tenga Flip Hole= A reusable masturbation sleeve and case, which includes similar vacuum functionality to the disposable cups. It comes in four different colors; white, black, red and silver. Each color offers a different sensation with different inner sleeve lining. The flip hole uses a clamshell design with the intent to be easy to use and clean, including the ability to air dry after use. The Flip Hole can be used up to 50 times. Tenga also released a new version of the flip hole called Flip Air, however it was discontinued in spring 2012. They later introduced another successor called the Flip 0 (Zero), which uses more intricate internal textures and a different hinge mechanism for opening. The Flip 0 line includes the Flip 0 EV, which includes a pair of \\"vibrating cores\\" embedded in the elastomer for added stimulation. =Tenga 3D= The 3D range lies somewhere between the Tenga Cup and Tenga Flip Hole, both in product and price. It is a reusable sleeve available in five different textures/sensations. The sleeve can be turned inside out after use for easy cleaning and drying. Similar to the Flip Hole, the 3D can be used 50 times before disposing. =Tenga Egg= The Egg is a super stretchy and elastic egg-shaped masturbator. There are eighteen different textures/sensations and are designed to fit all sizes due to its elasticity. The cheapest of Tenga's product lines, like the cup it is designed as a single-use disposable toy. =VI-BO= Tenga's first attempt at a couples vibrator, the VI-BO is a vibrating orb that fits into 5 different 'covers'. Each cover features a different color and shape which allows use of the orb in various ways. =Iroha= On 3 March 2012, Tenga released a new brand named Iroha (イロハ), featuring a lineup of three vibrators designed for women. The products were endorsed by the former AV idol Yuka Minena.Former AV actress endorses Tenga’s Iroha masturbation machine for women, The Tokyo Reporter, March 18, 2013 As of early 2020, Iroha had expanded from its original product line to nine different ones, all of which are women's vibrators of some sort. =Tenga Spinner= The Spinner is masturbation sleeve with a coiled plastic spring embedded into the elastomer, which generates twisting motions during use. =Tenga Air-Tech= A toy line with a design heavily based on the original line of disposable cups, but it is re- usable due to its internal elastomer sleeve being thicker and more durable, and its outer shell allowing disassembly for cleaning. Its vacuum suction capability is also advertised as being stronger than the original cups. Unlike most Tenga products it is not exported to the American market, but it is available in Europe. Awards The \\"Tenga 3D\\" series was awarded the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2012 in Germany. According to Tenga, this is the first time for a male masturbation aid to receive this award. This was not the first time that Tenga was considered for an award in product designing. In 2006, Tenga passed the first round of screening for the Good Design Award by the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization, but was excluded before the beginning of the second screening due to it being determined as \\"ineligible\\" by the judging committee. The award did not give specific reasons why it was not eligible, but third-party writers have speculated that the sexual nature of the product was the reason for the exclusion. Matsumoto criticized the decision saying that Tenga is but a manufacturing company, and the decision \\"tramples the passions of manufacturing industries.\\" Clinical usage At least two independent groups in Japan have put Tenga products to clinical usage. Kobori et al. at Dokkyo Medical University have applied Tenga for ejaculatory dysfunction studies. Imai et al. at Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital have used Tenga on a number of patients suffering from intravaginal anejaculation or post-prostatectomy dysfunction. In their paper, Kobori et al. gave the following reasons why they chose to utilize Tenga for their purposes: *They are in widespread use and can be bought in general variety stores or bookshops *They enable a constant grip pressure to be maintained *The lineup offers three different standard levels of stimulation (hard, standard, soft), enabling support for various cases *They are disposable and hygienic *They do not have decorative imitations that resemble human vagina, and their designs are suitable for medical use *The manufacturer and the distributor are well- known Comic adaptation In 2008, comic artist drew a picture depicting the masturbators as fictional girls (a form of moe anthropomorphism). The concept was given the from . Tenga Co., Ltd. gave permission to make this concept into a commercial project; and in 2010, the concept was expanded into an electronic comic series titled Tengirls, published by Sony Digital Entertainment Services Inc. (a subsidiary of Sony). The story features a team of girls resembling the Tenga products, who fight against crimes and disasters that occur in a near- future city.

(2006) Oxford University Press Plot Derived from the 1970s musical The Time Lord by Soames and Daniels, it focuses on contemporary rock musician Chris Wilder, who has been transported with his backup singers and band from a concert to the High Court of the Universe in the Andromeda Galaxy. In light of mankind's strides in space exploration, the Time Lord Melchisedic (loosely based on the title character in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who) has decided the time has come to examine Earth's people to determine what role they will play in the quest for universal peace, and Wilder and his band are called upon to defend their planet. Productions The heavily amplified multi-media event relied heavily on special effects, including a huge projected floating head named Akash (billed by the show's producers as a hologram) that served as a narrator throughout the show.

Bodies which fund research, such as the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and the EU with its Framework programs, have a tendency to fund larger- scale research projects. Reasons include the idea that ambitious research needs significant resources devoted for its execution and the reduction of administrative and overhead costs on the funding body side. However, small science which has data that is often local and is not easily shared is funded in many areas such as chemistry and biology by these funding bodies. The importance of Small Science Small Science helps define the goals and directions of large scale scientific projects. In turn, results of large scale projects are often best synthesized and interpreted by the long-term efforts of the Small Science community. In addition, because Small Science is typically done at universities, it provides students and young researchers with an integral involvement in defining and solving scientific problems. Hence, small science can be seen as an important factor for bringing together science and society. According to the Chronicle for Higher Education, James M. Caruthers, a professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University, data from Big Science is highly organized on the front end where researchers define it before it even starts rolling off the machines, making it easier to handle, understand, and archive. Small Science is \\"horribly heterogeneous,\\" and far more vast. In time, Small Science will generate two to three times more data than Big Science.Lost in a Sea of Science Data http://chronicle.com/article/Lost-in-a-Sea-of-Science-Data/9136 The American Geophysical Union stresses the importance of small science in a position statement.The Need for Balance between Small and Large Science, available at http://www.agu.org/sci_pol/positions/smallsci.shtml Examples of Small Science results with high impact Many historical examples show that results of Small Science can have enormous impacts: * Galois theory, one of the foundational theories of abstract algebra was developed by Évariste Galois within just weeks. * Albert Einstein developed his theory of Special relativity as a hobby while working full-time in a patent office. * Robert Goddard invented the liquid propelled and multi stage rockets largely on his own.

Barnes-Homer started his career as a youth player at Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he spent three years. He went on to have short spells at three clubs in the lower leagues of the United States of America football pyramid during 2004, before returning to England with Aldershot Town. He then played for various non-league clubs in his local West Midlands region between 2005 and 2007 until League Two side Wycombe Wanderers signed him on a short-term contract in March 2007. He was released shortly afterwards, where he joined Conference National side Kidderminster Harriers. After a lean first season at the club, Barnes-Homer established himself as top scorer in the next campaign with 21 goals, averaging almost one goal for every two games. A similar goal return during 2009–10 prompted interest from former Football League club Luton Town, who signed him in January 2010. He finished the 2010–11 season as Luton's top scorer with 19 goals. He left Luton in early 2012, going on to spend four months at Swedish side Östersunds FK, before returning to the Conference with Macclesfield Town for the start of the 2012–13 season. In August 2013, he signed a two-year contract with Forest Green Rovers. On 10 January 2014, Barnes-Homer signed for Cambridge United on a free transfer until the end of the season. Club career Born in Dudley, West Midlands, Barnes-Homer began his career as a 15-year-old trainee at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was released three years later at the end of the 2003–04 season. He went to the United States where he played for Rochester Rhinos, Syracuse Salty Dogs and Virginia Beach Mariners, before heading back to England to join Aldershot Town in 2004, where he made two appearances. He then joined Hednesford Town, where he made one substitute appearance, and was signed by Bromsgrove Rovershttp://www.aylesburyunitedfc.co.uk/players/matthew- barnes-homer in April 2005 after impressing in Bromsgrove's reserve side. Barnes-Homer had a short spell at Tividale before he joined Willenhall Town in August 2008 and scored a hat-trick on his debut against Stourbridge. After impressive performances for Willenhall, he joined League Two club Wycombe Wanderers in March 2007 after a successful trial. However, he was one of several players released at the end of the 2006–07 season after Wycombe failed to reach the League Two play-offs. He joined Conference Premier side Kidderminster Harriers in July 2007 after featuring in pre-season games. After scoring 6 league goals during the 2007–08 season, he signed a new one-year contract in April 2008. Barnes-Homer scored 21 goals the next season, ending the campaign as highest goalscorer at the club as Kidderminster finished narrowly outside the play-offs. He signed a new two-year contract with the club in June 2009. Barnes-Homer began the 2009–10 season for Kidderminster as he had finished the last, with a return of roughly one goal in every two games. His goalscoring form did not go unnoticed and, on 26 November 2009, Barnes-Homer joined Luton Town, initially on a one-month loan deal. On 13 January 2010 the transfer led to a permanent two-and-a-half-year-contract, for which Luton paid Kidderminster a five-figure fee, believed to be around £75,000. Barnes-Homer made a below-average start to his Luton career, with just three goals in 20 league games. Luton manager Richard Money cited the fact that Barnes-Homer had lost his stepfather mid-season as reason for his poor form. Money believed that in the following season, Luton fans would see the real Matthew Barnes-Homer and that he would be akin to a brand new signing. This faith from the manager paid off, as Barnes-Homer scored five goals in the opening three games of the 2010–11 season, including a hat-trick away against Kettering Town. He fell out of favour with new Luton manager Gary Brabin towards the end of the season, being used primarily as a substitute, including in the club's play-off final defeat to AFC Wimbledon. Barnes-Homer ended the season as Luton's top scorer with 19 goals, 16 of which game in the league. He started Luton's first game of the 2011–12 season, though was substituted after an hour. On 25 August 2011, Barnes-Homer joined League One side Rochdale on loan until January 2012, making only five league appearances in five months. He left Luton on 1 January 2012, his contract terminated by mutual consent. On the decision to terminate Barnes-Homer's contract, Luton manager Gary Brabin stated \\"I just felt from the beginning of the season that it wasn't going to work out, that's why we decided to loan him to Rochdale. It hasn't worked out for him there and I didn't feel it was going to be right for him to come back.\\" On 24 February 2012, Barnes-Homer joined Conference North side Nuneaton Town. He made only one appearance for the club in the Birmingham Senior Cup before leaving on 20 March to join Swedish third division side Östersunds FK. He played in 11 league games, scoring twice, before returning to England on 27 June to sign for Macclesfield Town in the Conference Premier. On 5 January 2013, he scored both goals late on in a third round FA Cup tie for Macclesfield against Championship leaders Cardiff City in a 2–1 victory, putting his team through to the fourth round for the first time. Having netted 21 times in league and cup competitions in the 2012–13 season for Macclesfield, he trialled with League One side Notts County but failed to earn a deal. On 27 July 2013, he featured for Conference Premier side Alfreton in a pre-season friendly and just two days later he played over an hour for Forest Green Rovers in their friendly clash with Yeovil Town. After another trial appearance against Weston-super-Mare, he signed a two-year contract with Forest Green on 5 August 2013. He made a goal scoring debut for the club on 10 August 2013 in an 8–0 win against Hyde. In January 2014, just six months into his two-year contract, he moved on a free transfer to Forest Green's league rivals Cambridge United. On 28 February, Barnes-Homer joined Tamworth on loan. The following day he was selected in the starting eleven against FC Halifax Town which Cambridge drew 1–1 despite dominating for longer periods. Cambridge released Barnes-Homer on 27 May 2014. International career Barnes-Homer was named in the England C squad that played Poland under-23's on 17 November 2009. He scored the winning goal on his debut in a 2–1 victory. On 9 February 2011, Barnes-Homer scored the winning goal in a 1–0 win against Belgium under-23's that put England C into the final of the International Challenge Trophy.

The primatial cathedral is in Parma, Ohio (St. Vladimir Cathedral), and the Church's head offices and Consistory are based in South Bound Brook, New Jersey.Constatine of Irinoupolis , aartsbisdom.be; accessed May 18, 2017.Metropolitan Constantine, dies at 76, ncccusa.org; accessed May 18, 2017. Early life Metropolitan Constantine was born in Pittsburgh on July 19, 1936 to Stanley (Stanislav) and Catherine Buggan, a Ukrainian family. Upon completion of his secondary education he entered the College of St. Andrew, in Winnipeg (an affiliate college with the University of Manitoba), Canada, from which he graduated in 1959. He also studied at Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York and Duquesne University, receiving a doctorate in philosophy from the latter. Priesthood and episcopacy On April 23, 1967 he was ordained deacon in South Bound Brook, New Jersey by Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) (future first patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Kyivan Patriarchate), and a priest on July 23 by Metropolitan John (Theodorovich), in Pittsburgh. His pastoral work comprised St. Vladimir Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois and at St Nicholas Church in Troy, New York. Father Theodore was tonsured a monk on December 18, 1971, receiving the name Constantine, and on May 7, 1972, he was consecrated by Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) to the Chicago cathedra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America (UOC in America). In 1977 he was elevated to the rank of archbishop, and to metropolitan in 1992. After the death of Patriarch Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) in 1993 he became the Primate of the UOC in America, and in 1994, of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in the Diaspora. From 1995–96, the UOC in America and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in the Diaspora entered in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Metropolitan Constantine received the titular diocese of Irinoupolis.

It was organized on April 22, 1861, for three-months' service in Indianapolis. After being reorganized for three years' service in late August and early September 1861, the 9th took part in many major battles, including Shiloh, Stones River, Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Kennesaw Mountain and the Siege of Atlanta. The 9th was mustered out on September 28, 1865, after duty at San Antonio and New Braunfels, Texas.Morris, p. 29 and  Personnel  Governor Oliver Hazard Perry Morton appointed Robert H. Milroy as colonel of the 9th on April 26, 1861, nearly two weeks after the firing began at the Battle of Fort Sumter.See appointment letter at Robert H. Milroy after his promotion to Brigadier GeneralBy September 3, 1861, Milroy had become a brigadier general. He continued to command troops in West Virginia (as Commander of the Cheat Mountain District) into 1862.; see also details at Robert H. Milroy An officer of the 9th Indiana Infantry Lt Ambrose Bierce [about 1866] By the time the 9th was assigned to William B. Hazen's 19th Brigade of Buell's Army of the Ohio in March 1862, Colonel Gideon C. Moody, a former prosecutor and politician, commanded the regiment. Hazen called Moody \\"a most gallant officer.\\"Hazen, p. 21. Isaac C.B. Suman, initially the captain of Company H, then became colonel of the 9th. He commanded the 9th during such major battles as Chickamauga. and Cozzens, p. 338 William H. Blake, initially a major, later became colonel of the 9th. Dudley H. Chase served as a captain in Company K of the 9th in the three-month regiment. William P. Lasselle began as a sergeant in Company K in the three-month regiment and finished as a lieutenant colonel in the three- year regiment. James Nutt of Company I began as a first sergeant and ended as a captain of the three-year regiment. Photographs of some of these officers and a number of other officers and enlisted men from the 9th can be found at Indiana Civil War Soldiers, 9th Infantry .The NPS System confirms most of the names listed at as being from the 9th, but we lack confirmation that those pictured are indeed the named soldiers.  Service records  The NPS System includes 816 troop records (three-month) and 2916 troop records (three-year) classified as 9th Regiment, Indiana Infantry. These are not complete listings, and they include a number of apparent duplicates (due to alternate name spellings), but the listings do consist of many useful records. For example, author Ambrose Bierce's record of service in the three-year regiment is as follows: {  - ! No. ! Last, First ! Company ! Rank_In ! Rank_Out -  195  Bierce, Ambrose G.  C  Sergeant  First Lieutenant } Other sources such as the Bierce biography by Roy Morris , or at least the sources Morris relied on, confirm the accuracy of this particular record. Other kinds of service documentation that exist include muster rolls, identification discs, and discharge papers. In the case of the 9th, George Bickel's documentation is representative. Bickel served in Company C of the three-month regiment and, for a short period, in the three-year regiment before he received a medical discharge. Photos of his identification disc, images of the other documentation such as his three-year regiment service papers and a narrative of Bickel's service are available at .  Death Records  Records of some 9th's troops who died during the War can be found at national cemeteries in states where the 9th served, such as Grafton and Shiloh National Cemeteries. = Grafton National Cemetery = According to the available records, 19 soldiers from the 9th are buried at the Grafton National Civil War Cemetery, West Virginia. All of these men were killed in action in what is now West Virginia between the fall of 1861 and the winter of 1861-1862.A listing of the buried at Grafton appears at the Louisiana State University Civil War Center site at . {  - !

Henry Kessler were among those from the 9th killed at the Battle of Stones River on December 31, 1862. 113 men from the 9th were killed or wounded in the battle. Capt. A. Johnson of the 9th and a detail of officers selected the location of the monument on a crest located between the railroad and the Nashville Pike. Lt. Edward Crebbin of the 9th supervised the detachment that constructed the monument in 1863. and Duncan and Klooster, p. 90.  Engagements  9th Infantry Soldiers from the 9th Indiana Infantry were among the first troops of Major General George B. McClellan’s Department of the Ohio to enter western Virginia in the spring of 1861. As the first Indiana regiment to depart, the 9th was reviewed by Governor Morton and General McClellan, then departed for Grafton, Virginia (now Grafton, West Virginia) via railroad at midnight on May 29, 1861. Crowds in central Ohio cheered for the troops as the train passed. and Morris, p. 24  Battle of Philippi  June 3, 1861. After some skirmishes at Grafton, one of the first land battles of the Civil War, the Battle of Philippi, took place in Philippi, Barbour County, in what is now West Virginia.See Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861) for an article on a small battle which occurred in Fairfax County, Virginia, between the Virginia (Confederate) Warrenton Rifles militia company and a company of the 2d U.S. Cavalry Regiment on June 1, 1861, two days before the Battle of Philippi. The battle began when a Federal battery started lobbing shells into a camp of around 825 and surprised Confederate recruits who had been asleep. In response, the Confederates ran, thus earning the battle the name “Philippi Races.” After the battle, the 9th camped on the same hill where the battery was located.Morris, pp. 25-26 Ambrose Bierce mentioned being at Philippi Races. He had enlisted as a private in Company C. Years later, in 1903, Bierce revisited the town. He recalled that visit and the battle in a 1904 piece written for the Eighth Annual Reunion of the 9th Indiana, noting that the Union battery involved \\"did nothing worse than take off a young Confederate's leg.\\" Bierce, p. 37  Battle of Laurel Mountain  July 7–11, 1861. The Battle of Laurel Mountain, also known as Laurel Hill, pitted 3,500 forces under Union Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris against what Morris perceived to be superior forces of 4,000 under Confederate Brigadier General Robert S. Garnett. McClellan had ordered Morris to occupy Garnett while McClellan's own force of 5,000 attacked 1,300 men under Lt. Col. John Pegram at Rich Mountain.See the Battle of Rich Mountain and for more information As part of Morris' brigade, the 9th Indiana, taking cover behind trees, exchanged fire with Confederates, who were behind breastworks. Tiring of the stalemate that ensued, the Union troops charged the breastworks and did \\"well enough, considering the hopeless folly of the movement,\\" according to Ambrose Bierce. After Corporal Dyson Boothroyd of the 9th's Company A was wounded in the neck and paralyzed during the charge, Bierce carried Boothroyd \\"fully 20 rods\\" (100 m) under enemy fire to safety, only to see him die later, according to an Indianapolis Journal reporter's account. Garnett and his forces retreated to the Cheat River, 10 miles to the northeast. The 9th along with the rest of Morris' brigade (including the Seventh Indiana and the 14th Ohio) pursued Garnett to Corrick's Ford.Morris, pp. 27-29 and  Battle of Corrick's Ford  July 12–14, 1861. Heavy rains complicated Garnett's retreat, resulting in a wagon train becoming mired in the mud at Corrick's Ford, located east of Philippi near St. George (now St. George, West Virginia). By July 13, 1861, the bulk of Garnett's troops had moved north of Job's Ford, near Parsons on the Cheat River. During their retreat, they had crossed the river numerous times to evade the Union forces. To ensure the escape of most of his forces, Garnett ordered the 23rd Virginia Infantry to make a stand in a laurel thicket on the east side of Shaver's Fork at Corrick's Ford. He stayed with this regiment and used the wagon train in the mud as a decoy. This planned ambush ultimately failed. Morris' brigade successfully attacked and displaced the 23rd, and a member of the Seventh Indiana managed to shoot Garnett in the spine, killing him.  Battle of Cheat Mountain  September 12–16, 1861. Morris asserts that the 9th was in Elkwater on September 12 and was not engaged during Lee's attack, but another source states that a column of Lee's attacked Elkwater on or about September 12, and that the Unionists drove them off with no difficulty. Bierce didn't mention this attack in any of his surviving writings.  Battle of Greenbrier River]  October 3–4, 1861. Bierce did mention the fighting at Greenbrier River, which he called a \\"reconnaissance in force.\\" A Union force of 5,000 under Joseph J. Reynolds exchanged artillery fire with a Confederate force of 2,000 under H.R. Jackson remaining at Camp Bartow to guard the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike. The Confederates succeeded in defending the road because their artillery was well placed, protected and effective. During a 1903 visit to the site, Bierce noted Union graves, most of which had been opened, with the bodies relocated to the National Cemetery at Grafton. He observed that some graves had been apparently overlooked. There were also between 80 and 100 graves behind the Confederate earthworks that were neglected. One of the bodies initially buried at Greenbrier River was that of J.A. Abbott of Bierce's company. After a 1909 visit to the area, Bierce recounted the manner of Abbott's death, although he did not personally witness it: \\"He was lying flat upon his stomach and was killed by being struck in the side by a nearly spent cannon-shot that came rolling in among us. The shot remained in him until removed. It was a solid round-shot, apparently cast in some private foundry, whose proprietor, setting the laws of thrift above those of ballistics, had put his 'imprint' upon it; upon it: it bore, in slightly sunken letters, the name 'Abbott.'\\"Bierce, p. 75.  Battle of Camp Allegheny  December 13, 1861. The 9th formed part of a brigade under their old regimental commander, now Brigadier General Robert H. Milroy, that attacked Col. Edward Johnson's forces protecting the Staunton- Parkersburg Pike. They exchanged fire for a good portion of that morning, and the Confederates managed to force a Union retreat back to the Cheat Mountain camps. The 9th participated in building the Union fortification at the summit of Cheat Mountain during the winter of 1861, according to Bierce, who said the following about this after a visit in 1909: \\"Here we slew the forest and builded us giant habitations (astride the road from Nowhere to the southeast) commodious to lodge and army and fitly loopholed for discomfiture of the adversary. The long logs that it was our pride to cut and carry! The accuracy with which we laid them one upon another, hewn to the line and bulletproof. The Cyclopean doors that we hung, with sliding blots fit to be the 'mast of some great admiral!' And when we had 'made the pile complete' some marplot of the Regular Army came that way and chatted a few moments with our commander, and we made an earthwork away off on one side of the road (leaving the other side to take care of itself) and camped outside it in tents! But the Regular Army fellow had not the heart to suggest the demolition of our Towers of Babel, and the foundations remain to this day.\\"Bierce, p. 75, and , citing Dyer  Battle of Shiloh  April 6–7, 1862. The Department of the Ohio was converted to the Army of the Ohio in March 1862. Don Carlos Buell led this Army until he was relieved of command after the Battle of Perryville in October 1862. The Shiloh Union order of battle indicates that the 9th was a part of William \\"Bull\\" Nelson's Fourth Division and William B. Hazen's 19th Brigade after the conversion. Three of Buell's divisions—Nelson's, Thomas L. Crittenden's and Alexander M. McCook's—arrived on the evening of April 6 to reinforce Ulysses S. Grant's Army of West Tennessee, which happened to be located on the west bank of the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, during the battle. Under fire, two small steamers ferried Buell's 30,000 troops across the Tennessee to Pittsburg Landing.See Battle of Shiloh, Shiloh Union order of battle, Ketchum, pp. 125-126, and Bierce, p. 96. Bierce described what the 9th saw of Pittsburg Landing that evening in vivid detail in \\"What I Saw of Shiloh.\\" After an exhausting march from the village of Savannah, Tennessee, through swamps and jungle to the banks of the Tennessee opposite the landing, the 9th waited to be ferried across to the western side. Once on a steamer riding precariously low in the water under the weight of the troops, the 9th had a closer view of two Union gunboats, the Lexington and the Tyler. These gunboats had taken advantage of the high river bank and the opportune location of the mouth of a bayou to lob shells at the enemy from a protected vantage point on the river, effectively silencing Confederate small arms fire as much as a mile away. After debarking, the 9th passed through the chaos and carnage evident from the first day's battle. They pushed past fearful soldiers who were trying to escape by boarding the steamers for the trip back to the east bank. Men with bayonets kept those attempting to flee off the boats, and if not initially successful, subsequently threw them into the water.Bierce, pp. 96-99 and Ketchum, pp. 125-126. During the night of April 6 and the early morning of the 7th, Buell positioned Nelson's division closest to the river of all the troops under his command. By the time daylight came, Buell had directed Nelson to advance toward William J. Hardee's corps. Assuming the enemy had retreated all the way to Corinth, Bierce's platoon at one point advanced up an incline over open ground to strengthen the skirmish line, only to discover that Confederate forces in the woods on the far side had been waiting quietly to open fire upon them. Once they did, \\"a dozen of my brave fellows tumbled over like tenpins.\\" Bierce's platoon made a retreat back across the field to rejoin the rest of the regiment.Battle of Shiloh and Bierce, p. 104. The 9th spent the remainder of the battle positioned behind the Union guns (at first lying face down, trying to avoid being killed by the enemy's own artillery) and countering the flanking movements of several succeeding lines of Confederate infantry, which eventually retreated when Union reinforcements arrived.Bierce, pp. 105-109.  Siege of Corinth  April 29-May 30, 1862  Battle of Perryville  October 8, 1862  Battle of Stones River  December 30–31, 1862, and January 1–3, 1863. On December 31, the 9th as part of Hazen's brigade defended the left flank of the Union line at Round Wood, now known as \\"Hell's Half Acre\\" because of the intensity of the battle at this location. Hazen's forces were the only part of the original line to hold, despite a number of attacks by Breckenridge's division and reinforcements from Polk's corps. 113 men from the 9th were killed or wounded during this battle.Battle of Stones River and Duncan and Klooster, p. 90.  Battle of Chickamauga  September 19–20, 1863. Colonel Isaac C.B. Suman's official report described the 9th's activities before and during this battle.War of the Rebellion, Series 1 - Volume 30 (Part I), pp. 767-770.

(1879) 'The Salting Mounds of Essex' in Archaeological Journal XXXVI Originally Stopes thought that the mounds were Medieval in date, and were used for producing alkalis for glass making. However other investigations, such as that by John Christopher Atkinson, who compared them to similar mounds in Yorkshire, saw the mounds as prehistoric or Roman in date. In 1906 the Essex Archaeological Society and Essex Field Club created the Red Hills Exploration Committee to identify the purpose, age and extent of the Red Hills, undertaking excavations at Langenhoe and Goldhanger, and later in 1909 at Canewdon on the River Crouch.Reader, F.W.

However some early comparisons to salt-processing sites in Brittany in the early Twentieth century lead to tentative suggestions that salt was at the heart of the Red Hills' purpose,Wilmer, H. (1908). 'Late Celtic remains of the coast of Brittany comparable to the Red Hills' in Reader, F.W. (1908) 'Report of the Red Hills Exploration Committee 1906-7'. Proceedings of the Society of Antiquities XXII, 2nd Series with further excavations in Britain of sites similar to the Red Hills of Essex and East Anglia at Ingoldmells in Lincolnshire and Hook in Hampshire choosing this interpretation over the alkali explanation. Ernest Linder's 1937–1941 excavations of Red Hills at Canvey Island in South Essex began to draw upon salt-making as the main suggestion for what had been occurring at these mounds.Linder, E. (1939) 'The Red Hills of Canvey Island' in Essex Naturalist XXV1, III During the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s further excavations were carried out around Southend-on-SeaHelliwell, L. (1960) 'Finds, Accessions and Fieldwork 1955–59', Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society XXV Pt.3 and Canvey Island in South Essex, around the Dengie peninsula and Maldon in central Essex, and around Harwich and the Blackwater and Colne estuaries in North-East Essex. Red Hills and salt making at Salthouse (Norfolk) were also described by Hoskins.WG Hoskins, Fieldwork in Local History, (Faber & Faber Ltd. 1967, pp. 154–158) During these investigations much information was gathered both on the date and purpose of the Red Hills. Description and purpose Description Over 300 Red Hills have been identified so far, mostly along the Essex and Norfolk coasts, with others in Suffolk and Kent. The vast majority of Red Hills are located on low-lying coastal flats in tidal estuaries and in back-waters like Hamford Water between Harwich and Walton-on- the-Naze in Essex. They take the form of low mounds, ranging in size from about 200 square metres (equivalent to a 16m diameter circle) to a hectare (equiv. to a 115m diameter circle). William Stopes identified one on Mersea Island near the Strood Channel which was 30 acres in size, but acknowledged that it may have consisted of more than one mound. The height of many mounds has been much truncated by ploughing, with others located close to rivers and the sea either being eroded away or covered with alluvial silt, but an average sized mound at Peldon in Essex, 0.2 acres in size, still stands at a height of roughly 1.3m (meaning a volume of about 1000 cu metres, equivalent to 1500 tons of earth). The strata of the mounds is made up of tips of briquetage (broken fragments of fired clay from hearths, evaporation pans and other salt- making furniture which give the mound its red colouration), ash, charcoal and unfired clay.Lesley & Roy Adkins, The Handbook of British Archeology Most have large pits cut into the ground around them that have been lined with clay to produce a water-tight tank. Features Several structures relating to salt production are found at Red Hills, whose purpose in the process is inferred from archaeological analysis and from analogies to Medieval and more recent techniques for obtaining sea salt. =Settling tanks= Rows of oval clay- lined pits dug into the alluvium around the Red Hills are interpreted as tanks for holding sea water. These tanks are usually in groups, with those found at Red Hills at Goldhanger,de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘The Excavations of a Red Hill at Peldon, Essex, with notes on some other sites’ Antiquities Journal LVIII pt.1 Maldon, and at Leigh Beck at Canvey Islandde Brisay, K.W. (1972) Preliminary Report on the Exploration of the Red Hill at Osea Road, Maldon, Essex. Published by Colchester Archaeological Group Annual Bulletin 15 consisting of groups of three. Most tanks are between 1 and 2m in diameter, and around 1m deep, with a potential holding capacity of over 1000 litres. =Hearths= In situ hearths are relatively rare at Red Hill sites. Parts of hearth substructures were found at the Red Hills on Osea Road near Maldon and at Tollesbury in Essex,de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘A Red Hill at Tollesbury, Essex: Its background and excavation. Report on the First Year’ Published in Colchester Archaeological Group Bulletin 21 whilst the first identifiable hearth was found at Peldon close to the central settling tank in a group of three. This consisted of a subrectangular 1.8m x 0.8m clay walled structure, surviving to 0.4m high, with evidence of multiple firings. Other hearths containing Roman tile have been found at Leigh Beck on Canvey Island, and others have been located at Red Hills along Fenn Creek near South Woodham Ferrers. =Flues= Flue ducts for directing hot gas from fires to heat chambers have been found at some sites, but are very rare. At the Goldhanger VIII Red Hill nine flues and two fire-floors on top of the Red Hill mound, suggesting that they post-date most of the activity on the site. =Briquetage= Briquetage refers to the broken fragments of clay structures found in great quantities at Red Hill sites. Much of this material is locally made and of a crude quality, suggesting that it was expedient. Although some of the clay appears to have been fired in a kiln, much of it is bonfire-made. The redness of the material is created during its use, as the iron oxide content of the clay is converted to red iron ferric oxide in an atmosphere containing a surplus of oxygen. Some briquetage has lost its red colouration during its use as part of the salt evaporation furniture, turning grey, purple or brown. 90 per cent of briquetage consists of flat faced rectangular slabs of varying sizes, which can be reconstructed into large, rectangular clay vessels and trays. Some examples from Langenhoe and Peldon have decorated rims. Other examples of briquetage include pedestals and T-shapes, believed to have held the rectangular clay vessels above fires, triangular fire-bars 20–40 cm in size that may suspended vessels above fires, triangular or plectrum-shaped wedges and long clay rods of unknown purposes, and pinch-props, small lumps of briquetage that have a flat base and at least one other facet, possibly used to mend clay vessels. Purpose The interpretation of these features as salt-making sites comes from the discovery of these features and artefacts associated with them. The briquetage and signs of burning at all Red Hills are taken as evidence that intensive use of fires took place on the sites. Red Hills are found in close proximity to sources of salt water, and since Red Hills have clay-lined tanks for holding liquids associated with them, this is seen as an important fluid used in the activities which took place at the mounds. The charcoal, red-scorching, and fired clay briquetage is seen as evidence that fires and heating took place at the mounds, and so, since some of the briquetage has traces of green-glaze on its surfaces caused by the vitrification of clay with salt acting as a fluxing agent, the suggestion that salt water, stored in the water-tight tanks, was being heated in clay trays to obtain salt as the end product is seen as the most likely purpose of the Red Hills. Other industrial activities such as pottery making and metal working are seen as less likely due to the lack of any supporting evidence for such processes. Function Red Hills are located on low-lying land close to marshes, estuaries and tidal bays, with rivers such as the Crouch and Roach, which have low freshwater outflows, having Red Hills far inland along their tidal estuaries. Use of the Red Hill sites is believed to have been seasonal, with activity occurring from Spring until the end of Summer. The drier conditions of Spring allow for the construction of the clay structures for the season (which if constructed in damp conditions would have cracked when fired), and the collection of fire-wood. Analysis of the charred remains of fire-wood from Red Hills sites suggests that coppiced wood was used in the fires at the site, an activity that in itself required careful management over time. Sea-water may have been collected in tidally-fed sun pans cut into tidal channels to allow for solar evaporation in the initial stages of the process, although no such features have been positively identified. Instead, sea water seems to have been collected in the clay-lined settling tanks, which were submerged by the high-tide or were filled manually when the tide was lower. The depth of these tanks suggests that they were designed to allow the alluvial mud and other unwanted solids in the water to settle to the bottom, to be emptied out later. As this settling procedure could take several hours, having more than one tank allowed for them to be at different stages of the settling process, meaning that salt making could continue with little down-time. Sea-water contains around 3.5 per cent solids on average, 2.7 per cent being salt, with 96.5ccs of sea-water having to be evaporated in order to obtain 2.7 g of salt. This would have been done by transferring water from the tanks to large rectangular trays suspended over fires that would have evaporated off the water. For the first batch of water the tray would have been filled before the fire was lit, to reduce the risk of cracking, after which water would have been constantly added from the tanks whilst salt crystals would have been constantly ladled out. Lime and gypsum hard-scale would form first, as pan-scale at the base of the trays. Then, as the salt content in the trays rose from 2.7 per cent to 28 it would start to form crystals in the boiling water (meaning that 90ccs out of an original 100ccs of water would have needed to evaporate before salt crystals form). Removing crystals before all of the water had evaporated from the tray was the intention, as it meant that impurities would have been left in the tray and the process could be continued all day without having to close the evaporation process down whilst salt was collected. In theory the tray vessel could have been topped up with water roughly one hundred times before the concentration of the bittern impurities and pan-scale left behind became too high. The salt crystals ladled out of the trays would have been placed in drying vessels and baskets close to a source of heat. From this \\"salt cakes\\" would be created, ready for transportation.

It opened Off-Broadway on October 11, 1995 at the Players Theatre. The show examines American ideals and foibles during the era of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a tone that is often parodistic and sometimes genuinely satiric, all following closely the structural form of grade-B space paranoia films that were popular during the 1950s. History Zombies from The Beyond opened to virtually unanimous acclaim from the New York and out of town critics in October 1995 and appeared poised to become a sleeper success. Often commented upon was the deadpan performing style of the material, which seemed to heighten the humor by playing against camp values, and the surprising score which was not rock and roll, but rather an homage to the adult pop sounds of the 1950s such as Perry Como, Patti Page, and Doris Day. Despite the enthusiastic critical response, the show faced severe competition from several high-powered star vehicles that opened within two weeks of its own opening, and the out-of-the-way location of its theatre was another drawback. By Christmas the show had closed. Shortly thereafter, the show was published by Dramatists Play Service and the cast album was released on Original Cast Records. Zombies from The Beyond has been produced in cities including Chicago, Houston, St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, and Minneapolis. Regional, stock, and university productions continue to be done every year. Some notable productions include The Blowing Rock Stage in North Carolina (1997), which featured original cast members Claire Morkin, Matt McClanahan, and Jeremy Czarniak directed by author James Valcq, and the Philadelphia production at Society Hill Playhouse (1997), also directed by Valcq. Synopsis ;Act I It's 1955. Ike is president, the economy is booming, and \\"The Sky's the Limit\\" at the Milwaukee Space Center. Staunch Major Malone (originally played by Michael Shelle), his aide Rick Jones (originally played by Robert Boles), secretary Charlene \\"Charlie\\" Osmanski (originally played by Suzanne Graff), Deli delivery boy Billy Krutzik (originally played by Jeremy Czarniak), and the Major's unnervingly competent daughter Mary (originally played by Claire Morkin) are all abuzz at the arrival of rocket scientist Trenton Corbett (originally played by Matt McClanahan) to the Probe Seven Control Room. Via the Probe's space photography equipment, the crew makes an alarming discovery on the television monitor screen: \\"A Flying Saucer\\". Later at the Orbit Room Cocktail Lounge, Rick and Mary dauntlessly dance away the imminent danger (\\"The Rocket-Roll\\"). Trenton arrives just in time to hear the saucer buzzing the Galaxy of Coiffures Beauty Salon across the street. After impetuous Rick rushes off to investigate, Trenton attempts to calm the fears of the usually intrepid Mary (\\"Second Planet on the Right\\"). Back in the Control Room, a top-secret scheme is hatched to launch a manned rocket into battle with the hovering spacemobile. Charlie is inducted to measure up the men for suitable spacewear (\\"Blast Off Baby\\"). Billy pesters Charlie for a date, quick, before aliens conquer the city. He taps his way into her heart with his \\"Atomic Feet\\" and they plan to rendezvous later that night. When the brazen saucer actually lands in the beauty salon, it's \\"all systems go\\" for new emergency procedures: Trenton will develop a weapon of mass destruction, Rick will set up a blockade at the beauty shop, and poor Charlie will man the television monitor. Shifty Rick now reveals his true color – (red!) – as he retrieves orders via mysterious walkie-talkie to slip Charlie a mickey and make contact with the invaders for the greater glory of his homeland (\\"Big Wig\\"). In Mary's car, Trenton – sworn to secrecy – breaks Mary's heart when he breaks their date (\\"In the Stars\\"). Meanwhile, at the Galaxy of Coiffures, Rick encounters Zombina (originally played by Susan Gottschalk), a buxom alien aviatrix bent on procuring he-specimens to play stud on her female-laden planet. Employing her supersonic \\"Secret Weapon\\" (a soprano voice so stratospheric that it zombifies), Zombina transforms Rick into a bug-eyed slave to her nefarious demands. She and her entourage of titillatingly tacky \\"Zombettes\\" (originally played by the rest of the cast, decked out in intentionally unconvincing 'disguises') sound the shrill soprano war-cry of \\"Zombies from The Beyond\\". ;Act II Zombina's tirade of terror has the city on pins and needles (\\"Dateline: Milwaukee\\"), yet Trenton and Mary are able to terminate their tiff (\\"Second Planet Reprise\\"). Our heroes plan to implement Trenton's newly developed 'amplificator' against subversive enemies, singing gaily: \\"Don't just hate 'em, exterminate 'em, that's \\"The American Way!\\" Charlie emerges from her stupor and a series of spine-tingling clues leads the probe crew to a cataclysmic conclusion about Rick ('I Am a Zombie\\"). Zombina herself appears on the television monitor screen and proceeds to zombify Trenton and Malone in an amazing 3-D \\"broad\\"-cast. Can Mary and Charlie save Milwaukee from this menace? Zombina, fed up with Rick's inability to perform up to her high standards, resolves to employ her considerable wiles in perpetrating her perverse ploys (\\"The Last Man on Earth\\"). Running amuck in historical downtown Milwaukee, she plays demolition derby with her stratocruiser and does away with Rick once and for all. In the chilling climax high atop the Wisconsin Gas Company Building, Mary and Charlie battle it out with Zombina (\\"Breaking the Sound Barrier\\"), pitting their brash belting voices against Zombina's coloratura quavers. All appears lost until good old Billy arrives and joins forces with the girls by adding his Geiger-counter tap-dancing to their raucous roundelay, resulting in the hideous demise of Zombina whose formerly formidable voice drops a couple octaves (She bewails: \\"What a world! I'm belting!\\") Malone and Trenton are de-zombified, and Milwaukee – (what's left of it) – is saved! Stalwart Major Malone leads the survivors in a stirring hymn of patriotic paranoia, advising everyone, everywhere to \\"Keep Watching the Skies\\". Critical reception \\"Dead aim, deadpan, dead-on new musical! With keen-eyed skill to spare, it manages to spoof everything that characterized the old science-fiction B-movies, from cheesy spaceships (with visible wires and erratic flight paths that send them bumping into the sets) to cheap weaponry (an 'amplificator' whose base is an Electrolux vacuum cleaner), stilted language ('apprehensive'), Cold War paranoia, condescension toward women and utter conviction in the infallibility of the United States.\\"Lawrence Van Gelder, The New York Times, November 9, 1995 \\"A splendid surprise! This crazy satire is absolutely enchanting. The book is deliciously silly, while the music and lyrics are sveltely appropriate to subject matter and treatment. The music ranges from Doris Day/Perry Como style romanticism, to Neolithic rock and dewy doo-wop. And there is even one number, \\"The American Way,\\" that might have been penned by that half-savage Harvard 1950s satirist, Tom Lehrer, with its comment aimed at our nation's enemies: 'Don't just hate 'em, exterminate 'em.' By all means see it - - it's 24-carat fun!\\"Clive Barnes, New York Post, December 1, 1995 \\"Hilarious! Superb! Marvelous! Out of this world! A droll, tongue-in-cheek book and a zippy score. The plot may be silly, but when was the last time you heard a line with the literary overtones of 'Never again will the stars glitter anonymously in the fabric of night like so many sequins on a drape'? A dizzy musical above and beyond the call of hilarity!\\"Howard Kissell, The Daily News \\"Takes an irreverent look at America's naïve fascination with space exploration and all the Cold War paranoia that went with it. The songs are funny.\\"The New Yorker, November 20, 1995 \\"James Valcq's book and songs are 10 times cleverer than anything on Broadway right now! The audience is sent into seventh satire heaven. This is a scream, hoot, and holler from A to Z and will probably turn up on many theatres' rosters thanks to its small set and cast.

A porter's chair was a type of chair used in medieval England and later France. Usually formed in a high-grade leather or red velvet, it was placed by the front door of an estate or home for use by a gatekeeper servant who was in charge of screening guests and visitors. This was necessary since the door knocker might not be heard throughout the house. Since there were often cold breezes near a front door, the chair was designed to envelop and keep the servant relatively warm in his task of remaining at the door for long periods.

Harvard Dictionary of Music, p.347. Harvard. . was an Irish musician, and was the inventor of the glass harp (also known as the \\"Angelic organ\\") in 1741. Life He was born at his family's estate Derrylusk at Aghnamallagh, County Monaghan, Ireland. His father, also named Richard (c.1666–1719), was the member of Parliament for Monaghan and had commanded troops in the Williamite battles. The paternal descent was of an English family from Surrey. Some notices indicate that Poekrich was the name of the family, and this was the spelling he gave on his works. He is reported to have been aged 25 when his father died (1720?), so a probable year of birth has been fixed to 1695. Poekrich received a substantial inheritance, valued at a figure between £1,000 (Newburgh) and £4,000 (Pilkington). Variations of his name include Puckeridge or Pokeridge, or styled as 'Captain Poekrich' in contemporary notices. His unsuccessful ventures included a brewery in Dublin, near Islandbridge, the tale of its decline is intertwined with that of his greatest success, his musical glasses. When bailiffs came to arrest Poekrich for his debts, he entranced them with an impromptu performance on his 'angelick organ'; his subsequent pardon is given as the earliest example of a belief in the psychological effect of the instrument, later adopted by Mesmer. Another proposal was raising geese on barren terrain of his purchases in County Wicklow. Other schemes included an observatory to pursue his interest in astrology. His imagination extended to an orchestra of various sized drums, arranged to be played by one person. His political involvement included lobbying the Parliament of Ireland for planting vineyards by draining the Irish bogs. He also proposed the development of metal hulled ships, some 100 years before their eventual introduction, carrying lifeboats made of tin. Despite his grand platform for election, he failed to win when he ran for Parliament (twice, 1745 Monaghan and 1749 Dublin). An enthusiast of blood transfusion, he believed that disease could be cured and life extended by the use of healthy donors. A description of the procedure proposes the use of servants or other physically active specimens. Anticipating the problems of immortality that might result, Pockrich proposed that an act decreeing that \\"anyone attaining the age of 999 years shall be deemed ... dead in law\\".Newburgh, cited at British Medical journal, 1967 Numerous other proposals were issued from the visionary, amongst these was a plan to link the River Liffey and River Shannon by a series of canals. Descriptions of his schemes might be seen as exaggeration or distortion by their dubious authorities, but records of advertisements placed by Poekrich support the number of unrealised proposals. He also failed in his application to become Master of the Choristers of Armagh Cathedral.Zeitler cites Flood Unmarried until he was 50, Margaret White became his wife in 1745. She sailed from England with the actor Theophilus Cibber, apparently eloping and fleeing debt, and died in a shipwreck on the Scottish coast in 1758. He toured England with his musical glasses since about 1756; while staying in London in 1759, he died in a fire. Works Pockrich eventually found success with his performances of his musical glasses and is credited with their invention in 1741; he named the instrument an \\"angelic organ\\". His decrepit rooms were given over to development of his design and performance of it. His early method of playing, using wooden sticks, is comparable to a similar instrument, the 'glassspiel' or 'verrillon', designed a few years earlier on known principles. His 'virtuoso' performances, accompanied by a singer, received good notices, and reported to have been a popular act. He toured around England and Ireland. His repertoire included works by Handel. The technique he used involved stroking the glass with sticks, but Franklin said he later switched to the 'wet-finger- around-the-wine-glass' method.Zeitler. \\"Benjamin Franklin. See his letter to Giovanni Battista Beccaria, July 1762.\\" One popular performance was \\"Tell me, lovely Shepherd\\", sung by a Miss Young. He published a collection of poetry, his Miscellaneous Works appearing in 1750. The instrument was adopted by Gluck, who presented it on 23 April 1746 as \\"a concerto on 26 drinking-glasses tuned with Spring water\\", and performances were popular for half a century. His pupils continued after the death of the originator, a performance in 1760 by one Anne Ford is mentioned in a short notice by Flood. Forde wrote an instruction manual and toured Europe and England. Pilkington gave a description of Pockrich constructing an instrument, simulating a dulcimer, during a meeting at his home; by hammering pins and wire on the table, the visitor laid his head to hear his request for Black Joke. Legacy Poekrich is best remembered for the popularisation of musical glasses, via his promotion and influence, that he discovered in the later years of his life. Descriptions of his character — as a proposer of \\"wild\\" schemes — range from sympathetic views as 'quixotic' to those of an \\"enterprising scoundrel\\". The earliest biographical notices began with David O'Donoghue, a brief notice in his dictionary Poets of Ireland (1891–93), and the same author's longer notice was in the Dictionary of National Biography, 1900, these being the first two references on the inventor and his works. O'Donoghue notes the autobiographical Memoirs of John Carteret Pilkington and also draws on the miscellaneous collection Essays, Poetical, Moral, &c.;, 1769, by Thomas Newburgh (c.1695–1779), attributing the relevant material to his father Brockhill Newburgh writing in 1743, and the early or contemporary sources in Thomas Campbell's Philosophical Survey; Conran's National Music of Ireland; the Gentleman's Magazine 1759; and his own reference work, Poets of Ireland. Campbell in a notice in A Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland (1776), in asserting Poekrich's eminence in music, stated that performances of his instrument, while lacking great force, produced the sweetest of tones. The article appeared as the last in volume 15 of the DNB, a bibliographic quibble notes that 'Poekrich' is the correct spelling and it should have been included in the next. The brief notice given there suggests a detail on his death, > \\"in 1759 in a fire which broke out in his room at Hamlin's Coffee-house, > Sweeting's Alley, near the Royal Exchange, London.\\" [emph. added] O'Donoghue expanded his work to a longer article, published as \\"An Irish Musical Genius\\". Like other early biographers, who repeated references in the few contemporary source, the publications of their subject were largely ignored and depended on questionable views. Pilkington, the son of Laetitia Pilkington, sang during Pockrich's show and was apparently intimate during his youth, but gives no later information of him. Pilkington gives does give a later mention to \\"Captain Poekrich, the glass projector,\\" in his memoirs, grudgingly admitting to his value as a performer when his listener recognised him and agreed to request a concert. No reply was received, due to his unfortunate demise around the time. Brockhill Newburgh of Co. Cavan was related to Pockrich, apparently making him the subject of a mocking poem, 'The Projector', a first attempt at what would have been a 24 volume work entitled \\"The Pockreiad\\". The notes to this unfinished work detail the author's ridicule of his subject's notions, though he gives exception to his highly regarded musical glasses; this became a key source of information on the life of Richard Pockrich. The elegiac text of Newburgh:Zeitler, (O'Donahue cit.

The Company has several businesses in its varied portfolio, including BP fuel card distributor Be Fuelcards;Be Fuelcards property development company Bayford Developments; holiday rentals portfolio, Decadent Retreats; and Shell fuel card agent The Right Fuelcard Company.  History  thumb right Bayford was founded in Leeds by four survivors of the First World War who decided to pool their resources to establish a coal agents business. Whilst searching for a suitable title for their enterprise, they hit on the idea of using the name of the Hertfordshire village of Bayford where they had been demobilized at the end of the war. They were joined by Frederick Turner as an office junior. He eventually rose to become the Company Chairman and remained so until the 1970s. The Bayford company maintained a steady growth in the solid fuel business in the first period of its life – successfully weathering difficult periods such as the General Strike, Second World War, and the nationalisation of the coal industry. The firm then diversified into the petrol and oil distribution business as coal declined. 1950s–1980s David Turner joined his father Frederick in the business in 1958 and in 1962 it was David Turner's decision to start selling oil, based on the view that as more and more people were turning from coal to oil for home heating, \\"one followed the customer or lost the business\\". In 1967 Bayford moved to new premises in Pepper Road, off Hunslet Road, Leeds and Bayford also began importing cargoes of oil from abroad via Immingham, to feed its Fleet storage facility and its tankers. This was a first for a UK independent company. In 1969 Bayford decided to market low price petrol. The name Thrust was inspired by news reports of Concorde’s maiden flight and the description of the \\"tremendous thrust\\" of its engines. The first petrol pump to carry the new sign, complete with the Concorde insignia, was in Ossett, West Yorkshire. Thrust rapidly built up to a chain of 45 outlets by the end of 1970 and 85 by 1972. In 1970 Bayford Developments started trading by purchasing investment properties in Biggin Hill and Mitchum in Surrey. By 1976 Bayford was delivering 100,000 tonnes of coal each week to Yorkshire's power stations, after striking an agreement with the CEGB (Central Electricity Generating Board). Bayford continued to supply significant quantities of coal into the 1990s, and during the 1980s were also supplying some 3 million litres of oil per day to the region's power stations. By 1979 the company's Fleet Storage depot by the Aire and Calder Canal in Leeds had an annual throughput of 150,000 tons of fuel per year. Bayford was still heavily involved in the coal market in the 1980s. At its peak, Bayford Mining was producing from sites in Yorkshire, Lancashire and in the North and East of Scotland. The average life of an opencast mine was around 18 months, after which time the land was restored to its former use. Growth in the 1990s and 2000s Bowcliffe Hall in Bramham, Wetherby – front view of the hall. In 1988 Bayford moved into new headquarters at Bowcliffe Hall in Bramham, West Yorkshire – a 19th-century listed building next to the Bramham Park Grounds. In the first of several acquisitions, Bayford took over Holderness Fuel Supplies Ltd in 1991. Holderness had a throughput of 35 million litres from three depots, in Leeds, Humberside and Malton, North Yorkshire. Bayford bought out British Fuel's share of the Fleet Storage facility at Woodlesford in 1993. Bayford acquired twenty-two Yorkshire filling stations from Elf Oil (UK) Ltd and seven petrol station sites in the North East from Texaco, which were operated under the Thrust Petroleum brand in 1994. Bayford acquired the commercial oil business, Burmah Petroleum Fuels Ltd in 1995. The move effectively tripled the size of Bayford's oil business and made it Britain's largest privately owned distributor of commercial oils. Jonathan Turner was appointed Managing Director of the \\"Bayford Group\\" in 2000. In 2001 Bayford gained the UK rights to the Gulf brand, in a deal with Gulf Oil International, and also launched a new business, (Gulf Lubricants UK Ltd.), in association with Gulf, to market and sell lubricants. The company became involved in a £47m deal to buy the 400-strong network of Save petrol stations, the largest independent petrol network in the UK. Bayford launched Countrywide Fuel Cards in partnership with BP in 2003, selling fuel cards through BP branded sites. Bayford also launched InterCity Fuel Cards in partnership with Shell, operating initially as separate businesses. In 2004 Jonathan Turner bought Bayford and Company Ltd. from family shareholders. Following the Fambo buy- out, Bayford acquired three new fuel card businesses, Central Fuel Cards, Truckhaven Ltd and Routemate Fuel Cards. This saw Bayford's fuel card business become the only company to have partnerships with the three biggest fuel brands in the UK, Esso, Shell and BP, as well as adding the most widely accepted diesel-bunkering card on the market, to its portfolio. By taking over three fuel card businesses and the two fuel distribution companies, Bayford earned itself the title of \\"Acquirer of the Year 2006\\" at the Business XL Magazine Company of the Year Awards. Following a year of record profits and sustained organic growth, in 2006 Bayford completed the acquisition of Askham Oil Supplies, one of the UK's leading authorised distributors for Texaco. Bayford's fuel distribution operations now extend from North Wales to the Lincolnshire coast, and right up to the Scottish border. A change of direction In 2007 Liz Slater was appointed Managing Director of Bayford & Company Ltd., with Jonathan Turner becoming the company's Chief Executive. In the same year Bayford ventured into the online arena with the launch of www.heatingoil.co.uk. The site allowed home heating oil users to get an instant quote, order oil and select their preferred delivery date at the click of a button. In its first year of trading heatingoil.co.uk sold more than 1 million litres of home heating oil to customers across the UK. In 2007 Bayford & Co Ltd sold The Fuelcard Company to US-based card operator Fleetcor. Bayford retained its Truckhaven and Countrywide Fuelcards business as an official distributor of BP fuel cards. In June 2008 Truckhaven and Countrywide Fuelcards were brought together under one brand, Be Fuelcards. In 2009 Jonathan Turner took the decision to sell Bayford Oil, heatingoil.co.uk and Gulf to GB Oils, a DCC company. Following the sale to GB Oils, the Bayford Group retained Be Fuelcards, Bayford Properties and Bayford Developments. In 2010 Bayford launched Decadent Retreats, a company letting luxury holiday accommodation. The properties include the 13,000 acre Laudale Estate, an exceptional Scottish Estate located on the shores of picturesque Loch Sunart available to let for exclusive use, 6 self-catering cottages located within the Laudale Estate and a luxury villa located in La Manga Club, Spain. 2011 saw the launch of several new ventures for the Bayford company. The Right Fuelcard Company was established in Hunslet, Leeds as an independent agent selling exclusively the Shell fuel card. In the same year Rontec Investments LLP, a consortium led by Snax 24, purchased assets from Total including 810 retail sites. Immediately, following the acquisition, 254 of these retail sites were sold to Shell UK for £240 million. In the deal The Right Fuelcard Company, part of the Bayford Group and a partner in the Rontec consortium, acquired Total's fuel card customers. Shell agreed that The Right Fuelcard Company could market the joint branded fuel card. Early in 2012 existing Total card holders will receive a new dual-branded card enabling them to draw fuel from either Total or Shell sites. Over time, company-owned Total sites will be rebranded as Shell. In respect of dealer owned sites, the decision as to which brand to go with will be theirs. In the same year Jaytee Ripon LLP was set up and submitted an application to build a motorway service area on the A1 near Ripon. Bayford Properties also embarked on a building project to add a block of 14 apartments a few miles further north, in Northallerton. These were completed in 2012. 2014 saw the completion of a multi-phase refurbishment and development of Bayford Group HQ, Bowcliffe Hall near Wetherby, West Yorkshire. The brainchild of CEO Jonathan Turner, the £6 million development saw the creation of a multi award-winning 2,000 square foot treehouse conference and events venue built in the shape of an airplane wing, the Blackburn Wing, the conversion of redundant buildings into office space and the creation of a private members' club, the Bowcliffe Drivers' Club. 2015 saw further re- development at Bayford Group HQ with the restoration of Bowcliffe Hall's original Drawing Room into a magnificent and opulent events venue, the Ballroom. In 2017, the Bayford Group acquired the licence to set up Gulf Gas & Power for the UK and the Netherlands, selling great value gas and electricity to homes and businesses. The Gulf name has been established for over 117 years and is synonymous with great service in a range of products and services from petrol stations to motorsports and now energy. 2017 also saw the purchase of The Yorke Arms, a Michelin starred restaurant with rooms located in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales. A sensitive refurbishment programme carried out in early 2018 saw the creation of 18 luxurious individually styled bedrooms and suites, each reflecting something great about Yorkshire's heritage, whilst the restaurants, lounge and bar were also refurbished, each reflecting the muted colours of the spectacular scenery surrounding The Yorke Arms. Today the Bayford Group remains a diverse holding company with interests in energy, fuel cards, property investment, development and letting, hospitality, events and e-commerce.

Additional members are from Canada and over twenty-five other countries around the world including: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Driven by its mission statement and Code of Ethics, NATS offers a variety of lifelong learning experiences to its members, such as workshops, intern programs, master classes, and conferences, all beginning at the local chapter level and progressing to state, regional, and national events. NATS also supports the growth and enrichment of its members through the publication of the Journal of Singing, a scholarly journal with articles on all aspects of singing and the teaching of singing, written by distinguished scholars in their fields. Originally titled the NATS Bulletin, it has been published since the formation of the organization in 1944.Shepard, p. 324 History NATS was founded in 1944 in Cincinnati, Ohio.Shepard, p. 324. As an outgrowth of the development of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) in the early years of the twentieth century, a group of singing teachers incorporated the association in the state of New York on November 27, 1906.Ringel, p. 1 The first annual meeting of the new organization was held on January 7, 1908 at Steinway Hall in New York City.Ringel, p. 2 In 1917 it changed its name to the New York Singing Teachers' Association (NYSTA).Ringel, p. 2 In 1922 the Los Angeles Guild of Teachers of Singing was chartered, and two years later it published a Code of Ethics that was later embraced by the national organization.Ringel, p. 3 The Chicago Council of Teachers of Singing was organized in 1930. These local organizations began the process of becoming a national organization in the early 1940s. During the 1944 MTNA Convention, members of the various groups met on Thursday, March 23, 1944, at the Netherland Plaza Hotel in Cincinnati to create the National Association of Teachers of Singing.Ringel, p. 11 More recent historical highlights are given on the organization's web site.Section \\"Who is NATS?\\" www.nats.org Organization The association has a national office in Jacksonville, Florida, and is governed by a national Board of Directors.Names of current board members is listed on the NATS web site, www.nats.org Members belong to one of 14 national Regions, depending upon which state they reside in: * Cal-Western Region * Central Region * Eastern Region * Great Lakes Region * Intermountain Region * Mid-Atlantic Region * Mid-South Region * New England Region * North Central Region * Northwestern Region * Southeastern Region * Southern Region * Texoma Region * West Central Region A Regional Governor serves as the head of each national region. Individual states and localities also have independent chapters, with State Governors and chapter presidents leading them.

They also have the opportunity, along with members, to compete at a national level through the National Association of Teachers of Singing Artist Awards (NATSAA). The national Artist Award program began in 1955 as the Singer of the Year Scholarship Auditions.Shepard, p. 324 The NATSAA competition is designed to assist singers prepared to launch a professional career, and to that end substantial monetary and performance prizes are offered. The competition takes place every other year, in conjunction with NATS Conferences. Preliminary competitions are held regionally, and semifinals/finals take place at the NATS Conference. Throughout its history the purpose of this [NATSAA] competition has been to select, through a series of elimination rounds on the district, regional, and national levels, singers whose artistry indicates that they are ready for a professional career and to encourage them toward that goal with a cash prize and the opportunity for performance engagements.

It has a fragrance reminiscent of lily of the valley, otherwise described as floral, watery, green and aldehydic. It is a pale yellow liquid at room temperature. It is toxic if swallowed and can cause skin irritation and sensitisation on contact. Recently it was found that in vitro, bourgeonal acts as a chemo-attractant for human spermatozoa, activating an olfactory receptor called OR1D2 (formerly called hOR17-4) which opens calcium ion channels in the sperm, leading them to swim twice as fast. Bourgeonal is suspected to be involved in helping sperm locate the ovum. As of 2010, bourgeonal is the only known odor substance to which males have a higher average sensitivity than females. This is thought to be because the same olfactory receptor (OR1D2) is expressed in non-olfactory tissue in sperm cells as well as the olfactory tissue of the nose. The involvement with sperm chemotaxis causes an evolutionary pressure for males (sexual selection) that causes them to have more OR1D2 receptors on average, both in the nose as well as in sperm.

A safe Labour seat, it was won by Geoffrey Robinson, who retained the seat until 2019. Party performance The by-election represented the first outing for the National Party; it had recently split from the National Front and both parties ran candidates in the election. Although both polled poorly, it set a trend for a split far right vote which was replicated in the 1989 Vauxhall by- election and elsewhere.

It is preserved at Darlington Railway Centre and Museum, now known as Head of Steam. Design Derwent was designed by Timothy Hackworth and built by W. & A. Kitching in Darlington, England in 1845. It is similar in design to two of their 1842 locomotives, Leader and Trader, with outside cylinders fixed at the trailing end of the boiler and four-foot diameter, six-wheeled coupled wheels. Withdrawn from service in 1869, it was sold to Pease & Partners for use on their colliery lines and spent some time at the construction of the Waskerley Reservoir in County Durham. It took part in the Stephenson Centenary celebrations at Newcastle in 1881 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 1887. Preservation Derwent was presented to the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1898 for preservation. After restoration the locomotive ran under its own steam in the 1925 Railway Centenary procession and on trials the day before the procession, achieved a speed of 12 m.p.h. Otherwise for many years it was on display alongside Locomotion No 1 on a plinth on one of the platforms at Darlington's main station, Bank Top. In the 1960s, it was removed and restored in near original condition, and then moved in the 1970s to the Darlington Railway Centre and Museum located in the same building as Darlington's North Road railway station, where it remains on display on long-term loan from the National Railway Museum. It is now part of the National Collection.

It was released in Australia on 16 June 2007; in the United Kingdom, it was released digitally on 18 June 2007 and physically on 25 June 2007. Background \\"Don't Stop Now\\" was written by Neil Finn shortly after he and his wife, Sharon Finn, moved to Freshford near Bath, England. The influence of the song came as a result of Finn's wife driving and having difficulty navigating due to her vehicle's GPS system providing incorrect information. To compound her difficulty, this was her first time driving in this area of England, an area known for its narrow roads.Neil Finn, Radio New Zealand interview with Neil Finn, recorded 19 May 2007. Retrieved 21 August 2007. The song was written by Crowded House frontman Neil Finn as a solo effort. The song features guitar work from alternative group The Smiths' former co-songwriter Johnny Marr. The song was originally destined for Finn's third solo album, but as his third album was converted into the new album for his band Crowded House, the song was released as a Crowded House offering. \\"Don't Stop Now\\" is one of only four from the fourteen tracks from Time on Earth that includes the full lineup of Finn, bassist Nick Seymour, guitarist/keyboardist Mark Hart and newcomer drummer Matt Sherrod as Crowded House. Cover art The cover art of \\"Don't Stop Now\\" is all in the same vein as the album Time on Earth that the song is derived from. This is prominent in that the artwork is made up of newspaper clippings that've been painted to fit the design, in this case appearing to be a green labyrinth with a car and some birds. The difference with this cover is that the song title is hand drawn, where on the album cover, the album title is in newspaper also. The blue dragon from the cover of Time on Earth is also seen hiding within the maze. The music video for \\"Don't Stop Now\\" also employs the same artwork and design as the background for the band. Notable performances As the lead single for the group's reunion album Time on Earth, Crowded House has performed \\"Don't Stop Now\\" at all of their performances since reuniting, including the international event Live Earth on 7 July 2007 and for a promotional performance on the Australian television program Rove on 8 July 2007. Music video The music video for \\"Don't Stop Now\\" is primarily animated with the band blue screened in. It features the same design and corporate image of the cover of its single and the album Time on Earth. The song is performed by the band who appear to be surrounded by illustrated trees and appear to be in an illustrated and animated world. Later, the band appears at the top of an illustrated newspaper building. The music video features a blue dragon (as from the Time on Earth cover) seeking out and devouring a person, just as from the album cover. The dragon is later featured throughout the music video. In parts of the music video, the shot moves to a close up view of newspaper, as is used on the cover of the album, while a small red car drives along the text and the words being sung are expanded to be read. As it is the first single with drummer Matt Sherrod on drums, it's also the first music video with Crowded House that he has been featured in. Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart is mostly seen on guitar while the band is in view, however is also shown playing piano in other scenes.Red Alternative, \\"Don't Stop Now\\" on YouTube.

His Trento Tunnels project — a 6000 sq. meter pair of superhighway tunnels at the entrance to the Northern Italian city of Trent, repurposed as an experimental history museum, has undergone several editions since 2008: among them, \\"I Trentini e la Grande Guerra (Il popolo scomparso/la sua storia ritrovata)\\" (2008-2009), \\"Storicamente ABC\\" (2010-2011), and \\"Ski Past\\" (2012). \\"Panorama of the Cold War,\\" carried out with Elisabetta Terragni (Studio Terragni Architetti) and Daniele Ledda (XY comm), was exhibited in the Albanian Pavilion of the 2012 Venice Biennale of Architecture and in Erasmus Effect – Architetti italiani all’estero / Italian Architects Abroad at the MAXXI (Dec. 2013-April 2014). He also served as exhibition project consultant for BZ ’18-’45, a documentation center built under Marcello Piacentini’s Bolzano Victory Monument open to the public since July 2014. Effective June 2015, he assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Piaggio Fast Forward. metaLAB In February 2011, Schnapp founded a new laboratory at Harvard under the aegis of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society: metaLAB (at) Harvard with his collaborators James Burns, Daniele Ledda, Kara Oehler, Gerard R. Pietrushko, and Jesse Shapins. It addresses \\"networked culture.\\" MetaLAB has established a leading position in the field of experimental arts and humanities. Its personnel has evolved over the years and it currently defines itself as \\"a concept foundry, knowledge-design lab, and process studio proposing new forms for the networked arts, humanities, and sciences.\\" The About page of its website reads: \\"Digging through dark abundance of media, material, and data collections, metaLAB embraces the processual artifacts buried within the lives of digital and physical objects. As the stories of these objects constellate with a shift from the micro to the macro, they prompt research challenges and opportunities that expose common galaxies for the academy, industry, and the public sphere. To demonstrate and translate unearthed histories and unmapped patterns, metaLAB research inquiries mature as expressive provocations that strive to make invisible connections visible. With a team composed variously of scholars, writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers, metaLAB projects manifest as experiments in publication, pedagogy, and curation showcased in print, on the web, and in exhibited spaces. By combining traditional modes of practice, metaLAB research infuses scholarship with the enterprising spirit of hacking, making, and artistic investigation.\\" The Library Beyond the Book Schnapp's The Library Beyond the Book of 2013 (published in 2014), written with Matthew Battles, surveys elements of libraries potentially relevant to today's transitional digital era. It examines past mainstays such as buildings, shelves, catalogs, access cards, reference desks, carrel desks, and librarians, and wonders how each might find new purpose in the near future. It discusses the importance of databases, digital preservation, mobile libraries, serendipity, cloistering, and meatspaces, and mentions initiatives such as Rio de Janeiro's Manguinhos Library Park, the pop-up Occupy Wall Street Library, Chattanooga Public Library's makerspace, the Digital Public Library of America, and London's Idea Store. In the words of one reviewer, the authors \\"imagine six plausible scenarios for serving tomorrow’s diverse information consumers, situating libraries as everything from study shelters to civic institutions functioning as mobile libraries, reading rooms promoting social change, and/or event-driven knowledge centers.\\" It is the first in a series of Metalab publications \\"that will investigate the role of print-based scholarship in the digital age.\\" Cold Storage Among metaLAB's recent experiments is \\"Cold Storage\\": an experimental web documentary (or so-called database documentary) made up of over 500 media objects developed in 2013-2015 as an “animated archive” and extension of the volume \\"The Library Beyond the Book,\\" published in 2014 in the metaLABprojects series by Harvard University Press. The work was directed by Cristoforo Magliozzi and produced by Schnapp.  Principal books  * The Transfiguration of History at the Center of Dante's Paradise.

He has exhibited internationally including solo shows at BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, and Barbican Art Gallery, London; and group shows at Tate Britain, London, and Centre Pompidou, Paris. His work is held in collections including the Tate Collection, Saatchi Collection, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He lives and works in Newcastle upon Tyne and London. Education Holdsworth studied photography and earned a BA (Hons) in Photography at the London College of Communication, University of The Arts London, UK. Early work Holdsworth gained notice with photographic series such as A Machine For Living (1999) and Megalith (2002), where familiar scenes of service stations, car parks, billboards, or broadcast towers loom as godforsaken outposts, antecedent inklings of a new apocalyptic frontier. Consumed by the exaggerated glow of neon and head lamps, the landscapes' toxic-colour intensity and blurred movements suggest atomic fulguration, illuminating industrial structures like shrines. Holdsworth often uses extremely prolonged exposures to capture the ethereal essence of his scenes; the paradox of these images is that their hyper-acceleration is in fact slow-time aggregation: the lens' observations over minutes, hours, days, record an unnoticed seething of energy, a plausible force of infernal propulsion. In the mid-2000s, Holdsworth began to source his otherworldly scenes from the truly exotic: science fiction possibilities evoked at the ends of the earth, from Europe to North and South America. Key examples from this period are The Gregorian (2005), and Hyperborea (2006) series, which were respectively shot in Puerto Rico at the American National Astronomy and Ionosphere Centre, and in Iceland's interior, the film location of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. Whether picturing a research centre in the guise of a UFO set deep within the jungle, or barren glaciers and mountains diminished beneath the spectacle of northern lights, these images re-imagine the far corners of the earth as a virtual world, fusing primordial wilderness and space-age science. Blackout The series \\"Blackout\\" (2010) was inspired by the infamous power failures in 1960s New York, an event which threw millions of people into darkness and prompted a panicky fear of nuclear attack. Holdsworth's enormous prints are images of mountains and glaciers in Iceland, made mystic and otherworldly through innovations in photographic art. \\"Blackout\\" was first exhibited at Patricia Low Contemporary, Geneva, in 2010. This exhibition included the works Blackout 08, Blackout 13, Blackout 09, and Blackout 07. In 2011, Holdsworth exhibited further \\"Blackout\\" works at major exhibitions at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, UK; and at Nordin Gallery, Stockholm. Each exhibition included a different selection of works from the series. Holdsworth also worked with CIRCA Projects to produce an off-site lightbox installation, Blackout 10, which coincided with the \\"Blackout\\" exhibition at BALTIC, Gateshead. This lightbox installation was Holdsworth's first public installation commission, and the first in a series of large-scale lightbox works. In 2012 his book Blackout, published by Steidl BG, was launched at Brancolini Grimaldi, London. The book contains the complete \\"Blackout\\" series and a new text written by British science writer and editor, Oliver Morton. Transmission: New Remote Earth Views Holdsworth’s 2012 series Transmission: New Remote Earth Views uses topographical data to present the American West in an entirely new way. Locations included are the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Mount Shasta, Mount St. Helens, Salt Lake City, and Park City, UT. The series was first presented in an exhibition at Brancolini Grimaldi, London, UK, in March 2012.

He would thus carry Portpatrick's history back to the first century of our era, while he dates a rather later reference to about AD 250.History of the Celtic Placenames of Scotland. Portpatrick was known as the port of Castle Dunskey. Dunskey is undoubtedly romantic. It was a location for the 1951 film \\"Kidnapped\\" of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, as well as for the 1952 film Hunted. The owner, Lady Amy McFall, restricts public access to the castle. 13th and 14th centuries In the 1290s, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, had a licence from Edward I of England, reigned 1272–1307) to dig for lead in the Calf of Man (off the coast of the Isle of Man), to cover eight towers of the Cruggleton Castle / Crogiltoun Castle in Wigtownshire. Was Dunskey Castle built about this time ?Chalmer's Caledonia (vol. iii. p. 372), quoted by Cumming (History of the Isle of Man, p. 307) and in AD1291 the nearby Wigtown Castle was in the hands of the same Edward I who committed it to the charge of Walter de Currie or Cory / Corry / Coree (laird of Dunskey). King Edward I ultimately conferred Wigtown Castle (and Dunskey Castle ?) on John Balliol the Scottish King (reigned AD1292-1296 after which Scotland was without a monarch for 10 years and Sir William Wallace fought the English in 1297, but was defeated at Falkirk in 1298).The Edinburgh Encyclopedia, vol.18, p.521, by Sir David Brewster, published 1832 in Philadelphia by Joseph Parker. https://books.google.com/books?id=O4wEAAAAYAAJ&q;=Wigton#v=snippet&q;=Wigton&f;=false By 10 October 1303 Walter de Corry was dead and his lands were taken into the King's hands (King Edward I of England).Fine Rolls, i 483Dumfriesshire and Galloway \\"Transactions and Journal of Proceedings\\" Ed: R.C.

The Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry has decided that the most recent version, ELMER2, shall be the common guidelines for user interfaces in Norwegian public forms for enterprises on the Internet. All public forms in Norway shall be based on the ELMER guidelines within the end of 2008 . The Norwegian authorities emphasize that simplification of public forms is important to improve communication between the users and the public sector. The idea is expressed like this in the preface of the guidelines: > \\"The proceeding transition to electronic reporting may be an important > simplification measure for the respondents, but only if the Internet-based > solutions are felt to be more user friendly than the old paper versions. By > applying good pedagogical principles, electronic forms may also ensure a > better understanding of the task, better validation of the data before > submission, and by that even better response quality and more efficient > processing by the relevant authority.\\" The objective of the ELMER guidelines is to meet the challenges of Internet design and pedagogics that are particular to web forms. WCAG requirements and W3C conventions have not been baked into the ELMER guidelines, but they shall not contain recommendations which are incompatible with these. In other words, ELMER is not the only set of guidelines to consider, when designing electronic forms, but the only one that concentrate on the form itself. Background The first ELMER Project During the summer of 2000, an interdisciplinary reference group on electronic reporting initiated the ELMER project. The project followed six enterprises over the period of one year in order to map out their reporting duties, and test simple solutions for electronic reporting based on familiar technology. Among other things, the ELMER project presented an example for design of a complex web form. First and foremost the example demonstrated that the use of simple Internet technology opens up for new pedagogical opportunities which may make reporting to governmental authorities a lot easier. The ELMER 2 Project In 2005 the ELMER 2 project developed the example towards a comprehensive set of principles and specifications for the design of Internet-based forms. Business organizations, governmental bodies, usability experts and form developers were invited to submit suggestions and to take part in debates during the process. Open workshops were held, and a number of authorities and experts wrote, read and commented contributions posted on the project discussion forum. ELMER 2 has evolved through co-operation between enterprises and experts. The participants have experiences from designing forms for several agencies and suppliers, from the reception and use of the same forms by the inquirer, and from usability testing of ELMER1-based and other electronic forms in varied user groups. The guidelines The Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry submitted the draft for public hearing in the autumn of 2005. The approved ELMER 2 guidelines was published in October 2006. The guidelines are being administered by the Brønnøysund Register Centre. References #Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. \\"Forenkling for næringslivet\\", 2007-01-15.

Originally aired on November 1, 2005, on FOX network, the episode is written by Laura Wolner and directed by Allan Kroeker. The plot features FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan's investigation concerning a human hand that was found inside a bear in Washington state. The Man in the Bear summary at the official Bones site Summary To Brennan's dismay, Booth takes her, with Dr. Goodman's permission, to small town Aurora, Washington, to identify the victim whose arm was found inside a black bear. From a photograph taken of the arm, Brennan sees that the victim had his arm cut off by a saw before the bear ate it. Once there, Booth and Brennan meet with the sheriff and the local doctors. The victim is a young male but only one person has been reported missing — a woman by the name of Ann Noyes. Brennan sends the bone fragments back to the Jeffersonian, where her assistant, Zack Addy, debrides them and finds indentations belonging to bite marks from a human — Brennan realizes the killer is a cannibal. Since a cannibal would get sick with prion disease, Brennan visits local coroner Dr. Andrew Rigby to ask him if he has met with any patients with such symptoms. He says that he has not. Back at the lab, Dr. Jack Hodgins examines the bear scat Brennan had sent to him and finds a flap of skin with a tattoo, which turns out to be a Haida Sun motif, when recreated by Angela Montenegro. From the tattoo, the sheriff is able to find the victim's identity via a missing persons check. The victim is Adam Langer, and according to the sheriff, he used to come up to Aurora to visit Sherman Rivers, the town's Native American Park Ranger. However, when Booth and Brennan go to question Rivers, he escapes into the woods. They find Rivers the next morning in the woods. From the evidence Booth and Brennan gathered from Rivers' house, they are convinced that he is a poacher but not the cannibal. With Hodgins' expertise and Rivers' help, they find the crime scene in the woods, where they also find a perverse version of a medicine wheel and two dead bodies belonging to Adam Langer and Ann Noyes, whose heart has been removed. Based on adipocere formation, Brennan estimates Ann Noyes has been dead for about a week. When it is revealed that Adam Langer was seeing local veterinarian Dr. Denise Randall, Booth and Brennan corner her at a local bar, where they get her to bite into a block of dental medium so they can check her teeth marks. However, Brennan points out that Randall had no motives for killing Ann Noyes and that they are more likely looking for someone who is clinically insane. Meanwhile, Zack finds more marks on Ann Noyes's sternum, which Brennan determines to be made by a sternum spreader. She realizes that Dr. Rigby would have seen this beforehand but did not mention it because he is the cannibal. Booth and Brennan find Rigby in the process of cremating the bodies; Brennan knocks Rigby out with a bedpan. During the episode, Hodgins and Zack vie for the attention of the parcel delivery person, played by K. D. Aubert, who later turns out to be bisexual, choosing Angela over Hodgins and Zack. Music The episode featured the following music: * Mike Doughty – \\"Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well\\" * Peter Himmelman – \\"Big Me\\" Production details The episode was written as the series' fifth episode but broadcast as the fourth. According to Laura Wolner, writer of the episode, the idea for the episode came from her interest in cannibalism and that it would be fascinating to see \\"teeth marks on bones that turned out not to be from an animal, but from a human\\".

Johannes von Gmunden (; c. 1380/84 - February 23, 1442) was a German/Austrian astronomer, mathematician, humanist and early instrument maker. Biography Johannes von Gmunden received the degree of a master of arts at the University of Vienna in 1406. From 1408, he was a lecturer at Vienna, lecturing on Aristotle's Physics (1408) and Meteora (1409, 1411), Peter of Spain (1410) and Algorismus de minutiis (1412). He fell seriously ill in 1412. In 1415 and 1416 studied theology, completing a Bachelor of Theology in 1416.Christoph Schöner, Mathematik und Astronomie an der Universität Ingolstadt im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert, Duncker & Humblot, 1994, p. 69. He continued lecturing only in 1419, on algorismus de integris. From 1420, Johannes was permitted to restrict his teaching to the specialized field of the mathematics of astronomy, focusing on Euclid's Elements and the Sphaera materialis of John Holywood. With the aid of students (Weidler's 1741 Historia astronomiae names Georg Pruneck of Ruspach, Georg of Neuenburg, Johannes Schinkel and Johannes Feldner) he compiled voluminous astronomical tables. In 1425, he was elected canon at St. Stephen's Cathedral. Georg von Peuerbach succeeded him at Vienna University in 1450. John's origins are somewhat disputed. He was probably born in Gmunden, Upper Austria, but there were also suggestions connecting him with Gmünd, Lower Austria, or that he was a Swabian from Schwäbisch Gmünd who studied in Ulm in his youth, based on a document written at Ulm in 1404 by one \\"Johannes Wissbier de Gamundia\\".

A centre-half, Methven began his career with East Fife in 1974, whilst also working as a mineworker. He went on to make 154 league appearances and score fifteen goals in five years, before joining Wigan Athletic in September 1979 for a fee of £30,000. Methven remained at Springfield Park for seven years, making close to 300 appearances for the club and scoring 21 goals. He was part of the team that won the Freight Rover Trophy in 1985. He was the club's captain when Blackpool came in for his services in 1986 for £20,000. He made his debut for the Seasiders on the opening day of the 1986–87 season in a goalless draw with Chesterfield at Bloomfield Road and became a virtual ever-present for the next four years. Methven was a \\"footballing\\" centre-half who enjoyed going up for attacking corners, as evidenced by his 50 career league goals, and he was voted Player of the Year for two consecutive years by Blackpool's fans, who were angry when he was sold to Walsall in November 1990 after an earlier loan spell at Carlisle. In his early days of his short spell as Blackpool manager, Graham Carr declared that Methven was \\"neither fast enough nor good enough for Fourth Division football\\".Calley, Roy: Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887-1992, Breedon Books Sport, 1992. In the final game of the 1990–91 season, on 11 May 1991, Methven helped Walsall to a 2–0 win at Blackpool, denying the hosts automatic promotion to Division Three. In 1998, Wigan Athletic fans voted Methven as the club's Best Football League Player of All-Time. Methven finished his career with Barrow in 1994.

Known for the screenplay of iconic film Came a Hot Friday which he co-wrote with Ian Mune, the television film Old Scores and recent play Midnight in Moscow and was awarded Laureate of the New Zealand Arts Foundation in 2010.  Biography   Early years  Parker was born in Napier, Hawke's Bay. He went to school at Napier Marist and St John's College, Hastings. By 1969 he was living in London, England. While of mainly Irish ancestry, he knew little of the Irish struggle until The Troubles began that year in Northern Ireland. Parker joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Solidarity Campaign, led by the International Socialists (now known as the Socialist Workers Party), and immersed himself in literature on the Irish struggle. He continued his involvement with the International Socialists into the early 1970s, attending branch meetings in West London, with his old Napier friend, Blair Peach. Peach was later killed while participating in a 1979 anti-National Front rally.  Career  Parker worked as a writer for much of his life and was prominent in his union, the New Zealand Writers Guild. His plays included Midnight in Moscow — which The Press reviewer Alan Scott called \\"entertaining and thought-provoking\\" and \\"one of his best to date\\" — 2005's Iraq-set Baghdad, Baby, and an adaptation of Nicky Hager's exposé The Hollow Men. He won awards in New Zealand for teleplay Share the Dream (starring Joel Tobeck), and co-writing the successful big-screen comedy Came a Hot Friday. The 1985 film centered on two conmen in small town New Zealand, and was adapted from the novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson. Parker's theatrical CV included The Feds, Two Fingers From Frank Zappa, and adaptations of Great Expectations, and The Trial. He also wrote many radio plays, among them Joe Stalin Knew My Father and Engels F: A History of the Ould Sod. Arguably his best-known television work is Welsh-Kiwi rugby tale Old Scores, which Parker co-wrote with ex All Black triallist and occasional soccer player Greg McGee. The two also co-created the 1980s trucking series Roche, whose cast included John Bach and Andy Anderson, and goldmining drama Gold, a co-production between New Zealand and Canada. Parker also worked on episodes of police drama Mortimer's Patch, Betty's Bunch, and documentary Just Slightly, A People Apart: The Irish in NZ. In 1990 Parker co-directed Shattered Dreams, a documentary on the years leading up to the 1951 Waterfront strike. By 1975, Parker was back in New Zealand. Horrified at the election of National Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, Parker joined the pro-Soviet Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand and soon became chairman of its Auckland City Branch. He was active in the Campaign for an Independent East Timor and played soccer for the Halt All Racist Tours team for a number of years, though the quality of his play was purportedly variable. In July 1977 he penned the first of many articles on Ireland for the SUP's paper, Tribune. By the late 1970s the SUP had decided to ally with the Labour Party. Parker resigned from the SUP in 1978, though he remained a supporter into the late 1980s. In 1979 Parker travelled to Northern Ireland, visiting West Belfast and trouble spots like the Falls Road. Returning to New Zealand, Parker helped form H Block/Armagh in 1980/81 as a support group for republican prisoners in Irish jails. Parker served on the editorial board of the organisation's publication Saoirse from 1982 until its demise in 2000. Parker contributed regular articles on Irish issues to SUP publications until the party split in 1990. In 1991 Parker was a member of the Editorial Group of the socialist journal Agenda. He was also active in the Workers' Charter Movement, a joint project of Socialist Worker, SPA, John Minto's Global Peace and Justice Auckland and Matt McCarten's Unite Union. He also contributed to the New Zealand Listener and The New Zealand Herald. Parker made no bones about his Marxism–Leninism and injecting his politics into his art. In the socialist journal Sites, No. 16 Autumn 1988, he wrote, \\"I would describe myself as a class-conscious writer. I'm with Lenin. I'm for the working class seizing control of the wealth it creates, for the replacement of parliament, the army, the police, the judiciary — all those deadly manacles of state control — with workers' committees and militias, and all this done as part of a world-wide struggle ...\\"  Personal life  Parker and his partner Isabel lived in Ponsonby, Auckland and had a son. Parker died on 14 April 2020 aged 72, having finished a stage adaption of Albert Camus' The Plague the previous day.  Works  Selected works produced by Dean Parker over his career are listed below.

Ross opened a school in Flint, Michigan, under the name Learning Foundations. That school provided \\"after school\\" academic instruction to kindergarten through twelfth grade students. Six additional schools were opened from 1969 through 1971 by Mr. Ross. In 1971, the name of the company was changed to Ross Learning, Inc., and the focus of the company shifted to providing prevocational and vocational training services to adults. Ross Learning was purchased by Howard J. Hulsman in 1973 and the organization began evolving into career training centers. In 1976, Ross opened the more comprehensive instructional services of the Ross Medical Education Centers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Ross Learning, Inc. opened many schools across the Midwestern and Southern United States, all of which operated as Ross Medical Education Center, Ross Business Institute, or Ross Technical Institute. In 2004, Mr. Hulsman sold Ross Learning, Inc., to three officers of the corporation: Christine Ossenmacher, Paul Mitchell, and Richard Lockman. In 2005, Paul Mitchell, Huron Capital Partners, LLC and minority investors formed Ross Education, LLC and purchased the assets of Ross Learning, Inc. By 2007, Ross adds a Medical Insurance Billing and Office Administration program to many of its campuses. This addition is followed closely by a Dental Assistant program in 2008. On May 1, 2008 an acquisition was made to purchase the Institute of Medical and Dental Technology located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Between 2008 and 2010, Ross Education, LLC. moved all of its schools into larger, brighter facilities, roughly 3 times their previous size. In 2011, the Ross Medical Education Center in Sylvania, Ohio changed its name to Ross College. Ross College Online was created to offer associate degree programs. In 2011, Ross also became an investment of JLL Partners.https://www.jllpartners.com/ross-education In March 2012, Ross launched its Pharmacy Technician program in seven campuses.http://www.prlog.org/11819442-ross-medical-education-center-launches- new-pharmacy-technician-program-at-7-locations-in-mi-in-oh.html On June 1, 2012 the name was officially changed to Ross Medical Education Center. Today, Ross provides Medical Insurance Billing and Office Administration and Medical Assistant training in over 30 communities throughout Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Alabama, and West Virginia. At several of the campus locations, the Dental Assistant, Pharmacy Technician, and Veterinary Assistant programs are also offered.  Acquisitions  In May 2008, Ross Education, LLC purchased Institute of Medical-Dental Technology.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/daily5.html This location was renamed to Ross Institute of Medical and Dental Technology. On June 1, 2012 the name was officially changed to Ross Medical Education Center.

Early life and education Khan is a Muslim by origin. His father is from Pakistan. His mother converted to Islam after meeting his father. Khan graduated in photography from the University of Derby in 2001, he studied for an MA at the Royal College of Art in 2004.www.iniva.org Idris Khan Career Khan's photographs or scans originate from secondary source material – for instance, every page of the Qur'an, every Beethoven sonata, every William Turner postcard from Tate Britain, or every Bernd and Hilla Becher spherical gasholder.Dan Hicks and Mary C. Beaudry 2006 . Introduction: the place of historical archaeology. In Dan Hicks and Mary C. Beaudry (eds) The Cambridge Companion to Historical Archaeology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 8–9 Khan's interest in Islam and layered imagery can be traced back to his upbringing: It was his father's idea that Khan – himself a non-practicing Muslim – photograph every page of the Qur'an. His work and process have been described as \\"experiments in compressed memories\\" and \\"all-encompassing composites.\\" As Khan describes: \\"It is a challenge to not define my work as a photograph but using the medium of photography to create something that exists on the surface of the paper and not to be transported back to an isolated moment in time.\\" Khan's visual layering also occurs in his videos, such as Last Three Piano Sonatas…after Franz Schubert, a three-channel video installation wherein he uses multiple camera angles to capture numerous performances of Schubert's last sonatas, composed on his deathbed. In 2012, Khan was commissioned by the British Museum in London to create a new wall drawing for the exhibition, Hajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam. In addition to the wall drawing, a sculpture was installed in the museum's Great Court. Also in 2012, The New York Times Magazine commissioned Khan to create a new body of work that was published in their London issue, focusing on iconic sites. In 2016, Khan was commissioned to build a memorial to the war dead of the United Arab Emirates. The sculpture is constructed from seven aluminium-encased steel tablets, cast with poems by emirs of the UAE.Rachel Spence (7 February 2020), Idris Khan on his spiritual heritage and the power of colour Financial Times.

According to Radio France, he is \\"one of the most important contemporary masters in the field of engraving.\\"Miguel Condé, gentleman del grabado Radio France Radio France Official web site Condé's works are in important museum collections all over the world; he is exhibiting regularly at both public and private venues, and he has received numerous international honors and awards. Early life Miguel Condé was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Salvador Condé Álvarez, a Mexican painter, and Victoria Weiner, an American poet. He grew up in his father's house in Mexico. Although the house was not a traditional artist's atelier, it was a place where Salvador drew and painted and which Miguel found to be \\"a very attractive place because all the walls were painted a strange shade of green, and it was full of stuff like papier mâché skeletons. It was a magic place where you could make up all sorts of stories.\\"Peppiatt, Michael. Miguel Condé: Pêle- mêle, 1972-2006, page 23. Barcelona: Edifici Miramar, 2007. . Retrieved 32 August 2012. Young Condé split his time between Mexico and the United States until 1948 when he moved to New York with his mother. He attended P.S. 6 and Walden School, both in Manhattan, and graduated in 1956. Career –Miguel Condé In 1956, at age 17, Condé rented a studio in New York and began to study anatomy with renowned American artist and anatomist Stephen Rogers Peck, author of the classic manual Atlas for Human Anatomy for the Artist. He also attended courses taught by the Harvard Art History professor and curator Millard Meiss, at the Fogg Art Museum. Condé returned to Mexico in 1959 and settled in Tepoztlán, a popular tourist destination near Mexico City. In 1963 he was awarded a scholarship by the French government (Bourse d’Etudes Libres), so he moved to Paris where he studied with Stanley William Hayter in his Atelier 17.Artists Who Have Worked at Atelier 17 (1950-1988) In 1966, Condé returned to the United States and soon afterwards accepted a teaching position in drawing and mixed media in the graduate program at the University of Iowa School of Art. In Iowa City he met and befriended an Argentinian-born American artist and printmaker Mauricio Lasansky and the influential Chilean author José Donoso. Condé became a McDowell Fellow in 1966 and concentrated full-time on his work in visual arts. In 1968, his solo exhibition opened to critical acclaim at the prestigious Galería de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City. Later that year, William Liebrerman, curator of MoMA, acquired two of his drawings for the permanent collection of the New York Museum of Modern Art. In 1969, he traveled to France and then moved with his family to Sitges, Catalonia, Spain. In 1971, Condé worked at the Smithsonian Institution Print Workshop in Barcelona, which reignited his interest in graphic art. It was then that he met the prominent Spanish art dealer and print publisher Juana Mordó who offered him his first exhibition in Spain, which occurred in 1974. He became a foreign Artist-in-residence at the Cleveland Institute of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1972. An exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art took place the following year. In 1974, Condé was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship by the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 1976, Miguel Condé: paintings and drawings exhibition was organized by the Scottish Arts Council and took place in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1977, Condé participated in Documenta 6 in Kassel, Germany. Documenta 6 List of Artists In 1978, an exhibition Miguel Condé: Guggenheim Suite took place at the Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid. In 1980, he was invited and took part in Peintres-Graveurs Français exhibition at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. In 1983, the Ministry of Culture of Spain organized an extensive retrospective exhibition Miguel Condé: 20 años de obra grabada at the Sala Picasso of Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid. In a review of Condé's graphic work on display there, art critic and prolific author Fernando Huici opined that it was \\"paper—already forgotten in the absurd hierarchy of genres—in both drawing and engraving, where Condé finds most freedom, where he expresses with greater ease his particular vocabulary of images... \\" Another retrospective of the artist, Miguel Condé: Pinturas, Gouaches, Dibujos, opened at the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum later the same year.Artista: Miguel Condé on Mudmedia In 1993, Condé met a Danish born, Madrid based printer and publisher Dan Benveniste, who would become his printer and, eventually, a collaborator in graphic projects.Se inaugura la Exposición El Canto del Grabado de Miguel Condé OBRA GRÁFICA 1977-2007 Marbella TV That same year, Ediciones Eegee-3 published 19 etchings printed by Dan Benveniste and presented them at the Fundación Carlos de Amberes in Madrid. In 1998, a large scale installation Grandes Formatos opened at the Centro Cultural del Conde Duque in Madrid, Spain. The critically acclaimed exhibition was sponsored by the City council of Madrid and received a lot of media attention. Discussing his work with the art critic of the influential Spanish El Pais, Condé said, \\"My characters are fictional and come from fantasy, but they are not surreal. I always paint figuratively, and everyone has to interpret each work for himself... The treatment is different in painting versus drawing, denser and more susceptible to complex situations. Painting is dominated by gesture, by brushstroke and material, and I tend to concentrate on the character, without adding landscapes or architecture.\\" In 1999, a collection of Condé's recent paintings went on exhibit at the Sales San Fernando in Seville, Spain. Both exhibitions were timed to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Condé's permanent move to Spain. Numerous other exhibitions at both private and public venues followed,Miguel Condé: Pele-mele 1972-2006 ArtDaily Official web siteEl Cant del Gravat Andorra Official web site the more recent ones taking place in 2011, at the Museo del Grabado Español Contemporáneo in Marbella, SpainEl Museo del Grabado inaugura la exposición de Miguel Condé 'El Canto del Grabado' Marbella Official web site and the Goya Museum in Castres, France. Reviewing one such exhibition, J.M. Martí Font, Paris bureau chief for El Pais,J.M. Martí Font, chef du bureau parisien du quotidien espagnol \\"El Pais\\" Libération Official web site quoted the prominent art scholar and author Maria Lluïsa Borràs, who wrote that Condé \\"revels in recovery for modernity subjects fitting of Cervantes or Quevedo, scenes and characters that evoke the aesthetics of the late Middle Ages even though they find themselves on the fringes of both time and history. In his compositions, increasingly more complex and meticulous, the absurd and the enigmatic gradually come together, Goya’s black irony, Bosch’s phantasmagorias, Brueghel’s repulsion and fluidity, and Dürer’s virtuoso drawing.\\" A similar sentiment was expressed by art critic Fernando Huici who remarked in 1983 that \\"the world that inhabits Condé's creations, the world of his intimate fascinations, always maintains a Brueghelian flavor.\\" In 2012, Miguel Condé was featured in Michael Peppiatt's book Interviews with artists 1966 – 2012, published by the Yale University Press, along such post-war and contemporary masters as Francis Bacon, Balthus, Henry Moore, Diego Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, Sean Scully, and Antoni Tàpies, to name a few. Personal life Miguel Condé married Carola Schisel in Mexico, in 1960. They have two children: a son Amadeo, who was born in Paris in 1964, and a daughter, Caëtana María del Pilar, who was born in Iowa City in 1969. They split their time between Madrid and Sitges, Spain, where Condé works and maintains studios.

Using sculpture, painting, and installation, Jacob Hashimoto creates complex worlds from a range of modular components: bamboo-and-paper kites, model boats, even astroturf-covered blocks. His accretive, layered compositions reference video games, virtual environments, and cosmology, while also remaining deeply rooted in art-historical traditions notably, landscape- based abstraction, modernism, and handcraft.  Early life and education  Much of Hashimoto’s work materials reflect traditional Japanese culture. Despite his strong ties to the culture, however, he has not been to Japan and does not speak the language. His connection instead comes from his Japanese- American father. His mother, on the other hand, is Irish-American. Hashimoto grew up in Walla Walla, Washington, where his mother, who had studied art as a college student, had her own studio. Although he enjoyed drawing and creating art in her studio, he did not plan to pursue an art degree in college. During his second year at Carleton College, he took a printmaking class, changed his mind about his career, and decided to send an application to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. After his acceptance, he returned home to paint and work in the studio of Keiko Hara for a year before returning to school. It was during his senior year at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago that he began to make the kites that would appear in much of his later work. This initial experience with the kites created a means for him to shift from his position as a college student to a real-world artist.  Career  Hashimoto’s career began with exhibitions designed for galleries and has since shown work internationally in many exhibitions including The Nature of Objects at Studio la Città in Verona, Black Sea at XIV Quadriennale di Roma at Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome, Made in California NOW at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York and has had The Dark Isn't The Thing To Worry About and In the Cosmic Fugue at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago. After graduating college, Hashimoto began working as a preparator in the Ann Nathan Gallery which allowed him to continue pursuing his personal art at night. On Thanksgiving weekend, he was allowed to set up his first kite exhibit in the gallery in order for the piece to be photographed. After which, Nathan encouraged him to leave it up as a public exhibit. Upon viewing the installation, the chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Richard Francis, approached Hashimoto with an offer to display works in the cafe at the MoCA. Hashimoto completed the exhibition with the aid of many family members and friends. The massive collection of 15,000 kites was displayed for 18 months.  Techniques   Kites  Because his pieces are produced from a vast number of kites, Hashimoto enlists the help of various assistants from friends to employed workers. When it comes to the designs these assistants collage each kite, he places little restrictions on their creativity. Hashimoto must then find a way to incorporate each kite into his piece in a way that still speaks to his personal style and artistic values. This method of construction often forces him to solve unexpected formal issues and to explore ideas he would not normally encounter. As far as idealizing his installations is concerned, Hashimoto relates his methods to those of a painter. He mainly follows his intuition, allowing the paper to respond to the ideas he generates in his head and the emotions he wishes to communicate through his work. The paper Hashimoto uses for his kites is manufactured in Japan by four or five specific paper mills. Without this paper, it would be difficult to produce the effects he strives to create in his work (such as opacity, transparency, and diverse color) as paper made in the United States does not exhibit the same qualities. When collaging with this paper, he uses a variety of papers such as natural fiber paper, rayon, traditional rice paper, and Washi paper.  Waterblocks  Waterblocks is the name Hashimoto has given to his 3-D wave-like sculptures. Using a 3-D computer program, he creates these acrylic glass sculptures by altering, layering, and combining different blocks. The blocks are then arranged on the floor in a grid format, replicating the movement of water that has been frozen in this seemingly fragile form. The way in which he layers and arranges the forms is similar to how he works with his kites and also resembles the manipulation of clay.  Exhibitions  Hashimoto's exhibit in the Ronchini Gallery.Hashimoto's exhibits display his numerous paper kites and sometimes other mediums as well. The paper kites hang from the ceiling and vary in layers, anywhere from six kites deep to the entire length of the gallery. His collections of hundreds to thousands of kites are made from both colored and white paper. Although Hashimoto claims his work to be abstract and without narrative, he admits that his installations often reference various landscapes.  Landscapes of Vision  This exhibit is a large collection of pieces that all represent nature, some intentionally more abstract than others. One piece, created in 2008, is a wooden tree, Tree III, that holds giant white balls of light in place of leaves. The design is intended to resemble growing technology and children's playground equipment. The original idea was to hang 700 smaller balls of light from the ceiling that would place the viewer in a digital reality. Hashimoto had the goal of making a sculpture that was both digital and physical. But, to better approach the space at Studio La Città, a wooden tree was made. The idea of a tree came from images of trees that were dotted with paper prayers in the branches. A tree that became sacred while representing the influence of the digital world in American society, especially American children, was the position Hashimoto was aiming for. Another part of this exhibit was a giant two-dimensional piece against the wall, made in 2008, named Diving Deep and Surfacing. This piece is built up with layers and layers of grass that appear artificial. Hashimoto admits that this piece came from inspiration from his previous exhibits. The grass had been applied to his many kite exhibits, but he had never attached the grass to a simple square shape before this exhibit. The ground approaching this piece is covered in a black sculpture. These black acrylic bases, called Gun Metal Blue Waves, also made in 2008, are designed based on ocean waves. Pushing the limits between digital and organic creations, Hashimoto created an organic sculpture from a mass digital creation. The black color is intended to force the viewer to notice the waves, despite the non-naturalistic colors. A third room in the exhibit held the piece Infinite Expanse of Sky and Superabundant Atmosphere. Both of these works have been exhibited together previously. Infinite Expanse of Sky is a collection of rectangle kites that are blue with white clouds drawn on them. The original sculpture was created in 1998. Superabundant Atmosphere is a collection of white, oval kites. This piece was started originally exhibited in 2005. The slight variations between different exhibit locations include increasing the length and decreasing the width of the experience and placing the two pieces next to each other with the blue kites on the left and the white kites on the right. A bench was added at the front of the room. The seat gives the vantage point that Hashimoto determined is the most ideal for viewing the entirety of the piece. The kites are well above the viewer's head at the entrance of the room, but as the piece extends further back, the kites gradually become lower, until they hit the floor. Other, more 2-dimensional kite works that were displayed in the Landscapes of Vision exhibit included Hodge Podge, 2008; Grassscape, 2008; Descending Yellow Halo, 2008; Field of Green Blocks, 2008; Water for Elephants, 2008; Superliner, 2007; Velocity of Desire, 2008; Redshroom, 2008; Field of Yellow Blocks, 2009; Odds and Ends, 2008; Far Rockaway, 2009; and The Return, 2009. There were also several rectangle paintings on paper and linen. These included Vapors and Night Skies, 2008; Inverted Night Reflection, 2008; Single Black Cloud, 2008; Some Things You Can't Ignore, 2008; and Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel, 2008. Of the painted pieces, all were done in acrylic. The first four listed are in all painted in greyscale. Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel is the only acrylic piece made with multiple colors.  Gas Giant  This exhibit is made to be set up in two separate rooms. The first room consists of mostly black and white elements and is designed to lead the viewer into the second room. The second room is the focal point of the exhibit. An entire environment is created with the hanging paper kites. Square pieces with grass glued on collect in one corner. White, oval kites start low and lead the eye towards the ceiling where there is a multitude of shapes forming out of colorful kites. The exhibit was displayed a total of three times starting in 2012 at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago. It was then moved to the Fondazione Querini Stampalia and finally the MOCA Pacific Design Center.  Influences  Hashimoto claims that the idea that a piece can fully surround the viewer while maintaining some form of two- dimensionality comes from pieces made by Mark Rothko. Staring at a Rothko piece gave the idea of standing in a literal field of color and Hashimoto wanted to replicate that. Although Oriental influence appears frequently in his work, Hashimoto claims to be affected by other elements as well. For example, during his time at school, much of his work reflected the styles of Robert Ryman and Agnes Martin and he adopted the strict grid format from both artists. Inspired by Jessica Stockholder and Ann Hamilton's ability to turn a painting into a sculpture, Hashimoto took the first steps to surrounding and involving the viewer directly.

He studied in Prodiseño, Caracas, his degree and a later PhD at Universitat de Barcelona (1990–1995 and 1998–2001), and an MA at the Royal college of Art in London (1996-1998), city where he has since settled. His main tutors through the years include Eugenio Espinoza in Caracas (1989-1990), Joan Hernández Pijuan and Joaquim Chancho in Barcelona (1992–1995), Claude Viallat in Paris (1994), and Peter Doig, John Dougill, Jo Stockham and Paul Huxley in London (1996–1998). Throughout his career, Jaime Gili has developed the universal abstract language of the mid-20th Century into contemporary painting. More specifically, his work has been contextualised as a revision of Latin American abstraction, especially the Venezuelan optical and kinetic work of artists such as Carlos Cruz-Diez and Alejandro Otero, with an input from popular art and London's energy. Critic Fisun Guner wrote in 2003 about his show at the Jerwood Space: \\"What do you get when you mix Pop Art, Minimalism, Vorticism, Futurism and graffiti art? The answer may well resemble the work of (...) Jaime Gili.\\" Venezuelan Curator Jesús Fuenmayor wrote in 2006 for the catalogue of Gili's show at Periférico Caracas that his paintings were \\"as if someone had thrown a bomb at a work by Carlos Cruz-Diez\\". Swiss curator Oliver Kielmayer, wrote in 2009 \\"Jaime Gili seems to combine the wilderness of the jungle with a formalist and reductionist artistic language; the result is a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk, a crystalline pulsating organism that almost comes alive.\\" He completed a PhD at the University of Barcelona in 2001 with a thesis on \\"Repetition and Serial art since the 1960s\\". Speed and Repetition in painting have been his main research subjects throughout his study years but they still show in his paintings. He has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including '6 Bienal do Mercosul' in Porto Alegre; 'Expander' at the Royal Academy of Arts in London; 'Las tres calaveras' at Periferico Caracas in Caracas; 'Jump Cuts' at CIFO in Miami; 'The Complex of Respect' at Kunsthalle Bern; \\"Bill at Pittier\\" at Kunsthalle Winterthur and 'Indica', a show recreating the 1960s Indica Gallery at Riflemaker in London. Apart from his exhibitions, which have recently happened mainly in Miami, Caracas and London, he has also been invited to make several permanent works integrated into architecture. In Venezuela he completed \\"Diamante de las Semillitas\\", a work in Petare, a very high density informal city with a colonial core in the East of Caracas. He was also chosen to create a site-specific design for 16 large industrial storage tanks, in what would become one of the world's largest public art projects .

He was also one of the earlier advocates of the term African American as opposed to Negro, or \\"black\\".Richard B. Moore, The Name \\"Negro\\": Its Origin and Evil Use (1960), Baltimore, MD: Black Classic Press, 1992. Biography Early years Richard Benjamin Moore was a Barbadian writer born on 9 August 1893 in Barbados, West Indies, to Richard Henry Moore and Josephine Thorne Moore. In Barbados, the Richard Henry and Josephine Moore family was considered middle- class in terms of socioeconomic status. Richard Henry Moore was the moneymaker of the family, working as a preacher and building contractor in Barbados. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Richard B. Moore’s mother died when he was three years old. Moore’s father later remarried, to Elizabeth Mclean. Soon thereafter, Moore’s father died in 1902 when young Richard was aged nine. With both biological parents dead, Moore was raised by his stepmother Elizabeth Mclean. Mclean wanted to carry out Richard senior’s wishes of giving young Richard the best education. It is for this reason that Mclean aided young Richard in traveling to the United States. In hopes of furthering his education, Moore migrated to The United States of America and arrived in New York City on 4 July 1909. However, Moore would not become a naturalised citizen until 11 September 1924. Although African Americans were free in the United States, they were far from being treated equal to European-Americans in America. Moore was immediately faced with ethnic discrimination when it came to employment and educational opportunities among other things. Although trained in Barbados to do clerical work, he was forced to turn to the more unfavourable jobs such as elevator operator and work in a silk manufacturing firm. Political activism Due to the struggles that Moore encountered and observed, he became a strong advocate for the rights of African Americans. In 1919 he joined the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB), which was an organization formed to defend African Americans from race riots and lynching. Moore, along with other African-American advocates, joined the Socialist Party in the early 1920s. Moore joined the Socialist Party, in part, because at the time the Socialist party was transforming itself into a force to fight against segregation. Moore was a frequent political candidate of the Socialist Party. In 1928 he ran for U.S. Congress in New York's 21st Congressional District.\\"Red Ticket Goes on Ballot in NY State\\", Daily Worker, vol. 5, no. 241 (11 October 1928), p. 3. In 1934, Moore ran on the Socialist ticket for Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. In 1935, he became the organiser for the International Labor Defense in the New England Territory. He used his position in this organisation to speak on behalf the Scottsboro Boys, a case in which nine young African-American males were accused of raping two young European-American women. In 1942, Moore was expelled from the Socialist Party because he was accused of being an African-American nationalist; keeping African-American issues on the front burner. He continued his efforts for equal rights in America. He also played a leading role in Caribbean advocacy groups. Moore, like his friend Hubert Harrison, was a bibliophile, collecting over 15,000 books and pamphlets on the African-American experiences worldwide. This collection of books is currently housed in a library that Moore developed in Barbados. Moore also ran the Frederick Douglass Book Center in Harlem. Moore wrote a few books himself, including The Name Negro, Its Origin and Evil Use (1960) and Caribs, Cannibals and Human Relations (1972). He also had essays and articles published in various magazines and journals including the Negro Champion, Daily Worker, and Freedomways. Death and legacy Richard Benjamin Moore died in his homeland of Barbados in 1978 at the age of 85. Footnotes Further reading Joyce Moore Turner and W. Burghart Turner, \\"Richard B.

Members of the genus are commonly known as jack-beans. The species of Canavalia endemic to the Hawaiian Islands were named āwikiwiki by the Native Hawaiians. The name translates to \\"the very quick one\\" (1992): New Pocket Hawaiian Dictionary with a Concise Grammars and Given Names in Hawaiian. University of Hawaii PRess, Honolulu. and comes from the Hawaiian word for \\"fast\\" that has also been appropriated into the name \\"Wikipedia\\". The genus name is derived from the Malabar word for the species, kavavali, which means \\"forest climber.\\" Uses Several species are valued legume crops, including common jack-bean (C. ensiformis), sword bean (C. gladiata) and C. cathartica. At least the first makes a beneficial weed- and pathogen-suppressing living mulch. The common jack-bean is also a source of the lectin concanavalin A, which is used as a reagent in glycoprotein biochemistry and immunology. The jack-bean is also a common source of purified urease enzyme used in scientific research. The bay bean (Canavalia rosea) is supposedly mildly psychoactive when smoked, and is used in tobacco substitutes. Ecology Some animals have adaptations to the defensive chemicals of jack-beans. Caterpillars such as that of the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator) are sometimes found on Canavalia. The plant pathogenic ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella canavaliae was described from a jack-bean. Introduced herbivores have wreaked havoc on Canavalia on the Hawaiian Islands and made some nearly extinct; it may be that these lost their chemical defenses because no herbivorous mammals existed in their range until introduced by humans. The usually bright pea-flowers are pollinated by insects such as solitary bees and carpenter bees such as Xylocopa confusa.

It phosphorylates pantothenate (vitamin B5) to form 4'-phosphopantothenate at the expense of a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of CoA. CoA is a necessary cofactor in all living organisms. It acts as the major acyl group carrier in many important cellular processes, such as the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and fatty acid metabolism. Consequently, pantothenate kinase is a key regulatory enzyme in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. Types Three distinct types of PanK has been identified - PanK-I (found in bacteria), PanK-II (mainly found in eukaryotes, but also in the Staphylococci) and PanK-III, also known as CoaX (found in bacteria). Eukaryotic PanK-II enzymes often occur as different isoforms, such as PanK1, PanK2, PanK3 and PanK4. In humans, multiple PanK isoforms are expressed by four genes. PANK1 gene encodes the PanK1α and PanK1β forms, and PANK2 and PANK3 encode PanK2 and PanK3, respectively.  Structure   PanK-II  Fig. 1 Dimer structure of PanK-II PanK-II contains two protein domains, as illustrated in Figure 1. The A domain and A' domain each has a glycine-rich loop (sequence GXXXXGKS; P loop) that is characteristic of nucleotide-binding sites; this is where ATP is assumed to bind. located between residues 95 and 102 on the A domain The two ATP binding sites display cooperative behavior. The dimerization interface consists of two long helices, one from each monomer, that interact with each other. The C-terminal ends of the helices are held together by van der Waals interactions between valine and methionine residues of each monomer. The middle of the helices is attached by hydrogen bonds between asparagine residues. At the N-terminal end, each helix widens and forms a four-helix bundle with two shorter helices. This bundle consists of a hydrophobic core formed by non-polar residues that utilize van der Waals forces to further stabilize the dimer. In the active site, pantothenate is oriented by hydrogen bonds between pantothenate and the side chains of aspartate, tyrosine, histidine, tyrosine, and asparagine residues. Asparagine, histidine, and arginine residues are involved in catalysis. Human PanK-II isoforms PanK1α, PanK1β, PanK2, and PanK3 have a common, highly homologous catalytic core of approximately 355 residues. PanK1α and PanK1β are both encoded by the PANK1 gene and have the same catalytic domain of 363 amino acids, encoded by exons 2 through 7. The PanK1α transcript starts with exon 1α that encodes a 184-residue regulatory domain at the N-terminus. This region allows for feedback inhibition by free CoA and acyl-CoA and regulation by acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. On the other hand, the PanK1β transcript starts with exon 1β, which produces a 10-residue N-terminus that does not include a feedback regulatory domain.  PanK-III  Fig. 2 Dimer structure of PanK- III PanK-III also contains two protein domains, and the key catalytic residues of PanK-II are conserved. The monomer units of PanK-II and PanK-III are virtually identical, but they have distinctly different dimer assemblies. A study between the structures of Staphylococcus aureus type II and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III demonstrate that the PanK-II monomer has a loop region that is absent from the PanK-III monomer, and the PanK-III monomer has a loop region that is absent from the PanK-II monomer. This minor variation has a crucial difference on the dimerization interface in which the helices of the PanK-II dimer coil around one another and the helices of the PanK-III dimer interact at a 70° angle (Figure 2). As a result of this difference in dimerization interface between PanK-II and PanK-III, the conformations of the substrate binding sites for ATP and pantothenate are also distinct.  Catalytic Mechanism  Fig. 3 Proposed catalytic mechanism for PanK-II  PanK-II  A proposed mechanism of the phosphoryl transfer reaction of PanK-II is a concerted mechanism with a dissociative transition state. First, the ATP binds at the binding groove created by residues of the P loop and nearby residues. Here, the conserved lysine (Lys-101) is the key residue required for ATP binding. Additionally, the side chains of residues Lys-101, Ser-102, Glu-199, and Arg-243 orient the nucleotide in the binding groove. The pantothenate is bound and oriented by forming hydrogen bond interactions with residues Asp-127, Tyr-240, Asn-282, Tyr-175, and His-177. When both ATP and pantothenate are bound, Asp-127 deprotonates the C1 hydroxyl group of pantothenate. The oxygen from the pantothenate then attacks the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP. Here, charge stabilization of β- and γ-phosphate groups is achieved by Arg-243, Lys-101, and a coordinated Mg2+ ion. In this concerted mechanism, the planar phosphorane of the γ-phosphate is transferred in-line to the attacking oxygen of pantothenate. Finally, 4'-phosphopantothenate dissociates from PanK, followed by ADP.  Regulation of pantothenate kinase   PanK-II  The regulation of pantothenate kinase is essential to controlling the intracellular CoA concentration. Pantothenate kinase is regulated via feedback inhibition by CoA and its thioesters (i.e., acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA). CoA inhibits PanK activity by competitively binding to the ATP binding site and preventing ATP binding to Lys-101. Although CoA binds at the same site as ATP, they bind in distinct orientations, and their adenine moieties interact with the enzyme with nonoverlapping sets of residues. His-177, Phe-247, and Arg-106 are necessary for CoA recognition but not for ATP, and while Asn-43 and His-307 interact with the adenine base of ATP, His-177 and Phe-247 interact with the adenine base of CoA. Both molecules use Lys-101 to neutralize the charge on their respective phosphodiesters. Nonesterified CoA has more potent inhibition than its thioesters. This phenomenon is best explained by the tight fit of the thiol group with the surrounding aromatic residues, Phe-244, Phe-259, Tyr-262, and Phe-252. Free CoA has an optimal fit, but when an acyl group is attached to CoA, the steric hindrance makes it difficult for the thioester to interact with Phe-252. Thus, the inhibition by thioesters is less effective than that by nonesterified CoA.  PanK-III  The regulation outlined above corresponds to PanK-II. PanK-III is resistant to feedback inhibition. Genes In humans: * PANK1, PANK2, , PANK4. The PANK2 gene encodes for PanK2, which regulates the formation of CoA in mitochondria, the cell’s energy-producing centers. PANK2 mutation is the cause of Pantothenate kinase- associated neurodegeneration, formerly called Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. This rare disease presents with profound dystonia, spasticity and is often fatal.

Bristol's part in the trade was prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries as the city's merchants used their position to gain involvement. It is estimated that over 500,000 enslaved African people were traded by Bristol merchants. Background Located on the banks of the River Avon in the South West of England, the city of Bristol has been an important location for maritime trade for centuries.E. M. Carus-Wilson, 'The overseas trade of Bristol' in E. Power & M.M. Postan, Studies in English Trade in the Fifteenth Century (London, 1933) Bristol participated in the medieval slave trade from before 1000 AD, with English and Irish slaves being traded until the 1100s. The city's involvement with the slave trade peaked between 1730 and 1745, when it became the leading slaving port. Bristol's port facilitated, and benefited from, the transport of half a million slaves. In 1750 alone, Bristol ships transported approximately 8,000 of the 20,000 enslaved Africans sent that year to the British Caribbean and North America.  Transatlantic slave trade  Bristol's entry into the slave trade The Royal African Company, a London-based trading company, had control over all trade between countries in Britain and Africa from 1672 to 1698. At this time, only ships owned by the Royal African Company could trade for anything, including slaves. Slaves were an increasingly important commodity at the time, since the British colonisation of the Caribbean and the Americas in the 17th century which necessitated cheap labour to work on Sugar, Rum, Tobacco and Cotton Plantations. The Society of Merchant Venturers, an organisation of elite merchants in Bristol, wanted to participate in the African slave trade, and after much pressure from them and other cities such as Liverpool and Hull, the Royal African Company's control over the slave trade was broken in 1698. As soon as the monopoly was broken, Bristol commenced its participation, though it is thought that illegal involvement preceded this. What is thought to have been the first \\"legitimate\\" Bristol slave ship, the Beginning, owned by Stephen Barker, purchased a cargo of enslaved Africans and delivered them to the Caribbean. Some average slave prices were £20, £50, or £100. In her will of 1693, Jane Bridges, Widow of Leigh Upon Mendip bequeathes her interest of £130 in this ship to her grandson Thomas Bridges and indicates that the vessel was owned by the City of Bristol. Due to the over-crowding and harsh conditions on the ships, it is estimated that approximately half of each cargo of slaves did not survive the trip across the Atlantic. Bristol became one of the biggest centres of the transatlantic slave trade between 1725 and 1740, when it is estimated that profits of 5-20% were made from the trading of black slaves. One estimate suggests that over 500,000 Africans were brought into slavery by Bristol traders. By the 1730s, an average of 39 slave ships left Bristol each year, and between 1739 and 1748, there were 245 slave voyages from Bristol (about 37.6% of the whole British trade). In the last years of the British slave trade, Bristol's share decreased to 62 voyages or, 3.3% of the trade in Britain – in comparison, Liverpool's share increased to 62% (1,605 voyages).  Number of enslaved African people traded  \\"Am I not a woman and a sister?\\" antislavery medallion from the late 18th century An estimated 2108 slaving ventures departed from Bristol between 1698 and 1807. The average number of enslaved people on a ship was considered to be in excess of 250. It is therefore estimated that merchants in Bristol were responsible for, in excess of, 500'000 enslaved African people being shipped to the Caribbean and North America.  Triangular trade  Depiction of the classical model of the triangular trade The triangular trade was a route taken by slave merchants between England, Northwest Africa and the Caribbean during the years 1697 to 1807. Bristol ships traded their goods for enslaved people from south-east Nigeria and Angola, which were then known as Calabar and Bonny. They exchanged goods produced in Bristol like copper and brass goods as well as gunpowder, which were offered as payment of shares in the voyages by Bristol tradesmen and manufacturers. The ships set sail to St Kitts, Barbados and Virginia to supply English colonies requiring free or cheap labour to work on sugar and tobacco plantations, with enslaved Africans. Alongside slaves, British colonies were supplied with a wide range of goods for the plantations by the Bristol ships; this included guns, agricultural implements, foodstuffs, soap, candles, ladies’ boots and 'Negro cloaths' for the enslaved, from which the British economy benefited. Some Bristol slave merchants were also importers of goods produced in the plantations. This meant that the Bristol economy was intrinsically linked to slave-produced Caribbean goods such as sugar, rum, indigo and cocoa. These goods were imported for sugar refining, tobacco processing and chocolate manufacturing; all important local industries which employed thousands of working-class people in Bristol and the surrounding areas.  Legacy   Racism  The slave trade significantly influenced the growth of racist theory as a method for society to justify itself. Stories of slave rebellions, runaways and attacks on plantation owners in the colonies were printed in the British press to perpetuate the myth that Black people were unreasonable and violent. Such narratives impacted how black people were treated in Bristol long into the 20th century. For example, in the 1960s, the Bristol Omnibus Company openly employed only white bus drivers and conductors, resulting in the Bristol Bus Boycott of 1963. A number of people impacted by the slave trade were invited back to Britain as part of the Windrush generation from 1948 onwards, and a significant number of these people settled in St. Paul's in Bristol. Members of the \\"Windrush generation\\" faced significant discrimination when they arrived in the United Kingdom from the Caribbean.  Street names, schools and public buildings  Colston Hall in Bristol Street names such as Guinea Street, Jamaica Street, Codrington Place, Tyndall's Park, Worral and Stapleton Roads are references to Bristol's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. Using the wealth generated from the slave trade, merchants invested in purchasing land, cultural buildings and upgrading ships in Bristol. The Theatre Royal in Bristol, which is the second oldest working theatre in the country, was built as a result of very wealthy subscribers (that directly or indirectly benefitted from businesses involved in the slave trade) each pledging a sum of money for the building. Some buildings and institutions such as schools were named after their slave trading benefactors; for example, Colston Hall, Colston Girls School and Colston Primary School (renamed recently to Cotham Gardens Primary School) were named after Edward Colston, a Bristol-born slave trader and member of the Royal African Company and the Merchant Venturers Society. Georgian House, Bristol was originally built for John Pinney (1740 - 1818) who owned several sugar plantations in West Indies. From 1762 - 1783, Pinney lived on Nevis, running his plantations, but in 1783 he returned to England and settled in Bristol. When Pinney moved to Bristol, he brought two black attendants with him - Fanny Coker and Pero Jones - who were both bought by Pinney in 1765. Pero was twelve years old when bought along with his two sisters, Nancy and Sheeba at six years old. There is related original documentation held by the University of Bristol library, for example, the record when Pinney bought Pero and his two sisters and proof of age when bought. Pero's Bridge is a footbridge across the River Frome which was opened in the docks of Bristol, 1999. The footbridge is named after an African slave who had been purchased by plantation owner, John Pinney who named him Pero Jones. Pero was bought to Bristol as a manservant to Pinney but his sisters, Nancy and Sheeba were left behind to work on Montravers plantation in Nevis. Pero died in 1798, aged 45 in Ashton, Bristol.  Commercial  Several Bristol banks, such as the Bristol Old Bank, were founded by prominent slave traders and merchants, such as Isaac Elton. They have amalgamated and changed names many times before becoming part of other institutions, notably NatWest. Profit and wealth Residents in Bristol could financially benefit from the slave trade in a myriad of ways. This was primarily from investing in the slave voyages, which were sometimes funded by as many as eight investors. They also benefits from industries which facilitated the slave trade, for example, employment in the production of goods that were exported to the plantations and to Africa, employment in the ships which carried enslaved Africans and local goods and, from the handling and further refinement of cargoes received from the plantations. It is estimated that by the late 1780s, Bristol earned £525,000 per year from all of these slave-related commercial activities. Since this was past the peak of Bristol's participation in the slave trade, it is likely that Bristol's earnings from the commercialisation of enslaved Africans and related activities were much higher in the earlier 18th century. Whilst the Bristol economy benefited, it was primarily the merchants that owned the ships who made significant material gains in their personal family wealth. The merchants were organised as a group in the Merchant Venturers Society. Given their status with holding leadership positions in Bristol, the Society was able to successfully oppose movements to abolish the slave trade in the late 1700s in order to maintain their power and source of wealth. The slave trade in the British Empire was abolished in 1807 however the institution itself was not outlawed until 1834. Following Britain's Slave Compensation Act of 1837, which compensated slave owners for the loss of what was considered their property, according to the Bristol Museums, plantation owners based in Bristol claimed over £500,000, equivalent to £2bn in 2020.  In popular culture  The folk duo Show of Hands have written and performed a song entitled \\"The Bristol Slaver\\" covering the subject.  Museums  M Shed in Bristol explore Bristol's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade in their 'Bristol People' gallery. It features a section on the legacies of the slave trade on some of Bristol's public institutions. It features the antislavery movement as the beginning of a display on modern public protests including the Bristol Bus Boycott, treating the abolition campaign as the start of a British tradition of society campaigning. M Shed held a workshop on Bristol and the Transatlantic slave trade from September 2019 to July 2020. This workshop encouraged students to investigate historic objects, modern attitudes and opinions and to consider how Bristol was changed by its involvement in the slave trade. M Shed also held a workshop in February 2020 on 'Slavery, public history and the British country house', outlining the historic links to slavery of many country houses in the south west of England. New Room, Bristol has an exhibition about the abolitionist John Wesley and the Methodist response to slavery.

Prior to World War II, the firm built a number of light touring and racing aircraft, the most successful of which was the SAI.7. During the war, this design served as the basis for some light fighter designs, but these did not enter mass production. Ambrosini was re-formed in 1946 and continued with the development and manufacture of the SAI.7 design, eventually producing jet fighter prototypes based on it, but these were not successful.

He was the brother of Willam Hull, another well known illustrator and watercolour painter.Houf, Simon. The Dictionary of 19th Century British Book Illustrators, p. 186 (Antique Collectors' Club Ltd, 1999) Biography Hull was born in Keysoe in Bedfordshire, England, the fourth son (and sixth child) of a farmer, James Hull, who became a Moravian missionary to Manchester. He was an engraver who also painted many watercolours and, in later life, became known as a book illustrator. He was employed from 1855 to 1861 by The Illustrated Times, a successful London weekly, and was an illustrator for several books such as Stratford on Avon by Sidney Lee (published around 1890) and The Laureate's Country (a book on Alfred Tennyson) by Alfred J. Church, published around the same time. Hull symbolises the spirit of illustration in the 19th century. The great illustrators such as Phiz (who illustrated many of Dickens's books) are well known. Hull represents the many who plied their trade in periodicals and books before the advent of photography in the early 20th century. Hull was also a wood engraver as recognised by his inclusion in Rodney Engen's Dictionary of Victorian Wood Engravers (1990). Hull lived most of his life in London. He travelled widely in England as his paintings and illustrations show. He married and had two daughters and three granddaughters. He died on 3 February 1906 and is buried in St Peters Church at Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire. The Royal Academy shows a number of Hull's paintings being exhibited there to 1874. The earliest one shown from 1827 is by another Edward Hull, a son of Thomas Henry Hull – a well-known miniaturist – and originally thought to be a relative of Edward Hull (1823–1906), but they are no longer thought to be related. The two are often confused. There is also another Edward Hull who was a furniture maker and shop owner who was a close friend of Augustus Pugin (the designer of much of the interior of the House of Commons). He also lived in London at the same time but is also not related. References Illustrated books *Church, Alfred J.

The original cathedral was built between 1019 and 1500 in Romanesque and Gothic styles. The late Romanesque building, destroyed by the 1356 Basel earthquake, was rebuilt by Johannes Gmünd, who was at the same time employed for building the Freiburg Münster. Ulrich von Ensingen, architect of the towers at the Ulm Minster and the Strasbourg Cathedral, extended the building from 1421. Hans von Nußdorf completed the southern tower in 1500. One of the main landmarks and tourist attractions of Basel, it adds definition to the cityscape with its red sandstone architecture and coloured roof tiles, its two slim towers and the cross-shaped intersection of the main roof. The Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance lists the Münster as a heritage site of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 75.  Building history   Early structures  Gallic wall near the Minster The hill on which the Minster is located today was a Celtic fortified city in the late Celtic Era in first century BC. The Gallic wall of this city was uncovered during archeological excavations in 1970. Both, the gate site and the historical run of the street, can be partly retraced. This road parted at today's position of the Minster where it is presumed there was a small temple that later was replaced by a Roman fort. The first bishop of Basel is claimed to be Justinianus 343-346 AC. The bishop's see was relocated from Augusta Raurica (today Kaiseraugst) to Minster hill during the Early Middle Ages. According to the archeologist Hans Rudolf Sennhauser this transfer presumably took place at the beginning of the 7th century under bishop Ragnacharius, a former monk of monastery Luxeuil. There is no historical evidence for the existence of a cathedral before the 9th century.  Second church structure - the Heinrich Münster  Design for organ shutters for Basel Minster by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1525–26. Holbein includes a view of the cathedral between its founders Kunigunde and Henry II.Christian Müller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; et al, Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515–1532, Munich: Prestel, 2006, , pp. 346–47. Built on the old foundations of the Haito Minster some time after the turn of the first millennium a new building in the early Romanesque style of the Ottonian period was built by order of Bishop Adalberto II (approx. 999 - 1025). Sometimes called “Adalberto Cathedral”, the three-nave cathedral is actually named after its patron Emperor Henry II, in German “Heinrich”. The cathedral is dedicated to Henry II and his wife Kunigunde. The prince-bishop governed the city as representative of the Emperor who gained possession of Basel in 1006. Excavations from 1973-1974 prove that the crypt of this building, consecrated in 1019, had not been expanded. At the end of the 11th century a tower made of light-colored limestone and molasse was erected on the western side of the building. This historic structure remains forming the bottom part of the north tower (Georgsturm) today. Heinrich Minster did not possess a tower on the south side.  Third church structure - late Romanesque  Minster plan The building as it stands today dates back for the most part to the late Romanesque building constructed in the last third of the 12th century and completed around 1225. On the foundations of the previous buildings a church with three naves and a transept was built. The western facade was finished sometime in the latter part of the 13th century. A third storey was added to Georgsturm, and the Martinsturm was started.Basel Münster website - Architecture 12th and 13th centuries accessed 29 June 2014 Even though supported by massive pillars, an earthquake in 1356 destroyed five towers, the choir and various vaults. Johannes von Gmünd, who was also the architect of Freiburg Minster, rebuilt the damaged cathedral and in 1363 the main altar was consecrated. In 1421 Ulrich von Ensingen, who constructed the towers of the minsters in Ulm and Strasbourg, began the extension of the northern tower (Georgsturm).Basel Münster website - Architecture 14th and 15th centuries accessed 4 May 2012 This phase ended in 1429. The southern tower (Martinsturm) was completed by Hans von Nussdorf on 23 July 1500. This date marks the official architectural completion of the minster. In the 15th century the major and the minor cloisters were added. The minster served as a bishop’s see until 1529 during the Reformation. Today's congregation forms part of the Evangelical-Reformed Church of the Canton Basel-Stadt. In the 19th century two major restorations took place. From 1852 until 1857 the rood screen was moved and the crypt on the western side was closed. In the 20th century the main aim of renovations has been to emphasize the late Romanesque architecture and to reverse some modifications made in the 1850s. Additionally, the floor was returned to its original level in 1975 and the crypt reopened. A workshop dedicated to taking care of the increasingly deteriorating sandstone exterior was set up in 1985.  Important historical events   Pope's Election at Basel Cathedral  Antipope Felix V In 1424, Pope Martin V informed Basel’s government that their city has been chosen to be the site of the next council. The main goal of the meetings held by Basel’s council between 1431 and 1449 was to implement a church reform. Following the orders of Pope Eugene IV, president of the council at that time, Julian Cesarini, left Basel in 1438. One year later, on 24 July 1440, Felix V was elected as a counter pope at Basel’s Münsterplatz. The German Emperor, Frederick III, arranged for the dissolution of the council in Basel because Felix V could not prevail. After the closure of the pontifical university, citizens made an effort to establish a new university. The council’s secretary, Pope Pius II, made it possible to enact the papal bull and to open the Basel University as an independent university on 4 April 1460.  Destruction of religious paintings  Iconoclasm in Zurich, 1524 During the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation, many valuable pieces of art belonging to the city of Basel and the minster were destroyed in 1528 and 1529. Numerous citizens stormed many of the churches in Basel, some of them by armed force in order to demolish religious paintings and statues. Huldrych Zwingli, an influential church reformer, condemned the worship of God in the form of pictures as idolatry. A group of 40 armed men is said to have ascended to the minster from the crowded market place at approximately 1 pm on 9 February 1529. After a first attack on the church, during which an altarpiece was tipped over and smashed, they departed for reinforcements. The chaplains took the opportunity to lock the gates of the minster. The returning mob of 200 loud and rowdy men assaulted and finally smashed through the barrier. Once inside the church they destroyed altars, crucifixes, and images of the Virgin Mary and saints. In the course of the afternoon the iconoclasm extended to other churches in Basel as well. The impressive treasure of the minster was saved and remained complete until the Canton of Basel was split into \\"half- cantons\\" in 1833. In the 1850s new stained glass windows by Franz Xaver Eggert installed.  Architecture   Georgsturm and Martinsturm  Martinsturm (62.7 m) and Georgsturm (64.2 m) The main front which points at the west is bestrided by two towers. The northern tower is called Georgsturm (64.2 m) and the southern tower is called Martinsturm (62.7 m). The towers are named after Georg and Martin, saints of the knights. Copies of both saints are portrayed by corresponding equestrian sculptures next to the main entrance upon high pilasters below the particular towers. The statue of Holy Martin originated from the year 1340; today, the archetype can be found in the Klingentalmuseum. A mechanic clock and a sundial are located above the archetype. It is remarkable that the sundial of the Basler Münster shows the “wrong time” due to the Basler Zeit. Below the Georgsturm a monumental picture (1372) can be found which shows knight Georg fighting against a remarkably small dragon. After a heavy earthquake in 1356 the Münster, which originally had five steeples, was reconstructed with only two steeples remaining. At the older Georgsturm, the lower brighter part that has remained untouched, can still be seen. In 1500 a gorgeous finial was put on top of the Martinsturm. By using the steep spiral stairs in the southern steeple it is possible to see the old church clock from 1883. The belfry is situated in between the two steeples which are connected through a gallery. Georgturm and Martinsturm can both be accessed by 242 stairs. From there one can get an overwhelming view of the city of Basel and the foothills of the Black Forest and the Jura Mountains. Both of the steeples consist of three lower, undivided storeys and several Freigeschosse. The two lower storeys are simple and block-like. The steeples’ upper storeys soar up the tracery gallery. As those were not constructed simultaneously, they differ slightly in their outer appearance. In contrast to the southern steeple, the octagonally cross-sectioned steeple and the steeple topping attach only over a rectangle storey at the northern steeple. Comparable to the Freiburger Münster, lank Fialentürme project at the corners of the octagons.  Main Porch  The benefactor Henry II at the main entrance An empty column, which originally carried a statue of the Virgin Mary, is situated between the doors of the main porch. As it is typical of many other Gothic church porches, the tympanum above is likely to have depicted the Last Judgement. Both were destroyed during the Reformation Era. In contrast, the curvatures depicting prophets and kings, roses, dancing angels and Abraham have been preserved. The benefactors Henry II and his wife, Empress Kunigunde, are portrayed left of the main porch. In the portrait, the emperor, depicted as a surprisingly young and beardless man, is carrying a church model in his arms, which identifies him as the benefactor. Only after the renovation of the exterior (1880 – 1980), the empress was given a cross as another symbol of identification. Originally, she was carrying gloves. On the right one can see the pictures of a seducer (“Prince of this World\\") and a misguided virgin. While the virgin smiles and starts to undress, toads and snakes crawl in the back of the seducer. They should embody the evil. The image dates back to roughly 1280. The statues and brickwork of the cathedral consist of red sandstone which was found in Wiesental and Degerfelden.  Uses  Coat of arms of the Diocese of Basel from 1605 Until the Reformation, Basel Minster was the church of the bishop and the main church of the Diocese of Basel, whose metropolitan bishop was the Archbishop of Besançon. The bishop’s residence and the original living quarters for the canons of the cathedral chapter were part of the Minster. From the 12th century onwards, the canons lived in their own private homes in the vicinity of the cathedral. On 9 February 1529, all religious images were removed from the cathedral and the Minster became the main congregation in the city of the Swiss Reformed Church, which has been the sole owner of the building ever since the separation of church and state. The City of Basel, however, still contributes three quarters of the building's maintenance costs. Currently the congregations of the Gellert Church and St. James Church, two other churches in Basel, also make up part of the congregation of the Minster. Regular services and special musical events take place in the church throughout the year. The church also hosts many concerts of the church choir, choral society and various other church organisations.  Burials  Tomb of Gertrude of Hohenberg In the choir passage is the sarcophagus of Queen Anne of Habsburg and her son Charles. She had married in 1245 as Gertrude of Hohenberg the future King Rudolf of Habsburg and died in 1281 in Vienna. From there, her body was transferred to Basel. The bones found in her grave (a woman, a child, a man) were transferred in 1770 to Saint Blaise Abbey, Black Forest; later on to Saint Paul's Abbey, Lavanttal. *Desiderius Erasmus *Jacob Bernoulli  Gallery  File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-044.jpg File:Münster Basel 2006 885.JPG File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-045.jpg File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-221.jpg File:Basel Münster Querschiff 3.JPG File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-071.jpg File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-077.jpg File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-074.jpg File:Basler Munster Martinsturm.JPG File:11-11-24-basel-by-ralfr-073.jpg File:Basel 2012-09-28 Mattes (180).JPG File:Basel Münster Kreuzgang 3.JPG File:Basel Muenster Kreuzgang 2008 (9).jpg File:Basler Muenster Mittelschiff.jpg References * Except for some text in the introductory paragraph, this article is a translation of the German language article.

It is housed in the Pauline Chapel (Capella Paolina), Vatican Palace, in Vatican City. This piece depicts the moment that Saul is converted to Christianity while on the road to Damascus. Pope Paul III commissioned the work for the chapel of his namesake. The chapel was built by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger in 1537 to 1538 with the patronage of Pope Paul III Farnese to serve as storage for the consecrated Host, and as the place where cardinals gather to elect a new Pope. Kuntz, \\"Designed for Ceremony,\\" 228. Description The figure of Christ is in the top left corner of the fresco. He is making a dramatic entrance into the scene, surrounded by a halo of light and a security detail of heavenly hosts. Some of these angels look on in awe and shock at the event occurring, while others act as a protective barrier between those things that are heavenly and divine and the earthly things below. A beam of light radiates from Christdown to a group of figures. This group is highly dramatized in their posing and expression. The most dramatic of these earthly figures is Saul himself. Saul has the face of an old man, though “we know and Michelangelo also knew it well that the calling of Saul on the road to Damascus occurred when he was about 30 years old.\\" Luca, \\"The Pauline Chapel,\\" 11. Saul's face reflects Michelangelo's own, who at this point was an old man also troubled by his faith. The figure of Saul represents “the human being in need of a greater light”.Luca, \\"The Pauline Chapel,\\" 12. Surrounding Saul is a triangular composition of companions that attempt to aid him as he lies recumbent on the ground. With one hand raised to shield himself from Christ, he has an expression of strange discomfort and fear. Most of the elements of this painting point towards the figure of Saul as being the main focus of the composition. The downward sloping hills, the beam of radiant light, and the groupings of the figures surrounding Saul make it clear to the viewer that he is the most important person in this figure-heavy piece. Further in the background is an outline of a city to contextualize the exact moment in which Saul is experiencing this divine intervention. On a journey to this city of Damascus in which he originally intended to arrest Christ followers, Saul was converted to Christianity. While Saul lies helpless on the ground, some of his companions begin to pull out weapons and shields as though they are evading an enemies attack. There is a tension to this scene that is only heightened by the individual expressions on each of the figures faces. The people on earth range from fearful to concerned. Even the angels above seem shaken by Christ's actions. As in most of his pieces, Michelangelo pays careful attention to anatomy, and gives great detail to the musculature and form of all the figures, whether clothed or nude. Even the horse shows some muscularity as he recedes into the background, carrying a stray figure with him. Michelangelo's sources for anatomical knowledge were live models, dissections, and sculptures from antiquity. Anatomy played a very important role in his work and can be seen playing out in the Conversion of Saul. In his later works such as the Last Judgement and also in his Conversion of Saul, the muscularity of his figures have more of a strain to them than previous pieces.Elkins, \\"Michelangelo and the Human Form,\\" 176. The muscles and anatomy seem contorted and elongated in ways that should not be natural and the figures are in impractical poses. Yet, this approach to anatomy works to enhance the drama of the piece. These poses and movements create a tension to the scene and highlight the miraculous nature of the event occurring. Restoration The work began restoration in 2002 and was finished in 2009. Methods included using a chemical solvent, ultrasonic curettes, and laser equipment.Luca, \\"The Pauline Chapel,\\" 43. Restoration efforts revealed that Michelangelo not only painted in fresco, but he also painted in mezzo fresco and a secco. Mezzo fresco is a technique in which the artist paints the final, thin layer of plaster underneath the actual painting so that paint pigments only slightly penetrate the plaster. A secco is a technique in which the artist painted on dry plaster and was able to work more quickly and correct mistakes as opposed to other methods.

He was a Member of National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Abitibi-Ouest. He has represented the Parti Québécois from 1976 to 2018. Gendron went to the Université Laval and obtained diplomas in pedagogy and administration. He was then a teacher at Cité Étudiante Polyno in La Sarre, a coordinator at the Commission scolaire Lalonde, and an education School counsellor. He was a municipal councillor from 1973 to 1976 in La Sarre and was the founder of the Education Workers Union of Northwestern Quebec in 1967. Gendron is the longest active MNA serving, as he was elected for the first time in 1976 when the Parti Québécois led by René Lévesque was elected the government for the first time. He was named the Assistant Whip and then the Minister of Public Services. After his 1981 re-election, he was named the Minister of Planning, Minister of Planning and Development and Minister of Education (1984–1985). After the Parti Québécois returned to the opposition benches after the 1985 elections, he was the Deputy Opposition House Leader from 1985 to 1987 and 1989 to 1994 and the Opposition House Leader from 1987 to 1989. He was also the critic after the 1989 elections for education, municipal and regional affairs. When the Parti Québécois returned to power in 1994 with Jacques Parizeau as their leader, he was named Minister of Natural resources and the Deputy Government House Leader. In 1996, he was named the Government Chair Caucus. He remained in that position after the 1998 elections until 2002 where he was briefly the Minister of Forest Management and rurality and then the Minister of Natural Resources. Gendron was re-elected in the 2003 and 2007 general elections and was the National Assembly's Third Vice-President (Third Deputy Speaker of the House) from 2003 to 2007. On May 9, 2007, Gendron was elected acting leader of the Parti Québécois over Marie Malavoy, following the resignation of André Boisclair.Le sauveur se sauve..., Denis Lessard, La Presse, May 10, 2007 During his tenure as acting leader, he played a major role in the adoption of the 2007 budget tabled by Liberal Finance Minister Monique Jérôme-Forget, as it was during a Liberal minority government. The Parti Québécois had requested additional funding for health, education and the regions as well as a reduction of the income tax cuts that were planned by the Liberals to be $950 million. The Liberals accepted an increase total funding of $111 million without reducing the tax cut and have increased taxes for oil and bank companies. Gendron and the PQ mentioned that the funding was not sufficient to vote for the budget, but only Gendron, House Leader Diane Lemieux and Finance critic François Legault took part of the vote in which the budget passed 46–44 on June 1, 2007. On August 20, 2007, an article from La Presse reported that Gendron would replace Diane Lemieux as the House Leader of the second opposition group when the National Assembly of Quebec resumed in October 2007.http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20070820/CPACTUALITES/70819144/6488/CPACTUALITES On October 21, 2008, Gendron was named the President of the National Assembly of Quebec, a position equivalent to Speaker in other legislatures. Initially, Maxime Arseneau was the PQ candidate for the position as well as Marc Picard for the Action démocratique du Québec and Yvon Vallières for the Liberals. After Picard and Arseneau dropped their candidacy, both opposition parties supported the nomination of Gendron. He is the first MNA from an opposition party to be named as President of the National Assembly since 1887. He would serve in that capacity until after the 2008 provincial election.

He played for Somerset and Worcestershire, as well as appearing for Glamorgan, not at the time a first-class county, in the Minor Counties Championship. He also umpired one Test match. Born in Batley, Yorkshire, Smith made his debut in May 1896, for Somerset against Gloucestershire at Bristol, but made only 8 and 0. He then had a relatively good period, his next three games (six innings) yielding 175 runs and including his only two half-centuries: 62 against Middlesex at Lord's and 54 against Sussex at Hove. His form then fell away and 12 further innings that year produced only 164 more runs. The 1896 season also saw his only bowling in first-class cricket, though he took no wickets. Smith played seven games in the middle of the 1897 season, and two more the following summer, but enjoyed no success at all, recording just 97 runs in 17 innings. His next first-class game was not until 1901, when he turned out for Worcestershire against Hampshire at Worcester, making 3 and 10. He played a handful more games for the county over the next few years, but did nothing of note other than to make his only first-class stumping. This came in his very last first-class game, against Lancashire in 1904, when in the absence of Worcestershire's usual keeper (George Gaukrodger) he played behind the stumps and accounted for Lancashire's own keeper, William Findlay. Smith played on for Glamorgan at minor-county level for a number of years, making 69 against Dorset in 1907. Three years later he once more filled in as wicket-keeper, playing against Worcestershire in a friendly match, and stumped Arthur Conway. (This match was, however, more memorable for Worcestershire slow left-armer's John Cuffe's extraordinary first-innings figures of 9–5.) He stood as an umpire six times in first-class cricket, including replacing Alfred Atfield for the fifth Test between South Africa and England at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth in 1913–14. His other games as umpire were three in the Currie Cup in 1908–09, one on Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)'s tour in 1909–10 and one final Currie Cup match as late as 1925–26, when he was 52 years old. Smith died in South Africa, in Grahamstown, Cape Province at the age of 76. Two of his relatives played first-class cricket. His brother William also played for Somerset in the 1890s, while his father John had played for Lancashire and Yorkshire in the 1860s.

He studied at Hubei Academy of Fine Arts Biography , Chambers Fine Art in China where he majored in sculpture and mastered an array of traditional styles and techniques. He graduated in 1994., designboom.com, Shi Jinsong He is particularly known for his first solo exhibition in the United States at Chambers Fine Art in New York Na Zha Baby Boutique exhibition, a series of stainless steel sculptures depicting baby accessories--rattle, cot, stroller, etc.--made from razor-sharp blades (Na Zha is a child warrior deity in Chinese mythology). He is violent and sly and flamboyantly dressed in flaming trousers with fireball feet. Today, he is associated with lottery, gambling, and the high life and is the star of a cartoon TV show. Shi Jinsong humorously depicts Na Zha in his exhibition as the “new face of Mothercare.”, Saatchi Gallery, Shi Jinsong Shi describes Na Zha as “a supernatural youthful hero who always recovers and refuses to grow up. He has three heads, nine eyes and eight arms, with blue clouds coming from his mouth, flamed wheels under his feet, and all kinds of powerful weapons in his hands. He needs only to shout for clouds to turn into rain. He cuts his own flesh and commits suicide to save his father, fights the dragon king, and overturns the universe.” This is the Na Zha portrayed in Shi's artwork., Artcat, Shi Jinsong, Ne Zha – A Child’s Boutique Chambers Fine Art described this work as a \\"dialogue, at once menacing and ironic, between the forms of mythic Chinese culture and modern day globalization\\". He returned to this theme for his Secret Book of Cool Weapons, which portrayed corporate logos such as the Nike Swoosh as martial arts weapons.Na Zha Baby Boutique , Chambers Fine Art catalogue Shi has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including Shanghai Cool: Creative Reproduction at the Shanghai Duolun Museum of Modern Art, Mahjong at Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland, Alors, La Chine? at the Pompidou Center in Paris, and Too Much Flavour at Chambers Fine Art in New York. Artistic Style Shi's main material is large amounts of stainless steel. This gives his artwork a gleaming, polished, and cold look with razor sharp edges. Shi is known for his childcare products and weaponry. In 2002, his exhibition Secret Book of Cool Weapons transformed common corporate logos into an array of ancient weaponry., Barbara Pollack, Creonn, Jinsong Shi Despite his heavy portrayal of machines in his work, Shi is not interested in modern-day machinery. Many details and additions seen on his pieces do not even offer any practical use. Shi adds his own experience and direction to his artwork, giving it a sense of rebellion and contradiction to humanity and morals. This sets his work apart from the typical art of contemporary China. Shi moved out of the explorative stage of form and language, saying that “language is of suspicious nature, especially that with characteristics such as the attractive logo of brands as seen in the commercial market.” The mechanical form depicted in Shi's artwork is a metaphor for real life experience. While Shi's work is not intended to give off a message, he observes social norms and customs with a neutral perspective and then creates a twisted analysis of it. Shi has a very broad mentality, believing that every thing has many surfaces and directions from which to view it. This includes his artistic materials such as steel and charcoal. Shi enjoys exploring different kinds of physical forces, including artificial, natural, and unnamed., Credit Suisse Today Art Award 2010 Influences Three major events had an influence on Shi's life: the radical socio-cultural transformation in China, Foucault’s madness and civilization, and the birth of his first daughter. All of these caused the artist to investigate ideas of transformation and control., designboom.com, Shi Jinsong Much of Shi’s work is a combination of mythic Chinese culture and modern day globalization., Art for the world, Shi Jinsong: The Independent Foot of Crane Recent Works Shi's solo exhibition, Penetrate (2011), was shown at Today Art Museum, Beijing. Penetrate was a large scale sculptural installation curated by art critic Karen Smith. Shi used charcoal, wood, metal, and other materials in his pieces. The giant scale and number of pieces shown in the exhibition as well as the amount of discard involved in the process of replacing new with old and the impact on the environment was all supposed to portray the excesses of modern China. The exhibition was literally a physical mass. Shi collected discarded materials and made them into his own artwork. For example, he took wooden beams from traditional architectural structures and bound them together with old tree trunks, pipes, tubes, and steel joists. The message of this piece was to be more aware of the harm we cause on a daily basis when we recklessly pursue our interests and desires without taking our impact on the environment into consideration., PENETRATE: Shi Jinsong Solo Exhibition Earlier Works Shi has been known to break away from his typical steel structures. In 2003, he presented an installation at the Centre Pompidou called A Life of Sugar. The installation was made out of caramel and sugar and designed to melt over the course of the show., Barbara Pollack, Creonn, Jinsong Shi The idea of the exhibition was to critique disposable consumer goods., Indepth Art News, ‘Shi Jinsong: Na Zha Baby Boutique Shi's Tree Motorcycles (2008) consisted of a tree for the frame and working motorcycle parts on the inside, the cool list, Tree Motorcycles by Shi Jinsong , making them drivable., Li Danni, Artzine, Shi Jinsong’s Metallic Motorcycles “I dreamt that a trunk with a big light was running on the road.” Shi Jinsong said in an interview., Li Danni, Artzine, Shi Jinsong’s Metallic Motorcycles “I just wanted to know what a big tree – which is four or five meters long – with a speed of more than 100 km per hour looks like.”, the cool list, Tree Motorcycles by Shi Jinsong Shi also created fancy metallic motorcycles to show in the 2008 Shanghai Biennale.

Founded as a forced-labor farm worked by black people enslaved by the land's white owner, it was one of the largest sugar and cotton producing plantations in Texas during the mid-19th century, as well as a local center of human trafficking. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967.  Levi Jordan  Levi Jordan, born in 1793, was a plantation owner in Union County, Arkansas, in 1848. However Jordan was not as successful as he wanted to be. It is for this reason that Jordan and 12 people he enslaved traveled to Brazoria County, Texas, in 1848. It was here that Jordan purchased of land from Samuel M. William for $4.00 an acre. Shortly thereafter, Jordan returned to Arkansas to sell his plantation. He also traveled to Louisiana, where Jordan’s daughter Emily, his son-in-law James McNeil, and his grandchildren resided, to sell that land so they could all pack up and move to Texas. Jordan wanted to develop a land that would survive many generations and “outlive” him, according to the oral history of the family. During the time that Jordan was traveling back to Arkansas and Louisiana to tie up loose ends, the 12 enslaved people that Jordan took to Texas stayed behind in order to get the land ready for development. The primary cash crops during the first period of the life of the Levi Jordan Plantation were cotton and sugar. Jordan built the largest sugar factory in the county, used by himself and neighboring planters. He also trafficked humans, importing kidnapped Africans and enslaving them to trade later. After the Civil War, workforce for the production of sugar declined. Furthermore, after the Emancipation in 1865, sugar was produced in very small quantities because Jordan could no longer enslave people to work his land. Even though sugar on the Levi Jordan Plantation declined significantly, the cotton production grew due to sharecropping. This is because in 1865, after the Emancipation, Jordan employed many of the people he formerly enslaved and their descendants as sharecroppers to work and maintain the cotton fields. thumb  Later history  After Jordan’s death in 1873, the land was split between Jordan’s grandsons’ according to his will. His granddaughter Annie McNeil Martin was cut out of the will and was not allowed on the property without the permission of Jordan’s wife, Sara Jordan. He did, however, set aside $5000 for the education of Annie’s sons’ (Jordan’s great grandsons) education. The site was owned, until 2001, by several site descendants. That year, title was transferred to the State of Texas, and it is now managed by the Texas Historical Commission as the Levi Jordan Plantation State Historic Site. A local advocacy group, the Levi Jordan Plantation Historical Society, was created in the mid-1990s, and its membership includes site descendants and other community members. This group was founded with the assistance of Kenneth L. Brown (the principal archaeological investigator) and Carol McDavid, one of his graduate students at the time. Today Brown and McDavid still work with the society, and Dr. McDavid worked with the local community to create a web site about the archaeology. The plantation house is being restored, and the site also includes slave quarters. As of November 2015, the site is only open to the public for Saturday tours.Levi Jordan Plantation State Historic Site See also *List of Texas State Historic Sites *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Brazoria County  References   External links  *Levi Jordan Plantation State Historic Site official website *The Levi Jordan Plantation Virtual Museum *Rootsweb.com: The Levi Jordan Plantation *Archaeology Magazine: article on the Levi Jordan Plantation Category:Plantations in Texas Category:Historic house museums in Texas Category:Agriculture museums in the United States Category:Museums in Brazoria County, Texas Category:Texas state historic sites Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks Category:Cotton plantations in the United States Category:Sugar plantations in Texas ","title":"Levi Jordan Plantation State Historic Site"},{"id":"10983290","text":"Sophie von Hellermann (born 1975, Munich) is an artist based in London who gained a fine art degree at the Royal College of Art.Painting Alumni Von Hellerman has shown work internationally in exhibitions including \\"Dear Painter… Paint Me\\" at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, \\"On The Ground\\" at Vilma Gold in London and \\"Post Modern\\" at Greene Naftali in New York.

Founded in 1897, it is one of New Jersey's largest environmental organizations, with 10 staffed nature centers, 34 nature preserves, and thousands of members throughout New Jersey and the world. It is an independent organization and is not affiliated with the National Audubon Society.  Activities  According to its website, the New Jersey Audubon Society, \\"fosters environmental awareness and a conservation ethic among New Jersey's citizens; protects New Jersey's birds, mammals, other animals, and plants, especially endangered and threatened species; and promotes preservation of New Jersey's valuable natural habitats.\\"NJAS: Who We Are and What We Do New Jersey Audubon carries out this mission in a number of ways. Some of its recent conservation efforts have included working together with state and federal legislators to secure funding for wildlife conservation, trying to get a moratorium passed for horseshoe crab fishing in Delaware Bay in order to reverse the recent drastic decline in red knot populations, inaugurating a network of birding and wildlife trails, and working together with sportsmen and property owners to preserve grassland habitats. In addition to its conservation efforts, New Jersey Audubon aims to educate people about New Jersey's environment. Scout groups, school groups, and children in summer day camps all have the possibility to learn more about environmental issues and wildlife native to New Jersey through programs offered at New Jersey Audubon nature centers. Meanwhile, New Jersey Audubon also offers numerous lectures, tours, and programs to help increase awareness of the natural world for adults as well. Teachers can also benefit from professional development programs sponsored by New Jersey Audubon, as well as through publications such as \\"Bridges to the Natural World\\" intended to help introduce their students to New Jersey's natural heritage. A third major focus of New Jersey Audubon's efforts lies in sponsoring research on New Jersey's environment and wildlife. Such research includes hawk watches at Montclair, Sandy Hook, and Cape May to monitor long-term trends in raptor populations, using radar and other tools to identify crucial habitat for migrating songbirds under the \\"Oases Along the Flyway\\" program, and monitoring populations of breeding bird species in the Hackensack Meadowlands. Finally, New Jersey Audubon also sponsors numerous field trips to various sites of environmental importance throughout New Jersey and beyond. Many of these trips are aimed primarily at birders, although trips focused on butterflies, dragonflies, reptiles and amphibians, hiking, canoeing, and caving, among other topics, are also offered on a regular basis. New Jersey Audubon also sponsors the annual World Series of Birding, perhaps the world's most famous birdwatching competition. Competing teams seek to find as many bird species as they can in the state of New Jersey, or a section thereof, on a Saturday in mid-May. The event also functions as a major fundraiser for New Jersey Audubon since competitors raise pledges for each bird species seen. Due to its many successes in helping preserve New Jersey's environment, as well as its efficient and effective management, New Jersey Audubon Society currently enjoys a four-star rating (the highest possible) by Charity Navigator.Charity Navigator Rating - New Jersey Audubon Society Nature Centers Cape May Bird Observatory: The Northwood Center Nature Center of Cape May The New Jersey Audubon Society operates staffed nature centers throughout New Jersey.

In 1991, Semple, along with John Freedman, discovered a T helper cell defect in patients with the bleeding disorder called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is the condition of having a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and most causes appear to be related to antibodies against platelets. Very low platelet counts can lead to a bleeding diathesis and purpura. The T cell defect was initially shown to be an exaggerated interleukin-2 response when T cells were cultured with platelets in vitro. Subsequently, this cytokine abnormality was shown by others to be responsible for many of the autoimmune mechanisms causing the disorder.). The importance of understanding the T cell defects in ITP is that novel therapies aimed at these cells may significantly benefit patients with ITP.

Each form has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. The most commonly used forms are B+ trees and ISAM. Such forms or structures are one aspect of the overall schema used by a database engine to store information. Unordered Unordered storage typically stores the records in the order they are inserted. Such storage offers good insertion efficiency (O\\\\left(1\\\\right)), but inefficient retrieval times (O\\\\left(n\\\\right)). Typically these retrieval times are better, however, as most databases use indexes on the primary keys, resulting in retrieval times of O\\\\left(\\\\log n\\\\right) or O\\\\left(1\\\\right) for keys that are the same as the database row offsets within the storage system. Ordered Ordered storage typically stores the records in order and may have to rearrange or increase the file size when a new record is inserted, resulting in lower insertion efficiency. However, ordered storage provides more efficient retrieval as the records are pre-sorted, resulting in a complexity of O\\\\left(\\\\log n\\\\right). Structured files Heap files Heap files are lists of unordered records of variable size. Although sharing a similar name, heap files are widely different from in-memory heaps. In-memory heaps are ordered, as opposed to heap files. * Simplest and most basic method ** insert efficient, with new records added at the end of the file, providing chronological order ** retrieval efficient when the handle to the memory is the address of the memory ** search inefficient, as searching has to be linear ** deletion is accomplished by marking selected records as \\"deleted\\" ** requires periodic reorganization if file is very volatile (changed frequently) * Advantages ** efficient for bulk loading data ** efficient for relatively small relations as indexing overheads are avoided ** efficient when retrievals involve large proportion of stored records * Disadvantages ** not efficient for selective retrieval using key values, especially if large ** sorting may be time-consuming ** not suitable for volatile tables Hash buckets * Hash functions calculate the address of the page in which the record is to be stored based on one or more fields in the record ** hashing functions chosen to ensure that addresses are spread evenly across the address space ** ‘occupancy’ is generally 40% to 60% of the total file size ** unique address not guaranteed so collision detection and collision resolution mechanisms are required * Open addressing * Chained/unchained overflow * Pros and cons ** efficient for exact matches on key field ** not suitable for range retrieval, which requires sequential storage ** calculates where the record is stored based on fields in the record ** hash functions ensure even spread of data ** collisions are possible, so collision detection and restoration is required B+ trees These are the most commonly used in practice. * Time taken to access any record is the same because the same number of nodes is searched * Index is a full index so data file does not have to be ordered * Pros and cons ** versatile data structure – sequential as well as random access ** access is fast ** supports exact, range, part key and pattern matches efficiently. ** volatile files are handled efficiently because index is dynamic – expands and contracts as table grows and shrinks ** less well suited to relatively stable files – in this case, ISAM is more efficient Data orientation Most conventional relational databases use \\"row-oriented\\" storage, meaning that all data associated with a given row is stored together. By contrast, column- oriented DBMS store all data from a given column together in order to more quickly serve data warehouse-style queries.

Life and career Griffith was born in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. She began modeling as a child, doing runway work and catalogue ads, and progressed from there to television commercials. From there, she got her first guest-starring role on the Australian medical drama Children's Hospital, and won her first film role, as Mercia in the 1998 film 15 Amore. Shortly thereafter, she won ModelQuest98's Grand Final for the 12-to-15 division, and was cast as \\"Jack\\" in the science fiction film Pitch Black. Griffith continued to act throughout her teenage years, balancing her career with schooling. She starred in Desperately Seeking Brandi, a short film that was broadcast on the Nike website to coincide with the 2000 Sydney Olympic games. Her costars in the film were Brandi Chastain and Oliver Ackland. That same year, she was also a guest-star on the Australian comedy TV series Backberner. In 2001, she starred in the short film Search by director Hannah Hilliard. In 2002, she did a three-month guest-star stint on the popular Australian soap opera Home & Away and then guest-starred on an episode of the crime drama White Collar Blue. 2003 saw her appearing in a music video by rocker Ben Lee, called \\"Running With Scissors,\\" directed by Nash Edgerton. In 2004 she reprised her role as \\"Jack\\" from Pitch Black in the anime The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. She also auditioned to play the role in the feature film sequel to Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick. Her casting was backed by producer and star Vin Diesel, but Griffith was told she had to \\"toughen up\\" for the role. Despite enlisting the aid of a kick-boxing trainer, she had only three weeks to prepare, and the role eventually went to Alexa Davalos. 2004 also saw Griffith embark upon her art career in earnest, with two major solo gallery showings. Her first, Chrysalis, was held at the Tighes Hill Gallery in Newcastle, Australia in January 2004. Her second, A Month in Kaos, was held at the Surry Hills Cafe 249 art gallery in Sydney, Australia in May 2004. Griffith also acted in another short film, A Whole New You, and guest-starred in an episode of the hit Australian medical drama All Saints. As the year came to a close, Griffith portrayed Barbarella in print and television ads promoting the Flickerfest film festival. In 2005, Griffith held her third art exhibition, a collaboration with her brother, poet Damien Griffith, called Sibling Revelry. In conjunction with the art show, they released a limited-edition book of their work, pairing her paintings with his poems. Griffith also contributed to a Wearable Art Festival, and will launch a line of clothing later in 2005. She is working on her second book, a children's book, for release in late 2005, and portrayed the starring role of Clare Newell in a short film, Wrong Answer, which will be continued in the psychological thriller called Volunteer, to be directed by JD Cohen. Griffith has a daughter, Poppy, born in 2009.

In 1795 William Roxburgh published the name Stapelia adscendens for a plant found in India. He commented that the name for the plant in the Telugu language was Car-allum and that the succulent branches are edible raw, though bitter and salty. The name Caralluma was coined by Robert Brown for a new genus in an article published in 1811. At the time he only described one species in the genus, the plant that he renamed Caralluma adscendens. In 1996 Helmut Genaust published the suggestion that it was sensible to conclude that the generic name is derived from the Arabic phrase qahr al-luhum, meaning \\"wound in the flesh\\" or \\"abscess,\\" referring to the floral odour. Genaust was unaware that the genus Caralluma existed east of Palestine. He specifically ruled out its existence in India, where it was first described and named.

The Polygars of Madurai Country were instrumental in establishing administrative reforms by building irrigation projects, forts and religious institutions. The Polygars who worshipped the goddess Kali did not allow their territory to be annexed by Aurangzeb. Their wars with the British East India Company after the demise of the Madurai Nayakas is often regarded as one of the earliest struggles for Indian independence. The British hanged many and banished others to the Andaman Islands. Veerapandya Kattabomman, Maveeran Alagumuthu Kone, Puli Thevar, Dheeran Chinnamalai, Maruthanayagam Pillai,the Marudu brothers and Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy were some notable Polygars who rose up in revolt against the British rule in South India. The war against the British forces predates the Indian rebellion of 1857 in Northern India by many decades but is still largely given less importance by historians. Role The Polygar's role was to administer their Palaiyams (territories) from their fortified centres. Their chief functions were to collect taxes, maintain law and order, run the local judiciary, and maintain a battalion of troops for the king. They served as regional military and civil administrators. In turn they were to retain of the revenue collected as tax, and submit the remaining to the king's treasury. The Polygars also at times founded villages, built dams, constructed tanks and built temples. Also the rulers taxed regions according to the cultivable and fertility of the land. Often several new rainwater tanks were erected in the semi-arid tracts of western and southern Tamil Nadu. Their armed status was also to protect the civilians from robbers and dacoits who were rampant in those regions and from invading armies which often resorted to pillaging the villages and countryside. Polygar Wars The Polygar Wars were a series of wars fought by a coalition of Palaiyakkarar's against the British between 1798 and 1805. The war between the British and Veerapandiya Kattabomman is often classified as the First Polygar war (1799), while the Second Polygar War 1800–1805 against the British was fought by a much bigger coalition over the whole of western Tamil Nadu headed by Dheeran Chinnamalai and Maruthu Pandiyar brother of the Sivaganga. The Polygars often had artillery and stubbornly resisted the storming of their hill forts. The British columns were exposed throughout the operations to constant harassing attacks and had usually to cut their way through almost impenetrable jungles while being fired on from under cover on all sides. It took more than a year to suppress the rebellion completely. After a long and expensive campaign the British finally defeated the rebelling Polygars, of whom many were beheaded and hanged while others were deported to the Andaman Islands. Of the Polygars who submitted to the British, some of them were granted Zamindari status, which had only tax collection rights and disarmed them completely.

In 1782 Moses Mendelssohn's German translation of the Pentateuch had appeared. In the bi'ur or commentary which he added to this translation, he dwelt on the beauty of the Hebrew language, its wealth of imagery, and its adaptability for poetic expression. By his comments on scripture, also, he largely stimulated Hebrew, grammatical, and exegetic studies. The seeds he thus scattered bore fruit even in his lifetime. While reading and discussing Mendelssohn's scriptural expositions, Isaac Abraham Euchel and Mendel Bresslau, who were at that time tutoring in the house of David Friedländer at Königsberg, conceived the idea of causing Hebrew as a literary language to be used more widely among the Jews. Assured of the material support of Simon and Samuel Friedländer, they issued in the spring of 1783 an appeal to all Jews to assist in establishing a society for the study of Hebrew (Chebrat Doreshe Leshon 'Eber). The periodical Ha-Me'assef was projected as a rallying-point for all those who were interested in and able to contribute to the work. The undertaking met with a cordial reception in many quarters, especially in Berlin. Mendelssohn and even the aged Naphtali Herz Wessely promised their support and contributed to Ha-Me'assef, the former anonymously. The first number of the periodical was announced April 13, 1783, in a prospectus, Nachal ha-Besor, signed by Euchel, Bresslau, and Samuel and Simon Friedländer. The first volume appeared in 1784, being the earliest successful periodical published in Hebrew. The first three volumes were issued in monthly numbers at Königsberg (the frontispiece to vol. iii being Naphtali Herz Wessely's portrait); vols. iv-vi appeared in quarterly numbers at Königsberg and Berlin; vol. vii (one number only) at Breslau; vol. viii at Berlin; the first two numbers of vol. ix at Altona, and the last two at Dessau; vol. x (two numbers only) also at Dessau. The new Collector (Achare ha-Me'assef or Ha-Me'assef he- Chadash), edited by S. Cohen, may be regarded as a continuation of Ha- Me'assef. Vol. i appeared at Berlin in 1809; vol. ii at Altona in 1810; and vol. iii at Dessau in 1811. In addition to articles on Hebrew prose and poetry, Ha-Me'assef printed general scientific articles, papers on mathematics and natural science, biographies of eminent Hebrew scholars, and articles on the history of the Roman emperors. Responsa on religious questions, e.g., on the speedy burial of the dead, have also been collected in its pages. The attitude of Ha-Me'assef was by turns Orthodox or Reform, according to the views of the collaborator. It was often very aggressive toward the strictly Orthodox view, although Wessely had from the very beginning advised a purely objective point of view. The principal collaborators on Ha-Me'assef were: *Judah Ben Zeeb *Bras *Mendel Bresslau *Cohen *Dessau *Isaac Abraham Euchel *Franco-Mendez *Friedländer *David Friedrichsfeld *Herz *Joseph Hirsch *Baruch Lindau *Joel Löwe *Löwisohn *Moses Mendelssohn *Naphtali Herz Wessely * *Witzhausen *Aaron Wolfsohn.

In 1994 he completed his studies at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden under Prof. Ralf Kerbach. In 2003 Knobloch received the Vattenfall Europe art award. In 2005 he among others represented Germany at the Prague Biennale.http://www.praguebiennale.org/newgermanpainting.htm Knobloch is represented by Galerie Gebr.

Once his attention is attracted, the painter cautiously becomes involved with the motif. Often he returns to vary the focus or perspective of the scene. Hereby, his sight is distant, neutral, but not without sympathy. The constant review of his and our perception of what we call reality adds an observative character to his work. This becomes evident especially in works in which Knobloch depicts an identical scene more than once, but from only slightly modified perspectives. The impression of a filmic sequence is generated. Yet, Knobloch’s works do not allow the audience to make up a story, which develops logically according to cause and effect. His works appear to be oddly disconnected, deposed of the temporary. By detracting the scene from a temporal sequence, and by this means from any narrative context, Knobloch directs the perception of the audience onto the artwork itself. In most cases, he puts everyday items in the centre of his work. In doing so, the visible is not deposed of its seemingly vacuity. The power of these works comes from the intense uneventfulness of the seen. The audience is bound to fill the silence with its own memory. Thus Knobloch achieves to evoke poetic associations, and this is where the quality of his works lies. His works are not about subjective experience, but about reflection.

High-level platforms and a pedestrian bridge were added during the late-20th Century. Northport station features two large parking lots. One south of the tracks and the biggest is north of the tracks. A pedestrian bridge is set up between the lots. It is wide enough for the after mentioned south platform to be constructed. Northport is one of the most elaborate LIRR stations. the current station is just east of the Northport Spur, which branched off the main and headed north to the seaport village of Northport, even though the Northport station is in East Northport. The spur has not seen a passenger train since 1899. Afterward, the spur was entirely used for freight service. freight service ended in 1978. The track lay abandoned until 1985, when it was torn up in preparation for the unbuilt Babylon Northport Expressway. In 2018, the LIRR completed an extensive rehabilitation of the station building, installing brick-paver walkways, new windows, a renovated waiting room, and new signage. Station layout This station has one 12-car-long high-level side platform to the north of the track. East of the station, on the other side of Larkfield Road, is a siding to allow trains to pass each other. The siding converges at DUKE interlocking and the two switches are maintained by two light signals next to the them. A second platform, for an extension of the siding, or a full second track, was originally planned for the station. The pedestrian bridge is wide enough for this extra construction, and the bridge's stairway on the far side of the station has a landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform, symmetrical with the landing on the other side which is part of the existing platform.

This photograph won the Kobal Photographic Portrait Award in 1998.Life through a lens, Royal College of Art biography From High Art to High Rise: Making Modern Masterpieces , National Gallery Of the photograph, which was shot with a large-format camera and printed using the Ilfochrome process, Hunter said: > I just wanted to take a picture showing the dignity of squatter life – a > piece of propaganda to save my neighbourhood....The great thing is, the > picture got a dialogue going with the council – and we managed to save the > houses. While praising both the National Gallery exhibition as a whole and several of the photographs within it, Tim Adams criticized a staged photograph, comparing it unfavorably with the work of Richard Billingham or Graham Smith. In 2010 Hunter screened A Palace for Us, a film he made about the elderly residents of public buildings in Woodberry Down, Manor House, London. Jonathan Jones described it as a 'magical' work of contemporary art that chronicled the postwar ambition to provide housing for the working class.Tom Hunter: A Palace for Us – review, The Guardian, 9 December 2010 He works at the Photography and the Archive Research Centre in London. In 2019 Hunter showed a series of photographs at Hastings Museum and Art Gallery, of taxi drivers from various other countries that had made Hastings their home, along with works from the museum's collection.

Wiesbaden: F. A. Brockhaus, 1973, p. 464. was an officer of the Hellenic Army who played an important role during the Greek Resistance.  Early life and career  Sarafis was born at Trikala in 1890 and studied law in the University of Athens. During the Balkan Wars, he enlisted in the Greek Army as a sergeant and was promoted to lieutenant in 1913. He became a Venizelist and played an active role in the various military conspiracies that were formed during the troubled 1920s. He participated in the two failed Venizelist coup attempts of 1933 and 1935. The latter was led by Nikolaos Plastiras and intended to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Panagis Tsaldaris. The failure of the coup resulted in the execution of its leader for treason and dishonorable discharges for several of the participants. Sarafis himself was condemned to life imprisonment but was pardoned by the government.  In internal exile  Sarafis was exiled to the island of Milos which was populated but had no connection to military activities. He was thus effectively isolated from possible contacts with active Army members. In 1938, Sarafis was introduced to Marion Pascoe, an English student of the University of Oxford who visited the island to pursue her studies of archaeology. However, her limited knowledge of the Greek language prevented her from effectively communicating with the locals. Sarafis was reportedly the only person on the island with working knowledge of the English language and volunteered to help her in communicating. Their private conversations over political beliefs and the History of Greece resulted in her lifelong interest in Greek matters. Marion later claimed to have fallen in love with Sarafis at this point.  Second World War  Marion left Greece during the Greco-Italian War. Sarafis resurfaced as a leading figure of the Greek Resistance movement. Initially in contact with the Republican EDES and EKKA movements, in March 1943 he was arrested by guerillas of the communist EAM/Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). Despite his background, a month later Sarafis joined ELAS. His motives for this have been hotly contested, but he seems to have been impressed by ELAS' strength and at least partly sympathised with its political aims. In May, he was appointed as head of its general staff. From this position, he played a crucial role during the Resistance and later during the Dekemvriana. After the military and political defeat of EAM in the Dekemvriana, he was captured and exiled to Serifos where Marion re-established correspondence with him in 1946. She had joined the League for Democracy in Greece in England, which campaigned for the release of political prisoners and reform of British policy towards Greece.  Post-war activities  Sarafis was eventually released in 1948 and married Marion in 1952. He joined the United Democratic Left at about this time. In the 1956 Greek legislative election, the United Democratic Left entered a coalition with the Republican Union, the Liberal Party (EP), the Rally of the Farmers and the Workers, National Progressive Union of the Centre and the Democratic Socialist Party. The coalition came second and managed to elect 132 MPs, while he was among them. He was a pedestrian casualty in a car accident on 31 May 1957 in Alimos, a suburb of Athens. He and his wife Marion were taking a walk when an automobile driven by a non-commissioned officer of the United States Air Force collided with them. Sarafis was killed and his wife injured. George V. Allen, the then United States Ambassador to Greece, ordered the airman to be handed to the Greek authorities for trial. The airman admitted to having been driving under the influence and having violated the speed limit. He was charged with manslaughter. However fellow politicians of the United Democratic Left strongly suspected the incident to be a \\"premedidated murder\\" and reported their suspicions to the press.

The specific name geyeri is in honor of German zoologist David Geyer (1855–1932). Description The egg-shaped-oval shell measures just . in length and in width. There are up to five whorls with deep seams. The aperture has four small protrusions (called \\"teeth\\") (on parietal one columellar and two palatal), it can also have fewer teeth. The colour of the shell is reddish-brown and the surface is shiny. The shell has regular growth striations and is almost smooth. Habitat This species lives in constantly wet, calcareous flush-fens that are fed by tufa-depositing springs. In the British Isles (Ireland and United Kingdom) it often lives in association with black bog-rush Schoenus nigricans and yellow sedge Carex viridula, in dense short grasses and sedges with little Sphagnum moss. Distribution and conservation status Vertigo geyeri is a boreo-alpine species, probably endemic to Europe. It occurs in the boreal, alpine, continental and Atlantic zones with a range extending from Ireland to Russia. Its populations are scattered and local extinctions of isolated populations can occur.

Similar in some respects to Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, the story is in fact its antithesis; Anderson sharply differs from Twain in his treatment of the \\"primitive\\" society in which the time traveller finds himself, and his assessment of a modern person's chances of survival in such a society. \\"The Man Who Came Early\\" was first published in the June 1956 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. It was reprinted in The Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction, Sixth SeriesDoubleday & Co, Inc., 1957 and the Anderson collection The Horn of Time.New American Library, 1968. In the 2010 collection Fragile and Distant Suns,Amazon, Kindle this story is included under the name \\"Early Rise\\". Plot The story is presented in the first person, related by a Saga-Age Icelander named Ospak Ulfsson. During a violent thunderstorm, an unexplained phenomenon transports the titular 20th-century American US Army MP back in time to Ospak's homestead. The American, who becomes known as Gerald \\"Samsson\\", is an engineering student drafted to serve at Keflavik during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Gerald is taken in by Ospak's family who assume him to be a shipwreck survivor. Although his engineering background gives him many ideas of how to improve life for the Icelanders (such as advanced sailing vessels), his lack of practical know-how, and his oversophisticated ideas when set against the nature of 10th-century life, lead to none of his suggestions being implemented. Knowledge of 20th-century metallurgy does not endow him with the highly specialised skill needed to work in a 10th-century smithy, and his attempt to do so ends with a costly fiasco. Also, knowing the theory of how to design a large metal bridge is not a sufficient base for constructing a small wooden bridge over a rivulet with medieval carpentry tools. There is also a whole series of misunderstandings caused by social and cultural differences. Gerald tries to tell the Icelanders that in his country there are no blood feuds because the government takes care of punishing all wrong-doers. However, his listeners have no concept of a vast impersonal government and its law-enforcement agencies; Gerald's words, when translated into concepts familiar to his listeners, are taken to mean that all law-enforcement is done by the King in person - whereupon the amused Icelanders remark that such a King would be too busy to beget an heir... And conversely, when Gerald tells that he had been a military policeman and describes the task of one, they are astonished at what they see as his foolhardy courage of \\"offending all the men in the war host\\" - since Vikings would absolutely not have tolerated the petty regulation of their dress and personal life which is common for soldiers in a 20th-century army. Then, Gerald guilelessly mentions that his family owns no land and lives in one apartment of a big house where many other families live - not realizing that he has just plunged his social status sharply down, as in this rural society a landless man is far down the scale. And when he boasts that the United States is a free society, but admits that US citizens may be called up for military service even at harvest time, his shocked hosts conclude that the US is the worst and most monstrous of tyrannies - since in their economy, calling up the farmers in harvest time would doom their families to starvation, unaware that in modern times far fewer people need to farm. Meanwhile, Gerald and his host's daughter fall in love with each other. A rival suitor from a neighboring clan, annoyed at her preference for the \\"useless\\" foreigner, insults Gerald, who then challenges him to \\"fight it out\\" - not realizing that in this society, duels between free people are fought with weapons and often to the death, and that fighting bare-handed \\"is for slaves\\". Trapped in a holmgang and about to be cut down, he uses his gun and kills his opponent, which is deemed dishonorable and thus not protected as a lawful killing during the duel. In order to avert his host becoming entangled in a blood feud, Gerald departs on his own - which leads to his being outlawed and hunted down. When making his last stand, his ammunition runs out (\\"his magical weapon failed him\\" as the locals see it) but he gives a good account of himself with a sword seized from a fallen opponent before being finally killed. The ending of the story suggests that, in time, Gerald's burial barrow would come to be regarded as the tomb of \\"an ancient hero\\" and that he would in death find the place in Icelandic society which he did not gain in life.

It is situated in the Waldviertel region on the river Thaya, directly on the border with the Czech Republic. The Thaya valley is protected as a national park, adjacent to the Podyjí National Park on the Czech shore. Since 1975 the municipality comprises the Katastralgemeinden of Hardegg, Felling, Heufurth, Mallersbach, Merkersdorf, Niederfladnitz, Pleissing, Riegersburg, Umlauf (unpopulated, is entirely located within the Thayatal national park and comprises a mere 12 fishermen's huts), and Waschbach. Hardegg is often referred to as \\"Austria's smallest city\\": for historical reasons, the municipality has city status (), but Hardegg proper only has 78 inhabitants. History Hardegg Castle in the March of Austria was first mentioned in an 1145 deed, it was acquired by the Counts of Plain about 1187. Hardegg itself is first documented as a town in 1290. Located on the border with the Kingdom of Bohemia, the area was devastated during the Hussite Wars in 1425. In 1483 Hardegg was bequeathed to the Habsburg archdukes of Austria. Emperor Maximilian I granted Hardegg to his ministeriales of the Prueschenk noble family and elevated them to immediate Counts of Hardegg in 1499. Two years later Count Ulrich purchased the Bohemian County of Kladsko from the Dukes of Münsterberg. From the Thirty Years' War onwards the castle decayed, until it was acquired by the Khevenhüller dynasty and rebuilt in the late 19th century according to plans designed by Carl Gangolf Kayser. Thaya bridge After World War II until the fall of the Iron Curtain, Hardegg was particularly isolated. The only connection to the Czech Republic is via a bridge built in 1874 across the Thaya to the neighbouring village of Čížov (part of the Horní Břečkov municipality) in Moravia. Economy and infrastructure The town's remote situation was also mirrored in a decreasing number of inhabitants. Its only positive economical factor today is tourism. The highest population ever officially recorded was in 1890 — a total of 3,209. Ever since, except for the period between 1939 and 1951, the number of inhabitants has been steadily decreasing. This is typical for the Hollabrunn district which has had no population increase since 1980. In 2001 there were 56 non-agricultural businesses, according to a 1999 census there were 108 farmsteads and forestral businesses. In 2001 the number of economically active persons was 597, the employment ratio was at 40.8%. In Riegerburg there is a former coal mine and Felling is the seat of RM Austria – Perlmuttdesign, Austria's last mother of pearl turnery. In Mallersbach and Niederfladnitz, kaolinite was mined. Parish church and ossuary Hardegg town and castle in winter, viewed from the Czech side of the Thaya river After the seasonal opening of the Thaya bridge border crossing from Hardegg to Čížov on 12 April 1990, the crossing point was opened hourly throughout the year for pedestrians, cyclists and skiers on 9 May 2006. In July the crossing Felling to Podmyče was opened to pedestrians and cyclists. After the expansion of the European Union's Schengen Area, the border may now be crossed anywhere at any time and formal checkpoints are obsolete. Politics As of 2010, Heribert Donnerbauer of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) is the town's mayor. The council comprises 19 seats divided as follows after the 14 March 2010 elections: ÖVP 15, SPÖ 4.

The majority of its inhabitants are black Africans. Its main language is Portuguese. Its median religion is Roman Catholicism, but only about 40% of the inhabitants are Christian. It has a rich history in the areas of arts, cuisine, and entertainment. People The main ethnic groups in Mozambique are Makhuwa, Tsonga, Makonde, Shangaan, Shona, Sena, Ndau, and other indigenous groups. There are approximately 45,000 Europeans, and 15,000 South Asians. The main religious groups in Mozambique are Christian (57%), Muslim (20%), Indigenous African, and other beliefs. Health is an expansive concern in Mozambique. With limited resources and funds, the life prospects for Mozambicans are relatively low when placed in comparison to other nations, and comparable when compared to neighboring states. The infant mortality rate for 2016, has been calculated at 67.9/1,000. The overall life expectancy is approximately 55 years. * Workforce: Agriculture—81%; industry—6%; services—13% Languages The official language is Portuguese, English is sometimes spoken in major cities such as Maputo and Beira. According to the 2007 census, 50.4% of the national population aged 5 and older (80.8% of people living in urban areas and 36.3% in rural areas) is fluent in Portuguese, making it the most widely spoken language in the country. The other languages spoken in Mozambique include Emakhuwa (at 25.3%), Xichangana (at 10.3%), Cisena (at 7.5%), Elomwe (at 7%), Echuwabo (at 5.1%), and a variety of other languages. Religion and education Most of the people in Mozambique practice native beliefs and are Christians, mostly Roman Catholics and some Protestants. Christianity is a Portuguese influence. A few Muslims (mostly Arabs and Blacks in northern part of the country), Buddhists (mostly Mahayana and Chinese), and Hindus (virtually Indian and Pakistani) are also important. Only 1/3 of Mozambicans over the age of 15 are able to read and write. Primary education in Mozambique is free. However, secondary education is not free. At the end of 1995, about 60% of primary school aged children attended Primary School. A very small percentage of these students, about 7%, move onto secondary school. At the end of the 1995 calendar year, there were approximately seven thousand students that attended one of the three higher level institutions. Media Arts The music of Mozambique can serve many purposes, ranging from religious expression to traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used in Mozambican musical expression include drums made of wood and animal skin; the lupembe, a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the marimba, which is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the Chopi of the south central coast who are famous for their musical skill and dance. Some would say that Mozambique's music is similar to reggae and West Indian calypso. Other music types are popular in Mozambique like marrabenta, and other Lusophone music forms like fado, samba, bossa nova, and maxixe (with origins from Maxixe and Kizomba). The Makonde are renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks that are commonly used in ritual dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings. Shetani (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy ebony, tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The ujamaa are totem-type carvings which illustrate lifelike faces of people and various figures. These sculptures are usually referred to as “family trees” because they tell stories of many generations. During the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art reflected the oppression by the colonial power, and became symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter Malangatana Ngwenya and the sculptor Alberto Chissano. Also a lot of the post-independence art during the 1980s and 1990s reflect the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation, and struggle. Dances are usually intricate, highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country perform a traditional dance called tufo, to celebrate Islamic holidays. Cuisine Mozambican cuisine is rich and varied, reflecting both its traditional roots as well as outside influences. Flavourful spicy stews eaten with rice or steamed cornmeal dough are common. With its long coastline and rich fishing presence, fish is a key part of the national diet. The country is famous for its shellfish, such as prawns and crayfish, and its combination of seafood dishes with the spicy Piri-Piri sauce (which literally translates to \\"Spicy-Spicy\\"). One particular stew that is without Portuguese influence is Matapa, which is usually made with cassava leaves, cashews, crab, shrimp and coconut milk. Another important dish is Piri piri chicken, which is grilled chicken basted in piri piri sauce and served with fries. Like its African neighbors, Mozambique is also blessed with a wide variety of fruits, including citrus produce (such as oranges and grapefruit), bananas, mangoes and coconuts which are enjoyed throughout the nation. Entertainment Football () is the most popular sport in Mozambique. The T.V. stations watched by Mozambicans are Televisão de Moçambique, YTV, , TIM and RTP África; Portuguese T.V. stations RTP Internacional, SIC Internacional, SIC Notícias, MTV Portugal, Disney Channel Portugal, SuperSport 7, TSN, and Euronews; and Brazilian T.V. stations TV Globo International and TV Record are also watched on T.V. throughout Mozambique.

But since most of the people are Bantus, most of the culture is native and for Bantus living in urban areas with some Portuguese influence. Mozambican culture influences the Portuguese culture. The music, movies (by RTP África), food, and traditions are now part of everyday lifestyles of Portugal. Spirit possession A new phenomenon of spirit possession appeared after the Mozambican Civil War. These spirits, called gamba, are identified as dead soldiers, and overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.Igreja, Victor, Beatrice Dias-Lambranca, and Annemiek Richters. (2008.)

An excerpt appeared in the July 24, 2000 issue of The New Yorker, under the title \\"Deadline: The Author's Desperate Bid to Save America's Past.\\" This exhaustively researched work (there are 63 pages of endnotes and 18 pages of references in the paperback edition) details Baker's quest to uncover the fate of thousands of books and newspapers that were replaced and often destroyed during the microfilming boom of the 1980s and 1990s. Double Fold is a controversial work and is not meant to be objective. In the preface, Baker says, \\"This isn't an impartial piece of reporting\\", (preface p. x) and The New York Times characterized the book as a \\"blistering and thoroughly idiosyncratic attack\\". Overview The term \\"double fold\\" refers to the test used by many librarians and preservation administrators to determine the brittleness and \\"usability\\" of paper. The test consists of folding down the corner of a page of a book or newspaper, then folding it back in the opposite direction--one double fold. The action is then repeated until the paper breaks or is about to break. The test yields a fold number. (In the late 1960s, preservation founding father William Barrow was fond of using a machine-run fold tester to back up his claims about the number of endangered books.) This experiment was used by library officials to identify their institution's brittle books, and, in some case, to justify withdrawing items from the shelves or replacing them with another format (most often microfilm). Baker describes the double fold test as \\"...utter horseshit and craziness. A leaf of a book is a semi-pliant mechanism. It was made for non-acute curves, not for origami.\\" (p. 157). Double Fold chapter titles include \\"Destroying to Preserve,\\" \\"It Can Be Brutal,\\" \\"Dingy, Dreary, Dog- Eared and Dead,\\" \\"Thugs and Pansies,\\" \\"3.3 Million Books, 358 Million Dollars\\" and \\"Absolute Nonsense.\\" Throughout the book, Baker argues against the destruction of books and newspapers by the institutions that, to his mind, should be held responsible for their preservation. He brings to light the tension between preservation and access: which should be the priority? Are libraries responsible for keeping books whole, for retaining books that may be in danger of falling apart, or are they mandated to do whatever is in their power to increase access to their holdings, possibly moving them to other mediums through methods such as microfilm or digitization, and sometimes destroying them in the process? Baker claims these goals need not conflict: \\"Why can't we have the benefits of the new and extravagantly expensive digital copy and keep the convenience and beauty and historical testimony of the original books resting on the shelves, where they've always been, thanks to the sweat and equity of our prescient predecessors?\\" (p. 67). Reviews and accolades Double Fold won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction in 2001, and received positive reviews from The New York Times, Salon.com, and the New York Review of Books. The Library Journal gave the book a good review, recommending it for libraries everywhere. Major themes Baker targets many established and revered institutions in Double Fold, including the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the New York Public Library. He accuses these libraries, and many others, of neglecting to preserve the world's cultural heritage (through their policies of discarding original materials once they've been microfilmed) and of creating cumbersome barriers to scholarship and research (in the form of tough-to-read and often incomplete microfilm).One example is the admission made by Library and Archives Canada regarding the records from Canada 1911 Census: \\"The creation of the microfilms was authorized in 1955 with the paper records destroyed afterwards. The microfilming of these records was not of consistent quality and therefore not all images are decipherable. Unfortunately, the destruction of the paper records means that there is no recourse when a record is unreadable.\\" , accessed 2008-01-16. Other targets of Baker's ire include the highly regarded Brittle Books Program, the United States Newspaper Program, the mass deacidification policy practiced by the Library of Congress, and the 1987 film Slow Fires: On the Preservation of the Human Record. (He calls the film \\"the most successful piece of library propaganda ever created.\\" p. 184). Baker's issue with microfilming is not so much with the process in and of itself (\\"there is nothing intrinsically wrong with microfilming...(it) can be extremely useful\\" p. 25) -- but with the disbinding (sometimes known as \\"guillotining\\") and discarding that often went hand-in-hand with the procedure. Baker laments the loss of thousands of volumes of significant 19th- and 20th-century newspapers: the Brooklyn Eagle, the New York Herald Tribune, the New York World, the Philadelphia Public Ledger, The New York Times, and many others. His other problems with microfilm include cost (\\"Compared to storing the originals in some big building, microfilming is wildly expensive\\" p. 26), the poor quality of some of the images (\\"edge-blurred, dark, gappy, with text cut off of some pages, faded to the point of illegibility on others\\" p. 14), and the sheer frustration of dealing with the technology (\\"microfilm is a brain-poaching, gorge-lifting trial to browse\\" p. 39). Thoughts about librarians and preservationists Christened the \\"Erin Brockovich of the library world\\" by The New York Times, Baker is not shy about placing blame on the custodians of the nation's heritage and intellect: \\"The library has gone astray partly because we trusted the librarians so completely.\\" (p. 104). Double Fold was viewed by many as a scathing indictment of librarians and libraries everywhere. The author takes to task many past and present prominent librarians and preservationists, including Verner Clapp, Fremont Rider, Patricia Battin, and Pamela Darling. Baker displays a particular distaste for library officials who advanced the notion that thousands upon thousands of books and newspapers were on the verge of disintegrating right before our eyes: \\"...librarians have lied shamelessly about the extent of paper's fragility, and they continue to lie about it\\" (p. 41). He argues that old books and newspapers—even those printed on acidic paper—can survive much longer than many experts predicted, and that librarians who claim otherwise were being alarmist, and were misguided in their attempts to justify getting rid of books deemed unhealthy. (A Preservation Directorate issued by the Library of Congress in May 2001 painted a different picture, stating that many modern books and newspapers printed on acidic paper were in imminent danger of decay.) Moreover, Baker claims that discarding policies at libraries were frequently the result of increasing pressure on librarians to save space on their shelves, although many were reluctant to admit that space was the critical issue. Reactions Librarians were quick to defend themselves and their profession, in journal articles and elsewhere, against Baker's accusations. The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) maintains a web page, Nicholson Baker, Reviews and Responses that compiles Letters to the Editor, Reviews of Double Fold, Interviews, and Articles in response to Baker's arguments, including a Q and A in response to the book, with questions such as \\"How accurate are Baker's claims about the durability of paper?\\" (answer: it depends) and \\"Should libraries collect and save everything published?\\" (answer: a fairly resounding \\"no\\"). In a Letter to the Editor in the New York Review of Books, Shirley K. Baker, a librarian writing on behalf of ARL, stresses that preservation decisions occur in a larger institutional context, and are concerned with more than just microfilm. She writes that \\"Despite limited budgets, the uncertainties of new technology, and other compelling institutional priorities, librarians have used the best knowledge and materials available at any given time to develop a broad array of preservation strategies.\\" In an editorial titled \\"Baker's Book Is Half-Baked,\\" published in the May 15, 2001 issue of Library Journal, Francine Fialkoff starts by stating \\"Nicholson Baker doesn't get it\\" and goes on to say that Baker ignores the fact that libraries serve people, not products: \\"However admirable his effort to preserve newspapers and books and to ensure that original copies of every publication be retained, he doesn't understand -- and perhaps never will -- that the purpose of libraries is access.\\" A month later, in the June 1, 2001 issue of Library Journal, Baker got the chance to respond to librarians in an interview with writer Andrew Richard Albanese. In the interview Baker denies charges of \\"librarian bashing\\" and points out that some reviewers of Double Fold had misrepresented his opinions. He says that librarians may be reading these misguided reviews and taking offense without having read the book itself. * \\"...I do think there have been some librarians who had a different idea of the direction libraries should go. Patricia Battin is one example. In my opinion, she hugely inflated a crisis in order to extract what was essentially disaster relief money from Congress. I don't think she acted with ill intentions, it's just that what she wanted to do resulted in the destruction of things libraries ought to be hanging onto...there were people who acted irresponsibly because they were caught up in the excitement of revolutionizing the distribution of information. And as a result things that we can never get back were destroyed.\\" (p. 103) * \\"I wanted to change the way librarians think about some of these collections and the nature of keeping things. I wanted to get the truth on the page so people could begin discussing these issues in an intelligent way. We have to learn what actually happened to these collections, so I wanted to tell the story in great detail of who did what and why. Having told that story, I would like librarians around the country to take seriously what's on their shelves.\\" (p. 104) * \\"There's an awful lot of stuff in this book. It is not the kind of fierce attack that it is being portrayed to be by the people who want to defuse it. There is a beleaguered feeling among librarians because people are assuming I'm saying things I'm actually not saying...I'm just trying to tell the history of some mistakes that we ought to be able to learn from as we go into this major phase of digital scanning.\\" (p. 104) * \\"There is nothing wrong with taking pictures of any library holding; it's what you do with the thing itself after you're done taking pictures that occupies my attention.\\" (p. 104) * \\"I really do love libraries. I want them to be funded. and I want them to have enough money to store what we want them to store and have the kind of invaluable reference services that they have offered in the past.\\" (p. 104) Later that year, Baker got another chance to respond to librarians when he was invited to speak at the annual American Library Association conference in San Francisco. He called himself a \\"library activist\\" and reiterated the need for libraries to retain last copies, as well as originals. Richard Cox, a professor and archivist from the University of Pittsburgh, was sufficiently taken aback by Double Fold that he chose to respond with a book of his own. Vandals in the Stacks: A Response to Nicholson Baker's Assault on Libraries was published in 2002. In 2000, Cox published a critique of Double Fold called \\"The Great Newspaper Caper: Backlash in the Digital Age\\" that appeared in the internet journal First Monday. Both the article and the book provide harsh criticisms of Baker's research and findings. Cox admits that Baker is \\"well-meaning\\" and that some good could come from an elevation of the public discourse about preservation issues, but he also maintains that \\"the problems are much more complex than Mr. Baker understands or cares to discuss.\\" He writes: \\"one can believe in the continuing utility of print and the value of maintaining books and some newspapers in their original condition, while recognizing that the ultimate preservation demands requires mechanisms like microfilming and digitization projects\\", and worries that Baker's focus on original formats will \\"divert the public's attention from the greater issues facing the preservation of the books, documents, newspapers, and other artifacts of the past.\\" Marlene Manoff takes Baker to task by questioning the importance of such a claim. She writes: \\"What precisely is at stake here? Why have both the scholarly and popular press recently taken this sudden interest in libraries? Why this concern for the historical record? ... Because museums also exist to preserve our cultural heritage, they have been on the receiving end of similar kinds of invective. Museums, like libraries, are adapting to transformations in the larger culture. Mass audiences and corporate sponsorship have become their primary engines of growth and survival. Museums and libraries both are wrestling with the need to democratize and to expand their audiences and to find new sources of funding. Both are exploiting new technologies to transform their internal operations and the nature of the materials and services they provide.\\" Manoff notes that \\"discarding books and newspapers, however serious a problem, is not itself the destruction of history\\" but also acknowledges that the call for libraries to take on a stronger role in preserving the historical record, and not only focus on technological trends, is a valid demand. Conclusions In 1999, Baker took matters into his own hands and founded the American Newspaper Repository in order to save some of the collections being auctioned off by the British Library. A year later he became the owner of thousands of volumes of old newspapers, including various runs of The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the New York Herald Tribune, and the New York World. In May 2004 the entire collection was moved to Duke University, where it is stored on climate- controlled shelves and looked after by the Rare Books and Special Collections division. As part of the gift agreement between the American Newspaper Repository and Duke, the collection will be kept together in perpetuity, and no disbinding or experimental deacidification will be allowed. Baker makes four recommendations in Double Fold epilogue: that libraries should be required to publish lists of discarded holdings on their websites, that the Library of Congress should fund a building that will serve as a storage repository for publications and documents not housed on-site, that some U.S. libraries should be designated with saving newspapers in bound form, and that both the U.S. Newspaper and the Brittle Books Programs should be abolished, unless they can promise that all conservation procedures will be non- destructive and that originals will be saved. Quotations * \\"We have...lost intellectual content as a direct result of our massive effort to preserve it.\\" (p. 260) * \\"The ability to summon words from distant, normally unreachable sources, which can be a fine thing for scholarship, is being linked to the compulsory removal of local physical access, which is a terrible thing for scholarship.\\" (p. 257) * \\"The truth is that certain purificationally destructive transformations of old things into new things seem to excite people -- otherwise polite, educated, law-abiding people -- and it's up to other normally polite people to try to stop them.\\" (p. 54) * \\"As a very rough, lowball guess, thirty-nine million dollars' worth of originals left our nation's libraries, thanks to federal largesse.

He chose Santa Fe with the belief that the city's artistic reputation would provide visibility to the group. Banfield led the Chorale until 1998. From 1999 to 2004 the director was Dennis Shrock, who had previously been the choral director of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic. In 2002 they started a year-round program for children (ages 7 to 14), which also holds public performances. Joshua Habermann, director (2019) The Santa Fe Desert Chorale did not have a director for their 2008 Summer season, using four prospective directors, as well as three guest conductors. Since 2009, their official director has been Joshua Habermann, who was one of the four finalists tried during the 2008 season. Habermann also directs the Dallas Symphony Chorus. During the Winter, 2011 season, the Chorale debuted a second group, named Desert Chorale II composed of students from the University of New Mexico, in addition to singers from the main group. Desert Chorale II was formed by Habermann as a means of providing training to singers outside of a university setting.  Organization  The Desert Chorale holds general concerts during Summer, and holiday concerts in December. They have recorded 13 CDs. The casting of the chorus changes yearly, with about two thirds returning on any given year. Habermann conducts auditions in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas, while some musicians send recordings.

It was first published in 2006 by Doubleday. It is the story of Alexander the Great's invasion of the Afghan kingdoms (the Afghanistan of today) in 330 BC through the eyes of Matthias (Μαντίθεος in Greek), a young soldier from Macedonia, who narrates the adventures of the Macedonian army against the Eastern warriors. Matthias fights for Alexander the Great's infantry confronting ferocious people who, determined to defend their homeland, follow tough war methods. Many pages of the book are dedicated to Alexander's army's fight against the Persian Spitamenes (Σπιταμένης in Greek), the Wolf of the Desert, whose army follows the barbarian war method contrary to their rivals who make war in array. Pressfield presents the brutalities and ferocities of both parties while he does not omit to refer to the vanity and voraciousness of Alexander the Great who in the last pages of the novel marries the Bactrian Roxanne (Ρωξάνη in Greek), daughter of Oxyartes. Having thus safeguarded his rights in the kingdoms of Orient, he sets off to conquer India crossing the mountains of Indian Caucasus. He leaves behind him many thousands of footmen and horsemen (one fifth of his army) to deter the indigenous people from possible insurrections and outbreaks within the conquered land. Plot Young Matthias from Macedonia follows his two older brothers’ example and enrolls in Alexander's cavalry together with his close friend Lygaios/Lucas (Λυγαίος in Greek).The Afghan Campaign by Steven Pressfield - Hardcover - Random House, www.randomhouse.com, accessed 1 September 2009 This special convoy departs from Tripoli, Lebanon and after 125 days of marching meets the rear of Alexander's army. The hero takes part into his first battle and is shocked by the atrocities of his adversaries and his own people as well. Noteworthy is the fact that the enemy, apart from its guerilla methods, recruits women and children to fight for their freedom. While marching, Matthias meets Shinar, an Afghan woman who, having abandoned her own people, offers her services as carrier of the Greek army's supplies. Nanguali is the barbarian warrior's code; its three elements are: honour, revenge and hospitality. Their women's honour, if blackened, could be redeemed (turn back into white) only by death. Matthias stands up to Baz, Shinar's brother, but fails to reach a compromise and is deceived by Baz, who in the end kills his sister and her baby. At the end of the story, Matthias is left with nothing – he has lost his family, friends, health and hope. Instead of returning home (his wife and son having been killed) as initially planned and having nothing to lose, he decides to follow the Greek army in its way to India. Reception The novel was well received by critics who found it a \\"vivid, compelling tale about the challenges of the war\\", and that through the characters we learn something about human nature.

Origins and background Caister is a generic title for the event, although each year's retreat conference had its own individual name, reflecting the theme of the year, and used extensively in publicity and branding. An annual logo was produced, incorporating the year's particular title, and large banners of the annual logo were made each year by ecclesiastical embroiderer Wendy Oakeshott. Although the event was organised by members of the Church of England, participants came from Anglican churches throughout the world, and also from Christian churches of other denominations. The event was of a strongly catholic character, but also attracted members of other Anglican traditions, including a strong charismatic element. The first Caister event was held in 1996, and took the name \\"The Word is Near\\". It was held at the Haven Holiday Camp in the village of Caister-on-Sea in Norfolk. Participation was restricted to those who qualified as an ordained bishop, priest, or deacon; or to those who were in training for ordination; or to members of religious communities (monks and nuns). However, from the second year onward (1997) the event was opened up to lay people as well. Attendance varied from year to year, but the retreat conference typically attracted between 500 and 1,000 participants annually.

Content of the event Bishop Lindsay Urwin leading a group session at the final Caister Conference in 2008. Each Caister retreat conference lasted for one working week, Monday to Friday, usually during 'Low Week' (the week following Easter Week). The daily timetable was always constructed around the same key events: early morning group Bible study, a mid-morning keynote address from a different guest speaker each day, a 'holy hour' at midday (of corporate silence in the presence of the blessed sacrament, concluding with benediction), a series of afternoon optional seminars (with four or five different seminars offered each afternoon), an evening sung mass with a sermon from one of the bishops in attendance, and a late evening special service, whose format varied from day to day throughout the event, but including services of reflection, of reconciliation, of healing, and of praise.Some of the content was reviewed in 2005 by the \\"Mystery Worshipper\\" team of Ship of Fools. The Bishop of Horsham, Bishop Lindsay Urwin OGS, led at least one of the key teaching elements in every Caister event. The series of events was originally proposed by a meeting of Anglo-Catholic bishops chaired by Eric Kemp, Bishop of Chichester, but Bishop Urwin was the chief proponent and key organiser of the initial Caister conference, and remained one of the principal organisers throughout the whole series of events. In each year Bishop Urwin took the key presentation role, partnered for several years with Brother Angelo SSF, a Franciscan friar, in a light-hearted double act style. Caister Taster Days From 2000 onwards a series of 'Caister Taster Days' was organised each year. Led by volunteers from the Caister organisational and liturgical teams, these were one-day conferences in regional centres, designed to reflect the style and spirit of the main Caister event. They had a two-fold function in both acting as a local reunion for regular Caister pilgrims, and also allowing new participants to experience something of the Caister routine with a view to possibly joining the following Easter's main Caister event. Event relocation A mass in progress at a relocated Caister Conference in Pakefield. Following redevelopment of the Caister site by Haven Holidays, the 2007 Caister event had to find a new home. For 2007 and 2008 it was held at Pontins Holiday Camp at Pakefield, in north Suffolk. Despite the change of venue, the event continued to make use of the \\"Caister\\" generic title, coupled with an event title for the year. That of 2007 was \\"Continuing Wonder\\". Caister 2008 took place from 31 March - 4 April on the theme of 'Resounding Joy', and keynote speakers included Bishop Gordon Mursell (Bishop of Stafford), and Mother Winsome CSMV, amongst others. A dozen active Church of England bishops were present for all or part of the event. The participation of a large number of bishops (never fewer than a dozen in any one year) was always a feature of each Caister conference. Sponsorship The Caister event benefited each year from the generous sponsorship of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament (CBS), many of whose members were also participants. The Superior-General of the Confraternity gave an annual address, and admitted new members during the conference. The events were further sponsored by the Society of the Holy Cross (SSC). All present were invited to an annual address by the Master of the Society, and there was also a private synod of priests of the Society during each conference. David Houlding, the long-serving Master of the Society, has described the Caister Conferences as \\"a real turning point\\" in the restoration of the Catholic movement in the Church of England following the divisive period surrounding the debates concerning women's ordination, in the early 1990s. Termination A group of participants in 2008. This turned out to be the final Caister Conference. Following the 2008 conference Bishop Lindsay Urwin moved from his post as Bishop of Horsham to take up new duties as Administrator of the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, in Norfolk. Having been the principal organiser, the future of the annual conference was first stated to be unclear; it was subsequently announced that there would be no Caister event in 2009. Although no formal announcement was ever made that the series of events had ended, no further conferences were organised, and the Caister Taster Days also ceased in 2010.

It is an updated form of the Qing magua, itself a more fashionable adaptation of the riding jacket once worn by Manchu horsemen. Name Tángzhuāng is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the clothes' Chinese name, written as in traditional characters and as in the simplified characters now used in mainland China. Its spelling may vary a little in other romanizations or dialects. It is also sometimes translated as a or jacket.China Daily (8 Feb 2002). Although the name of the jacket in English and Chinese suggests an origin during (or at least reference to) the Tang period of Chinese history, it was actually intended by its designers to mean a \\"Chinese\\" outfit.. In southern China and among the Chinese diaspora, dialects like Cantonese refer to ethnic Chinese—as opposed to all Chinese nationals—as \\"Tang people\\" rather than \\"Han\\". It is thus also sometimes translated as a After criticism of the misleading name appeared in various Chinese media, some of its designers and some government officials began to call the garment the \\"new tangzhuang\\" or but neither name lasted.. Instead, most Chinese people came to accept the designers' original name for the garment and some even expanded it to describe any form of traditional Chinese clothing. History Magua Delaval's 1821 portrait of Kan Gao, a Chinese worker on Cayenne, in a magua. The tangzhuang is an adaption of the Manchu \\"horse jacket\\" (magua), a waist- or three-quarter-length front-opening jacket or surcoat. This was initially worn—usually in a dark blue color—by Manchu horsemen, but became mandatory for Han officials' clothing under the Qing Empire.. Over time, it evolved from a protective apron for the changshan into an item of Chinese fashion in its own right and even a mark of imperial favor. Its use then spread among the common Han, including among the Chinese diaspora abroad. Following the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the \\"Mao suit\\" (Zhōngshān zhuāng) gradually displaced the changshan and magua in most contexts. After the fall of the Gang of Four in the late 1970s and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s, traditional clothing began to experience a revival in mainland China. Variants of the magua became noticeably more common in Chinese fashion from the mid-1990s. 2001 APEC Summit Russian and US presidents Vladimir Putin and George W. Bush in their tangzhuangs at the 2001 APEC summit in Shanghai, China In 1993, US president Bill Clinton tried to bring trade talks back on track by inviting the heads of the APEC member economies to personally attend what had until then been a ministerial conference. He requested leaders' clothes remain informal and presented each with a leather bomber jacket bearing the APEC logo as a memento. The next year, Indonesia followed suit and presented batik shirts; the world leaders then humored Suharto's request that they wear them for a group photo.. The tradition developed that the summits' hosts would present traditional and representative clothes from their cultures,. and the leaders would wear them on the last day of the conference as a show of solidarity.. Ahead of the first occasion of China's hosting the summit in 2001, state-run media acquainted the Chinese with the custom, prompting speculation as to what China's \\"traditional clothes\\" might be: Mao suits had been displaced by western-style suits; minority groups often had recognizable ethnic costumes but styles of Han clothing (hànfú) had varied from dynasty to dynasty, with the most recent Qing forms heavily influenced by the Manchus and their oppressive dress codes. Although these designs were among the 40People's Daily (21 Oct 2001). presented to the Chinese government over the span of a year, their foreign origin or political connotations. led officials to select an \\"ambiguously traditional\\" design by Shanghainese clothiers Li Jianqin. (, Lǐ Jiànqín) and Yu Ying (t s Yú Yīng) and by five others at Qinyi (t s Qínyì Fúshì). and the Shanghai Garment Group (t s Shànghǎi Fúzhuāng Jítuán).Shanghai Garment Group (17 July 2016).. A class of western tai chi practitioners, clad in white tangzhuangs (2005) The jackets given to the APEC leaders were a blend of Chinese motifs and western design, made from silk supposedly artificially enhanced to be stronger, softer, more wrinkle-resistant, more water-absorbent, and better ventilated, with longer-lasting and brighter colors. They featured cotton knotwork instead of buttons and a design of peonies surrounding the letters \\"APEC\\". The jackets were handmade but not personally sized; instead, they were fitted using stand-ins and body doubles, with a partially-completed backup available in case those measurements were mistaken. The leaders had a choice among scarlet, azure, green, brown, maroon, and black versions;CIIC (23 Oct 2001). each came in a matching silk bag adorned with the APEC logo and each had an off-white silk shirt to wear beneath it. The 20 attendees—the leaders of all the APEC member economies except \\"Chinese Taipei\\"—mostly opted for the red-and-black or blue-and-gold design and wore the jackets to their meetings at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum on 21 October 2001 and for the \\"Leaders' Family Portrait\\" afterwards that closed the event. Tangzhuang craze The tangzhuang's use as the representative unisex Chinese clothing for the \\"Leaders' Family Portrait\\" immediatelyPeople's Daily (25 Oct 2001). led to its more widespread popularity,. spreading from Beijing to other large towns around the country as far afield as Lanzhou in Gansu by the next Chinese New Year. This \\"tangzhuang craze\\" (t s tángzhuāng rè) saw the tangzhuang and other traditional clothes become fashionable daily wear for both sexes, which gave a large boost to the domestic silk industry. The original designers left their original companies to start their own businesses to capitalize on their creation's popularity, but the fad was short-lived. and most had moved on by 2004. Subsequent history Shinzo Abe, Vladimir Putin, and others in the 2014 version of the tangzhuang Hong Kong politician Regina Ip at the Chinese New Year fair in Victoria Park (2009) Even after the end of its fad, the tangzhuang continues to have a place in Chinese fashion. It remained in common use among Jiang Zemin's clique and the nouveau riche, but more especially became a menswear staple on the mainland and abroad for traditional Chinese holidays. alongside western and Mao-style suits.. The tangzhuang—and its perceived inauthenticity as ethnic clothing—is also credited by members of the hanfu movement with having inspired their cause and a revival of actual traditional Han clothing, despite the Chinese public's usual confusion about its origin.. (Traditional Chinese fashions have been so long mixed with Manchu and western elements that Tang-style robes are confused with Japanese kimonos and Ming clothes with Korean hanboks.) China used the \\"Tang suit jackets\\" again for its 2014 APEC summit, but with an updated style in maroon, green, and blue that The Guardian unflatteringly compared to Star Trek uniforms.. Style A model in a tangzhuang (2009) The APEC jackets were intended to reflect \\"both traditional Chinese flavor and modern ideals\\".Sina (21 Oct 2001). They have straight Mandarin collars, similar to those on the changshan and magua that gave the style its name. Unlike the traditional 2D \\"flat-cutting\\" píngmiàn cáijiǎn) process used to create those garments, which tends to produce a baggy and ill-fitted look, tangzhuangs are made using the 3D \\"solid-cutting\\" (t s lìtǐ cáijiǎn) process developed in Europe. In particular, they employ draping, darts, and set-in sleeves cut separately from the rest of the main garment, which give them a more fitted look than traditional Chinese designs. The original version also employed shoulder pads to give a stronger silhouette. Although the APEC jackets were pointedly made using artificial fibers,. silk tangzhuang have since outsold those made from cotton and other materials. Tangzhuang are available in a variety of colors, although the most common are red or blue. The brocade is often decorated with a repeated pattern of embroidery. Common designs involve the repetition of auspicious Chinese characters such as fú (, \\"happiness\\") or shòu (t, s, \\"longevity\\") for good luck and good wishes. Tangzhuang are usually fastened with decorative knotwork instead of buttons. Tangzhuang are usually considered menswear but they may also be worn by women, as by New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark at APEC 2001.

While there has been steady increase in film production since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, the number of films produced each year remains relatively small in comparison to what it used to be in the 1960s, and the industry remains heavily dependent on foreign funding, mainly European. The industry also remains reliant on international box office revenues due to the limited size of the domestic market. Despite that, local films have enjoyed a degree of local and international success. Ziad Doueiry's The Insult was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

History The history of film in Lebanon goes back to the 1880s. Two years after the Lumière Brothers publicly projected their first film in December 1885 (Paris, France), they began sending traveling representatives to tour different countries to show their movies. One of the cities that they visited was Lebanon's capital city, Beirut. Several years later, in 1909, the first movie theater was opened in the same city by the Pathé Frères. These events helped cultivate a film- viewing culture into the country. French Mandate A sharp increase in the number of theaters was observed between 1923–1929.Kassir, Samir. Beirut, University of California Press; First edition (15 November 2010), page 267 By the end of the 1920s, cinemas were common in Beirut, and some were used as a place for political gatherings. For example, in 1925, the Communist Party met at the Crystal Cinema in Beirut. Cinemas had become so popular that in 1931, students marched in a protest, demanding that prices of movie tickets be lowered. To compete against Hollywood, France decreed that all American films that were being imported to Lebanon be dubbed into French. The first local film, The Adventures of Elias Mabruk, was made in 1929.Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema, Scarecrow Press (11 March 2010), page xxiii It was a silent film, directed by Jordano Pidutti. Pidutti was an Italian immigrant who worked as a chauffeur for the Sursock family before devoting his life to film.

The film, which was directed by Julio De Luca and Karam Boustany, depicted the love story of a local prince who falls in love with a foreigner. The film is considered the first Arab film produced entirely in an Arab country and featuring the Lebanese dialect.Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard.

Post- Independence After Lebanon gained its independence from France, filmmakers began to examine local themes, especially rural life and folklore.Armes, Roy. Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary, page 7 During the post- independence period, Lebanon witnessed an economic boom that made its capital, Beirut, the financial center of the eastern Mediterranean. Lebanon's economic success, along with the presence of 38 banks and its open, multi-cultural and liberal society, made the country an alternative production choice to Egypt, which was at the time the center of filmmaking in the Arabic-speaking world. Additionally, \\"Lebanon had the region's best technical facilities\\" for film production.Chaudhuri, Shohini. Contemporary World Cinema: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia, page 60 Fully equipped studios were set up in 1952, such as Haroun Studio owned by Michel Haroun and Al-Arz StudioKhatib, Lina. Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond, I. B. Tauris, London 2008, page 22-23 For the first half of the twentieth century, Lebanese cinema was very closely associated with Egyptian cinema. In addition to exporting numerous Lebanese actors and actresses, such as Nour Al Hoda and Sabah, belly dancers like Badia Massabni and producers like Assia Dagher, Lebanese distributors monopolized export of Egyptian film from 1930s – 1970s. The first Lebanese film to be featured In Selection at Cannes Film Festival was Georges Nasser's Ila Ayn? in 1958.Ham, Anthony. Middle East, Lonely Planet 2012, page 411 Despite its success abroad and having been screened at numerous film festivals, such as in Moscow and Beijing, the movie theaters in Lebanon hesitated to screen the film, and it only received a limited screening in Cinema Opera. For its sixty-year anniversary, the film was screened again in its restored print version as part of the Cannes Classics events in 2017. George Nasser's work has been more appreciated in recent years, and the filmmaker, who teaches at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts has been showered with accolades, including at the Tripoli Film Festival, which was held in his honor in 2017. Co-productions with Egypt and Syria were common in this period, which was considered the \\"Golden Age\\" of the Lebanese film industry. Additionally, Lebanese producers from 1945 up to 1951 played an influential role in the first stages of production of Iraqi cinema. =The Golden Age= The film industry continued to prosper in the 1960s. After Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the film industry in Egypt in 1963, many private producers, distributors and directors, including Youssef Chahine, moved to Lebanon.Gugler, Josef. Ten Arab Filmmakers: Political Dissent and Social Critique, Indiana University Press, Bloomington 2015, page 103 The migration of film production to Beirut ushered a Golden Age, making Lebanon the film set for almost all Egyptian movies and establishing the Lebanese film industry as the second largest in the Arab world. Beirut rivaled Cairo's dominance of Arab filmmaking, and even briefly replaced it as the center for Arab filmmaking;Kiarostami, Abbas. The Cinema of North Africa and the Middle East, Wallflower Press, London 2007, page 160 however, films produced in the sixties, for the most part, lacked a sense of national identity and were merely commercial films, targeting a pan-Arab audience. For instance, Lebanese filmmaker, Mohammed Selmane made a series of Bedouin-themed films, like Bedouin in Paris (1964) and Bedouin in Rome (1965), both starring Samira Tewfik and targeting not only local but also Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Gulf audiences.Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 375 Mohamed Selmane, who was trained in Egypt and returned to Lebanon to make 30 films in 25 years, was one of the most successful directors of this period. The musicals of the Rahbani Brothers that starred Fairuz were an exception to the films that lacked a national identity. The Rahbani films were centered around nostalgic themes of life in Mount Lebanon villages.Stone, Christopher Reed. Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani Nation, pages 75–76 Nostalgia was a common theme in Lebanese film since 1929. While many films in the sixties were filmed in the Egyptian vernacular to cater to the large Egyptian market, the Rahbani films were filmed in the Lebanese dialect. The Seller of Rings (1965), set in a Maronite village and displaying folkloristic elements, was an adaption of one of their operettas to the screen. Another Rahbani film, Safar Barlik, which was set in 1912, depicted Lebanon's struggle against the Ottoman occupation. The film became a staple rerun on Lebanese television, especially on Independence Day.Frishkopf, Michael. Music and Media in the Arab World, page 98 There were other exceptions like the auteur films of George Nasser and Youssef Maalouf. Georges Nasser's second feature, The Small Stranger was also selected for Cannes in 1962. Youssef Maalouf adapted to film Kahlil Gibran's novel, The Broken Wings in 1962.Seigneurie, Ken. Standing by the Ruins: Elegiac Humanism in Wartime and Postwar Lebanon, Fordham University Press, 2011, page 97 Prints of the film The Broken Wings were believed to have been destroyed during the war, but one was found after the war stored in a church, and the film, starring stage actress Nidal Al-Askhar, was restored. Lebanon was also a filming location for international productions. For example, in 1965, Val Guest's Where the Spies Are, starring David Niven and Françoise Dorléac, was filmed in Beirut.Kassir, Debevoise, and Fisk. Beirut, page 407 Twenty-Four Hours to Kill,Twenty-Four Hours to Kill (1965) – IMDb starring Mickey Rooney, and Secret Agent Fireball, starring Richard Harrison, were also filmed in Beirut the same year. The following year in 1966, the German director, Manfred R. Köhler, filmed his film, Agent 505: Death Trap in Beirut. George Lautner's La grande sauterelle was also filmed in Beirut in 1967.La grande sauterelle (1967) – IMDb Rebus, starring Ann-Margret was filmed on location at the Casino du Liban in 1969. While Honeybaby, Honeybaby was shot in 1974 in Beirut, the producers of The Man with the Golden Gun, which was partially set in Beirut, decided not to film in the Lebanese capital due to the burgeoning political problems. In 1965, UNESCO established the Arab Cinema Liaison CenterGinsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema, Scarecrow Press (11 March 2010), page xxvii at the National Cinema Center in Beirut as a regional hub for linking cinema activities across the Arab world. Beirut hosted the first international film festival in the Arab world in 1971. Until the mid-1970s, the film industry in Lebanon was flourishing with market appeal that extended to neighboring Arabic-speaking countries.Kuhn, Anne and Radstone, Annette. The Women's Companion to International Film, page 239 Lebanon was producing \\"a string of sexually indulgent films\\" such as Cats of Hamra StreetKassir, Debevoise, and Fisk. Beirut, page 391 and The Guitar of Love in 1973, starring Georgina Rizk, the Lebanese beauty queen who won Miss Universe in 1971. In the 1970s, cinema attendance in Lebanon was the highest among Arabic-speaking countries.Armes, Roy. Third World film making and the West, page 204 Heiny Srour became not only the first Lebanese and Arab woman to have her film in competition at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but her documentary film The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived was actually the first film by any female filmmaker to be screened at the festival.Stone, Rob, with Paul Cooke, Stephanie Dennison, Alex Marlow- Mann. The Routledge Companion to World Cinema, Routledge; 1 edition (3 October 2017), page 209 Civil War Prior to the civil war, 161 films, mostly commercial melodramas, were produced in Lebanon and exported to various Arab countries, but when the civil war began, film production decreased tremendously.Hillauer, Rebecca. Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers, The American University in Cairo Press; 1 edition (2 February 2006), page 131 Despite the war, there was an \\"emergence of a new wave of Lebanese filmmakers – fostering, unusually, equal numbers of women and men\\". The female filmmakers, who emerged during this period, made highly acclaimed and internationally renowned films.Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 374 Some of the filmmakers who emerged during this period were \\"Maroun Baghdadi, Jocelyne Saab, Borhane Alaouié, Heiny Srour, Randa Chahal Sabag\\" and Jean Chamoun.Westmoreland, Mark R. \\"Post-Orientalist Aesthetics: Experimental Film and Video in Lebanon\\" In the 1970s, film themes in Lebanon were concentrated around the political conflicts that the country was undergoing. Displacement was also a recurrent theme as evident in Borhane Alaouie's Beirut, the Encounter (1981). Films of this period were characterized by a lack of closure, reflective of the seemingly endless war at the time. One of the most important directors to emerge during this period was Maroun Baghdadi. According to Lina Khatib, author of Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond, Baghdadi's films were \\"considered the cornerstone of Lebanese cinema\\". Maroun Baghdadi made Little Wars (1982) with aid provided by the American filmmaker, Francis Coppola.Kuhn, Anne and Radstone, Annette. The Women's Companion to International Film, page 239-240 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. The film also screened at New York Film Festival on 2 October 1982. Documentaries by filmmakers like Jocelyne Saab who \\"adopted a mainly journalistic style\\" also developed rapidly and successfully during this period. Lebanese and Palestinian documentaries produced in Lebanon during the 1970s caused a surge of documentary production across the Arab world. These documentaries contributed to the development of feature film production in the early eighties. Many filmmakers from this era, such as Jocelyne Saab, Jean Chamoun, Randa Chahal Sabbag, and Maroun Baghdadi settled in France due to the prolonged conflict in Lebanon.Armes, Roy. Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary, page 27 Beirut: The Last Home Movie is a 1987 documentary film that was directed by Jennifer Fox and shot on location at the historic Bustros mansion in Beirut. The documentary, which told the story of one of Lebanon's wealthiest families, was awarded the Excellence In Cinematography Award and won the Grand Jury Prize Documentary at the 1988 Sundance Film Festival. Despite the war, Lebanon submitted a film for the first time for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film when Promise of Love (1978) an Armenian-language film by Sarky Mouradian was submitted to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. In addition to the wave of festival films and documentaries, a series of commercial films, mostly mimicking action B movies from Hollywood, were made in the early 1980s. Prominent directors such as Youssef Charafeddine and Samir El-Ghoussaini aspired for escapism in their films to take their audiences out of the context of the war.Khatib, Lina. Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond, IB Tauris & Company, London 2008, page xiv, Films such as The Last Passage (1981), The Decision (1981), and The Leap of Death (1982) were popular because they depicted a society free of war where law and order actually existed. Other commercial films, like Ghazl Al-Banat, incorporated the war in the narrative. The era of commercial film production ended with the Israeli war on Lebanon. Post-War Revival After the war, Beirut reemerged as one of the centers of mass media production in the Arab world. While media production was concentrated around television, there were attempts to revive the film industry in Lebanon, especially by fresh graduates of Lebanese film schools. While filmmaking schools are a rarity in the region, by the mid-1990s, six of Beirut's universities were offering degrees in cinema and television and that attracted an influx of students from Arab countries who chose to receive some or all of their media training in Lebanon.Marks, Laura U. \\"What Is That and between Arab Women and Video? The Case of Beirut\\" Financing of film production in Lebanon in this period was mainly dependent on foreign support, both European and from the Lebanese diaspora. The civil war was a major theme for Lebanese filmmakers since 1975, and this trend continued in the early post-war era where films continued to be affected thematically by the war.Khatib, Lina. Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond, IB Tauris & Company, London 2008, page xx Films made after the war had a common theme of returning to the war setting and dealing with trauma common to post-conflict societies.Rastegar, Kamran. Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East, Oxford University Press, New York, 2015, page 155 Many films, such as Jocelyne Saab's experimental film, Once Upon a Time in Beirut, examined the destruction that was left after the war.Ginsberg, Terri and Lippard, Chris. Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema , page 310 Maroun Baghdadi's Beyrouth Hors la Vie won the Special Jury Prize at Canned in 1991.Hammond, Andrew. Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle, page 132 Other's like Jean-Claude Codsi's Histoire d'un retoure examined the issue of returning to the country after years of exile and war.Westmoreland, Mark R.\\"Post-Orientalist Aesthetics:Experimental Film and Video in Lebanon\\" In 1994, Codsi's film won the jury award at the Festival international du film Francophone de Namur in Belgium. In 1997, Youssef Chahine's French-produced film, Destiny, was shot on location in Lebanon, including the historic mountain town of in Beiteddine. While many films produced in the 1990s were hits at international festivals, Lebanese viewers were not drawn to the mainly war-themed films. An exception was West Beirut (film) (1998), which was a local and an international hit. It was not only the first Lebanese film, but also the first Arabic-language film to have general release in America.Hammond, Andrew. Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle, page 115 The film, that received worldwide attention, was the first Lebanese film that the post-war generation in Lebanon actually saw in cinemas, and it ushered a new era in Lebanese filmmaking that historian, Lina Khatib calls a renaissance.Khatib, Lina. Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond, IB Tauris & Company, London 2008, page xiv Renaissance in the 21st century A mélange of local issues and Western aesthetics characterized this period of Lebanese filmmaking. Films in this period gained domestic appeal where many films were not only commercially successful as evident in box- office sales of Bosta, Caramel, Stray Bullet, and Where Do We Go Now? but also were able to compete with imported, American films. Funding of films remained reliant on European organizations, such as Fonds Sud Cinéma in France and Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Philippe Aractingi's Bosta (film) is one of the few films that was completely funded locally. =2000s= Ghassan Salhab's Terra Incognito (2002) screened in Un Certain Regard in Cannes. In 2003, Randa Chahal's The Kite examined the issue of families separated due to the occupied territories in southern Lebanon. Her film won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Also in 2003, Georges Schoucair returned to Lebanon after studying film in France and established Abbout Productions, the country's first post-war production house, which has become Lebanon's \\"foremost production house and one of the most prominent companies for art-house films in the region\\". By 2004, film production was on the increase with four fiction and two documentaries produced.Deutsch, Andre. Variety International Film Guide Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige's The Perfect Day (2005) examined the social implications of political kidnappings that happened during the war. Ghassan Salhab's The Last Man (2006) represented the cultural memory of the war from the eyes of a vampire protagonist caught in limbo between life and death. Zozo (2005) by Josef Fares follows the life of a young boy and his journey to flee the war to Sweden.Rastegar, Kamran. Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East, Oxford University Press, New York, 2015, page 173 New themes that did not necessary deal with the issue of war emerged, like Danielle Arbid's In the Battlefields (2005) that critiqued patriarchal society. Filmmakers began to examine the postwar context rather than living in or surviving the war.Rastegar, Kamran. Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East, Oxford University Press, New York, 2015, page 164 Michel Kammoun's Falafel (2005) about disillusioned youth in post-war Beirut premiered in 2006 at Cinema Days of Beirut, a festival which was not cancelled despite the Israeli bombardment of the capital as a sign of \\"cultural resistance\\". « ring of fire » Zenar el nar by Bahij Hojeij in 2004 Short film production, especially by the graduates of the film schools in Lebanon, was also on the increase and receiving local and international attention. Hany Tamba's After Shave won the César Award for best short film in 2006.César Awards, France (2006) 2007 was an important year for Lebanese filmmaking when two female directors, Nadine Labaki and Danielle Arbid presented their films at the Cannes Film Festival. Labaki presented Caramel while Arbid presented A Lost Man. A Lost Man is possibly the most sexually graphic film ever made by an Arab director.

Some of the world's largest and most lavishly appointed yachts have Port Vauban as their home port, including Russian oil businessman Roman Abramovich's 86 m Ecstasea and his gift to fellow Russian businessman Eugene Shvidler (Le Grand Bleu). Co-founder of Microsoft Paul Allen's yacht Octopus is a regular visitor to the harbor. In the early part of the 20th century, Port Vauban also accommodated numerous seaplanes and a seaplane manufacturer. As of 2012, typical rates for a berth in Port Vauban are between €1m to €1.4m.

Her early activist experiences involved advocating for women's rights, first for sexual assault victims, then in her role as president of the Conseil du statut de la femme (1996-1998). Following that, she was a member of the Assemblée nationale du Québec (National Assembly of Quebec) (1998-2007) for nearly 10 years, under the governments of Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry. She left political life for a brief stint in the private sector. After a year with Vision Globale, she returned to public service as the director of the Office of the Mayor and president of the executive committee of the city of Montreal. In 2011, she stepped down from this position and became the president and chief executive officer of the Commission de la construction du Québec (CCQ). Biography After graduating from the Faculty of Law of the Université de Sherbrooke in 1983, she began her professional life, first through a social commitment to women's issues, with a particular focus on sexual assault victims. From 1986 to 1996, she was the coordinator and spokesperson for the Centres d’aide et de lutte contre les aggressions à caractère sexuel (CALACS) (Quebec Coalition of Sexual Assault Centres). She was the chairperson of the Sexual Assault Task Force from 1994 to 1995 and instigated a large research project on the legal treatment reserved for sexually assaulted women. She received Quebec's Prix de la justice award in 1991 for this research. In 1996, she became the youngest woman to chair Conseil du statut de la femme. She held this position until 1998, when she was elected in the riding of Bourget for the Parti Québécois. She was reelected in 2003 and 2007. Diane Lemieux was a member of the Assemblée nationale du Québec (National Assembly of Quebec) for nearly 10 years. First, under Lucien Bouchard's government, she was the minister of state for Labour and Employment from 1998 to 2001. Under Bernard Landry, she held the position of minister of state for Culture and Communications from 2001 to 2003. During this mandate, she asked the National Assembly to adopt Bill 104, an Act to amend the Charter of the French Language. Following the election of Jean Charest's government in 2003 , she sat in the opposition as chairperson of the Committee on Economy and Labour from 2003 to 2004. She became the first woman to hold the position of parliamentary leader of the official opposition from 2004 to 2007. She ended her political career as an MNA as the house leader of the second opposition group after the elections of 2007. In 2008, she worked in the private sector, where she became vice president for business development at Vision Globale, a Quebec company in the film and TV industry. A year later, she returned to public service, joining the ranks of Union Montréal, the political party of the mayor in office, Gérald Tremblay. She ran for borough councillor in Ahuntsic-Cartierville, but her bid was unsuccessful. She then held the position of director of the Office of the Mayor and president of the executive committee of the city of Montreal. In 2011, she became the first woman to hold the position of president and chief executive officer of the Commission de la construction du Québec (CCQ) . In November 2015, her mandate was renewed until 2021. Diane Lemieux arrived at the CCQ at a time of turmoil. The CCQ was on the verge of two major interventions: the abolition of union hiring and the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the construction industry. She worked to improve the integrity of the organization with an eye to contributing to the stability of the entire industry, which she explained during her testimony at the Commission sur l'octroi et la gestion des contrats publics dans l'industrie de la construction (Commission of Inquiry on the Awarding and Management of Public Contracts in the Construction Industry). In June 2012, the 600 administrative employees of the CCQ represented by the Syndicat des employés professionnels et de bureau (SEPB-Québec), who had been without a collective agreement since December 2009, went on strike. The strike lasted a little over two months. The employees were back to work on August 8, 2012 after signing a tentative agreement. In the first year of her mandate, following Bill 15 (Anti-Corruption Act), employees with investigative powers in the Commission de la construction du Québec had to be disaffiliated from the Syndicat des employés professionnels et de bureau (SEPB-Québec), affiliated to a trade union representing construction workers. This act amended section 65 of Act R-20, a change whose goal was to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. Diane Lemieux declared that this initiative was \\"unusual but necessary, in order to establish – or rather re- establish – the CCQ’s credibility and integrity\\". Employees and executives with investigative powers have considerable authority; they can, among other things, freely access all construction sites in Quebec and require any construction company to produce documents. Now affiliated with the Syndicat du personnel d’enquête de la Commission de la construction du Québec (SPECCQ), these employees signed their first collective agreement on October 30, 2014. As head of the CCQ, Diane Lemieux took on two important issues for the future of the industry which had not seen much progress until then: access for women to construction trades and the fight against intimidation on construction sites. Under her leadership, the CCQ has seen many changes, notably the establishment of the Carnet référence construction (to replace union hiring) and revised investigative methods. Diane Lemieux is also active in her immediate environment and in the business sector. She is a member of the board of directors of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and chairs the board of directors of TOHU.

United States, 403 U.S. 698 (1971), was Muhammad Ali'sThe petitioner changed his name to \\"Muhammad Ali\\" for religious reasons. \\"Cassius Clay\\" was his birth name and that was the name under which he was called for induction and later prosecuted. appeal of his conviction in 1967 for refusing to report for induction into the United States military forces during the Vietnam War. His local draft board had rejected his application for conscientious objector classification. In a unanimous 8–0 ruling (Thurgood Marshall recused himself due to his previous involvement in the case as a U.S. Department of Justice official), the United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction that had been upheld by the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court found the government had failed to properly specify why Ali's application had been denied, thereby requiring the conviction to be overturned: \\"the court said the record shows that [Ali's] beliefs are founded on tenets of the Muslim religion as he understands them.\\". Background In 1964, Ali failed the U.S. Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub-standard. With the escalation of the Vietnam War, the test standards were lowered in November 1965 and Ali was reclassified as 1-A in February 1966, which meant he was now eligible for the draft and induction into the U.S. Army. When notified of this status, he declared that he would refuse to serve in the U.S. Army and publicly considered himself a conscientious objector. Ali stated that \\"War is against the teachings of the Holy Qur'an. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger.\\" He also said \\"We are not to be the aggressor but we will defend ourselves if attacked.\\" Ali also famously said in 1966: \\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.\\" and \\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?\\" Ali appealed his local (Louisville, Kentucky) draft board's rejection of his application for conscientious objector classification. The Justice Department, in response to the State Appeal Board's referral for an advisory recommendation, concluded, contrary to a hearing officer's recommendation, that Ali's claim should be denied, and wrote that board that Ali did not meet any of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status. The Appeal Board then denied Ali's claim, but without stating its reasons. In early 1967, Ali changed his legal residence to Houston, Texas, where his appeal to be reclassified as a Muslim minister was denied 4–0 by the federal judicial district on February 20. He appeared for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces in Houston on April 28. As expected, Ali refused three times to step forward at the call of his name. An officer warned him he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called. As a result, on that same day, the New York State Athletic Commission suspended his boxing license and the World Boxing Association stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on May 8 and convicted in Houston on June 20 of the criminal offence of violating the Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted. The trial jury was composed of six men and six women, all of whom were white. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and denied the appeal on May 6, 1968. In the U.S. Supreme Court, the government conceded the invalidity of two of the grounds for denial of petitioner's claim given in its letter to the appeal board, but argued that there was factual support for the third ground. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court decision was handed down on June 28, 1971. The Supreme Court held that, since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to petitioner, and it is impossible to determine on which of the three grounds offered in the Justice Department's letter that board relied, Ali's 1967 conviction must be reversed. The Eugene Register-Guard, reporting on the Court's record, cited \\"...the boxer's beliefs 'are surely no less religiously based' than those in previous cases.\\" The Court incorporated Welsh v. United States, in which the Court \\"had ruled that moral and ethical objection to war was as valid as religious objection, thus broadening the qualifications.\\" Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong provide an account of the development of the decision in their book The Brethren. According to that account, Justice Marshall had recused himself because he had been U.S. Solicitor General when the case began, and the remaining eight justices initially voted 5 to 3 to uphold Ali's conviction. However, Justice Harlan, assigned to write the majority opinion, became convinced that Ali's claim to be a conscientious objector was sincere after reading background material on Black Muslim doctrine provided by one of his law clerks. To the contrary, Justice Harlan concluded that the claim by the Justice Department had been a misrepresentation. Harlan changed his vote, tying the vote at 4 to 4. A deadlock would have resulted in Ali being jailed for draft evasion and, since no opinions are published for deadlocked decisions, he would have never known why he had lost. A compromise proposed by Justice Stewart, in which Ali's conviction would be reversed citing a technical error by the Justice Department, gradually won unanimous assent from the eight voting justices.

Their name is taken from a dialogue in the film L.A. Confidential. The band is known for their strong DIY ethic and chaotic style and performances. They are currently signed to Holy Roar (for UK and EU releases) and Ipecac Recordings (for US and Japanese releases). The band released two albums on Hassle Records: Hysterics (2008) and the Diplo-produced Cosmology (2010). After creating in 2011 their own record label called Destination Moon, they released Eternal Youth, a compilation album of B-sides, remixes and rarities from throughout their career, and their third album Astraea, in 2012 with the first line-up change in their career. They then released two albums on Holy Roar records: Grievances (2015) and Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It (2018). History  Early years and the Mayday! label (2005-2008) Shortly before the band formed, Eva Korman (née Spence) was in a small garage band for a few months as a keyboardist. The band was looking for an aggressive vocalist to help make it a six piece band but Eva stepped up to give screaming a go. To practice she and her brother, James Spence, would scream in their parents' car, with very loud music on; the music was to help overcome their shyness. The two have collaborated in bands since they were both 13 years old. Rolo Tomassi formed in February 2005 in the town of Stocksbridge, taking their name from a concept in the 1997 neo-noir film L.A. Confidential. When Rolo Tomassi formed they sought to keep the band as DIY as possible; achieving this by hand-making their first releases and organizing many DIY shows. Eva Spence went from being the keyboardist to the vocalist after they struggled to find a singer. Not long after forming, the band had written some songs and immediately began to perform at local venues/pubs to small crowds. At this time they released some of their first material on to a 3 Track Demo CD which they could sell at the shows in which they were performing. The demo CD-R was released under James Spence's (keyboardist/vocalist) independent label which he named \\"Mayday!\\". There are eight releases under this label. After a split EP with Mirror! Mirror! (limited to 333 copies and released through Speedowax) the band signed to Holy Roar Records and released a self-titled EP featuring re-recorded songs from previous demos and EPs along with new songs. Hysterics and Cosmology (2008-2011) In June 2008, Rolo Tomassi were given a spot at Download Festival. In September they released their debut album Hysterics. Supporting this release the band opened for Pulled Apart By Horses in Britain and for Jane's Addiction in the United States. In 2009 Rolo Tomassi started their \\"Subs Club\\" series. This was a series of 7\\" vinyls singles released every three months with a cover track and remixes and a 7\\" single, Rolo Tomassi / Throats Split, jointly release with the band Throats. In February and March of that year Rolo Tomassi supported Fucked Up and The Bronx in the Shred Yr Face 2 tour. Later in this year, they performed at South by Southwest festival. This led to be an important performance in their career as they were watched by American producer Thomas Pentz, better known by his stage name Diplo, who mentioned them in a Pitchfork Media interview, when asked to name \\"One Obscure Band You Think Should Be More Popular\\". The band contacted him thinking he might do a remix for them but he responded by offering to produce their second album. The band wished to wrap their album's completion around Diplo's schedule so they wrote the album in three months. Camdem Crawl in 2010. (From left to right) Joe Nicholson, Eva Spence, Edward Dutton, James Spence and Joseph Thorpe. Towards the end of October 2009, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their second album, in a studio which James considered \\"unassuming, a well hidden and fantastic place\\". Artwork for their second album was, like that for Hysterics, designed by Simon Moody. Recording finished on 31 October and the album, titled Cosmology was released in May 2010 was released. With a hope that Cosmology was a clear and definite progression from Hysterics James Spence felt had they corrected the short-comings of their first album. Because it was not co-written by Diplo, like with his typical projects, he helped add flourishes to the album. Diplo's influence on Eve Spence's developed vocal range has been noted. Because their producer had typically worked with female solo artists such as Bonde do Rolê, M.I.A. and Santigold, he helped cross techniques from them over to Eva. Particularly with demoing songs, where the band would write a demo and give it to Eva to sing and interpret in her own room for hours. The band played on the Ronnie James Dio Stage at Download Festival and played on the NME/Radio 1 tent at Reading and Leeds in August 2010. James Spence commented on the Download show saying it was the biggest show of their career to date. In the band's blog in June 2010 it was written that there might eventually be a Discography styled release in the future which would l allows people to hear all of the band's material released before the Rolo Tomassi EP. On 7 August 2010 they played at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone, England. Throughout October and November 2010 Rolo Tomassi supported The Dillinger Escape Plan on their UK tour. On 19 December 2010, the band planned to conclude the year with a free show at the Bloomsbury Ballroom in London, which was to be filmed as part of a documentary and live recording release from the band. However, the show was cancelled due to the ill health of Eva Spence, and so a new UK Tour was announced for May. With the setting up of their own record label Destination Moon records Rolo Tomassi released Eternal Youth; an anthology of rare and non-album material including acoustic versions, remixes of their own work by various artists and a cover of Throats. This release was accompanied by a short list of tour dates across the UK in May 2011, which were confirmed to be the only tour date Rolo Tomassi would do in 2011. On 8 July 2011, Rolo Tomassi headlined the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage at Sonisphere. Rolo Tomassi expressed interest in working with Anthony Gonzalez or Kurt Ballou respectively of M83 and Converge as producers for the third album. In July James Spence said that the third album had not progressed far enough for them to search for producers. He also stated that they, as of July, they had at least two songs created, with a lyrical concept that surfaces as focuses on self-reflection. Astraea (2012–2013) Rolo Tomassi playing 2000 Trees, 2012 In an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Korman confirmed that the band were self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. Regarding the sound of the album, she said that it would be \\"more direct and heavier\\", but also noted that the band would \\"never shy away from being experimental\\". A May release date was initially projected. In early February 2012 Rolo Tomassi announced the release of a new single: \\"Old Mystics\\". The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. Release of the single was scheduled for 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing \\"Old Mystics\\" for streaming that it would probably not appear on the new album, but just be a stand-alone single. Alongside the announcement of \\"Old Mystics\\" the band also announced that they had two brand new members following the departure of Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson. Their replacements were Chris Cayford, current vocalist and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather who plays in Brontide. Eva Spence said in an interview that Joe Nicholson wanted to pursue taking a chemistry degree at university, while Joe Thorpe's departure was more to do with personal differences. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14 date tour. They also stated that they were entering the studio to record their third album in June, with an October release date expected. To support the album's October release Rolo Tomassi projected an 11 date headline tour of the United Kingdom in late October with Oathbreaker and Goodtime Boys. On 16 August 2012, the band announced that their new album would be titled Astraea, with the release date set to be 5 November. In May 2013 the band did a short British tour with Bastions, the band was noted for only costing five pound a ticket for all venues. On 31 August Rolo Tomassi headlined the first year of Bridgwater based music festival Morbid Mash Up which featured over 20 other bands. In September Rolo Tomassi performed on three out of the four dates of the Japanese touring festival Reverberation Festival. In September and October, starting just three days after their Japanese performances Rolo Tomassi completed a 13 date tour of Australia with Australian bands Totally Unicorn, Safe Hands and Stockades. It marked the first time the band had been in the country since 2010.  Grievances (2014– 2016)  Throughout most of 2014 the band was dormant in writing new songs for a fourth album to succeed Astraea. In mid September the band announced a three date tour in the UK with Brontide, their album being released next year and that they are releasing a split EP with Stockades. The group's fourth full-length album, Grievances, was released on 1 June 2015 through Holy Roar, with an American release through Ipecac. In June 2015 the band's cover for Deftones's Digital Bath was released on Kerrang!'s Ultimate Rock Heroes compilation disc.  Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It (2017– present)  In 2017 they had a minimal tour schedule which features appearances at the Two Thousand Trees and Tech Fest festivals in the UK also teased the unvealing of new material with a promotional website lovewillburyit.com. On 5 November the band released the first single from their new album \\"Rituals\\" on BBC Radio 1, with a music video accompanying it the next day. On 4 November Rolo Tomassi performed one headline show in London at the Borderline with support from label mates Conjurer. Here they performed two new songs, \\"Rituals\\" and \\"The Hollow Hour\\". In December Rolo Tomassi performed their first concerts in the United States, supporting The Number Twelve Looks Like You on their Nuclear. Sad. Nuclear. 12 year anniversary tour. Rolo Tomassi's fifth album Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It was released on 2 March 2018 on Holy Roar Records. It was recorded, like Grievances, at The Ranch in Southampton with Lewis Johns as producer. It was accompanied by a tour through the UK and Europe through March and April. The album was well received by critics, with review aggregator Metacritic giving the album a score of 92/100, making it the second highest rated album of 2018. The band has performed at a series of European festivals across the summer period, a six date UK tour in November with Blood Command and Cassus, and will be touring the US in November and December again supporting The Number Twelve Looks Like You. Eva Spence featured on The Number Twelve Looks Like You song \\"Of Fear\\" from their 2019 comeback album, Wild Gods, though in the physical album inlay she is listed under the name Eva Korman. On 8 September 2020, the band confirmed that they had ended their relationship with Holy Roar Records in light of allegations of sexual misconduct against the label's owner, Alex Fitzpatrick.  Characteristics   Musical style  Eva Korman Their music has been difficult to classify simply because of the band's resistance to being identified with one single genre. Described as \\"like a polished chrome King Crimson for the 21st Century\\" they have typically been acknowledged as being mathcore, a tag which summarises the theoretical complexity of their music, such as odd time signatures like 9/8 and 13/8 and polyrhythmic drumming. They have been identified as \\"falling somewhere between grindcore, progressive and alternative rock\\" and have been categorised as experimental rock, Nintendocore, post-metal, post-hardcore, progressive hardcore, progressive rock and screamo. The band utilises two vocalists in their music, a quality which \\"immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world\\". Eva Spence's vocal style was acknowledged by Michael Wilson of the BBC as bi-polar; swapping between \\"fragile lullabies to blood-curdling scowls\\". Her singing voice is in a soprano vocal range and has been compared to the stylings of Alison Goldfrapp of Goldfrapp and Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. Their earlier work - such as Hysterics, Cosmology and their demos and extended plays - was known for its use of jazz breakdowns and swapping chaotically between explosive mathcore, calm atmospheric experimental music and acid-jazz. Their music is also noted for sharing traits with Nintendocore for the use of 8-bit synthesizers and in terms of chaos and sound. The compilation album Eternal Youth by the band gave insight into their musical development since their inception in 2005 with their demos onto their latest b-side releases with Hassle records. Their style developed further into their pop, ambient, shoegaze and space rock elements for their third album Astraea and has been jokingly dubbed as cosmic-core. For one of the b-sides from the album - \\"Mezmerizer\\" - NME journalist Hamish MacBain classed it as a \\"space rock ballad\\". For the album, the band decided to base its name on the goddess of the same name, a reference to the Spence siblings admiration for Greek mythology and a desire to pick a title which made the album \\"sound big and like this proper body of work\\". The non-album single \\"Old Mystics\\" and the song from the album \\"The Scales of Balance\\" both make reference to the \\"Golden Age\\" declared by Astraea. In contrast to the lighter tone developed on Astraea, their fourth album Grievances frentic and dark in it composition- utilising pianos and violins for a darker character. Their fifth album Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It- described by James Spence- \\"Continues in the vein of Grievances' darkness – but shouldn't be used to judge what all our new material sounds like.\\"  Influences  Rolo Tomassi's influences are said to range through screamo, classical, jazz and progressive rock. Blood Brothers, Brian Eno, Cardiacs, jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, Converge, Goldfrapp, the Dillinger Escape Plan, King Crimson, the Locust and the Mars Volta are all considered influences on Rolo Tomassi's work. Rolo Tomassi have noted how the Dillinger Escape Plan are a huge influence on the band, with Edward Dutton in an interview saying that \\"they’re one of the few stock bands that you can draw from one of the five of us\\". The fractured structure of their songs are considered to be heavily influenced by The Mars Volta. Ryan Bird of Rock Sound cited At the Drive-In's album Relationship of Command as an influence on Rolo Tomassi's work, saying \\"opening the mainstream's mind toward fiercely confrontational, independent rock, it was unthought-of that a band like Rolo Tomassi could be successful .\\" James Spence wrote a guest blog on Clash Music writing about his interest in At The Drive-in, which began with seeing the video for \\"One Armed Scissor\\": \\"I remember being captivated by the way they played and how much the guitarist, Omar, was freaking out. Almost like he was attacking his instrument. It resonated with me somewhat and I was intrigued by it.\\" He commented further on the album's influence, noting \\"the odd sounds, the samples, the weird, almost undecipherable lyrics.\\"  Live performances  The band's members have been called \\"insane hardcore acrobats\\" for their energetic live performances. When James Spence commented on Rolo Tomassi's live performances, he stated that he felt people who didn't listen to them typically enjoyed their live performances and that \\"We just want people to enjoy us however they want to.\\" Noisey writer Hannah Ewens notes how lead singer Eva Korman embodies \\"a soft image in a hard environment\\" and notes that her movements onstage \\"while thrashing and aggressive, are balletic and graceful in their anger\\". When playing songs from their debut album Hysterics coming closer to their second album's release, they played songs from it faster than originally recorded as their musicianship had improved greatly. Because of the membership change and the wish to play older music at live performances, James Spence used guitar tablature and his own knowledge of the songs written to teach newer members Chris Cayford and Nathan Fairweather. In 2018 drummer Tom Pitts noted how the live shows were more unconventional and \\"punky\\" in the tempo of the gigs when he first joined in 2014, however the band in recent years is focused more precision and started playing with a clicker as he drums.

The group went on to release 11 singles, 4 studio albums and 2 compilation albums throughout their career. The group formed in 1998 and rose to fame by starring in their own BBC television series, Miami 7 in 1999 and have been widely referred to as inspiring a new generation of teenage TV musicals including High School Musical and Glee. Over the five years they were together, S Club 7 had four UK number-one singles, one UK number-one album, a string of hits throughout Europe, including a top ten single in the United States, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and went on to sell over 10 million albums worldwide. Their first album, S Club, had a strong 1990s pop sound, similar to many artists of their time. However, through the course of their career, their musical approach changed to a more dance and R&B; sound which is heard mostly in their final album, Seeing Double. The concept and brand of the group was created by Simon Fuller, also their manager through 19 Entertainment; they were signed to Polydor Records. S Club won two BRIT Awards in 2000 for British Breakthrough Act and in 2002, for Best British Single. In 2001, the group earned the Record of the Year award. Their song \\"Reach\\" was used in the arcade dance game EZ2Dancer in \\"EZ 2 Dancer UK Move\\". Group member Paul Cattermole departed the group in 2002 citing \\"creative differences\\", and the group changed its name from S Club 7 to simply S Club. Their second to last single reached number- five in the UK charts, and their final studio album failed to make the top ten. After Cattermole's departure, the group fought many rumours presuming that they were about to split. However, on 21 April 2003, during a live onstage performance, S Club announced that they were to disband.

Geography  Retz is located in the north western Weinviertel in Lower Austria. The municipality's area covers 45,01 km². 11.83 percent of this area is forested. Cadastral municipalities are Hofern, Kleinhöflein, Kleinriedenthal, Obernalb, Retz and Unternalb. Retz  History   Middle ages  In the area around the present-day Anger (Meadow) of Retz a village was formed, which was first mentioned in 1180 as „Rezze“ (Slavic; meaning small creek). Rudolf von Habsburg awarded Count Berthold of Rabenswalde (1278–1312) shire and sovereignty of Hardegg as a fiefdom. The count did not stay for long in Hardegg, and moved to Retz, where he founded the monastery of the Dominican Order (called Dominikanerkloster). The monastery was finished in 1295. Finally he founded the city of Retz around 1300. Around 1343 the preacher Franz von Retz was born. He reformed the Dominican Order, taught at the University of Vienna, was their Dean for five times, and also represented the university at the Council of Pisa. He died on September 8, 1427, in Vienna. In 1425, the Hussites conquered Retz (November 25), and only a few days later, Schrattenthal and Pulkau. The city was destroyed and many people were killed. A chronicle from Klosterneuburg reported of 6000 captives, among them Count Heinrich of Maidburg (Hardegg), who were led to Prague. Nearly 8000 men were said to be slain and over 30 Catholic churches destroyed. In 1431 the Hussites came to raid Retz for a second time. In 1467 the Burgerspitalkapelle (\\"Citizens' Hospital Chapel\\"), located between the Verderberhaus and the Znaimer Tor,was consecrated. It was secularized in 1783. Today it serves as a museum for the South Moravian gallery. After the reconstruction of the city Retz was conquered by Matthias Corvinus on October 10, 1486, after a six-day siege. Until 1492 Retz belonged to his dominion. During that time the city received the privileges concerning the trade of wine which were responsible for its future wealth. Also as a consequence of these privileges the huge and multi-storied wine cellar system was built. Today it is used for guided tours and serves as the location for a Christmas market during Advent.  16th and 17th century  From 1568 to 1569 the former church on the main square was transformed into the city's town hall by implementing an intermediate ceiling. In the first floor the Marienkapelle was built. The cabinetmaker Jakob Barth of Retz was working for over 30 years on the carvings. The historical Sgraffitohaus In 1576, the Sgraffitohaus was built. In 1928, the overpainted paintings were discovered and uncovered again. The Verderberhaus, built in 1583 The eye-catching Verderberhaus originates to the year 1583. It has its name from a family named Verderber which was a very wealthy family in Retz at that time. The family acquired the building in 1848. The Thirty Years' War brought destruction to the town, and also did the Swedes under Lennart Torstensson, who set up his headquarters in Schrattenthal. Between 1660 and 1670 the castle of the Suttner-Gatterburg family was built. Today it is home to the bicycle museum of Retz. During the shootings for the TV series Julia - eine außergewöhnliche Frau between 1998 and 2002, the fictional police station was situated there. In 1680 the bubonic plague came to the town. The Pestsäule on the main square still recalls this dramatic event. After 1696 it was permitted to build buildings higher than the city's defensive wall. This was the reason for the Dominican Order to increase the size of their monastery by a third story.  18th and 19th century  Parish church Saint Stephen In the years 1701 to 1713 the spire was revamped in the baroque style. Between 1721 and 1728 the church as a whole was enlarged, rebuilt, and revamped in the baroque style. The altarpiece showing Saint Stephen, painted by Leopold Kupelwieser, dates from the year 1852. The first windmill in Retz was entirely built out of wood in 1772. Later, a second windmill, built out of stone, was erected nearby. The second windmill is not used as a windmill anymore, and now serves as a residential house. In 1831 the wooden windmill was removed and a new windmill was built on the same spot. This is still one of the town's landmarks today, for it is the only fully functional windmill left in Austria. There was also a bricklayer from Lesná u Znojma (South Moravia) involved in this project. He used the knowledge he acquired to build a windmill in his hometown, which was later inherited by the son of the miller of Retz. In 1927, the windmill was shut down. Not far from the windmill the Kalvarienberg is located. It was erected in the years 1727–37 by Jakob Seer. On November 1, 1871, Retz was connected to the international railway system by the Austrian Northwestern Railway. In 1896, a Jewish house of prayer was built, which does not exist anymore. The local post office dates from the year 1897.  Politics  The town hall Mayor of the town is Helmut Koch, chief officer is Andreas Sedlmayer. In the municipal council there are 25 seats and the distribution of mandates after the municipal council election from March 6, 2005 is as follows: ÖVP 16, SPÖ 8, Greens 1, other parties no seats.  Twin cities  Retz is twinned with the following cities: * Rötz, Germany * Hainburg, Germany * Znojmo, Czech Republic  Main sights  Historical buildings  * Hauptplatz (main square) with Pranger (pillory), town hall, Verderberhaus and Sgraffitohaus.

There are 206 non-agricultural workplaces as of 2001, and 315 agricultural workplaces as of 1999. The number of gainful persons is 1,709 according to the census of 2001. The activity rate was 42.08 percent.  Transportation  Retz has a station on the Nordwestbahn, with regular scheduled traffic to Vienna but also to Znojmo in Czech Republic.  Inhabitant growth  According to the 2001 census, Retz has 4,168 inhabitants. Back in 1991, there were 4,284 inhabitants, in 1981 4,333, and 4,927 inhabitants in 1971.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and airs a country music format. Its studios are in Stockton, and its transmitter is located off South Bird Road in Vernalis, California. KAT Country often works with local charities and community organizations providing air time and fundraising opportunities. Most notably: the Make-A-Wish Foundation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Toys for Tots, the Second Harvest Food Bank, the American Cancer Society and others. The station hosts a yearly Listener Appreciation Concert. As the concert crowds have grown, the venues have been changed to accommodate the growing number of attendees. The June 2nd show at the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds hosted around 20,000 fans in Turlock, California. In 2011, the Listener Appreciation Concert was held at Weber Point Event Center on the waterfront in Stockton, California. History On April 3, 1948, the station first signed on as KBEE-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-23 It was one of the first FM stations in Central California. It was owned by The McClatchy Company, which publishes the Modesto Bee newspaper, giving the station its call sign, KBEE. A few years later, in 1951, McClatchy added an AM station, 970 KBEE. At first, both stations were simulcast. But through the late 1960s, 70s and 80s, while the AM station carried a full service middle of the road music format, KBEE-FM had a largely automated beautiful music sound. In 1992, the station was purchased by Citadel Broadcasting and moved from easy listening to a hit country format, switching call letters to KATM (soon after the calls were made available after being used by a station in Colorado for about seven years) under the helm of then Brand Manager, Scott Mahalick. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media in 2011.

It was written in DIGITAL Command Language. Origin The worm is believed to have been created by Melbourne-based hackers, the first to be created by an Australian or Australians. The Australian Federal Police thought the worm was created by two hackers who used the names Electron and Phoenix. Julian Assange may have been involved, but this has never been proven.Bernard Lagan, \\"International man of mystery,\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, 10 April 2010. Retrieved 17 March 2014.David Leigh and Luke Harding, WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy (2011) p. 42. Political message The WANK worm had a distinct political message attached, and it was the first major worm to have a political message.Dreyfus, Suelette. \\"Introduction\\", Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness, and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier, Mandarin Australia, 1997. WANK in this context stands for Worms Against Nuclear Killers. The following message appeared on infected computer's screen: {  W O R M S A G A I N S T N U C L E A R K I L L E R S _______________________________________________________________ \\\\__ ____________ _____ ________ ____ ____ __ _____/ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ /\\\\ / / / /\\\\ \\\\  \\\\ \\\\     / / / \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ / \\\\ / / / /__\\\\ \\\\  \\\\ \\\\    / / / \\\\ \\\\ \\\\/ /\\\\ \\\\/ / / ______ \\\\   \\\\ \\\\   \\\\ \\\\ / \\\\_\\\\ /__\\\\ /____/ /______\\\\ \\\\____ __\\\\  ____ _\\\\ \\\\_/ \\\\___________________________________________________/ \\\\ / \\\\ Your System Has Been Officially WANKed / \\\\_____________________________________________/ You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war. } The worm coincidentally appeared on a DECnet computer network shared between NASA and the US Department of Energy (DOE) days before the launch of a NASA space shuttle carrying the Galileo spacecraft. At the time, there were protests outside the Kennedy Space Center in Florida by anti-nuclear groups regarding the use of the plutonium-based power modules in Galileo. The protesters contended that if this shuttle blew up \\"like Challenger did\\", the plutonium spilled would cause widespread death to residents of Florida. The worm propagated through the network pseudo-randomly from one system to the other by using an algorithm which converted the victim machine's system time into a candidate target node address (composed of a DECnet Area and Node number) and subsequently attempted to exploit weakly secured accounts such as SYSTEM and DECNET that had password identical to the usernames. The worm did not attack computers within DECnet area 48, which was New Zealand. A comment inside the worm source code at the point of this branch logic indicated that New Zealand was a nuclear-free zone. New Zealand had recently forbidden U.S. nuclear-powered vessels from docking at its harbours, thus further fueling the speculation inside NASA that the worm attack was related to the anti-nuclear protest.Dreyfus 1997, Chapter 1. The line \\"You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war\\" is drawn from the lyrics of the Midnight Oil song \\"Blossom and Blood\\". Midnight Oil are an Australian rock band known for their political activism and opposition to both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The process name of the second version of the worm to be detected was \\"oilz\\", an Australian shorthand term for the band. Playful nature The DECnet network affected was jointly operated between the NASA Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) and the Department of Energy's High Energy Physics Network (HEPnet). The only separation between the networks was a prearranged division of network addresses (DECnet \\"Areas\\"). Thus, the worm, by picking a random target address, could affect both networks equally. The worm code included 100 common VAX usernames that were hard-coded into its source code. In addition to its political message, the worm contained several features of an apparently playful nature. The words \\"wank\\" and \\"wanked\\" are slang terms used in many countries to refer to masturbation. In addition, the worm contained \\"over sixty\\" randomizable messages that it would display to users, including \\"Vote anarchist\\" and \\"The FBI is watching YOU\\". The worm was also programmed to trick users into believing that files were being deleted by displaying a file deletion dialogue that could not be aborted, though no files were actually erased by the worm. anti-WANK and WANK_SHOT R. Kevin Oberman (from DOE) and John McMahon (from NASA) wrote separate versions of an anti-WANK procedure and deployed them into their respective networks. It exploited the fact that before infecting a system, WANK would check for \`NETW_(random number)\`, that is a copy of its own, in the process table. If one was found, the worm would destroy itself. When anti-WANK was run on a non-infected system, it would create a process named \`NETW_(random number)\` and just sit there. anti-WANK only worked against the earlier version of the worm, though, because the process name of the worm in a later version was changed to \`OILZ\`. Bernard Perrot of the Institut de physique nucléaire d'Orsay wrote a second program. The worm was trained to go after the RIGHTSLIST database, the list of all the people who have accounts on the computer. By renaming the database and putting a dummy database in its place, the worm would, in theory, go after the dummy, which could be designed with a hidden logic bomb. Ron Tencati, the SPAN Security Manager, obtained a copy of the French manager’s worm-killing program and gave it to McMahon, who tested it. It was then distributed to system administrators of both networks to be installed onto their computers. It still took weeks for the worm to be completely erased from the network.

Zombie first rose to fame as a member of the heavy metal band White Zombie, with whom he released four studio albums; the group disbanded in 1998. Opting to continue making music as a solo artist, Zombie began working on his debut solo studio album that would come to be known as Hellbilly Deluxe: 13 Tales of Cadaverous Cavorting Inside the Spookshow International (1998). The project became a commercial success for Zombie, entering the top five of the Billboard 200 in the United States and selling over three million copies in the United States alone. The album spawned three singles, all of which were used extensively in films and video games following their release. Zombie released remixed versions of songs from his debut studio album on American Made Music to Strip By (1999), which peaked inside the top forty in the United States. More than three years after the release of Hellbilly Deluxe, Zombie released his second studio album The Sinister Urge (2001). The album became his second top ten debut in the United States, with first week sales exceeding that if its predecessor. The album spawned one official single, though four promotional singles were released for radio airplay in the United States. He released the compilation album Past, Present & Future in 2003, composed of songs from his time with White Zombie along with music from his first two studio albums and soundtrack appearances. The album became Zombie's third to sell over one million copies worldwide, and remains his final album to do so. Zombie's third studio album, Educated Horses (2006), featured a shift in musical style and became his second to reach the top five of the Billboard 200 chart. Educated Horses sold over 500,000 copies in the United States since its release. Following the release of Educated Horses, Zombie released his first official greatest hits album, The Best of Rob Zombie (2006). The album was re-released only months later under the title The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection. He released his first live album, Zombie Live, in 2007. He officially returned to music nearly three years later with the release of his fourth studio album, Hellbilly Deluxe 2: Noble Jackals, Penny Dreadfuls and the Systematic Dehumanization of Cool (2010). It became his fourth top ten on the Billboard 200, reaching number eight on the weekly chart. The album saw a decline in sales from his previous releases, selling just over 200,000 copies in the United States. He released the Icon compilation album that same year, though it failed to chart on any chart worldwide. Zombie released his fifth studio album, Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor in 2013. The album became his fifth top ten on the Billboard 200, though went on to become his lowest selling album to date.

It is located close to the western shore of the Como arm of the lake in front of a gulf known as Zoca de l'oli, a Lombard name referring to the local small-scale production of olive oil. In the late 6th century (c. 587) the island was a remaining Roman stronghold under Francio, a subordinate of Narses; though the areas surrounding Lake Como were entirely controlled by the Lombards. The island was besieged for a good deal of time by the Lombards under Authari who released Francio to flee back to Narses' capital at Ravenna.Paul The Deacon - History of the Longobards - Book III - Chapter XXVII The Lombards found the island to contain \\"many riches\\" deposited for safekeeping by local Roman loyalists. The island was invaded in 1169 by Frederick Barbarossa and soldiers from the town of Como.http://www.albergolavedo.com/Isola_Comacina_En.html In 1175, Vidulfo, the Bishop of Como, cursed the island with the following words, \\"The bells will never ring, the rocks will never be placed one over the other, nobody will do here the work of the publican, the punishment a violent death.\\" In 1919 the island was given to Belgium, in homage to King Albert I. The island was returned the following year. Pietro Lingeri built three houses on the island in 1939. His idea was to turn the island into a colony for artists. The houses were built in a rationalist style, made from local materials and without much decoration.http://www.isola-comacina.it/en/the-island/art/ The island now consists of a restaurant, cafe, a collection of archaeological sites and the three artist houses.

She is primarily known for being the first woman to have written a futurist manifesto, but was also active in Parisian salons, and the associated literary and artistic movements of the Belle Epoque. Her writings and performances of La Métachorie, which demonstrated her theory of \\"a total fusion of the arts.\\" The later period of her life was dominated by the politics of the Middle East and North Africa. Early Life The only child of Alice de Glans de Cessiat and Charles-Joseph Vercell, Valentine is, by maternal descent, great-great- niece of the poet Alphonse de Lamartine. The pseudonym \\"de Saint-Point,\\" which she took when she entered the literary world, refers to the castle of her famous ancestor. In 1883, her father died. Alice de Glans de Cessiat then returned to Mâcon with her daughter, who grew up there surrounded by her grandmother and her tutor. In 1893, Valentine married Florian Théophile Perrenot, a professor 14 years her senior, whom she would follow as he was transferred. The following year, he was appointed to Lons-le-Saunier, where Valentine met Charles Dumont, professor of philosophy and colleague of her husband, who would become her lover. In 1897, Perrenot was appointed to Corsica, the first meeting between Valentine and the Mediterranean. A final transfer took Perrenot to Niort, where he died in the summer of 1899. Move to Paris The 24-year-old widow moved to Paris where she reestablished her relationship with Charles Dumont, future minister of the Third Republic. The couple married 20 June 1900 at City Hall in Paris's 1st arrondissement. In 1902, she organized a literary salon where she rubbed shoulders with Gabriele D'Annunzio, who is nicknamed \\"the muse purple\\", Rachilde, Natalie Clifford Barney, Paul Fort, Gabriel Tarde, who saw her as \\"an amiable madness of nature,\\" Alphonse Mucha and Auguste Rodin, for whom she posed, as well as other artists and politicians. Her friendship with the famous sculptor had importance in his artistic life, as evidenced by their correspondence. He called her the \\"goddess of the flesh of his inspiration in marble\\". She celebrated his work with poems (The Thinker and His Hands published in Poems of Pride in 1908) and an article, The dual Personality of Auguste Rodin, published in La Nouvelle Revue in November 1906. Rodin was often the guest of honor at her parties, contributing by his presence to make them prestigious. In 1903, during a seance, which were in vogue at the time, she met Ricciotto Canudo, an Italian poet and writer born in Bari in 1877. Canudo was also the review director for Europe Artiste and Monjoie; which was a critical element in regards to Cubist studies. Additionally, Ricciotto Canudo became the author of the Manifesto of Cerebrist Art. Shortly thereafter, she filed for divorce, which was delivered on 20 January 1904. Several reasons for the divorce were circulated, including the fact that she posed almost nude for Mucha and Rodin, and the courtship of Canudo. The applicant said that she wanted to pursue her artistic vocation, and that she wanted to live independently. As Valentine de Saint-Point was heavily inspired by the innovational works of Canudo and Marinetti, she began her Futurist practice before the wave of Futurism spread between 1909-1914. Valentine had developed her own practice within Futurism by taking inspiration from Canudo’s idea of it being \\"conceptual, eroticized, and sensual,\\" and Marinetti’s idea of it being \\"destructive, provocative, and energetic.\\" She took the name of Valentine Saint-Point and began a common-law relationship with Canudo, who actively supported her literary debut. Literary debut In January 1905 she published an article in The New journal entitled, Lamartine Unknown (Lamartine Inconnu), the title of which alluded to her poetic lineage. Following this she published her first collection of poetry, Poems of the Sea and the Sun which had been inspired by her trip to Spain with Canudo the previous year. In 1906, A Love, the first part of a trilogy, was well received by critics. She began her collaborations with several magazines such as The Artist Europe, The Mercury, The New Review, The Age, La Plume, and Gil Blas, whose founder was the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Incest which appeared at the beginning of the year 1907 collected mixed reactions from the public and critics. The theme of a mother initiating her son to physical love was the most controversial. The year 1909 was dedicated to theater. 28 May, Valentine Theatre Arts presents a one-act drama, The Fallen which was published by The New Review. Criticism was harsh, but the work was the first part of her dramatic trilogy The Theater of Women. In 1910 she published A woman and desire, an unacknowledged autobiographical confession that enabled her to express a few truths about female psychology and women's roles in society. In 1911, she moved into a studio at 19 rue de Tourville where her art would become denser and its most popular. She participated for the first time in the Salon des Indépendants, where she exhibited paintings and woodcuts until 1914. On 17 February 1912, she inaugurated her 'Apollonian' parties, which were reported in the press. Rachilde gave a reading of his play, The Seller of Sunshine and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti recited poems. Others who were present included, Philippe Berthelot, Saint-Pol-Roux, Boccioni, Gino Severini, Canudo, Florent Schmitt, Countess Venturini, and Mendes-Cattule. In addition to her artistic works, Valentine de Saint-Point wrote pieces which discuss the ironic themes of love and death. To further elaborate, some of her writings compare and contrast the themes of love beside, what was at the time, a theoretical debate on the death of the avant-garde movement. Both her and Tommaso Marinetti are well known futurist artists who gave their hand at writing, particularly texts which spoke against love. There has been debate in regards to whether the writings are literal or theoretical, therefore these writings have incited a non- historical approach to examining such works. The works of Saint-Point and Marinetti have caused a stir amongst literary and art historians, in an attempt to determine the relationship between death and life in the study of the avant-garde. Connection to Futurism In 1912 she published the Manifesto of Futurist Woman, which Saint-Point wrote in response to the misogynist ideas in Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism. It was read on 27 June at the Salle Gaveau, surrounded by the figureheads of the movement. The manifesto begins with the statement, \\"Humanity is mediocre. The majority of women are neither superior nor inferior to the majority of men. They are all equal. They all merit the same scorn.\\" Although she joined the Futurists in celebrating the virtues of virility, she also wrote: > It is absurd to divide humanity into men and women. It is composed only of > femininity and masculinity. Every superman, every hero, no matter how epic, > how much of a genius, or how powerful, is the prodigious expression of a > race and an epoch only because he is composed at once of feminine and > masculine elements, of femininity and masculinity: that is, a complete > being... > It is the same way with any collectivity and any moment in humanity, just as > it is with individuals. The fecund periods, when the most heroes and > geniuses come forth from the terrain of culture in all its ebullience, are > rich in masculinity and femininity. Those periods that had only wars, with > few representative heroes because the epic breath flattened them out, were > exclusively virile periods; those that denied the heroic instinct and, > turning toward the past, annihilated themselves in dreams of peace, were > periods in which femininity was dominant. We are living at the end of one of > these periods. What is most lacking in women as in men is virility. > That is why Futurism, even with all its exaggerations, is right. Saint-Point advocated the concept of the woman-warrior, as opposed to the traditional sentimental feminine ideals such as the \\"good mother,\\" and she conceptualized the \\"Überwoman\\" (sur-femme), as a counterpart to the Nietzschean Übermensch (surhomme). She also addressed the theme of lust, described by Saint-Point as \\"a force\\". Saint-Point would develop this theme into a second manifesto, the Futurist Manifesto of Lust, which was published a year later. These writings, translated throughout Europe, were a sensation and put women at the center of the debates of the Futurist movement, which was increasingly popular. But true to her intellectual independence, Saint-Point declared in January 1914 in Hansard: \\"I am not a futurist, and I've never been, I do not belong to any school.\\" Valentine de Saint-Point in her living room in 1914 Métachorie In May 1913 Theatre of the Women was published in Canudo's arts magazine Montjoie!, which published articles and drawings by many of the leading artists of the time. Saint-Point would continue to develop her ideas on theater and dance, which would eventually become La Métachorie, which she called \\"a total fusion of the arts.\\" Saint-Point's first exhibition of Métachorie took the form of a live performance on 20 December 1913 at the Theatre-Léon Poirier (Comédie des Champs-Elysées) in Paris. The show was a combination of light, sound, dance, and poetry. Saint-Point was almost nude, as she only wore silk veil pieces around portions of her body and face. Her idea behind this costuming was the ability to create abstract, geometric shapes, so that her movements were the primary concern of the audience, rather than the emotion of her face; this was something that was particularly important to her, as the Futurists were not interested in the idea of expressing sentimentality or emotion within their works. The music was taken from Florent Schmitt's La Guerre dans les airs, Debussy's Demoiselle élue, Satie's Les pantines dansent and Hymne au soleil, and Pratella's La guerra. The program consisted of four sections: Poèmes d'amour, Poèmes d'atmosphère, Poèmes panthéistes, Poèmes de guerre.Berghaus, Günter, and Valentine De Saint- Point. \\"Dance and the Futurist Woman: The Work of Valentine De Saint-Point (1875-1953).\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research, vol. 11, no. 2, 1993, pp. 27–42. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1290682. Initially, the stage was cast in penumbre. A dark figure was visible against a cabalistic emblem. Other signs in the form of shapes (a triangle, rectangle, circle, trapezium, parallelogram, octagon, and polyhedron) were projected onto the backdrop as the poem progressed. In October 1916, she published an article of the same name in Montjoie!. In it, she wrote: > I write my dance graphically as an orchestral score. And if wanting to > create a dance really essential, I expressed the general spirit of my poems > by a natural geometric stylization is that geometry is the science of lines, > that is to say, the essence of all visual arts, like arithmetic is the > science of numbers, that is to say the very essence of rhythmic arts: music > and poetry. ... in the Métachorie, is the idea which is the essence, the > soul. Dance and music are suggested by it, we can say that Métachorie form a > living organism, whose idea is the soul, the skeleton dance, music and > flesh. In 1917, Saint-Point presented Métachorie at New York's Metropolitan Opera House.  First World War  At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Ricciotto Canudo, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Blaise Cendrars appealed to other foreign artists living in Paris to join the French army. Canudo enlisted in the army and fought in Macedonia. Saint-Point joined the ranks of the Red Cross, and worked as secretary to Rodin. In 1916 she left France in the company of Vivian Postel du Mas and Daniel Chennevière (Dane Rudhyar). They went to Spain where they spend the summer months with the artist community based in Barcelona around Albert Gleizes, Francis Picabia and others.Burke, Carolyn (1999), \\"Recollecting Dada: Juliette Roche\\" in Sawelson-Gorse, Naomi, Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender and Identity, Cambridge: MIT Press, pp. 546–577, retrieved 8 March 2015 In November 1916 they set sail for the United States. Saint-Point was considering the possibility of establishing centers of dance inspired by her choreographic work, and gave a series of conferences across the country on Auguste Rodin, who had died shortly before.  Move to the Mediterranean  In 1918, she returned to France after a stay in Morocco, where she had converted to Islam. Back in Paris, the world she knew was gone, including her ties with old friends. Canudo had been wounded in the forehead and their relationship turned into friendship. Between 1919 and 1924, she made several trips to Corsica, where between her reading, including Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine, and meditating, Saint-Point attempted to create a College of Elites who would work towards the formation of a 'Mediterranean spirit,' or a merger the west and east. The project failed. Saint-Point's mother died in Macon in 1920, severing her last link with Burgundy. Then in 1923, Canudo died. In 1924 she published her last novel, The Secret. She was almost fifty years old at this time and nothing remained to connect her to France. At the end of 1924, accompanied by Vivian Postel du Mas and Jeanne Canudo, the widow of her former lover, Saint-Point moved to Cairo where her fame had preceded her. She joined a group of young writers and essayists, who organized debates, conferences and theatrical events. She wrote for various newspapers such as Liberty, and lectured. Along with Jeanne Canudo, she created a \\"center idéiste\\" which combines elements of her \\"College of Elites\\". End of 1925, she launched the publication of the Phoenix, a review the East's rebirth which cast a critical eye on Western policies in the Near and Middle East. She took up the causes of the Muslim world and Arab nationalism, challenging European imperialism and the cultural hegemony of the West. In 1927 she wrote the preface of a book on Saad Zaghloul, and in 1928, The Truth About Syria by a witness was published in France. Saint-Point's political writings generated fierce feuds within the Francophone community. She was accused of working against the interests of France and of being a spy in the pay of the Bolsheviks. Meanwhile, conferences organized by the \\"center idéiste\\" ended several times in violent disputes, which exasperated the Egyptian authorities and prompted them to expel Canudo Jeanne and Vivian Postel du Mas. While she was in Jerusalem in 1928, after spending two months in Lebanon to treat her health which had been shattered by the attacks to which she had been subjected, she was informed that she would be banned from returning to Egypt. She appealed to Philippe Berthelot, secretary general of the Quai d'Orsay. Eventually, the Ambassador in Cairo persuaded the authorities to allow her to remain in Egypt, but in return she would have to cease all political activities. In 1930 she became friends with Rene Guenon who just moved to Cairo. The end of her life was spent in the study of religion and meditation, while living in destitution, giving occasional consultations on dowsing and acupuncture. She died 28 March 1953 and is buried in the cemetery of El-Imam Leissi in Muslim tradition and as the Rawhiya Nour el-Deen (\\"zealot of divine light\\").

The main character and several enemies were designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Plot Professor Casper Clockwise is in his lab making the final adjustments to his time travelling device, when suddenly someone creeps behind him. Meanwhile, his son Callum \\"Rascal\\" Clockwise is walking through a secret route under the house to get to his father's lab when suddenly the lights go out and an alarm sounds. Rascal rushes down to see the problem, but to his horror two aliens in spacecraft appear and chase him down the corridor. Rascal finally makes it to his father's lab by going through the safe door entrance. He is shocked to find Chronon, the evil master of time, torturing his dad for unknown reasons, and holding him at gunpoint with another of his dad's inventions called the \\"Bubble Gun\\", but Chronon accidentally activates the controls for the time machine and he and the Professor are sucked into the time portal. The Bubble Gun manages to be released from the portal and lands at the feet of Rascal, who picks it up, vowing to save his dad. Rascal chases the two through time, from the medieval Castle Hackalott, to the Aztec Temple at Chichimeca, to the lost city of Atlantis, to the Jolly Raider pirate ship and Dodgy City in the old West, travelling to each location's past and present forms and collecting the pieces of a Time Clock from both before fighting Chronon in each area's future. Afterwards Rascal travels to the Corridors of Time, Chronon's lair within the space-time continuum where, after defeating its guardians brought from each of the other time periods, he successfully defeats Chronon and rescues his dad. After escaping using another time portal, Rascal and his dad safely return home, leaving the portal to shatter and trap Chronon in interdimensional time forever. Gameplay In the game, the player assumes the role of Rascal armed with the Bubble Gun, in a mission through five worlds - Castle Hackalott (a medieval castle), Chichimeca Temple (an ancient Aztec temple), the aquatic city of Atlantis, The Jolly Raider (a pirate ship), and Dodgy City (a town in the Wild West). Each world has three forms: past, present, and future (e.g. Castle Hackalott appears as a medieval castle in the past where in the present day, it has become a museum). The player needs only to complete the past level to gain access to the next world. In each past and present level, the player has to find the six pieces of the Time Clock in order to access the Time Bubble at the end and be able to access the next form of that world. Each future level has a boss fight against Chronon. Defeating him in all five gives access to the final world. The Bubble Gun has limited ammo, and which bubbles it shoots depends on how much ammo is left.  Development  Traveller's Tales founder Jon Burton revealed in a video posted in September 2018, that the poor controls were a result of the publisher requesting that the controls be changed from directional movement to tank controls similar to Tomb Raider, leading to issues with how the game's camera engine was designed. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Excepting the excellent visuals, there really isn't too much substance to Rascal. It's more of a technological achievement (one of the only PlayStation games with no noticeable load time) than a game, and worth picking up only for those who enjoy being annoyed.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1998 video games Category:3D platform games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Rascal (video game)"},{"id":"10984521","text":"The Putrajaya Monorail currently is an incomplete monorail system in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Putrajaya was originally planned to include a light rail system, but plans were changed, and a monorail plan was selected instead, after the construction of tunnels for aforementioned system began. It called for two sublines; Line 1, which is a monorail route with 17 stations and Line 2, which is a monorail route with 6 stations. In 2019, the government proposed a new light rapid transit (LRT) system may be built to revive the incomplete monorail project. but currently, the government decided to resume this project. Project Status Construction was halted in , and will probably resume as the city becomes more populated. The monorail will include the Monorail Suspension Bridge, currently incomplete, and the Putra Bridge. The monorail line would allow transfers to KLIA Transit, connecting to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur International Airport, at Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station. The project originally cost RM400 million. Putrajaya Monorail Project Revival MMC Corporation Berhad (MMC) has submitted a proposal to the Economic Council (EC) to revive the stalled monorail project since 2004 due to budget constraints. Hence, Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) will now be conducting a feasibility study for monorail and tram services for both Putrajaya and Cyberjaya. Putrajaya Tram Proposal Federal Territories Minister, Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor, had hoped to get tram infrastructure construction going within three years. Now under the jurisdiction of the Economic Council, the minister saw the development of the tram system as an alternative solution to the abandoned monorail projects and recommended it be built due to cost considerations. SPAD had hoped to open up tenders for the tram system between Putrajaya and Bangi in 2018 after getting the green light from EC. This move was announced by SPAD during their annual review of public transportation for 2017. The tram system was selected due to its relatively cheaper price of construction and operation compared to conventional rail systems. The tram system is expected to be integrated with the existing and future rail lines between Putrajaya and Bangi and will also cover the distance between Cyberjaya and Kajang. The new MRT Sungai Buloh - Kajang Line only reaches Kajang but MRT Sungai Buloh - Serdang - Putrajaya Line will reach Putrajaya Sentral when it is completed in the future. The future HSR station located at Kampung Abu Bakar Baginda will be one of the expected stops along the planned tram route. The stretch between Putrajaya and Bangi has been selected as the first phase to be constructed due to their wide roads, allowing the tram system to share the traffic.

She was a pioneering educator who taught other enslaved people how to read and influenced the founding of Jackson State University.  Early life  Lily Ann Granderson's grandmother was a free woman of Native American descent. After she died, Granderson's mother was sold into slavery at three years of age. Little is known about Granderson's father, except that he was a white man from one of the First Families of Virginia (FFV). Later, after she had given birth to Granderson, her mother moved to Kentucky where Granderson began work as a house slave. Granderson and the master's family became close, and the master's children even taught her how to read and write, a common method used by enslaved people to gain literacy. When her master died, Granderson was shipped down to Mississippi where she was sold to another slave master. On this plantation, Granderson worked in the fields, causing her to fall ill. She requested to be removed from the field and placed somewhere where the work would not put a strain on her health. The slave master granted her permission to work in the kitchen at his home. In this position, Granderson was required to make a trip into town from the plantation every day, as the slave master's home was not located directly on the plantation but in town. It was during this time that Granderson opened up her school for enslaved peoples.  Contributions and legacy  Granderson used her trips into town to start her school for slaves. It was against the law in Mississippi to educate slaves out of fear of rebels and runaways. To get around this law, Granderson held classes late at night, when enslaved children could sneak out to attend class. Class size was limited to twelve children at a time. After the children had learned how to read and write, they \\"graduated,\\" making room for twelve more children. Granderson operated this class for about seven years without being discovered. Word eventually got out about this late-night class for slaves, but there was not a penalty for Granderson's actions. Although there was a law against the education of slaves, there was a loophole in this Mississippi law that applied to Granderson's case. While it was against Mississippi law for white people and free slaves to educate another slave, the law did not forbid one slave educating another slave. As a result of this, Granderson recovered from this setback and opened a Sabbath school in addition to her late-night school. Through her efforts, hundreds of students became literate and were able to use their literacy to acquire freedom. She is also accredited with heavily influencing the creation of what is today Jackson State University (formerly known as Natchez Seminary). At 54 years of age, she became one of the first African-Americans to open an account at the Freedman's Bank.  Personal life  Granderson was married to Oliver Granderson and had two children. After her death in 1889, she was buried in Natchez City Cemetery.  References  *Laura S. Haviland, A Woman's Life-Work: Labors and Experiences of Laura S.

The apartheid-era drama, inspired by a true story, is set in an unnamed prison clearly based on South Africa's notorious Robben Island prison, where Nelson Mandela was held for twenty-seven years. It focuses on two cellmates, one whose successful appeal means that his release draws near and one who must remain in prison for many years to come. They spend their days performing futile physical labor and nights rehearsing in their cell for a performance of Sophocles' Antigone in front of the other prisoners. One takes the part of Antigone, who defies the laws of the state to bury her brother, and the other takes the part of her uncle Creon, who sentences her to die for her crime of conscience. The play draws parallels between Antigone's situation and the situation of black political prisoners. Tensions arise as the performance approaches, especially when one of the prisoners learns that he has won an early release and the men's friendship is tested. Structure The play has four scenes. It opens with a lengthy mimed sequence in which John and Winston, two cell mates imprisoned on Robben Island, shovel sand in the scorching heat, dumping the sand at the feet of the other man, so that the pile of the sand never diminishes. This is designed to exhaust the body and the morale of the prisoners. Later scenes include a play within a play, as Winston and John perform a condensed two-person version of Antigone by Sophocles. History The play was first performed in Cape Town, at a theatre called The Space, in July 1973. In order to evade the draconian censorship in South Africa at the time (plays dealing with prison conditions, etc., were prohibited), the play premiered under the title, Die Hodoshe Span. It was next staged at the Royal Court Theatre in London, with John Kani and Winston Ntshona portraying John and Winston respectively. The Broadway production, presented in repertory with Sizwe Banzi Is Dead, opened on November 24, 1974 at the Edison Theatre, where it ran for 52 performances. In an unusual move, Kani and Ntshona were named co-Tony Award nominees (and eventual co-winners) for Best Actor in a Play for both The Island and Sizwe Banzi Is Dead. Over the next thirty years, Kani and Ntshona periodically performed in productions of the play. Notable among them were the Royal National Theatre in 2000 , reported at the time as their final production, although they went on to star at the Old Vic in 2002 and the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2004 . Plot John and Winston share a prison cell on an unnamed Island. After another day of hard labor and having been forced to run while shackled and then beaten, they return to their cell. They tend each other's wounds, share memories of times at the beach and rehearse for the prisoner-performed concert which is imminent. They are going to perform a scene from an abridged version of Antigone by Sophocles. John will play Creon and Winston will play Antigone. When he sees himself in his costume, Winston tries to pull out of playing a female role, fearing he will be humiliated. John is called to the governor's office. He returns with news that his appeal was successful and his ten-year sentence has been commuted to three years: he will be free in three months. Winston is happy for him. As they imagine what leaving prison and returning home will be like, Winston begins to unravel. He doubts why he ever made a stand against the regime, why he even exists. Having said it, he experiences a catharsis, and accepts that he must endure. The final scene is their performance of Antigone. After John- as-Creon sentences Winston-as-Antigone to be walled up in a cave for having defied him and done her duty towards her dead brother, Winston pulls off Antigone's wig and yells \\"Gods of Our Fathers! My Land! My Home! Time waits no longer. I go now to my living death, because I honored those things to which honor belongs\\". The final image is of John and Winston, chained together once more, running hard as the siren wails. Characters * John has been imprisoned for belonging to a banned organization. * Winston, we find out later was imprisoned for burning his passbook in front of the police. This was a serious crime, as the passbook was used to segregate and control the South African people. * Hodoshe, an unseen character: he is referred to and represented by the sound of a prison whistle.

He worked on commissions for the local churches as well as from the Grand-Dukes of Tuscany. In his work he shows a preference for nocturnal effects which reveals the influence of Caravaggio and his followers, the so-called Caravaggisti. Life Francesco Rustici was born in Siena in 1592 as the scion of an artistic family. His father Vincenzo Rustici as well as his uncle Cristoforo Rustici and his mother's brother Alessandro Casolani were all prominent painters active in Siena.Ladislav Daniel, The Florentines: art from the time of the Medici grand dukes, Exhibition catalogue: Prague, Waldstein Riding School Gallery, 16.5.-18.8.2002, Olomouc, Museum of Arts, 26.9.-5.1.2003, Cheb, Gallery of Fine Arts, 14.2.-6.4.2003, published by National Gallery in Prague, 2002, p. 92Filippo Baldinucci, Opere di Filippo Baldinucci volume primo [-decimoquarto]: Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua opera di Filippo Baldinucci fiorentino accademico della Crusca con note ed aggiunte, Volume 12, Timbro non identificato dalla Società tipografica de' classici italiani contrada del Cappuccio, 1812, p. 101-102. Filippo Baldinucci stated that Cristoforo Rustici was Francesco's father but that is no longer accepted. Concert, M. Žilinskas Art Gallery, Kaunas, Lithuania He trained with his father who was the chief collaborator in the workshop of his brother-in-law Alessandro Casolani. Casolini himself was influenced by the work of Domenico Beccafumi. While working in his father's workshop, Francesco Rustici's hand was initially difficult to distinguish from that of his father. His precocious talent was spotted by Giulio Mancini, a local physician, art collector and art dealer who mentioned the young artist in hi Considerazioni sulla pittura ('Thoughts on painting'), written between 1617 and 1621. It is believed that the artist spent time in Rome in the period 1624-1625. In Rome he deepened his study of other Caravaggisti such as the Dutchman Gerrit van Honthorst. The death of Lucretia Towards the end of his life he received commissions from Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria who commissioned The death of Saint Mary Magdalene and The death of Lucretia. He was also in contact with Lorenzo Magalotti, an important personage in the organization of the cultural projects of the Barberini.Gianni Papi, Gherardo delle Notti: Quadri bizarrissimi e cene allegre, Giunti Editore, p. 228-233 Work The known oeuvre of Francesco Rustici is not numerous. His early works show the influence of his father and of Alessandro Casolani who painted in the Sienese Mannerist style.Enzo Carli, Carlo Bertelli, 'Catalogo della pittura italiana dal '300 al '700', G. Mondadori, 1985, p. 298 Later he came under the influence of the style of Caravaggio.Mary Magdalene (1620-1626), Francesco Rustici, known as Rustichino, Fondazione Cariplo, at Google Cultural Institute This is visible in the realistic and warm humanity with which he rendered his subjects.Francesco Rustici, La sapienza e la prudenza at the Museo San Donato Another important influence on his work was Gerrit van Honthorst, who was known for his mastery of nocturnal effects, which had earned him in Italy the nickname 'Gherardo delle Notti' (\\"Gerard of the nights\\"). Rustici's handling of light followed the Dutch-Flemish model of van Honthorst and blended it with a wholly Tuscan form of Classicism. Rustichino painted a number of paintings which used the devise of the dark scene lit up by a single light source that was so favoured by tenebrists to create dramatic chiaroscuro effects. Wisdom and Prudence Rustichino's style appears generally to have been closer to the style of Orazio Gentileschi, particularly in his use of bright and lively colours.Marco Pierini, 'Art in Siena', Scala, 2001, p. 158 However, he did not entirely embrace the naturalism of Gentileschi.

They offered a touring car boasting seven seats that sold for $3,250 in 1907. It was advertised as the \\"Mile-a-Minute\\" car. They also offered smaller vehicles, with chain and shaft-driven 20 hp flat-twins, and a shaft driven four of 28/30-horsepower. History The Dolson family were successful wagon builders in the late 19th century. The company was located in Charlotte, about 10 miles southwest of Lansing, Michigan. In 1902 the company built their first automobile, a 5-passenger touring car, equipped with a two-cylinder water cooled engine, which had 15 horsepower and cost US$1,450. Dolson began producing automobiles in 1904, beginning with four-cylinder touring models. The automobile was regarded for its use of galvanized steel copper sheet panel bodywork. Production increased in 1905 when the carriage business began to phase out. By 1906, Dolson was producing four different models of automobile. In 1907, Dolson produced the Model F Roadster, called the \\"Cannon Ball\\". The Cannon Ball had a four-cylinder engine that produced 60 horsepower, advertisements claimed the vehicle could go 75 miles per hour (120 km/hr). The company ran out of capital soon after it acquired the St. Anne Kerosine Motor Company, and liquidated in 1908. In 2012, a Charlotte resident and a few investors purchased a 1907 Dolson from an auction in Plymouth, with a goal of returning a Dolson to the city of Charlotte. Some residents of the town gathered and cheered as the man and his father filled the automobile with gasoline, cranked it and took it for a short spin, with local media coverage.

She was a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Taschereau in the Quebec City region. She represented the Parti Québécois. Maltais mostly worked in the theatrical sector being a development agent for Video-Femmes and the director of the Periscope and the la Bordée theaters. She was also a member of the Conseil québécois de théâtre. She was a political activist since 1976 when she obtained a diploma at the Cégep de Sainte-Foy. She was a spokesperson for the YES committee in the 1995 referendum and was involved in the organization of the Fête Nationale concerts and shows in 1991 and 1995. Maltais was first elected in Taschereau in 1998 and became the Minister of Culture and Communications from 1998 to 2001. She was then named the Delegate Minister of Health, Social Services and Youth protection and Delegate Minister of Employment. Re-elected in 2003, she was the President of the Opposition Caucus. After 9 years in Opposition, the PQ formed a slim minority government after the 2012 election. Maltais immediately entered Cabinet as Minister of Labour, Employment, and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the status of women. In this portfolio, she presided over controversial changes to the social assistance system in Quebec, that put the PQ government in conflict with some anti-poverty groups. Maltais was also critical of changes to the EI system announced by the federal Conservative government in Ottawa. Long identified with the left-wing of the Parti Quebecois, Maltais has been elected 6 times in the inner-city riding of Taschereau in Quebec City. While the riding had been a safe seat for the PQ, it has become much more marginal in recent years as the PQ has become increasingly less and less competitive in the Capital Region. In 2014, Maltais only held onto the riding by 400 votes over her Liberal challenger and hers was the only PQ held seat in the region. She did not run for re-election in 2018. In 2003, Ms. Maltais became the first openly lesbian member of the National Assembly, when she came out to an audience at Laval University.

The Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) is a non- profit, nonpartisan 501(c)(6) professional organization for public and private sector members of the United States Intelligence Community, based in Arlington, Virginia.  History  INSA was established as the Security Affairs Support Association (SASA) in 1979 to bring together professionals in the intelligence field, primarily focused on the National Security Agency and to help members keep abreast of intelligence and national security community issues. SASA's main office was in Annapolis Junction, Maryland. In November 2005, SASA's Board of Directors voted to change its name to the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) so as to expand its reach across the intelligence and national security communities and better serve the community in the aftermath of the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).  Mission  INSA is the premier intelligence and national security organization that provides a unique venue for collaboration, networking and examination of policy issues and solutions. Representing an unprecedented alliance among senior leaders from the public, private, and academic sectors, INSA members form an unparalleled community of experts that collaborate to develop creative, innovative and timely solutions to the intelligence and national security issues facing the United States. INSA works to promote and recognize the highest standards within the national security and intelligence communities. INSA members include current and former high- ranking intelligence, military and government agency leaders, analysts, and experts from industry and academia. Drawing on the experience and expertise of this membership, the Intelligence and National Security Alliance provides the thought leadership that identifies crucial intelligence topics, completes strategic research and promotes innovative solutions. INSA has approximately 150 corporate members, as well as over one-thousand individual members, who are industry leaders within the government, private sector, and academia. The current President is Ambassador Joseph DeTrani, who has served as the Senior Advisor to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the Director of the National Counter Proliferation Center (NCPC) and the National Intelligence Manager for Counterproliferation (CP).

The act bars the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment: it prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future, and it bars employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.Statement of Administration policy, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, April 27, 2007 Senator Ted Kennedy called it the \\"first major new civil rights bill of the new century.\\" The Act contains amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974See Act sec. 101. and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.See Act sec. 103.

Bush signed the bill into law on May 21, 2008.  Legislative history   Preliminary bills  In the 104th Congress (1995–1996) several related bills were introduced. * The Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996, : Sen. Mark Hatfield and : Rep. Clifford Stearns * The Genetic Fairness Act of 1996, : Sen. Dianne Feinstein * The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1995, : Rep. Louise Slaughter and : Sen. Olympia Snowe * Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1996, : Sen. Pete Domenici In 1997, the Coalition for Genetic Fairness (CGF) was formed by several patient and civil rights groups to spearhead genetic nondiscrimination legislation on Capitol Hill. The CGF became the primary non-governmental driver of Federal genetic non-discrimination legislation. In 2003, GINA was introduced as , by Louise Slaughter, D-NY, and as by Senator Snowe, R-ME. In 2005, it was proposed as by Representative Biggert, R-IL, and as by Senator Snowe, R-ME. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives as by Representatives Slaughter, Biggert, Eshoo, and Walden. It passed the House by a 420 - 9 - 3 vote on April 25, 2007.  Final legislation  The same bill was introduced into the United States Senate as by Senators Olympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, Mike Enzi, and Christopher Dodd.Gene act, Wired magazineGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007, National Human Genome Research Institute, Update as of May 2, 2007, (accessed July 28, 2007)US to outlaw corporate prejudice based on genes, 10:00 06 May 2007, New Scientist Print Edition. On April 24, 2008, the Senate approved the bill 95-0, with five Senators not voting (including presidential candidates McCain, Clinton, and Obama). It had been subject of a \\"Secret hold\\" placed by Tom Coburn, Republican U.S. senator from Oklahoma.buffalonews.com The bill was then sent back to the House of Representatives and passed 414–16–1 on May 1, 2008 (the lone dissenter was Congressman Ron Paul). President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on May 21, 2008. The text of the final approved version of GINA is here.  Regulation  On May 17, 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) amended various GINA regulations providing further clarification on acceptable workplace wellness programs. The new guidelines are effective on July 16, 2016. The new amendments require that (1) employee wellness programs are voluntary; (2) employers cannot deny health care coverage for non participation, or (3) take adverse employment actions against or coerce employees who do not participate in wellness programs. Additionally, the new GINA regulations cover spousal participation in wellness programs and employers may not ask employees or covered dependents to agree to permit the sale of their genetic information in exchange for participation in wellness plans.  Debate during consideration   Arguments for  Along with an overview of the topic, the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute states that \\"NHGRI believes that legislation that gives comprehensive protection against all forms of genetic discrimination is necessary to ensure that biomedical research continues to advance. Similarly, it believes that such legislation is necessary so that patients are comfortable availing themselves to genetic diagnostic tests.\\" This point of view thus regards GINA as important for the advancement of personalized medicine.GINA — A big step toward personalized medicine, by David Resnick, Mass Tech High, August 22, 2008. The Coalition for Genetic FairnessCoalition for Genetic Fairness presents some arguments for genetic nondiscrimination. As of 2007, their argument makes the claim that because all humans have genetic anomalies, this would prevent them from accessing medication and health insurance. The coalition also cites the potential for misuse of genetic information. The GINA legislation has historically received support from the majority of both Democrats and Republicans, as evidenced by the 420-3 vote in 2007 by the House of Representatives.  Arguments against  The National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, the Society for Human Resource Management, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and other members of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Employment Coalition (GINE) say the proposed legislation is overly broad and are concerned the bills would do little to rectify inconsistent state laws and hence might increase frivolous litigation and/or punitive damages as a result of ambiguous record-keeping and other technical requirements. In addition, they are concerned that it would force employers to offer health plan coverage of all treatments for genetically-related conditions.businessinsurance.com geneforum.org Insurance industry representatives argued that they may need genetic information. Without it, more high-risk people would buy insurance, causing rate unfairness. Limitations and calls for extension While GINA has been cited as a strong step forward, some say that the legislation does not go far enough in enabling personal control over genetic testing results.Genetic Protections Skimp on Privacy, Says Gene Tester, Wired Science, May 23, 2008 The law does not cover life, disability, or long-term care insurance, which may cause some reluctance to get tested. Some legal scholars have called for the addition of a \\"disparate impact\\" theory of action to strengthen GINA as a law. 2017 proposal to reduce protection In 2017, HR 1313 was introduced which would have let employers demand workers' genetic test results. The bill was not enacted.

The Earl was a continuation of the Briscoe. The Model 40 offered both open and closed models with a four-cylinder engine. Approximately 2,000 vehicles were produced. When the Earl debuted in 1921, the tourer cost just $1285. The company also claimed that $100 worth of \\"extras\\", such as linoleum floor boards and carpets front and rear were included in the base price. Benjamin Briscoe appointed Clarence A. Earl as president of Briscoe Motor Corporation in March 1921. Earl had previously been vice- president of Willys-Overland. Briscoe suddenly left in October of the same year, tired of all the misfortune he had suffered in the automotive field to date. He left his car and company to Earl. Earl then announced to the press that he would be forming Earl Motors and bringing out a new four-cylinder car. This was really just the Briscoe car with small modifications to solve some of its problems, as well as being slightly larger and more powerful. Earl assumed many problems with the company, not least of which was one and a half million dollars of debt. Luckily, Clarence Earl easily raised more capital from bankers. On the Earl Motors board were several bankers, as well as executives from various supplier firms. Included in the latter group was George C. Scobie, who had been with Price-Waterhouse and Hayes Wheel Company, and was now vice-president of the new organization. Clarence Earl developed disagreements with all these board members over the future path of his company, and resigned in November 1922. He then became president of National. Earl had wanted to become a high-volume producer, while the rest of the board preferred a lower-volume, more fiscally conservative approach. The bankers and supplier executives now took over the company, with George Scobie as president. They promptly reorganized as the Earl Motor Manufacturing Company in early 1923. The new company was capitalized at one million dollars. Soon, this group failed in pursuing their favored lower-volume approach, taking the company down with them. Early in 1924, servicing rights to the now defunct Earl were sold to Standard Motor Parts Company of Detroit. Total Earl production was approximately 1,900 cars. Rarity There are only a handful of Earl Custom Roadsters left in the world. There have been persistent incorrect reports that an Earl Roadster is on display at the Ella Sharp Museum in Jackson, MI. The museum curator has reported that people have driven as far as South Carolina to see the vehicle. However the museum does not have such a vehicle (as of 4 August 2011). Private owners of Earl Roadsters are thought to exist in Jackson.

From 1968 to 1987 SRC was the home of Tantalus, the first storage ring dedicated to the production of synchrotron radiation. History The Road to SRC: 1953–1968 15 universities formed the Midwest Universities Research Association (MURA) in 1953 to promote and design a high energy proton synchrotron, to be built in the Midwest. With the intent of constructing a large accelerator, MURA purchased a suitable area of land with an underlying flat limestone base near Stoughton, Wisconsin, about 10 miles from the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin. MURA's first accelerator was a 45 MeV synchrotron, built in a concrete underground \\"vault\\", mostly for radiation protection purposes. A small electron storage ring, operating at 240 Mev, was designed by Ed Rowe and collaborators as a test facility to study high currents, and construction of this ring started in 1965. However, in 1963 President Johnson had decided that the next large accelerator facility would not be built at the MURA site, but in Batavia, Illinois; this became Fermilab. In 1967 MURA dissolved with the storage ring incomplete and with no further funding. The researchers, feeling teased by fate (and the government backers) named the machine after the mythological figure Tantalus, famed for his eternal punishment to stand beneath a fruit tree with the fruit ever eluding his grasp. In 1966 a subcommittee of the National Research Council, which had been investigating the properties of synchrotron radiation from the 240 MeV ring, recommended it be completed as a tool for spectroscopy. A successful proposal was made to the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the ring was completed in 1968—the first storage ring dedicated to the production of synchrotron radiation. With the demise of MURA, a new entity was created to run the facility: the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC), administered by the University of Wisconsin. Tantalus: 1968–1987 Ed Rowe (Center) at the opening of a Canadian PRT beamline on Tantalus in 1983 Tantalus had a circumference of just over 9m, and, with an energy of 240 MeV, had a critical energy of slightly under 50 eV. It achieved its first stored beam in March 1968. Initial operations were very difficult, with only about 5 hours per week of usable beam, and currents of less than 1mA. Initial users came from three groups, who took turns using their commercial monochromators on the one available beamline. On August 7, 1968 this first dedicated storage ring based synchrotron radiation facility produced its first data when Ulrich Gerhardt of the University of Chicago, carried out simultaneous reflection and absorption measurements on CdS over the wavelength range 1100-2700 Å. In 1972 the building was enlarged to accommodate new beamlines, and by 1973 there were ten ports, and beam currents were up to about 50 mA. A new injector, a 40 MeV microtron, was installed as an injector in 1974, replacing the original MURA accelerator that had been used until that point, and within a year currents exceeded 150 mA, with typically over 30 hours of beam per week. A stored beam of 260 mA was achieved in 1977. In October 1974 the National Science Foundation took over funding from the Air Force. Initial monochromators were commercial instruments with drawbacks for use at a synchrotron. SRC started a program of instrument development, both to take advantage of the unique properties of synchrotron radiation and to make beamlines available to users without their own instruments. Such users became known as \\"general users\\", while groups with their own beamlines became known as Participating Research Teams (PRTs). This model has become widely used at other facilities, where PRTs are also denoted Collaborating Access Teams (CATs) and Collaborating Research Groups (CRGs). PRTs have been used extensively by US scientists at US facilities but by 2010 were somewhat out of favor. The CRG in Europe, however, remains as an important and successful means of flexible access. For two decades Tantalus produced hundreds of experiments and was a testing ground for many synchrotron techniques still in use. Current synchrotron facilities can be very large, while Tantalus was not, and its small building, even after the 1972 expansion, was crowded with equipment and researchers. Users worked in very close quarters and the close proximity combined with the relative isolation of the facility, made cross fertilization of ideas unavoidable. The atmosphere was open, friendly, and informal, although not particularly comfortable physically, The heating system in one washroom did not work, so, to avoid frozen pipes, users just left the door wide open. After someone posted a sign alerting users to the policy, an international contest began, with each person translating the message into their own language. A copy of this sign was included as part of an NSF funding request as evidence of Tantalus's growing international impact. Research during those early years was dominated by optical spectroscopy. In 1971 an IBM research group produced the first photoelectron spectra using Tantalus, a milestone in the development of photoemission spectroscopy as a research tool. The tunability of the radiation allowed researchers to disentangle a material's ground-state electronic properties. In the mid-1970s the increasing beam current from the ring gave intensity levels sufficient for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, with a joint Bell Labs–Montana State University group conducting the earliest experiments. As an experimental technique, angle-resolved photoemission developed rapidly and had an important conceptual impact on condensed-matter physics. Gas-phase spectroscopy was another successful field at SRC, starting from early absorption studies of noble gases. With the new Aladdin storage ring operating, Tantalus was officially decommissioned in 1987, although it was run for six weeks in the summer of 1988 for experiments in atomic and molecular fluorescence. The storage ring was disassembled in 1995, and half the ring, the RF cavity and one of the original beamlines are now in storage at the Smithsonian Institution. Aladdin, the early years: 1976–1986 One of the first beamlines on the Aladdin synchrotron, late 1980s Entrance to the Synchrotron Radiation Center, 2011. In 1976 SRC submitted a proposal to the NSF for a 750 MeV storage ring as an intense source of VUV and soft x-ray radiation to an energy greater than one keV. This proposed ring was named Aladdin. Funding for the new ring was obtained from the NSF, the State of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). The final design was a four straight section 1 GeV ring, of 89 m circumference, and construction of some components started in 1978. A new 32,000 sq ft building to house the facility started construction in April 1979. The initial target date for first stored beam was October 1980. The construction phase of Aladdin ended in 1981, but by late 1984 SRC had been unable to complete the commissioning of the facility, with a maximum stored current of 2.5 mA, too little to provide useful light intensities. Accelerator experts reviewing the project recommended the addition of a booster synchrotron at a cost of $25 million. In May 1985, after a review by L. Edward Temple of the Department of Energy, which recommended still another study period while difficulties were ironed out, NSF director Eric Bloch decided not only against the upgrade, but also against continued funding for Aladdin operations. SRC was kept running with existing NSF funding for Tantalus and funds from WARF. The University of Wisconsin made it clear it would only continue funding Aladdin until June 1986, a situation characterized on campus as the Perils of Pauline. Concurrent with these events, the technical issue limiting the machine performance had been solved, and three months after the decision to withdraw NSF funding, currents of 40 mA had been achieved. By July 1986 this had risen to over 150mA, and NSF funding was restored. Closing National Science Foundation funding stopped in 2011. The University of Wisconsin gave SRC $2 million to keep the facility operating until June 2013, while new funding was sought. The biggest budget cutbacks were in education, outreach and support for outside users. By January 2012 the facility had lost about one-third of its staff to retirements and layoffs. In February 2014 the facility director announced that the center would be closing. The final beam run was completed March 7, 2014, after which the process of dismantling and disposing of the equipment began. SRC history project A project, completed in 2011, collected oral histories and historical documents related to SRC. These were deposited in the archives of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and digitized copies of some of the material are available online. G. J. Lapeyre award In 1973 the vault that held Tantalus was being enlarged, and during a facility picnic a rainstorm hit and caused the vault to start to flood. Jerry Lapeyre of Montana State University used the lab's tractor to build earthworks to divert the water. His efforts led then-director Rowe to create the annual G. J. Lapeyre award to be awarded to \\"one who met and overcame the greatest obstacle in the pursuit of their research\\".

The avifauna of Wallis and Futuna include a total of 39 species, of which two have been introduced by humans and three are rare or accidental. Two species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Wallis and Futuna. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Wallis and Futuna *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Wallis and Futuna as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Pheasants, grouse, and allies  Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of quails, partridges, snowcocks, francolins, spurfowls, tragopans, monals, pheasants, peafowls, grouse, ptarmigan, and junglefowls. In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings. *Red junglefowl, Gallus gallus (I) Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Herald petrel, Pterodroma heraldica (A) *Mottled petrel, Pterodroma inexpectata (A) *Black-winged petrel, Pterodroma nigripennis *Gould's petrel, Pterodroma leucoptera (A) *Collared petrel, Pterodroma brevipes *Tahiti petrel, Pseudobulweria rostrata (A) *Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacifica *Buller's shearwater, Ardenna bulleri *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna grisea *Newell's shearwater, Puffinus newelli (A) *Tropical shearwater, Puffinus bailloni Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *Red-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon rubricauda *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Red-footed booby, Sula sula *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Great frigatebird, Fregata minor (A) *Lesser frigatebird, Fregata ariel Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *White-faced heron, Egretta novaehollandiae (A) *Pacific reef- heron, Egretta sacra Ducks, geese and swans Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight. *Swamp harrier, Circus approximans (A) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis *Black-backed swamphen, Porphyrio indicus *Australasian swamphen, Porphyrio melanotus *Spotless crake, Zapornia tabuensis Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels and lapwings.

The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Bristle-thighed curlew, Numenius tahitiensis *Wandering tattler, Tringa incana *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. *Greater crested tern, Thalasseus bergii (A) *Black-naped tern, Sterna sumatrana *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Black noddy, Anous minutus *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus *White tern, Gygis alba Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia (I) *Friendly ground dove, Gallicolumba stairi *Crimson-crowned fruit dove, Ptilinopus porphyraceus *Pacific imperial pigeon, Ducula pacifica Old World parrots Order: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittaculidae *Blue-crowned lorikeet, Vini australis Cuckoos and anis Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae The family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners and anis.

They have long strong legs with powerful talons. *Barn owl, Tyto alba Swifts Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *White-rumped swiftlet, Aerodramus spodiopygius *Australian swiftlet, Aerodramus terraereginae Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs and stubby tails. *Pacific kingfisher, Todirhamphus sacer *Sacred kingfisher, Todirhamphus sanctus Cuckooshrikes Order: PasseriformesFamily: Campephagidae The cuckooshrikes are small to medium-sized passerine birds. They are predominantly greyish with white and black, although some species are brightly coloured. *Polynesian triller, Lalage maculosa Monarch flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Monarchidae The monarch flycatchers are small to medium-sized insectivorous passerines which hunt by flycatching. *Fiji shrikebill, Clytorhynchus vitiensis Honeyeaters Order: PasseriformesFamily: Meliphagidae The honeyeaters are a large and diverse family of small to medium-sized birds most common in Australia and New Guinea. They are nectar feeders and closely resemble other nectar-feeding passerines. *Wattled honeyeater, Foulehaio carunculata Starlings Order: PasseriformesFamily: Sturnidae Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds. Their flight is strong and direct and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. They eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen. *Polynesian starling, Aplonis tabuensis *Common myna, Acridotheres tristis (I) See also *List of birds *Lists of birds by region References * * Category:Environment of Wallis and Futuna Wallis and Futuna Birds Wallis and Futuna birds ' ","title":"List of birds of Wallis and Futuna"},{"id":"10984889","text":"Strategic service management (SSM) is a business strategy that aims to optimize the post-sales service that a company provides, by synchronizing service parts and resources forecasting, service partners, workforce technicians, and service pricing.

He was the member of National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Robert- Baldwin for the Quebec Liberal Party. Marsan went to the Université du Québec à Montréal and obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration and would add a master's degree in health administration at Université de Montréal. He was a guest teacher in the faculty of administration at the Université de Montréal and was a director in hospital services at the Hotel- Dieu's Saint-Jérôme Hospital. He was the general manager at the Montreal Heart Institute and the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur. He was an assistant director at Santa Cabrini Hospital. He was also a board member for several institutions including the Montreal Heart Institute, the Epic Foundation, the Hôpital du Sacré Coeur Foundation and the president of the Association of Canadian Teaching Hospitals. Marsan was first elected in Robert-Baldwin in 1994 and was in charged for the electoral campaign program Pour un Quebec en Santé in 1998. He was re-elected for a third term in 2003 and was the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health and Social Services and then the Secretary to Jean Charest. He was re-elected for a fourth term in 2007 and named the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities. Political career Fundraising controversy On September 16, 2013, a journalist revealed a letter circulating in the Association sépharade de la banlieue ouest de Montréal signed by Pierre Marsan and his chief electoral officer, Aimé Bensoussan. The letter solicited contributions from members of the association, reminding them that the local Jewish community benefited from generous contributions, including a daycare permit, while the Liberals were in power. PRIMEUR 24h - Des libéraux courtisent la communauté juive The Parti québécois and the Coalition Avenir Québec strongly reacted to the event, claiming that this added to a long list of recent instances of corruption within the Quebec Liberal Party, which has favoured Liberal contributors in daycare permit attributions and other types of financial compensations. Pierre Marsan formally apologised for his \\"clumsy\\" gesture. Party leader Philippe Couillard qualified the incident as \\"unacceptable\\", declaring that such practices will never again take place in the party. Le PQ réclame une enquête du DGEQ On September 17, 2013, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec, Jacques Drouin, declared that there would be an inquiry in the constituency of Robert-Baldwin following these events, upon which Pierre Marsan and Aimé Bensoussan will be called., Lettre de Pierre Marsan: le DGE étudiera le dossier Don Macpherson: Couillard can’t escape his party’s past Pierre Marsan présente ses excuses concernant la lettre aux synagogues juives et le DGE s'en mêle Sources Electoral record (partial) External links * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Montreal Category:Quebec Liberal Party MNAs Category:Université de Montréal alumni Category:Université du Québec à Montréal alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Pierre Marsan"},{"id":"10984999","text":"Altenburg is a municipality in the district of Horn in Lower Austria, Austria.

The property on which Rowneybury stands was part of Pishiobury before being divided in the 1880s. It was owned by Hertfordshire County Council and used as a home for children with learning disabilities. The original property had two upper floors, and a cellar under the majority of the main building. After laying empty for several years, it was purchased from the Council and renovated, then bought in 1999 for £2.5 million by the footballer David Beckham and his wife, the singer Victoria Beckham. The property became dubbed \\"Beckingham Palace\\" by the press as a portmanteau of their surname and Buckingham Palace. They spent around £3 million on refurbishment, including a maze designed by James Gardner, in the grounds. In 2001, Victoria Beckham made a virtual tour of the mansion available online. The property was put up for sale by the Beckhams in 2013. go The house with 17 acres of grounds was bought by the insurance tycoon Neil Utley, chairman of Hastings Direct, and Narmali Utley for £11.35 million in 2014. Rowneybury Cottage, near the entrance to the estate on Harlow Road, is a Grade II listed building. This timberframed house, dating from the late 16th- century to early 17th-century, was listed in 1981.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in New Caledonia. The avifauna of New Caledonia include a total of 189 species, of which 23 are endemic, 14 have been introduced by humans and 48 are rare or accidental. Three species listed are extirpated in New Caledonia and are not included in the species count, as are at least 14 extinct species. Twelve species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for New Caledonia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in New Caledonia *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to New Caledonia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to New Caledonia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in New Caledonia although populations exist elsewhere *(Ext) Extinct - a species formerly endemic or native to New Caledonia, that is now extinct Grebes Australasian grebe Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Australasian grebe, Tachybaptus novaehollandiae Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. *Wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans *Southern royal albatross, Diomedea epomophora (A) *Black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophris (A) Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Antarctic giant petrel, Macronectes giganteus (A) *Northern giant petrel, Macronectes halli (A) *Cape petrel, Daption capense (A) *Tahiti petrel, Pterodroma rostrata *Mottled petrel, Pterodroma inexpectata *Providence petrel, Pterodroma solandri (A) *Herald petrel, Pterodroma heraldica *White-necked petrel, Pterodroma cervicalis (A) *Cook's petrel, Pterodroma cookii (A) *Gould's petrel, Pterodroma leucoptera *Black- winged petrel, Pterodroma nigripennis *Grey petrel, Procellaria cinerea (A) *Streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas *Flesh-footed shearwater, Ardenna carneipes *Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacificus *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Short-tailed shearwater, Ardenna tenuirostris *Fluttering shearwater, Puffinus gavia *Little shearwater, Puffinus assimilis *Tropical shearwater, Puffinus bailloni Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus (A) *White-bellied storm petrel, Fregetta grallaria (A) *Polynesian storm petrel, Nesofregetta fuliginosa Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae *Band-rumped storm petrel, Oceanodroma castro (A) Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Great frigatebird, Fregata minor *Lesser frigatebird, Fregata ariel Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Australian pelican, Pelecanus conspicillatus (A) Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary.

They have stocky proportions and large feet('Megapode' means 'large foot' in Latin). They usually lay their eggs in a mound of warm compost or in a geothermally active area to incubate them, from which the chicks hatch fully developed and independent. Three extinct species are known from New Caledonia-one also known from Tonga, and the other two, one from Ile des Pins and the other from the Loyalty Islands, are both undescribed. *Pile-builder megapode, Megapodius molistructor (Ext) *Loyalty Islands megapode, Megapodius species (Ext) *Il des Pins megapode, Megapodius species (Ext) Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds.

They are sometimes erroneously called giant scrubfowl or giant megapodes. *New Caledonian giant scrubfowl, Sylviornis neocaledoniae (Ext) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *New Caledonian rail, Gallirallus lafresnayanus (E)-possibly extinct *Buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis *Baillon's crake, Zapornia pusilla (A) *Spotless crake, Zapornia tabuensis *White-browed crake, Amaurornis cinerea (A) *Australasian swamphen, Porphyrio melanotus *New Caledonian gallinule, Porphyrio kukwiedei (Ext) *Dusky moorhen, Gallinula tenebrosa Kagus Wild kagu at Rivière Bleue National Park, a refuge managed for the species Order: EurypygiformesFamily: Rhynochetidae The kagu or cagou is a long-legged grey bird found only in the dense mountain forests of New Caledonia. It is almost flightless. It builds a ground nest of sticks and lays a single egg. It is vulnerable to rats and cats which are introduced species on the island, hence it is now threatened with extinction. The remote habitat and rarity of this species mean that little is known of its habits. It formerly had a relative, the lowland kagu, which was about 15% larger. This died out after the first human contact with the island. *Kagu, Rhynochetos jubatus (E) *Lowland kagu, Rhynochetos orarius (Ext) Buttonquails Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Turnicidae The buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which resemble the true quails.

Most species are found in Africa but others occur in southern Europe, Madagascar, Australia and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies and usually elongated central tail feathers. All are colourful and have long downturned bills and pointed wings, which give them a swallow-like appearance when seen from afar. *Rainbow bee-eater, Merops ornatus Hornbills Order: BucerotiformesFamily: Bucerotidae An extinct hornbill from the genus Rhyticeros has been found on Lifou Island in the Loyalty Islands. The fossil is about 30,000 years old. The species has not been described yet and it is unclear whether it was found only on the Loyalty Islands or on them and New Caledonia proper. *Lifou hornbill, Rhyticeros species Swallows and martins Order: PasseriformesFamily: Hirundinidae The family Hirundinidae is adapted to aerial feeding. They have a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings and a short bill with a wide gape.

The term neonatal comes from neo, \\"new\\", and natal, \\"pertaining to birth or origin\\". Neonatal nursing requires a high degree of skill, dedication and emotional strength as the nurses care for newborn infants with a range of problems, varying between prematurity, birth defects, infection, cardiac malformations and surgical problems. Neonatal nurses are a vital part of the neonatal care team and are required to know basic newborn resuscitation, be able to control the newborn's temperature and know how to initiate cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry monitoring. Most neonatal nurses care for infants from the time of birth until they are discharged from the hospital. Levels of the Neonatal Nursery  There are four different levels of neonatal nursery where a neonatal nurse might work. The updated classification of neonatal levels by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) includes a Level IV. * Level I consists of caring for healthy newborns. Level I nurses are now uncommon in the United States. Healthy babies typically share a room with their mother, and both patients are usually discharged from the hospital quickly. * Level II provides intermediate or special care for premature or ill newborns. At this level, infants may need special therapy provided by nursing staff, or may simply need more time before being discharged. * Level III, the Neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU), treats newborns who cannot be treated in the other levels and are in need of high technology to survive, such as breathing and feeding tubes. Nurses comprise over 90 percent of the NICU staff. * Level IV includes all the skills of the level III but involves the extensive care the most critically and complex newborns. This facility will have 24-hour resident neonatologists and surgeons. They are involved with intricate surgical repairs like congenital cardiac issues and acquired malformations. Changes in neonatal care Neonatal care became a specialty in the United States in 1960 and that is the same year that the first NICU was established in the United States. There have been some major changes in the Neonatal Care over the past 120 years. Some of these changes include the invention of the incubator, changes in respiratory care, and the development of surfactants. The incubator An incubator is a plastic dome-shaped machine designed as a crib that regulates a newborn infant's body temperature. The incubator is designed to allow the temperature to be adjusted according to the state of the baby's current body heat. A range of five types of incubators all serve different purposes in the neonatal intensive care unit. The closed- box incubator is used to prevent infection that could be contracted the outside of the box; it filtrates the air and keeps the moisture fresh. The double-walled incubator keeps heat inside the box. Servo-controlled incubators are controlled by skin detectors which are designed to recognize the loss or gain of body heat and make adjustments to maintain the correct temperature. The open box incubator produces heat from beneath the baby to keep it warm. Portable incubators transport the newborn to and from different parts of the hospital. In 1880, Dr. Tarnier was convinced that the maintenance of internal temperature was key to the premature infant's survival. This led him to introduce the first human incubator. Inspired by chicken eggs hatching in an incubator, he asked a zoo keeper to design a similar incubator for premature infants. Dr. Delee expanded the use and function of the incubator by incorporating an oxygen chamber and an electric controlled thermostat which allowed the incubator to be transported in ambulances. thumb Respiratory care Administration of oxygen assists and generates oxygen intake for neonates. Oxygen administration began with a metal forked device in the nostrils, and it is now administered through thin plastic tubes in the nostrils, also known as nasal cannula. The first ventilation of an infant was in 1961 in a positive pressure situation, and mechanical ventilation was improved in 1971. Mechanical ventilation is the process in which a machine, attached to the patient, regulates breathing by pumping air in and out of the lungs. Another type of breathing mechanism used is the continuous positive airway pressure mask which attaches to the face to help with breathing. These masks were first used in 1973 as an alternate less invasive form of support. thumb Surfactants A surfactant allows a substance to get \\"wet\\" to help another substance dissolve. In 1910, the first study of the use of surfactants on infants took place in Japan. Surfactant therapy since has improved the infant mortality rate by 50%. Surfactants combined with the least invasive respiratory therapy (bubble CPAP or nasal CPAP) has greatly improved the infant mortality rate in the US.  Qualifications and requirements  United States Healthcare institutions have varying entry-level requirements for neonatal nurses. Neonatal nurses are Registered Nurses (RNs), and therefore must have an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. Some countries or institutions may also require a midwifery qualification. Some institutions may accept newly graduated RNs who have passed the NCLEX exam; others may require additional experience working in adult-health or medical/surgical nursing. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in neonatal nursing, such as the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) and various doctorates. A nurse practitioner may be required to hold a postgraduate degree. The National Association of Neonatal Nurses recommends two years' experience working in a NICU before taking graduate classes. As with any registered nurse, local licensing or certifying bodies as well as employers may set requirements for continuing education. There are no mandated requirements to becoming an RN in a NICU, although neonatal nurses must complete the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. Some units prefer new graduates who do not have experience in other units, so they may be trained in the specialty exclusively, while others prefer nurses with more experience. Intensive care nurses receive intensive didactic and clinical orientation, in addition to their general nursing knowledge, to provide highly specialized care for critical patients. Their competencies include the administration of high-risk medications, management of high-acuity patients requiring ventilator support, surgical care, resuscitation, advanced interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy procedures, as well as chronic-care management or lower acuity cares associated with premature infants such as feeding intolerance, phototherapy, or administering antibiotics. NICU RNs undergo annual skills tests and are subject to additional training to maintain contemporary practice. Europe Becoming a neonatal nurse isn't a simple task, as it requires a great deal of hard work and an interest in biology in order to be successful. A college degree is not needed. All neonatal care nurses are registered nurses or midwives with The Nursing and Midwifery Council. The first step to qualify is to complete a nursing degree. To gain entry into a nursing degree, it is required to have at least GCSE (A-C) in English, Mathematics and a science-based subject, and two to three A-levels with one being in a biological science. United Kingdom To be a successful neonatal nurse, it is recommended to have studied mathematics and science-based subjects in high school, such as Calculus, Chemistry, Algebra and Biology. Undergraduate college studies should consist of two years of foreign language, Mathematics and Science should be covered in three years, and after four years, there should be competency in English. The minimum requirement for a Neonatal nurse is to complete an associate degree in Applied Science. The time frame will last up to 2 years and can be completed at a community college or a junior college. Gaining an associate degree is sufficient, however a bachelor's degree will provide a wider range of career opportunities. A BSc in nursing degree curriculum or a BSN usually takes up to four years, and there is opportunity for a higher salary. This training program involves learning how to distribute vaccinations, and how to give the necessary and the basic care of patients. The coursework will be joined with the clinical experience to assist students in exploring several healthcare settings. Becoming qualified as a neonatal nurse involves the four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. To advance in a future career, it is best to aim to maintain an above 3.0 average grade in college. Students must pass the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) exam that is usually provided prior to earning their license. This allows them to be registered with the right of practice. When progressing further in continuing to practice as a neonatal nurse with the associate degree or bachelor's degree, it is advised to keep learning and continuing education. In order to become a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner, it is required to continue studying by completing a Master of Science in Nursing degree. Australia In Australia, a neonatal nurse first needs to be a Registered Nurse (RN) or Midwife. Two years of nursing experience are needed, as is practical experience and employment in the neonatal unit before being eligible to undertake postgraduate studies in neonatal nursing. This usually requires undertaking a Graduate Diploma Degree in Clinical Nursing. A Neonatal nurse examining a newborn baby.  Roles and responsibilities  Duties of a neonatal nurse usually include supplying vital nutrients to newborns, changing feeding tubes, administering medication, observing vital signs, performing intubations and using monitoring devices. In the common situation where premature and sick newborns' lungs are not fully developed, they must be certain infants are breathing and maturing properly. Neonatal nurses work together with upper-level nurses and physicians to facilitate treatment plans and examinations. Neonatal nurses can also work with speech-language pathologists who specialise in the assessment and treatment of feeding, swallowing and communication in preterm infants. They have regular interaction with patients' families, therefore are required to educate parents or relative on the infant's condition and prepare care instructions after the infant is discharged from the hospital. If parents have questions which neonatal nurses are incapable of answering, they may direct them to another medical staff member who is able to.  Academy of Neonatal Nursing  The Academy of Neonatal Nursing was founded in 2001 and serves as a professional organization for neonatal nurses. Nurses who belong to the organization have the ability to locate continued education, apply for scholarships and awards, and receive other benefits. They can also receive the Academy's healthcare journal, Neonatal Network.  APGAR scoring  All nurses working in a birthing centre have an important role in assessing the newborn immediately after birth. The assessment of the neonate's appearance (colour), pulse (heart rate), grimace (in response to unpleasant stimuli such as bulb suctioning the pharynx), activity (muscle tone and/or movement), and respiratory effort via the APGAR scoring system is essential to guide the baby's care (see Understanding the APGAR scoring system). The nurse is often directly responsible for assigning the APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life. Each of the five assessment areas is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. The maximum score possible is 10. Scores of 7 or above are considered normal for full-term newborns. If the total score is below 7, or any area is scored 0 at 5 minutes of life, resuscitation efforts and scoring should continue every 5 minutes until 20 minutes of life. At 10 minutes neonates with an APGAR score of 3 or lower are at risk of having neurological dysfunctions and cerebral palsy in the future although there is no guarantee. Despite how every individual's case varies; as time goes by with the score not improving the risk becomes higher. However, there are numerous other factors to take into consideration when determining future complications, an APGAR score cannot do it alone. Beyond assessing the five components that make up the APGAR score, it's essential to understand its meaning. The APGAR score assigned at 1 minute of life reflects how the fetus tolerated the in utero environment and/or the labor and delivery process. All subsequent APGAR scores reflect the newborn's response to interventions during the transition from intrauterine to extra- uterine life. There are, however, multiple different factors that can impact the APGAR score which include anesthesia, gestational age and initial lower oxygen. These nursing interventions include keeping the baby warm, stimulating the baby to breathe, giving breaths to the baby who isn't breathing well, and performing chest compression if needed.

TIG1 is a transmembrane protein which contains a hyaluronic acid binding motif. This particular motif suggests that it may increase cell-to-cell contact in cells which express TIG1 (Jing et al., 2002). TIG1 is predicted to contain a membrane anchor at the N-terminus. TIG1 contains two faces: the first face contains homology to the protein latexin, and the second contains a broad basic patch. The basic face is thought to be an interaction surface. Supporting the idea of a protein interaction surface, TIG1 also contains a cis-peptide bond between isoleucine-122 and proline-123 on a protruding loop that lies on its basic face (Aagard et al., 2005). Latexin and TIG1 have approximately 30 percent homology based on primary structure; however, their three-dimensional structures are thought to be much more similar (Liang et al., 2007). Both latexin and TIG1 are thought to have descended from a common progenitor. TIG1 also shares homology with another protein, ovacalyxin-32, although the evolutionary and functional relationship between the two proteins is unclear (Gautron et al., 2001).  Function  TIG1's specific functions are still being elucidated. Latexin is a structurally similar protein to TIG1. Latexin is the only mammalian carboxypeptidase inhibitor, although TIG1's proteolytic activity remains unexplored. Using a selective subtractive differential gene display, Jing and colleagues discovered that TIG1 expression was absent from malignant prostate carcinoma cell lines but present in benign tumor lines. When highly malignant prostate cancer cells were transfected with TIG1, decreased in vitro invasiveness was measured using an extracellular matrix migration assay over a period of 48 hours. This same group of scientists performed another experiment in which TIG1 expression was restored in mice that were homozygous for the deletion of the TIG1 gene. Although the restoration of TIG1 did not prevent tumor growth in these mice, the average size of the tumors showed a 2.4-fold decrease (Jing et al., 2006).  Regulation  The promoter of TIG1 is silenced by hypermethylation in gastric cancer. Promoter hypermethylation is a common mechanism for silencing tumor suppression genes. During carcinogenesis, methylation begins at the CpG island of the promoter and gradually works its way to the transcription start site, at which point it inhibits transcription of TIG1 (So et al., 2006). Additionally, the CpG promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 has also been demonstrated as an important event in the carcinogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma (Cho et al., 2007).

Survey observations were commenced in 2005. UKIDSS consists of five surveys covering a range of areas and depths, using various combinations of five near-infrared filters.  Description  UKIDSS as a large-scale near infrared survey follows 2MASS and anticipates the VISTA telescope in the Southern hemisphere. It aims to cover 7500 square degrees of the Northern sky. Four particular areas of investigation for UKIDSS are: \\"the coolest and nearest brown dwarfs, high-redshift dusty starburst galaxies, elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters at redshifts 1 < z < 2, and the highest-redshift quasars, at z = 7\\".UKIDSS Home Page. Retrieved April 30, 2007. The UKIDSS data become available online to the ESO community immediately upon entering the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA), and are then released to the world 18 months later.  Surveys  Of the five surveys in UKIDSS, two are directed towards Galactic targets and three are optimized for extra-Galactic observations. The surveys are described here in decreasing order of area. The letters refer to spectral regions; e.g. JHK is a combination of near-infrared filters, more or less synonymous with \\"the near-infrared\\".  Large Area Survey (LAS)  The LAS (extra-Galactic) covers an area of 4000 square degrees in YJHK to a depth of K = 18.4. This area has previously been covered at optical wavelengths in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. While the high Galactic latitudes covered by the LAS make it suitable for observations of sources outside the Milky Way, the survey also targets Galactic sources, incorporating a second pass in J to measure proper motions of nearby stars.  Galactic Plane Survey (GPS)  The GPS (Galactic) covers an area of 1800 square degrees in JHK to a depth of K=19.0, with 300 square degrees also covered through a narrow-band H2 filter. The motivation for the GPS is to obtain a clearer view of the Galactic Plane than is possible at optical wavelengths, due to absorption by material in the disk of the galaxy.  Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS)  The GCS (Galactic) covers an area of 1400 square degrees in JHK to a depth of K=18.7. The area is distributed over ten open star clusters with the aim of measuring the mass function in a variety of Galactic environments.  Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS)  The DXS (extra- Galactic) covers an area of 35 square degrees in JK to a depth of K=21.0 with 5 square degrees also imaged in H. The survey fields are at high Galactic latitudes with low extinction, and are chosen to overlap with deep observations made at other wavelengths.  Ultra Deep Survey (UDS)  The UDS (extra-Galactic) covers an area of 0.77 square degrees within the XMM-LSS field (which is contained within the DXS) in JHK to a depth of K=23.0. This is the deepest near-infrared survey yet conducted over such an area of sky, with the aim of studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe.

Graves was one of the Philadelphian cricketers that played from the end of the 19th century through the early years of the next. He was born in Philadelphia and played a total of 34 first-class matches before entering a successful career in manufacturing. Graves began his first-class career for the Gentlemen of Philadelphia on September 14, 1894. This match was played on the Germantown Cricket Club ground against a team of Players of United States of America. Graves scored no runs in the two-day match which ended in a draw. As he was only 14 years old at the time, Graves' poor showing is hardly surprising. Four years later, Graves again played with the Philadelphians, this time against Sir Pelham Warner's touring side. This time he was one of the opening batsmen, though his performance in the loss still left something to be desired. Graves played in several other series against touring English sides while attending the University of Pennsylvania. He then joined the Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1903. It was against Lancashire on July 6 of that year that Graves reached his highest run total. In the first innings at Old Trafford, he made only 19 runs but in the second he helped the Philadelphians to their nine wicket victory with a 103 not out. This score took 105 minutes to achieve and included 9 fours. His second highest first-class score came a month earlier against Nottinghamshire with a 62 not out. His highest recorded scores came during non-first class matches. One came during a match against Scotland on the same tour. This match saw Graves reach a score of 107. In 1898 he hit 128 against Canada. Graves continued his international career during a tour of the Marylebone Cricket Club in the United States. The side played two matches against the Philadelphians in 1905. He also joined the Philadelphian tour of England in 1908. In his last first-class match against Kent County Cricket Club on August 27, Graves only managed 7 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. After his cricket career came to an end, Graves entered the business world. Earning a great deal of wealth in manufacturing, he purchased the Christian Admiral Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey, although he subsequently declared bankruptcy in 1914. Graves died in Germantown, Pennsylvania on March 31, 1918 at the age of 37.

There is some uncertainty as to his identity.Broughton, pp. 200–202. Controversy Traditionally the consul of 265 has been identified as the same Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges who had previously been consul in 292 and 276 BC. This Gurges was the son of Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, and is usually regarded as the father of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus. Livy describes Verrucosus as the grandson of Rullianus, and thus the son of Gurges, but passages in Plutarch and Pliny referring to Verrucosus as the great- grandson of Rullianus imply the existence of an intervening generation.Livy, xxx. 26.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Fabius Maximus\\", 13, 24.Pliny, vii. 33. Although Verrucosus is said to have served as an augur for sixty-two years at the time of his death in 203 BC, and thus would have been at least a young man in 265, the interval between his first consulship, in 233 BC, and that of Gurges, in 292, supports the hypothesis that he was Gurges' grandson, rather than his son. If Verrucosus was the grandson of the consul of 292 and 276 BC, then one hypothesis holds that the Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges who was consul in 265 was the son of the Gurges who had been consul in 292 and 276; he would also be the father of Verrucosus, and make the latter the great-grandson of Rullianus, as described by Plutarch and Pliny. This view was suggested by Karl Julius Beloch and Attilio Degrassi.Beloch, Römische Geschicte, p. 458, note 1. An alternative hypothesis, however, holds that there was only one Gurges, who was consul in 292, 276, and 265, and that Verrucosus was the son of another Fabius Maximus, perhaps the Quintus Fabius who, as curule aedile in 266 BC, insulted the envoys of Apollonia in Epirus, and was given over to the people of Apollonia for punishment, only to be returned by them unharmed.Livy, Epitome xv.Valerius Maximus, vi. 6. § 5. This Fabius would have been the son of Gurges, and had his public career cut short by his own indiscretion. This view was suggested by the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, and later followed by Münzer.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 993 (Q. Fabius Maximus, no. 3).Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft (Fabius, nos. 30, 112, 116).

Appearing as a serial in the Japanese manga magazine Feel Young from 1998 to 2002, the thirty-three chapters of Doll were collected into six bound volumes by Shodensha and published from August 2000 to August 2002. Taking place in the future, the plot focuses on relationships between people and the eponymous androids; the series has an overarching plot that follows an illegal reprogrammer of Dolls and his revenge against the corporation which creates them. One of the characters, the corporation that manufactures the Dolls, and the concept of the Dolls appeared earlier in Mihara's short manga (1995), later collected in IC in a Sunflower (1997). In 2003, Tokyopop licensed the series for an English-language translations in North America and the United Kingdom, publishing the series from August 2004 to October 2005. The series has received several positive reviews from English-language critics, and the first volume placed in ICv2's list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels for July 2004. In 2011, Tokyopop's North American branch stopped publication and returned its manga licenses. Plot Set in the future, Doll centers around relationships between humans and the eponymous androids—created by Kaoru and Motohiko Kirishima and manufactured by SG Corporation. During the development of the \\"Sterol-2\\" Doll, Kaoru's mental condition begins to deteriorate; after attempting to retain a copy of her mind and memories in a prototype of a Doll, Motohiko realizes his mistake of trying to replace his wife. Retiring from the corporation to care for her, he leaves behind eight other prototypes, which are seen throughout the series: a nameless male Doll, who was the constant companion for a woman and cremated with her by her greedy stepson; Chocolat, a maid who was discovered in a trash heap by an elderly farming community; Honey, a secretary loyal to the SG Corporation president; Cherry, the maid to an award-winning, bulimic writer; Vanilla, a maid to an elderly man and his unfaithful, younger wife; the sexaroid Veronica, one of two Dolls built for sexual intercourse, and her unnamed partner; and S, who hunts down illegally reprogrammed Dolls for SG Corporation. Doll also focuses on Ichiro, a reprogrammer of Dolls who was abused by his stepmother and stepsiblings. Chosen to become the next president of SG Corporation, he was castrated by his beloved Doll on the orders of his jealous relatives. His Doll, the only one who had shown him kindness, was then destroyed. No longer the successor, Ichiro studied all the aspects of the Doll business. At eighteen years old, he left and began to reprogram Dolls illegally, seeking revenge on SG Corporation. Years later, Ichiro finds the unnamed sexaroid, after Veronica is destroyed by a sadistic owner. Ichiro reprograms the sexaroid to mimic human emotions, and the sexaroid becomes Ichiro's companion. They eventually find and purchase Vanilla, who acts as if she suffers from psychological trauma. While on a date with the sexaroid, Vanilla recovers her memories of having been ordered to bury her master's corpse by her mistress. Meanwhile, Ichiro is captured by agents of the SG Corporation. Learning of this, the sexaroid leaves to rescue him, against the wishes of another reprogrammer, Psycho Candy. Captured, tagged for destruction, and reunited with Ichiro, the sexaroid finds himself ordered by Ichiro to switch places with him and escape. Ichiro then gives the sexaroid a name, Itsuki. With Itsuki's tag for destruction, Ichiro is killed at the moment his father finally recognizes him. Doll concludes with SG Corporation's scandal and subsequent bankruptcy, as Motohiko and his wife are content with knowing that they left Dolls in the world, while Vanilla and Itsuki live together in a house purchased by Ichiro. Development The character Vanilla, the concept of the Dolls, and SG Corporation first appeared in manga artist Mitsukazu Mihara's earlier short manga (1995), later collected in IC in a Sunflower (1997). Doll began as \\"the simple notion of humans vs. robots\\". Although she often uses Lolita fashion—a clothing style influenced by the Rococo style and the Victorian and Edwardian eras—in her character designs as a way to convey the duality of her characters, she felt that the fashion failed to give the manga depth. She then centered the plots on the psychological aspects. As Mihara has expressed an interest in exploring the impact of the childhood environment on a person, especially his or her relationships with parents, the stories in Doll involve the eponymous androids and family life. Each short story contains an independent theme; \\"A Maid Servant\\", for example, takes its inspiration from a book about aging fears, and \\"miseducation\\" serves as the theme for a story about cram school, inspired by a book about the inadequacy of solely teaching theories. The overarching plot of Doll started with the second volume; she envisioned a prodigy burdened by \\"parental pressure\\" and a Doll to heal the psychological pain. She explained that while her flaws may appear in the human characters, her \\"hopes for perfection\\" may appear in the Dolls. The Dolls, however, never developed consciousness, with the remodeled Dolls only capable of mimicking human emotion—in contrast to the typical progression of other stories in the genre. Mihara never considered making the androids capable of emotion, wishing for the narrative to center on the human characters. Release Written and illustrated by Mitsukazu Mihara, the thirty-three chapters of Doll appeared as a serial in the Japanese josei (targeted towards women) manga magazine Feel Young, from 1998 to 2002. The chapters were collected into six bound volumes by Shodensha and published from August 10, 2000, to August 8, 2002. In 2003, Tokyopop licensed Doll for an English-language translation in North America and the United Kingdom. The series was published from August 10, 2004, to October 11, 2005; the first volume was also published as a limited-edition hardcover on May 11, 2004. Tokyopop's North American branch stopped publishing on May 31, 2011, with its manga licenses returned. Doll has also been translated into German by Tokyopop Germany. Volume list Reception The first volume of Doll debuted at the 73rd spot on ICv2's list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels for July 2004 with an estimated 1,394 copies sold. Doll has received several positive reviews from English-language critics. About.com's Deb Aoki placed it on her list of recommended horror manga. According to Aoki, Mihara's stories proved to be haunting, despite not following the traditional model of gory horror stories. While finding Mihara's art well-done, yet \\"not especially memorable\\", Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that Mihara's focus on the social effects of the Dolls and their environments greatly contributed to the appeal of the series. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil wrote that Doll examines the relationships between androids and people on \\"a much more serious and realistic level\\" than Clamp's Chobits. In follow-up reviews, she wrote that the series conveyed \\"a sense of reality that is unsettling and the stories are harsh reads—being violent and/or tragic.\\" According to her, Doll simultaneously examines the meaning of humanity and modern-day fears surrounding the possibility of such androids. She also wrote that Mihara's \\"jaw-dropping beautiful\\" artwork contrasted well with the characters' misery. Jason Thompson, in Manga: The Complete Guide, wrote that childbirth and family served as the manga's themes. According to him, Mihara's character designs and artwork complemented the stories nicely. Conversely, Anime News Network's Liann Cooper reviewed the hardcover edition of Doll with mixed feelings: according to her, the stories mostly lacked entertainment value, and had artwork that failed to catch the reader's eye, but she praised the presentation. She concluded that the hardcover edition would only appeal to \\"avid collectors\\".

He played seven seasons for the San Francisco 49ers. He was originally drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 1946 NFL Draft. Grgich was known as a tough and sometimes vicious two-way lineman who loved to intimidate Norm Van Brocklin. Grgich was also known for his rousing pep talks prior to games and was even brought back by Coach Frank Albert to give pep talks after his playing days were through. At the end of his pep talk, Grgich would say \\"This is the way you've gotta do it!\\" and would promptly deliver a forearm shiver to the nearest door, wall or even one of the wooden support posts in Kezar Stadium which was rumoured to be felt throughout Kezar Stadium. He is distinguished as being the first Yugoslav to play in the National Football League. Grgich's playing career was ended by a knee injury in 1952, at which time he became a car salesman until former coach Buck Shaw demanded he turn to coaching. Grgich became the head football coach at Oakdale High School, in Oakdale, California in 1957 and 1958. He later became the offensive line coach for several years at Oakdale High School. In 1985, Visco and other Grgich family members competed on an episode of Family Feud against the Hatfield family. Grgich taught drivers education at Oakdale High School until he retired in 1986. As a teacher he was greatly loved by his many students who quickly learned you could derail a day's instruction at the mere mention of the San Francisco 49ers, at which time Grgich would bring out old reel movies of San Francisco 49ers games from his playing days. In 1982 his students raised money to pay his way to Detroit to watch his beloved San Francisco 49ers play the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI. Visco continued to live in the Oakdale, California area until he was moved to Dale Commons assisted-living facility in Modesto, California shortly prior to his wife Grace, the country and western singer known as \\"Sioux City Sue,\\" died in 2001. Visco and Sue had 4 children, Steve, Vikki, Toni and Mike. Visco died Monday December 26, 2005 at a Modesto, California hospital.

According to tradition, his ancestors had already erected a chapel here, which was consecrated by Bishop Altmann of Passau in 1083. In 1612 a Baroque castle was erected in the nearby village of Harmannsdorf, which became known as the residence of Nobel laureate Bertha von Suttner (1843–1914).

History The idea of selecting media content in the interest of enhancing one's states has been proposed by Zillmann and Bryant (1985) and Zillmann (1988a). Initially, the assumptions were referred to as theory of affect-dependent stimulus arrangement, but subsequently gained more prominence under the label of mood management (Knobloch, 2006). Mood management research may be traced back to Leon Festinger's (1957) cognitive dissonance theory. Festinger notes that the human organism tries to establish internal congruity among cognitions such as attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about oneself and the environment. When a person holds two cognitions that are incompatible, dissonance is produced. But such dissonance can be reduced through selective exposure, that is, individuals will seek out information that will reduce the dissonance and avoid information that will increase the already existing dissonance. Festinger's theory was primarily laid out in cognitive terms, addressing exposure choices to persuasive messages. Zillmann and his colleagues thus proposed the mood management theory that attempts to cope with the broadest possible range of message choices such as news, documents, comedies, dramas, tragedies, music performances, and sports. It deals with all conceivable moods rather than a single, specific affective state, such as dissonance (Zillman, 1988b). Fundamental assumptions Based on the hedonistic premise that individuals are motivated for pleasure and against pain, mood management theory states that, to the extent possible, individuals tend to arrange their environment so that good mood (commonly pleasure) is maximized or maintained, and bad mood (commonly pain) is diminished or alleviated. Environmental arrangement can take many forms, including psychically moving away from or avoiding situations that creates negative effect (such as avoiding a stressful traffic jam), or moving toward or selecting situations that result in gratification (such as strolling in a beautiful garden). Moreover, since entertainment provides its audience with the opportunity to symbolically arrange the environment, mood management theory states that people's entertainment choices should similarly serve the management of moods (Oliver, 2003). The specific hypotheses of mood management theory have been summarized as follows by Zillmann (2000): > The indicated hedonistic objective is best served by selective exposure to > material that (a) is excitationally opposite to prevailing states associated > with noxiously experienced hypo- or hyperarousal, (b) has positive hedonic > value above that of prevailing states, and (c) in hedonically negative > states, has little or no semantic affinity with the prevailing states. Although mood management suggests that individuals' behaviors often conform to the hedonistic assumption, this theory also makes clear that individuals are not necessarily aware of their motivation. Rather, people are thought to initially arrange their environments in a random fashion, and arrangements that are incidentally made during good moods and that extend or enhance the hedonically positive state leave a memory trace that increases the likelihood for making similar stimulus arrangements under similar circumstances (Zillmann, 1988a, 1988b). In other words, the formation of these preferences is controlled by a mechanism called operant conditioning, which refers to the use of consequences to modify the occurrence and form of behavior. Empirical evidence Although its principles relate to the broader realm of mood optimization, mood management theory has largely been applied to entertainment choices. Focusing on viewers' selection of television entertainment, for example, an experimental study by Bryant and Zillmann (1984) reveals that individuals can overcome boredom or stress through selective exposure to exciting or relaxing television programming respectively. In the context of music exposure, Knobloch and Zillmann (2002) demonstrate that individuals could improve negative moods by electing to listen to highly energetic-joyful music. Also, Wakshlag et al. (1983) reported that participants with increased fear levels preferred films with low victimization scores and with high justice scores. This demonstrates that individuals aim to minimize stimuli which are associated with the source of a negative mood. Challenges The theoretical proposition of mood management theory has been faced with challenges, especially when studying (1) the role that negative moods and burdening feelings play within the entertainment experience; (2) the diversity of individual users, social and cultural situations, and media products on offer, and (3) the new, so-called interactive media and how entertainment can best be conceptualized within them (Vorderer, 2003).

The proceeds of the Lottery go to the Minimum Foundation Program that funds public education in Louisiana. The daily activities involved with running the cooperation are handled by the president of the Louisiana Lottery Cooperation. The president is under the supervision of the Lottery's nine-member governing board of directors. The Lottery offers full and part-time employment in a total of 6 different cities in the State of Louisiana. Over half of the Lottery sales are for prize expenses. Not only does the government receive revenue from the Lottery, but businesses do as well. The minimum age to purchase a ticket is 21 years olds. However, to sell or receive a Lottery ticket there is no minimum age. All drawings are conducted at the Lottery headquarters in downtown Baton Rouge using automated drawing machines, and they are videotaped. Drawings happen every evening (excluding some holidays). The LLC uses three methods to choose random numbers for each of the Lottery's games. Before each drawing, the drawing method and machine are selected randomly. There are a total of 7 in- house games that could be played. Winners that are U.S. citizens are subject to Louisiana income tax withholding and can also have federal tax withheld if winnings are $5,000 or more.  History  The Louisiana Lottery Corporation (LLC) began in 1991, after the 1990 Louisiana legislature proposed a government-run lottery (ACT 1045) as a way to generate revenue without increasing taxes. Due to the Lottery's unique operations, the Legislature recognized a corporate structure would suit it best. Voters also liked the idea, passing a constitutional amendment in 1990 creating the LLC by a 69% to 31% margin. In 2003, voters passed another constitutional amendment to dedicate Lottery proceeds to the Minimum Foundation Program that funds public education in Louisiana. Today's Lottery is not the first in Louisiana; in 1868, a group of entrepreneurs began a private business, the Louisiana State Lottery Company. It promised to donate $40,000 annually for 25 years to Charity Hospital in New Orleans in exchange for the hospital not having to pay taxes. Tickets were sold nationwide to make it the largest lottery in the country. After charges of corruption, it moved to Honduras, ending 22 years later. The president of the Louisiana Lottery Corporation handles the daily activities involved with running the corporation under the supervision of the Lottery's nine-member governing board of directors. Board members are appointed to staggered terms from each of Louisiana's seven congressional districts; one member is chosen from a list of five candidates submitted by the Louisiana Oil Marketers and Convenience Store Association; and one member is appointed at-large. Each member is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Louisiana Senate before beginning a four-year term. Louisiana's treasurer serves as an ex-officio board member.  Operations  To ensure the highest level of accountability, the following have varying degrees of oversight over the corporation, including its budget, drawings and administrative rules. *Governor of Louisiana *Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget *Senate Judiciary B Committee *House Committee on Administration of Criminal Justice *Attorney General *Board of Directors In addition to an annual \\"clean bill of health\\" from the Legislative Auditor, the LLC continues to receive national recognition for excellence in financial reporting. The LLC ranks first among jurisdictional lotteries for percentage of revenue transferred to its government. Operating solely from self-generated revenue, the Lottery contributes more than $100 million yearly to the Minimum Foundation Program that funds public education in Louisiana. Staffing and offices The Lottery employs a total of about 140 people (full-time and part-time) in its downtown Baton Rouge headquarters, distribution center, as well as in its regional offices in New Orleans, Lafayette, Alexandria, Shreveport, and Monroe. Regional staff process and pay winning tickets and support Lottery retailers, including training, monitoring product inventory and point-of-sale opportunities, assisting with in-store promotions resolving problems, explain new games and changes, and ensuring compliance with Lottery rules. Operational management functions, including sales, accounting, auditing, marketing, public relations, human resources, security, and information systems, are conducted from the Lottery's corporate headquarters. The Lottery's distribution center oversees inventory management and instant ticket order fulfillment. Distribution of monetary funds More than half of Lottery sales are reserved for prize expenses. Prizes not claimed are returned to winners in the form of increased payouts on scratch-off tickets. Players have won more than $2.8 billion in Lottery prizes since the Lottery's inception. The Lottery statute mandates that 35 percent of all Lottery revenue be transferred to Louisiana's treasury. Effective July 1, 2004, the Louisiana constitution provides that Lottery proceeds be earmarked for the Minimum Foundation Program, which funds public education in Louisiana. In addition, the first $500,000 in annual Lottery proceeds are earmarked for the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals-Office of Addictive Disorders to fund problem gambling programs. As of July 2009, the Lottery has transferred over $2 billion to Louisiana's treasury. In fiscal year 2009, more than $135.9 million was transferred, which is the highest amount since 1993. The LLC ranks first among U.S. lotteries in percentage of revenue transferred to its government. More than 2,700 businesses in Louisiana earn a 5 percent commission on the sale of Lottery products as licensed retailers. In addition to revenue from commission, retailers earn an incentive of up 2 percent for cashing winning tickets up to $600. Retailers are also paid a selling bonus of up to 1 percent on the sale of top-prize winning tickets for Lotto, Easy 5, or Powerball (1% of Louisiana's contribution to the jackpot's cash value; for Powerball, a minimum bonus of $25,000). Retailer commission and incentives totaled $19.7 million in fiscal year 2009. The Lottery retains less than 10 percent of its revenue to fund operations, including its headquarters, five regional sales offices where players claim winning tickets, technology for generating tickets and conducting drawings, ticket printing, advertising, promotions, and staffing. The US and Louisiana governments consider winnings from all forms of gaming to be income for tax purposes. By law, the LLC must report winnings from each ticket with a prize value over $600 to the Internal Revenue Service, and the Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation. Income tax regulations require the LLC to withhold 25 percent federal taxes, and 5 percent Louisiana taxes, from prizes of more than $5,000. A gambling income statement, W2-G, is mailed to the claimant by January in the year following the payment of the prize. The W2-G is mailed to the address entered on the claim form unless the Lottery is notified of an address change before the W2-G is issued. Minimum purchasing age According to Louisiana law, Lottery ticket purchasers must be at least 21 years old. Individuals who sell tickets are required to obtain proof of age through a valid current drivers' license, ID card, passport, or military/federal ID containing a photo and date of birth. Individuals who are at least 21 can give Lottery tickets to a person under 21 as a gift, although minors must be accompanied by a legal guardian or a family member who is at least 21 to claim a Lottery prize. Underage people can sell Lottery tickets if they meet the minimum employment age of 14, and are employed by a licensed Lottery retailer. The 21 minimum age requirement to purchase Lottery tickets was changed from 18 in 1998 to coincide with the age requirement for most other forms of gaming in Louisiana, which is one of only three jurisdictions (Arizona and Iowa are the others) that requires ticket purchasers to be at least 21. Becoming a retailer The Lottery licenses retailers to sell all of its products (draw-style and scratch-off tickets.) In selecting retailers for licensure, the LLC considers the applicants': *financial responsibility *integrity *reputation *accessibility of the business or activity *security of the premises *projected sales volume *whether sufficient retailers already exist to serve public convenience Because of the considerable investment of equipment and sales support the Lottery makes for on-line retailers, potential retailers are scrutinized to ensure an adequate return on this investment in making the decision to grant or renew a license. The following are the minimum qualifications to be considered for a retailer license: *Current in filings and payment of all taxes, interest, and penalties owed to any political subdivision, including the Louisiana Workforce Commission (formerly the Louisiana Department of Labor), Louisiana Department of Revenue, and the Louisiana Secretary of State. *Having no conviction of any illegal gambling activity, false statements, false swearing, perjury, or a crime punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment or a fine of more than $1,000. *Not a vendor or employee of the corporation or residing in the same household as an officer of the corporation. *Having never made a false statement of material fact to the corporation. *Compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Drawings  Drawings for Louisiana-based games are conducted at Lottery headquarters in downtown Baton Rouge. They are videotaped and conducted in a special room secured by alarms and motion detectors. Each drawing is conducted using one of two secure automated drawing machines. Automated drawing machines are stand- alone computers that are essentially random number generators that are completely separate from the system that generates tickets, so the number of winners and where the winning tickets were sold is not known until after the drawing has occurred. Louisiana-based drawings are held every evening, except on Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, beginning at approximately 9:30 pm, after confirming that client sales have ceased and are verified. Tickets for Lotto, Easy 5, Pick 3, and Pick 4 must be purchased by 9:30 p.m. on draw nights. Powerball tickets must be purchased by 9:00 p.m. on draw nights. The public is welcome to attend any drawing, but must reserve a seat by contacting the Lottery during regular business hours. Drawings for Pick 3 and Pick 4 are held daily, while drawings for Easy 5, Lotto, and Powerball are held only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Powerball, the Lottery's multi-jurisdictional game, is conducted live at 9:59 p.m., Central Standard Time on Wednesdays and Saturdays by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. One of three methods in choosing random numbers is used for each of the Lottery's games. These are burned on to the \\"read only\\" memory of a microchip. The microchips are secured in the systems' central processing unit, and a protective seal makes tampering impossible. Access to the room and machines is reliant upon a dual key and password system from a Lottery drawing official and a legislative auditor. Prior to each drawing, the drawing method and machine are randomly selected. After both drawings are conducted, the official winning numbers generated by the system are transmitted to Louisiana Public Broadcasting, WLPB, for satellite relay to all participating television stations and are faxed to news media. The Lottery also posts the winning numbers on its Web site following the drawings each night. The LLC discontinued live drawings for its in-house games in 1998, ahead of a current industry trend toward automated drawings. How to Claim a Prize *1. Prizes of $600 or less can be claimed at participating Lottery retailers. *2. Non-jackpot prizes under $510,000 can be claimed at any Lottery office. *3. All prizes can be claimed at Lottery headquarters in Baton Rouge. Powerball prizes over $510,000 and Lotto jackpots must be claimed at Headquarters. *4. Prizes can also be claimed by signing the winning ticket and mailing it, along with a claim form, to: :Louisiana Lottery Corporation :Attn: Prize Validations :P.O. Box 90010 :Baton Rouge, LA 70879 Draw game prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the drawing in which the prize was won. Scratch-off prizes claims must be made within 90 days after the announced closure of the game. Powerball jackpot winners have 60 days after claiming their prize to select cash or annuity. The LLC is required to report all prizes greater than $600 to the IRS and the Louisiana Department of Revenue. For winners with a U.S.-issued Social Security number, prizes of $5,000 or more are subject to Louisiana income tax withholding, and also have federal tax withheld. Unpaid child support owed by the winner may also be withheld. Annuitized prizes are the property of the winner's estate in the event of death. Lottery tickets are bearer instruments, which means that the Lottery must pay the holder of a winning ticket presented for payment. Signing the back of the ticket is the single most important thing one can do to help protect themselves from theft and demonstrate ownership of the ticket. Any alteration to a winning ticket worth more than $600 is cause for an immediate security investigation. Once a winning ticket has been paid, however, it is much more difficult to determine whether another individual was the rightful owner. By law, the Lottery can pay a winning ticket only once. Lottery games Current in-house games =Pick 3= In 1992 the LLC launched its second draw-style game, Pick 3. It lets players choose their own play style and wager to win up to $500 on a $1 bet, or $250 on a 50¢ bet. Players pick any three-digit number on a playslip or choose Quick Pick. Pick 3 has four ways to play. By playing a \\"straight\\", players must match their three digits in exact order to win. By playing a \\"box\\", players can match their three digits in any order. By playing a \\"straight/box\\" players combine a 50-cent \\"straight\\" play and 50-cent \\"box\\" play. Or, by playing a \\"combo\\", players can match three digits in any order to win a \\"straight\\" payout. Bettors can play their numbers up to seven consecutive days. Drawings are held daily except Christmas and Easter, when no Louisiana-based drawings are held. =Pick 4= The LLC launched Pick 4 on March 1, 1999, with daily drawings. Players pick any four digits, 0 through 9, or use Quick Pick to randomly generate the numbers on up to five different plays on one ticket, after also deciding how to play each number. Players can win up to $5,000 for a $1 play or up to $2,500 for a 50-cent play. Bettors can play their numbers up to seven consecutive days. =Easy 5= Easy 5 was relaunched in 2007, replacing Cash Quest, which replaced the original version of Easy 5 in 1998. It offers players the chance to win a pari-mutuel jackpot of at least $50,000 for matching 5 numbers from a field of 37. Any game with at least 2 matches wins; overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 8. If a player chooses to use ezmatch, the Lottery's terminal will print five ezmatch numbers on the ticket, along with a corresponding instant prize for each number. Players matching any of the five ezmatch numbers to any of the regular Easy 5 numbers on their ticket win the ezmatch prize for that number. =Louisiana Lotto= Louisiana Lotto began in January 1992; it draws 6 of 40 numbers. In 1995, the LLC began paying Louisiana Lotto jackpots as cash instead of a 20-year annuity. It offers a pari-mutuel jackpot of at least $250,000 that keeps growing until it is won. In 1998, a $3 prize level for matching 3 of the 6 numbers was added, decreasing the odds to 1 in 30. The game is structured to average $2,000 and $50 for the match 5 and match 4 prize levels respectively. =Powerball (multi-lottery game)= In 1995, the LLC joined the flagship game operated by MUSL. Powerball jackpots begin at $20 million, increasing if there is no top-prize winner. The game features a double matrix: 5 of 59, and 1 of 39. The advertised Powerball jackpot represents an estimate of the annuity, which, if chosen, is paid in 30 annual installments that increase by 4 percent yearly. The first installment is paid when the prize is claimed. Winners can instead choose the cash option, which is the cash in the jackpot pool. The cash value represents the amount of money MUSL would have invested to purchase the annuity. In 2001, the PowerPlay option was introduced. For an additional $1 per play, bettors can multiply a non-jackpot prize by up to 5. Before the Powerball drawing, a PowerPlay multiplier is randomly selected. The match-5 second prize (five white balls) automatically is a 5x win on a PowerPlay wager. Overall odds are 1 in 35. In January 2012, Powerball will become a $2-per-play game; with PowerPlay, $3. =Mega Millions (multi- lottery game)= Perhaps surprisingly, Louisiana did not participate in the cross-selling expansion of Mega Millions and Powerball on January 31, 2010. As of October 27, 2011, there are 46 US lotteries; 43 offer Mega Millions and Powerball, while California offers only Mega Millions. With Powerball becoming a $2-per-play game in January 2012, Louisiana decided to pursue adding Mega Millions, which has always been $1 per play; $2 with the Megaplier option (there are no plans to raise the price of a Mega Millions ticket.) Mega Millions became available in Louisiana on November 16, 2011. Former Louisiana Lottery games *On March 16, 1997, the LLC began offering the MUSL game Daily Millions, which began in 1996. It was drawn daily, including Sundays, and cost $1 per play. However, MUSL discontinued the game on April 19, 1998, because of unexpectedly rare occurrences of top prize wins. *The LLC launched the in-house game Cash Quest on October 12, 1998, replacing its original version of Easy 5. Low sales finally resulted in the game's end on September 15, 2007. At that time, the Lottery launched a new version of Easy 5. *On September 9, 2000, the LLC was part of the launch of MUSL's Rolldown. When no ticket won the top prize, it filtered down to lower prize levels. The game ended in April 2002. Since then, except for Powerball, the LLC has not offered a MUSL game. Scratch-offs As the name indicates, players scratch off a protective coating on a ticket to find out if they're an instant winner. A selection of 30 to 40 scratch-offs featuring Louisiana, holiday, casino, and other themes are introduced yearly. From 1 million to 3 million tickets of each game are printed, with new games launched monthly. Scratch-off prizes have varied from a free ticket to $1 million. The Lottery offers $1, $2, $3, $5 and $10 scratch-off games. In general, higher priced tickets have higher prize values, lower overall odds of winning, more chances to win on a ticket, and higher payout percentages. When the last top prize in a game is claimed, sales cease, and the game is closed.

Saunderson was the eighth and only surviving son of George Saunderson, 5th Viscount Castleton and his first wife Grace Belasyse, daughter of Henry Belasyse. He was educated at Laughton and was admitted at Magdalene College, Cambridge on 19 November 1681, aged 14 and admitted at Gray's Inn in 1686. He was appointed to the alienations office in 1689, probably to reward his father for his support of King William in the Glorious revolution and succeeded to the stewardship of the manor of Kirton on the death of his elder brother, Nicholas, in 1693. He travelled abroad to Germany, Austria, Italy, Spanish Netherlands and France from 1695 to 1698. He attended Padua University in 1696. Saunderson was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Newark at the 1698 English general election He was considered a Court supporter, and voted against the disbanding bill on 18 January 1699. He was defeated in the first general election of 1701 but succeeded in regaining his seat at the second general election of 1701. He was returned again in a contest at the 1702 English general election and was unopposed at the 1705 English general election. He held the office of Vice-Admiral of Lincolnshire from 1705 and the stewardship of the honor of Tickhill from 1708, retaining both for the rest of his life. At the 1708 British general election, he was again returned unopposed. He voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710 and lost his seat again in the 1710 British general election. In 1711 he was a Commissioner for taking subscriptions to the South Sea Company. He did not stand at the 1713 British general election. In 1714 Saunderson succeeded his father as 6th Viscount Castleton in the Irish peerage. He was created Baron Saunderson of Saxby, Lincolnshire in 1714,and Viscount Castleton in the English peerage in 1716. He was created finally Earl Castleton of Sandbeck in 1720. Saunderson died unmarried at Richmond on 23 May 1723 ‘after a long illness’. All his titles became extinct and his estates passed to his cousin Thomas Lumley (later 3rd Earl of Scarbrough), who thereupon took the additional surname of Saunderson, by Act of Parliament.Burkes Peerage (1939 edition, s.v.

It was introduced in 1958, following four years of development. This timing coincided with the launch of the stereophonic phonograph record. It was introduced to the market by RCA in 1958.RCA Victor Announces Major Break-Through in Recorded Sound The main advantage of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience.Stereo Goes Back On Tape Popular Mechanics, September 1960, P. 205 The user is not required to handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both supply and take-up reels, the cartridge does not have to be rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs. The same design concept would later be used in the more successful Compact Cassette, introduced by Philips in 1962. Similar to the Compact Cassette, the RCA cartridges are reversible so that either side can be played. An auto-reverse mechanism in some models allows the tape to run continuously. Equal to 8-track tape and Stereo-Pak, the tape runs at a standard speed of 3.75 inches per second (IPS).RCA Sound Tape Cartridge (1958 – 1964), Museum Of Obsolete Media, retrieved 22 September 2016 This is double the speed of the Compact Cassette and half of the top speed of consumer reel- to-reel tape recorders, which usually offer both 3.75 IPS and 7.5 IPS speeds. Such consumer reel-to-reel machines are capable of superior audio performance, but only at the faster speed. The RCA tape cartridge format offers four discrete audio tracks that provide a typical playtime of 30 minutes of stereo sound per side, or double that for monophonic sound. Some models can also play and record at 1.875 IPS, doubling playing time with a significant reduction in sound quality.Cartridges and Cassettes, Vintage Cassettes, retrieved 22 September 2016 This speed was of too low quality for music on these machines, but was acceptable for voice recording. With two interleaved stereo pairs, the track format and speed of the RCA tape cartridge is the same as that of consumer reel-to-reel stereo tape recorders run at 3.75 IPS. It is possible to dismantle the cartridge, spool the tape onto an open reel, and play it on such a machine. In fact, RCA offered an adapter for their Sound Tape Cartridge machines to enable them to both play back and record traditional reels of tape up to 5 inches in reel diameter. Unlike the Compact Cassette, the RCA tape cartridge incorporates a brake to prevent the tape hubs from moving when the cartridge is not in a player. Small slot windows extend from the tape hubs toward the outside of the cartridge so that the amount of tape visible on each spool can be seen. Despite its convenience the RCA tape cartridge was not much of a success. RCA was slow to produce machines for the home market. They were also slow to license prerecorded music tapes for home playback. Cost was also an issue, with a single cartridge costing US$4.50 in 1960 ($ with inflation today) compared to a 1,200 foot (365 m) reel of tape, which cost $3.50 ($ today). The format disappeared from retail stores by 1964. The physical tape width and speed of the tape and even the size of the RCA tape cartridge is similar to, though incompatible with, Sony's Elcaset system, introduced in 1976. That system also failed to achieve much market acceptance and was soon withdrawn.

Maryland's largest Mega Millions jackpot winner was for the March 30, 2012, drawing, which produced the then-world's-largest jackpot, approximately $656,000,000. A ticket sold at a Baltimore County 7-Eleven won a one-third share of the jackpot. (The other tickets were sold in Illinois and Kansas.) As with the other two sets of winners in that drawing, the ticket holder(s) chose the cash option, rather than the 26 yearly payments.

It is long and extends northwest from Sörling Valley to Barff Point, its farthest extremity. It was probably first seen by the British expedition under James Cook in 1775. The peninsula as a whole takes its name from Barff Point, which was named for Royal Navy Lieutenant A.D. Barff of , who, assisted by Captain C.A. Larsen, sketched a map of Cumberland Bay in 1906. Barff Point is considered the eastern headland of East Cumberland Bay.  Named features  The coastline of Barff Peninsula is irregular and marked by indented bays and coves, with headlands and points projecting out into the sea. Many of these features have been charted and named. Cave Point is a headland lying southwest of Barff Point. The name appears to be first used on a 1929 British Admiralty chart.  Northeast coast to Godthul  North off Barff Point, from the coast, are the Right Whale Rocks, separated from the point by Merton Passage. The name Merton was originally given to the rocks by personnel of Sappho in 1906, but was reassigned to the passage by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel as a result of surveys during the period 1926–30. east-southeast off the coast of Barff Point is Alert Rock, a submerged rock marked by breakers. It was charted in 1929 by DI personnel, who named it after the Alert, a small motor launch used during the survey. Continuing east along the coast, the next major feature is Cape Douglas. It was charted by DI in 1926–1930 and probably named after Sir Henry Percy Douglas, a member of the Discovery Committee, 1928–1939. Mills Peak stands inland southwest. Cape Douglas ends at Lucas Point, which marks the west side of a small bay called Rookery Bay, bordered on the east by Rookery Point. The bay and its headlands appear to be first named on a 1930 British Admiralty chart. The Skrap Skerries, a group of small islands and rocks, are situated off the coast just north of Rookery Bay. Martin Valley trends northeast-southwest across the peninsula from Rookery Bay to Cumberland East Bay. It was originally called \\"Three Lakes Valley\\", but to avoid confusion with Three Lakes Valley on Signy Island, it was renamed by UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1988, after Stephen J. Martin, British Antarctic Survey Station Commander at Grytviken. MS Expedition at Godthul East of Rookery Point, Skua Point, first named on a 1930 British Admiralty chart, marks the western extent of Cobblers Cove, a small cove providing an anchorage. Babe Island lies in the entrance to the cove. Both were charted by DI personnel in 1929, who named the cove \\"Pleasant Cove\\". The South Georgia Survey (SGS) of 1951–1952 reported that this feature was known to whalers and sealers as Skomaker Hullet, because it was first entered in thick fog by a Norwegian gunner who had once been a cobbler. An English form of this name, Cobblers Cove, was approved. To the south, Long Point divides Cobblers Cove from Godthul. It was charted in 1928 by a Norwegian expedition under Harald Horntvedt, then recharted in 1929 by DI personnel, who named the point for Walter Hume Long. O'Connor Peak stands inland to the west of Long Point.  South of Godthul  Godthul, meaning \\"good hollow\\" in Norwegian, is a bay long entered between Long Point to the north and Cape George to the south. It once served as a whaling station. Szielasko Ice Cap sits on the south edge of the harbor. Briggs Point projects into Godthul from its eastern shore, dividing it from Alsford Bay to the east. The name appears on a DI chart from 1929, and is probably for A.C. Briggs, a member of the DI survey party. Alsford is a small bay between Briggs Point and Cape George, charted by DI in 1929 and named after Stoker W.B. Alsford, of , a member of the survey party. Reindeer Valley cuts southwest across the peninsula between the head of Godthul and Sandebugten in Cumberland East Bay. It was surveyed by the SGS between 1951-1957, and named by UK-APC because Norwegian whalers introduced reindeer into this part of the island in 1909. The wreck of in Ocean Harbour in 2014 Cape George was discovered in 1775 during the second voyage of Captain James Cook, who named it for George III of the United Kingdom. Tucked south of it is Horseshoe Bay, wide, first charted by DI personnel. East-southeast of the cape is a rocky ridge called Nansen Reef, submerged to a depth of about . It was named after , which struck this reef and sank on 10 November 1906. Continuing southward, the next major feature is Johannsen Loch, a cove long. The name first appears on a DI chart, but may reflect an earlier naming. Ocean Harbour, a former whaling station, sits to the south. Kelp-infested Penguin Bay lies just southeast. Its name first appears on a 1931 British Admiralty chart. To the south, prominent Tijuca Point forms the northwest side of the entrance of Hound Bay on the north coast of South Georgia. The name Penguin Point was probably applied to this feature by DI personnel in 1930. Following the SGS, it was recommended that the name be altered to avoid confusion with other features named for penguins. The name Tijuca Point was given by UK-APC for , a three-masted barque built at Nantes in 1866.

Following the South Georgia Survey, 1951–52, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee proposed that the name be altered to Cumberland East Bay and that all other names be rejected. This change brings together information about the whole of Cumberland Bay in one place in indexes, and will avoid confusion with East Bay in Prince Olav Harbour, South Georgia. On 22 April – 24 April, 1982, during the Falklands War, the British Special Boat Service attempted to cross Cumberland East Bay. They had landed in Hound Bay, and traversed the Sörling Valley, but were prevented from attacking Argentine positions by incessant ice and snow.Bicheno, Hugh (2006) Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War. London. Weidenfeld & Nicolson.  Major features  Many features within the bay have been individually charted and named by various Antarctic expeditions and surveys. Western coast The western headland of the bay is Sappho Point on Thatcher Peninsula. Working south along the west coast, the next major feature is King Edward Cove, approximately southwest. South of that, the glacial plain Hestesletten extends from inland out to the coast. Moraine Fjord forms the west head of the bay, separated from it by Greene Peninsula. Nordenskjöld Glacier flows into the head of the main portion of Cumberland East Bay. Eastern coast The bay is defined to the east by Barff Peninsula, culminating in Barff Point to the north. Along that coast, the small cove Sandebugten forms the west end of Reindeer Valley. The name \\"Sandebugten\\" appears on a 1929 British Admiralty chart but probably was applied earlier by Norwegian whalers operating from South Georgia.

It is entered southward of Larsen Point, where it is wide, and extends in a southwest direction. It is separated from Cumberland East Bay by Thatcher Peninsula. This feature was first surveyed by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04, who named it \\"West Bay\\". It was remapped during 1926–29 by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel and renamed \\"West Cumberland Bay\\". The shortened form West Bay was simultaneously used.

This change brings together information about the whole of Cumberland Bay together in indexes.  Named features  Cumberland West Bay has a complex coastline, many of whose features have been charted and individually named. They are described here beginning at the north on the west coast of the bay, and proceeding southwest. Northwest coast The headland Larsen Point forms the west side of the entrance to Cumberland Bay. It was named for Captain Carl Anton Larsen, who visited Cumberland Bay in the Jason in 1893–94. The Crutch is a saddle-shaped col on a ridge, located northwest of Larsen Point. It was charted and descriptively named by DI personnel in the period 1925–1929. Jason Island, named for the ship, is located north of Larsen Point. Allen Bay is a semi-circular bay wide, lying west-northwest of Larsen Point in the northern part of Cumberland West Bay. It was charted in 1926 by DI personnel on the Discovery, and was named by them, probably for H. T. Allen, a member of the Discovery Committee at that time. The next notable feature is Jason Harbour, which itself has a number of named features. Southwest of Jason Harbour, Enten Bay shallowly indents the coast. The name \\"Entenbucht\\" (duck bay) seems to have been first used on a 1907 chart of Cumberland Bay by Dr. A. Szielasko, of the Norwegian whaler Fridtjof Nansen, who published an account of his natural history observations made at Cumberland Bay during the previous year. Enten Bay's east side is marked by Doubtful Point. Tweeny Point lies southwest of Doubtful Point. Both of these points were first named on a 1929 British Admiralty chart. Continuing to the west is another small bay, Carlita Bay. It was initially named Horseshoe Bay, probably during the survey of Cumberland West Bay by HMS Dartmouth in 1920. This name was later accepted for a bay close south of Cape George, less than away. In 1957, UKAPC renamed the feature after the Carlita, a whale catcher built in 1907 and owned by the Compañía Argentina de Pesca. Islet Point, first named on the 1929 Admiralty chart for the islet just off the point, marks the east side of the entrance to Carlita Bay.  Southeast coast  Mercer Bay, a small bay marked by Geikie Glacier at its head, sits at the southwest end of Cumberland West Bay. The bay appears on a sketch map of Cumberland Bay by Lieutenant S. A. Duse of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, and is first used on a chart based upon survey work by DI personnel in 1926–30. It was probably named for Lieutenant Commander G. M. Mercer, Royal Naval Reserve, captain of the DI research ship William Scoresby. To the east, Teie Point separates Mercer Bay from Harpon Bay. Teie Point was named by UK-APC for the sailing vessel Teie, owned by Tonsberg Hvalfangeri. To the east of Teie Point is wide Harpon Bay, first mapped by the SAE and named by UK-APC for the cargo vessel Harpon, built in 1897, which had been used by the Compañía Argentina de Pesca.

Initiated under the authority of Public Act 239 in 1972, the games collect funds to support Michigan’s public school system. History The Michigan Lottery began when the Green Ticket game started on November 13, 1972. Hermus Millsaps of Taylor, Michigan won the first $1 million prize on February 22, 1973. When he won, Mr. Millsaps was 53 years old, a native of Tennessee and worked at a Chrysler Automobile plant. He and his wife spent all their money on bus fare to Lansing and the first Michigan Lottery Commissioner, Gus Harrison, had a lottery agent drive the couple home.https://blogpublic.lib.msu.edu/red- tape/2018/feb/february-22-1973-hermus-millsaps-taylor-wins-first-michigan- lottery-million-dollar/ On October 7, 1975, the first instant game ticket was purchased. Terminal-based games commenced on June 6, 1977, when the Daily 3 game was introduced. The first \\"Michigan Lotto\\" game was introduced on August 13, 1984. The first The Big Game (now Mega Millions) ticket was sold on August 31, 1996. Since its commencement, the Michigan Lottery has donated more than $20.7 billion to the School Aid Fund. Lottery Products The Michigan Lottery offers a number of games in different styles of play, including: * “Scratch-off” games; * Terminal-based games, where drawings are held to pick winning numbers. These include Mega Millions, Lotto 47 and Powerball; * Pull- tabs, which are similar to scratch tickets; however, players pull perforated tabs instead of \\"scratching off\\" the ticket; * Online versions of scratch-off games, as well as digital tickets for terminal-based games, available for purchase through the internet. Lottery tickets are offered to the public through more than 10,000 licensed Michigan Lottery retailers, as well as online at the Michigan Lottery's website. Scratch games To play Michigan Lottery scratch games, a player scratches off a ticket; each game consists of different themes, play styles and prize structures. The Lottery averages over 70 new scratch games per year. These games are priced from $1 to $30, with prizes up to $4 million. Terminal-based games Tickets for these games are sold from lottery terminals connected to a central system. Lottery drawings are held to determine the winning numbers. Depending on the lottery game, drawings are held four minutes apart (Club Keno), twice a day (Daily 3 and Daily 4), daily (Fantasy 5 and Keno!) or twice a week (Powerball, Mega Millions, and Classic Lotto 47). Current draw games In-house draw games =Daily 3 and Daily 4= Players select either a three- or four- digit number; to win, the player's number must match exactly the number drawn. Optional methods of play allow players to box their numbers; matching the winning number's digits in any order wins a lower payout. =Fantasy 5 + ezMatch= Fantasy 5 began on September 12, 2004, replacing a game called Rolldown. Players select 5 of 39 numbers. Jackpots begin at $100,000 with drawings held daily. Fantasy 5 jackpots increase by a minimum of $5,000 per drawing if there is no top-prize winner. Fantasy 5 results are shown on the nightly version of the Michigan Lottery Show. \\"ezMatch\\" is a separate game that can be purchased and played separately from the nightly draw. The game functions as a terminal-based instant game, offering prizes ranging from $2 to $500. =Lotto 47 + ezMatch= Introduced on May 15, 2005, Lotto 47 replaced Winfall. Players pick 6 of 47 numbers. Lotto 47 drawings are held twice weekly with jackpots starting at $1 million. The odds of winning the jackpot are approximately 1 in 11 million. As with Fantasy 5, \\"ezMatch\\" is an add-on game to Lotto 47. Prizes offered are identical to those of Fantasy 5's ezmatch. Unlike Daily 3 & 4 (which draw numbered balls), Keno!, Lotto 47 and Fantasy 5 are drawn using a random number generator (RNG). In-house Club Games Added in 2003, Club Games consist of the Club Keno game and pull-tabs, available mostly in social settings, such as bars, restaurants, and bowling centers. =Club Keno= For Club Keno players choose up to 10 numbers out of 80. With results displayed on television sets three and a half minutes apart, the Lottery draws 20 numbers. Wagers are $1 to $20; the top prize is $100,000 for a $1 bet. In 2010, Club Keno was made available to all retailers across the state. =Pull-tabs= With top prizes ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, pull-tab games are similar to “scratch-off” games. Instead of scratching off a ticket, a player pulls perforated tabs. =Keno!= Initiated in 1990, Keno! players select 10 numbers out of 80. During the daily drawings, 22 numbers are chosen. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000. Players also win money by matching 9, 8, 7, or 6 numbers. There also is a prize for matching zero numbers, which is a $1 scratch ticket (rather than a free Keno! play). Keno! results are available online shortly after each drawing Multi-jurisdictional games =Lucky for Life= Lucky for Life is a lottery drawing game available in 23 states and the District Of Columbia. Players select 5 numbers from 1-48 and a sixth number from 1-18. Prizes range from $1 to $1,000 per day, every day, for the winner's life. =Mega Millions= On September 6, 1996, six lotteries (including Michigan's) began The Big Game. It became Mega Millions six years later. Players select six numbers from two number pools: 5 numbers from 1 through 70, and the Mega Ball number (1 through 25) for a chance to win a multimillion-dollar jackpot. Currently, Mega Millions jackpots begin at $40 million (annuity value), and increases when there is no top prize winner. Drawings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. Jackpot winners in Michigan, as with most Mega Millions jurisdictions, choose either the annuity (30 annual payments) or the cash option after winning. The Megaplier option, which multiplies a non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5, became available in Michigan in January 2011. =Powerball= Powerball began in 1992 and Michigan joined in 2010. Players select six numbers from two pools as in Mega Millions: five numbers 1 through 69, and the red Powerball (1-26). Jackpots begin at $40 million annuity. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays.http://www.michigan.gov/lottery/0,1607,7-110--230473--,00.html  Online Gaming  In August 2014, the Michigan Lottery re-launched its website, giving players the opportunity to buy tickets for some draw games and a host of \\"virtual\\" scratch-off games over the internet. Over time, the selection of games has evolved to include nearly all draw-based terminal games (the well- known exceptions are Daily 3 & Daily 4), several different versions of instant Keno games, and many different virtual scratch-off games. Prizes for online games range vary depending on the cost of the ticket purchased, but can be as high as $500,000. In order to purchase these online games, a player must be a Michigan resident, as well as physically present in the state when playing.

Rotational diffusion is the counterpart of translational diffusion, which maintains or restores the equilibrium statistical distribution of particles' position in space. The random re- orientation of molecules (or larger systems) is an important process for many biophysical probes. Due to the equipartition theorem, larger molecules re- orient more slowly than do smaller objects and, hence, measurements of the rotational diffusion constants can give insight into the overall mass and its distribution within an object. Quantitatively, the mean square of the angular velocity about each of an object's principal axes is inversely proportional to its moment of inertia about that axis. Therefore, there should be three rotational diffusion constants - the eigenvalues of the rotational diffusion tensor - resulting in five rotational time constants. If two eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor are equal, the particle diffuses as a spheroid with two unique diffusion rates and three time constants. And if all eigenvalues are the same, the particle diffuses as a sphere with one time constant. The diffusion tensor may be determined from the Perrin friction factors, in analogy with the Einstein relation of translational diffusion, but often is inaccurate and direct measurement is required. The rotational diffusion tensor may be determined experimentally through fluorescence anisotropy, flow birefringence, dielectric spectroscopy, NMR relaxation and other biophysical methods sensitive to picosecond or slower rotational processes. In some techniques such as fluorescence it may be very difficult to characterize the full diffusion tensor, for example measuring two diffusion rates can sometimes be possible when there is a great difference between them, e.g., for very long, thin ellipsoids such as certain viruses. This is however not the case of the extremely sensitive, atomic resolution technique of NMR relaxation that can be used to fully determine the rotational diffusion tensor to very high precision.  Basic equations  For rotational diffusion about a single axis, the mean-square angular deviation in time t is : \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\theta^2\\\\right\\\\rangle = 2 D_r t, where D_r is the rotational diffusion coefficient (in units of radians2/s). The angular drift velocity \\\\Omega_d = (d\\\\theta/dt)_{\\\\rm drift} in response to an external torque \\\\Gamma_{\\\\theta} (assuming that the flow stays non-turbulent and that inertial effects can be neglected) is given by : \\\\Omega_d = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_\\\\theta}{f_r}, where f_r is the frictional drag coefficient. The relationship between the rotational diffusion coefficient and the rotational frictional drag coefficient is given by the Einstein relation (or Einstein–Smoluchowski relation): :D_r = \\\\frac{k_{\\\\rm B} T}{f_r}, where k_{\\\\rm B} is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. These relationships are in complete analogy to translational diffusion. The rotational frictional drag coefficient for a sphere of radius R is : f_{r, \\\\textrm{sphere}} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\eta R^3 where \\\\eta is the dynamic (or shear) viscosity. The rotational diffusion of spheres, such as nanoparticles, may deviate from what is expected when in complex environments, such as in polymer solutions or gels. This deviation can be explained by the formation of a depletion layer around the nanoparticle. Rotational version of Fick's law A rotational version of Fick's law of diffusion can be defined. Let each rotating molecule be associated with a unit vector \\\\hat{n}; for example, \\\\hat{n} might represent the orientation of an electric or magnetic dipole moment. Let f(θ, φ, t) represent the probability density distribution for the orientation of \\\\hat{n} at time t. Here, θ and φ represent the spherical angles, with θ being the polar angle between \\\\hat{n} and the z-axis and φ being the azimuthal angle of \\\\hat{n} in the x-y plane. The rotational version of Fick's law states : \\\\frac{1}{D_{\\\\mathrm{rot}}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} = abla^{2} f = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\left( \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} f}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^{2}} . This partial differential equation (PDE) may be solved by expanding f(θ, φ, t) in spherical harmonics Y^{m}_{l} for which the mathematical identity holds : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin\\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\left( \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y^{m}_{l}}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} Y^{m}_{l}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^{2}} = -l(l+1) Y^{m}_{l}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) . Thus, the solution of the PDE may be written : f(\\\\theta, \\\\phi, t) = \\\\sum_{l=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{m=-l}^{l} C_{lm} Y^{m}_{l}(\\\\theta, \\\\phi) e^{-t/\\\\tau_{l}} , where Clm are constants fitted to the initial distribution and the time constants equal : \\\\tau_{l} = \\\\frac{1}{D_{\\\\mathrm{rot}}l(l+1)} .

The Roman Oluklu Bridge (Olukluköprü) over a tributary gorge and the Bugrum Bridge over the Kocadere stream were engineering feats of their time. Getting there The park, rich in flora and fauna and noted for its wild beauty, is from Antalya. Northeast of Antalya on the Side road, take the turnoff for Taşağıl and Beşkonak to reach Köprülü Canyon National Park. A circular scenic route criss-crosses, passing through extensive forests and over waterfalls.

Amphibious Construction Battalion TWO is its sister unit based in Little Creek, Virginia. Mission ACB-1's primary mission is to provide Ship to Shore transport of combat cargo, bulk fuel and water, and tactical camp operations supporting Amphibious Ready Group, Marine Expeditionary Force, Brigade sized operations, Combined/Joint Logistics Over the Shore (C/JLOTS), and Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) Operations. History World War II – 104th Naval Construction Battalion ACB-1 was originally commissioned at Camp Peary, Williamsburg, Virginia, 16 July 1943, as the 104th Naval Construction Battalion and was sent to Camp Endicott, Gulfport, Mississippi. During World War II CBs sent to the Pacific were attached to one of the four Amphibious Corps: I, III, and V were U.S. Marine Corps (under Admiral Nimitz, CINCPOA, Pearl Harbor) while VII Amphibious Corps was U.S. Army (under General MacArthur, SWPA, Brisbane, Australia). During WWII there were five battalions tasked with pontoons, barges and the building of ship to shore causeways: CBs 70, 81, 111, 128, and 302.U.S. Marine Corps WWII Order of Battle, Gordon L. Rottman, Greenwood Press, 88 Post Road Weat, Westport, CT, 2002, p. 31 The 104th was attached to VII Amphibious group in 1943 and sent to Gamadodo, Milne Bay, New Guinea; Australia in 1944; and Leyte, Philippine Islands, 1945. During these two years, the 104th completed numerous land based construction projects ranging from an airfield on Los Negros Island, in the Admiralties, to Naval Air Station Cubi Point on island of Leyte in the Philippines. The battalion was eventually deactivated in Dec 1945. In January 1947, the 104th was reactivated and first began their Amphibious mission when the unit was tasked with \\"the assembly and placement of pontoon structures, beach rehabilitation, harbor development, salvage, and training of reservist in these operations\\". In October 1950, it was recognized by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Forrest Sherman, that the 104th and 105th NCBs had specialized capabilities that separated them from the other Naval Construction Battalions and were re- designated Amphibious Construction Battalion One and Two.

In the September 1950, invasion of Inchon a pontoon causeway was brought into Inchon Harbor on D-Day plus 1 to be used a tide level landing. General Douglas MacArthur came ashore over this pier on D plus 2. A month after 15 September 1950, landing at Inchon, ACB-1 moved to the east coast of Korea and again supported the 1st Marine Division. This time they landed at the port city of Wonsan as part of the 1st Marine Division's shift from the Inchon-Seoul area to the northeast coast of Korea. While the Marines moved north to positions in the Chosin Reservoir area, the Seabees built piers and unloaded ships. *On 21 September 1950 a detachment from ACB 1 went into Seabee history. Aerial reconnaissance reported eight locomotives trapped by broken rail lines in the Yong Dong Po switch yard eight miles North of Inchon. The 10 Seabees, led UT Chief Bloomer, volunteered to attempt to liberate the engines from behind enemy lines. Adjacent to the switch yard was a Kirin Beer Brewery where the Seabees liberated cases of beer to be returned to the South also. They fired the engines and repaired the rails as they went returning to American lines.104 NCB The Korean War: The Inchon landing,Naval History and Heritage Command, U.S. Navy Seabee Museum, UTC Donald T.

Most recently, in January 2003, ACB-1/2 was deployed to Kuwait Naval Base, Kuwait in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Moving over of cargo, on nine C-5 Galaxy aircraft, the PHIBs constructed the largest Logistics Support Area (LSA) in ACB history, housing over 4,500 personnel. Additionally, ACBs were instrumental with the complete download of 13 MPF ships encompassing three MPSRONs. ELCAS-M was also deployed to move thousands of ammo containers from ship to shore. A small detachment from ACB-1 also moved forward in Iraq to assist the NMCBs with the anchoring of a floating bridge. In 2005 ACB 1 took part in the U.S. military's Operation Unified Assistance response to the Indian Ocean tsunami. Unit Awards In recognition of outstanding services rendered in the Korean War, personnel of the Battalion received three Bronze Stars, eight Navy Commendations with Combat \\"V\\"s, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and numerous letters of recognition for meritorious services. During the Vietnam War, the Battalion was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

They were produced by Fiat Ferroviaria (now Alstom), and could tilt up to 8°. History Part of the Pendolino family, it was an updated version of the ETR 460 adapted for services under lines electrified at 3 kV DC in Italy and at 15 kV 16⅔ Hz AC in Switzerland and Germany. ETR 470 trains were used for fast services between Italy and Switzerland. Nine sets of nine coaches each were built, together with a 3-car prototype (\\"Train 0\\") which has never been used for commercial service. Since the dissolution of Cisalpino they were split between SBB (4 sets) and Trenitalia (5 sets). SBB planned to retire its 4 sets in 2014 at the latest. They are to be replaced by Stadler EC250 trains by 2019, and with ICN and RABe 503 trains in the interim. Because of its long series of breakdowns, the ETR.470 was very poorly received in Switzerland. The maintenance costs were four times higher compared to the ICN. The final decision to retire the trains was taken after one of them caught fire on 17 May 2009 in Ambri. The spokesperson for the Swiss Association for Transport and Environment described them as \\"not worthy of the Swiss Federal Railways\\", while the chief executive of Swiss Federal Railways said he wanted to \\"put an end to this horror\\". After unsuccessful attempts by SBB to sell the trains, three Swiss ETR 470 trainsets were scrapped in November 2015.. ETR 470 009 owned by SBB has been leased to Trenitalia since March 31, 2017 after an Italian ETR 610 has been very seriously damaged in an accident (derailment) in Lucerne on March 22, 2017. Export Presently, the Italian ETR.470 are used for Frecciabianca high-speed services. It was decided in 2019, that these will be used on the Athens – Thessaloniki railway line run by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane subsidiary, TrainOSE. Units will be converted for use in Greece, the existing 3 kV DC equipment is to be replaced with 25 kV 50 Hz equipment and they will be fitted with ETCS onboard equipment. In August 2018, a similar ETR.485 unit transferred to Greece for testing purposes, in anticipation of the ETR.470 fleet's arrival.

The bay is linked to Morsa Bay on the island's south coast by a mountain pass called Ernesto Pass.  Notable features  The northwest side of the bay's entrance is called Nameless Point. It was charted and probably named by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel in 1930. Cairns Cove is a small cove on the west side of Right Whale Bay. It was charted and named Haste Cove by DI, but that name was withdrawn by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1959. Following hydrographic survey from HMS Owen, 1960–61, the cove was named after Petty Officer Peter T. Cairns, a member of the survey group. Mount Regulator rises high and stands inland to the west of Cairns Cove. Binder Beach is a moraine beach at the head of Right Whale Bay. The name first appeared on a chart based upon a survey by DI personnel in 1930. Bloor Reef, located off Binder Beach, dries with the tide. It was named by the UK-APC for Leading Seaman Vincent T. Bloor, who assisted in the survey of Right Whale Bay in April 1961. Cairns Shoal is a small area of shoal lying west of Craigie Point in the east part of Right Whale Bay.

British scientists aboard the Undine visited the bay in 1911, while surveying South Georgia's coast. According to Fur Seals: Maternal Strategies on Land and at Sea 20,000 seals breed in Schlieper Bay. Whalers and other visitors inadvertently brought rats to South Georgia, which put bird populations at risk, as the rats stole and ate their eggs.

During the Falklands War (1982), the British magistrate and other civilians and military present in Grytviken were removed from South Georgia, but another 15 Britons remained beyond Argentine reach.

The EP signaled a drastic change in the band's sound, which also followed major lineup changes following the departure of lead vocalist Tim Maurer and trumpet player Aaron Bertram, and the untimely death of trombonist Ryan Dallas Cook. The band's previous release, Rump Shaker, was a poppy ska punk release, whereas Dance Like Nobody's Watching largely abandoned the ska influence in favor of a funk/disco-influenced sound, which would feature heavily in their following release, Infectious in 2007, and somewhat on 2008's Let's Be Friends, which featured a few ska tracks. The sudden genre change alienated some of the band's fanbase. This genre change was largely abandoned in favor of the band's original ska-influenced style with the release of Going on Tour in 2010 and Day Job in 2012. The EP's first five tracks are all-new, funk/disco-influenced pop rock, with a soft, melancholy piano rock version of \\"Bright Spring Morning,\\" a track from the group's 2003 album, Rump Shaker.

It has been ranked among the best plays ever made by The Independent, where it was described as a \\"deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era.\\" Plot synopsis The play opens in the photography studio of a man named Styles. The studio is located in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, South Africa. After reading a newspaper article on an automobile plant, Styles tells a humorous story to the audience about an incident that occurred when he worked at the Ford Motor Company. Styles continues to read the paper and talks about his photography studio. His musings are interrupted when a customer, Sizwe Banzi, arrives. He asks to have his picture taken, but when Styles asks him for his deposit and name, Sizwe hesitates, then says his name is Robert Zwelinzima. Styles asks Sizwe what he will do with the photo, and Sizwe tells him he will send it to his wife. When the picture is taken, the moment is frozen into what the photograph will look like. It comes to life and Sizwe dictates the letter to his wife that will accompany the photo. In the letter, Sizwe tells his wife that Sizwe Banzi is dead. He writes that when he arrived in Port Elizabeth from their home in King William’s Town, he stayed with a friend named Zola who tried to help Sizwe find a job. His employment search was unsuccessful; as a result, he was told by the authorities that he must leave in three days. Sizwe went to stay with Zola’s friend, Buntu. The play returns to the present time. Staying at Buntu’s house, Sizwe tells Buntu about his problems — unless a miracle happens, he will have to leave town in three days. Buntu is sympathetic to the problem and suggests he work in the mines in King William’s Town. Sizwe rejects the idea as too dangerous. Buntu decides to take him out for a treat at Sky’s place, a local bar. The focus switches back to Sizwe as he continues to compose the letter to his wife. He describes his experiences at Sky’s shebeen, where he was served alcohol by a woman in a respectful manner. The scene shifts to the outside of Sky’s after Sizwe and Buntu have been drinking. Buntu decides that he needs to get home to go to work tomorrow. He goes into an alley to relieve himself and finds a dead man there. Sizwe wants to report the body to the police. Buntu rejects the idea, but he retrieves the dead man’s identity book to find his address. Buntu finds that the man, named Robert Zwelinzima, has a work-seeker’s permit — the very thing that Sizwe needs to stay in town. They take the book. At Buntu’s house, Buntu switches the photographs in the books. He proposes that they burn Sizwe’s book — effectively making him dead — and have Sizwe adopt the dead man’s identity so he can stay in Port Elizabeth. Sizwe is unsure about the plan; in particular, he worries about his wife and children. Buntu contends that they can remarry. After much discussion, Sizwe agrees to the switch. Sizwe finishes dictating the letter to his wife. In it, he tells her that Buntu is helping him get a lodger’s permit. The scene shifts back to Styles’ photography studio; Sizwe is getting his picture taken. Critical account of play's genesis According to Marie Rose Napierkowski, in Drama for Students (Detroit: Gale, 2006; eNotes.com): > The genesis of Sizwe Bansi Is Dead can be traced to Fugard’s experiences as > a law clerk at the Native Commissioner’s Court in Johannesburg. At that time > it was required that every black and colored citizen over the age of sixteen > carried [sic] an identity book that restricted employment and travel within > the country. In court, Fugard saw the repercussions of this law: blacks were > sent to jail at an alarming rate. Although these restrictions are > specifically South African, critics have noted that the play’s greater theme > of identity is universal. Critics and scholars have also observed that Sizwe > Bansi Is Dead contains elements of absurdism, especially its sparse setting > and surreal subject matter.

Production history In 1972, Fugard directed the play's world premiere in Cape Town, followed the next year by a staging at London's Royal Court Theatre, which transferred to the Ambassadors, with Kani as Styles and Buntu and Ntshona as Robert/Sizwe. There, it won The London Theatre Critics award. After six previews, the Broadway production, presented in repertory with The Island, opened on 13 November 1974 at the Edison Theatre, where it ran for 159 performances. Kani and Ntshona jointly won Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Play for their performances in both Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island.\\"John Kani\\", Tony Awards past winners page.

The film documents the conversion of young Greek Military Police (ESA) recruits into torturers and touches on the subject of the power of the institution to compel otherwise moral human beings to torture. The documentary examines the processes and methods of the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. Plot The documentary dramatizes the recruiting and training of a number of young men into the Greek police force during the military junta rule. A number of otherwise decent young men are selected based on a number of traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters: illiterate, anti-communist, young and male, drawing comparisons to the Cambodian torturers at Tuol Sleng, many of whom were under 19 years old. The film also interviews Michalis Petrou, a conscript who served in the Military Police and was trained to become one of the most notorious torturers of the EAT-ESA. Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees. During the dramatic recreation of the training camps, the directors draw parallels to modern military recruit trainings and the methods used in the training of soldiers. Response The New York Times columnist Lawrence Van Gelder noted that while the film was technically flawed it was at the same time \\"memorable and unnerving\\" in its depiction of both the victims of the torture as well as the ordeals of the torturers themselves, and claimed \\"it is impossible to regard its torturers or its victims without realizing that the view may be a view into a mirror.\\" References External links *Select Filmography on Human Rights *Your Neighbor's Son at IMDB * in Danish and Greek with Danish subtitles. *1981 version on Vimeo in English and Greek with English subtitles.

Symptoms vary among patients, but other characteristics include a soft, high-pitched voice, partial webbing of the fingers and toes, palate deformations, genital abnormalities, language difficulties, and an aversion to crowds. The pathogenesis of the disease is yet to be identified, and no medical tests can definitively diagnose the disease. The primary method of diagnosis is to identify facial phenotypes. Since it was first described in 1965 by English physician Victor Dubowitz, over 140 cases have been reported worldwide. Although the majority of cases have been reported from the United States, Germany, and Russia, the disorder appears to affect both genders and all ethnicities equally.  Presentation Microcephaly is a characteristic in which the circumference of the head is smaller than normal due to improper development of the brain. It is caused by genetic disorders, infections, radiation, medications or alcohol abuse during pregnancy. Defects in the growth of the cerebral cortex lead to many of the features associated with microcephaly. Microcephaly has a vast range of prognoses: some patients experience little to very mental retardation and can reach regular age-appropriate milestones. Others may experience severe mental retardation and neuromuscular side effects.  Genetics  Although the pathology of Dubowitz syndrome is unknown, it is a heritable autosomal recessive disorder. Parents of people with Dubowitz syndrome are sometimes related, and there have been several cases of it occurring in monozygotic twins, siblings, and cousins. There is great variability in symptoms between cases, especially in intelligence. Although there is much evidence that Dubowitz syndrome is genetic, the symptoms are similar to fetal alcohol syndrome. Further studies are needed to determine whether alcohol influences whether Dubowitz syndrome manifests in people who are genetically vulnerable. Breakdown of chromosomes is known to occur.  Growth hormone  Dubowitz syndrome is accompanied by a deficiency in growth hormone. People with Dubowitz syndrome have stunted growth, and growth hormones are secreted by the anterior pituitary of the brain. The main function of the anterior pituitary is to increase height during development. Other functions include regulating the immune system, increasing calcium retention, increasing muscle mass and stimulating gluconeogenesis. A deficiency in growth hormone may be caused by genetic mutations, malformations of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland during development, or damage to the pituitary. In Dubowitz syndrome, the cause is likely the underlying mutations or disruption of brain structures during development. Growth hormone deficiency also correlates with low levels of IgG antibodies, a condition found in Dubowitz patients.  Relationship to Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome  Researchers are investigating the genetic similarities between Dubowitz syndrome and Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS). Patients with SLOS and Dubowitz syndromes have many of the same abnormalities, and the two disorders are hypothesized to be linked. Two characteristics of SLOS are a low cholesterol level and a high 7-Dehydrocholesterol level. Cholesterol is essential for several bodily functions, including maintaining cell membrane structure, embryogenesis, and synthesis of steroid and sex hormones. Impaired cholesterol synthesis or transport may account for most of the symptoms of both SLOS and Dubowitz syndrome. Although only a few patients with Dubowitz syndrome have been identified with altered cholesterol levels, researchers are exploring whether Dubowitz syndrome, like SLOS, is linked to a defect in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The pathology of Dubowitz syndrome is still unclear because of its rarity and the wide array of associated symptoms. Several studies have focused on different aspects of the disorder to try to find its exact cause and expression. One study examined the specific oral features in one patient. Another found abnormalities in the brain, such as corpus callosum dysgenesis, an underdeveloped anterior pituitary and a brain stalk with an ectopic (misplaced) posterior pituitary. Diagnosis There is no definitive test available for this condition. The diagnosis is based on the constellation of typical clinical features. Management There is currently no specific treatment for this condition. Management is supportive. In particular there is currently no known method of correcting microcephaly. However, there are a variety of symptomatic treatments that help to counter some of its adverse effects, such as speech and occupational therapies, as well as medication to control seizures and hyperactivity. Epidemiology This condition is rare with ~200 cases reported between 1965 and 2018.Innes AM, McInnes BL, Dyment DA (2018) Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in Dubowitz syndrome: Implications for diagnosis, management and further research.

In 2018, the university merged into Piedmont International University in Winston-Salem. Background Known for many years as John Wesley College, the college changed its name to Laurel University in 2011 and John Wesley University in June 2016. Some students lived on the rural campus, while others commuted. Classes were offered in person and online. The university contained schools of management and ministry and created North Carolina's first state-accredited online MBA program using avatar technology with a virtual business internship experiences for students. History John Wesley University was the oldest undergraduate theological education institution in North Carolina. It started in fall 1903 as the Greensboro Bible and Training School in Greensboro as a result of a revival held by Revs. Seth Rees and Charles Weigle. The school closed abruptly after the 1931 spring semester owing to insurmountable financial difficulties. Following an all- night prayer service with well-known former Methodist Episcopal Church South evangelist Jim H. Green (1880-1955), the group decided to reopen the Greensboro Bible and Literary Institute on January 15, 1932 in the same facilities with many of the same teachers and students. The new name was People's Bible School. The revamped school, which started with four faculty (from the previous institute) and 18 students, was later known as John Wesley College (1956), Laurel University (2011), and John Wesley University (2016). This college distributed the People's Herald periodical, later The Crusader. The college remained non-denominational while promoting a distinctively Wesleyan-Holiness view on entire sanctification, with fellow Methodist Evangelist John R. Church as its first board chairman. The college was influential in the founding of the People's Methodist Church, which later merged with the Evangelical Methodist Church. A small \\"chain of tabernacles\\" was created so ministry students would have inexpensive venues to preach and conduct revival services during the Great Depression.Green, Jim H., \\"Green Spots,\\" 1945, publisher unknown, pg. 94 Accreditation John Wesley University was accredited with the Commission on Accreditation of The Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), and the United States Department of Education. Graduates of the Christian Elementary Education program are eligible for certification with the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). The Bachelor of Arts in Management & Business Ethics and the Master of Business Administration—two degrees offered by the School of Management—were licensed by the University of North Carolina Office of General Administration. Academics John Wesley University offered Associate, Bachelor, Master's, and doctoral degrees.http://www.laureluniversity.edu Some bachelor's degree programs were designed specifically for adults to be completed at home or one night a week at school. Athletics John Wesley University was a member of the NCCAA and competed at the Division 1 level. Sports offered included: :*Men's Soccer :*Women's Soccer :*Women's Softball :*Women's Volleyball In 2014, operating as Laurel University - school leadership made a decision to bring athletics on to the campus in order to boost low enrollment and create a campus culture. In the beginning stages the university chose Men's/Women's Soccer and Lacrosse. After trying a few different approaches and looking for coaches, the school hired its first soccer coach Zachary Pierce. Pierce is a native of High Point North Carolina who thrived as youth player with the 75 High Point Stars, and as a four-year Varsity Starter at Ledford High School. In college Pierce played for Johnson & Wales University and Louisburg College; after college played briefly over overseas for a German club team Schwäbisch Hall. Returning from Europe and re-settling in High Point, Coach Pierce has been heavily involved with youth soccer for 20 years and remains a sought after, highly respected coach in the triad. During his youth coaching career Pierce garnered a winning record of 336-52-15, winning multiple cross state club titles. As Laurel University's head men's coach, Pierce single-handedly built a thriving program in a short 6 months. He actively recruited 80 student - athletes to compete in the NAIA & NCCAA D1 Southern States Conference. Along with recruitment and team building, Pierce solely negotiated usage of AJ Stadium for home matches, and the local Hartley YMCA for training facilities. In the university's inaugural year, Pierce assumed the NAIA Southern States Conference game schedule from Virginia Intermont, who's campus closed. The inaugural season produced a hard earned record 5-12, with a varsity program and team composed entirely of freshman and playing NAIA powerhouses: Southern Wesleyan University, Salem International, The Cumberlands University, West Virginia Tech, Columbia International, St. Andrews University, High Point University and others. Pierce left the University after the first year. Later the program thrived under Pierces's former assistant Coach Golding.

NFL Smith was the first blocking fullback selected when he was drafted in the 3rd round (65th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos, and the second true fullback behind only Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott. In April 2002, after six seasons in Denver, Smith was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. However, he was released before making an appearance and played for the Indianapolis Colts in 2002 and 2003. He was released by the Colts in early 2004. During his tenure in the NFL, Smith was known as a high energy player who would sacrifice his body on blocking and special teams alike. With both the Broncos and Indianapolis Colts, Smith instantly became a fan favorite with his big hits on special teams and willingness to do the little things. In total, he played in 113 games over 8 seasons, highlighted by his selection to the Pro Bowl 1999 and two Super Bowl rings won with the Broncos (Super Bowl XXXII in 1997 and Super Bowl XXXIII in 1998).

Career Banks's musical career dates back to 1963, when he built his first guitar. He formed his first band in 1967, taking inspiration from the UK top 40 hits that a local radio station transmitted from a frigate moored off the coast of the island.Thompson, Dave (2002) \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, Bankie's first number one hit in 1977 was \\"Prince of Darkeness\\" and followed that with several chart topping songs over the next few years. With the release of his first album Roots and Herbs in 1978, recorded with his band, The Roots and Herbs, Banks pioneered reggae music in the Eastern Caribbean. Following the releases of the album, Where I and I Abide, Bankie became the first performer from Anguilla to appear at Reggae Sunsplash, in 1983 and he appeared again in 1992. He was featured during a live Sunsplash performance in the ground-breaking reggae documentary Cool Runnings. Following his success has Reggae Sunsplash 1983, Bankie and his band The Roots & Herbs toured extensively in the Caribbean before heading to Europe. Discord prior to the Europe trip caused the band to change form, and several founding members left the band including Ras B, Iwandai I and Irino. The band spent three years in Europe and garnered a strong fan-base while there. Bankie Banx and the Roots and Herbs disbanded in 1987 and many of the members returned to the Caribbean. Bankie returned to be with his family after the death of his younger sister. Bankie spent the late 1980s in New York City and worked with musicians including Junior Jazz, Robert Manos, Robert Mansfield. Bankie Banx and The New York Connection were regulars on the East Coast music scene and had strong followings in Boston, New York and New Hampshire. Bankie continued to return to Anguilla for annual performances and started the Moonsplash Music Festival in 1991, staged in the grounds of his own bar, The Dune Preserve. Moonsplash has become one of the premier music festivals in the Eastern Caribbean and has featured internationally revered artists. Artists who have appeared at the Dune Preserve include David Bryan of Bon Jovi, Jimmy Buffett, Rita Marley, Richie Havens, The Bacon Brothers, Black Uhuru, Freddie McGregor, Peter Cetera, Third World, Culture, Steel Pulse, David Hinds, Tarrus Riley, Duane Stephenson, Marcia Griffiths, Derrick Morgan, Roots & Herbs, Buju Banton, Gramps Morgan, Anthony B, Burning Spear, The Wailers Band, Inner Circle (reggae band), Toots & the Maytals, Benjy Myaz, Alana Davis, Junior Jazz, Orange Grove, Corey Stoot, Onaje Allan Gumbs and John Mayer. The bar was destroyed by Hurricane Lenny in 1999, but Banks rebuilt it and Moonsplash went ahead again in 2000. Bankie has made several international television appearances, including a recurring role on the Fox sitcom Key West and a February 2011 guest concert appearance on The Bachelor, and has been featured on the soundtrack for the award-winning independent film Southie. Bankie's sound has been described as a cross between Bob Marley and Bob Dylan, and his music a blend of folk, reggae, R&B; and jazz. He is often called the \\"Anguillan Bob Dylan\\", and indeed has played with Dylan himself. In Summer 2005, Bankie started the Project Stingray music and arts education program on Anguilla. Bankie's fall tour of the United States supported awareness and raised funds for the Stingray Program. Through his fund-raising efforts Bankie was able to donate 30 brand new guitars to the Stingray Program during the Cultural and Arts Fair at Moonsplash 2006. During a Jimmy Buffett charity event hosted by Bankie Banx at The Dune Preserve, Bankie raised over one hundred thousand for local charities. In 2006, Bankie released his music video promo for \\"Big Chief\\", taken from his 2003 album, Chariots of Steel. The video told the story of a young island boy discovering his roots and was shot on location in Anguilla. Scenes were also shot in neighbouring St. Martin. The video was made by Driftwood Pictures, and was produced by Yoni Gal, directed by Trishul Thejasvi and Production Managed by Karsten Hansen. Bankie's next studio album, The News, was released on 15 September 2009. The first single from the album, \\"King of the Dune\\", was released 18 August 2009 on iTunes. On 17 January 2012, Bankie released his latest studio album, entitled Just Cool. It has also been said by writers such as Lasana M. Sekou that while Bankie is widely known for his music and unique singing voice and generally not thought of as a writer of verse, Bankie is undoubtedly one of Anguilla's \\"accomplished poets.\\" The poetry of Bankie Banx can be found in the new anthology Where I See The Sun – Contemporary Poetry in Anguilla (2015).

He is the father of surgeon James Hinton and grandfather of mathematician and science fiction author Charles Howard Hinton. Life John Howard Hinton was born in Oxford in 1791 to James Hinton (1761–1823) and Ann Hinton. His Father, James Hinton, was a pastor in Oxford, and ran a school. Hinton was taught at his father's school where he became friends with Edward Steane.Rosemary Chadwick, ‘Steane, Edward (1798–1882)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 July 2014 Hinton first preached in Reading, afterwards became pastor of a Baptist church in London, and was distinguished as an independent and original preacher, and a zealous advocate for liberty in religion and politics, for example arguing that it was the church's responsibility to punish \\"violations of morality\\", such as lying, whereas the state should limit itself to enforcing \\"offences against society\\" (which might encompass the former, such as theft). For many yeats Hinton was a joint secretary of the Baptist Union with his lifelong friend Edward Steane.

There are two slightly different versions of the Langlands classification. One of these describes the irreducible admissible (g,K)-modules, for g a Lie algebra of a reductive Lie group G, with maximal compact subgroup K, in terms of tempered representations of smaller groups. The tempered representations were in turn classified by Anthony Knapp and Gregg Zuckerman. The other version of the Langlands classification divides the irreducible representations into L-packets, and classifies the L-packets in terms of certain homomorphisms of the Weil group of R or C into the Langlands dual group. Notation *g is the Lie algebra of a real reductive Lie group G in the Harish-Chandra class. *K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, with Lie algebra k. *ω is a Cartan involution of G, fixing K. *p is the −1 eigenspace of a Cartan involution of g. *a is a maximal abelian subspace of p. *Σ is the root system of a in g. *Δ is a set of simple roots of Σ. Classification The Langlands classification states that the irreducible admissible representations of (g,K) are parameterized by triples :(F, σ,λ) where *F is a subset of Δ *Q is the standard parabolic subgroup of F, with Langlands decomposition Q = MAN *σ is an irreducible tempered representation of the semisimple Lie group M (up to isomorphism) *λ is an element of Hom(aF,C) with α(Re(λ))>0 for all simple roots α not in F. More precisely, the irreducible admissible representation given by the data above is the irreducible quotient of a parabolically induced representation. For an example of the Langlands classification, see the representation theory of SL2(R). Variations There are several minor variations of the Langlands classification. For example: *Instead of taking an irreducible quotient, one can take an irreducible submodule. *Since tempered representations are in turn given as certain representations induced from discrete series or limit of discrete series representations, one can do both inductions at once and get a Langlands classification parameterized by discrete series or limit of discrete series representations instead of tempered representations. The problem with doing this is that it is tricky to decide when two irreducible representations are the same. References * *E.

It pioneered the independent music industry in the 1990s, being the most successful of its time, and inspiring the creation of many other indie labels. The company is now a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Thailand. History Bakery Music was founded as an independent music label in 1994 by Somkiat Ariyachaipanich (aka. Zomkiat, Mr. Z), Kamol Sukosol Clapp (aka. Sukie), Boyd Kosiyabong and Salinee Panyarachun. The four had collaborated on Zomkiat's Z-Myx album in early 1994, and by mid-year founded Bakery Music as a record label. The first release by the company by alternative rock band Moderndog featuring an album of the same name became an instant hit, \\"storming the charts\\" and selling 500,000 copies.Lersakvanitchakul, \\"Ten Hot Years\\". For the next few years, Bakery released multiple successful acts, which include Boyd himself, Joey Boy, Yokee Playboy, Thee Chaiyadej and Pause among others. It received acclaimed for its indie productions, and increased in size to include a staff of one hundred people (compared to the original seven). It also published a monthly magazine, Katch. The label however suffered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, reporting losses from 1997 onwards, and in 2000 BMG acquired a fifty-one percent majority in the company's shares. Katch was discontinued and the staff was reduced to twenty. In 2002, following restructuring during the previous year in which BMG assumed most financial management, Bakery returned to profitability, while claiming a five percent share of the national music industry. It released twenty-five albums throughout the year, and began VCD and karaoke production.Suwanprakorn, \\"Music Company Partnership Has Profitable Year in Thailand\\".

It is a charter member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), whose first drawing was held in 1988. History The Lottery began selling tickets January 20, 1986. An executive director oversees the organization and reports to a five-member commission that is appointed by the governor. May Scheve Reardon took over as Missouri Lottery executive director in December, 2009. In the beginning, Lottery proceeds were directed to Missouri's General Revenue fund. In 1992, voters approved Amendment 11, which earmarked proceeds for public education. All monies since July 1993 have gone to education programs. Proceeds are appropriated by the Legislature. The Lottery offers Scratchers tickets, plus the online games Missouri Lotto, Club Keno, Pick 3, Pick 4, Show Me Cash, and Powerball. Powerball's former rival, Mega Millions, came to Missouri on January 31, 2010. The $250,000 Scratcher card generated much publicity when unemployed couple Robert Russell and Tracie Rogers won the jackpot in July 2010. The Lottery's mission: \\"The Missouri Lottery generates funds to provide educational opportunities for Missouri students, support Missouri businesses and entertain millions.\\" The minimum age to purchase a Missouri Lottery ticket is 18. Lottery games Current in-house games =Club Keno/Keno To Go= Club Keno has drawings every four minutes. Traditionally sold in age- controlled environments (often where alcoholic beverages are served), the game is now available at any Missouri Lottery retailer as Keno To Go. Options and prizes vary. =Scratchers= Scratch cards are the Lottery's most popular games, sold in a large variety of locations from gas stations to sports venues via vending machines. Card prices range from $1 to $30, with the more expensive games having better odds of winning as well as larger prizes. Themed scratchers are common (such as for holidays, promotional tie-ins with St. Louis and Kansas City sports teams, or licensed pop-culture properties) and players are occasionally encouraged to enter specific losing tickets into \\"second chance\\" drawings for additional prizes. =Pick 3= Pick 3 is drawn twice daily, seven days a week. Prices, options, and prizes vary. =Pick 4= Pick 4 is almost identical to Pick 3, except that a four-digit number is drawn. =Show Me Cash= Show Me Cash is played daily, drawing five numbers from 1 through 39. Games cost $1 each. Jackpots begin at $50,000, increasing by at least $5,000 until there is a game matching all five numbers. =Missouri Lotto= Missouri Lotto is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Six numbers from 1 through 44 are chosen. Players get two games for each $1 wager (games must be played in multiples of two.) The progressive jackpot begins at $1,000,000 (annuitized with a cash option); players win cash by matching at least four of the six numbers in any game. A free $1 play is won by matching three numbers. The game's monetary prizes are paid on a pari-mutuel basis. Beginning November 4, 2012, randomly selected Missouri Lotto tickets are printed with the word \\"Doubler\\". Any money prize (except a jackpot, or jackpot share) won on a Doubler ticket wins twice the normal amount; a three-number match wins a $2 free play (four games.) Multi-jurisdictional games =Lucky for Life= In 2009, Connecticut launched a game called Lucky-4-Life. Three years later it became a regional game, taking on the current name. The current format began in January 2015. As of April 2017, Lucky for Life is available in 22 states and the District of Columbia Games are $2 each. =Mega Millions= On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium (then with 12 lotteries) and MUSL (with 33) reached an agreement to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball. Missouri joined Mega Millions on January 31, 2010, the cross-sell expansion date. Mega Millions is drawn Tuesdays and Fridays. Players choose five white balls numbered 1 through 75, and a gold-colored \\"Mega Ball\\" numbered 1 through 15. Games are $1 each, or $2 if the Megaplier is chosen. Jackpots begin at $15 million, payable in 30 graduated yearly installments unless the cash option is chosen. =Powerball= Powerball began in 1992. Its jackpots begin $40 million, with drawings on Wednesday and Saturday nights.

Located between Imperial Beach and Silver Strand State Beach near San Diego in southern California, USA, this facility was known by locals as the \\"elephant cage\\" which is a nickname for the large Wullenweber direction finder antenna. The antenna was used to provide direction finding, primary communication links for U.S. Navy submarines. The antenna was finally dismantled in 2015, even though it was scheduled to be removed in fiscal year 2007. Presently the area is part of Naval Base Coronado and commanded by that base's Commanding Officer. While just north of Imperial Beach, it is within the city limits of Coronado. History Naval Navy Radio Compass Station, circa 1925 Initially created in 1920 as the Navy Radio Compass Station, it was renamed in 1940 as the Navy Direction Finder Station when a permanent direction finding station was established. In 1943, thirty WAVES were stationed there, culminating in 1945 with a total of 112 WAVES; there they engaged in SIGINT. By 1953, it was known as Naval Radio Receiving Station Imperial Beach, and in 1965 it received its well-known Wullenweber Circular Disposed Antenna Array, an AN/FRD-10. The last of its type to be built, it ceased operation in 1999. Army In 1942, the United States Army took ownership of 412.14 acres in Coronado Heights and designated it Fort Emory in honor of Brigadier-General William H. Emory, itself being subordinate to Fort Rosecrans, being manned by the 19th Coast Artillery. Armament of the base consisted of four 155mm guns of Battery Imperial, which were later superseded by the two 6-inch M1905 guns of Battery Grant. Coastal radars were authorized in 1943. Construction of a two-gun 16-inch battery (#134) was completed in 1944; however, the guns were never mounted; these guns would have supplemented the 16-inch Battery Ashburn at Fort Rosecrans. In World War II, Fort Emory was garrisoned by the 19th Coast Artillery Regiment, and after October 1944 by the 523rd Coast Artillery Battalion.Gaines, William C., Coast Artillery Organizational History, 1917-1950, Coast Defense Journal, vol. 23, issue 2, p. 13 The land upon which the fort was located was turned over to the Navy in 1947, with a single army family as caretaker of the facilities, which were declared surplus a year later; in 1950 it was finally transferred to the Navy, integrating with the Imperial Beach Radio Station. Operations Today the facility provides an excellent training environment with waterborne approaches from both the Pacific Ocean and San Diego Bay sides. Offshore the Coronado Roads area is used for ship systems testing. The city-like layout of the base also provides a realistic site for critical urban warfare training. For amphibious operations training the beaches of the base have been designated Beach White, and Beach Purple, each with two training lanes. In 2010, the Navy proposed increased training, including mine-sweeping training, amphibious operations, as well as special warfare operations. This faced opposition during public hearings by environmentalist, due to possible impact upon the California Least Tern, San Diego fairy shrimp, and to a lesser extent the Western snowy plover. Later that year new warning signs were put up by the Navy warning of increased training, and of endangered species. A ten-year- long, 818-page environmental impact statement was released relating to this proposed increased activity, it was created with the assistance of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Sailors and Marines, training on the Complex are provided maps to avoid environmentally sensitive areas, and conduct clean- ups to minimize impact on those areas supervised by local organizations and the EPA. In an unrelated proposal, the base's water area will be used for training by the Littoral Combat Ships for antisubmarine warfare; the Navy has filed its impact upon wildlife with NOAA as it relates to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In September 2014, the Navy proposed demolishing the Wullenweber Antenna Array stating it was obsolete equipment; the San Diego array as of September 2014 is the last of its kind still standing. By early 2015, the array had been demolished. Construction of the coastal campus of Special Warfare Command seen from the San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge, in October 2017. In 2014, the Navy proposed expansion of Special Warfare Command facilities at Silver Strand, dubbed \\"Naval Base Coronado Coastal Campus\\"; the proposal had four alternatives, one which would demolish a historic bunker. Concern has been raised of planned expansion on the Lotus nuttallianus. At its outset, the expansion in facilities aboard Silver Strand was over $700 million. As of February 2016, the Navy plans to tear down the bunker; it had been planned to be named for Brigadier General George Washington Gatchell, but is identified as #134. It had been previously used by the Navy as an instruction of SEALs, and had the designation of \\"Building 99\\"; it would have been eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In August 2016, members of the Kumeyaay nation protested the construction due to concerns about disturbing buried ancestors. It was estimated that demolition of \\"Building 99\\" would be completed by December 2016. In April 2018, Representative Susan Davis raised concern of sewage spillage from the Tijuana River would have on SEAL training at the complex. In May 2018, construction continued with five new buildings of the 44 planned to be built, were completed with some already in use. Upon completion, it is expected that over 3,000 navy personnel will be working aboard the complex. In 2015, the Naval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command opened a course on unmanned aerial system, including the Scan Eagle, aboard Silver Strand Training Complex, with additional field activities occurring at Camp Roberts.

Commander of the Ordensburg was, from 1936 to 1941, Robert Bauer, an Old Fighter of the Nazi party and member of the Reichstag since 1933. After the war French troops first took over the Castle. Later the US Army located the training center for the US-Constabulary force there. From May 1951 through February 1952, was used by the United States Air Force in Europe as a basic training center,Ralph A. Lurvey (MSGT, USAF (Ret)), \\"Air Force Basic Training in Europe 1951-1953\\", March 2013. In 1956 the Castle was acquired by the Bundeswehr and was named after the member of resistance and former chief of the general staff of the army Colonel General Ludwig Beck.  Current use  The Generaloberst-Beck-Kaserne hosted schools of the Bundeswehr (Military Police (Feldjäger) and Staff Service). In 2009 the Bundeswehr transferred these schools to the Emmich-Cambrai-Kaserne in Hannover. Two other bases were then closed and their personnel moved to Sonthofen. Today the facility is protected as a historic site. References  Literature  * Hartmut Happel: Die Allgäuer Ordensburg in Sonthofen.

Except for Powerball, whose winning numbers are drawn with numbered balls in Tallahassee, Florida (and Mega Millions in Atlanta, Georgia), Nebraska Lottery games are drawn by a random number generator (RNG). (Mega Millions uses an RNG to determine its Megaplier.) The keno games available in Nebraska are municipal lotteries; these predate the Nebraska Lottery. Draw games Multi-jurisdictional games =2by2= 2by2, also played in Kansas and North Dakota, is drawn nightly. Two red numbers and two white numbers (each 1 through 26) are drawn. Games are $1; there are seven ways to win. Matching all four numbers wins $22,000; it is doubled if won on a Tuesday, and the ticket was bought for seven consecutive draws. =Mega Millions= In 1996, six lotteries began The Big Game; it became Mega Millions in 2002.

Fred Weiszmann was the league founder and first president in 1946 while Leslie O'Connor was the president in 1947 (as elected in December 1946). Financial problems reduced the league to five teams in September 1947. The Maroons and Vikings of Chicago were replaced with the Chicago Tornadoes. The remaining teams were the St. Louis Raiders, Pittsburgh Indians, Toronto Greenbacks, and Detroit Pioneers. The Tornadoes were a combination of the best players from the old Vikings and Maroons. 1946 season The 1946 season featured a 20-match schedule from 7 June to 1 September, with all five teams playing eight matches each. The Detroit Wolverines clinched the title on 24 August after rivals Toronto lost their second-last match of the season. Toronto won their last game of the season over Detroit on 25 August, but still finished one point back in the standings. Detroit and Toronto were then scheduled to meet in a two-match playoff, with Toronto winning the first match on 21 September. Detroit claimed that they did not want to complete the series as they had already won the league's championship. 1947 season The 1947 season featured a 30-match schedule from 6 April to 30 August, with all six teams scheduled to play 10 matches each. The champion Detroit Wolverines had dropped out of the league, while both the Detroit Pioneers and St. Louis Raiders were added to the league. The Pittsburgh Indians and Toronto Greenbacks finished tied for first place with 14 points each, thus requiring a two-match playoff to decide a champion. The two matches were played in October (after the Fall Season had started), with Pittsburgh winning both matches to claim the championship. 1947 Fall season After league meetings in July, the 1947 Fall season was scheduled to feature seven teams with the return of the Detroit Wolverines. The league decided against adding a team from Cleveland. By the time the season started in September, however, the revised schedule featured just four teams (without the Wolverines, Chicago Maroons, and Chicago Vikings). A fifth team, the new Chicago Tornadoes, was set to replace the two Chicago teams. Despite all the schedule revisions, only three teams were in action from 6 September to 4 October: Pittsburgh Indians, St. Louis Raiders, and Toronto Greenbacks.

He played eight seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a pitcher, for six different clubs. In his eight seasons in the major leagues, Smith appeared as a pitcher in 140 games and compiled a 54–74 (.422) win-loss record with a 3.89 earned run average (ERA) and 519 strikeouts. He saw his most extensive playing time with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, compiling a 41–50 win-loss record during the 1887 and 1888 seasons. Smith later served as a player-manager in the minor leagues from the early 1890s through 1905. He was credited with discovering Christy Mathewson in 1899 and developing him into an outstanding pitcher during the 1900 season. Early years Smith was born in Manayunk, now a neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia, in 1864. Professional baseball player 1883 to 1886 seasons Smith began his professional baseball career at age 18 playing for the Baltimore club in the National Association in 1883. In 1884, he played one game as pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics and another for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. He compiled an 0–2 win-loss record and a 6.35 earned run average (ERA) in his first season in the major leagues. Smith spent most of the 1885 and 1886 seasons playing with the Newark Little Giants of the Eastern League. He appeared in 20 games as a pitcher for Newark in 1885 and struck out 214 batters. As of 1921, the only pitchers to have attained an average of 10 strikeouts per game were Smith (1885), Baseball Hall of Fame inductee John Clarkson (418 strikeouts in 41 games in his first minor league season) and Eddie Knuff (390 strikeouts in 39 games for Memphis, 1886). He reportedly received the nickname \\"Phenomenal\\" after pitching a no-hitter against Baltimore on October 3, 1885. Only two batters reached base, one on an error and one on a base on balls, and Smith picked off both runners at first base. In 1886, Smith appeared in 33 games as a pitcher for Newark. He threw 33 complete games and compiled a 22–10 record with a 0.74 ERA. Smith also played briefly during the 1885 and 1886 seasons for the Brooklyn Grays (one game, 1885), Philadelphia Athletics (one game, 1885), and Detroit Wolverines (three games, 1886). In his five major league games during the 1885 and 1886 seasons, Smith compiled a 1–3 record with a 5.11 ERA. In his first and only game for Brooklyn, on June 17, 1885, Smith's teammates were reported to have intentionally committed 14 errors to punish Smith for his perceived brash and cocky demeanor. Brooklyn lost the game, 18–5. All 18 were initially scored as unearned‚ but record books indicate that 11 of the runs were earned. He reportedly claimed that he was so good that he did not need his teammates to win. The intentional misplays of his teammates caused club President Lynch to fine the guilty players $500 each‚ but he instead released Smith \\"to ensure team harmony.\\" Baltimore Smith saw his most extensive playing time in the major leagues with the Baltimore Orioles during the 1887 and 1888 seasons. In 1887, Smith appeared in 58 games as a pitcher for Baltimore, including 55 as a starter. He threw 54 complete games and pitched 491 innings, compiling a record of 25–30 with a 3.79 ERA and 206 strikeouts. The next year, he appeared in 35 games as a pitcher, 32 as a starter, pitched 31 complete games and 314 innings for the Orioles. He compiled a record of 14–19 with a 3.61 ERA. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Smith, c. 1888, with Philadelphia In early October 1888, the Philadelphia Athletics purchased Smith from the Baltimore Orioles for $1000 or $1500. He pitched three games for the Athletics at the end of the 1888 season, compiling a 2–1 record and a 2.86 ERA. In the first half of the 1889 season, he went 2–3 with a 4.40 ERA for the Athletics. In early June 1889, Smith was released by the Athletics. He finished the 1889 season playing for Hartford in the Atlantic Association. Smith played in the National League in 1890 for the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Alleghenys. He compiled a 9–15 record and a 4.06 ERA in 29 games as pitcher. At the start of the 1891 season, Smith was released by Pittsburgh and re- signed by the Phillies. Smith appeared in three games as pitcher for the 1891 Phillies and compiled a 1–1 record with a 4.26 ERA. He appeared in his last major league game on June 15, 1891, at age 26. Minor leagues Although his major league career ended in July 1891, Smith continued to play and manage in the minor leagues for another 15 years. His minor league career included stints with at least 12 different clubs, including the Milwaukee Brewers (1891), Green Bay Bays (1892), Reading Actives (1893), Pottsville Colts (1894–1895), Millville (1895), Pawtucket Phenoms (1896–1897), Fall River Indians (1898), Newark Colts (1898), Hartford Cooperatives (1898), Portland Phenoms (1899), and Norfolk Phenoms (1900). Smith was a player-manager for most of his minor league career, and he led Pottsville to the Pennsylvania League pennant in 1894 and Norfolk to a Virginia League pennant in 1900. While working as a minor league player-manager, Smith has been credited with discovering Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Christy Mathewson. Smith met and played against Matthewson in 1899 while Matthewson was still attending Bucknell and pitching for the Taunton Herrings. The 19-year-old Mathewson compiled a 2–13 record for Taunton in 1899, but Smith saw potential. Smith signed Matthewson to play for his Norfolk team for $90 a month, and under Smith's guidance, Matthewson compiled a 21–2 record and 0.74 ERA in 1900 and was promoted to the major leagues before the end of the season. Smith spent the last five years of his baseball career as a player-manager for the Manchester, New Hampshire baseball club from 1901 to 1905. At age 36, he won the 1901 New England League batting title with a .363 batting average in 284 at bats. Smith remained in Manchester for the rest of his life. Family and later years John Smith was married twice. The first time he married Margaret Cowan in 1884. They had two daughters, Isabel Smith Warnick, and Elsie Smith MacFarland. Margaret Cowan was from Scotland but her parents were born in Ireland.1900 US Census entry for Margaret Cowan Smith, wife of John Smith, and daughters Isabel and Elsie.

Composition The work was probably carried out beginning in the early 860s and completed around 866–67. This is based on a dedication in the book identifying as frater (brother) Wulfad, who was made a bishop in 866, making it unlikely that Eriugena would have used so casual a reference after that elevation. The work was not widely circulated in the author's lifetime. Eriugena was assisted by one, possibly two other persons in writing the book, based on the presence of margin notes indicating the penmanship of two separate persons. One of these is believed to have been Eriugena himself, while the script indicates that the second writer was a fellow Irishman. Four species of \\"Nature\\" The work is arranged in five books. The original plan was to devote one book to each of the four divisions, but the topic of creation required expansion. The form of exposition is that of dialogue; the method of reasoning is the syllogism. Natura is the name for the universal, the totality of all things, containing in itself being and non-being. It is the unity of which all special phenomena are manifestations. > Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which the infinite, > transcendent and 'unknown' God, who is beyond being and non-being, through a > process of self-articulation, procession, or 'self-creation', proceeds from > his divine 'darkness' or 'non-being' into the light of being, speaking the > Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same timeless moment bringing > forth the Primary Causes of all creation... He treats of the essentially > dialectical relation between Creator and created, where God expresses > Himself in creation and creation culminates in return to the divine.Moran, > Dermot, \\"John Scottus Eriugena\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy > (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) Of this nature there are four distinct species: #That which creates and is not created -this is God, the Source and Principle of all things; #That which is created and creates -this is the world of primordial causes or (Platonic) ideas; #That which is created and does not create— this is the world of phenomena, the world of contingent, sense-perceived things; #That which neither is created nor creates — this is God, the Term to which all things are returning. The first is God as the ground or origin of all things. The \\"creation\\" of the world is in reality a theophania, or showing forth of the Essence of God in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the soul in higher intellectual and spiritual truth, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature. Nature in the second sense, is the world of primordial causes, or ideas, which the Father \\"created\\" in the Son, and which in turn \\"create\\", that is determine the generic and specific natures of concrete visible things. Since they are, though created, identical with God, and since their locus is the Word of God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, they are operative causes and not merely static types. From this, however, it is not necessary to infer, as some critics have done, that according to Eriugena the primordial causes are identical with the Word. As examples of primordial causes Eriugena enumerates goodness, wisdom, intuition (insight), understanding, virtue, greatness, power, etc. Turner, William. \\"John Scotus Eriugena.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 June 2019 The third sense, \\"which is created and does not create\\", is where the stream of reality, setting out from the centre, God, passing through the ideas in the Word, and enters the realm of space and time. Here they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter and become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter — here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. The last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The return to God proceeds in the inverse order through all the steps which marked the downward course, or process of things from God. The elements become light, light becomes life, life becomes sense, sense becomes reason, reason becomes intellect, intellect becomes ideas in Christ, the Word of God, and through Christ returns to the oneness of God from which all the processes of nature began. This \\"incorporation\\" in Christ takes place by means of Divine grace in the Church, of which Christ is the invisible head. Thus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end; but these three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. Commentary French journalist and author Jean-Jacques Gabut, says \\"Moreover, a certain pantheism, or rather pandeism, emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy.\\"Gabut, Jean-Jacques. Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la maçonnerie écossaise, 2017 According to William Turner, professor of Philosophy at Catholic University of America, the doctrine of the final return of all things to God shows very clearly the influence of Origen. In general, the system of thought outlined is a combination of neo-Platonic mysticism, emanationism, and pantheism which Eriugena strove in vain to reconcile with Aristotelean empiricism, Christian creationism, and theism. \\"The result is a body of doctrines loosely articulated, in which the mystic and idealistic elements predominate, and in which there is much that is irreconcilable with Catholic dogma.\\" Eriugena himself denied explicitly that he was a pantheist. \\"God is all in all. All things that are in God, even are God, are eternal...the creature subsists in God, and God is created in the creature in a wonderful and ineffable way, making himself manifest, invisible making himself visible...But the divine nature, he finally insists, because it is above being, is different from what it create within itself.\\"O'Meara, John J., \\"Introduction\\", The Mind of Eriugena, (John J. O'Meara and Ludwig Bieler, eds.), Dublin: Irish University Press 1973. Although Eriugena asserts the identity of God and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the 'genus' or 'whole' (totum) of which the creatures are 'species' or 'parts'. Only metaphorically can it be said that God is a 'genus' or a 'whole'. Assertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always balanced in Eriugena's writings by assertions of God's transcendence above all things.\\" De divisione naturae was condemned by a council at Sens by Honorius III (1225), for promoting the identity of God and creation, and by Pope Gregory XIII in 1585. In 1681, the long-lost work was found at Oxford University, and was immediately placed on the 'Index of Forbidden Books', a turn of events which likely actually spurred its popularity. Despite this result, Turner noted of Eriugena that \\"there can be no doubt that he himself abhorred heresy, was disposed to treat the heretic with no small degree of harshness..., and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the Church.\\" Legacy The Division of Nature has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which \\"synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries and appears as the final achievement of ancient philosophy.\\"Burch, George. Early Medieval Philosophy, Kings Crown Press. 1951 It is presented, like Alcuin's book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates Thomas Aquinas, who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time.

Ross was one of eight Senators appointed directly by the Queen on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney under Section 26 of the Constitution Act, 1867 in order to pass the Goods and Services Tax. The measure had faced defeat in the Liberal dominated Senate so Mulroney utilized a previously unused constitutional provision in order to allow him to temporarily expand the size of the upper house by a total of eight Senators (two per region) in order to ensure he had enough votes to enact the GST into law. A businessman by trade, Ross resigned from the Senate in May 1993, after only 972 days, in order to return to public life. At the age of 55, he was entitled to have remained in the Senate for a further 20 years before being forced to retire. Ross remains active in Fredericton, New Brunswick as a philanthropist and businessman. In 1994, he founded Partners For Youth Inc., a non-profit organization built on a community partnership model that uses adventure-based counseling to help young people.

Its games consist of scratch tickets; Pick 3, Pick 4, Pick 5 (\\"numbers games\\"); Keno, Lucky for Life, Mega Millions, Classic Lotto, and Powerball. The Lottery's slogan is \\"Take a chance on education. Odds are, you'll have fun!\\" The Lottery's current executive director is Pat McDonald; previous directors include Mike Dolan, Tom Hayes, and Dennis Berg. As with most U.S. lotteries, Ohio Lottery players must be 18 or older. History In 1971, State Senator Ron Mottl began a campaign to begin a lottery in Ohio. In 1973, the creation of the Ohio Lottery Commission was approved by voters; the Lottery began in August 1974 with the game Buckeye 300. Its first online game, The Number (now \\"Pick 3\\"), began in 1979. In July 1983, the Ohio General Assembly began earmarking Lottery profits for education. It was made permanent in 1987 when voters approve a constitutional amendment to make Lottery profits a supplement revenue stream for education. Governance The Ohio Lottery is run by the Ohio Lottery Commission. The Ohio Lottery Commission is made up of a Director and nine members appointed by the Governor of Ohio. The Director of the Lottery reports directly to the Governor. Current draw games In-house draw games =Pick 3= On December 3, 1979, The Number became the first Ohio online game where players could choose their number(s). On August 16, 1999, Pick 3 expanded to twice-daily draws. Sunday drawings were added on May 20, 2007. =Pick 4= On April 9, 1981, Pick 4 was added; it began as a once-a-week game, gradually expanding to twice-daily and Sunday draws as well. =Pick 5= On August 12, 2012, Pick 5 was added; it is played twice daily in conjunction with the other \\"numbers\\" games. The game is played much like Pennsylvania's game of the same name in that Pick 5 has straight and box wagers. =Rolling Cash 5= On October 4, 2004, Rolling Cash 5 replaced Buckeye 5. The 5-of-5 prize in Buckeye 5 was changed to a jackpot that begins at $100,000. Since May 20, 2007, Rolling Cash 5 has been drawn nightly. The game draws from a 39-ball pool. =Classic Lotto= On January 22, 2007, Classic Lotto 6/49 began; it replaced Lot 'O Play, a bingo-style game. Classic Lotto is drawn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Jackpots begin at $1 million; games cost $1 each. Unlike Mega Millions and Powerball (see below), each using a \\"floating percentage\\" of their annuity for the two games' cash options, the Ohio-only game fixes the cash-value ratio of the annuity at 50%. On April 29, 2012, The Kicker, once retired, became an option for Classic Lotto players (see below.)http://www.ohiolottery.com/assets/pdf/about/jan_12_minutes =The Kicker (add-on to Classic Lotto)= In April 1988, The Kicker add-on game began, as an option for Super Lotto. A six-digit number was added to all Super Lotto tickets, whether or not The Kicker was \\"activated.\\" When Super Lotto became Super Lotto Plus in July 2000, The Kicker was added to SLP. When SLP ended in October 2005, The Kicker became an add-on for Mega Millions, but only within Ohio. This \\"relationship\\" lasted until mid-January 2011, when Ohio ended the add-on in favor of making the Megaplier available to Mega Millions players within Ohio (the Megaplier technically not an add-on, as it is not a \\"separate game\\"); the Megaplier began as a Texas-only option. In April 2012, The Kicker was revived and became an add-on for Classic Lotto. A Classic Lotto play with The Kicker costs $1. An exact match in The Kicker wins $100,000; other prizes are available. =Keno= Keno is played at Ohio Lottery retailers that have a monitor. Keno was initially limited to retailers which have a liquor license allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises, thus making it available mostly in restaurants and bars. Keno to Go was added on April 9, 2012, which allows players to buy tickets at any Ohio Lottery retailer. Drawings are four minutes apart. Minimum play is $1. Multi-jurisdictional games =Lucky for Life= In 2009, the Connecticut Lottery began Lucky4Life, a draw game which featured a \\"lifetime\\" top prize. Numerous changes include a new name Lucky for Life, an extra number to be matched, expansion to 16 states and the District of Columbia (as of November 15, 2015 with Ohio joining), two lifetime prize tiers, and a cash option in lieu of a lifetime prize. Games are $2 each. Top prize is $1,000-per-day for life; second prize is $1,000-per-week. =Mega Millions= On September 6, 1996, six lotteries began a jackpot game then known as The Big Game. On May 15, 2002, the multi-jurisdictional game, which temporarily became The Big Game Mega Millions, was added to the Ohio Lottery; Mega Millions' first drawing which included Ohio-bought tickets was two days later. The add-on game The Kicker (see above) was \\"transferred\\" from Super Lotto Plus to Mega Millions in 2005; Ohio ended The Kicker when the Megaplier (which began as a Texas-only option) was available to Ohio players of Mega Millions in 2011. Mega Millions' starting jackpot is $15 million, paid in 30 graduated installments; a cash option is available. =Powerball= Powerball began in 1992. On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in US lottery jurisdictions. Both games added members on January 31, 2010; although Ohio, already with Mega Millions, did not add Powerball until April 16, 2010. The first Powerball drawing including Ohio was the following night. A ticket bought in Ohio for the June 2, 2010, Powerball drawing became its first potential Powerball jackpot winner; it is the first time a lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball (but not both) on January 31, 2010 sold a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game after the cross-selling expansion date. The ticket is worth $261.6 million (annuity). Former games =Ohio Lotto= On April 9, 1983, Ohio Lotto 6/40 was added; it was drawn Saturdays. Jackpots began at $250,000. On November 19, 1983, the starting jackpot was increased to $1 million. On October 3, 1984, Wednesday drawings were added; after February 12, 1986, the game returned to Saturdays only. Its final drawing was on April 18, 1987. =Super Lotto= On February 19, 1986, Super Lotto 6/44 was added and was drawn Wednesdays; it replaced the 6/40 Wednesday drawings. On April 25, 1987, the 6/44 added Saturdays, replacing the 6/40 altogether. Players of the 6/44 paid $1 per game; its jackpots began at $5 million. The base jackpot was reduced to $3 million when twice-a-week draws resumed. On April 30, 1988, The Kicker (see above) began as an add-on, initially to the 6/44. On October 6, 1990, the 6/44 was changed to a 6/53 matrix (with two plays for $1), with the jackpot again starting at $5 million. Months later, the 6/53 was retired; in its place was the 6/47 (one play for $1), with the jackpots now starting at $4 million. The final 6/47 drawing was July 8, 2000. =Buckeye 5= On May 5, 1992, Buckeye 5 was added; it was originally drawn on Tuesday and Friday nights. Buckeye 5's top prize was $100,000. On July 1, 1993, Buckeye 5 was expanded to Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; on April 1, 2002, Buckeye 5 became a Monday-through-Saturday game. Buckeye 5's last drawing was on October 2, 2004; it was replaced with Rolling Cash 5. =Super Lotto Plus= On July 15, 2000, SLP was introduced, replacing the 6/47. SLP was a 6/49 game that also drew a \\"bonus ball.\\" The Kicker became an add-on to SLP. The jackpots again began at $4 million. SLP's last drawing was October 8, 2005, with The Kicker becoming Mega Millions' add-on game. =Lot 'O Play= On October 12, 2005, Lot 'O Play held its first drawing. It was a 5/100 bingo- style game with base jackpots of $1 million. Lot O'Play's last drawing was on January 20, 2007, after which it was replaced by Classic Lotto. =Ten- OH!= Ohio added a twice-daily game on August 5, 2007, called Ten-OH!, which was a Keno-like game; the first Ohio Lottery game in which the drawings were computerized. (As a result, the Ten-OH! drawings were not televised.) The top prize of $500,000 was won by matching 10 of the 20 numbers drawn. On August 11, 2012, 10-OH! had its final drawing. It was replaced by Pick 5 the following day. The popularity of Ten-OH! was hampered by the addition of Keno to bars and restaurants in 2008, which made the game somewhat redundant. The addition of Keno to Go in 2012 made it further redundant. Cash Explosion The Cash Explosion game show returned in October 2007, replacing Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich (which itself had replaced Cash Explosion Double Play a year earlier).

It was created on 25 June 1660 for John Shuckburgh, the eldest son of Sir Richard Shuckburgh, (1594–1656) Member of Parliament for Warwickshire and a supporter of the Royalist cause in the Civil War, who was knighted before the Battle of Edgehill by Charles I. His son was raised to the baronetcy on the Restoration of Charles II of England. His son, the second Baronet, was High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1687 and sat as Member of Parliament for Warwickshire 1698–1705. The fifth also served as High Sheriff in 1769. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baronet in 1773. He was a politician, mathematician and astronomer. He assumed the additional surname of Evelyn because his second wife Julia Annabella was a distant relative of the diarist John Evelyn, whose closer line of inheritance had died out. However, as he was succeeded by his younger brother, the surname Evelyn was not retained by any of his successors. The eleventh Baronet also served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1921. As of 2014 the title is held by the fourteenth Baronet, who succeeded his father in 2012. Basil Shuckburgh, younger son of the eleventh Baronet, a Lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, was killed in action in Crete in 1941. He served as a Major in the 11th City of London Yeomanry and was a Justice of the Peace for Warwickshire. The Shuckburgh family take their name from the Warwickshire village in which they settled in the 12th century.

Description The Rö runestone was discovered in 1919 at the farm Rö on the island of Otterö, north of the fishing village Grebbestad in Bohuslän. At that time, it was erected near the location where it was found, but currently resides in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. The stone is made of granite and it is 2 metres tall and more than 1.2 metres wide. The inscription was made on a flat surface, unfortunately damaged due to flaking, and runs in four parallel rows from top to bottom. Using the elder futhark, the runes are composed in Proto-Norse exhibiting preserved declensions and intermediate vowels that would ultimately be lost when the language transitioned into Old Norse. The form of the runes suggests that the inscription dates from the early 5th century and is consequently the longest inscription from a period earlier than the 7th century. Because the location where this runestone stood is adjacent to an ancient sailing route, it is possible that the inscription was made by visitors and not by locals. The name Stainawarijaz in the text means \\"Stone Guard\\" or \\"Keeper of Stones.\\" In addition, the word fahido, often translated as \\"carved\\" or \\"inscribed,\\" actually means \\"painted.\\" Many runestones had their inscriptions painted, although there is no direct evidence that the Rö runestone was painted other than the use of this word.

Born around 1490 in Glasgow, he was the son of Thomas Stewart of Minto. Details about his early life are obscure, but it is known that he attended the University of Glasgow before travelling to continental Europe to study theology and canon law.Macfarlane, \\"Stewart, William (c. 1490–1545)\\". The first benefice he held was the parsonage of Lochmaben, which he was in possession of by July 1528.Innes, p. lvi. In the same year he became rector of Ayr,Innes, p. lvi; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 365. while he had received crown presentation as Provost of Lincluden Collegiate Church in July 1529, a post he would hold along with his new position as Lord High Treasurer of Scotland.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 365. In 1530 he received a crown presentation to Pope Clement VII for the deanery of Glasgow, a position he held until on 22 March 1532, when he was nominated by King James V of Scotland to succeed Gavin Dunbar as Bishop of Aberdeen.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 4. Stewart was consecrated as Bishop of Aberdeen in either March or April 1533.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 4, 155. Stewart was an active and important servant of the Scottish king. He led the diplomatic expedition to England which, on 11 May 1534, agreed a peace treaty between James V and King Henry VIII of England. He was sent to France in 1536, where he helped draw up the contract for his king's marriage to Mary of Guise. He went on a further mission to England in December 1541. As Bishop of Aberdeen, he strongly resisted the emerging protestant heresies, attending condemnations in 1534 and 1540. Bishop Stewart laid down a new series of constitutions for his clergy, constitutions resembling and reinforcing similar such measures previously enacted by Bishop Elphinstone.Innes, Registrum, p. lvii; Macfarlane, \\"Stewart, William (c.1490–1545)\\". He completed building work on King's College, Aberdeen, including a new library and sacristy, as well as two new schools for his diocese.Innes, Registrum, p. lviii; Macfarlane, \\"Stewart, William (c.1490–1545)\\".

He served in the National Assembly of Quebec from 2003 to 2018, representing Orford as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party. Reid is a former cabinet minister in Jean Charest's government. He is not to be confused with a senior public servant in Quebec named Pierre Reid. Early life and academic career Reid was born in Jonquière, Quebec. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Université Laval (1970) and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Université de Paris XI (1974). After working as a computer consultant for IBM Canada, Reid became a professor of administrative data processing at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi in 1976. Two years later, he joined the business administration department at the Université de Sherbrooke. He became a vice-rector of the university in 1989, and four years later he defeated Marie Malavoy to become university rector.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"A minister weaned on politics\\", Montreal Gazette, 12 November 1994, B1. Reid supported the Université de Sherbrooke's links to Gaz Métropolitain, which provided a $105,000 scholarship for research in the natural gas sector.\\"Gaz Metropolitain, Inc. Contributes To The Fondation De L'Universite De Sherbrooke\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 24 October 1997, 12:15. He speculated about privatizing some academic programs in 1996, to find new revenue sources in light of government cutbacks.\\"Grad school privatized: McGill wants self-supporting post-grad programs\\", Canadian Press, 12 April 1996, B6. In 2001, he welcomed a $4.7 million investment from the government of Canada to fund health researchers on campus.\\"Sherbrooke's research capacity receives $4.7 million shot in the arm\\", Canada NewsWire, 13:58. Reid was appointed as an associate deputy minister at Industry Canada in 2001.Kathryn May, \\"Ottawa creates new top-level bureaucrats,\\" 20 August 2001, A04. Legislator Education minister Reid was a star candidate for the Liberal Party in the 2003 provincial election and was easily elected as the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for Orford. The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election under Jean Charest's leadership, and Charest appointed Reid as his education minister on April 29, 2003.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Charest sworn in as Quebec\\", Globe and Mail, 30 April 2003, A7. A Montreal Gazette report from this period indicated that Reid was well regarded for his skills as a manager and administrator.\\"Who's who in the cabinet\\", Montreal Gazette, 30 April 2003, A4. ;University funding Reid made significant changes to university student funding in 2004, shifting $103 million from bursaries to repayable loans.\\"Students decry loan decision\\", Montreal Gazette, 16 August 2004, A7; \\"Debt Crisis: Students Are Taking Action\\", Canada NewsWire, 23 September 2004, 18:06; Eilis Quinn, \\"2,000 demonstrate outside Quebec provincial Liberal meeting in Montreal\\", Canadian Press, 20 November 2004, 19:19; Kevin Dougherty, \\"Students to get bigger loans, easier terms\\", Montreal Gazette, 2 April 2004, A8. He also announced that student loans would become easier to obtain and that repayments would be proportional to income after graduation; in some cases, graduates would not be required to make payments during periods of unemployment.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Quebec ties loan repayment to students' future earnings\\", Globe and Mail, 2 April 2004, A7. Student leaders and the opposition Parti Québécois strongly criticized the shift from bursaries to loans, describing it as a betrayal of the province's lower-income students.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Quebec ties loan repayment to students' future earnings\\", Globe and Mail, 2 April 2004, A7. The Canadian Federation of Students also criticized Reid's repayment policy, with one student leader sarcastically describing it as \\"Study now, pay forever\\".Les Perreaux, \\"Quebec introduces student loan repayment system based on income\\", Canadian Press, 12 January 2005, 17:16. Reid argued in response that his changes would allow more students to register at universities.\\"Quebec students protest against funding changes\\", Globe and Mail, 11 November 2004, A11. There were several protests against Reid's funding reforms in 2004 and 2005, including one protest in February 2005 that turned violent.Eilis Quinn, \\"2,000 demonstrate outside Quebec provincial Liberal meeting in Montreal\\", Canadian Press, 20 November 2004, 19:19; Rhéal Séguin, \\"Violent protests mark Quebec caucus retreat\\", Globe and Mail, 17 February 2005, A7; Peggy Curran, \\"A year after Charest's bungle, who'll blink first?\\", Montreal Gazette, 30 March 2005, A6. Reid promised to re-invest \\"massive\\" funding into loans and bursaries after a revolt of the Liberal Party's youth wing in late 2004, but did not remain in the education portfolio long enough to carry this out.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Tuition hike could be coming, Charest warns\\", Globe and Mail (breaking news), 21 November 2004. Reid promised in November 2004 that he would maintain Quebec's long-standing university tuition freeze during the Charest government's first mandate, but would not make any commitments beyond that time.Ross Marowits, \\"Quebec should boost hydro capacity to enhance exports, says Charest\\", Canadian Press, 21 November 2004, 17:32. ;Jewish private schools funding In December 2004, Reid announced a new association between Quebec's public schools and Jewish private schools in a bid to improve cultural ties. This decision was made after the firebombing of one of Montreal's United Talmud Torah schools which resulted in the destruction of a library.Karen Seidman, \\"Joining forces to ward off hate\\", Montreal Gazette, 15 January 2005, A6. The following month, Quebec media sources discovered that the Charest government had agreed to pay full funding to Jewish private schools through the cultural association. This was a shift from a previous policy of funding about sixty per cent of the costs.\\"Quebec to boost funding for Jewish day schools, promote exchanges\\", Canadian Press, 13 January 2005, 23:45; Karen Seidman and Kevin Dougherty, \\"Funding for Jewish schools to be hiked: Subsidy boost to 100 % from 60 stirs controversy\\", Montreal Gazette, 14 January 2005, A1. The funding decision was made without cabinet approval or discussion; when it became public knowledge, Reid indicated that other private religious and cultural schools would also be eligible for such funding. Several public school officials, teachers groups, and parents groups criticized the decision on the grounds that it would undermine public education.Rhéal Séguin and Caroline Alphonso, \\"Quebec boosts Jewish schools\\", Globe and Mail, 15 January 2005, A12. The Charest government was ultimately forced to cancel its plans following an extremely negative public reaction. While still supporting the funding change in principle, Charest acknowledged that his government had handled the matter poorly.Some of the opposition was fueled by media reports that the decision to fund Jewish private schools came only days after Jewish groups raised $750,000 for the Quebec Liberal Party. Charest angrily rejected the suggestion that there was any link between the political contributions and the policy decision, and described some of the public opposition as rooted in prejudice. Pauline Marois, then the Parti Québécois's education critic, criticized the latter statement, saying that popular opposition was in fact rooted in concern for public education. Les Perreaux, \\"Quebec backtracks on full Jewish-school funding; Charest cites \`prejudice'\\", Canadian Press, 19 January 2005, 18:49; Peter Rakobowchuk, \\"Premier Jean Charest denies money for Jewish schools tied to fundraising\\", Canadian Press, 19 January 2005, 00:08; Rhéal Séguin, \\"Quebec abandons plan to fund religious schools\\", Globe and Mail, 20 January 2005, A10. One Montreal Gazette columnist argued that the Charest government mishandled the issue by not announcing its funding policy change from the beginning.Don Macpherson, \\"Charest's political stupidity is revealed for all to see\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 22 January 2005, A31. The controversy damaged Reid's public standing.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Cloud over Charest getting darker still\\", National Post, 19 February 2005, A9. ;High schools In May 2003, Reid announced that francophone schools would start English lessons in the first grade and devote more class time to English- language education. The previous Parti Québécois government had brought English lessons forward from the fourth to the third grade, but had reduced the overall time devoted to English.Allison Lampert, \\"English instruction to start in Grade 1, new education minister confirms\\", Canadian Press, 9 May 2003, 11:33. Reid announced in 2004 that persons with serious criminal records would not receive provincial teaching certificates.\\"Quebec introduces measures to exclude future teachers with criminal past\\", Canadian Press, 19 May 2004, 19:42. He dropped plans to introduce a professional teaching order after teachers voted in large numbers against the plan.Ann Carroll, \\"Quebec teachers decide against forming professional order\\", Montreal Gazette, 20 February 2004, A5; Allison Lampert, \\"Order for teachers abandoned: Educators hated idea proposed by Quebec\\", Montreal Gazette, 22 April 2005, A10. ;Federal initiatives In addition to serving as provincial education minister, Reid was also appointed to a two-year term as chair of the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada in October 2003.\\"Education ministers discuss joint projects to improve learning\\", Canada NewsWire, 1 October 2003, 12:58. In September 2004, the council announced that its priorities would be literacy, Aboriginal education, and postsecondary capacity. See \\"Three key priorities for ministers of education\\", Canada NewsWire, 28 September 2004, 14:22. Reid was critical of the Canadian Council on Learning introduced by Jean Chrétien's federal government, saying that its money would be better spent on provincial initiatives.Heather Sokoloff, \\"Learning curve\\", National Post, 21 April 2004, A17. Government services minister and backbencher Widely regarded as having mishandled the university funding and Jewish private school files, Reid was demoted to government services minister after a cabinet shuffle on February 18, 2005.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Demanding discipline, Charest cracks cabinet whip\\", Globe and Mail, 19 February 2005, A4; L. Ian MacDonald, \\"Quebec's government is in trouble\\" [editorial], National Post, 21 February 2005, A14. An editorial in the Montreal Gazette later described this as a \\"make-work\\" position for Reid.Don MacPherson, \\"New shuffle, same deck\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 28 February 2006, A21. This position offered him a much lower public profile, and he was dropped from cabinet entirely on February 27, 2006.Rhéal Séguin, \\"Two ministers booted from Quebec cabinet\\", Globe and Mail, 28 February 2006, A7. During his time as government services minister, Reid announced that the Charest government would replace an information management system approved by the previous ministry.Mike de Souza, \\"$1-billion info system gone; new one to cost half that\\", Montreal Gazette, 21 June 2005, A11. Reid supported the Charest government's plan to sell part of the Mont-Orford National Park to private interests in 2006, despite the concerns of environmental groups and some Liberal backbenchers.Pierre Reid, \\"Quebec's provincial park proposal is a balanced project\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 13 March 2006, A21. Critics noted that Reid was the friend of a key developer who stood to benefit from the sale, although Reid responded that his friend was only one of many potential buyers.Philip Authier, \\"Liberal brass lash back at Orford critics,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 March 2006, A8; Kevin Dougherty, \\"Orford bill is sweet deal: critic\\", Montreal Gazette, 19 May 2006, A12; Rita Legault, \\"MNA tries to dispel snowballing rumours about Orford plan\\", Sherbrooke Record, 16 March 2006, p. 1. Reid was narrowly re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, which reduced the Liberals to a minority government. He was returned to a third term in the 2008 election, as the Liberals regained majority status. He has not been returned to cabinet. In 2010, Reid and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper announced funding for a new arena in honour of hockey coach Pat Burns, who was suffering from and later died of terminal cancer. The arena is located in Stanstead, in Reid's Orford division.Bill Beacon, \\"Former NHL head coach Pat Burns has arena in Quebec named after him\\", Canadian Press, 26 March 2010, 18:37.

Some rides are only one day long, others may run as long as three days. One-day six-mile events have also become popular. The goal of the competition is to demonstrate partnership between horse and rider. Unlike in endurance riding, factors other than speed are considered. If the ride is timed, it is a form of pace race; otherwise it is a judged trail ride. In a timed ride, horses may not come in under or over a certain time, and veterinary checks, rider behavior and other elements play a role in the placings. The horse is evaluated on performance, manners, and related criteria. \\"Pulse and respiration\\" stops check the horse's recovery ability and conditioning. There are many different organizations which sanction competitive trail rides. Horsemanship may be considered at some competitions, depending on the sanctioning organization. Riders are evaluated on how they handle the trail, manage the horse, and present to the judges and veterinarians throughout the ride. Obstacles are also set up along the trail with the horse and rider graded on how well they perform as a team. Rides are often held on public lands, such as Forest Service or BLM lands in the United States, but are also held on private property. The terrain varies depending on the part of the country in which a competition is held, and lands available for the event. Unlike trail riding at a guest ranch, where inexperienced riders walk their horses most of the time and cover simple trails, riders who compete in competitive trail rides are asked to have their animals navigate a variety of terrain and use all gaits, especially the trot. Similar events exist around the world, though often with wide variations in rules and distances. In all cases, the most obvious difference between an endurance ride and a competitive trail ride is that the winner of an endurance ride is the first horse and rider team to cross the finish line and pass a vet check that deems the horse \\"fit to continue,\\" whereas competitive trail rides usually consider additional factors and penalize a horse and rider that finish in too little or too long of a time. Sanctioning organizations Competitive trail rides are sanctioned by numerous organizations in the United States, Canada and Europe. United States and Canada In the United States the sanctioning organizations of CTRs include the American Competitive Trail Horse Association ( ACTHA), the Canadian Competitive Trail Horse Association ( CATHA), North American Trail Ride Conference (NATRC), Eastern Competitive Trail Riding Association (ECTRA), South Eastern Distance Riders Association (SEDRA), Upper Midwest Endurance and Competitive Rides Association (UMECRA), Middle of the Trail Distance Riders Association (MODTRA), and others. In Canada, the umbrella group for the provincial organizations is the Canadian Long Distance Riding Association (CaLDRA). Provincial organizations are active in BC (BCCTRA), Alberta (TRAC), Saskatchewan (SLR), Manitoba (MTRC), Ontario and Quebec (OCTRA), and the Atlantic Region (ACTRA). The largest organization is NATRC, then followed by ECTRA; their ride philosophies differ primarily in that ACTHA and NATRC selects trail obstacles and ECTRA avoids them. ACTHA, NATRC, ECTRA and SEDRA use a \\"window\\" type of pace race, where time is a factor only to the extent that the horse and rider must complete the distance within minimum and maximum time limits. In contrast, TREC uses a \\"precision\\" type of pace race where the objective is to complete the course in exactly the time specified (see Pace race). {  - ! Sanctioning organization ! Region !

For two-day and three-day rides (multi-day), competitors arrive on the first day to set up camp for themselves and their horse or horses, riders present their horse to the judges for a physical exam and trot them in hand or longe (\\"lunge\\") them. The pre-ride examinations will be used to determine the fitness of that equine to start the ride. Equines showing evidence of contagious disease are ineligible to compete, and shall be promptly removed from the grounds. Any blemishes or other pre-existing conditions are noted. In the evening prior to the start of the ride, the riders are briefed in a general meeting. Maps are reviewed and veterinary hold criteria are given. The necessary ride speed is given, and if the ride is a window type pace race the minimum and maximum times are given. Depending on the organization that sanctions the ride, a CTR may begin with either staggered starts or one or more mass starts. Rides that involve judged trail obstacles often use staggered starts to reduce the competitors' waiting time to try the obstacles. Various organizations offer different divisions, based either on experience of the horse-rider team, age of the rider, weight of the rider, or other criteria. The average speed of a CTR usually is set between , depending on the level or division entered. With the exception of ACTHA competitions where the average speed is . This being due to the additional number of obstacles and general casualness of the events. The following morning, the ride itself begins. Competitors set their own pace and, unless instructed otherwise, in the gait they prefer. The choice of speed and gait in each segment of the ride is an important tactic. Competitors are observed by the judges at various points along the trail. The horse's pulse and respiration (\\"P&R;\\") are checked periodically, during mandatory holds and lunch stops. During these stops and holds, which are generally between 10–20 minutes or more depending on ride management, care is taken for rider and mount. Lunch is either provided by the rider or ride management depending on the CTR. Any feed given to the horse must be carried by the rider. When riders reach a certain mile marker at the end of the day's ride, they must maintain forward motion into camp, with no further stops allowed. Thus, it is the last opportunity to make timing adjustments. Riders who are ahead of time may stop at that point for as long as they like, but once leaving it, may not stop until they get into camp. The only exception to the rule is if the horse wishes to drink at a creek crossing, which is permitted in the interest of good horsemanship. However, riders are not to linger, but simply let the horse drink and move on. Riders behind schedule need to speed up to get to camp. At the end of the day, all horses are again presented to the judges for an exam. The horsemanship judge checks each competitor's trailer and camp for safety and care of the horse. If the competition is a one-day ride, awards for these horses and riders will be given. If a two-day or three-day ride, there is another ride briefing to recap the day and announce maps, trail, speed, distance and hold criteria for the following day. The ride on the next day is similar to the previous day in terms of routine and rules, but the distance may be shorter and the ride itself may be on a different trail. There will be a check of the horses' soundness before competitors are timed out to begin riding. After arriving back at camp, horses are cleaned up and presented to the judges one final time. When all the riders have completed the final check out, scores are tallied, an award ceremony is held and all riders are given their score cards. The exception being ACTHA events which are a one-day event. However many locations hold two events back to back. The only soundness exam is a lameness trot at the end of the ride. Preparing for competition Preparation well in advance of a competitive trail ride is critical. Competitors must not only have a well-trained horse in good physical condition, but also must be able to safely and effectively camp out with their horse, as stabling is not provided at rides. However many ACTHA events have hook ups or housing available. Conditioning the horse Before embarking on a competitive trail ride the horse must be up to the task. For the more demanding venues it takes a number of weeks, and sometimes months, of careful work to condition a horse to do of trail in a day. Conditioning needs to start easy and gradually build until the horse can physically and mentally handle the stress. Ideally this work should be done on natural terrain, including hills. Conditioning begins with riding about five days a week at a pace. After a couple of weeks, the shorter rides move to about and are done 3 times per week with one longer ride at a slow pace of about . After about six weeks at this schedule, the longer ride should be closer to and a typical horse in good health and sound will be well prepared to do a 15–25 mile CTR. The horse’s pulse and respiration are monitored as it is being worked to ensure that the workout creates an appropriate amount of physical stress. During this phase of training, the horse’s speed and duration of exercise allows for steady state heart rates below 150 to 170 beats per minute, which is the anaerobic threshold. The horse’s speed increases at these heart rates as the horse becomes more fit. Also, recovery heart rates will occur faster as the horse becomes more fit. A horse in good aerobic condition will have recovery heart rate around 100 beats per minute at two minutes post exercise when exercising at rates to induce heart rates near the anaerobic threshold. Recovery heart rates at 10 minutes post exercise should be less than 60 beats per minute. Riders need to be familiar with their horses' resting and working heart and respiration rates and know when an animal is stressed. This is an important part of the conditioning routine to ensure that a rider is able to anticipate the results at a P&R; check in competition. Equipment When packing for a competitive trail ride, the following items are included: *Horse supplies: tack, buckets, brushes *Horse feed, such as grain and hay *Personal supplies: clock, boots, and clothing, including rain gear. *Camping supplies: tent, sleeping bag, lantern, tarp, and other equipment. *Food supplies, cooking utensils, ice chest, camp stove. *Trailer and supplies *Fire extinguisher *First aid kit *Spare parts and repair supplies *Coggins test, veterinary certificate, brand inspection, and registration papers *Maps and directions *Trail supplies: watch, water bottles, hoof pick, knife, lead rope, halter, sponge on a string. Competition details There are nuances that allow competitors to obtain better scores throughout the competition that go beyond having a sound, well- conditioned horse that finishes within the given time. Horsemanship and horse care are also considered throughout the competition. Check in and inspection Upon arrival at the ride site, setting up camp competitors report to the ride secretary, complete registration, weigh in the rider and tack, and then provided with a ride packet. The ride packet contains a penny or number bib for the rider, a halter or bridle tag for the horse, and a number to be displayed on the horses stable area. Packets may also include an agenda, rider's list, and ride map. Often there are things like a piece of candy or gum, or a discount coupon? There is no weigh in at ACTHA events. The event is considered entered after registration, and the number bib assigned must be worn and all other required identification must be displayed. While presenting horses, judges may introduce themselves to the rider and answer any questions they might have. Most competitions have two or more judges, the horsemanship judge is looking for a rider who is attentive to the horse and to the vet judge. The vet judge assesses the condition of the horses to establish a baseline. The horse that looks as good on the last day as it did on the first day will score well. Blemishes, scars, and marks are noted. Points are not taken off for blemishes or minor cuts at check-in and are scored at checkout only if they are worse. The exception to this is soundness, which can be scored off at check-in, and if severe, may disqualify the horse from competition. The judge also notes if the horse will stand quietly for examination and allow its feet to be picked up, and this behavior is scored under manners on the horse's score card. At ACTHA events there are 6 judges. The horse and rider are judged in trail only. There is not a vet judge although vet and farrier services are normally near by. In hand presentations The horse is trotted out after the veterinary exam. This is both a horsemanship and a soundness component of the competition. There are two basic methods for in-hand presentations. The first method is to longe while the second one is to lead the horse in hand at a working trot in a wide circle, in opposite directions or in a figure eight, depending on the vet judge. It is the rider's option on which method to use. This presentation will be used to determine any lameness by the vet judges and maybe scored in horsemanaship. Calculating speed and pace The required speed for each division (in mph) is announced at the pre-ride briefing. Rate your miles – CTR – If the terrain allows, the following is a well-used rule of thumb: trot for six minutes then walk for three minutes. This also allows for an even distribution of work and rest. Many riders carry a \\"cheat sheet\\" with the times and mileages). This is an example of the \\"cheat sheet\\" that some use. {  - ! Miles to go: ! Watch reads: -  25  12:00 -  20  12:45 – 12:50 -  15  1:20 – 1:40 -  10  2:15 – 2:30 -  5  3:00 – 3:20 -  4  3:09 – 3:33 -  3  3:18 – 3:46 -  2  3:27 – 3:59 -  1  3:46 – 4:25 } Ride maps are sometimes provided which show distances between key markers along the trail. Based on this information, riders calculate what time they should be at each key marker. Miles divided speed equals the time. Riders multiply the fraction by 60 to get the minutes, add the minutes to the hours and arrive at the time. There are also mileage conversion charts available for riders who need them. Timing out, the start of the ride At most competitions, riders leave camp one at a time with their departure time recorded. This is not a racing start; horses need to stay relatively settled and maintain a safe distance between one another. Each competitor proceeds down the trail at the specified speed for the division entered. Riders commonly set their watch for 12:00 when they begin their ride in order to simplify their time calculations. Judging and obstacles encountered at some CTRs At various points along the trail, judges are posted. Sometimes they observe riders traverse some natural obstacle such as a deep gully or creek, large logs across the trail, or a bridge or boggy place. Other times, they give riders specific instructions, such as to back or sidepass the horse, open and close a gate, or travel at a specified gait such as the trot or canter. Riders may be asked to complete obstacles either in-hand or under saddle. If riders have to wait their turn, they must keep track of the time from arrival until they are able to be judged and give this time to the judge or their secretary. If riders finish the trail late, this time is given back to the competitor. Other examples of judged obstacles include: *Emergency stops from trot or canter. *Back between or around trees, uphill, or in water *Sidepass up to a tree, over log, or in water *Mount and dismount, including offside *Tie a ribbon on a tree or tree limb. *Climb or descend a bank, hill or cliff. *Step or back over a large log. Horses and riders often practice obstacles at home in order to build the trust and teamwork that enables them to be smooth on the trail. Any time riders are asked to do something they consider unsafe, or the horse is not ready to do, it is acceptable to \\"pass,\\" though the rider will lose points. Pulse and respiration stops There are generally one or two pulse and respiration (P&R;) holds, 10 to 20 minutes long each day (although there may be a third at the discretion of ride management). At most ride briefings, the trailmaster will indicate verbally or on maps where the P&R; stops will be. Depending on the mileage of the competition the first check usually occurs between after leaving camp. If there is a second hold it is another into the ride. When riders arrive at the P&R; checkpoint, a time will be recorded. After 10 minutes (first intermission), workers will come and check the horse's pulse and respiration. If the horse has a pulse or respiration rate over the criteria given, the horse is stressed and will be held at the P&R; an additional 10 minutes (second intermission). Holds are generally scored. If the horse still fails to meet the criteria specified by the judge, it is held for another 10-minute period (third intermission) and loses more points. After the third time, if the horse does not recover, it is pulled from competition and arrangements are made to trailer the horse back to camp. For each hold, 10 minutes is added to the maximum and minimum times to ensure that a horse that might be stressed is not stressed further trying to make up time. When the P&R; time is up and the organization's requirements are completed, the ride may proceed. It is considered good etiquette to wait until any adjoining horses are also done and ask permission from that rider before leaving. There aren't any P&R; stops at ACTHA events. Lunch stops Horses are timed into the lunch stop, when there is one, and must remain there for the time specified (generally 45 minutes). If water is available, horses drink and are wet down. Tack may be removed or loosened. At the end of the designated time, riders report back to the timer. Finish line Towards the end of a ride, most CTR organizations require the rider and mount to \\"maintain a forward motion (trot or gait equivalent)\\" at a certain mile marker before the finish line. This helps to assure that all horses reach the P&R; in a similar elevated state of exertion. Upon arriving back at camp, usually in the mid to late afternoon, all riders report to the timer after crossing the finish line and the times are noted. Multi-day teams on the first and second day, after checking in with the timer, return to their camp, remove tack, and get the horse ready to present to the vet judge at a preset time. Single day competitors and multi-day riders on the last day of the ride, may be subjected to a CRI/PR (cardiac recovery index) 10 minutes after crossing the finish line, depending on the organization. The horse and rider team may then return to their camp site to take care of their horse and any personal needs. After a preset time given at the ride brief, generally 60 to 90 minutes from their finish time, horses are again presented to the vet judge for a check similar to that performed at the check-in and can be extensive, looking for any differences in condition and attitude from how the horse looked at the beginning. Horsemanship division The horsemanship judge scores each rider's camp set up to ensure that each horse is being well cared for and note any safety issues. Judges may answer questions from competitors at these times. Awards Most organizations offer awards, first through sixth place in each class and division as well as breed awards. These might come from the breed association, donations, or other. Many times, first time riders are given special recognition. And those who had especially hard luck, or were very lost, might be recognized. Awards include ribbons, certificates, plaques, or useful items such as hoof pick, brush, or halter. In most CTR organizations, cash prizes are not allowed. Significant awards, such as bridles, buckles, chairs, and even on occasion, saddles are given as awards to the high point horse, high point rider, mileage, divisions and many others. In addition to ride ribbons and ride awards, ACTHA maintains a very extensive of medal awards rewarding participation and attendance. Awards include clothing up to saddles and $500 shopping credits ( www.actha.us/medals ). Common scoring criteria Typically, condition, soundness, \\"trail ability\\" and horsemanship are all scored. Condition includes: *P&R; scores *Mucous membrane coloration (MM), noted by gum color – the normal color of gums is a light pink. A whitish, dark pink, reddish-deep pink, or blue gum color is an indication of a medical issue. *Muscle tone (MT) *Capillary refill time (CRT) *Hydration (hyd) – checked by a pinch test done at the base of the neck close to the shoulder *Gut sounds, a check for colic, overheating, and other forms of distress. *Movement, attitude and willingness (MAW) * ACTHA confines soundness to rider discretion and the judged soundness trot by at the end of the ride. Chronic stumbling or forging may be penalized. A horse that develops thumps, colic, dehydration, or ties up is removed from competition so that immediate medical attention can be provided. Soundness includes: *Gait *Leg or tendon soreness – heat or pain may be penalized. Blemishes are noted at check- in and are generally not penalized. *Withers, back, loin or girth (WBLG) soreness – often influenced by tack fit rider balance. *Edema, rubs, or inflammation at cinch, mouth, chin groove, or legs Horses in poor physical condition or who are unsound are pulled from competition if they fail to pass veterinary inspections or show distress at any time of the event. ACTHA events do not include vet exams during, before or after events. Some symptoms of concern include: *Excessively high respiration rate: if the horse does not recover appropriately at the P&R; it may be pulled. *Lameness *Dehydration *\\"Tying-up\\" *Thumps – when a horse develops constant, rhythmic ticking in the flanks. In a severe case, the whole abdomen will have this ticking motion. *Colic Trail ability and manners includes: *Standing quietly for examination and when a rider mounts. *Attention to rider, attentiveness to the trail, sure-footed and well controlled at all times. *Maneuverability on obstacles. Horses are to accomplish tasks quietly and be attentive to the rider. *Disobedience, head tossing, buddying, or refusals are penalized. *Exceeding time limits for obstacles is penalized. Horsemanship criteria includes: *Horse grooming *In-hand presentation *Saddle and other tack fit *Rider form and balance, trail safety and courtesy. * In Actha events the rider's riding ability and relationship to the horse are the primary criteria for horsemanship judging. Electrolyte supplementation The use of electrolyte supplementation for horses, common in endurance riding, is controversial in CTR. The need for electrolytes tends to vary greatly from horse to horse and may also be influenced by region and climate. A horse loses body water and salts through perspiration and urination, and replenishes itself by drinking water. Normally, a horse will naturally adjust the electrolyte balance in its body if given free access to salt (sodium chloride) and water, but this is not always possible during a competition. A horse that is dehydrated has an elevated electrolyte level in its body, which should cause thirst. If a horse does not drink, giving electrolytes (by squirting a paste in the back of the horse's mouth) can further elevate the level, hence cause greater thirst, possibly inducing a reluctant horse to drink. However, giving electrolytes to a dehydrated horse can also further disturb the electrolyte balance, resulting in serious medical problems such as thumps, muscle spasms, and tying up. If the weather is hot and humid, or horses are moving at a faster speed, horses are more likely to need supplemental electrolytes. Usually, horses that drink regularly have little need for electrolyte supplementation. Excitable, anxious horses or horses that sweat excessively for any reason may need supplementation.

The Sentinel has been published at Rockhurst since 1917. For a brief period during the 1990s, The Sentinel was called The Hawk before it changed its name back to The Sentinel in 2001. The Editorial staff is run by the students of Rockhurst. Although there is a faculty adviser, the students make all decisions regarding the content and direction of the paper. The Sentinel focuses heavily on events around the Rockhurst campus. The content is specifically geared towards the student body and usually includes campus news, commentary, features, and humor pieces. Two of the more popular features among the students are the Security Report and \\"Mockhurst,\\" which depicts student life through characters based on the university mascot, the Hawk. Mockhurst was created by then editor Matt Nickson and staff contributor Sal Avitia. The strip gained attention from students, as well as administrators, in the wake of unpopular restrictions often mocked in the strip; including the use of hot tubs on campus and alcohol usage by student residents 21 and over. The strip used characters such as Dr.Mark Slow, representing Dr. Matt Quick and Ms. Kate Wolf, representing director of housing, Ms. Kim Bear. The Sentinel is published around every two weeks in print and online . Some more recent editions of The Sentinel can be found online in the archives.

Biography Riggs began his musical career as lead guitarist for the Knoxville, Tennessee group, Lynx, a popular staple on the local bar circuit in the mid-1970s. The band, featuring Michael Byassee on vocals, soon relocated to Atlanta, Georgia. There, musician Don Train (\\"Stormtrooper\\") recruited Riggs and fellow guitarist Jeremy Graf to join his group \\"Raggedy Ann\\". The band recorded a series of demos at Last Stand Studios in 1978. By 1979, the band was being courted by major producers and new demo tapes were cut in Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, resulting in new management and recording deals. When Don Train elected to leave the group and return to Philadelphia in 1980, Jerry Riggs replaced him as frontman and the band became known as Riggs. Two of the band's songs \\"Radar Rider\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\" were featured prominently in the 1981 animated feature film Heavy Metal. The songs were performed by Jerry Riggs, Jeremy Graf, Dave Ridarick and Steve Carlisle. The songs were also included on the movie's soundtrack release. Riggs' debut album on the Full Moon label was released shortly after, but failed to make much of an impact on the music scene. One song, \\"Ready Or Not\\", was a minor hit, but the album otherwise went unnoticed. Riggs began working with Canadian rocker Pat Travers in 1983 and joined the Pat Travers Band as co-lead guitarist. At the time Riggs joined, Travers was at the end of his most successful period. The band became a staple on the North American nightclub circuits during the latter half of the 1980s and toured constantly. At headlining shows, Riggs performed at least one of his original songs, and \\"Ready Or Not\\" was always a crowd favorite. He also showcased his skills with a very memorable guitar solo. A few of Riggs' original compositions made it onto Travers' 1990 release School Of Hard Knocks. One Riggs-penned track was an instrumental entitled Guitars From Hell, which featured fretwork from both he and Travers. Riggs is also featured in the 1991 video release Boom Boom- Live At The Diamond Club, a full-length concert filmed in Toronto which features Travers' greatest hits, as well as \\"Ready Or Not\\" by Riggs. Although one of his songs was included in this video release, Jerry Riggs' guitar solo was not. Riggs left Travers' group in 1993 and now lives in Florida. He performs regularly with Bobby Friss, whose Bobby Friss Band has a large and loyal following in Florida, as well as Michigan, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. He also performs with \\"Rock and Pop Masters\\", a self-described group of musicians / business professionals who deliver \\"authentic, high quality, custom-tailored “Classic Rock” events\\". The band Riggs has reunited for occasional one night engagements, most recently on November 28, 2009, playing at The Loft in Atlanta. Riggs started touring as a lead guitarist with 38 Special in 2019.

As pioneers in advocacy and professional development, it capitalizes on the intersection of art and enterprise by activating collaborative partnerships and developing innovative resources. The Chicago Artists Coalition is committed to cultivating groundbreaking exhibitions and educational opportunities, and to building a diverse community of artistic leaders that defines the place of art and artists in our culture and economy. History The Chicago Artists Coalition was founded in 1974 by a group of artists who sought to create a better environment and future for the artistic community living and working in the Chicago area. It was modeled after the Boston Visual Artists' Union, Inc. and officially incorporated in 1975. Historically, the organization has played an important role in artists' professional development and local/regional advocacy. It was instrumental in the establishment of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs (now the Department of Cultural Affairs & Special Events); proved vital in advocating for the Percent for Art bill, helped found the Chicago Artists Month, and was involved in the creation of Arts Alliance Illinois, the state advocacy organization. Since 2010, the Coalition began to grow significantly in its programming and operations, guided by strategic planning initiatives and multi-year capacity-building grants. In 2011, the Coalition relocated to the West Loop neighborhood in downtown Chicago, which is home to many of the city's top contemporary arts galleries and artist-run spaces. The organization currently operates in an 8,000 square foot historic building that contains a lofty gallery/program space, artist residency studios, and administrative offices. In 2012, the Coalition acquired the Chicago Artists Resource website, known as CAR, which expanded the organization's services and outreach to artists working in multiple disciplines. Programs The Chicago Artists Coalition's core programs provide educational training, exhibition/residency initiatives and marketplace building for artists and a diverse arts public. BOLT Residency is a competitive, juried, year-long program that provides participating artists with dedicated studio workspace, a solo exhibition, one-on-one studio visits with leading arts professionals, and community-building. Chicago Artists Resource (CAR) is a comprehensive online platform that connects, educates and empowers artists and the arts community. Collectors Circle is a special membership level and event series dedicated to building a community of emerging and established collectors who share a strong interest in supporting Chicago art. FIELD/WORK is a year-round program of workshops, personalized consultations, peer learning exchanges, and tutorials that provides artists of all disciplines and career stages with the skills needed for creative and professional success. The FIELD/WORK Residency is an educational program designed for artists wanting a deeper engagement in vital issues in artists' professional development, critical feedback, and support in designing a pathway to progress with individual career goals. HATCH Projects is a year- long incubator for emerging artists and curators who collectively produce group exhibitions and related programming throughout the year. This program fosters shared experimentation, exchange, and creativity to produce ground- breaking exhibitions and programs. LAUNCH Invitational Residency is a professional development residency for recent BA and BFA graduates. Offered to a limited number of promising students nominated by faculty, the four-day-long experience creates a rigorous environment within which artists learn career- building skills from both professionals and peers. MAKER Grant is an annual, unrestricted award opportunity for Chicago-based contemporary visual artists who demonstrate a commitment to a sustainable artistic practice and career development. Special Projects include a variety of partnerships with businesses and other organizations to facilitate commissions and other opportunities for artists. Past examples include installing permanent murals in the 1871 technology incubator; organizing art competitions and exhibitions with Groupon, Patrón Spirits, Chicago Art Loop Alliance, and Taste of Chicago; and facilitating commissions in retail/hotel developments in collaboration with Gensler. The ANNUAL is a new yearly sales exhibition running concurrently with EXPO Chicago that celebrates cutting edge Chicago-based artists. The Annual creates an accessible forum for emerging collectors to discover affordable new work and engage directly with its creators. This sales exhibition builds upon the success of the satellite art fair EDITION Chicago, which first launched in September 2013.

The modern form of the Rhode Island Lottery was inaugurated in 1974, following a constitutional amendment passed in 1973. It is a charter member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Rhode Island Lottery games include Mega Millions, Powerball, Wild Money, keno, and scratch tickets. Rhode Island also offers video lottery, which includes the multi- jurisdictional MegaHits game. The minimum age to play the Rhode Island Lottery is 18. History Lotteries played an important role in Rhode Island from the colonial period until the mid-19th Century. They were banned by the colonial legislature in 1732, only to be brought back in 1744. They continued, generally under control of the Rhode Island General Assembly, until being banned again in 1842. The lottery was reintroduced in 1974, as Rhode Island joined several states, including New Hampshire, New York, and New Jersey, in introducing state lotteries. It is a charter member of the Multi-State Lottery Association In June 2018, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo signed legislation permitting sports betting within the state, which is currently overseen and regulated by the Rhode Island Lottery, and run by William Hill. Current draw games In-house draw games =The Numbers Game= Begun in 1976, it was the first Rhode Island Lottery game where players could select their numbers. Nightly, four sets of balls numbered 0 through 9 are drawn. Prizes and options vary. Rhode Island, unusually, does not draw a three-digit number separately; however, players can choose \\"first three\\" or \\"last three\\". \\"Midday\\" drawings for The Numbers Game have been added. =Wild Money= Wild Money is drawn Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It draws 5 balls numbered 1-35, with an \\"Extra Ball\\" drawn from the remaining 30. The \\"Extra Ball\\" is used to determine some of the prizes, but not the jackpot, which starts at $20,000. Games are $1. =Keno (limited availability)= Keno is played at retailers equipped with a special monitor. Drawings are 4 minutes apart during Keno hours. Prizes and options vary. =Bingo= Bingo drawings take place every 8 minutes. Retailers are equipped with a monitor displaying the drawings. 30 numbers are drawn. Players must match the called numbers to their numbers on the display to create Bingo patterns. The object is to match one of the Rhode Island Lottery Bingo patterns. Multi- jurisdictional games =Mega Millions= Rhode Island joined Mega Millions on January 31, 2010; it was part of the cross-sell expansion that took place on that date. (Most U.S. lotteries with either Mega Millions or Powerball joined the other on that date; the agreement was finalized on October 13, 2009.) Mega Millions is drawn Tuesdays and Fridays; its starting jackpot is $15 million. Games are $2 each, or $3 if the \\"Megaplier\\" multiplier is activated. =Powerball= Rhode Island was among the seven founding members of MUSL, formed in 1987. Its best-known game, Powerball, began in 1992. Games are $2 each; a PowerPlay game is $3. The \\"PowerPlay\\" option began in 2001. Jackpots start at $40 million; it is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Powerball has undergone several format changes. The first was in 1997, which introduced its cash option. Its current format began in 2015. Power Play winnings again are determined by a random multiplier. Rhode Island's largest lottery prize was $336,400,000 (annuity value) for the February 11, 2012 drawing; the cash option was chosen. =MegaHits (video lottery)= Rhode Island's two lottery-run casinos (Twin River in Lincoln and Newport Grand in Newport) offer MegaHits, MUSL's second video lottery terminal (VLT) progressive jackpot game. MegaHits began in 2011; it replaced Cashola. (Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia also offer MegaHits.) MegaHits features five jackpots; the top progressive's minimum is $100,000. All MegaHits jackpots are paid in cash. The maximum wager must be made to be eligible for any of the progressives. (All MegaHits wagers feed the top progressive level; however, the other progressives are fed by MegaHits wagers within that lottery's jurisdiction.) =Lucky For Life= In 2009, the Connecticut Lottery began an in-state game called Lucky4Life. It was replaced three years later by a regional game with a modified name: Lucky for Life (LFL), adding Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island. The current LFL, which began on September 17, 2013, costs $2 per play. Players pick 5 of 43 white balls, and 1 of 43 green \\"Lucky Balls.\\" First and second prizes are \\"lifetime\\" annuities: $1,000 per day for a perfect match (5+1), or $25,000 per year for a 5+0 match. A winner of either lifetime annuity can choose cash instead of the periodic payments. On January 27, 2015, LFL became a \\"quasi-national game\\"; as of 2017 it is offered in 22 states and the District of Columbia; with an additional three states planning to join. Former games Lot-O-Bucks Lot-O-Bucks was the Rhode Island Lottery's first terminal-based jackpot game. It ended in 1995. Lot-O-Bucks used several different number matrixes, most recently a pick-5-of-40. Cashola The first MUSL video lottery progressive, Cashola, began in July 2006; it ended when its 37th jackpot was won, on May 15, 2011. Cashola's jackpot was its only progressive level.

They may be British citizens or non-citizen immigrants. Historical migration of royalty Spanish and English royalty intermarried on numerous occasions, a notable example is found in King Edward I and Eleanor of Castile, parents of King Edward II. In 1501, Catherine of Aragon came to London aged 15. After the early death of her first husband, she became Henry VIII’s first wife. Their daughter, Mary Tudor attempted to re-introduce Catholicism as the state religion during her own reign and married Philip II of Spain. Both women at that time brought the influence of Spanish culture to the royal court. Demographics The 2001 UK Census recorded 54,482 Spanish-born people. 54,105 of these were resident in Great Britain (that is, the UK excluding Northern Ireland). The equivalent figure in the 1991 Census was 38,606. The census tracts with the highest numbers of Spanish-born residents in 2001 were Kensington, Regent's Park and Chelsea, all in west London. The 2011 UK Census recorded 77,554 Spanish-born residents in England, 1,630 in Wales, 4,908 in Scotland and 703 in Northern Ireland. According to Instituto Nacional de Estadística statistics, the number of Spanish citizens registered with the Spanish consulate in the UK was 102,498 as of 1 January 2016. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the Spanish-born population of the UK was 125,000 in 2015. Economics According to analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research, 71.22 per cent of recent Spanish immigrants to the UK of working age are employed as opposed to unemployed or inactive (which includes students), compared to 73.49 per cent of British-born people. 15.05 per cent of recent Spanish-born immigrants are low earners, defined as having an income of less than £149.20 per week (compared to 21.08 per cent of British-born people), and 2.15 per cent are high earners, earning more than £750 per week (compared to 6.98 per cent of British-born people).

Collegiate career Unable to enroll at Penn State due to the college's post-World War II policy of giving admissions priority to returning veterans, Rogel spent the 1946 season playing at the California State Teachers College. Along with other top-tier talent awaiting admission, he helped propel the Vulcans football team to a 9-0-0 record. Rogel continued on to Penn State, where he was a star fullback and linebacker for three seasons. He was the Nittany Lions' leading rusher each of those seasons and was on the 1948 Cotton Bowl Classic team which tied Southern Methodist, 13-13. NFL and CFL Rogel was drafted by the Steelers in the eighth round (#100 overall) in the 1950 NFL Draft, and he did not miss a game his eight seasons with the team (1950–1957). Rogel's style of play was characterized by \\"Hey Diddle Diddle, Rogel up the middle\\" — a popular cheer by Steelers fans. Head coach Walt Kiesling, a conservative-minded coach, started nearly every game by running the same play: \\"Rogel up the middle.\\" One day, owner Art Rooney suggested to Kiesling to throw it instead. Not wanting to be undermined by Rooney, Kiesling had one of his lineman intentionally go offsides so it could nullify the play. Sure enough, against the rival Cleveland Browns, quarterback Jim Finks threw a touchdown pass that was nullified by the penalty. The following play after the penalty would be \\"Rogel up the middle.\\" Rogel was a Pro Bowl selection in 1956. By the time of his retirement following the 1957 season, he was the Steelers' leading career rusher with 3,271 yards. Rogel also played briefly in the Canadian Football League. In 1959 Rogel was the playing coach of the Sarnia Golden Bears in the semi-pro ORFU. Because of his running style he was nicknamed \\"twinkle toes\\". For eight years during the 1960s, Rogel was head football coach at North Braddock Scott High School and for eight years in the 1970s he was head coach at Highlands High School in Natrona Heights, PA. His teams made one playoff appearance. Death Rogel died of Parkinson's disease at age 74 on June 3, 2002, in Richland, Pennsylvania.

The film stars many of the local travellers as themselves, and many well known north-east actors, such as Sammy Johnson. Plot Ray drives to a block of flats in Sunderland to collect Betty who is his partner. They drive on to a pub for a wedding night time party. Unknown to Betty, Ray is in the process of doing a deal with one of his friends. The party is full of Ray's old associates who are seacoalers that work and live on the Lynemouth coast, reclaiming waste coal that is washed in on the tide. Without informing Betty, Ray buys a caravan on the seacoalers' camp. Betty wakes the next morning to find herself in the run-down caravan, and is shocked to learn of Ray's decision to set up again as a seacoaler. Nevertheless, she agrees to move in with him to get herself and her daughter Corrina away from her violent ex-husband. Betty cleans and decorates the caravan, turning it into a home for the three, and becomes content with living on the camp and working as a seacoaler. Betty makes friends with two other women, Rosie and Val. Ray manages to persuade an old resident of the camp, Ronnie, to allow Ray to use his address to fiddle his dole payments, as living in a caravan they have no actual address. Betty is outraged to discover that all their hard work gathering about 15 tons of coal has accumulated to £40. Ray then goes ahead and without consulting Betty sells his car and buys a horse, which sets him up as a freelance seacoaler; this enables him to get a better rate for his collected coal.

What Is the Third Estate? () is a political pamphlet written in January 1789, shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolution, by the French writer and clergyman Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836). The pamphlet was Sieyès' response to finance minister Jacques Necker's invitation for writers to state how they thought the Estates- General should be organized. In the pamphlet, Sieyès argues that the third estate – the common people of France – constituted a complete nation within itself and had no need of the \\"dead weight\\" of the two other orders, the first and second estates of the clergy and aristocracy. Sieyès stated that the people wanted genuine representatives in the Estates-General, equal representation to the other two orders taken together, and votes taken by heads and not by orders. These ideas came to have an immense influence on the course of the French Revolution. Summary The pamphlet is organized around three hypothetical questions and Sieyès' responses. The questions and responses are: *What is the Third Estate? Everything. *What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing. *What does it desire to be? To become something... Throughout the pamphlet, Sieyès argues that the first and second estates are simply unnecessary, and that the Third Estate is in truth France's only legitimate estate, representing as it does the entire population. Thus, he asserts, it should replace the other two estates entirely. The Third Estate bears the weight of the majority of tax.

Their musical style is a blend of Machine Head's groove metal and Paradise Lost's gothic metal; their lyrical matter, however, unusually to the style, often revolves around the darker side of agriculture - bestiality and incest (\\"Farm Sweet Farm\\"), torture of animals (\\"When a Chicken Cries For Love\\"), suicide (\\"Relieve the Tension\\") and slaughterhouses (\\"When Pigs Fly\\"). Their later albums have strayed away from the subject matter. Matthias Sayer also provided guest vocals for Apocalyptica's single Hope Vol.2.

During the fifties, sixties and early seventies, he traveled extensively around the globe with his group Los Paraguayos, popularizing Paraguayan music. He is the best-selling Paraguayan musician ever. Family and early life He was born on 21 June 1926 at 14:30 in Altos, Paraguay. His birth was reported in the magistrates court on 14 August 1926 by his mother, Jacinta Mesa (not Meza). His name was Luis Osmer Meza. Luis was the fourth son of eight children, of whom one was a girl, Obdulia (Chiquita), a retired singer. Doña Jacinta, Paraná's mother died on 15 August 1965, while Luis was in Stockholm touring in Europe; Luis's father, who was a rural teacher, died in Piripucú, Concepción in 1947. Luis attended primary school in Ypacaraí. At the age of 14, Luis entered the boy-scouts in \\"Batallón Rojas Silva \\" (Salesianito), under Father Ernesto Pérez Acosta's management. Adult life and artistic career \\"The fact that he was meant to be an artist was clear from the age of eighteen, when he interpreted 'Campo Grande' alongside Humberto Barúa and Digno García, a great harpist. It was there, in the old Rex theatre, that people started to feel attracted by this young, enthusiastic countryside boy.\\" After touring through Central America, Luis Alberto del Paraná (artistic name adopted in Mexico) formed a band with Digno García and Agustin Barboza. This band was named \\"Los Paraguayos Threesome\\" and by decree, 24 November 1953, the national government gave each one of the members 3200 dollars to disseminate Paraguayan music in Europe through an \\"Official Cultural Mission\\". His first wife was Lissette Cairoly, a French \\"circus princess\\". His second wife was Carmen González Caballero, a Spanish dancer. They had two children: Luis Manuel Meza González and Carmen Fabiola Meza González. In (1958), in Milan, (Italy), Paraná gave Father Pérez a complete set of percussion instruments for his former Scout Battalion to use. Later on, Paraná dedicated a song to Father Pérez. This song was included in an LP issued by Philips International and was distributed world wide. When the contract expired, the band dissolved and Paraná formed the band \\"Los Paraguayos\\" with his brother Reynaldo Meza, Rubito Medina, and José de los Santos González, a harpist. They quickly recorded two LP's for Philips in the Netherlands: \\"Famous Latin American Songs\\" and \\"Ambassador of Romance\\", which had great success. This was the start of the recording of \\"more than 500 songs\\". They recorded hit after hit until Paraná died. They shared the stage with The BeatlesThe Beatles: a diary. An intimate day by day story by Barry Miles. Page 86. Omnibus Press, 1998. and recorded with The Rolling Stones. Luis Alberto del Paraná and \\"Los Paraguayos\\" played live at the Benny Hill show \\"Season 1 Episode 3\\" (1970) Luis Alberto del Paraná and \\"Los Paraguayos\\" sold more than 30 000 000 records, more than 650 000 tape cassettes, and traveled more than 1 000 000 kilometers during their tours.Plaque at trophy presented to them by Philips, in the exhibition at \\"El Cabildo\\" museum, Asunción, Paraguay. Death and burial He died on 15 September 1974, aged 48, in London, England. He was at the first floor of the Pembridge Court Hotel, in room eight when he suffered from a brain stroke. His casket was transported to Asunción, where it was carried off the plane by many dignitaries, including the President. It was a huge event rarely seen by the nation. The people spontaneously packed the streets to say goodbye to their idol. This event was named \\"The Chain of Pain\\" and almost all of the radio stations in Paraguay and many around the world tuned in to transmit every minute of the episode until his burial in \\"La Recoleta Cemetery\\", in the San Bernardino District.

It is an invasive species and now has a pantropical distribution.Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) (2007) PIER species lists, retrieved 4/30/2007 Mimosa diplotricha It is commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, giant false sensitive plant, or nila grass. Taxonomy Mimosa diplotricha is classified under the genus Mimosa in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the legume family, Fabaceae. It was first described by the American botanist Charles Wright in 1869. The specific epithet is derived from Ancient Greek διπλόος (diplóos, \\"double\\") and θρίξ (thríx, \\"hair\\"). Mimosa diplotricha was also described earlier by the German botanist Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius as Mimosa invisa in 1837. But he had already given the name Mimosa invisa in 1834 to a different species. The name he gave is therefore a heterotypic posterior homonym and thus nomen illegitimum. Wright's name becomes the earliest correct name for the species, while the name Mimosa invisa is now accepted as the correct name for Mimosa rhodostachya. However the name Mimosa invisa is still used incorrectly by some authors for Mimosa diplotricha. Mimosa diplotricha includes three varieties: *Mimosa diplotricha var. diplotricha C. Wright ex Sauvalle\\\\- The nominate variety. Characterized by seed pods that are long, with 3 to 8 seeds. *Mimosa diplotricha var. odibilis Barneby \\\\- Found only in Mexico, from Sinaloa to Michoacán. Characterized by seed pods that are long, with 12 to 16 seeds. * Mimosa diplotricha var. inermis (Adelbert) Verdcourt \\\\- A thornless variety found in tropical Asia. It appears to be a de novo mutation that first arose in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Common names Mimosa diplotricha is known as the giant sensitive plant, giant false sensitive plant, or nila grass in English. In the Americas, it is known dormilona de playa, rabo de iguana; and raspancilla in Spanish; and grande sensitive or sensitive géante in French. It is also known as sensitiva trepadora in Cuba; and analeira, dormideira, juquiri-rasteiro, malicia-de-mulher, or sensitiva in Brazil. In South Asia and Indochina it is known as anthottawadi or padaincha in India; banla saet in Cambodia; cõ trinh nu móc in Vietnam; and maiyaraap thao in Thailand. In Southeast Asia it is known as duri semalu in Malaysia; makahiyang lalaki, bulunsari, or balansuri in the Philippines; boring, borang, djoekoet borang, or puteri malu in Nusa Tenggara; pis koetjing in Indonesia; and rèmbètè in Java. In Oceania it is known as nila grass in Papua New Guinea; co gadrogadro, ', or ' in Fiji; vao fefe palagi or la'au fefe palagi in Samoa and the American Samoa; singbiguin sasa in Saipan; mechiuaiuu in Palau; and pikika'a papa'a in the Cook Islands. Description Mimosa diplotricha leaves that have curled up after being touched Mimosa diplotricha grows as an erect shrub or a scrambling climber, reaching a height of around . Its leaves are bipinnate and bright green with a feathery appearance. They are arranged alternately along the stems. Each leaf contains around twenty pairs of small sessile lanceolate leaflets arranged opposite each other. Each leaflet measures around long and wide. Like the related Mimosa pudica, the leaves are sensitive to touch, and will curl up if disturbed. The stems are characteristically very long. They are squarish in cross-section, with four ridges running lengthwise. A dense row of very sharp recurved thorns run along the ridges, each around long. The flowers are pale pink and looks like a clustered fluffy ball. They are around in diameter and arise from short stalks from the leaf joints. The corolla is fused (gamopetalous), and there are two stamens for every petal. The flowers develop into clustered slightly curved seed pods. Each seed pod is more or less flat and covered with small prickles. They are around long and wide. The seeds are oval-shaped and flat, each around long and thick. They are light brown and polished in appearance. They are dispersed through running water or by sticking to fur or clothing. They can remain dormant for up to 50 years. Distribution Mimosa diplotricha is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America and Central America, including parts of the Caribbean. It is not known, however, if the species is native to North America. Invasive species Mimosa diplotricha is fast-growing and can tolerate a wide range of soil and climate conditions. Left alone, they can form impenetrable thickets within a short period that can affect movement of both people and animals, as well as planted crops. All parts of the plant are toxic to grazing animals. Mimosa diplotricha is extremely invasive and rapidly colonizes areas it is introduced to. The earliest records of Mimosa diplotricha outside of the Americas is in Java, Indonesia in 1900; Queensland, Australia in 1929; and Fiji in 1936. Since then, it has rapidly spread and naturalized throughout Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii), northern regions of Australia, and parts of Africa in the latter half of the 20th century.

F1 is only a part of a larger ATP synthase complex known as Complex V. It is a peripheral membrane protein attached to component Fo, which is integral to the membrane.Cox, Michael M. and David L. Nelson. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry 4th Edition. New York: WH Freeman and Company. 2005  Early life  Efraim Racker was born to a Jewish family in 1913 in Neu Sandez, Poland (then Austrian Galicia), but he grew up in Vienna. His elder brother, Heinrich Racker, was to become a famous psychoanalyst. Efraim Racker was studying medicine at the University of Vienna when Hitler invaded in 1938. Racker fled to Great Britain, where he took a job in a mental hospital in Wales. His research focused on the biochemical causes for mental diseases. During the war, Racker was given the opportunity to practice medicine, but he decided to move to the United States to continue his research.Kresge, Nicole, Robert D. Simoni and Robert L. Hill. \\"Unraveling the Enzymology of Oxidative Phosphorylation: The Work of Efraim Racker\\". Journal of Biological Chemistry Vol. 281, Issue 4. January 27, 2006. http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/281/4/e4 Career In the U.S., he accepted a position as a research associate in physiology at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis from 1941 to 1942. While investigating the biochemical basis for brain diseases, he discovered that the polio virus inhibited glycolysis in the brains of mice. He eventually left his research position for a job as a physician at the Harlem Hospital in New York City. In 1944 he became an associate professor of microbiology at the New York University Medical School, where he continued his work on glycolysis. In 1952 he accepted a position at Yale Medical School, but left after two years to accept the position of chief of the Nutrition and Physiology Department at the Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York. It was here that Racker demonstrated that glycolysis was dependent on ATPase and the continuous regeneration of ADP and phosphate. Maynard E. Pullam joined Racker's staff in 1953, and decided to uncover the mechanism of ATP synthesis in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Joined by Anima Datta and Harvey S. Penefsky, they set out to identify the enzymes used in ATP synthesis. Racker left the Public Health Research Institute in 1966 to found the biochemistry department at Cornell University. He continued his research at Cornell, and was awarded many honors and prizes, including the Warren Triennial Prize in 1974, the National Medal of Science in 1976, the Gairdner Award in 1980, and the America Society of Biological Chemistry's Sober Memorial Lectureship. In addition, he was appointed to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. Efraim Racker died in 1991, leaving colleague and friend Dr. Mossaad Abdel-Ghany to take care of his lab and graduate students, but not before coining the phrase, \\"Don’t waste clean thinking on dirty enzymes,\\" which is often quoted as one of \\"The Ten Commandments of Enzymology\\". Discovery Racker and his associates, Anima Datta, Maynard Pullmand, and Harvey Penefsky, worked to isolate the enzymes involved in ATP synthesis. They observed that isolated mitochondrial fragments were capable of respiration but not able to synthesize ATP. Racker and his co-workers concluded that oxidative phosphorylation could be restored by addition of the supernatant from the centrifuging. The complex making this restoration possible was named Factor 1 or F1 as it is a necessary coupling factor for ATPase activity. This discovery of the first enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation was identified and purified in 1960.\\"Efraim Racker\\". Biographical Memoirs, Volume 70. National Academy of Sciences. 1996. http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/eracker.html The factor that binds F1 to the membrane, Fo, was discovered later in conjunction with Yasuo Kagawa. This particle was found to be sensitive to the antibiotic oligomycin and thus named Fo. This discovery had the added benefit of silencing any critics of the role of F1 in oxidative phosphorylation because it conferred oligomycin sensitivity on the ATPase activity complex. Once both of these factors were identified Racker was able to confirm Peter D. Mitchell's hypothesis that contrary to popular opinion, ATP synthesis was not coupled to respiration through a high-energy intermediate but instead by a transmembrane proton gradient. ATPsynthase http://www.atpsynthase.info/Basics.html F1 is a critical part of ATP synthesis within the mitochondria. In its absence, Complex V is not able to create the proton gradient necessary to produce ATP. It is responsible for coupling the oxidation of nutrients to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphates. In September 6, 1991, Racker was felled by a severe stroke, and died in Syracuse three days after.

Prior to Hernandez' arrest and a relative's revelations about his confessions, many authorities believed that Jose Ramos, convicted of other sex crimes, was responsible for Etan Patz' disappearance. Prosecutors first involved Welner at the early stages after the arrest, before filing charges, to consider defense claims from several psychologists that Hernandez was mentally ill and intellectually disabled and falsely confessed. The defense presented multiple expert opinions in support of their claims that Hernandez was and that his confessions were unreliable. Welner interviewed Hernandez for sixteen hours, interviewed police, studied confessions he had made many years earlier to a prayer group and to a fiancée, as well as to an acquaintance, and the more recent confessions he made to police interrogators in 2012, medical staff, as well as Welner himself. Welner concluded that Hernandez confessed because he felt intense guilt and that the spontaneous, voluntary confessions Hernandez made decades earlier to a prayer group and his fiancée couldn't be attributed to a psychiatric condition. The case proceeded to trial in 2015. Eleven jurors voted guilty, with one holdout juror remaining after nearly three weeks of deliberation. Dr. Welner testified for prosecutors at the original trial and then at the retrial, in which a jury unanimously rendered a guilty verdict to Hernandez in early 2017. Among other points, Welner told jurors it was possible Hernandez tried to minimize the damage he'd done even though he confessed. \\"It is not remarkable at all for a person to recall a sequence of events and to portray it in a way that is as unremarkable as possible, scrubbing away details … (creating a) much more detached relationship between that person and a victim.\\"  U.S. vs. Brian David Mitchell – Elizabeth Smart kidnappers  Brian David Mitchell, a self-proclaimed prophet, was charged along with his wife in connection with the 2002 kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. In a case involving the complexities of determining religious zeal from psychosis, Mitchell had been found not competent to stand trial in 2005. Mitchell then began a consistent pattern of singing hymns in court and silence to forensic examiners. Subsequent evaluations in a state hospital, with which Mitchell did not cooperate, deemed Mitchell to be unchanged – and therefore incompetent. Three years passed, and the case was contemplated for dismissal in state court when federal prosecutors asked Dr. Welner to study the matter to a definitive end. He filed a 206-page report detailing extensive new information uncovered in his evaluation, and testified to his conclusions that Mitchell was competent. At a 2010 hearing, Justice Dale Kimball ruled Mitchell was competent to proceed. The case proceeded to trial, where Dr. Welner testified that Mitchell was a pedophile, a sadist, personality disordered, and not legally insane. His testimony drew particular attention to cognitive distortions as they differ from delusions, and culture-specific beliefs of fundamentalist LDS adherents. Mitchell was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The defense waived its right to appeal.  State vs. Byran Uyesugi - Mass murder  Byran Uyesugi, a forty-year-old Xerox service technician, killed seven of his co-workers on November 2, 1999 in the worst mass murder case in the history of Hawaii. Uyesugi began working for Xerox in 1984. He began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen, who had great difficulty placating his anger. Coworkers told Welner, who interviewed family, friends, neighbors, co- workers, and Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly speaking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he ever to be fired. In the period leading up to the shooting, Xerox management increasingly committed to phasing out the copier that Uyesugi had been servicing. He resisted learning the new machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi's manager insisted on November 1, 1999 that he would begin training the next day. Instead, Uyesugi came to work the next day and shot his colleagues dead, narrowly missing an eighth victim, after calmly waiting by the water fountain, with \\"butterflies in his stomach,\\" he later told Welner, as he contemplated the shooting before going through with it. Uyesugi pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, \\"He knew what he was doing was wrong, and he simply did not care. The jury found him sane and guilty of seven murders and one attempted murder after only 75 minutes of deliberation. He received a sentence of life without chance of parole. In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi's conviction. Dr. Welner has consulted to courts or examined perpetrators on numerous mass shooting and attempted mass shooting cases, including Colorado's James Holmes, NBC gunman William Tager, corrections officer George Banks, who killed 13, Tavares Calloway, and bias-hatred mass shooters Richard Baumhammers, Ronald Taylor, and Ronald Crumpley.  State of Alabama vs. Harvey Updyke – Sports and culture  Harvey Updyke, a fanatic of Alabama Crimson Tide football, was charged with poisoning the iconic trees at Auburn University's Toomer's Corner in 2011. Updyke's actions, which inspired an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary film, became a symbol of the intensity of the Alabama-Auburn football rivalry. At the same time, Updyke continued to exhibit bizarre behavior after his original arrest. The case reflected on the forensic psychiatric significance of fans' response to emotional defeats, as evidenced by the Auburn defeat of Alabama in November 2010, and the social culture of spectator sports message boards. Prosecutors consulted Welner to review the Updyke history and appraise the boundaries of sports fanaticism vs. mental illness, assess his mental state and criminal responsibility. Updyke pleaded guilty prior to trial. Welner also engaged mental health issues unique to the culture of professional sports as the forensic psychiatry examiner in the manslaughter trial of former NBA star Jayson Williams, and the death investigation of wrestling champion Chris Benoit.  State of Texas vs. Andrea Yates - Insanity and child killing  Andrea Yates was prosecuted by the State of Texas for the murder of her five children. She claimed legal insanity as a defense at trial for the murder of three of her children. In 2002, Yates was convicted of murder, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. In 2005, the conviction was overturned because the prosecution witness, Park Dietz, falsely testified that Yates' behavior and defense was identical to an earlier episode of Law & Order. There was no such episode. In anticipation of the 2006 retrial for the drowning of her five children, prosecutors asked Welner to assess her diagnosis and Yates' appreciation of the wrong of killing her children at the time of the crime, the criteria for legal insanity. In the videotaped interview with Welner, Yates admitted that she had actually determined to kill the children two months earlier and at a time of relative stability, and was waiting for her first occasion to be alone with them. She knew she would otherwise be stopped. Welner diagnosed Yates with psychotic depression, but concluded that she elected to kill her children because she was overwhelmed, timed with the departure of her mother-in-law that left her as sole caregiver of her five children. Welner also discovered that Andrea Yates locked up the family dog, which was usually free to run around in the house, before drowning the children. Welner included this as one of 68 examples of Yates' appreciation of the wrong of killing her children at the time it happened. With Welner's examination still ongoing, prosecutors called Deitz at the second trial to testify once again that Yates appreciated that her actions were wrong; Dietz also testified that Yates was not grossly psychotic. Welner later testified that while Yates was psychotic, she appreciated the wrong of her actions. The presiding judge neither allowed the jury access to Welner's 124-page report, nor allowed him to testify to the contents of his interviews of 23 witnesses, including Ms. Yates' husband. Prosecutors did not show Welner's 14-hour interview to the jury, nor introduce psychological testing evidence showing her lack of remorse. The jury, which had been culled from a group that was already familiar with heavy news reporting in the earlier trial and without individual voir dire for their feelings about the case, found Yates not guilty by reason of insanity. In the aftermath, Yates jurors who later acknowledged personal experiences with mental illness championed the verdict as a landmark. Foreman Todd Frank offered the verdict also conveyed a message to society. \\"Don't let this happen again. Do what you've got to do with the legislation, with insurance companies,\\" Frank said.\\" Welner has in turn cautioned that overwhelmed, ill or drug addicted mothers who previously contemplate the killing their children as unthinkable would look to Andrea Yates' being sent to a hospital and consider child homicide as an option, adding of filicide, \\"nobody speaks for the children.\\" Dr. Welner has been the principal examiner in a number of other notable insanity defense cases and others involving child killing within the family, including John Alan Rubio.  State of Louisiana vs. Damon Thibodeaux - Disputed confessions  Damon Thibodeaux confessed in 1996 to raping and murdering a cousin, Crystal Champagne. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Although appeals upheld the verdict, defense attorneys raised numerous points to the Jefferson Parish District Attorney to argue that Thibodeaux was innocent. No DNA evidence was dispositive and no other perpetrator had been identified beyond speculation. Given the importance of Thibodeaux' confession to the evidence against Thibodeaux, District Attorney Paul Connick asked Welner to review the available evidence, the circumstances of the interrogation and the setting in which it occurred, as well as Thibodeaux' vulnerabilities, to inform their decision-making about the case. Dr. Welner also conducted a videotaped interview of Thibodeaux, in a case that featured considerable cooperation by prosecution and defense with his protocol. Welner concluded the confession was false because physical findings grossly contradicted Thibodeaux' statements. He issued a 53-page opinion addressing the causes and factors leading to the false confession. These included the defendant's profound guilt over the fate of his cousin, being confronted with his failed polygraph, and police convincing him that what Thibodeaux himself conceded were false statements in the interrogation clinched his guilt and made continuing denials hopeless. Informed of Dr. Welner's conclusions, the District Attorney moved to vacate the confession and Thibodeaux was released. The murder of Crystal Champagne remains under investigation. Welner has examined numerous other notable and cited disputed confession cases in North American courts, including the killer of New York Socialite Linda Stein and the Albuquerque murder investigation of Victoria Martens.  State of Kansas vs. Cheever - Death penalty  Scott Cheever was arrested for the shooting death of Sheriff Matthew Samuels at a rural methamphetamine lab. When defense attorneys raised the prospect of a psychiatric defense, federal prosecutors retained Welner to examine criminal responsibility claims, ranging from psychiatric diagnoses to the effects of methamphetamine. Welner's review of the case included a videotaped interview of the defendant, in which they discussed the events of the crime, his movements before and during the shooting of Samuels, and what was influencing his decisions. Defense attorneys at trial instead offered a defense of methamphetamine intoxication. Welner, whose own inquiry had studied what Cheever took, when he took it, and amphetamine's effects on his behavior, and testified in rebuttal that Cheever was making decisions and controlling his actions from moment to moment before the crime, despite having used methamphetamine a short time earlier. Cheever was convicted and eventually sentenced to death. The Kansas Supreme Court reversed the verdict, and ruled that the trial court erred in permitting prosecutors to call Welner as a witness because an intoxication defense was not a mental health defense. In the court's opinion, the error required a new trial because Welner's testimony included a detailed accounting of Cheever's actions in his own words, and was, \\"extensive and devastating.\\" In a rare outcome, The United States Supreme Court then unanimously reversed the Kansas Supreme Court, ruling that an intoxication defense, when raised by a defendant, waived a Fifth Amendment protection, that prosecutors had a right to call Welner in rebuttal, and reinstated the verdict and death sentence. In addition to Cheever, Dr. Welner has examined defendants and/or testified in numerous other notable or court cited death penalty cases, including Alfonso Rodriguez and the Angola 5, and cases involving methamphetamine and other drugs and medicines that affect behavior.  U.S. vs. Omar Khadr - Terrorism and War  Khadr, a fifteen- year-old Canadian expatriate living in Afghanistan, was charged with the killing of U.S. Army medic Christopher Speer at an al-Qaeda safe house in Khost. Khadr was captured by American forces on July 27, 2002 and held first in Bagram, Afghanistan and then at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He was prosecuted through a U.S. military tribunal. The Department of Defense engaged Welner to examine claims by Khadr that his confessions were coerced, or alternatively, that he was too immature to withstand interrogation. Welner was also asked to assess issues of criminal responsibility. Welner reviewed the available interrogations and secured access to intelligence sources and Khadr's classified file. He interviewed guards, interrogators, medical personnel, Guantanamo camp commanders, intelligence data analysts, and then, Khadr himself. Welner concluded Khadr's confessions were the product of his being confronted with later-recovered video of his assembling bombs, and video of his asserting that he wanted to kill many Americans. Welner's inquiry also led him to repudiate defense claims that Khadr had been tortured. He came to the impression of Khadr as worldly beyond his years, from the range of his travel and interactions to experiences with other languages and translating al-Qaeda meetings for his father, to evasion techniques he manifested in interrogations with senior intelligence personnel. After a lengthy proceeding, Judge Patrick Parrish admitted Omar Khadr's confessions into evidence, ruling, \\"there isn't credible evidence the accused was ever tortured…even using a liberal interpretation considering the accused's age.\\" Military prosecutors also asked Welner to assess Mr. Khadr's likelihood of recidivism into radical jihadism upon release, for presentation at a sentencing hearing. Welner based his assessment on clinical data, research on deradicalization programs, research on incarcerated Muslim youth, and statistics of recidivism of Guantanamo detainees. At the sentencing proceeding, Welner testified that Mr. Khadr was a high risk of recidivism into dangerous jihadist activities, although he did not expect him to be directly violent. Factors contributing to Welner's opinion included Khadr's continued strong enmeshment with his jihadist family and its legacy, the international and financial infrastructure available to him, his stature among other detainees, among other factors. Referencing Mr. Khadr's evolution at Guantanamo, Welner's testimony noted that then 24-year-old Khadr had been \\"marinating in jihad,\\" and how the deputy camp commander characterized him as a \\"rock star\\" to other inmates who engaged him to lead them. The jury sentenced Khadr to 40 years in prison, though preempted by a pre-existing plea bargain, he was to serve no more than eight additional years at either Guantanamo Bay or in a Canadian prison. A defense appeal directed at Welner's testimony was summarily dismissed. In March 2011, Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews wrote to U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, asserting that Canada would need to review the sealed tape of Welner's interview in order to consider repatriating Khadr. After reviewing the interviews, Canada repatriated Khadr on September 29, 2012 under heavy pressure from the United States government. However, Canada echoed Welner's previously stated concerns about the nature of Khadr's dangerousness and placed him in a maximum security facility. In October 2013, Khadr's prison transfer application, considered independently of Welner's involvement, was denied. Over the objections of the Canadian government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a judge released Khadr to the community in 2015.  The Forensic Panel  Welner is the founder and chairman of The Forensic Panel, a multi-specialty forensic practice which employs peer-review of its forensic consultation. The objective of peer review, pursuant to the protocols established by The Forensic Panel, is intended to minimize examiner bias by subjecting forensic assessment to the formal evaluation and scrutiny of peers, who critique the diligence, objectivity, and adherence to standards of the work. The Forensic Panel is composed of over thirty practitioner members who provide forensic consultation in psychiatry, psychology, neuroradiology, emergency and critical care medicine, nursing, toxicology, and pathology.  The Depravity Standard and other research   Depravity Standard/Depravity Scale  Welner has pioneered research to operationalize an evidence-based approach for courts and juries charged with defining \\"heinous\\", \\"depraved\\", and \\"evil\\" crimes in sentencing determinations. The Depravity Standard contains twenty-five components of intent, actions, victimology, and attitudes associated with criminal offenses. The goal of the research is to promote an emphasis on gathering evidence as opposed to relying on impressionistic arguments, and to establish a methodology that prevents bias based on race, diagnosis, prognosis, or history, socioeconomics, or other personal factors. The application of the Depravity Standard distinguishes particular crimes by their severity relative to other comparable crimes. For example, the Depravity Standard's application will enable the distinction of the worst of murder relative to other murders, the worst of assault relative to other assaults, and the worst of white collar crimes and thefts relative to comparable crimes. The Depravity Standard is an inventory of evidence relating to the different stages of a crime – before, during, and after. The Depravity Scale, an internet-based series of surveys and a component of the Depravity Standard research, has established public consensus for what aspects of a crime are most heinous. The Depravity Standard, informed in part by this data, by higher court decisions, and by evidence from adjudicated cases, is not a psychological evaluation or test. Rather, it is an inventory to guide inexperienced jurors on what qualities of a crime may distinguish its severity if they believe them to be present.  CIEEO (Clinical Inventory of the Everyday Extreme and Outrageous)  The Depravity Standard research has inspired Dr. Welner's research into the CIEEO (Clinical Inventory of the Everyday Extreme and Outrageous), a 14-item inventory of non-criminal everyday evil reflecting a range of an actor's intent and effects on a victim. Unlike the Depravity Standard, the CIEEO is being developed to apply in clinical and screening settings to flag behaviors that warrant treatment or other intervention in order to prevent consequences at home, workplace, or community. The CIEEO is inspired by the goals of vigilance for child abuse – namely, detection and identification being the first step toward intervention and treatment of the worst of behaviors.  Perpetrators of drug-facilitated sex assault  Welner researched and developed the typology for classifying drug-facilitated sex assaulters. Such offenders are distinguished by setting, be it workplace, in social interactions, or doctors. The offenders found in each of these separate settings exhibit particular qualities.  Public policy  Welner was a key contributor a range of proposals within landmark mental health reform legislation that passed the United States Congress in 2016. He testified to lawmakers on multiple occasions prior to the bill's eventual passage. Apart from advocating various ideas to expand crisis mental health services and to attract talent to treat the underserved, Welner also argued for the reform of commitment law, and reform of HIPAA, as a means to prevent both suicide and homicide outcomes. Welner was under serious consideration by the Trump Administration as Assistant Secretary of Mental Health in the Department of Health and Human Services, a position created to direct mental health and substance abuse policy in the United States. Among his writings, Welner had long advocated for upgrading the integrity of forensic mental health through the videotaping of forensic psychiatry interviews, transparent exchange of notes, and peer review. His efforts to mandate videotaping of forensic mental health interviews resulted in laws passed in Illinois and Colorado. In 1992 and 1993, Welner was a media coordinator and spokesperson for the Ross Perot presidential election campaign in New York and the citizen action organization United We Stand America, also in New York. During the 1992 election campaign, Welner debated in support of Perot against other candidates' representatives.  Media consultation, writings, and commentary  Welner has been a contributor to numerous major network news programs. He was a forensic science consultant to ABC News' Law and Justice unit, and familiar to many viewers in particular of Good Morning America and 20/20. He has otherwise been a regular contributor to CNN, Fox News, Larry King Live, Bill Bennett's Morning in America, and the Dr. Oz Show, on issues relating to forensic psychiatry and forensic science.  Personal and professional background  Welner is the youngest of four children. Both his parents were born in Poland and lost their families in the Holocaust. His father Nick was civil engineer; his mother Barbara, who dropped out of school as a wartime refugee, entered nursing school in Britain unable to speak English and finished as valedictorian, going on to specialize in gerontology. Dr. Welner lost both of his sisters in accidental deaths. Dr. Welner's oldest sister, Sandra Welner, M.D. was a Maryland-based gynecologist who fought through severe neurological disabilities suffered in a stroke to become internationally renowned for her medical research and advocacy for the medical care of the disabled before her untimely death in 2001. Michael Welner graduated high school at the age of 15, then attended the University of Miami, where he earned a B.S. in Biology, before moving on to the University of Miami School of Medicine. While an undergraduate and medical student, he announced radio play-by-play for the University of Miami Hurricanes baseball and football teams - he would later credit game announcing as his best training for future success as a testifying expert witness. He has maintained a clinical practice since 1992, specializing in patients who have difficulty responding to treatment, and has been Board Certified in Psychiatry, Forensic Psychiatry, Psychopharmacology and Disaster Medicine. He is married to Orli Welner, a corporate attorney.

The company's primary product is pickled cucumbers, but it is also a large supplier of pepper, mixed pickle, relish, and other pickled products. Mt. Olive is the largest independent pickle company in the United States and the top-selling pickle brand in the Southeastern United States, where its market share approaches 70 percent.Mohan, \\"Mt. Olive Packs and Prints Pickles and Peppers,\\" Packaging Digest, September 2005. Facilities are all located in Mt. Olive on with of production, office, and warehouse space. The company has in excess of 1,200 brining vats and can store over of cucumbers. The company employs over 500 people which swells to over 800 during the busiest intake season each summer. In 1943, the company was one of the first in the country to offer profit sharing plans to their employees. In 1959, Mt. Olive established an employee community fund that helped support local community organizations. The Mt. Olive community fund also awards scholarships to employees' children. Each school year the company's community fund awards four scholarships for four different students at $1,500 each. History In the mid-1920s, Shikrey Baddour, a Lebanese immigrant from nearby Goldsboro, first saw opportunity in the wasted cucumber crops of area farmers. Baddour came up with the idea of buying the cucumbers, putting them in a brining tank, and selling the brined cucumbers, or brine stock, to other pickle firms. Baddour enlisted the aid of George Moore, a sailor from Wilmington who had worked in a Castle Hayne pickle plant. The plan didn't work the way they had envisioned, however: they had no buyers for their product. By January 1926, a new plan was put into place through the efforts of a group of Mount Olive business people, led by Headley Morris Cox, who formally established the Mt. Olive Pickle Company, Inc. to pack and sell its own pickles. Thirty-seven original shareholders put forward $19,000 in capital to get the company started in what all viewed as a \\"community proposition.\\" Many of today's stockholders are grandchildren and great grandchildren of the charter stockholders. The board of directors hired H.M. Cox as President, Moore as factory superintendent and Baddour as salesman and gave them each shares of stock for their initial investments. The board also purchased of land from farmer J.A. Westbrook for $1,000. The land is part of the current manufacturing site today. Westbrook's home still stands across from the plant. Mt. Olive surpassed $500,000 in sales in 1942. The company initiated a profit-sharing plan in 1943 and by 1947 its sales reached more than $1 million a year.Growing An American Tradition, Mt. Olive Pickle Co., 2006. In 1973, Mt. Olive food scientists, working in cooperation with researchers from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), discovered one of the secrets of fermentation. The Mt. Olive and USDA researchers discovered that the bacteria L. plantarum was key to the fermentation process, and that purging carbon dioxide from brine with nitrogen led to minimal rot and waste.Etchells, et al., \\"Factors Influencing Bloater Formation in Brined Cucumbers During Controlled Fermentation,\\" Journal of Food Science, 1975. In 1986, Mt. Olive Pickle co-founded the North Carolina Pickle Festival.\\"Thousands Turn Out for N.C. Pickle Festival,\\" Goldsboro News-Argus, April 29, 2007. In 2005, the Mt. Olive plant had expanded to take up more than of production space covering . In 2008, the company introduced the first single-pack pickles. The intended markets are workers and schoolchildren. Pickle drop 2012 pickle drop On December 31, 1999, the Mt. Olive Pickle Company held the first New Year's Eve \\"pickle drop\\", in which a glowing green -high pickle is lowered on a flagpole at 7 o'clock EST (midnight Greenwich Mean Time). Guests are provided with hats, noisemakers, and refreshments including cookies, hot chocolate and pickles. The event has turned into an annual occurrence and a source of pride for the community and also benefits the Food Bank of North Carolina through donations of canned goods from guests. The Pickle Drop had its 20th anniversary on December 31, 2019. Controversy In October 1998, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), a trade union, announced a boycott of Mt. Olive Pickle Company. The union targeted the pickle processor because it believed that growers would not raise wages unless Mount Olive agreed to pay more for growers' cucumbers.Lecker, \\"Major Pickle Firm Faces FLOC Boycott in March,\\" Toledo Blade, October 11, 1998; Zagier, \\"Pickle Protest Planned,\\" Charlotte News and Observer, October 11, 1998; Carmen, \\"Organizer of Union for Migrant Workers Takes on Pickle Giant,\\" Columbus Dispatch, January 24, 1999; Sengupta, \\"Farm Union Takes Aim at a Big Pickle Maker,\\" New York Times, October 26, 2000. The union's five-year boycott of Mt. Olive Pickle was ultimately successful. In September 2004, FLOC signed a collective bargaining agreement with Mt. Olive and the growers. More than 6,000 of the state's 10,000 guest workers joined FLOC. More than 1,000 growers agreed to form the North Carolina Growers Association to act as the employers' collective bargaining agent. The Association covered a number of cash crops, such as Christmas trees and tobacco, in addition to cucumbers.Franklin, \\"Farm Workers' Group Pushes for Better Pay, Rights,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 8, 2006; Greenhouse, \\"North Carolina Growers' Group Signs Union Contract for Mexican Workers,\\" New York Times, September 17, 2004. In February 2017, according to a consent agreement, the EPA fined the Mt. Olive Pickle Company $131,856 for violating the Clean Water Act over a quarter-century. Mt.

It appears in the collection The Book of Sand. Synopsis The story deals with a woodcutter who lives in the midst of a deep wood in old England and who has never seen the sea. He tells the reader of the time a man appeared at his door and asked for lodging. The woodcutter notes that the man was elderly, the visitor referring to England as \\"Saxony\\" which usage at the time was a sign of age. The next day the visitor wishes to leave. Before he does, he claims that he is a King and is descended from Odin. He tells the woodcutter that he is exiled, but that he will always be a king because he holds the Disk of Odin. The visitor claims the Disk of Odin is the sole thing in the world that has but one side. The visitor opens his hand and \\"shows\\" the disk. The woodcutter sees only an empty palm but when he touches it he feels a chill in his fingers and sees a flash. He lies that he has a full chest of gold and wants to trade it for the disk, but the visitor declines. When the visitor turns to leave, the woodcutter kills him with an axe. The woodcutter drags the visitor's body and throws it into the river. He then comes back and searches for the disk, which he never finds.

The program is a part of Sunset International Bible Institute (SIBI) in Lubbock, Texas. Those accepted into the program spend eight months in studying and training at SIBI before being sent to mission fields around the world for a period of 14 to 22 months.  History  In October 1973, sixteen young people came to Sunset International Bible Institute, which was called \\"Sunset School of Preaching\\" at the time, to be trained in Christian evangelism and mission work. These first students went as a team to Dublin, Ireland for their field service time. \\"Sunset School of Preaching\\" (SSOP) is what brought AIM alive. Cline Paden started SSOP (now known as Sunset International Bible Institute, SIBI) in 1962 soon after he completed missionary work. The school's purpose in the beginning was to teach motivated Spanish-speaking individuals to preach. Because of this, the school was named, \\"Latin American Bible School\\". After a period of time, the organization shifted its purpose to evangelism. Owing to the number of people joining the organization and the change of purpose, \\"Latin American Bible School\\" finally changed its name to \\"Adventures In Missions\\". In 1993 Cline Paden retired and the president position was passed to Truitt Adair. Truitt Adair has been president ever since and has continued the success of AIM.  Program  Adventures In Missions operates on a schedule in which one new class of students is accepted and begins training each year. Young people interested in joining the AIM program must apply in advance. Applications are normally accepted starting in January for the class that begins in August of each year. Accepted students move to Lubbock in August, where they are given an orientation and begin classes at SIBI. In addition to classroom study, the eight months of training in Lubbock also includes mentoring by AIM staff, opportunities for practical application outside of the classroom, weekly experience serving among area congregations, and occasional class trips for recruiting, equipping, and mission evangelism. Starting about a month after classes begin each year, students are given presentations by visiting missionaries who desire to recruit teams from the class of students. The number of missionaries who recruit from a given class varies from year to year, but is typically between fifteen and twenty. Missionaries on fields both outside of and within the United States recruit from each year's AIM class. Following a time of prayer and reflection, each student is asked to submit his or her preferences about both the fields he or she would like to work on, as well as classmates that he or she would like to work on a team with. AIM staff members gather these preferences together and then spend over a month in prayer and collaboration forming the class into teams for specific mission fields. In April, after the eight months of classes and training in Lubbock, the students are sent out as teams to their designated mission points around the world. During this field service time, AIM students work with experienced missionaries to spread the message of Christianity, teach children's classes, organize youth activities, serve the church, and work in humanitarian efforts. To fulfill graduation requirements, AIM requires that each student have a minimum stay of 14 months on his or her field, though many students choose to stay longer—up to 22 months or more, depending on their individual preferences.  Purpose  AIM describes its purpose as spreading the knowledge of God and the Bible to others through missionary activities.  Numbers  AIM has trained over 1600 students, over 1000 of whom have been sent to the mission field. In 2007, AIM stated that it had sent teams to a total of 170 mission points (100 mission points in 46 foreign countries and 70 mission points in 29 states). The average number of students accepted per year from 1973 through 2003 is 49, and from 2003-2006 it was 59. The 2006 class began with 62 young adults.  AIM Alumni  In 2009, former AIM students started the AIM Alumni Association on Facebook. Shortly after, the AIM Alumni Association began weekly blogging as a way to encourage and challenge their peers.  AIM Staff  In 2017, Cory Burns replaces Kris Smith as director of Adventures in Missions, Smith serving as director for 17 years, both former \\"AIMers.\\" Previous AIM directors include Jay Jarboe, Rex Boyles and Don Solomon. Burns travels everywhere that the students travel and makes sure that the students are on top of their studies. The Aim Advancement Coordinator is Pat Sheaffer, who is also an AIM alumni. Pat helps make the decisions on where to take the students and what they will be involved in. AIM would not be the same without him as he helps the students get to their destination. Pat also goes around the nation in order to recruit other students for the next year to come. The rest of the team consists of Robby Stephens and Barb Smith. Robby Stephens is the Staff Coordinator who helps make the events happen wherever the students go. If there were to be any questions, then the person who would have the answer would be Barb Smith---the receptionist in the AIM office, located at Sunset Church of Christ.

Personal history Monck was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts to a mother from Nutley, New Jersey and a father from Liverpool, England. He acquired the nickname \\"Chip\\" at a summer camp on Lake Winnipesaukee, in New Hampshire. While Monck went to the South Kent School on scholarships for ice hockey and crew, he became more interested in welding and machinery, designing a potato harvester that he sold to McCormick. He began volunteering with a summer theater group at Wellesley College, learning the basics of theatrical lighting from Greg Harney. He began auditing classes at Harvard while working with the university's theater company. Early career Monck began working at the Greenwich Village nightclub The Village Gate in 1959, lighting comedians and jazz and folk artists, and living in the basement apartment under the club where Bob Dylan eventually wrote \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" on Monck's IBM Selectric typewriter. He began extensive relationships with both the Newport Folk Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival, lasting eight and nine years, respectively, while continuing to work at the Gate. He became friends with Charles Altman of the Altman Lighting Co., repairing equipment and borrowing lighting instruments to improve the stage lighting of the Gate. He began lighting the stage of the Apollo Theater in Harlem. In 1967, he lit the Monterey Pop Festival, which featured the first major American appearances by Jimi Hendrix and The Who, as well as the first major public performances of Janis Joplin. Monck's work can be seen in the D. A. Pennebaker film Monterey Pop. That year, he also lit The Byrds at the Hollywood Bowl and his first Rolling Stones concert. The following year, he designed the distinctive half-shell stage at the Miami Pop Festival (December 1968), called the Flying Stage, that was one of the festival's two, simultaneously operating main stages. In 1969 he worked with Crosby, Stills and Nash in Europe, and began working with concert impresario Bill Graham, renovating the Fillmore theaters. Woodstock In 1969 he lit the concert that would define his career and make him a public figure. Monck was hired to plan and build the staging and lighting for the Woodstock Music & Art Fair's \\"Aquarian Exposition\\" music festival. Paid $7,000 for ten weeks of work, much of his plan had to be scrapped when the promoters were not allowed to use the original location in Wallkill, New York. The stage roof that was constructed in the shorter time available was not able to support the lighting that had been rented, which wound up sitting unused underneath the stage. The only light on the stage was from spotlights. Just before the concert started, Monck was drafted as the master of ceremonies when Michael Lang noticed that they had forgotten to hire one. He can be heard (and seen) in recordings of Woodstock making the stage announcements, including requests to \\"stay off the towers\\" and the warning about the \\"brown acid\\". The Rolling Stones Four months after Woodstock, Monck and Lang planned the Altamont Free Concert for the Rolling Stones, which also had to move from the original planned location, but this time with unfortunate consequences. Members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were hired to provide security for the concert with terrible results. Monck confronted a member of the Angels stealing a large custom carpet that was part of the Rolling Stones stage set and lost teeth being hit in the mouth with a pool cue. He later tracked down the person and managed to trade a case of brandy for the carpet. Monck used an innovative method of stage lighting for the 1972 tour, which was designed for him by Michael Callahan, a NYC high school student interested in concert lighting. Callahan devised the Mirror Followspot System after Monck complained about the inconsistency in how close followspots were to the stage as the distance varied from arena to arena. Instead of raising 3,000 pounds of lamps to overhead trusses, Monck had built from Callahan's drawings a 40' x 8' array of Mylar mirrors. A row of spotlights sitting on the floor behind the stage bounced light off the mirrors onto the stage. Later career In 1974, Monck was the host of Speakeasy, a short-lived rock and roll talk show that featured mostly chat and some live performances by such acts as Tom Waits, Frank Zappa and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Monck's persona was well-known enough to be parodied as \\"Chick Monk\\" on SCTV by Tony Rosato as a marriage counselor employing strobe lights and a fog machine. Also in 1974, he provided production services for the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman boxing match The Rumble in the Jungle, and the associated three-day music festival Zaire 74, which featured performances by James Brown, Celia Cruz and the Fania All- Stars, B.B. King, Miriam Makeba, The Spinners, Bill Withers, and Manu Dibango. Monck's work can be seen in the films Soul Power and When We Were Kings. He was the lighting designer for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as consulting on the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In 2003, Monck received the Parnelli Award for Lifetime Achievement in the concert touring industry. As of 2011, Monck resides in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Australia concentrating on corporate and retail lighting. In 2011, he served as the Director of Production of the One Great Night On Earth Festival, planned for December 1, 2012. This event was intended to raise funds to help Australians in regions devastated by natural disasters like the Black Saturday bushfires, flooding and drought.

He is known to Wrigley Field visitors for his idiosyncratic cheers at baseball games, generally punctuated with an exclamatory \\"Woo!\\" (e.g., \\"Cubs, woo! Cubs, woo! Big-Z, woo! Zambrano, woo! Cubs, woo!\\") Longtime Cubs announcer Harry Caray dubbed Wickers \\"Leather Lungs\\" for his ability to shout for hours at a time. Wickers grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Born premature and abused by his mother, he was raised by his grandmother, who brought him to his first Chicago Cubs games during the late 1940s. Wickers explained in a 2004 Chicago Tribune interview that he started \\"wooing\\" in 1958 or 1959. \\"It just came to be. I had fun with it,\\" he remarked. He has remained a fixture at Wrigley Field ever since, even singing \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" during a May 24, 2001 game. In 2005, filmmaker Paul Hoffman released a documentary film about Wickers, called WooLife. The film premiered at the Chicago Historical Society. Wickers worked nights as a custodian at Northwestern University for much of his life. After the deaths of both his grandmother and girlfriend in the 1980s, a distraught Wickers found himself homeless and without a stable job. From 1984 to 1990, he attended Cubs games with donated tickets. Wickers was absent at Wrigley Field games for a brief period in 1987, which prompted some Cubs fans to worry that he had died. He eventually contacted news organizations to say that he was alive and well. Since 1990, most of Wickers' income has come from washing windows in the neighborhood around Wrigley Field. He also makes paid appearances at parties and has starred in local commercials. In 2000, Chicago entertainer Erich “ Mancow” Mueller bought Woo Woo a set of dentures to improve his superfan appearance. Mancow spoke about this daily and had Woo Woo in the office and on the air at Q101 many times. Wickers was treated and released from Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical center after being hit by a car after a Cubs game on April 18, 2005. He has since recovered. A minor controversy occurred after April 19, 2017, when Wickers was ejected from a Cubs game for not having a ticket. Wickers said that he had an electronic ticket, on the phone of a friend. According to Cubs management, the friend became verbally abusive when asked to produce the e-ticket, and the two were escorted out of Wrigley Field. Subsequently, Wickers attended a number of Cubs games without further incident. As of 2019, Ronnie is still attending Cubs games, taking pictures with fans and tourists alike.

Their work was known for grotesquerie, surrealism and complete uninvolvement with New York art world trends. Critic Ken Johnson referred to Chicago Imagism as \\"the postwar tradition of fantasy-based art making.\\"Ken Johnson, \\"ART IN REVIEW; Ray Yoshida,\\" The New York Times, September 17, 1999 Senior Chicago magazine editor Christine Newman said, \\"Even with the Beatles and the Vietnam War in the forefront, the artists made their own way, staking out their time, their place, and their work as an unforgettable happening in art history.\\" Gender was not an issue; the Imagists had an unusually high proportion of female artists. There are three distinct groups which, outside of Chicago, are indiscriminately bundled together as Imagists: The Monster Roster, The Hairy Who, and The Chicago Imagists. The Monster Roster The Monster Roster was a group of Chicago artists, several of whom served in World War II and were able to go to art school thanks to the G.I. Bill. They were given their name in 1959 by critic and Monster Roster member, Franz Schulze. The name was based on their existential, sometimes gruesome, semi-mystical figurative work.Richard Vine, \\"Where the Wild Things Were\\", Art in America, May 1997, pp. 98-111. Many of them were mentored by Vera Berdich, an influential surrealist printmaker who taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.Garret Holg, \\"Art of the City: The Imagists -- and Beyond\\" Chicago Sun-Times, Sunday, March 22, 1998, Section B, pp. 1, 14 The group was recognized in a major exhibition at the Smart Museum of Art at University of Chicago, which examined its history and impact on the development of American art.Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago.

C. Westermann The Hairy Who \\"Neither a movement nor a style, Hairy Who was simply the name six Chicago artists chose when they decided to join forces and exhibit together in the mid-1960s.\\" The Hairy Who was a \\"group\\" made up of six School of the Art Institute graduates, mentored by Ray YoshidaLarry Finley, \\"Influential Figure in Chicago Art World: Teacher, Mentor to Artists in Imagism School of 1970s\\", Chicago Sun-Times, Monday, January 19, 2009 and Whitney Halstead.: Jim Falconer, Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Karl Wirsum, and Suellen Rocca. They developed a vibrant and vulgar approach to art making- and after only six exhibitions together: three at the Hyde Park Art Center (in '66, '67, and '68), and three out of town, at the San Francisco Art Institute ('68), the School of Visual Art in New York ('69), and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in DC ('69), they decided to break up and continued on working on their own individual practices, and/or joined other groups. In 1964, Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson and Jim Falconer approached the Hyde Park Art Center's exhibitions director, Don Baum (a key figure in the Hairy Who's success), with the idea of a group show consisting of the three of them, and Art Green and Suellen Rocca. Baum agreed, and also suggested they include Karl Wirsum. The six artists, held exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966, 1967, and 1968. They named the exhibitions \\"Hairy Who?\\" but never intended to organize themselves together as a unified group. The Hairy Who's paintings were not only inspired by the commercial culture (advertisements, comics, posters, and sales catalogs) found on Chicago's streets but like many Americans of their time, their work came to be during a moment of radical conflict, the war in Vietnam, student-lead protests, counterculture, turbulent gender and racial relations, and the rapid extension of a capitalist consumer economy.Extremely acidic color choices outlined with thick black outlines, jazzy and psychedelic patterns with an adolescent sense of humor pervade the Hairy Who’s paintings, drawings and sculptures. Across the spectrum of each individual styles it was impossible not to distinguish each individual artist from another, although they complement each other what brings them together is the prevalence of figuration, and a treatment of the human face and form that often verges on the grotesque or the cartoonish. Their sense of humor embraced idiosyncrasy and spontaneity with wordplay, puns, and inside jokes that often belied the transgressiveness of their subject matter. Ambiguous, provocative, but also strategic, their work transmitted progressive ideas that challenged prevailing notions of gender and sexuality, social mores and standards of beauty, and nostalgia and obsolescence.New York gallerist Derek Eller, who has represented Wirsum since 2010, says that Wirsum had next to no presence in the city before that time: his sense is that “the Imagists were always out of sync with New York taste and style”. In the 1960s and 1970s this meant the sternly reductivist forms of Minimalism or Conceptualism; when figuration entered the New York mainstream, through Pop, it was via the mediating filter of contemporary mass media. The Hairy Who, by contrast, were looking at an array of narrative and vernacular forms such as cartoons, tattoos, Outsider art (including the drawings of the self-taught Joseph Yoakum, who worked in Chicago) as well as the paintings and manuscripts of the Quattrocento, northern Renaissance painting, and traditional arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Pre-Columbian Americas. In their wide geographical and historical purview, they distanced themselves from the artistic vanguard (and its supporters) which tended to be fixated on its contemporary social and artistic moment. For the first exhibition they collaborated on an arresting poster depicting a man’s heavily tattooed back, each tattoo designed by a different member of the group. A collaborative comic, The Portable Hairy Who!, was made in place of a catalog and sold at the show for 50 cents a copy.It immediately gave rise to a second show the following year, and another in 1968. The first show was excitedly reviewed (with illustrations!) in Artforum by Professor Whitney Halstead of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), thus fulfilling the artists’ ambition to get their work to a wider audience. As a result, in 1968 Philip Linhares, the San Francisco Art Institute curator, offered them their first show outside Chicago. The next year, Walter Hopps, who had founded the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles and was at the time the Curator of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC, invited them to stage an exhibition. The naming of the exhibition was explained in an interview conducted by Dan Nadel with artist Jim Nutt: \\"At the time art show names were very cool, the less they said about the work the cooler (better). There had been a number of shows at MoMA… titled \\"Sixteen Americans\\" or \\"Thirteen Americans\\"... All of us were determined not to emulate such suave coolness, but didn't have a clue what would work. At our first get-together to discuss the show we were getting nowhere with this problem. This was also our first exposure to Karl in the flesh for the five of us. As frustration mounted from not solving the dilemma, group discussion disintegrated into smaller units, when Karl was heard saying plaintively, \\"Harry who? Who is this guy?\\" At which point some of us were hysterically incredulous that he didn't know about Harry Bouras, the exceptionally self-important artist who was the art critic for WFMT, the cultural FM station in Chicago. All of us found this very funny, including Karl, and as we bantered about variations of the situation, we realized the potential for the name, especially if we changed Harry to Hairy.\\"Dan Nadel, \\"Hairy Who's history of the Hairy Who.\\" The Ganzfeld 3. New York: Monday Morning, 2003. p. 121-2. \\"Nonetheless, there is an important distinction to be made between The Chicago Imagist and Hairy Who, says Thea Liberty Nichols, the Researcher of Prints and Drawings at the AIC, who co-organized “Hairy Who? 1966-1969” with Mark Pascale, the Curator of Prints and Drawings and Ann Goldstein, the Deputy Director and Chair, and Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art. “The Hairy Who was an artist-designed, artist-named exhibition group while Chicago Imagism was a label was applied to a whole gaggle of artists by an outside critic,” Nichols says.\\" The Hairy Who included: * Art Green * Gladys Nilsson * Jim Nutt * Jim Falconer * Suellen Rocca * Karl Wirsum The Chicago Imagists The Imagists were not a formal group, but rather a description of artists involved in shows curated by Baum in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. Several other artists, including Roger Brown, Ed Paschke, Barbara Rossi and Philip Hanson, are often incorrectly associated with the Hairy Who exhibitions, when in fact they showed at the Hyde Park Art Center between 1968-1971 in several other shows, such as \\"Non- Plussed Some\\", \\"False Image\\", \\"Chicago Antigua\\" and \\"Marriage Chicago Style\\". In addition to the Hairy Who, they included: * Roger Brown * Ed Paschke * Christina Ramberg * Philip Hanson * Barbara Rossi * Ed Flood * Irving Petlin * Sarah Canright * Richard Wetzel * Ray Yoshida * Errol Ortiz * Ronald Markman * Lynn Duenow In 1969 the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago exhibited many Imagists, including Yoshida, in a show entitled \\"Don Baum Says 'Chicago Needs Famous Artists'\\". Gallery owner Phyllis Kind gave Jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson their first solo shows in 1970, and Roger Brown his first such show in 1971. Distinction between Chicago Imagism and New York Pop Art Chicago private art dealer Karen Lennox said, \\"The Hairy Who sourced surrealism, Art Brut, and the comics.

It is a heavy low-viscosity liquid with refractive index 1.4808. It was invented for use in fire extinguishers by the Germans during the mid-1940s, in an attempt to create a less-toxic, more effective alternative to carbon tetrachloride. This was a concern in aircraft and tanks as carbon tetrachloride produced highly toxic by-products when discharged onto a fire. CBM was slightly less toxic, and used up until the late 1960s, being officially banned by the NFPA for use in fire extinguishers in 1969, as safer and more effective agents such as halon 1211 and 1301 were developed.

He got his start playing with Vic Amato, Andy Dennen and Al Lesert in the band Cirrus, in and around Grand Rapids, Michigan, playing many gigs in West Michigan before joining Ted Nugent in 1978.  Ted Nugent  Born in 1951 in Portland, Oregon, Huhn moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan at the age of four when he began his music career. He started with piano and voice lessons, and soon after taught himself the guitar. He began performing in rock bands in 1967, initially with Cirrus, composed of high school friends; in 1973, he performed in Tanglewood, a full-time successful mid-west bar band. In 1975, after graduating from Michigan State with a bachelor's degree in Social Sciences, he then played with longtime friend and drummer, Vic Amato for two and one half years, before auditioning for Ted Nugent. He came to prominence when he joined Ted Nugent's band in 1978. Huhn replaced band member Derek St. Holmes, and was thrust immediately into the spotlight. At the time Huhn joined Ted Nugent, it was one of the hottest acts in the world. Huhn handled lead vocals on the classic Nugent anthem \\"Weekend Warriors\\", and was also featured prominently on the album of the same name, which sold more than a million copies, going platinum within a week of release. Huhn remained with Ted Nugent's band until 1982, and recorded three studio albums and one live album during his tenure. Another live recording from a 1979 show at London's Hammersmith Odeon was later released in 1998. After leaving Ted Nugent, Huhn worked briefly with Irish guitar legend Gary Moore on his album Dirty Fingers, toured with Moore for some gigs in August 1982. He would leave to pursue an offer from Geffen Records to write songs with future Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin and to put a band together with bassist Mark Andes and drummer Frankie Banali. The group recorded demos but nothing came of it. His next job was frontman for the band Victory, a group based in Hannover, Germany. He recorded four releases as Victory's original lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter, and the band had minor success with their 1986 single \\"The Check's in the Mail\\". He left the group in early 1988 to play with Jerry Shirley and Humble Pie. He would also team up with former Alice Cooper band rhythm section Neal Smith and Dennis Dunaway and Blue Öyster Cult's Joe Bouchard in a project called Deadringer, resulting in the release of the album Electrocution of the Heart in 1989.  Humble Pie  In 1988 former Humble Pie and Fastway drummer Jerry Shirley organized a new version of Humble Pie in which he would be the group's leader and only original member. He hired Huhn as the group's lead singer, which worked quite well as the band's original vocalist Steve Marriott and Huhn had very similar vocal styles. Humble Pie Featuring Jerry Shirley was based in Cleveland, Ohio, where Shirley worked as a DJ at a classic rock radio station. Huhn and Shirley were the mainstays in the band, and together with numerous rotating musicians performed Humble Pie music regularly all over the United States for the next ten years. No official recordings with Huhn as the band's singer were ever released, although the group was broadcast live on special radio concerts on several occasions, and bootlegs of those performances do exist. During the latter part of the 1990s, Jerry Shirley developed a string of legal problems and moved back to his native England, taking the Humble Pie name with him. Huhn ended his longtime stint with Shirley in 1999. Between 1993 and 1995, Huhn fronted Michigan band No Mercy with Brownsville Station's Michael Lutz on bass, Ted Nugent, Blackfoot drummer Gunner Ross and Scotty Anderson on lead guitar. Huhn and Ross had also played together in the Detroit band The Almighty Strut in the early '80's.  Foghat  Huhn singing for Foghat at the 2007 Heritage Fest in Downers Grove, Illinois Since 2000, Huhn has been the lead vocalist for another classic rock act, Foghat. Original Foghat vocalist Dave Peverett died of cancer in 2000, and the band's remaining members wanted to continue performing. Huhn accepted the band's offer to join. Aside from his vocal duties, Huhn also plays guitar. Although Bryan Bassett (formerly of Wild Cherry and Molly Hatchet) handled most of the lead guitar work, Huhn provided steady rhythms and played some solos as well. Since joining Foghat, Huhn has recorded three studio releases, Family Joules (2002) and Last Train Home (2010), and Under the Influence (2016), and three live releases, Foghat Live II (2007), a double disc collection featuring the band's greatest hits, Live at the Blues Warehouse, originally a live session for DJ Mark Klein’s weekly ‘Long Island Blues Warehouse Radio Show,’ and a live show from the Under the Influence Tour, Live at the Bottoms Up. Huhn can also be seen on two DVD releases, 2005's Official Bootleg DVD - Vol. 1 (2002 - 2004), and Live in St. Pete, issued in December 2013. In 2003, he took part in a reunion with his former Victory bandmates. The result was the CD release Instinct. Huhn declined an offer to rejoin Victory as the band's permanent lead vocalist, and chose instead to continue his work with Foghat. He remains a vital part of Foghat. In 2007, he recorded an album with guitarist Matt Roehr, formerly of German superstars Böhse Onkelz.

Career KNXT Channel 2 After serving as a war correspondent in World War II and Korea, Roberts settled in the Los Angeles area and became a respected radio news reporter, eventually turning to television in the mid-1950s at KNXT Channel 2 (now KCBS- TV), the local CBS owned-and-operated station. He anchored a nightly newscast and occasionally ventured to far-flung locations to report on national and international stories, taking with him his own Bell and Howell movie camera with which he shot his own news footage. With him on KNXT's newscasts in that time were three other Los Angeles television stalwarts, anchor and reporter Bill Stout, weather forecaster Bill Keene and sports reporter Gil Stratton (who at the time also doubled as a radio, television and movie actor). KTLA Channel 5 Roberts left KNXT in 1959 and joined Los Angeles station KTLA Channel 5 as news director and primary anchor, along with news producer/director Julian Macdonald, virtually remaking that independent station's news operation. The newscast Roberts and Macdonald oversaw included such respected figures as Stout (who followed Roberts to KTLA in 1960), sports reporter and former football star Tom Harmon, and veteran reporter Stan Chambers (who retired on August 11, 2010 on his 87th birthday, marking 63 years as a reporter at KTLA). Roberts' signature conclusion to the early news broadcast was \\"I bid you a pleasant evening\\"; for the late news it was \\"I bid you goodnight.\\" \\"The Big News\\" In 1966, Roberts returned to KNXT, joining the station's highly esteemed 6 p.m. \\"The Big News\\" broadcast and its late-night companion \\"The Eleven O'Clock Report.\\" Roberts joined a staff that included anchor Jerry Dunphy, Maury Green, Ralph Story, Keene, and Stratton. Roberts contributed news and feature reports and anchored the weekend newscasts. Early in 1974 he once again left KNXT for KTLA and took over the station's hour-long 10 p.m. newscasts. After two years Roberts decided to step back from nightly television news and left KTLA; after a hiatus he joined then-PBS member television station KCET, contributing feature reports and commentaries. His long tenure in Los Angeles comprised reports and travels ranging from offbeat local stories to the war in Vietnam. According to the book Helter Skelter, the young son of a neighbor of Roberts found what turned out to be the .22 Buntline revolver wielded by Manson Family member Tex Watson the night of actress Sharon Tate's and her houseguests' murders, and it was turned over to the police. As details of the crime came out in the weeks that followed, the boy's father made several calls to the police, suggesting that the missing murder weapon was the same broken, long-barreled gun his son had found. Finally, fed up with months of being ignored by the LAPD, he asked Clete Roberts to intervene in December 1969. The book does not say whether the call from Roberts finally did the trick. Acting career Roberts also carried his polish and expertise onto the \\"silver screen\\" and television as well, most notably in select episodes of M*A*S*H, in which he played himself, a war correspondent. Roberts appeared as himself in the lengthy introduction to the crime syndicate expose film The Phenix City Story in 1955. He interviewed on camera several of the actual townspeople of Phenix City, Alabama, who had been witness to the events there in the 1930s, '40s and early '50s. Roberts portrayed reporters in various productions, among them Meteor from 1979 and the 1983 NBC miniseries V as well a San Francisco television newsman in the 1983 nuclear war film Testament.  Honors and awards  The Associated Press Television and Radio Association of California, Nevada, and Hawaii has established a $1,500 scholarship in Roberts' memory.

He was considered by many to be the father of the new Latin American cinema. Biography Birri was born in Santa Fe, Argentina. After being involved in theater and poetry, he went to Rome to study film-making at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, from 1950 to 1953, and appeared in the 1955 Italian film Gli Sbandati. In 1956 he returned to Santa Fe, to form the Film Institute at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral university. A year later he started filming scenes of poverty and human misery in lower-class Santa Fe. The project, billed as a \\"survey film\\", spanned three years, and filming wrapped up in 1958. Before screening the resulting 33-minute documentary, Tire dié, Birri debuted with a short film called La primera fundación de Buenos Aires, which premiered in the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, earning Birri critical acclaim and paving his way for further projects of similar nature, like Buenos Días, Buenos Aires (1960) and more famously Los inundados (1961), which won the Venice Film Festival award for Best First Film. After directing a short film about La Pampa Gringa (La pampa gringa) in 1963, Birri retired from directing and only returned 12 years later to make a movie about Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara (Mi hijo el Che) in 1985. His next film, also about El Che, was filmed in 1997 (Che, ¿muerte de una utopía?), but remained commercially unreleased. Birri has since done two more movies - El siglo del viento (1999) and ZA 05. Lo viejo y lo nuevo (2006). In 1986 Birri co-founded Escuela Internacional de Cine y Television (The International School of Film and Television), in San Antonio de Los Baños, Cuba. He was the school's first director. Birri is currently a visiting professor for fall 2009 at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Birri may hold the record for the longest title of a motion picture ever, for his first film, the short (41 minutes) released at the 1959 Cannes film festival, Vera historia de la primera fundación de Buenos Aires como también de varias navegaciones de muchas partes desconocidas, islas de reinos, también de muchos peligros, peleas y escaramuzas, tanto por tierra como por mar, que nunca han sido descriptos en otras historias o crónicas, extraídos del libro 'Viajes al río de La Plata', original del soldado alemán Ulrico Schmidl, miembro de la expedición capitaneada por don Pedro de Mendoza, quien publicó por primera vez estas memorias, bien anotadas para utilidad pública en la ciudad de Francfort el año 1567.

Playing career Houlker was born in Blackburn and started his long playing career at Blackburn Hornets, progressing through a variety of local sides in his home- town (including Oswaldtwistle Rovers, Cob Wall and Park Road) before joining Blackburn Rovers in August 1894. He remained at Blackburn Rovers for eight seasons. His time at Blackburn Rovers was during a long lean period for the club. During the 1896–97 season they stayed in the First Division only as the result of a decision to increase the number of teams. The final years of the 19th century brought little success for Blackburn Rovers and several narrow escapes from relegation. Houlker won his first England cap against Scotland two days before he left Rovers to join Southern League champions Portsmouth in May 1902. His second cap came against Wales on 2 March 1903 in the only international played at Fratton Park, Portsmouth followed by another cap against Scotland a month later. Houlker then moved along the south coast to join newly crowned Southern League champions Southampton in May 1903. He remained at The Dell for three seasons, helping the Saints to retain the championship in 1903–04, playing alongside Bert Lee and Tommy Bowman. Tenacious and strong, rather than clever, Houlker became very popular with the Southampton public and during his time at The Dell he also won two more England caps against Ireland and Wales in 1906. In 1906 he intended to retire from professional football but was persuaded to rejoin Blackburn Rovers where he turned out regularly until finally retiring in 1907. Retirement didn't last long and he joined Colne in 1909. During World War I he played for Blackburn Rovers in a wartime match when he was 45. He was then working as an overseer at a mill, before running a coal and haulage business in Blackburn before retiring in 1947. He died in 1962, a month after his 90th birthday.

He dreamt that he saw Prophet Muhammad clearly and the Prophet subsequently told him to repeat 'there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger'. After the king repeated these words, the Prophet said that a ship from Jeddah would anchor at the time for afternoon prayers, and the king was to follow the directions of the man who would come out of the ship to pray.

He is the former Member of National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of LaFontaine in Montreal. He formerly represented the Quebec Liberal Party and was the Minister for Family, but was an independent until May 3, 2012, date of his resignation. Tomassi studied at the Université du Québec à Montréal and the Université de Montréal but did not receive a university degree. He was a political aide for Liberal members for Bourget and Jeanne- Mance. He later became a general manager at Group Genco. He was also a member of the Montreal Board of Trade. Tomassi was a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, in the 1993 federal elections but was not elected as the Conservatives were reduced to just two seats in the House of Commons. He would run in provincial politics and was elected in 2003 in LaFontaine as a Liberal. He was re-elected in 2007 and named the parliamentary secretary to Premier Jean Charest. Following the 2008 elections, he was named for the first time in the Cabinet being designated as the Minister for Family replacing Michelle Courchesne who kept the portfolios of Education, Recreation and Sport. On May 6, 2010, after much controversy around the attribution of publicly subsidized daycare licenses, Tony Tomassi was asked to resign as Minister for Family and to leave the Liberal caucus, after it was revealed he was using a business credit card in the name of Canadian Bureau of Investigations and Adjustments while sitting as an MNA. His portfolio was given to Yolande James. On May 3, 2012, he resigned his seat in the Quebec National Assembly. In a brief statement, Tomassi, said he had represented the east-end Montreal LaFontaine riding “with pride.” “And I recognize the confidence they showed in me on three occasions since 2003,” he wrote. “In the circumstances, I tried to remain an MNA present in my riding, accessible and listening to citizens.” In October 2013, his name came up again in the Charbonneau Commission when François Crête, former chief of staff for then-environment minister Line Beauchamp, told the Charbonneau Commission that Tomassi had been lobbying for company called Carboneutre which was run by Domenic Arcuri, who has ties to the Rizzuto clan, and mob enforcer Raynald Desjardins. While the two men were seeking funds from the investment arm of Quebec's largest labour movement, Tomassi, then Minister for Family, was lobbying environment minister Beauchamp to grant the company a permit to decontaminate soil.

He ruled from 1445 to 1459. He is the son of Sultan Muhammad Shah. The original name of Sultan Muzaffar Shah is Raja Kassim and known as Sulutan Wudafona Sha in History of Ming of China. Succession to the throne Raja Kassim, son of Sultan Muhammad Shah and Tun Wati, was installed as the fifth ruler of Malacca after the death of his half-brother Sultan Muhammad Shah. His uncle, Tun Ali was an influential Tamil Muslim leader who allegedly conspired to assassinate the fourth sultan of Malacca, Raja Sri Parameswara Dewa Shah so that his nephew could ascend the throne. After his installation as ruler of Malacca, Raja Kassim titled himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah. Sultan Muzaffar Shah ordered his senior officers to perform all the customs, traditions and prohibitions introduced by his late father. Sultan Muzaffar Shah married the daughter of the Bendahara (Prime Minister) and had a son named Raja Abdullah. Relationship with his Prime Ministers When Bendahara Seri Wak Raja I died, the Sultan appointed Tun Perpatih Sedang, the son of the late Bendahara to replace him and gave him the title Seri Melaka Wak King (II). However, Sri Wak Raja II took his own life by drinking poison when he mistook the Sultan for being displeased with him. He left behind a daughter, Tun Kudu, and two sons, Tun Perak and Tun Perpatih Putih. According to tradition, either Tun Perak should take over his later father's place. However, the Sultan made his own uncle, Tun Ali the new Bendahara out of gratitude for helping him ascend the throne. Sultan Muzaffar Shah later married Tun Kudu. Meanwhile, Tun Perak, was sent away to Klang and made chieftain there to avoid any political turmoil. In 1456, during the reign of King Boromo Trilokanat, Siam made plans to attack Malacca by sea. When the Malacca government learned about this plan, it prepared its naval and decided to attack the Siamese in Batu Pahat. The forces were led by Tun Perak and assisted by Tun Hamzah, a warrior called Datuk Bongkok. A fierce battle took place between the two sides, and this became the first military battle of Malacca. However, Malacca had the advantage in terms of skills and knowledge. They successfully drove the Siamese forces to Singapore and forced them back. Malacca's victory in this war has injected new vigor in the strategy to expand its influence in the Malay Archipelago. The victory over Siam also led to political stability and strengthened the reputation of Malacca in Southeast Asia. Tun Perak's rise in the political arena created tension between him and Tun Ali. Seeing that the feud between these two powerful leaders can lead to disunity among the people of Malacca, Muzaffar decided to level with Tun Ali, who was a middle-aged widower at the time. Tun Ali agreed to step down as Prime Minister provided he be allowed to marry Tun Kudu, who was one of the Sultan's wives. Sultan Muzaffar Shah consented to divorce his wife for the sake of political stability and Tun Kudu also agreed to marry Tun Ali for the well being of the country. The sacrifice of Sultan Muzaffar Shah and Tun Kudu was not in vain. Tun Ali and Tun Perak became close friends and even worked together for the development of Malacca. Soon, Tun Ali himself supported the Sultan's decision to appoint Tun Perak as Prime Minister. Thus, Sultan has appointed Tun Perak as the new bendahara and titled him Paduka Raja around 1456 Later life and death Sultan Muzaffar Shah died in 1459 and his tomb is still in Malacca now.

He wrote primarily in Catalan, although he had an early period of essay-writing in Spanish. His work is notable for its nonconformity, idealism and foreboding of premature death. His poetry, with both avant-garde and traditional influences, begins with the publication of Poemes en ondes hertzianes (Poems in Hertzian Waves) in 1919. The cover illustration for the book was created by Joaquín Torres García. Further works of poetry were \\"La gesta dels estels\\" (The Exploit of the Stars) in 1922 and the culmination of the poet's vital enthusiasm in \\"El poema de la rosa als llavis\\" (Poem of the Rose in the Lips) in 1923. The city of Barcelona has honored him with a statue at the Moll de la Fusta wharf by Robert Krier (Luxembourg, 1938), the pedestal of which bears a plaque with his poem, \\"Nocturn per a acordió\\", referring to the period when the poet was a night watchman there. His poetry has been brought to the public at large, in particular through musical arrangements and recitals by Lluís Llach, Ovidi Montllor, Guillermina Motta, Ramon Muntaner, Xavier Ribalta, Joan Manuel Serrat and Rafel Subirachs, amongst others, as well as Carles Andreu in France.

On one of these nights he was even reported to have run after a thief himself. However, his position is envied by his brother, Raja Ahmad (the ruler of Pahang, a region under Malaccan rule), because Raja Ahmad believed that the rulership of Malacca was his right. Sultan Alauddin had many enemies, both within and outside of his court. He had a total of four children, two from each of his two wives, and this has led to his wives squabbling over the heirship to his throne. The sultan's second wife is from Indian Muslim descent. During this period, Sultan Alaudin has been facing problems with the mamak people, who were beginning to grow in power in comparison to Malays. His new advisor, Bendahara Seri Maharaja (equivalent to the modern-day prime minister) was also of mamak blood. After 11 years on the throne, Sultan Alauddin was reported in history to have died of mysterious causes. Other accounts suggest that he was poisoned in a conspiracy primarily involving Raja Ahmad, Bendahara Seri Maharaja and Tun Senaja, his second wife. His son, Raja Mahmud and his brother-in-law Raja Merlang (Tun Senaja's brother) was also thought to be involved. After his demise, the rulership went to Raja Mahmud, whom he fathered with his Tun Senaja, and denying Raja Munawar, Sultan Alaudin's firstborn son with his first wife Raja Fatimah, who was widely thought to be the true successor to the throne. In any case, the mamak bloodline finally gained control over the Malaccan Empire. However, it was not long before the Portuguese invasion came in 1511, the aftermath of which ended the Sultanate rule over the Malacca. Today, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah's tomb can be found situated in Pagoh, Johor.

The origin of Pouch Cove dates back to 1611, when fisherman from British ships, together with carpenters and other artisans, established a settlement. The town was officially incorporated in 1970. The post office was established in 1975. The Town has a Council consisting of a Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and five councillors. The town's motto is \\"first to see the sun,\\" referring to the sunrise in North America. In 1987 the municipality was amalgamated with the smaller rural settlement of Shoe Cove. The town of Pouch Cove appeared in national and international news in 2020 as a result of a two-year public debate regarding inconsistencies in regulations regarding homes on wheels.

It would be the first international sports car built by Lola since they briefly left the sport in 1992 following the Lola T92/10. It would be succeeded in 2000 by the Lola B2K/10. Development Intended as a cheap yet capable prototype, the B98/10 would not have the input of a major manufacturer to back it, so the car was intended from the start to be offered to privateers and to fulfill a variety of roles in various series. While various elements of the design were similar to other prototypes of the time, multiple unique elements were included. Most noticeable was the front end of the car, which featured blunt fenders with headlights mounted on the side due to the extreme curving angle of the fenders. This also allowed for a large splitter to be used across the entire nose. The air intakes for the engines were also unique in that they were placed underneath the rollbar in a fashion similar to an open-wheel race car. For engines, a wide variety were available to customer teams, but the cars were designed around the use of a Roush- designed Ford 6.0 Litre V8. Many B98/10 chassis used this engine, although others opted for other choices such as a turbocharged Ford V6, a Lotus V8, a Chevrolet V8, a BMW Inline-6, and even a Judd V10. All these engines were able to fit in the small B98/10 chassis, although minor modifications were needed for some engines, such as the turbocharged Ford, needing intakes for the turbo incorporated into the bodywork. A total of eight B98/10s would be built. Chassis history Racing history Although intended for competition in 1998, the first B98/10 chassis would not be completed until December 1998, meaning the cars were forced to make their debut in 1999. Intersport Racing and Konrad Motorsport were the first customers, with Konrad opting to use a Lotus engine in place of the Ford. Both cars would debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona in the Can-Am class for the United States Road Racing Championship, with both cars failing to finish due to mechanical problems. The two teams would then move to the American Le Mans Series opening round, the 12 Hours of Sebring. Joined by a third B98/10 customer, Team Cascadia running a BMW engine, the B98/10s would improve with Intersport taking a 19th place finish. The B98/10 field would be further boosted by the additions of Multimatic Motorsports and the Whittington Brothers, while Team Cascadia would improve to a more powerful Chevrolet V8. Meanwhile, Europe would see the debut of two more B98/10s for the International Sports Racing Series, in the hands of DAMS and Kremer Racing, with DAMS running a Judd GV4 V10. While the American B98/10s struggled against factory teams from Audi, BMW, and Panoz, the European squads saw more success. DAMS would be successful in taking four wins over the season, earning them third in the teams championship. DAMS and Kremer would also be joined by Konrad Motorsport, now using the standard Ford V8 in place of their Lotus V8, for the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. Unfortunately none of the cars would finish. For 2000, the B98/10 would be effectively replaced by the B2K/10, which improved on the B98/10s basic design. However B98/10s would continue in competition. Kremer Racing upgraded their car, terming it the B98/K2000, and were able to take a single win the last race of the Sports Racing World Cup. In North America, Intersport Racing and Multimatic Motorsports would run select races in the Grand American Road Racing Championship and American Le Mans Series. Konrad Motorsport on the other hand would run select races on both continents. In 2001, the only B98/10 still in competition was the car of Kremer Racing, now further upgraded by the team. Running the newly named FIA Sportscar Championship, the B98/10 showed its age by managing points in only two rounds. However 2002 would see a resurrection for the B98/10, when two chassis were purchased for competition. Eventus Motorsport of Germany would run selection FIA Sportscar Championship races, while Bob Berridge Racing had larger plans. Besides running the full FIA Sportscar Championship schedule, Bob Berridge Racing, with the assistance of DAMS, were granted special permission to enter the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the creation of a film about the comic book character Michel Vaillant, with the B98/10 representing the Vaillante, the hero's car. The car would carry film equipment for the bulk of the race making it uncompetitive, yet was necessary to allow for realistic racing scenes. A Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S was entered in a similar fashion to portray the Leader, the enemy's car. The B98/10 would make one final appearance at the 2003 FIA Sportscar Championship Donington round before retiring from competition.

It was made up of three infantry regiments (the 281st, 285th, and 286th) and an artillery regiment. History The division was used as an occupation force in southern France and fought in Italy in 1944 and 1945. Redesignated the 148th Infantry Division in September 1944, it fought in the Po River battles, surrendering to the Brazilian Expeditionary Division on April 28, 1945, after the Battle of Collecchio, near the city of Fornovo at Galano. On April 28, the 148th Infantry Division´s forces were concentrated near the Po river. Trying to stop the Germans crossing, Lieutenant Pitaluga´s squadron, equipped with M8 Greyhound armored reconnaissance cars, opened fire against German troops who almost immediately blew the bridge behind them. Supported by a few Shermans of the 760th American tank battalion, Brazilian 3rd artillery howitzer groups with 105 mm and 155 mm guns, of the Brazilian 1st Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment (this regiment was commanded by Colonel Nelson de Mello), attacked under heavy German artillery and machinegun fire and set up a defensive line four miles from Fornovo, on the line Gaiano–Segalora–Talignano. Near 9 PM a furious German attack was launched against Segalora, trying to break the siege to get to the city of Parma, where other German forces were concentrating, having been repelled by 3rd company, also of the 6th Infantry Regiment. On April 29, the Germans made another try to break the siege. At this moment men of the 2nd Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment, (Major Oest), supported by American tanks, advanced to capture Felegara, which was already occupied by 3rd Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment and Pitaluga´s squadron. With Felegara surrounded, the siege was complete and the German forces retreated to Fornovo Di Taro´s downtown. Besieged, the Germans started negotiations to surrender all their forces to Brazilian command. These forces were from the 148th German Infantry Division, the remnants of an Italian Bersaglieri Division and the 90th Panzer Grenadier Division. On April 29, 1945, the 1st Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment command post were located at Fornovo- Ponte Dogna; also present was the four-star General Mascarenhas de Moraes, Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian forces. Representatives of the German forces showed up to start surrender negotiations. Colonel Floriano de Lima Brayner, represented the Brazilian´s forces; at 1 PM, 13 ambulances with 400 wounded German officers and soldiers arrived. They were immediately removed to the Brazilian campaign hospital at Modena. An hour and half later, another eight ambulances arrived with more wounded men. The first fighting unit to surrender was the 36th Regiment of the 9th motorized division. The troops laid down their arms beside the Collechio-Fornovo-Berceto Road. There were infantry weapons(PACs) of several calibers, 75 and 150 mm mortars, many kinds of vehicles, a column of 105 mm artillery pieces, 88 mm guns mounted on halftracks, 80 in total. There was also much ammunition of all types. Over the next 20 hours, 14,779 men surrendered to Brazilian forces, almost all of them Germans. Also captured were 4,000 horses, 2,500 vehicles and 1,000 motor cycles. Italian general Mario Carloni and Lieutenant General Otto Fretter-Pico with all his staff capitulated.

It is also the season finale of the show's third season. It was written by Joe Keenan and Kevin Murphy and directed by David Grossman. The episode aired in the United States on May 20, 2007. Episode summary Three days before her wedding, Gabrielle wants to know why Carlos hasn’t responded to her wedding invitation and he tells her he's not going because it’ll be awkward. She insists that Edie can’t show up alone because everyone will think she has a problem with him seeing Edie. He says he’ll burst out laughing when she swears “Till death do us part”, so she gives up and tells him he can just come to the reception. Lynette asks her sister Lucy for a loan to pay for her upcoming medical bills she’ll incur in treating the lymphoma, but she is also strapped and can’t help out. She orders her not to tell their mother Stella, but she shows up anyway with her luggage. Gabrielle and Victor have a fight regarding his intention to run for governor of the state. She tells Victor that she was already married to a man who put his career first and she swore never to do it again, while he has vowed to never again let a “stupid woman” hold him back. He tries to apologize, saying he has been under a lot of pressure and she tells him he now has one less thing to worry about since she's intending to cancel the wedding. He says it's too late to cancel but she responds that it's “just in the nick of time”. The next morning Milton shows up early on her doorstep to apologize. She tells him it's not his fault and he insists it is, since Victor has always been desperate for his father's approval, especially since he's never gotten it. She wonders why she should marry a man who values his father's opinion more than hers. Milton tells her that after she left, Victor called him up and “tore him a new one” and blamed him for driving her away. Just then Victor arrives with roses and Milton sneaks out the back. He looks on approvingly as Victor and Gabrielle embrace. Susan is busy planning her wedding with Mike. However Mike is alarmed at how much it may cost as Susan longs for white doves and a champagne fountain. Susan says that with Bree and Gaby marrying with such extravagant ceremonies, she wants to match theirs. She offers to use her credit card, but Mike tells her that it may not be a good idea to start their married life in debt. That night, Mike sets out to work telling Susan he gets triple time on night jobs to pay for the wedding. Gabrielle is ready to walk down the aisle but is freaking out because Bree is late bringing her “something new” which is a bracelet from her honeymoon trip to Switzerland. When she finally arrives, Susan, Lynette and Gabrielle's jaws drop. Bree's pregnant. Later, a flash back shows that Bree and Orson are ready to go back to Wisteria Lane after their honeymoon and it shows that Bree and Orson are planning to fake a pregnancy that could help Danielle. While packing she tells him she wouldn’t blame him if he ran like hell. He swears to love and raise the baby as if it were his own. Edie is feeling guilty about deceiving Carlos into thinking she's gone off the pill and is trying to get pregnant. He, meanwhile, has been doing research and is coming up with ways for her to get pregnant faster. She urges him to “let nature take its course”, and he says that at their age, nature isn’t on their side anymore and that her eggs aren’t “farm fresh”. He also forbids her to drink alcohol, at least until after the baby is born and she's done nursing. She's on her way to Gabrielle's wedding and tells Carlos she’ll see him at the reception. Just as she's leaving, she runs into the paper boy and asks Carlos if he’ll pay him. Carlos is short of cash, so he goes through Edie's purse and finds her birth control pills. At the wedding, Edie is taking the opportunity to quaff some forbidden Scotch when Carlos shows up early and catches her. He holds up the birth control and tells her not to bother explaining. In full earshot of the wedding party, she runs after him, calling his name. She tells him she really does want to have a baby but that she wanted to give him a chance to fall in love with her first. He tells her he doesn’t believe her and he won’t ever trust her again and Edie dissolves in tears. At the reception, Lynette wants to know when Bree's due date and she vaguely answers, “the early fall” and changes the subject. Bree says she can’t believe everything she's missed, especially with Susan and Gabrielle are both getting married. She asks Lynette what's new and she states everything is fine. Gabrielle has gone to fetch Victor so he can meet Bree when she overhears Milton telling Victor that by marrying her, he's secured the Latino vote and the Governor's Mansion is “as good as his”. Victor's not sure he can talk her into him running for Governor but Milton assures him that now that he's her husband, the rules have changed and that a few pricey gifts will “tame that little spitfire”. Gabrielle leaves without letting on what she's heard. She sneaks into an unused room and finds Carlos downing champagne. He says he hopes he didn’t ruin her wedding, but that he's also ruined his life. He laments that a few years ago he had it all - her, the home, the career - and now he has nothing. He's sure she wants to go find Victor but instead she grabs him and kisses him passionately. Lynette keeps sniping at her mother and Stella asks her if she doesn’t think people can change. Lynette says they can’t, so her mother wonders what happened to Lynette, the perfect wife and mother, once Rick came along. Lynette swears nothing happened with Rick because she's nothing like her mother. Stella reminds her that when she got breast cancer, Lynette told her it was “God’s punishment” and she asks Lynette if she feels she's the one being punished now. Lynette orders her out and insists she doesn’t want her money but her mother refuses to go. Stella tells Lynette she can fight her, or she can fight the cancer, because she won’t have the strength to do both. Julie welcomes Bree and Orson home and asks where Danielle is. Bree tells her that she's spending a year abroad in Switzerland. Julie wonders why Danielle hasn’t returned any of her calls or emails and Andrew blames it on the poor reception in the Swiss mountains. “This might not be as easy as we’d hoped”, Bree frets after Julie leaves. Bree, pretending to be Danielle, types an email to Julie and just then Danielle calls from the nunnery where they’ve stashed her to ask to come home. Bree vows she's not coming home until after the baby is born but that they’ll be up to visit her this weekend. She then removes her stomach padding and Orson notes that soon it will be time for the six-month size. Susan feels so guilty that Mike fell asleep at the reception due to all the night jobs he has done for her plans, so she asks the reverend if he has time later that night. Mike receives another late-night plumbing call from a \\"Mrs. Walcott\\" on the phone. As he rushes out, it is revealed that it was Julie on the phone, to divert Mike. When Mike arrives at “Mrs. Wolcott’s”, he finds the reverend with a suit. He leads Mike into a glade in the woods, where Susan is waiting for him in a white dress, under a display of Chinese lanterns. He wants to know if she’ll really be okay with this simple ceremony and she says only one thing has stayed constant in her wedding plans which was him. He tells her he's never seen her look so beautiful. Under the stars, with Julie as their witness, Mike and Susan are finally married. Distraught over her breakup with Carlos, Edie leaves a note for him and then steps onto a chair and attempts to hang herself.

It was rated a grade 2 school (Good) in 2017 by OFSTED. About Southborough Southborough Boys' School was built during the period 1960–1962, at the Ace of Spades (junction) on the A3, principally on the site of the former Ace of Spades Roadhouse, remnants of which can still be seen in the architecture of the buildings to the immediate north of the service station located next to the school. The Roadhouse and Swimming Pool complex were destroyed by fire in the early 1950s. Originally categorised as a 'Secondary Modern' when it opened in 1962, Southborough converted to Academy status in March 2012. Southborough's GCSE results (5ACEM) have been well above the national average for boys for many years. The school's GCSE English Baccalaureate figure is currently double the national average for boys. The school's KS2 – KS4 Value Added figure (2015) is 1005.7 Identity The school was originally opened in 1962 as Southborough Boys' School, being a replacement for Tolworth Boys' School previously sharing the nearby premises occupied by Tolworth Girls' School. The first Headmaster was Mr. H. P. Giddy (a former Royal Marine). Southborough is noticed throughout communities in Kingston upon Thames such as Chessington, Surbiton, Tolworth and New Malden. Some of the students travel from far distances such as Battersea & Richmond by train, however the school does provide a minibus service which goes from Barnes to the school. The school uniform is a black blazer, black trousers, white shirt, school shoes and the school colours. The current tie is navy blue with a Silver Griffin in the middle (to symbolise the appropriate tie length). The original uniform colours were black and gold. The tie being black with diagonal gold stripes consisting of a wide gold 'band' flanked by two fine gold lines. The Griffin emblem originally included a shield bearing a letter 'S'. The name 'Southborough' was believed to originate from the school's location in the south of the Royal Borough of Kingston. However, the only other occurrence of the name in that location during the 1960s was a public house (now a derelict builders' merchants) on the corner of Hook Road and the main A3 which was later renamed \\"The Cap in Hand\\" (a circular reference to the school perhaps?) but which at the time the school was built, was named \\"The Southborough Arms\\", to the amusement of the older pupils at the school. Accessibility The school is situated on a main road, Hook Road, Surbiton and off of the A3 at the Hook, London Junction. The closest railway stations are Chessington North, Tolworth and Surbiton where frequent and quick trains run from Clapham Junction, Vauxhall, Wimbledon, Hinchley Wood, Hampton Court, Guildford, Raynes Park and much more. As well as a vast covering by trains many local buses run (which are free with an Oyster Card) these are; * 71 – Chessington to Kingston via Surbiton. * 465 – Dorking to Kingston via Leatherhead, Malden Rushett, Chessington & Surbiton. * 467 – Epsom to Hook via Ewell & Chessington's Copt Gilders. * 671 – Tiffin School to Chessington South & Chessington's Copt Gilders. * K1 – New Malden to Kingston via Malden Manor & Tolworth. * K4 – Mansfield Park, Chessington to Kingston Hospital via Surbiton, Kingston & Norbiton.

Creators Dan Guntzelman and Steve Marshall pitched the format to CBS that later became the syndicated She's the Sheriff: that of a late sheriff's wife taking over her husband's job, and the challenges she faced as a woman in a male-oriented environment. Annie Potts was originally cast as the titular Cass Malloy, but she was soon dropped during development in favor of Caroline McWilliams, who was in search of a starring vehicle after leaving the hit ABC series Benson. The pilot was shot and greenlighted by CBS, and aired as a one-off on July 21, 1982. The pilot did not perform to CBS' expectations, and thus was not picked up as a series. George Wyner and Lou Richards appeared in both Cass Malloy and She's the Sheriff, but in the CBS pilot, their characters' surnames were different. Wyner played Deputy Max Rosenkrantz, who had hoped to fill the shoes of deceased sheriff Big Jim Malloy, but who was now upset about being passed over in favor of Malloy's wife. Richards played Deputy Dennis Little in the pilot. The cast also featured Glynn Turman as officer Woodrow Freeman, a character that served as the basis for Leonard Lightfoot's Alvin Wiggins in She's the Sheriff; Dick Butkus as officer Alvin Dimsky; Murphy Dunne as Adam Barrett; and Dianne Kay (in her first project after Eight is Enough) as Tina Marie Nelson. Sheriff Cass Malloy had three children in the original pilot: teenager Colleen (Amanda Wyss), preteen Nona (Heather Hobbs) and the youngest, \\"Little Big\\" Jim (Corey Feldman). While She's the Sheriff was set in Lakes County, Nevada, Cass Malloy was situated in Burr County, Indiana. Guntzelman and Marshall would find success as producers a few years later with ABC's Growing Pains, which prompted them to revisit the Cass Malloy teleplay in hopes of finally getting it on the air as a series. Lorimar-Telepictures took an interest in a revised version of the script and greenlighted a series order in 1987 for the then-burgeoning first-run syndication market. Early in production, a two-page ad was placed in the January 5, 1987 issue of Broadcasting & Cable magazine listing the show under the working title Suddenly Sheriff and with Priscilla Barnes as the star (Barnes had been the second replacement for Suzanne Somers on Three's Company.) It is not known exactly when the show's name and casting were finalized.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-01-05-OCR- Page-0028.pdf#search=%22bc-1987-01-05-ocr- page-0028%22http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-01-05-OCR- Page-0029.pdf#search=%22bc-1987-01-05-ocr-page-0029%22 Production David Goldsmith and Arthur Silver were the executive producers, Marty Nadler was producer, Wenda Fong was co-producer and Lisa Lewis was associate producer. Syndication She's the Sheriff was part of NBC's much-hyped \\"Prime Time Begins at 7:30\\" campaign, in which the network's owned-and-operated stations would air first-run sitcoms in the 7:30-8 p.m. time slot to counter competing stations' game shows, sitcom reruns and other offerings. However, this experiment was short-lived, and although She's the Sheriff was renewed for a second season, it was moved to a weekend time slot. {  City Station - Atlanta WXIA 11 - Chicago WGN 9 - Concord WNHT 21 - Des Moines KDSM 17 - Detroit WXON 20 - Great Falls KTGF 16 - Greenville WYFF 4 - Hartford WFSB 3 - Honolulu KGMB 5 - Indianapolis WXIN 59 - Joplin KODE 12 - Knoxville WTVK 26 - New York WNBC 4 - Portsmouth WAVY 10 - Providence WJAR 10 - Spokane KAYU 28 - St. Joseph KQTV 2 - Syracuse WSYT 68 - Tequesta WPBF 25 - Toledo WUPW 36 - Washington, D.C.

After getting his degree in agriculture from Paris, France in 1915, he initially resided in Istanbul while working for the Ministry of Agriculture of the Ottoman Government. During World War I, al- Shihabi joined the Arab Revolt in an attempt to free the Levant region from Ottoman Turkish control. In 1928, while serving as the director of the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, al-Shihabi joined the National Bloc in opposition to the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. He later served as the head of the Syrian Ministry of Education under Prime Minister of Syria Ata al-Ayyubi as well. In 1936, President of Syria Hashim al-Atassi appointed al-Shihabi as the governor of Aleppo, a post al-Shihabi was to hold until 1939. In January 1943, al-Shihabi was appointed as the head of the Syrian Ministry of Finance by Prime Minister Jamil al-Ulshi, though he stepped down that March due to what he perceived as al-Ulshi's pro-French views. When al-Ayyubi took the position of Prime Minister for a second term, al-Shihabi retook his position in the Ministry of Finance. He was appointed as the governor of Latakia by President Shukri al-Quwatli, and was instrumental in the defeat of Sulayman al-Murshid's Alawite uprising. Al-Shihabi was promoted to the rank of secretary-general of the Syrian Council of Ministers in addition to second terms as the governor of both Aleppo and Latakia. Unlike other Quwalti-era officials, al-Shihabi remained in favor with Husni al-Za'im after the latter's CIA-supported coup d'état. After the subsequent coup of Adib Shishakli, al-Shihabi was designated as Syria's ambassador to Egypt. He died in 1968 in Damascus and was buried there. Legacy He exerted strong efforts for Arabization and modernizing the Arabic language by writing many comprehensive modern term indices of science and technology in Arabic. He also has many writings regarding Arab nationalism and the struggle against colonialism. Al-Shihabi was a critic of Turkification under the Ottoman Empire, viewing the 1908 Ottoman constitution as a blow to the status of Arabic.Sami Ayad Hanna, Arab Socialism.

Retrieved 2007-05-06 is an enzyme () of the liver, intestine, and kidney cortex. Fructokinase is in a family of enzymes called transferases, meaning that this enzyme transfers functional groups; it is also considered a phosphotransferase (or, frequently, a kinase) since it specifically transfers a phosphate group. Fructokinase specifically catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the substrate) to fructose as the initial step in its utilization. The main role of fructokinase is in carbohydrate metabolism, more specifically, sucrose and fructose metabolism. The reaction equation is as follows: :ATP + D-fructose → ADP + D-fructose 1-phosphate. Role in plants and bacteria Fructokinase has been characterized from various organisms such as pea (Pisum sativum) seeds, avocado (Persera americana) fruit, and maize (Zea mays) kernels, and many more. Specifically, fructokinase may also regulate starch synthesis in conjunction with SS, sucrose synthase, which first metabolizes sink tissue in plant tissues such as in potatoes. There are also two divergent fructokinase genes that are differentially expressed and which also have different enzymatic properties such as those found in tomatoes. In tomatoes, fructokinase 1 (Frk 1) mRNA is expressed at a constant level during fruit development. However, fructokinase 2 (Frk 2) mRNA has a high expression level in young tomato fruit but then decreases during the later stages of fruit development. Frk 2 has a higher affinity for fructose than Frk 1 but Frk 2 activity is inhibited by high levels of fructose, whereas Frk 1 activity is not. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, a common gram-soil bacterium, fructokinase is also used in the metabolism of mannitol and sorbitol, in addition to the metabolism of fructose. Role in animals and humans In human liver, purified fructokinase, when coupled with aldolase, has been discovered to contribute to an alternative mechanism to produce oxalate from xylitol. In coupled sequence, fructokinase and aldolase produce glycolaldehyde, a precursor to oxalate, from D-xylulose via D-xylulose 1-phosphate. In rat liver cells (hepatocytes), GTP is also a substrate of fructokinase. It can be used at a substantial rate by fructokinase. In these isolated hepatocytes, in vivo, when the concentration of ATP falls to about 1 millimole in a short time interval, GTP becomes an important substrate under these specific conditions. Unlike phosphofructokinase, fructokinase is not inhibited by ATP.BRENDA Diseases Fructosuria or hepatic fructokinase deficiency is a rare but benign inherited metabolic disorder.WebMD Children's Health - Fructosuria. Retrieved 2007-05-06 This condition is caused by a deficiency of fructokinase in the liver. Affected individuals usually display a large blood fructose concentration after the ingestion of fructose, sucrose or sorbitol. The disease is mainly characterized by the detection of the abnormal excretion of fructose in the urine through a urinalysis. Fructokinase is needed for the synthesis of glycogen, the body's form of stored energy, from fructose. The presence of fructose in the blood and urine may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Biochemical abnormalities that may lead to the eventual diagnosis of fructosuria are hepatic fructokinase deficiency, levulosuria and ketohexokinase deficiency.

Fourteen teams competed for the J J Giltinan Shield and Winfield Cup during the season, which culminated in a replay of the previous year's grand final between the Parramatta and Manly-Warringah clubs. During the season, NSWRFL teams also competed for the 1983 KB Cup. 1983 was the final season in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for Sydney- based foundation club Newtown Jets, and the first reduction in the number of teams in the competition since Sydney University’s departure at the end of the 1937 NSWRFL season. It was also the first season that was played with four- point tries. Season summary For the first time, the number of points awarded for scoring a try was raised from three to four. There was also the introduction of a handover if a team was caught in possession six times, which had the effect of killing the traditional scrum but attracted many new followers to a game that had seen attendances decline by fifty percent since the record year of 1968.AFL Tables – Rugby League Crowds summary To counter a lucrative illegal betting market, legal betting via FootyTAB was introduced and was a regarded as a success. Twenty-six regular season rounds were played from February till August, resulting in a top five of Manly-Warringah, Parramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown, Balmain and St. George, who battled it out in the finals. Manly-Warringah managed 23 wins from 28 matches in 1983 – at the time the most wins in a season by a club in NSWRFL premiership history alongside Parramatta’s 23 in 1982. The 1983 season's Rothmans Medallist was Eastern Suburbs’ back, Michael Eden and the Dally M Award went to Western Suburbs’ half, Terry Lamb. Rugby League Week gave their player of the year award to Manly-Warringah winger, Phil Sigsworth.

It was described by Keyserling in 1882, and remained the only species in the genus until 2007, when six more species were described. Description Males have a body length of around 4.1 mm, females being somewhat longer at around 4.4 mm, with a longer abdomen in relation to the carapace. Both sexes have a yellow cephalothorax, which has stronger orange markings in males. The upper (dorsal) surface of the abdomen is pale yellow with a black pattern. The lower surface of both the cephalothorax and abdomen is yellow. The legs and pedipalps are yellow, except for parts of the first leg, which are orange. The palpal bulb of the male has a simpler set of lobes on the tegulum than other species of Prostheclina. Taxonomy Prostheclina pallida was first described by Eugen von Keyserling in 1882; it was the type species for his new genus Prostheclina. Considered to be the only species in the genus from 1950 onwards, six more were added in 2007. Distribution and habitat Prostheclina pallida is an Australian species, known from southern Queensland, inland Victoria and South Australia, where they are found at lower altitudes on both sides of the Great Dividing Range. The genus is only found in less dry areas, typically where the rainfall exceeds 600 mm a year.

He was a nephew of Tsar Nicholas II, Russia's last tsar. Russian prince Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich was the sixth child and fifth son of HIH the Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich ‘Sandro’ (1866–1933) and HIH the Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna (1875–1960)http://nlr.ru/e-res/law_r/show_page.php?page=898&root;=3/22/1/. His parents were paternal first cousins once removed. Consequently, Prince Rostislav was the great-grandson of Tsar Nicholas I (from his father's side), also the great-great-grandson of the same Tsar Nicholas I (from his mother's one), the grandson of Tsar Alexander III and the nephew of Tsar Nicholas II. During the Russian Revolution Prince Rostislav was imprisoned along with his parents and grandmother the Dowager Empress at Dulber, in the Crimea. He escaped the fate of a number of his Romanov cousins who were murdered by the Bolsheviks when he was freed by German troops in 1918. He left Russia in 1919 aboard the Royal Navy ship for Malta, where they spent nine months before moving to England and later settling in Cannes, France. Family Rostislav was married three times. He married first Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Galitzine (7 May 1905 – 5 December 2006) on 1 September 1928 in Chicago. They had one child before divorcing in 1944. She remarried to Lester Armour. *Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich (3 December 1938 – 7 January 1999). Rostislav married Alice Eilken (b. 30 May 1923) on 24 November 1944.

No children were born of this marriage. It is often alleged that Rostislav's marriage with Princess Alexandra Galitzina would have been morganatic. However, holds that it was as acceptable dynastically as the Bagrationi marriage of Vasili's cousin, Vladimir Kirillovich. Since the extinction of the Korecki family in the 17th century, the Golitsyns [Galitzin] have claimed dynastic seniority in the House of Gediminas. The Gediminids were a dynasty of monarchs of Grand Duchy of Lithuania that reigned from the 14th to the 16th century and Emperor Peter I had permitted the Golitsyns to incorporate the emblem of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into their coat of arms.

Definition An exact category E is an additive category possessing a class E of \\"short exact sequences\\": triples of objects connected by arrows : M' \\\\to M \\\\to M\\\\ satisfying the following axioms inspired by the properties of short exact sequences in an abelian category: * E is closed under isomorphisms and contains the canonical (\\"split exact\\") sequences: :: M' \\\\to M' \\\\oplus M\\\\to M; * Suppose M \\\\to M occurs as the second arrow of a sequence in E (it is an admissible epimorphism) and N \\\\to M is any arrow in E. Then their pullback exists and its projection to N is also an admissible epimorphism. Dually, if M' \\\\to M occurs as the first arrow of a sequence in E (it is an admissible monomorphism) and M' \\\\to N is any arrow, then their pushout exists and its coprojection from N is also an admissible monomorphism. (We say that the admissible epimorphisms are \\"stable under pullback\\", resp. the admissible monomorphisms are \\"stable under pushout\\".); * Admissible monomorphisms are kernels of their corresponding admissible epimorphisms, and dually. The composition of two admissible monomorphisms is admissible (likewise admissible epimorphisms); * Suppose M \\\\to M is a map in E which admits a kernel in E, and suppose N \\\\to M is any map such that the composition N \\\\to M \\\\to M is an admissible epimorphism. Then so is M \\\\to M. Dually, if M' \\\\to M admits a cokernel and M \\\\to N is such that M' \\\\to M \\\\to N is an admissible monomorphism, then so is M' \\\\to M. Admissible monomorphisms are generally denoted \\\\rightarrowtail and admissible epimorphisms are denoted \\\\twoheadrightarrow. These axioms are not minimal; in fact, the last one has been shown by to be redundant. One can speak of an exact functor between exact categories exactly as in the case of exact functors of abelian categories: an exact functor F from an exact category D to another one E is an additive functor such that if :M' \\\\rightarrowtail M \\\\twoheadrightarrow M is exact in D, then :F(M') \\\\rightarrowtail F(M) \\\\twoheadrightarrow F(M) is exact in E. If D is a subcategory of E, it is an exact subcategory if the inclusion functor is fully faithful and exact. Motivation Exact categories come from abelian categories in the following way. Suppose A is abelian and let E be any strictly full additive subcategory which is closed under taking extensions in the sense that given an exact sequence :0 \\\\to M' \\\\to M \\\\to M \\\\to 0\\\\ in A, then if M', M are in E, so is M. We can take the class E to be simply the sequences in E which are exact in A; that is, :M' \\\\to M \\\\to M\\\\ is in E iff :0 \\\\to M' \\\\to M \\\\to M \\\\to 0\\\\ is exact in A. Then E is an exact category in the above sense. We verify the axioms: * E is closed under isomorphisms and contains the split exact sequences: these are true by definition, since in an abelian category, any sequence isomorphic to an exact one is also exact, and since the split sequences are always exact in A. * Admissible epimorphisms (respectively, admissible monomorphisms) are stable under pullbacks (resp. pushouts): given an exact sequence of objects in E, ::0 \\\\to M' \\\\xrightarrow{f} M \\\\to M \\\\to 0,\\\\ :and a map N \\\\to M with N in E, one verifies that the following sequence is also exact; since E is stable under extensions, this means that M \\\\times_{M} N is in E: ::0 \\\\to M' \\\\xrightarrow{(f,0)} M \\\\times_{M} N \\\\to N \\\\to 0.\\\\ * Every admissible monomorphism is the kernel of its corresponding admissible epimorphism, and vice versa: this is true as morphisms in A, and E is a full subcategory. * If M \\\\to M admits a kernel in E and if N \\\\to M is such that N \\\\to M \\\\to M is an admissible epimorphism, then so is M \\\\to M: See . Conversely, if E is any exact category, we can take A to be the category of left-exact functors from E into the category of abelian groups, which is itself abelian and in which E is a natural subcategory (via the Yoneda embedding, since Hom is left exact), stable under extensions, and in which a sequence is in E if and only if it is exact in A. Examples * Any abelian category is exact in the obvious way, according to the construction of #Motivation. * A less trivial example is the category Abtf of torsion-free abelian groups, which is a strictly full subcategory of the (abelian) category Ab of all abelian groups. It is closed under extensions: if ::0 \\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0\\\\ :is a short exact sequence of abelian groups in which A, C are torsion-free, then B is seen to be torsion-free by the following argument: if b is a torsion element, then its image in C is zero, since C is torsion-free. Thus b lies in the kernel of the map to C, which is A, but that is also torsion-free, so b = 0. By the construction of #Motivation, Abtf is an exact category; some examples of exact sequences in it are: ::0 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)} \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\\\xrightarrow{(-2, 1)} \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to 0, ::0 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\to 0, ::0 \\\\to d\\\\Omega^0(S^1) \\\\to \\\\Omega^1_c(S^1) \\\\to H^1_{\\\\text{dR}}(S^1) \\\\to 0, :where the last example is inspired by de Rham cohomology (\\\\Omega^1_c(S^1) and d\\\\Omega^0(S^1) are the closed and exact differential forms on the circle group); in particular, it is known that the cohomology group is isomorphic to the real numbers. This category is not abelian. * The following example is in some sense complementary to the above. Let Abt be the category of abelian groups with torsion (and also the zero group). This is additive and a strictly full subcategory of Ab again. It is even easier to see that it is stable under extensions: if ::0 \\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0\\\\ :is an exact sequence in which A, C have torsion, then B naturally has all the torsion elements of A. Thus it is an exact category; some examples of its exact sequences are ::0 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/4\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to 0, ::0 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\xrightarrow{(1,0,0)} (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to 0, ::0 \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\xrightarrow{(0,1,0)} \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\to 0, :where in the second example, the (1,0,0) means inclusion as the first summand, and in the last example, the (0,1,0) means projection onto the second summand. One interesting feature of this category is that it illustrates that the notion of cohomology does not make sense in general exact categories: for consider the \\"complex\\" ::\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\xrightarrow{(1,0,0)} (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\xrightarrow{(0,1,0)} \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} :which is obtained by pasting the marked arrows in the last two examples above. The second arrow is an admissible epimorphism, and its kernel is (from the last example), (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}) \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Z}. Since the two arrows compose to zero, the first arrow factors through this kernel, and in fact the factorization is the inclusion as the first summand. Thus the quotient, if it were to exist, would have to be \\\\mathbb{Z}, which is not actually in Abt. That is, the cohomology of this complex is undefined.

Alfred Elwes (1819–1888) was a nineteenth-century British author of children's literature, academic, philologist, and occasional translator of French, Italian and Portuguese literature into English. He is perhaps best remembered for his translation of the medieval Arthurian romance Jaufry the Knight and the Fair Brunissende; a Tale of the Times of King Arthur. Life and career Elwes was born in 1819 at Woolwich, Kent.Allibone, S. Austin. A Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors Living and Deceased, from the Earliest Accounts to the Latter Half of the Nineteenth Century. London, Trübner & Co., 1871, vol. III, p. 2781 (a digression under the entry for Joseph Wilson). In his education Elwes attained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. He studied at Leiden in the Netherlands. Subsequently Elwes was Professor of English at Leghorn, Tuscany. His earliest known work, Il Nuovo Vergani (1845), a grammar in Italian for the study of English, was probably written and published during his tenure in this position, as was, no doubt, his earliest known translation, A new and complete Italian grammar by Vergani (1846), which would have performed the same office in English for the study of Italian. Later, after returning to England, Elwes served as President of the British Literary Society in a term beginning in 1857The British Controversialist, and Literary Magazine, n.s., v. 5, 1858, London, Houlston and Wright, 1858, p. 279. and running through 1858.The British Controversialist, and Literary Magazine, n.s., v. 6, 1858, London, Houlston and Wright, 1858, p. 192.The Literary and Education Year Book for 1859, London, Kent and Co., [1858], p. 274. In 1868 he served, along with Samuel Neil, as one of the two vice-presidents of the newly established British Literary Union.The Quarterly Journal of the British Literary Union, Preliminary Number, April 1868, London, Longmans, Green, & Co., p. [34]. In 1870 he held the position of Official Translator of Modern Languages in London. He died in December 1888 in Kensington. Literary works Elwes' interests in Continental languages and travel are reflected in most of his works. He both wrote and translated travel literature, and much of his children's fiction details the lives or adventures of young protagonists in European locales. In addition to his works published in book form, Elwes contributed prose and verse to various periodicals. Elwes was the compiler of a number of English/Romance dictionaries, as well as Romance language grammars for the use of students learning the languages, all reissued in various editions into the twentieth century.

College  A tailback at 230 pounds with 4.7CFL.ca Network :: Official site of the Canadian Football League speed in the 40-yard dash, Stephenson established himself as a leading rusher in Canadian University Football. In his very first game in the CIS and on his very first carry, Stephenson took a hand off 49 yards up the middle and scored a touchdown in the Lancers season opening 30–28 victory over Queen's. That year (2004), Stephenson rushed for 1,192 yards to establish a new CIS rookie rushing record and was named the Norm Marshall Trophy winner as the OUA Football Rookie of the Year. In 2005, Stephenson rushed for 1,306 yards and 12 touchdowns en route to capturing his first CIS Rushing Title. In the process, he was named a first team offense member of the 2005 CIS Football All-Canadian Team and an OUA First Team All-Star. In 2006, he was awarded the Hec Crighton Trophy as the Canadian University Football Player of the Year. Stephenson also captured his second straight CIS rushing title with 1,140 yards, helping the Lancer Football squad to a 6–2 record and a top ten ranking in Canada. He was also named the OUA Most Outstanding Player, a CIS First Team All-Canadian and an OUA First Team All-Star. He also made history as he became the first player in CIS history to rush for 1,000 yards in 3 straight seasons (2004 to 2006). After his first four seasons, his 4,402 career rushing yards was an OUA record and placed him third all-time in Canadian University Football history. In 2007, Stephenson played in parts of only four games due to injuries and still ranked fifth in the province and eighth in the nation with a rushing total of 764 yards. Stephenson scored a total of four touchdowns that season with the Windsor Lancers. Stephenson topped all the running backs at the 2008 CFL Evaluation Camp with a 37-inch vertical jump. On September 13, 2008, Stephenson became the all-time leading rusher in CIS history by surpassing Dominic Zagari of the University of Manitoba's record of 4738 yards set from 1991–95. He also became the first running back in Canadian University History to rush for over 5,000 yards in a career. His final collegiate total sits at 5,163 rushing yards.

DEAD.' The note, which was mailed in Somerville, New Jersey, on April 23, instructed her to have the money ready by Wednesday, April 26. The money, which the author of the note claimed '...is a small amount for this kind of business', was to be in hundred and thousand dollar bills. Mrs. Kuser was then to wait for a Mr. Copeland to phone her on Wednesday at noon with instructions on how and when to deliver the money. The author requested in a postscript that the money be sealed in a large business envelope.\\" A man named George Sabol was arrested and confessed. Later career Kuser's political career came to an end in 1935, when his wife, Brooke Russell, divorced him amid allegations of abuse and cruelty. Democratic Assemblyman James Bowers captured Kuser's State Senate seat that year. Three months later, Kuser remarried again and moved to Reno, Nevada, where he became a newspaper columnist. From 1937 to 1942, he was an insurance agent and real estate broker in Somerville, New Jersey. Kuser worked as a consultant to the New Jersey Department of Conservation and Economic Development from 1958 until his death in 1964. Personal life In 1919, Kuser married 17-year-old Brooke Russell, later known as Brooke Astor, the daughter of General John H. Russell. Together, they had one child: *Anthony Dryden Kuser (1924–2014)Miller, Judith. \\"Old Money, New Needs\\", The New York Times, November 17, 1991.

History Beginning as early as the 1830s, it became popular legend that \\"under this tree Washington first took command of the American Army\\" (supposedly the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow). The publication of the fictional \\"eye-witness\\" journal The Diary of Dorothy Dudley in 1876 furthered the legend. Although George Washington did take command of the army on 3 July 1775, there is no official documentation stating that this event took place under the tree. In 1923, the tree was very fragile and diseased. Workers from the parks department of Cambridge were cutting two of the remaining limbs. Upon cutting the second limb, the entire tree fell over onto its iron fence and brought the Boston Elevated Railway cable to within 15 feet (4.57 m) of the ground. The tree was divided up into approximately 1000 pieces, and these were distributed to all states and their legislatures. The cross-section of the tree was sent to Mount Vernon. About 150 pieces were given over-the-counter, a few hundred were mailed throughout the country, and some fraternal organizations received pieces as well. Root shoots were sent to locations throughout the nation, and some of them still thrive today. An offshoot tree in the state of Washington was used to create the tree seen here today. In 1925, the legend was openly discredited at the Cambridge Historical Society (CHS), when Samuel F. Batchelder read a paperThe Washington Elm Tradition he later reprinted as The Washington Elm Tradition: \\"Under This Tree Washington First Took Command of the American Army\\" Is It True?. Batchelder revealed the forgeries in the tales told about Washington and the tree, in short calling the myth altogether not realistic, but the beliefs persist today. Many websites are outdated in stating that the tree still exists and that it is indeed where Washington first took command. Today, a plaque embedded in the pavement of Garden Street (at its Mason St. intersection) marks where the tree used to stand. The Cambridge Historical Commission (CHC) has called the association of Washington and the elm a \\"myth\\" and stated that \\"the image of the tree remains a symbol of patriotism in Cambridge.\\"Cambridge Historical Commission FAQ Descendant trees Of the 1,000 pieces that were distributed, many are still standing today. Bellingham, WA - 1621 Eldridge Ave. While the story of how the particular tree came to live in Bellingham is unclear, a tree still standing (as of 2017) at this address is said to be a descendant of the Washington Elm. Loveland, CO 205 E Eisenhower Blvd, Loveland, CO 80537. The Washington Elm Tree in the Walgreens parking lot between Lincoln and Cleveland avenues has been here since a sickly version of the tree first came to Loveland in 1932. Root shoots from the original tree were sent to DAR chapters throughout the nation, including Loveland's Namaqua Chapter, and the tree was planted in the yard of what was then the Lincoln School. The tree is one of the few Washington Elm offshoots still thriving in the nation, but another DAR member is working to carry on the tree's heritage. Corrine Yahn, who teaches geology at Front Range Community College, works with Front Range laboratory coordinator Susan Brown on micropropagation. For about a year, Yahn said they've been using samples from the Loveland elm to essentially try and clone the tree. http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_25738880/loveland-daughters- american-revolution-raise-funds-historic-tree References External links and further reading * Howard Mansfield, \\"The Bones of the Earth\\".

From 2005 to 2014, he appeared as Lord Sugar's adviser in the British television series The Apprentice. Since January 2012, he has presented the Channel 4 programme Countdown with Rachel Riley and Susie Dent, having taken over from Jeff Stelling. He is the fifth presenter of Countdown and the longest-serving one since the original host, Richard Whiteley. Early life Hewer was born in Swindon on 17 February 1944. His mother was Mary Patricia Hewer (née Jamison; 1918 - 1999) and his father, John David Radbourn Hewer (1915 - 2010), was a senior partner of Hewer, Spriggs and Wilson, a veterinary practice in the Old Town area of Swindon. They met when both were university students in Dublin. The family lived in Old Town and Hewer was educated at Clongowes Wood College, an exclusive Jesuit boarding school in County Kildare, Ireland. Hewer has two sisters and two brothers. Hewer's grandfather, John Radbourn Hewer, began as a vet in Swindon in 1912. His maternal grandfather, Oswald Jamison, was High Sheriff of Belfast during the 1920s. \\\\- He secured a place to study law at Trinity College, Dublin, but his parents could not afford the fees for him to go there. Career Hewer moved to London in the 1960s aged 20 to join a public relations (PR) consultancy as a trainee. Within six years he had joined the board and eventually bought out the owner, becoming the sole shareholder. His PR company was hired by Amstrad to represent them in 1983. He spent 21 years in the Amstrad management group. He sold his PR agency in 1998. Hewer's status as a businessman and public figure has been used in various ways; for example, in 2012, he was one of many celebrities to help promote the change in the UK pension scheme to automatic enrolment. In 2013, he worked with Vista Print on their \\"Build Your Small Business\\" campaign, and in 2014 worked with Bark.com to promote its services marketplace product. Television Hewer and the ex-Amstrad owner, Alan Sugar, became friends through their working relationship. He became one of Sugar's advisers in The Apprentice on BBC One. On 18 December 2014, Hewer revealed that he had decided to leave the show after the tenth series, believing it to be \\"the appropriate time\\". On 9 January 2012, Hewer became the new host of the Channel 4 game show Countdown taking over from the sports presenter Jeff Stelling. In July 2012, Hewer presented a four-part series on BBC Two called The Farm Fixer, in which he assisted farmers in Northern Ireland in diversifying. He also presented two BBC One series, The Town that Never Retired and We All Pay Your Benefits with Margaret Mountford. On 28 August 2013, he appeared in an episode of BBC One's, Who Do You Think You Are?. In July 2014, Hewer co-presented a BBC One documentary series with Margaret Mountford called Nick and Margaret: Too many Immigrants? which researched the impact of and attitudes towards immigrants in the UK. Hewer has appeared on the panel shows Would I Lie to You? (2011), Ask Rhod Gilbert (2011), Have I Got News for You (2011, 2012, 2014, 2016), Room 101 (2012) and Big Star's Little Star (2015). In December 2015, he appeared, with Mountford, in BBC's Celebrity Antiques Road Trip. Personal life Hewer married Margo Spindler in 1973. They were divorced in 1985 after they had had two children. His son, James, briefly acted as co-director of his father's company. Hewer has been a patron of the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action since 2015. In 2017, he presented the charity's BBC Radio 4 charity appeal during Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. In July 2008, Hewer took part in the charity driving event, the Mongol Rally, in a Renault 4, driving from London to Ulan Bator. He raised over £12,000 for Hope and Homes for Children. He wrote a series of blogs about his journey for the online travel section of the Daily Telegraph. For many years, Hewer was a supporter of the Labour Party. While appearing on Question Time in 2017 he said that he had supported the party since Harold Wilson, but was critical of the leaderships of Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband. In January 2019, he said that he would no longer vote for Labour, after his Countdown co- presenter Rachel Riley received abuse on social media for speaking out against anti-Semitism within the party. On 2 November 2012, Hewer received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Kingston University in recognition of his \\"outstanding contribution to business and entrepreneurship\\". On 1 April 2019, Hewer became the President of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.

The book is loosely structured around the fictional life story of Stephen Colbert as he appears on The Colbert Report. As of the April 6, 2008 publishing, the book had been on the New York Times Bestseller List in the Hardcover Nonfiction category for twenty-four weeks, ranking number one for fourteen of them. Description I Am America (And So Can You!) is described as being a \\"pure extension\\" of The Colbert Report, delving into the views of Colbert's \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed high status idiot\\" character on what he considers to be the most pressing issues facing the United States. The book is influenced by the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as Bill O'Reilly's book, The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Sean Hannity's Deliver Us From Evil (2004), which Colbert says he forced himself to read as a reference.Colbert, Stephen (October 16, 2007). \\"Meet the Author\\" podcast.

Prendergast joined the team during the 2001 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the 2012 championship. During that time he won three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. Prendergast ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Prendergast is a dual player with Ardmore. His brother, Séamus Prendergast, also played inter-county hurling with Waterford. Playing career Club Prendergast plays his club hurling and Gaelic football with Ardmore and has enjoyed some success. In 2002 he won a county intermediate hurling championship medal following a 2-5 to 0-10 defeat of Clonea. Inter- county Prendergast made his senior debut for Waterford in a National League game against Tipperary in 2001, however, he remained on the periphery for another two seasons. By 2004 Prendergast was a regular member of the starting fifteen. That year Waterford qualified for a third successive Munster final with Cork providing the opposition once again. Described as the game that had everything Waterford beat Cork by 3-16 to 1-21 to win one of the greatest games of hurling ever played. It was Prendergast's first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Waterford take on a wounded Kilkenny team. In spite of this 'the Cats' were the winners by 3-12 to 0-18. Three years later Prendergast added a National Hurling League medal to his collection when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0-20 to 0-18 in the final. He later claimed a second Munster medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3-17 to 1-14 in the provincial decider. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed Prendergast's side in the All-Ireland semi-final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start Prendergast's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty- five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to trounce Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. Prendergast lined out in another Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a third Munster winners' medal for Prendergast. In April 2012 Prendergast announced his retirement from inter-county hurling saying \\"I just feel I have enough done at this stage, I'm involved for 12 years and feel that that's probably enough.\\" In spite of his hurling retirement, Prendergast joined the Waterford junior football team later in 2012. Inter-provincial Prendergast also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games.

Meanwhile, at Rome Pope Leo X had provided Robert Forman, dean of Glasgow, to the vacant see, while at the same time the Duke of Albany had nominated one James Ogilvie, who quickly became Abbot of Dryburgh instead.

Wright examines the origins of the militant organization Al-Qaeda, the background for various terrorist attacks and how they were investigated, and the events that led to the September 11 attacks. The book was a New York Times best-seller and won a number of awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. A 10-episode television miniseries adaptation aired in 2018 on Hulu.  Overview  The Looming Tower is largely focused on the people who conspired to commit the September 11 attacks, their motives and personalities, and how they interacted. The book starts with Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian religious scholar who visited the United States in the late 1940s and returned to his home to become an anti-West Islamist and eventually a martyr for his beliefs. There is also a portrait of Ayman al-Zawahiri, from his childhood in Egypt to his participation in and later leadership of Egyptian Islamic Jihad to his merging of his organization with Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden is the person described the most, from his childhood in Saudi Arabia in a rich family, his participation in the jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, his role as a financier of terrorist groups, his stay in Sudan, his return to Afghanistan, and his interactions with the Taliban. The 1998 United States embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya are described, as is the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. Lawrence Wright also describes in detail some of the Americans involved, in particular Richard A. Clarke, chief counter-terrorism adviser on the U.S. National Security Council, and John P. O'Neill, an Assistant Deputy Director of Investigation for the FBI who served as America's top bin Laden hunter until his retirement from the FBI in August 2001, after which he worked as head of security at the World Trade Center, where he died in the 9/11 attacks. The book also describes some of the problems associated with the lack of cooperation between the FBI, the CIA, and other U.S. government organizations that prevented them from uncovering the 9/11 plot in time. Because The Looming Tower is to a large extent focused on telling the story of the people involved, it does not describe the 9/11 plot and its execution in much detail. It focuses more on the background and the conditions that produced the people who planned and staged the attack, and information about those who were combating terror against the United States.  Quran reference in title  The words \\"looming towers\\" or \\"lofty towers\\" () appear in the Quran (Sūrat an-Nisā'). According to Wright, Osama bin Laden, at a wedding before the 9/11 attacks, quoted the line, repeating it three times: \\"Wherever you are, death will find you, even if you are in lofty towers\\" (, ).Lawrence Wright Interview at The Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley, page 3.

Knowledge of the distributions can be used to determine the likelihood that one parameter exceeds another, and by how much. This technique can be used for dimensioning of mechanical parts, determining when an applied load exceeds the strength of a structure, and in many other situations. This type of analysis can also be used to estimate the probability of failure or the frequency of failure. Dimensional interference Interference of measurement distributions to determine fit of parts Mechanical parts are usually designed to fit precisely together. For example, if a shaft is designed to have a \\"sliding fit\\" in a hole, the shaft must be a little smaller than the hole. (Traditional tolerances may suggest that all dimensions fall within those intended tolerances. A process capability study of actual production, however, may reveal normal distributions with long tails.) Both the shaft and hole sizes will usually form normal distributions with some average (arithmetic mean) and standard deviation. With two such normal distributions, a distribution of interference can be calculated. The derived distribution will also be normal, and its average will be equal to the difference between the means of the two base distributions. The variance of the derived distribution will be the sum of the variances of the two base distributions. This derived distribution can be used to determine how often the difference in dimensions will be less than zero (i.e., the shaft cannot fit in the hole), how often the difference will be less than the required sliding gap (the shaft fits, but too tightly), and how often the difference will be greater than the maximum acceptable gap (the shaft fits, but not tightly enough). Physical property interference Interference of distributions of applied load and strength Physical properties and the conditions of use are also inherently variable. For example, the applied load (stress) on a mechanical part may vary. The measured strength of that part (tensile strength, etc.) may also be variable. The part will break when the stress exceeds the strength. With two normal distributions, the statistical interference may be calculated as above. (This problem is also workable for transformed units such as the log-normal distribution). With other distributions, or combinations of different distributions, a Monte Carlo method or simulation is often the most practical way to quantify the effects of statistical interference.

Historically, it favored constant attackers as it was based on the distance spent in a breakaway, included winning checkpoints and outright stage wins. Today, the winner is chosen by a jury. Besides the overall winner, the jury also awards a combativity award to the most aggressive rider at the end of each stage, with this rider allowed to wear a red bib the following race day. The 1981 Tour de France marked the last time the winner of the general classification also won the combativity award.  History  Since 1952, after every stage the most combative cyclist was given an award, and an overall competition was recorded. At the end of the 1956 Tour de France, André Darrigade was named the most attacking cyclist. At this point, the award was given the same importance as the award for the cyclist with the most bad luck, Picot in 1956. In 1961, the award was not given to an individual cyclist, but to an entire team, the regional team West- South-West. The system of the award has changed during the years. Historically, riders accumulated points, and the cyclist with the most points at the end of the Tour was declared winner. The cyclist did not have to finish the race, for example in 1971 Luis Ocaña crashed out while wearing the Yellow Jersey on the Col de Mente in stage 14 and in 1972 Cyrille Guimard was wearing the Green Jersey and in 2nd place overall when he withdrew, but both were still given the combativity award. In 1979, the combativity award was initially given to Joop Zoetemelk; he was later disqualified and Hennie Kuiper received the award. In a system that was implemented 2003, a jury of eight specialists in cycling selected the most combative cyclist of each stage (excluding time trials), with the classification for most distance in breakaway groups only part of the decision. There is no jersey for the most combative rider of the previous stage, but he can be recognized by the race number worn on his back: it consists of a white number on a red background instead of the usual black on white (since 1998). At the end of the Tour de France, a \\"super-combativity award\\" is given to the most combative cyclist of the race. , the total prize money for the super-combativity award winner is €20,000.

It stars Ti Lung, Derek Yee, Ching Li, Yueh Hua, Fan Mei-sheng and Ku Feng. The film is based on Duoqing Jianke Wuqing Jian of Gu Long's Xiaoli Feidao Series of novels. It was one of Shaw Brothers' highest grossing films in the studio's history, and it was followed by a sequel, Return of the Sentimental Swordsman, in 1981. An in- name-only \\"sequel\\", Perils of the Sentimental Swordsman, was released in 1982, with no relation to the main character of Little Flying Dagger Li, being based instead in the Lu Xiaofeng novel series (also by Gu Long), and its previous film adaptations.  Synopsis  Due to his own extreme ideals, famed swordsman Li has lost everyone dear to him. After his life is saved by a rival swordsman, Li's overwhelming pride makes him forsake the woman he loves and lets her marry his saviour. Now resigned to traveling the country with his loyal aide, Li's only comfort is alcohol and the simple life he has now accepted. On one such journey, the lonely swordsman befriends the exceptionally skilled, yet secretive Fei who has his own pressures to contend with. Li then finds himself embroiled in a battle to own the highly prized 'gold armour shirt' — a protective vest that can withstand any blow. As he discovers that many of the people he meets have a hidden agenda, Li realizes that Fei is the only man he can truly trust. This new friendship is put under a test when the 'sentimental swordsman' is hunted down by numerous hired killers and framed for a series of crimes he didn't commit. The person behind Li's troubles proves to be elusive, though all the clues seem to point to the legendary 'Plum Blossom Bandit', a disguised figure whose identity has long proved elusive to the martial world.

The Astoria project was announced at MIX 2007, and the first developer preview was made available on April 30, 2007. The first CTP was made available as a part of the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions Preview. The final version was released as part of Service Pack 1 of the .NET Framework 3.5 on August 11, 2008. The name change from ADO.NET Data Services to WCF data Services was announced at the 2009 PDC. Overview WCF Data Services exposes data, represented as Entity Data Model (EDM) objects, via web services accessed over HTTP. The data can be addressed using a REST-like URI. The data service, when accessed via the HTTP GET method with such a URI, will return the data. The web service can be configured to return the data in either plain XML, JSON or RDF+XML. In the initial release, formats like RSS and ATOM are not supported, though they may be in the future. In addition, using other HTTP methods like PUT, POST or DELETE, the data can be updated as well. POST can be used to create new entities, PUT for updating an entity, and DELETE for deleting an entity. Description Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) comes to the rescue when we find ourselves not able to achieve what we want to achieve using web services, i.e., other protocols support and even duplex communication. With WCF, we can define our service once and then configure it in such a way that it can be used via HTTP, TCP, IPC, and even Message Queues. We can consume Web Services using server side scripts (ASP.NET), JavaScript Object Notations (JSON), and even REST (Representational State Transfer). Understanding the basics When we say that a WCF service can be used to communicate using different protocols and from different kinds of applications, we will need to understand how we can achieve this. If we want to use a WCF service from an application, then we have three major questions: 1.Where is the WCF service located from a client's perspective? 2.How can a client access the service, i.e., protocols and message formats? 3.What is the functionality that a service is providing to the clients? Once we have the answer to these three questions, then creating and consuming the WCF service will be a lot easier for us. The WCF service has the concept of endpoints. A WCF service provides endpoints which client applications can use to communicate with the WCF service. The answer to these above questions is what is known as the ABC of WCF services and in fact are the main components of a WCF service. So let's tackle each question one by one. Address: Like a webservice, a WCF service also provides a URI which can be used by clients to get to the WCF service. This URI is called as the Address of the WCF service. This will solve the first problem of \\"where to locate the WCF service?\\" for us. Binding: Once we are able to locate the WCF service, one should think about how to communicate with the service (protocol wise). The binding is what defines how the WCF service handles the communication. It could also define other communication parameters like message encoding, etc. This will solve the second problem of \\"how to communicate with the WCF service?\\" for us. Contract: Now the only question one is left with is about the functionalities that a WCF service provides. The contract is what defines the public data and interfaces that WCF service provides to the clients. The URIs representing the data will contain the physical location of the service, as well as the service name. It will also need to specify an EDM Entity-Set or a specific entity instance, as in respectively http://dataserver/service.svc/MusicCollection or http://dataserver/service.svc/MusicCollection[SomeArtist] The former will list all entities in the Collection set whereas the latter will list only for the entity which is indexed by SomeArtist. The URIs can also specify a traversal of a relationship in the Entity Data Model. For example, http://dataserver/service.svc/MusicCollection[SomeSong]/Genre traverses the relationship Genre (in SQL parlance, joins with the Genre table) and retrieves all instances of Genre that are associated with the entity SomeSong. Simple predicates can also be specified in the URI, like http://dataserver/service.svc/MusicCollection[SomeArtist]/ReleaseDate[Year eq 2006] will fetch the items that are indexed by SomeArtist and had their release in 2006. Filtering and partition information can also be encoded in the URL as http://dataserver/service.svc/MusicCollection?$orderby=ReleaseDate&$skip=100&$top=50 Although the presence of skip and top keywords indicates paging support, in Data Services version 1 there is no method of determining the number of records available and thus impossible to determine how many pages there may be. The OData 2.0 spec adds support for the $count path segment (to return just a count of entities) and $inlineCount (to retrieve a page worth of entities and a total count without a separate round-trip....).

Geography and geology The district covers approximately 9.97 km² of land on the Cù Lao Ré volcanic islands, consisting of two off-shore volcanic islands in the East Sea, and a few islets. The main island, Lý Sơn (Cù Lao Ré) has three prominent craters, the largest of which is Mount Thoi Loi (Thới Lới). Hydrothermal waters on Lý Sơn provide heat for the local power plant. The secondary island is known as Little Island (Cù Lao Bờ Bãi) and is also well populated. History Remains of the pre-200 C.E. Sa Huỳnh culture have been found on the islands. The Cham used Ly Son as a transhipment base. Xó La well, one of the wells used to provide fresh water for ships, still remains on the shore of the main island and is still in use.Hardy 2009, 111 The islands were used as a geographical landmark for navigation by Admiral Zheng He's crew during the 15th-century treasure voyages. In the 17th century the Nguyễn lords started a colony on the islands from An Vĩnh, Bình Sơn District, in Quảng Ngãi, as part of the activities of the Hoàng Sa Company's development of the Paracel Islands.Chemillier-Gendreau, Monique (2000).

Feeney joined the team during the 1993-94 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2008 championship. During that time he won one Munster winners' medal. Feeney ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Feeney is a one-time county championship medalist with Ballyduff Upper. He also played with the Sarsfield's in Cork. Playing career Club Feeney played his club hurling with the Ballyduff Upper club in Waterford. In 2007 he lined out in the final of the county championship with Ballygunner providing the opposition. A 1-18 to 1-14 victory gave Feeney a Waterford Senior Hurling Championship medal. Feeney also spent one season with the Sarsfield's club in Cork. Inter-county Feeney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Waterford minor hurling team. In 1992 he won a Munster medal in that grade following a two- game series with Tipperary. Waterford later qualified for the All-Ireland final, but Galway had a 1-13 to 2-4 victory. Feeney made his senior debut for Waterford in a National Hurling League game against Wexford in 1993. In 2002 Waterford reached the Munster final. Feeney collected a Munster medal that year as Waterford beat Tipperary by 2-23 to 3-12. It was their first provincial win in thirty-nine years. Waterford's championship came to an end in the All-Ireland semi-final. Feeney was a regular at full-back by this stage, however, he missed out on Waterford's Munster triumph in 2004 and their National League success in 2007. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this start, Feeney's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to defeat Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. Following this defeat, Feeney retired from his inter-county career. Inter- provincial Feeney was also a regular on the Munster team during a number of inter-provincial games.

Other common names by which it is known by include gray, grizzled or Sunda Island surili; grizzled or stripe-crested langur; Javan grizzled langur; grizzled, Java or Javan leaf monkey; langur gris. There are two subspecies of the Javan surili: * Presbytis comata comata - Occurs in western Java * Presbytis comata fredericae - Occurs in central Java This colobine species has a sacculated stomach to assist the breakdown in the cellulose from the leaves it feeds on. It has a small, slender face and tail, and large round stomachs. Its coloring ranges from dark gray to white. Leaf monkeys tend to be active during the day, spending up to 5 hours grooming themselves.  Distribution  The Javan surili is found in the western half of Java, Indonesia. It ranges as far east as Mt. Lawu on the border with East Java. According to a recent study, this species is mostly confined to Sundaland due to changes in the geography, sea level and vegetation that occurred during the Pleistocene era, and partly due to the type of vegetation and soil there today. The Javan surili lives in primary and secondary lowland rainforests, with an altitudnal range of 2500 meters.  Ecology  The Javan surili mostly consumes leaves, however, it will also consume flowers, fruits, and seeds. This species appears to be more folivorous than any other member of the genus Presbytis, with over 62% of its overall diet composed of young leaves and 6% of mature leaves.  Conservation  This species is currently listed on the IUCN red list of endangered species because of habitat loss due to human activity. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 exist today in their natural habitat and only 4% of their natural habitat remains. Most of the loss of its original habitat is due to the clearing of the rainforests in Indonesia. Only 4% of its original habitat remains and the population has decreased by at least 50% in the last ten years. Of the two subspecies of P. comata, the frediricae subspecies is among the rarest and most at risk for extinction, located in one of the most highly populated areas on the island and near an active volcano.

Medical uses Iloperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, iloperidone demonstrated mild effectiveness. As effective as lurasidone, and 13 to 15% less effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine. It generally appears to work better than placebo.  Side effects  Examination of the safety and tolerability of iloperidone have shown that at a 5 mg/day dose in healthy male volunteers, the drug was fairly well tolerated, although hypotension, dizziness, and somnolence were very common side effects ranging from mild to moderate in severity. A second study showed that co administration of food decreased the severity of these effects. This study also indicated that repeat administration of iloperidone could decrease the effects of hypotension. The approved dose is 12–24 mg not 5 mg. However, claims of better tolerance have been reported. In some cases (prevalence unknown), it can greatly increase agitation and aggressivity like all antipsychotics drugs. Discontinuation The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.  Pharmacology  Iloperidone is a monoamine directed towards acting upon and antagonizing specific neurotransmitters, particularly multiple dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes. It is considered an ‘atypical’ antipsychotic because it displays serotonin receptor antagonism, similar to other atypical antipsychotics. The older typical antipsychotics are primarily dopamine antagonists. Iloperidone has been shown to act as an antagonist at all tested receptors. It exhibits high (nM) affinity to serotonin 5HT2A (Ki value of 5.6 nM), dopamine D2 (6.3 nM) and D3 (7.1 nM) and noradrenaline α1 receptors (0.36 nM), moderate affinity for dopamine D4 (25 nM), serotonin 5HT6 (43 nM), 5HT7 (22 nM), and low affinity for the serotonin 5HT1A (168 nM), dopamine D1 and histamine H1 receptors. In addition, pharmacogenomic studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with an enhanced response to iloperidone during acute treatment of schizophrenia.Scott L.Iloperidone: In Schizophrenia . CNSDrugs 2009; 23(10):867-880. . Regulatory approval It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States on May 6, 2009. Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc. made initial inquiries into the drug; however, in May 1996, they discontinued research, and in June 1997 gave research rights to Titan Pharmaceuticals. Titan then handed over worldwide development, manufacturing and marketing rights to Novartis in August 1998. On June 9, 2004, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced that the Phase III development rights have been acquired by Vanda Pharmaceuticals. The original launch date was scheduled for 2002. On November 27, 2007, Vanda Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted their New Drug Application for iloperidone, confirming the application is ready for FDA review and approval. On July 28, 2008, the FDA issued a not-approvable letter to Vanda Pharmaceuticals concerning the drug, stating that further trials are required before a decision can be made concerning marketed usage of iloperidone. Iloperidone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States on May 6, 2009.

While it was ordered in small numbers for the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, it was not used operationally. It is one of the few quadruplane aircraft to reach production. Development The F.K.10 was designed in 1916 by Frederick Koolhoven,Mason 1992, p.76. the chief designer of Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft as a single-engine two-seat fighter. Koolhoven chose the novel quadruplane layout, also used by Pemberton-Billing (later known as Supermarine) for the P.B.29E and Supermarine Nighthawk anti-Zeppelin aircraft, and the contemporary Wight Quadruplane scout. At roughly the same time, Sopwith were building the successful Sopwith Triplane fighter. The first prototype, the F.K.9 Green and Swanborough 1994, p.25. was built and first flown in the summer of 1916, powered by a 110 hp (80 kW) Clerget 9Z rotary engine. It had a shallow fuselage, with the wings joined by plank-like interplane struts,Bruce 1965, p.11-12. similar to those used by the Sopwith Triplane. After evaluation at the Central Flying School in late 1916, a production order for 50 was placed by the RFC for a modified version, the F.K.10. The production F.K.10 had a new, deeper fuselage, and a new tail, but retained the wing planform of the F.K.9. The F.K.10 showed inferior performance to the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which was already in service as a successful two-seat fighter, and only five were built of the RFC order, with a further three built for the RNAS. They were not used operationally and the design was not developed further.Bruce 1965, p.13.

The series appeared on YouTube, Revver, iTunes and its own web site. The show revolved around its tagline, \\"Samantha Breslow has seven friends. On December 15, 2006, one of them will kill her,\\" with each episode bringing Sam one day closer to her death.  History  The series was created as an experiment by a group of young Los Angeles-based filmmakers – Douglas Cheney, Chris Hampel, Chris McCaleb, Ryan Wise, and producer Marqus Blakely – in their spare time. The project was on a budget of $50,000. Chris Hampel and Chris McCaleb were also working on Michael Mann's film Miami Vice, Hampel as Mann's assistant, McCaleb as an assistant editor. The group formed a production company called Big Fantastic and set about creating a series of webisodes. The producers believed there was an untapped market for people with short attention spans, or office workers with only sporadic free time, who would watch a short-form scripted, serialized drama. The series was distributed for free on YouTube, Revver, iTunes and its own site, samhas7friends.com. The series was produced with no business model, and only minimal support from advertising via post-roll Revver ads. Since the demise of Revver, all episodes and related content was moved over to Blip.TV which provided revenue to the producers by pre-roll ads until its demise in 2015.  Story  Sam Has 7 Friends is variously described as a soap opera or murder mystery. The story follows an attractive cast of young actors around LA with the knowledge, throughout the series, that one of them is going to kill Samantha Breslow, an aspiring actress. The seven \\"friends\\" that appear in the series opening credits are Sam's boyfriend Patrick, her ex-boyfriend Willie, her best friend Dani, Dani's boyfriend Chivo, her neighbor Scott, Patrick's other girlfriend Vera, and Sam's agent Roman. The characters get in various fights with each other over the course of the 80 episodes. With webisodes of only 90 seconds a piece, each episode focused on the most interesting minute and a half of the characters' days. Throughout the series, Sam has a bad run of luck, going through two break-ups, struggling to find acting work and getting in fights with her best friend, her agent and her sister. After attempting various reconciliations, she decides she has had her fill of LA On the December 15, 2006 episode Sam is murdered while preparing to move out of her apartment and leave L.A. forever. The murderer cannot be seen in this final episode, leaving the mystery up in the air. According to the last episode posted on YouTube on June 29, 2009, the answer would be revealed in Prom Queen: The Homecoming.  Reception  Critics had mixed reactions to Sam Has 7 Friends. Virginia Heffernan of the New York Times described the series as \\"respectably viral.\\" Television critic Andrew Wallenstein was perplexed by the series, and suggested that \\"maybe drama remains the domain of traditional mediums.\\" The series received small audiences of several thousand viewers at YouTube, Revver and its own site. At iTunes the show was more popular, receiving more than 10,000 downloads a day through the show's run.  After Sam's Death  While the show attracted 3 million views during its initial run, Sam Has 7 Friends caught the eye of the United Talent Agency, one of the \\"Big 5\\" Hollywood talent agencies, which operates a unit to scout for online talent. After shopping the series around, United Talent Agency and Big Fantastic caught the eye of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Walt Disney who was creating a studio to produce content for the internet. Eisner acquired the rights for Season 1 of Sam Has 7 Friends as well as an option to produce any future seasons. Through his new production company, Vuguru, Eisner funded the production of Big Fantastic's second series, Prom Queen. That series debuted on MySpace on April 1, 2007. In October 2012, both \\"Sam Has 7 Friends\\" and \\"Prom Queen\\" were relaunched on The CW's website.

We Walk the Path of Endless Fire is the fifth studio album by the German death metal band Fleshcrawl. This album is highly typical of Fleshcrawl's mid-to-late career material, and resembles contemporary work by such melodic/Swedish death metal bands as Dismember, Entombed, and Arch Enemy. It utilizes highly melodic and aerobically rhythmic mid-to-high guitar range with rapid tempos and short, highly agile guitar solos, and is consequently very characteristic of the Swedish-style Death metal sound that has dominated their work since the late 1990s. A slightly brutal sound present in the drumwork, which consists of very high-tempo double-bass drum rolls and the occasional blast beats, serves to accent the melodic death metal rhythmics of the album without creating a sense of disorganization and chaos, while the guttural, abrasive vocals, somewhat reminiscent of such bands as Six Feet Under and Deicide enhance the intensity of the album.

to Heaven, the sequel to Abeng (novel), is the second novel published by Jamaican-American author Michelle Cliff. The novel continues the story of Clare Savage, Cliff's semi-autobiographical character from Abeng, through a set of flashbacks that recount Clare's adolescence and young adulthood as she moves from Jamaica to the United States, then to England, and finally back to Jamaica. First published in 1987, the book has received attention for its articulation of the paradoxes of history and identity after, and counter to, the experience of colonization. Plot summary The novel begins with a small group of armed militants, a much older Clare Savage among them, traveling through Jamaica's remote Cockpit Country. The militants have settled on land once owned by Clare's grandmother Miss Mattie, where they train together and grow food as well as produce illegal drugs. The second chapter tells the story of Paul H., who is initially at a party with Harry/Harriet, a transgender half-brother/half-sister to one of Paul's friends. Paul returns home after a late night to find a horrific scene: his family and all of their servants have been murdered with a machete. He stumbles upon Christopher, another servant employed by Paul's parents, and enlists his help in dealing with the bodies and the burials. But we learn in flashback that Christopher, an orphan whose family has served Paul's parents for generations, committed the murders when he went to ask a favor from Paul's father—to help Christopher find where his grandmother is buried so that he could give her spirit rest—and was turned down. Christopher had been waiting for Paul, and kills him before Paul figures out what has happened. The story then shifts time periods to 1960, when Boy Savage, Clare's father, is immigrating with his family to the United States. Kitty Savage, Clare's mother, is not happy about moving away from all she has ever known, but she resigns herself to quiet depression upon departure from Jamaica and arrival in Miami. Boy purchases a used car and the family travels north to New York City. While traveling through the state of Georgia, Boy attempts to get a room in a segregated motel; the innkeeper suspects that he is black, but Boy is able to convince the innkeeper that he is white by telling him that his ancestors once owned plantations. When the family arrives in New York City they go to stay with Winston and Grace, relatives from Kitty's mother's side of the family. Soon, however, they stop any contact with Kitty's relatives in order to fully assume a white identity. Boy eventually takes a job driving a laundry truck and Kitty goes to work in the office of his employer. Fed up with the constant racism she encounters, Kitty decides to slip messages into the linens before they are delivered—messages such as “Marcus Garvey was right” and “America is cruel. Consider kindness for a change” aimed at the white customers. Mr. B, Kitty's employer, finds out about the messages and fires two of the black workers, Georgia and Virginia; Mr. B suspects that they were the ones slipping in the messages. Kitty quits her job, then takes Clare's younger sister Jennie and returns to Jamaica. After her mother and sister leave, Clare becomes increasingly lonely, since she has not yet started school and is not allowed to leave the house by herself. She stays home and watches movies and remembers the first American she met—a white teacher at her Catholic school in Jamaica who taught lessons on the American Civil War, took the girls to see the “documentary” Gone With the Wind, and extolled the benefits of racial hierarchies. When Clare begins school in New York she is told that, despite her intelligence, she will be held back for a year because children from Third World countries develop differently from American children. Boy tries to convince the school that Clare is white, but the school does not believe him, nor do they have a category for “bi-racial” students—a student is either black or white. Five years pass, and Kitty is still living with Clare's younger sister in Jamaica. Clare, who is now a sophomore in college, comes home one evening to find her father crying. He tells her that her mother has died and later that her sister Jennie will be coming to live with them. After Jennie moves in, Clare borrows some money from her uncle Fredrick and leaves home for England. Upon arriving in London Clare finds a room to rent and spends some time visiting various museums, browsing bookshops and generally getting to know England. She eventually becomes a legal resident and enrolls at the University of London to study art history. After some time at the university Clare decides to take her uncle up on his invitation to come back to Jamaica, where she attends the same party as Paul H. before he was killed by Christopher, and meets Harry/Harriet. Clare and Harry/Harriet become good friends while Clare is in Kingston, Jamaica, spending time together first in a Spanish galleon-themed bar and then on a beach discussing the history and current social conditions of Jamaica. The two keep in touch, via letters, after Clare returns to England. Upon her return, Clare witnesses a National Front march and is deeply disturbed by the aggression and racism on display on her college campus. She tries to explain why she is so disturbed to her friend Liz, but gets nowhere and ends up feeling isolated and alone. In the next chapter Clare meets up with Bobby, a Vietnam War veteran who has a wound on his ankle that, despite Clare's best efforts, will not heal. The two of them leave London together and travel around Europe. While traveling she receives a letter from Harry/Harriet telling her that her aunt and uncle in Kingston are moving to Miami and leaving her grandmother's old place in the country to her alone. Clare continues to travel around Europe with Bobby, who is still struggling mentally and physically with the after-effects of the war, until one day he disappears without warning. Clare waits for Bobby but eventually decides it is time for her to return to Jamaica. Clare becomes increasingly ill upon her return and discovers that she has an infection in her womb that will most likely leave her sterile. After she recovers, Harry/Harriet suggests that the two of them travel to Clare's grandmother's farm. Once there, Clare finds the river where she used to bathe and with Harry/Harriet takes a bath there for the first time in twenty years. In chapter nine we learn that Christopher was never arrested for his crime, and so has been left to wander the back alleys of Kingston's ghettos. He becomes known throughout the city as the watchman of Kingston—a sort of mad prophet or mendicant, and becomes the subject of a reggae song. On the night of a terrible fire where many old women are burned alive, alluded to earlier in a letter from Harry/Harriet to Clare, Christopher shows up at the scene shouting prophecies at the top of his lungs. After visiting the countryside Clare learns of the poor economic conditions in Jamaica. Harry/Harriet takes her to a small tenement room in Kingston so that she can join a clandestine militant revolutionary group. She is interrogated about her motives and convinces the militants that she is genuine in her desire to make a violent revolution on behalf of the poor and oppressed in Jamaica. In her answers Clare connects the experiences of her life and travels to the oppressed condition of Jamaica—a former colony, part of the Third World. Finally, Clare recalls that in one of her final letters before her death, her mother told her to help her people in whatever way that she could; this becomes her ultimate justification for joining the group. In the final chapter of the book, a film crew has come to Jamaica to make a movie about the Maroons, and they have hired Christopher, “de Watchman”, to play a small role. Clare and the militants decide to massacre the civilian crew, but when they begin their attack it is apparent that someone has sold them out. Clare and the rest of the militants are killed in a counter-terrorism operation. Main characters *Clare Savage: protagonist, light-skinned, Jamaican; the character of whom the novel revolves around; eventually takes part in a guerrilla movementLacerda, Irene Nicácio. “Home and Abroad: Identifications and Identities in Michelle Cliff’s No Telephone to Heaven.” Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 2009. *Kitty Savage: Clare's mother, slightly darker complexion, has a deep love for Jamaica *Boy Savage: Clare's father, has very light skin (can pass as white), proudly proclaims his British heritage *Jennie Savage: Clare's younger sister, has a complexion closer to her mother's *Fredrick: Clare's uncle, Kitty's brother, helps Clare travel to London and support herself once at the university *Harry/Harriet: transgender, Clare's close friend, encourages her to come to Jamaica and helps her join the revolutionaries *Christopher, aka “De Watchman”: servant, or “yardboy”, who kills his employers, legendary figure in Kingston folklore, hired by the film crew to play a small role in their movie *Bobby: black Vietnam veteran, travels around Europe with Clare, has a wound on his ankle that will not heal Themes Identity Cliff offers a complex rendering of identity in the novel. The character of Clare Savage is in some sense the embodiment of various conflicting identities involving race and class. From her father she has inherited a “white,” upper-class, distinctly metropolitan identity, while her mother and maternal grandmother represent almost the opposite—a rural working-class Afro-Creole identity. Clare is not so much the product of these familial histories as she is the representation of their collision inside one mind and body. She is all of them at once, not a mixture of the various constituent parts, as she recounts during her interrogation by the leader of the revolutionaries. Clare ultimately chooses to forge an identity counter to that of her father by recognizing and embracing her Jamaican heritage.No Telephone to Heaven, Cliff, pg. 91 Many other characters have conflicting or contradictory identities as well. Christopher's loyalty to and hatred for his employers is another example; he is caught between the need to occupy a subservient identity to keep his job and the need to take care of his grandmother, to play the role of grandson. The two identities, which could be read as conflicting class identities, collide and create a disastrous outcome. Harry/Harriet is another example of a character with multiple identities. Like Clare, Harry/Harriet does not attempt to become a woman or to be fully a man; she/he is \\"not just sun, but sun and moon\\".No Telephone to Heaven, Cliff, pg. 128 Instead, she/heNo Telephone to Heaven, Cliff recognizes the existence of both genders within him/herself and it is this dual existence that he/she expresses outwardly to the world with his/her appearance. It seems then that Cliff conceptualizes identity as an innately plural, as opposed to singular, phenomenon. History The history of British colonialism in Jamaica is an important part of the novel. It is sometimes raised explicitly—as in Clare and Harry/Harriet's discussions—but it is always in the background of the novel, forming the texture of the ground over which the characters travel. The dominant historical narrative of Jamaica and Jamaican identity is told from a Eurocentric and colonial perspective. Clare's experiences and internal conflicts become a way of recovering Caribbean history, a \\"history erased by colonial fables.\\"http://seas3.elte.hu/anachronist/2008Croisy.pdf At the end of Abeng, Clare begins to reconsider her place in Jamaican society, the relation between her personal and familial history and the history of colonial class and racial class oppression in Jamaica. The narrative of No Telephone to Heaven can be seen to carry that process through to a sort of conclusion. Whereas in Abeng, Clare tries to figure out a way of knowing and understanding history that is not exclusive or oppressive, in No Telephone to Heaven she is trying to figure out a way to act on her knowledge of history—particularly the sequences of Jamaica's colonial history, in which slavery, colonization, and subsequently a Third World, underdeveloped status determine the position of Jamaica today, as Belinda Edmondson notes (185-186). The problem of historical action is perhaps articulated most powerfully in the terrorists' doomed attack on the civilian film crew who are making a movie about the Maroons (featuring Cudjoe and Nanny Granny, two important figures from Jamaican history and Afro- Creole folklore). When the terrorists attack the crew, they are metaphorically attacking Jamaica's mainstream narrative and trying to impose their alternative historical narrative at any cost. Migration Clare travels often in the novel. First with her family she immigrates to the United States, and then studies in London before returning to Jamaica. As Clare moves between countries she in some sense rehearses the movements of slavery and colonialism. Just as goods and people moved from the Caribbean to the US and then on to England during slavery's heyday, Clare travels between the three countries in an effort to discover more about herself and her family. Instead of staying in England and Europe, however, she eventually returns to Jamaica. No matter where Clare is, when she is not in Jamaica she feels she is never really at “home.” When she is in England she realizes that the version of London that she learned about in school is far from accurate, and this only increases her sense of isolation—a fact highlighted by her friendship with Liz in England, who cannot understand why Clare is so angry about a National Front march (138-140). Clare's movements, and the historical echoes of her trajectory, determine her search for identity. It is only after she realizes that England is not the paradise that it seemed when she was in school that she can return to Jamaica—only after the myth of England as the center of the world is shattered is she able to realize that Jamaica is in fact the center of her world. Cliff does not seem to approach any of these themes as distinct. Instead they are all presented as related, although at times in a contradictory manner (O’Driscoll 57). Even the three major foci of the novel are not as distinct as they may initially appear; Cliff goes to great lengths to highlight how history and identity are connected, and how migration is an historical phenomenon with far-reaching effects on contemporary identity. All the concerns of the novel can be read as linked to colonialism and post- colonialism, for both colonization and decolonization have had far-reaching impacts on every aspect of Jamaican history. The novel assesses the relationship between colonial and post-colonial Jamaica by exploring the various ways in which colonization and decolonization have shaped what it means to be Jamaican.

Overview These fresh water snails are present in aquariums and ponds, as well as in wild areas. They are commonly referred to as tadpole snails or pouch snails. They eat algae, diatoms and detritus including dead leaves. The populations are regulated by the abundance of food and space. They are widespread, abundant, and tolerant to pollution. These snails are common in the North Temperate to Arctic Zones and throughout the Americas, in readily accessible habitats such as ditches, ponds, lakes, small streams, and rivers. The family has been recognized since the 19th century, and yet there has been no classification in which relationships between genera are clarified, no agreement on what characters are primitive or advanced, and no consistent ranking. Scarcity of careful morphological studies is the principal cause. The differences in the group have led to the creation of more than 23 genera, four grades and four clades within the family. The two established subfamilies are divided into seven new tribes including 11 new genera.http://www.ots.ac.cr/tropiweb/attachments/suppls/sup51-1%20Physidae/Physidae%20Information.pdf Within this family, the shell is always sinistral, in other words it has left- handed coiling. Physidae has 23 genera, 17 occur in Pacific drainages of North and Central America, eight of these restricted to the region. Concentration of primitive genera along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Costa Rica conforms to previous observations that primitive pulmonate families are concentrated within, or along the continental margins of, the Pacific Ocean. An ancestral origin of Physidae along an ancient eastern Pacific coast is probable. From this region the several lineages have spread to north, south and east in the Americas, and through Siberia to Europe. Ecology These small snails are quite distinctive, because they have shells that are sinistral, which means that if the shell is held such that the spire is pointing up and the aperture is facing the observer, then the aperture is on the left-hand side. The shells of Physidae species have a long and large aperture, a pointed spire, and no operculum. The shells are thin and corneous, and rather transparent. The Physidae, sinistral pond snails. Studies in 1982 indicate that they are most abundant in the New World. They have evidently found a shell morphology suitable for their life station, as he goes on to say \\"...the physids have undergone considerable diversification, much of which is not clearly exhibited in their shells. Many of the species, and genera, are not easy to identify on shell characters alone.\\" They have been used in studies of ecophenotypic plasticity, a so-called phenoplastic switch. Burt Vaughan of Washington State University indicates several studies in M. J. West-Eberhardt's recent compendium of research, \\"Developmental Plasticity & Evolution\\" (Oxford Press, 2003, pp. 307–362).http://mkohl1.net/Physidae.html A typical example involved rearing Physa gyrina, or Physa heterostropha in controlled pair groups in either water in which crayfish co-existed or water in which only fish co- existed. Within a month, differences in shell morphology appeared; i.e., snails exposed to shell-crushing fish predators showed wide apertures and very much strengthened, rotund shells. Snails exposed to crayfish only showed narrow-apertured, thin elongate shells, with barricading teeth. In 1921, the strong reaction of Physa to contact with leeches was first observed, and later studies have also been made. The observations are restricted to Physa fontinalis, an indigenous species to areas with indigenous predatory leeches, and Haitia acuta, introduced in Germany and the Netherlands. When Physa contacts another snail, either Physa or some other kind, the reaction is a rapid twisting of the shell back and forth to dislodge the other. The muscle used is the \\"physid muscle\\", not found in other Hygrophila, which therefore do not show this reaction. The leech-avoidance reaction carries the action one step further: on contact with a leech the snail twists its shell violently and detaches its foot from the substratum as well. The reaction of two species of Physids to various species of leeches and to various salts was studied. In Haitia acute, the avoidance reaction was much less pronounced than in Physa fontinalis. The highest percentage of reactions in Physa were obtained with the two species of leeches that feed chiefly on snails. The nature of the substance that produces the reaction is undetermined, but presumably it is a protein. Taxonomy According to ITIS and WoRMS, this family is classified into 4 genera, although the 4 genera from each database has a little bit difference. The classification from the taxonomy by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), which is based on classification by Taylor (2003):Taylor D. W. (2003). \\"Introduction to Physidae (Gastropoda: Hygrophila). Biology, classification, morphology\\". Revista de Biología Tropical 51(Suppl. 1): 1-299. (1-195) 197-263, 265-287). Taylor classifies Physidae according to the anatomical differences of their penis, the differences among the penial complex, penial sheath and preputium. Thus, the Physidae is classified into two subfamilies, four grades and seven tribes. *subfamily Physinae Fitzinger, 1833: Preputial gland present ** tribe Haitiini D.W.

These snails are sometimes viewed as pests in aquarium tanks with fish, because the snails create waste, reproduce very often, and are very hard to remove completely. However, some aquarium owners deliberately chose to add these freshwater pond snails to their tank because the snails will eat uneaten fish food, algae and waste, as well as unwanted fish carcasses.

He was a painter, muralist, printmaker, and illustrator. When Delsarte was growing up, he was surrounded by music including jazz, opera, musicals, and the blues. From this experience, as well as from his knowledge of African history and culture, he has drawn much of the inspiration for his art. Delsarte was a professor of Fine Arts at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. For the past 13 years his work has been exhibited around the United States. Education, exhibitions, and critical recognition Born in Brooklyn, Delsarte went to high school in Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY, received a Certificate in Fine Arts Education from Brooklyn College, earned his bachelor's degree in Fine Arts at New York's Pratt Institute, and obtained a master's degree in Fine Arts at the University of Arizona. Delsarte's work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions at museums, galleries, and other venues throughout the United States, including the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, the Bodley Gallery (also in New York), the California Afro- American Museum, the Camille Hanks Cosby Museum at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Howard University fine arts gallery. In 2001, Delsarte's work was included as part of a national traveling exhibition entitled \\"When the Spirit Moves: African-American Dance in History and Art\\". The traveling exhibition was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, having originated as a 1999-2000 exhibition at Spelman College (entitled \\"When the Spirit Moves: African American Art Inspired by Dance\\". In 2001, Delsarte completed a large public mural commissioned by the city of New York. The monumental work, entitled \\"Transitions\\", is located at the Church Avenue station, on the Brooklyn IRT line. Delsarte received further national recognition in August 2005 when the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring a Delsarte painting. The stamp depicts the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, taken from a Delsarte painting created in 2000. Also in 2005, Delsarte completed another monumental public mural, this one entitled \\"Spirit of Harlem\\". The 30 ft X 11 ft glass mosaic was assembled in Munich, Germany, and is located at North Fork Bank on 125th Street in New York City. In January 2010, Delsarte's 125-foot-long Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Mural was dedicated at Peace Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. Significant critical recognition of Delsarte's contribution to American art has included discussion of his work in Samella Lewis's African American Art & Artists: a history of African American art from the seventeenth-century to the 1990sSamella Lewis African American Art & Artists: a history of African American art from the seventeenth-century to the 1990s University of California, Berkeley, 1990, 302 pp. His painting \\"Greenwood Lake\\", inspired by summers spent at Greenwood Forest Farms, where Langston Hughes also lived for a time, was made into an oversized 6'6\\" square panel for inclusion in the Greenwood Lake Mural Project by curator Melanie Gold. It can be viewed by the general public at 673 Jersey Ave in Greenwood Lake, NY. The project also includes works by other artists, and was featured in a New York Times articlehttps://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/nyregion/17towns.html?_r=2&ref;=ourtowns& Style and technique: a synthesis of chaotic abstraction and disciplined figuration Delsarte's paintings are generally figurative and notable for their complex, layered look, enlivened with rapidly executed strokes in strong colors, as Adrienne Klein notes in an interview with the artist available online at the Union College website. Delsarte describes how he often creates a painting \\"over 10 to 12 sessions\\", sometimes laying the canvas on the floor and applying colors from every direction, \\"without even looking at the drawn image.\\" Next, he allows the paint to dry and then works on the canvas vertically again for another phase of \\"disciplined drawing\\" — often going back to the floor for yet more work \\"when they [the images] have become too literal\\". Thus, Delsarte's technique reflects a concern for synthesizing the chaotic, unpredictable, irrational aspects of art-making with the tradition of making disciplined, representational images. Klein draws a connection between these stylistic and technical features, taken together, and the influence of music on the artist's work: \\"In his paintings, the relationship between the figure and ground – the painted space outside of the figure – shifts and alters. The patterned liveliness of this space draws our eye and suggests the enveloping sound of music. The figures are woven into this vibrant atmosphere.\\" He died May 2nd, 2020.

The main goal of the Robinsonade game is to survive on a dangerous island and to find a way to return home. The game is free to download and play. The second installment of the game was released under the CC BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license with its source code. History Stranded was released in mid-2003 by Peter Schauß, the founder of Unreal Software. Its design and gameplay are influenced by the relatively unknown German freeware game Schiffbruch. Stranded was a success in November 2003, appearing in four different German gaming magazines and the Rhein-Zeitung. After release of Version 1.3 development ceased, and the Stranded source code was released, but without any license information given, thus leaving all copyrights still on Peter Schauß. Gameplay The game has no campaign mode, but its \\"random island\\" mode is wrapped up in a story where the player is stranded on a deserted island. Resource management is a vital component of gameplay, since the player character has a constant need for food and water, and has to sleep. The game features a day and night cycle. Sleeping in the open injures the player, unprocessed food is not very effective against hunger and aggressive animals threaten the player. So the player is forced to gather resources like branches, stones and vines to construct tools, buildings and weapons. Each building that is finished will unlock another, more sophisticated building, until the player is able to build a raft to escape from the island and reach his homeland. The terrain in the game is completely modifiable. There are also some mini-missions such as rescuing kiwi birds or fighting off a pack of blood-thirsty raptors under a time limit. Such custom maps can be created with the built-in map editor. Several of these fan-made maps can be downloaded from the Stranded home page. Although there are some limited settings, such as turning off the need for food, water and sleep, any way of story-telling is limited to a single briefing message after the map has started and creative terrain design. Stranded II Peter Schauß started work on the sequel Stranded II in late 2003. Development entered public alpha stage in December 2005. But still, the release of the final version didn't happen until June 2007. Stranded II had improved visuals and much more features than its predecessor, and was built with ease of modding in mind. Stranded 3 As of 2012, Peter Schauß has started working on another sequel, Stranded III. There will be multiplayer support which will be a part of the Unreal Software Gaming Network (U.S.G.N.) which is already being used for Counter Strike 2D and Carnage Contest. There is no mobile version planned but there are possibilities that once the PC version is launched mobile development will take place.

The longest field goal of his college career, a 52-yarder, came in 2005 against USC. During his sophomore year, he also took over the punting duties in addition to his kicking duties. He earned All-Pac-10 honors as a senior. He finished his college career after making 30-of-47 field goals, 79-of-81 extra points, and 96 punts for 4,242 yards (44.2 avg.), including a long of 61 yards. Professional career Dallas Cowboys alt=A football player =2007 season= Folk was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (178th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. Folk made the longest kick of his career to that point, a 53-yard game winner against the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football during his rookie season. That season, he became the first Cowboys rookie Pro Bowl kicker, after being selected to serve as the NFC's kicker during the 2008 Pro Bowl, having gone 26-of-31 in field goal attempts and making all 53 extra points he attempted during the season. Folk also broke the Cowboys single-season record for most points by a placekicker (131) during his rookie season. =2008 season= In 2008, Folk continued his strong performance as he made 91% of his kicks and once again made all of his extra point attempts. Following the 2008 season, Folk discovered a problem with his hip that the Cowboys medical personnel diagnosed in his flexor, but it did not heal with the prescribed treatment. After conducting more tests, it was discovered that Folk had a torn labrum and underwent surgery in May 2009. The normal recovery period would have had Folk returning near the beginning of training camp but Folk rushed his rehab and as a result, the hip did not heal properly. =2009 season= Folk struggled as he entered his third season with the Cowboys in 2009. His performance was erratic, evidenced by the fact that he only made 64.3% of his field goals, converting 18 out of 28 opportunities. On December 19, 2009, Folk attempted a 23-yard field goal against the New Orleans Saints that would have increased the Cowboys lead to ten points; earlier in the game, he had successfully kicked a 51-yard field goal. However, he missed as the ball hit the goal post. Although the Cowboys won the game, the team lost faith in Folk and he was waived on December 21, and was replaced by Shaun Suisham. New York Jets =2010 season= On February 23, Folk signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets. Head coach Rex Ryan mocked Folk's early performances during the team's offseason workouts; however, after working out with special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff, who helped refine Folk's kicking technique after allowing his hip to fully recover, Folk began to gain consistency once again. On October 11, Folk became the first Jets kicker to kick five field goals in a home game since Pat Leahy achieved the feat in 1984. Folk set a franchise record for the longest kick, making a career long kick of 56 yards against the Denver Broncos on October 17. During the 2010 season, Folk converted 30 field goals out of 39 opportunities.

In Week 5, Folk kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in a 30–28 win at the Atlanta Falcons. During an AFC East rivalry game against the New England Patriots in Week 7, Folk kicked another gaming-winning field goal to give the Jets a 30–27 overtime victory. Folk's career-high and Jets record of 23 consecutive field goals made was snapped after missing from 48 yards during a 37–14 loss against the Bills. He established a franchise record in field goal percentage (91.7), after making 33-of-36 field goal attempts and his 23 consecutive field goals also ranked second in Jets history. =2014 season= Set to become a free agent during the 2014 offseason, it was announced on February 28, 2014, that the Jets had placed the franchise tag on Folk. On March 10, it was announced that Folk had signed a 4-year, $12 million contract. He led the league in field goal attempts (39), tied for third in field goals made (32), and set a franchise record for the longest field goal made at home (55-yards). =2015 season= In pregame warm-ups against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he suffered a season-ending quad injury.

It was originally performed by the Super Golden Chimes with Wijewardene at vocals in the mid-1970s. The lyrics of the song present a prayer of praise to the god Kataragama in the point of view of a pilgrim visiting the shrine in the Sri Lankan city of the same name; the hook translates to \\"I have come to worship you, I have come to see you.\\" Despite the religious lyrics, the song's melody is festive and secular, in the style of Sri Lankan baila. The song goes in the 6/8 beat. It speeds up at the end near to the tempo of a kavadi dance. The song was inspired by the practice of Kavadi dancing at the Kataragama temple. 'Kanda Surinduni' went on to become a huge hit over the airwaves of Radio Ceylon in South Asia. The song was played by the legendary Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Vernon Corea on his radio programmes on the English Services of the station and in 1976 on his popular BBC radio programme London Sounds Eastern on BBC Radio London.

Strathcona was the heart of the City of Strathcona and still is today (although a part of Edmonton) in many cases. According to the 2001 federal census, 15% of residences were built before 1946. Over half the residences (52.6%) were built during the 1960s and 1970s.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/DD23/FEDERAL%202001/Neighbourhood/STRATHCONA.pdf This is mainly due to a large amount of construction of low-rise apartments near or on Whyte Avenue and 99 St, and high-rise apartments around Saskatchewan Drive in the 1960s, 70s, and 1980s. Despite that, the area, especially around Mill Creek or just off 99 St is still home to a lot of old genuine character homes. Although the number is dwindling due to new infill housing.

The lands are immediately south of 86 Avenue and beside the former CPR lands (rail property now owned by the Province of Alberta and leased to the Radial Rail Society). Specifically, Lots 22 to 32 were designated for the purpose of community garden and transferred from Asset Management to Parks. Previous leaseholders from the site who had been gardening there for up to 20 years were invited to be involved in the new community garden and were given first choice of the plots in the new community garden. Plots are open to residents of Strathcona, Queen Alexandra and Garneau. In 2014, the garden applied to the city to take back the gravel-covered lane adjacent to the garden which had been used as a thoroughfare for several years, but which did not belong to Transportation. After a hearing in front of city council and a couple of public meetings where parking concerns were addressed, a plan for reclaiming the area was developed and implemented. Raised beds were added to enlarge the garden by three members with the potential to accept more gardeners in 2015.  Population mobility  The population in Strathcona is highly mobile. According to the 2005 municipal census, almost three out of every ten residents (28.2%) had moved within the previous 12 months.

She spent a year in a psychiatric ward at a hospital in Opařany, and later worked at various jobs but was usually fired shortly after being hired, including when she was trained as a bookbinder in Prague and then worked in Cheb for a year before returning to Prague. She ended up working as a truck driver. Gradually she lost contact with her family, especially her father and older sister. She bought a cabin that she had brought to the village of Oleško, from where she commuted to work. She later sold the cabin and bought a Trabant car with the money she had received. During her teenage years she struggled with her vague sexuality. From the age of 17 she had sexual relations with both men and women. She described herself as a \\"sexual cripple\\".  Arson attack  Hepnarová’s father inherited a farm in the village of Zábrodí, which the family used for recreation. On the morning of 7 August 1970, using a bottle of gasoline, Hepnarová set fire to the door in the living area of the building. She hoped that the fire would reach the hayloft via a dormer and destroy the homestead. Her sister and two tenants - a married couple over the age of 75 - were asleep in the house at the time. They woke up and managed to extinguish the fire in time. The final damage was only 50 Kcs. Hepnarová was not suspected of the crime. She had approached the farm on foot at night after taking a taxi from Náchod. She confessed to the act during a psychiatric examination in 1973. As a motive, she stated that the property had become the cause of money disputes between her parents.  Truck attack  Strossmayer Square with a tram stop in the foreground Hepnarová began planning the truck attack about six months in advance. She believed all people were trying to hurt her. She said that she had been beaten up on the street for no reason, and no one helped her. She refused to become an unknown suicide, and wanted to be remembered. Her original plans included derailment of an express train or detonation of an explosive in a room full of people, but she decided that these were too technically demanding and instead decided on a mass shooting: she planned to obtain an automatic firearm and fire on people on Wenceslas Square. She enrolled in the shooting ring at the . But she changed her mind about this option also: she was afraid that she might be immediately killed, and finding such a weapon also seemed difficult. Eventually she decided to use a vehicle as her weapon. From 11 January to 10 July 1973, Hepnarová lived in room 502 in what is now Penzion Malešice, which served as a hostel for the Prague Communications business. On 9 July, she left for a last look at her cottage, and then abandoned her Trabant car, to which she was strongly attached. The next day, on 10 July, she successfully completed a test drive to demonstrate that she was able to control the specific type of truck she wanted to rent. At 1:30 p.m., Hepnarová drove her Praga RN truck from the Defenders' of Peace (today Milada Horáková) to the Strossmayer Square (Strossmayerovo náměstí) in the Prague 7 district, where she drove her truck onto the sidewalk and into a group of about 25 people who were waiting for a tram. After the vehicle spontaneously stopped, witnesses tried to help her because they thought she had lost control of the vehicle due to a technical defect. However, Hepnarová immediately admitted that she had intentionally rammed into the crowd. Three people died immediately, three more died later the same day, two within a few days (all aged from 60 to 79), and 12 people were injured but survived. Before the attack, Hepnarová had sent a letter to two newspapers, Svobodné slovo and Mladý svět, explaining her actions as revenge for the hatred she felt was directed against her by her family and the world. The letter was received two days after the murder.  Arrest and conviction  During the investigation, Hepnarová confirmed her intention was to kill as many people as possible. Psychology experts found her fully aware of her actions, and she expressed no regret. She planned her actions, as she took into account that the ground sloped down to the tram stop, which allowed her to gain speed for the maximum death toll. The attack was her second attempt, as she felt there were not enough people on her first run. On 6 April 1974, Hepnarová was sentenced to death for murder by the City Court. The sentence was affirmed by higher instance courts and the Supreme Court re-qualified the sentence to public endangerment with the same penalty to be upheld. After several psychiatric examinations Hepnarová was deemed criminally responsible for her actions, and the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, Lubomír Štrougal, refused to grant her a pardon.  Execution  Hepnarová was executed by short-drop hanging on 12 March 1975 at Pankrác Prison in Prague. She was the last woman executed in Czechoslovakia, and one of the last by the use of short-drop hanging.Events of the execution day Literature In 1991, Bohumil Hrabal published Ponorné říčky, in which he describes a fictional confession of an executioner from Pankrác, for whom the execution of a beautiful lady called Olga was a life-changing moment that made him completely disgusted by his job and an opponent of the death sentence. Oprátka za osm mrtvých by Roman Cílek (2001) is about Hepnarová, and contains a collection of contemporary documents. Film I, Olga Hepnarová () is a 2016 Czech-Polish drama film directed by Tomáš Weinreb and Petr Kazda. It was shown in the Panorama section at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival.

Like all photoautotrophs, retinalophototrophs absorb photons to initiate their cellular processes. However, unlike all photoautotrophs, retinalophototrophs do not use chlorophyll or an electron transport chain to power their chemical reactions. This means retinalophototrophs are incapable of traditional carbon fixation, a fundamental photosynthetic process that transforms inorganic carbon (carbon contained in molecular compounds like carbon dioxide) into organic compounds. For this reason, experts consider them to be less efficient than their photoautotrophic counterparts, chlorophototrophs.  Energy conversion  Retinalophototrophs achieve adequate energy conversion via a proton-motive force. In retinalophototrophs, proton-motive force is generated from rhodopsin-like proteins, primarily bacteriorhodopsin and proteorhodopsin, acting as proton pumps along a cellular membrane. To capture photons needed for activating a protein pump, retinalophototrophs employ organic pigments known as carotenoids, namely beta-carotenoids. Beta-carotenoids present in retinalophototrophs are unusual candidates for energy conversion, but they possess high Vitamin-A activity necessary for retinaldehyde, or retinal, formation. Retinal, a chromophore molecule configured from Vitamin A, is formed when bonds between carotenoids are disrupted in a process called cleavage. Due to its acute light sensitivity, retinal is ideal for activation of proton-motive force and imparts a unique purple coloration to retinalophototrophs. Once retinal absorbs enough light, it isomerizes, thereby forcing a conformational (i.e., structural) change among the covalent bonds of the rhodopsin-like proteins. Upon activation, these proteins mimic a gateway, allowing passage of ions to create an electrochemical gradient between the interior and exterior of the cellular membrane. Ions diffusing outwards across the gradient through proton pumps are then bound to ATP synthase proteins on the cell’s surface. As they diffuse back into the cell, their protons catalyze the creation of ATP (from ADP and a phosphorus ion), providing energy for retinalophototrophic self-sustenance and proliferation.  Taxonomy  Retinalophototrophs are found across all domains of life but predominantly in the Bacteria and Archaea taxonomic groups. Scientists believe retinalophototroph’s general ecological abundance correlates to horizontal, or lateral, gene transfer since only two genes are required for retinalophototrophy to occur: essentially, one gene for retinal-binding protein synthesis (bop) and one for retinal chromophore synthesis (blh).  Interactions with environment  Despite their apparent simplicity, retinalophototrophs boast versatile ion usage that translates to their existence in relatively extreme environments. For instance, retinalophototrophs can thrive at depths over 200 meters where, despite a lack of inorganic carbon, sufficient light as well as sodium, hydrogen, or chloride concentrations harbor conditions capable of supporting their vital metabolic processes. Studies have also shown sodium and hydrogen ions correlate directly with retinalophototroph’s nutrient uptake and ATP synthesis, while chloride drives processes responsible for osmotic equilibrium. Even though retinalophototrophs are widespread, research has shown they can be niche too. Depending on their proximity to the oceans surface, retinalophototrophs have evolved to be better at absorbing light within specific wavelengths. Most importantly, retinalophototrophs prevalence as a primary producer contributes substantially to the bottom-up mechanics of marine environments and, consequently, success of fauna and flora worldwide.

Located in the Nord department, its Flemish name is Katsberg. The hill is seat of the Mont des Cats abbey,Abbaye du Mont des Cats famous for its cheese produced by monks since 1890. Mont des Cats as viewed from the town of Steenvoorde. Atop the hill rests an antenna that reaches a height of 364m and transmits both television and radio signals: * it emits FM radio signals at 500 W * and has 3 x UHF 80kW emitters for television broadcasting The antenna provides radio and television for part of the Nord Pas de Calais digital television (DTT). The traditional feast of Saint-Hubert is held atop this hill on the third Sunday in October.  Origin of the name  The name has nothing to do with cats, but is derived from the name of a Germanic tribe known as Chatti (French: Chattes; Dutch; Chatten), living in the area after the fall of the Roman Empire (5th century).History of Mont des Cats on abbey website  Mont des Cats Abbey  The Mont des Cats abbey A first community of the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony was settled in 1650 and lasted until the French Revolution which closed the monastery in 1792. In 1826, a new community of Trappists (Reformed Cistercians) was funded, and this congregation has run the abbey ever since. A breakaway group of Trappist monks left Mont des Cats and settled in Westvleteren (Belgium). Mont des Cats cheese  Mont des Cats cheese  Mont des Cats cheese has been produced by the monks since 1890 with the milk of local farms, in a small independent dairy. The production method are similar to those used for Port-salut. Affinage (maturing) takes a minimum of one month and during this period the cheese is washed in salted water and dyed with roucou, a reddish derivative from annatto seeds. The texture of the cheese is firm, uncooked, pressed and has small holes. The fat content is 50%. In Flanders it is sometimes eaten as a breakfast cheese with coffee.  Cycling  The Mont des Cats is regularly included in cycling races in spring, such as Gent–Wevelgem and the Four Days of Dunkirk. It featured once in the Tour de France.

History  Evidence of 7th century Slavic settlement has been found on the steep slope of the Danube valley. In addition, place and field names with Slavic roots are common in the area. At the beginning of the 9th century, Emperor Charlemagne donated the territory of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Michael in Metten. The first documentary mention of \\"Rosseza\\" dates to about 985. From the 11th century, the place was owned by the Babenbergs and was expanded into the 13th century. In 1258, a judge is mentioned in a document. As a result, various sacred and secular lordships had possessions in Rossatz. In the 15th century, Emperor Frederick III granted Rossatz market rights. From the early 16th century until about 1630, Rossatz was Protestant. After that date, the Counter-Reformation reinstated the Catholic Church. From the 15th century, the place changed hands often; for example, the Wallsee family, the families of Spaur and Kirchberger, and also Geymann of Gallspach. In 1768, Rossatz was united with the Lordship of Mautern owned by Count Schönborn-Puchheim. Since about 1170, there are documented evidence of viticulture in the area. After purchase of the former noble plots, there was founded the Rossatz forest and estate cooperative in 1859. The current agricultural community produces several varieties of Wachau wine. In both 1626 and 1886, Rossatz was devastated by fires.  Possessions of the Prince-Bishop of Salzburg  Almost 9 km up the Danube, the small villages of Bach-, Ober- und Mitter-Arnsdorf belonged to the Prince-Bishop of Salzburg from its foundation in 860. It was mediatized to Austria by order of the Final Recess of the Extraordinary Imperial Delegation (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss) in 1803. In 1971/72, the municipalities Mitter- and Oberarnsdorf were incorporated with Rossatz.  Municipal subdivisions  The borough incorporates the following nine villages (in brackets the population as at 1 Jan 2015Statistik Austria, population on 1.1.2015 by village): * Bacharnsdorf (36) * Hofarnsdorf (79) * Mitterarnsdorf (164) * Oberarnsdorf (188) * Rossatz (354) * Rossatzbach (84) * Rührsdorf (111) * Sankt Johann im Mauerthale (2) * Sankt Lorenz (15) The borough comprises the cadastral municipalities of Mitterarnsdorf, Oberarnsdorf, Rossatz and Rührsdorf.

United States and Okanogan, Methow, San Poelis, Nespelem, Colville, and Lake Indian Tribes v. United States), 279 U.S. 655 (1929), was a 1929 United States Supreme Court decision which interpreted the Constitutional provisions regarding the pocket veto. Background The Presentment Clause of Article I of the US Constitution states that a bill that the President has not signed and not vetoed becomes law ten days (not including Sundays) after being sent to the President \\"unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\\" The action of the President allowing a bill to expire without signing it after the adjournment of Congress is known as a pocket veto. The pocket veto had been used by Presidents starting with James Madison. In 1926, the United States Congress passed Senate Bill 3185, allowing American Indians in Washington state to sue for damages from the loss of their tribal lands. On June 24, 1926, the bill was sent to President Calvin Coolidge for him to sign or veto. Congress adjourned for the summer on July 3. After July 6, the tenth day after the bill's passage, it had received neither a presidential signature nor veto. Several Indian tribes (the Okanogan, Methow, Sanpoil, Nespelem, Colville, and the Lake Indian Tribes) filed suit in the United States Court of Claims, which ruled that their case had no legal merit. The Indian tribes appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Arguing on behalf of the United States, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell argued that the pocket veto was a long-established practice that had been used to decide many important cases. The case was argued on March 11, 1929 and was decided on May 27, 1929. The case hinged on the definition of \\"adjournment,\\" in Article I. Decision In a 9–0 decision, the court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The decision, written by Justice Edward Terry Sanford, noted that adjournment should be interpreted broadly, to mean any cessation of congressional legislative activity.

It was dissolved on 10 October 2010. After dissolution, the \\"BES islands\\" of the Dutch Caribbean — Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba — became the Caribbean Netherlands, \\"special municipalities\\" of the Netherlands proper — a structure that only exists in the Caribbean. Meanwhile Curaçao and Sint Maarten became constituent countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along the lines of Aruba, which separated from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986. History Map of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands and the Caribbean islands are to the same scale. The idea of the Netherlands Antilles as a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands never enjoyed the full support of all islands, and political relations between islands were often strained. Geographically, the Leeward Antilles islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire, and the Leeward Islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten lie almost apart. Culturally, the Leeward Antilles have deep connections with the South American mainland, especially Venezuela, and its population speaks a Portuguese-Dutch creole language called Papiamento; the other three islands are part of the English- speaking Caribbean. When the new constitutional relationship between the Netherlands and its former West Indian colonies was enshrined in the Kingdom Charter of 1954, the colonial administrative division of the Netherlands Antilles, which was derived from the colony of Curaçao and Dependencies and grouped all six Caribbean islands together under one administration, was taken for granted. Despite the fact that Aruban calls for secession from the Netherlands Antilles originated in the 1930s,Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 175 the governments of the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles did everything in their power to keep the six islands together. The Netherlands did this so as to make sure that the Netherlands Antilles could become independent as soon as possible, a call that became increasingly louder in the Netherlands after the Willemstad riots of 1969 in Curaçao. The government of the Netherlands Antilles feared that the whole Netherlands Antilles would disintegrate if one of the islands seceded; Antillean Prime Minister Juancho Evertsz once famously remarked that \\"six minus one equals zero\\". Increasing unrest on Aruba, especially after a consultative referendum on secession was organized by the island government in 1977, meant that the issue of Aruban secession had to be taken into consideration. After long negotiations, it was agreed that Aruba could become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986, but only on the condition that it would become fully independent in 1996. The People's Electoral Movement, which led the Aruban island government in the years to 1986, reluctantly agreed to this, but the Aruban People's Party, which came to power after 1986, refused all cooperation with the Netherlands on the issue of independence.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 175–209 On the other hand, the Netherlands became more and more aware that the ties with the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom would probably endure for a longer period of time. Suriname, the other partner of the Kingdom that attained independence in 1975, had gone through a period of dictatorship and civil war, which weakened the pro-independence ideology of the Dutch government. Aruba and the Netherlands agreed in July 1990 to delete Article 62, which foresaw Aruban independence in 1996, from the Charter. This was finalized in 1994, with some conditions about cooperation in the fields of justice, good governance and finance.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 213, 223–24 Wake of Aruban secession Meanwhile, the permanent position of Aruba as a separate country within the Kingdom led to calls for a similar arrangement for the other islands, especially on Sint Maarten. In the early 1990s, the five remaining islands entered into a period of reflection about whether or not to remain part of the Netherlands Antilles. In March 1990, Dutch Minister of Aruban and Antillean Affairs Ernst Hirsch Ballin came up with a draft for a new Kingdom Charter, in which the Leeward Antilles islands of Curaçao and Bonaire, and the Leeward Islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten would form two new countries within the Kingdom. This proposal met with mixed responses on the islands.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 213 After a committee was installed investigating the future of the Netherlands Antilles, a \\"Conference on the Future\\" (\\"Toekomstconferentie\\" in Dutch, litt. \\"Future-Conference\\") was held in 1993. The Netherlands proposed to take over the federal tasks of the Netherlands Antilles, with each of the islands remaining autonomous to the extent granted by the Islands Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles. Curaçao would be exempted and would attain country status like Aruba; Bonaire and Sint Maarten would be supported to help attain country status in the future; Saba and Sint Eustatius would not have this perspective and would remain what was called \\"Kingdom islands\\".Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 221 The fact that the Kingdom affairs would also be broadened to include law enforcement to reduce international crime (thus reducing the autonomy of Aruba and Curaçao), and that Sint Maarten would not attain country status right away, meant that the Conference could only result in a failure.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 221–24 It was decided to postpone the next meeting of the conference until after a status referendum was held on Curaçao. The referendum's result was in favour of maintaining and restructuring the Netherlands Antilles, in spite of the island government and the Netherlands Antillean government campaigning for country status. The other islands also voted for maintaining the Netherlands Antilles. The Party for the Restructured Antilles, composed of campaigners in favour of maintaining and restructuring the Netherlands Antilles, came to power.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 224 New referendum cycle in the wake of Sint Maarten's vote for autonomy In the end, restructuring the Netherlands Antilles did not get very far.Oostindie and Klinkers 2001: 272 Probably the most symbolic change was the adoption of an anthem of the Netherlands Antilles in 2000. In the same year another status vote was held on Sint Maarten, this time in favour of becoming a country of its own within the Kingdom. This sparked a new referendum cycle across the Netherlands Antilles. At the same time, a commission composed of representatives from the Netherlands and all the islands of the Netherlands Antilles investigated the future of the Netherlands Antilles. In its 2004 report, the commission advised a revision of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in order to dissolve the Netherlands Antilles, so that Curaçao and Sint Maarten would become countries of their own within the Kingdom, while Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba would become \\"Kingdom islands.\\" The referendum held on Curaçao in 2005 also came out in favour of country status. All other islands voted for closer ties with the Netherlands, except for Sint Eustatius, which wanted to retain the Netherlands Antilles. Round Table Conferences Following the referendums on all islands, the first Round Table Conference between the islands, the Netherlands Antillean government, and the Netherlands was organized on 26 November 2005. It was agreed that Curaçao and Sint Maarten should become countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while the three other islands should become directly part of the Netherlands. Agreement was reached that the Netherlands would take over the debts of the Netherlands Antilles, on condition that the islands would commit themselves to producing balanced budgets, so as to prevent future buildups of debt. A Board for Financial Supervision (Dutch: College financieel toezicht (Cft)), composed of members from both the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands, would be installed to supervise the budgets of the islands and of the Netherlands Antillean government. These agreements were worked out in the following year. At a Mini Round Table held on 11 October 2006, a closing agreement (Dutch: slotakkoord) was signed, which stated that Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius would become public bodies of the Netherlands. A closing agreement was reached with Curaçao and Sint Maarten on 2 November. This agreement included specifics on the workings of the Board for Financial Supervision. The closing agreements were ratified by the Netherlands and the individual islands, except by Curaçao, which rejected them on 29 November 2006. The other parties decided to continue negotiating without Curaçao. A transitional agreement was reached on 12 February 2007, which aimed at 15 December 2008, Koninkrijksdag, as the date of dissolution. The island council of Curaçao later in 2007 adopted the closing agreement, but in 2009 decided to put the agreement to a referendum. This referendum was narrowly in favour of the closing agreement. A similar referendum on Bonaire was annulled by the Governor of the Netherlands Antilles because the question posed was considered too vague. 15 December 2008 turned out to be an unfeasible date for dissolution. Instead a Round Table Conference was held on that day, in which the agreements were once again put on paper. In October 2009, it was agreed that the dissolution would take place on 10 October 2010, and on 9 September 2010 a closing Round Table was organized in which the Act of Parliament amending the Charter was ceremonially signed by the parties. Constitutional changes Curaçao and Sint Maarten Curaçao and Sint Maarten became two new \\"landen\\" (constituent states, literally: countries) within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along the lines of Aruba and the Netherlands. Their planned new joint currency is the Caribbean guilder, which was expected to be brought in by 2012 but was delayed. Aruba's right to secede from the Kingdom was not extended to the Curaçao and Sint Maarten. Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba The BES islands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba) have become direct parts of the Netherlands as special municipalities ('), a form of \\"public body\\" (openbaar lichaam) as outlined in article 134 of the Dutch Constitution.Originally the term used for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba to describe their expected association with the Netherlands was \\"Kingdom Islands\\" (Koninkrijkseilanden). The special municipalities do not constitute part of a province. These municipalities resemble ordinary Dutch municipalities in most ways (they have a mayor, aldermen and a municipal council, for example) and will have to introduce most Dutch law. Residents will be able to vote in Dutch national and European elections. There are, however, some derogations: social security, for example, is not on the same level as it is in the continental Netherlands. The three islands will have to involve the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs before they can make agreements with countries in the region. The special municipalities would be represented in the Kingdom Government by the Netherlands, as they can vote for the States-General (the Dutch parliament). On 1 January 2011, the three islands switched to the US dollar rather than the euro that is used in the European Netherlands. Joint Court All six islands may also continue to access the Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, the court of appeal superior to the islands' own courts of first instance. The islands share the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in The Hague with the entire Kingdom, including the European Netherlands. Status in the European Union The Kingdom of the Netherlands is a member of the European Union. However, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have the status of overseas countries and territories (OCTs) and are not part of the EU. Nevertheless, only one type of citizenship exists within the Kingdom (Dutch), and all Dutch citizens are EU citizens (including those in the OCTs). The Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands agreed not to change the status of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba with regard to the EU in the first five years of integration of these islands into the Netherlands, after which a re- evaluation of the islands' EU status is to take place. The islands thus will remain OCTs at least until 2015. Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Affairs – Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba behouden LGO-status The Netherlands secured a provision in the Treaty of Lisbon that says that any Caribbean part of the Netherlands can opt for a change of status to Outermost Region (OMR) if it so wishes, without having to change the Treaties of the European Union.The provision reads: Date of transition On 1 September 2009, Saba announced that it wished to withdraw from the Netherlands Antilles immediately, rather than wait until October 2010. However, according to Dutch State Secretary Bijleveld for Kingdom Relations, it was not legally possible for Saba to become separate from the Antilles earlier. The transition took place at midnight (00:00) on 10 October 2010 (\\"10/10/10\\") in the Netherlands Antilles (UTC-04:00), 06:00 in the European part of the Netherlands (UTC+02:00).Officielebekendmakingen.nl – Besluit van 23 September 2010 tot vaststelling van het tijdstip van inwerkingtreding van de artikelen I en II van de Rijkswet wijziging Statuut in verband met de opheffing van de Nederlandse Antillen Legal documents Kingdom charter The Kingdom Act amending the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands was drafted on 2009. It consists of six articles, with the changes to the Charter included in articles one to three. The Kingdom law provides for article 3 to take effect on the date of publication of the law in the official journal of the Netherlands, and articles 1 and 2 at a later date to be specified by royal decree. In this way the future countries of Sint Maarten and Curaçao will be able to draft their constitutions and fundamental legislation before the new relations within the Kingdom are to take effect.Voorstel Rijkswet wijziging Statuut in verband met de opheffing van de Nederlandse Antillen The House of Representatives adopted the bill on 2010, and the Senate on 2010.Eerstekamer.nl – Rijkswet wijziging Statuut in verband met de opheffing van de Nederlandse Antillen The Estates of the Netherlands Antilles adopted the bill on and the Estates of Aruba did the same on .RNW.nl – Antilliaanse Staten stemt in met wijziging StatuutRNW.nl – Aruba akkoord met Statuutwijziging Legislation for the integration of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba into the Netherlands On 21 November 2008, five draft acts for the integration of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba into the Netherlands were accepted by the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom. These acts are the Act on the public bodies of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (, abbreviated to WOLBES), the Act on financial relations of Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius, the Amendment to the election act with regard to Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius, the Introduction act on the public bodies of Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius, and the Adaptation act on the public bodies of Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius. WOLBES defines the administrative organization of the public bodies and is modeled on Dutch municipality law. The Introduction act specifies that Netherlands Antilles law will remain in force after the transition of the three islands to the Dutch polity, and defines the process in which Dutch law will slowly take over from Netherlands Antilles law in the islands. The Adaptation act adapts Netherlands Antilles law and Dutch law and is to take effect immediately.Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Affairs – Ministerraad stemt in met wetgeving Bonaire, Saba en Sint Eustatius voor overgang naar Nederlands staatbestel The House of Representatives adopted these acts on 2010, the Senate on .Eerstekamer.nl Stand van zaken aanhangige wetgeving Staatkundige vernieuwing van het Koninkrijk References  Bibliography  * Oostindie, Gert and Inge Klinkers (2001) Het Koninkrijk in de Caraïben: een korte geschiedenis van het Nederlandse dekolonisatiebeleid 1940–2000.

Thigh highs are held up by one or more bands sewn to the top that is backed with silicone on its inner surface. This ensures the thigh highs stay in position because of the elastic and the friction of the silicone against the skin. The silicone can become ineffective by contact with body lotions, oils and talcum powder, as they all reduce the friction of the silicone. Thigh highs are designed so that the elastic band exerts just the right pressure on a woman's thigh, avoiding any uncomfortable tightness or unflattering muffin-top effect. Sometimes thigh highs are preferred to pantyhose for hygiene reasons, because they reduce excessive microbial growth around the groin due to humidity and warmth. Thigh highs may be chosen because of the classic popular \\"stocking top\\" line, and there are no suspender bumps to be seen through a skirt or dress. Like stockings and pantyhose, the thickness of thigh-highs is measured in denier. History With the invention of nylon, thigh high stockings took center stage in women's fashion. While high-end consumers never lost their fascination with silk thigh highs, their nylon counterparts were so ubiquitous that they ended up baptizing the entire stocking family. In popular use, stockings were referred to as \\"nylons\\" in the 1940s. In the 1960s, thigh highs retreated towards a more marginal place in women's fashion. It is accepted that the popularity of the mini-skirt was an important factor in this. As the skirt was growing shorter and shorter, revealing the top line of the stockings became uncommon, and thigh highs became superseded by pantyhose. As a term, \\"hold-ups\\" was first used by \\"Pretty Polly\\" in 1967 for its self-supporting stockings. The term was not registered by the company, and has since become a generic trademark for the stocking style. Manufacturing process Modern stockings, pantyhose, and thigh highs are made by either flat knitting or the use of circular machines. Flat knitting is the original hosiery manufacturing technique of the 1930s–1950s. After the fabric has been produced, each thigh high is individually seamed. The top of the seam has a \\"finishing loop\\", a small hole that every seamed thigh high has as a result of the machinist turning the welt—the thigh high top—inside out, in order to finish off. Once sewn, the thigh highs are \\"boarded\\". This is a process where each thigh high is stretched over a flat metal leg form and \\"set\\" with steam. The knit tightens, creases are eliminated and the leg is correctly shaped. Because the process is time consuming, seamed thigh highs are never cheap. Also, around a third of production—especially during the production of sheer stockings—is discarded during quality control. Thigh highs are now most often produced on circular machines that eliminate back seams by knitting tubes that are then \\"set\\" to the shape of the leg. While the first circular machines produced sheer stockings with a reinforced heel pocket, modern machines have eliminated this, offering a better fit regardless of the wearer's shoe size. The addition of lycra to the stocking yarn was possibly the biggest break-through in hosiery manufacturing, the result being thigh highs that combine elasticity with the ability to cling to the leg.Fiore Direct USA: Pantyhose and Hosiery References Category:Hosiery ","title":"Hold-ups"},{"id":"10989457","text":"Senftenberg is a town in the district of Krems-Land in the Austrian state of Lower Austria.

He played collegiately at West Virginia. In his career Sheffey has also played for the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League and the New York Dragons of the Arena Football League and the Green Bay Blizzard of af2. Early life Sheffey moved to Catlettsburg, Kentucky after graduating from middle school in Baltimore. He then played high school football at Boyd County High School, where he was a two-time all-area selection and was named to the three-year all-district team. He was also a national champion in ballet and dance in high school. Collegiate career Sheffey enrolled at West Virginia University in January 2002, where he began his football career in 2003 as a freshman. He did not see very much playing time his freshman season, sitting behind guard Jeff Berk. He recorded a team- high four knockdowns against East Carolina though, and saw increased playing time at left guard in the second half of the game against Cincinnati. He also started against Miami (Fla.). In his sophomore season, 2004, Sheffey earned a starting role on the offensive line. He played in every game that season, blocking for quarterback Rasheed Marshall and running back Kay-Jay Harris. He moved into the starting lineup against UConn and recorded 20 knockdowns on the season. As a junior in 2005, Sheffey headed an offensive line along with future All-American Dan Mozes (who started the season at guard, but moved to center). He earned second-team All-Big East honors, while Mozes earned first- team honors. Although he suffered a chest contusion in the East Carolina win, he came back and recorded seven knockdowns in the win over Louisville in triple-overtime. He also recorded eight knockdowns against Cincinnati and UConn. In 2006, as a senior, Sheffey led one of the most successful senior classes in Mountaineer history along with Mozes (who was a senior as well). Blocking for All-American running back Steve Slaton and All-Big East quarterback Pat White, he made the list for the Outland Trophy (nation's best lineman) and earned All-Big East honors for the second consecutive year. Professional career Before the NFL Draft, Sheffey held a Pro Day at West Virginia on March 8, 2007. He ran a 5.11 40 yard dash, recorded 21 225 lb. bench reps, and recorded a 4.78 shuttle time. He was projected to be an undrafted free agent. Sheffey went unselected in the 2007 NFL Draft and became free agent. Shortly after the draft, the same day of the last rounds (April 29), he was the first of the Mountaineers who entered in the draft to be signed as a free agent. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, who didn't take an offensive lineman in the draft. He was released by the Chargers in August 2007.http://www.chargers.com/team/transactions/ On Wednesday February 13, 2008, Sheffey signed with the New York Dragons of the Arena Football League. Eight days later, he was placed on recallable waivers. After being waived by the Dragons, Sheffey signed with the Green Bay Blizzard of the af2 indoor football league (which is a \\"minor league\\" for the Arena Football League). In late May 2008, Sheffey was placed on injured reserve by the Blizzard after he injured his knee against the Quad City Steamwheelers. For the season, he played in five games, he carried the ball 12 times for 26 yards and two touchdowns. He also recorded 2.5 total tackles on defense.AF2 - 2008 Season Green Bay Blizzard After the season, he was released by the Blizzard.

Periodic continued fractions A regular periodic continued fraction consists of a finite initial block of partial denominators followed by a repeating block; if : \\\\zeta = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_k,\\\\overline{a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\\\\dots,a_{k+m}}],\\\\, then ζ is a quadratic irrational number, and its representation as a regular continued fraction is periodic. Clearly any regular periodic continued fraction consists of restricted partial quotients, since none of the partial denominators can be greater than the largest of a0 through ak+m. Historically, mathematicians studied periodic continued fractions before considering the more general concept of restricted partial quotients. Restricted CFs and the Cantor set The Cantor set is a set C of measure zero from which a complete interval of real numbers can be constructed by simple addition - that is, any real number from the interval can be expressed as the sum of exactly two elements of the set C. The usual proof of the existence of the Cantor set is based on the idea of punching a \\"hole\\" in the middle of an interval, then punching holes in the remaining sub-intervals, and repeating this process ad infinitum. The process of adding one more partial quotient to a finite continued fraction is in many ways analogous to this process of \\"punching a hole\\" in an interval of real numbers. The size of the \\"hole\\" is inversely proportional to the next partial denominator chosen - if the next partial denominator is 1, the gap between successive convergents is maximized. To make the following theorems precise we will consider CF(M), the set of restricted continued fractions whose values lie in the open interval (0, 1) and whose partial denominators are bounded by a positive integer M - that is, : \\\\mathrm{CF}(M) = \\\\\\\\{[0;a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\dots]: 1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq M \\\\\\\\}.\\\\, By making an argument parallel to the one used to construct the Cantor set two interesting results can be obtained. * If M ≥ 4, then any real number in an interval can be constructed as the sum of two elements from CF(M), where the interval is given by :: (2\\\\times[0;\\\\overline{M,1}], 2\\\\times[0;\\\\overline{1,M}]) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{M} \\\\left[\\\\sqrt{M^2 + 4M} - M \\\\right], \\\\sqrt{M^2 + 4M} - M \\\\right). *A simple argument shows that {\\\\scriptstyle[0;\\\\overline{1,M}]-[0;\\\\overline{M,1}]\\\\ge\\\\frac{1}{2}} holds when M ≥ 4, and this in turn implies that if M ≥ 4, every real number can be represented in the form n + CF1 + CF2, where n is an integer, and CF1 and CF2 are elements of CF(M). Zaremba's conjecture Zaremba has conjectured the existence of an absolute constant A, such that the rationals with partial quotients restricted by A contain at least one for every (positive integer) denominator. The choice A = 5 is compatible with the numerical evidence. Further conjectures reduce that value, in the case of all sufficiently large denominators. Jean Bourgain and Alex Kontorovich have shown that A can be chosen so that the conclusion holds for a set of denominators of density 1.

Fashion design and production became prominent in France since 15th century. During the 17th century, fashion exploded into a rich industry, for exportation and local consumption, the Royal Minister of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, says \\"Fashion is to France what the gold mines of Peru are to Spain...\\".https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/29/paris-life- luxury-getty-museum In the 19th century, fashion made a transition into specialisation for modern term haute couture, originated in the 1860s, bringing good taste to fashion argot. The term prêt-à-porter was born in the 1960s, reacting against the traditional notions of fashion and garment-making process, satisfying the needs of pop culture and mass media. Paris acts as the center of the fashion industry and holds the name of global fashion capital. The city is home to many prime designers, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Balmain, Louboutin, Pierre Cardin, Yves Saint Laurent, Roger Vivier, Thierry Mugler, Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier, Hermès, Lanvin, Chloé, Rochas, and Céline.Why is Paris the Capital of Fashion - LoveToKnow - Women's FashionFrench fashion facts- Paris Digest With the decentralization of the fashion industry, many cities including: Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lille and Strasbourg have their own luxury districts and avenues. In recent times, these have become important customers and significant producers. Île- de-France, Manosque, La Gacilly (near Rennes), and Vichy lead the cosmetic industry, and house well-known international beauty houses such as L'Oreal, Lancôme, Guerlain, Clarins, Yves Rocher, L'Occitane, Vichy, etc. The cities of Nice, Cannes and St. Tropez among others in the French riviera are well known as places of pleasure, annually hosting many media celebrities and personalities, potentates, and billionaires. The clothing of France is famous throughout the world. History  17th century, the Barroque and Classicisme Louis XIV, the \\"Sun king\\" was the absolute monarch of France, made his kingdom the leading European power and was the fashion idol of the Baroque age. =Fashion prints= The association of France with fashion and style (la mode) is widely credited as beginning during the reign of Louis XIV Kelly, 181. DeJean, chapters 2–4. when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. The rise in prominence of French fashion was linked to the creation of the fashion press in the early 1670s (due in large part to Jean Donneau de Visé), which transformed the fashion industry by marketing designs to a broad public outside the French courtDeJean, pp. 35–6, 46–7, 95. and by popularizing notions such as the fashion \\"season\\" and changing styles.DeJean, 48. The prints were usually 14.25 X 9.5 and depicted a man or woman of quality wearing the latest fashions. They were usually shown head to toe, but with no individuality or defined facial features. Sometimes the figure would be depicted from behind in order to showcase a different side of the clothing. Although the individual in the prints was often crudely sketched, the garment itself was impeccably drawn and detailed. Accessories to the garment also received nuanced attention.Norberg & Rosenbaum p. XV; Introduction. Louis XIV, although later hailed as a patron of fashion, did not actually have a large role in its spread and proliferation—which was due to the fashion prints. The fashion prints were ubiquitous, but Louis XIV neither sponsored nor hindered their production and proliferation, and largely stayed out of it unless the prints of himself specifically were treasonous, satirical, or caricatures. =Fashion in royal portraits= Over his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of the smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments. The depiction of the King in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud's frequently-reproduced Portrait of Louis XIV of 1701, in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs. In 1680, Louis began to be portrayed directly rather than in a mythological setting. This began the \\"fashion portraits\\", which were prints that depicted the King wearing the notable fashions of the season.In Norberg's article, she references the idea that Louis XIV's portrayal in fashion portraits mirrors the use of notable fashion models of today in order to sell clothing and trends. These prints were also largely unofficial, which meant printers were unaffiliated with the Crown. They largely went unchallenged by authorities, however, as long as they portrayed the King in a positive light. Those who did portray the King satirically or with the use of caricature faced imprisonment. Rigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture in Louis's reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis's personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the King's costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.See also However, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's original, now housed in the Louvre, was originally meant as a gift to Louis's grandson, Philip V of Spain. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis's exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty. =Trends= Louis XIV notably introduced one of the most noticeable feature of the men's costume of the time: immense wigs of curled hair. A commonly held belief is that Louis XIV started to wear wigs due to balding, and to imitate this his courtiers put on false hair. The wearing of wigs lasted for over a century; they went through many changes, but they were never quite so exaggerated as during this period. Despite the rise of la mode during Louis XIV's reign, many of the clothes he wore did not survive or were taken from the monarchy's possession. Much like the Crown Jewels, a French king did not actually own any of his clothes. They belonged to the Garde-robe du roi (King's Wardrobe), which dated back to the 16th century. Due to Louis XIV's changes to the King's Wardrobe, officers had a right to the clothes once the monarch died, as long as they would not be used by the king's successor.Norberg & Rosenbaum, and various authors. (Norberg, Louis XIV: King of Fashion?, p. 135-65) Furthermore, although the Louis XIV's formal clothing would change along with the rest of la mode, his ceremonial clothing did not, and remained with tradition. The king also used fashion to create a certain effect or theme. During the marriage of his great-grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy to Princess Marie Adélaïde, the French entourage dressed in bright colors and fashions to contrast with the more soberly dressed Spanish. This was in order to seem younger and more virile than the Spanish courtiers.  18th century, the Rococó and early New classicism  The extravagant styles of the French Royal court racked up enormous debts to keep up its pace, at the peasants' expense. Such fashion sprees notably ruined Marie Antoinette's reputation, and were one of the many factors paving the way for the French Revolution. left Long after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservative and the Catholic Church positions; and a major cultural icon associated with high glamour, wealth and a certain style of life based on luxury and celebrity appealing today to the social and cultural elites; frequently referenced in popular culture, being the subject of several books, films and other forms of media. Most academics and scholars, have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism government in addition to being frivolous, superficial; and have attributed the start of the French Revolution. The phrase \\"Let them eat cake\\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a \\"journalistic cliché\\".; ; It may have been a rumor started by angry French peasants as a form of libel. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Rousseau's putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions: \\"Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse à qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui répondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\\" (\\"Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche). Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a \\"great princess\\", some think that he invented it altogether as Confessions was largely inaccurate. The Sans-culottes (lit. \\"without knee-breeches\\") rejected the powdered wigs and the knee-breeches assimilated to the nobility, and instead favored informal styles (full-length trousers, and natural hair), which finally triumphed over the brocades, lace, periwig, and powder of the earlier eighteenth century.  19th century, full Neoclassicism and Empire style  Under Napoleon Bonaparte neo-classical styles reached its peak. After the fall of the Jacobins and their Sans-culottes supporters, the supporters of the Thermidorian Reaction were known as the Incroyables and Merveilleuses. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes. The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed \\"woven air\\", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the most popular. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as \\"Our Lady of Thermidor\\", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs. left The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by \\"dog ears\\", their hair falling on their ears. Their musk-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname muscadins among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-Jacobins. They wore bicorne hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their \\"executive power.\\" Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture. In addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included Anne Françoise Elizabeth Lange, Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier, and two very popular Créoles: Fortunée Hamelin and Hortense de Beauharnais. Hortense, a daughter of the Empress Josephine, married Louis Bonaparte and became the mother of Napoleon III. Fortunée was not born rich, but she became famous for her salons and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society compared Germaine de Staël and Mme Raguet to Minerva and Juno and named their garments for Roman deities: gowns were styled Flora or Diana, and tunics were styled à la Ceres or Minerva.Alfred Richard Allinson, The Days of the Directoire, J. Lane, (1910), p. 190 The leading Incroyable, Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, was one of five Directors who ran the Republic of France and gave the period its name. He hosted luxurious feasts attended by royalists, repentant Jacobins, ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However, de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a coup that brought the French Consulate to power and paved the way for Napoleon Bonaparte.  Final 19th and early 20th century, Belle époque and Années folles  Coco Chanel, French designer revolutionised fashion world, in the post-World War I era. France renewed its dominance of the high fashion () industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses, the fashion press (Vogue was founded in 1892 in USA, and 1920 in France) and fashion shows. The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman Charles Frederick Worth, who dominated the industry from 1858–1895.Kelly, 101. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of Jacques Doucet (founded in 1871), Rouff (founded 1884), Jeanne Paquin (founded in 1891), the Callot Soeurs (founded 1895 and operated by four sisters), Paul Poiret (founded in 1903), Louise Chéruit (founded 1906), Madeleine Vionnet (founded in 1912), House of Patou by Jean Patou (founded in 1919), Elsa Schiaparelli (founded in 1927) or Balenciaga (founded by the Spaniard Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1937). Chanel founded by Mademoiselle Coco Chanel, it first came to prominence in 1925, its philosophy was to emphasize understated elegance through her clothing. Her popularity thrived in the 1920s, because of innovative designs. Chanel's own look itself was as different and new as her creations. Instead of the usual pale-skinned, long-haired and full-bodied women preferred at the time, Chanel had a boyish figure, short cropped hair, and tanned skin. She had a distinct type of beauty that the world came to embrace. The horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and espadrille shoes—all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.  World War II, Trente Glorieuses and New Look  Many fashion houses closed during the occupation of Paris in World War II, including the Maison Vionnet and the Maison Chanel. In contrast to the stylish, liberated Parisienne, the Vichy regime promoted the model of the wife and mother, the robust, athletic young woman, a figure who was much more in line with the new political criteria. Germany, meanwhile, was taking possession of over half of what France produced, including high fashion, and was considering relocating French haute couture to the cities of Berlin and Vienna, neither of which had any significant tradition of fashion. The archives of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture were seized, mostly for their client lists as Jews were excluded from the fashion industry at this time. Evening dress, House of Dior, 1954. Indianapolis Museum of Art. During this era, the number of employed models was limited to seventy-five and designers often substituted materials in order to comply with wartime shortages. From 1940 onward, no more than thirteen feet (four meters) of cloth was permitted to be used for a coat and a little over three feet (one meter) for a blouse. No belt could be over one and a half inches (four centimeters) wide. As a result of the frugal wartime standards, the practical zazou suit became popular among young French men. In spite of the fact that so many fashion houses closed down or moved away during the war, several new houses remained open, including Jacques Fath, Maggy Rouff, Marcel Rochas, Jeanne Lafaurie, Nina Ricci, and Madeleine Vramant. During the Occupation, the only true way for a woman to flaunt her extravagance and add color to a drab outfit was to wear a hat. In this period, hats were often made of scraps of material that would have otherwise been thrown away, sometimes incorporating butter muslin, bits of paper, and wood shavings. Among the most innovative milliners of the time were Pauline Adam, Simone Naudet, Rose Valois, and Le Monnier. Post-war fashion returned to prominence through Christian Dior's famous \\"New Look\\" in 1947: the collection contained dresses with tiny waists, majestic busts, and full skirts swelling out beneath small bodices, in a manner very similar to the style of the Belle Époque. The extravagant use of fabric and the feminine elegance of the designs appealed greatly to a post-war clientele. Other important houses of the period included Pierre Balmain and Hubert de Givenchy (opened in 1952). The fashion magazine Elle was founded in 1945. In 1952, Coco Chanel herself returned to Paris.Caroline Weber, \\"Fashion\\", in Dauncey (2003), pp. 193–95.

Karl Lagerfeld was one of the most prestigious and powerful designers in the modern fashion world, former creative head of Chanel fashion house. In the 1960s, \\"high fashion\\" came under criticism from France's youth culture (including the yé-yés) who were turning increasingly to London and to casual styles.Weber, p. 196. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established high fashion norms by launching a prêt-à-porter (\\"ready to wear\\") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing and marketing (member houses of the Chambre Syndicale were forbidden to use even sewing machines).Weber, p. 195. In 1985, Caroline Rennolds Milbank wrote, \\"The most consistently celebrated and influential designer of the past twenty-five years, Yves Saint Laurent can be credited with both spurring the couture's rise from its sixties ashes and with finally rendering ready-to-wear reputable.\\" He is also credited with having introduced the tuxedo suit for women and was known for his use of non-European cultural references, and non-white models.Yves Saint Laurent's body put to rest Fashion Television. Further innovations were carried out by Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. In post-1968 France, youth culture would continue to gravitate away from the \\"sociopolitically suspect\\" luxury clothing industry, preferring instead a more \\"hippy\\" look (termed baba cool in French).Weber, p. 198. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and '80s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH. Fashion is so important to the French that, as The New York Times in 1995 quoted in an article on users of online dating services on Minitel, \\"Where else but in France would people describe themselves to potential partners in terms of their clothes?\\" Since the 1960s, France's fashion industry has come under increasing competition from London, New York, Milan and Tokyo. Nevertheless, many foreign designers still seek to make their careers in France: Karl Lagerfeld (German) at Chanel, John Galliano (British) and later, Raf Simons (Belgian) at Dior, Paulo Melim Andersson (Swedish) at Chloe, Stefano Pilati (Italian) at Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs (American) at Louis Vuitton, and Kenzo Takada (Japanese) and Alexander McQueen (English) at Givenchy (until 2001).

The film tells the story of the Hekes, an urban Māori family, and their problems with poverty, alcoholism, and domestic violence, mostly brought on by the patriarch Jake. The film was directed by Lee Tamahori, written by Riwia Brown and stars Rena Owen, Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis, and has won numerous awards. Plot Beth leaves her small town and much to her parents' chagrin, she marries Jake \\"The Muss\\" (named for his big muscles) Heke. After 18 years, they live in an unkempt state house in South Auckland, New Zealand, and have five children. Their interpretations of life and being Māori are tested. Jake is fired from his job, but remains satisfied with receiving unemployment benefit and spending most days getting drunk at a nearby pub with his friends. He has a violent streak that he displays by savagely beating a muscular patron who dares disrupt a female singer's (Mere Boynton) performance. He often invites crowds of friends from the bar to his home for drunken parties. When his wife \\"gets lippy,\\" he brutally beats her in front of their friends, who are too intimidated to interfere. Beth turns to booze when things go wrong, and has angry outbursts and occasional violence of her own on a much smaller scale. Her children fend for themselves, resignedly cleaning the blood-streaked house after their father beats their mother. Nig, the Hekes' eldest son, moves out to join a gang whose rituals include getting facial tattoos (in Māori culture called tā moko). He undergoes an initiation beating by gang members, passes and is then embraced as a new brother. Nig later sports the gang's tattoos. He cares about his siblings but despises his father. He is angered when his mother is beaten but does not intervene. Jake's middle son, Mark aka \\"Boogie,\\" has a history of petty criminal offences. He is placed in a foster home as a ward of the state due to his parents' home life. Jake is unconcerned with Boogie's incarceration and hopes it will toughen him up. Despite his initial anger, Boogie finds a new niche for himself after the foster home's manager, Mr. Bennett, helps him embrace his Māori heritage. Grace, the Hekes' 13-year- old daughter, keeps a journal in which she chronicles events, as well as stories she tells her younger siblings. Her best friend is a homeless boy named Toot, who lives in a wrecked car. She dreads a future she believes is inevitable and is constantly reminded of getting married and playing the role of a wife, which she believes comprises catering to a husband's demands and enduring beatings. She dreams of leaving and living an independent and single life. Grace is raped in her bed by Uncle Bully, a friend of her father's who tells her it is her fault for \\"turning him on\\" by wearing her \\"skimpy little nighty.\\" She falls into a deep depression and seeks support from Toot, with whom she smokes marijuana for the first time. Toot kisses her but she reacts violently and storms out, believing he is \\"just like the rest of them.\\" Confused, Grace eventually goes home to an angry Jake with his friends. Bully asks for a goodnight kiss to test his power over her. She refuses and Jake sees it as a sign of disrespect and rips her journal in two and nearly beats her up. Beth returns home from searching for Grace, and then screams hysterically after finding her daughter has hanged herself from a tree branch in the backyard. Jake deals with the tragedy in his usual selfish way, going to the pub with his mates while the rest of his family takes Grace's body to a tangihanga. Beth stands up to him for the first time when he refuses to let her be taken to the marae. The film cross-cuts between the mourning, Jake drinking with his friends at the pub and the family on the marae. Boogie impresses Beth with his Māori singing at the funeral, and Toot says his goodbyes, telling Grace the gentle kiss was all his gesture meant. Boogie reassures Toot that Grace loved him, and Beth invites him to live with them. Reading Grace's diary later that day, Beth finds out about the rape and confronts Bully at the pub. Jake initially threatens Beth for accusing his friend, but Nig steps between them, protecting his mother. Nig hands his father Grace's diary, and after glancing at it, Jake explodes in a rage, nearly beating Bully to death and castrating him with a broken bottle. Beth blames Jake just as much as Bully because of his violent lifestyle, and decides to leave him. Beth tells Jake of her intention to take their children back to her Māori village and traditions, defiantly telling him that her Māori heritage gives her the strength to resist his control over her. Jake cusses and yells at her on a curb outside the pub as the family leaves, with police sirens wailing in the background. Cast * Rena Owen as Beth Heke, the matriarch of the Heke family. She cares for her family's welfare and shows them the love that Jake will not, even though she is not present at Boogie's court hearing. Much like Jake, she too is an alcoholic although she is less abusive. * Temuera Morrison as Jake \\"the Muss\\" Heke. The abusive, alcoholic husband of Beth Heke. In addition to abusing his wife and his family, he is a selfish, lazy, and arrogant man who will tear anyone down if he feels they stand in his way. He tends to spend a lot of time at the pub getting drunk with his mates and often hosts \\"drunken parties.\\" * Julian Arahanga as Nig Heke. The oldest son of Jake and Beth Heke. He despises his father, and he eventually joins a gang to make up for the missing father figure in his life, though this gang is revealed to be just as violent as Jake himself. * Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell as Grace Heke, the cynical daughter of Beth and Jake. She enjoys writing stories to make up for all of the craziness in her life and eventually hangs herself as a result of being raped by Bully and the constant violence around her. * Taungaroa Emile as Mark \\"Boogie\\" Heke, the middle son of Beth and Jake, he is something of a juvenile delinquent as he is sent to a borstal since none of his parents were able to show up to his court hearing on his behalf, though Grace was present. At the borstal, he soon finds himself a new niche as he grows very fond of his Māori heritage. * Rachael Morris Jr. as Polly Heke * Joseph Kairau as Huata Heke * George Henare as Mr. Bennett, the man at the borstal who takes Boogie under his wing after he is seen smashing windows in the gymnasium with a Taiaha. * Cliff Curtis as Uncle Bully, Jake's friend who is revealed to be a pedophile after he rapes Grace in her bed at one of Jake's \\"drunken parties.\\" * Pete Smith as Dooley, Jake and Bully's happy-go-lucky friend. * Calvin Tuteao as Taka * Shannon Williams as Toot, Grace's best friend who is revealed to have a crush on her. He tries to kiss Grace, but she angrily storms off as she is reminded of Bully raping her the night before. He lives in a car under a motorway overpass, and is known to be a drug addict as well. Yet he remains very optimistic about the future. * Mere Boynton as Mavis Production Once Were Warriors is the first feature film produced by Communicado Productions. The production won Best Film at the Durban International Film Festival, Montreal Film Festival, New Zealand Film & Television Awards, and Rotterdam Film Festival. It also became at the time the highest-grossing film in New Zealand, surpassing The Piano (1993). Once Were Warriors was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. The film was shot at a local state house, located at 33 O'Connor Street, Otara, in the Auckland metropolitan area. The neighbours of the house used for filming complained on numerous occasions due to the film's late night party scenes. Reception Once Were Warriors was critically lauded on release, and the film currently has a rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews with an average rating of 7.8 out of 10. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and observed: \\"Once Were Warriors has been praised as an attack on domestic violence and abuse. So it is. But I am not sure anyone needs to see this film to discover that such brutality is bad. We know that. I value it for two other reasons: its perception in showing the way alcohol triggers sudden personality shifts, and its power in presenting two great performances by Morrison and Owen. You don't often see acting like this in the movies. They bring the Academy Awards into perspective.\\" In The Movie Show review of 1994, Margaret Pomeranz called Once Were Warriors \\"a very impressive big screen debut from director Lee Tamahori,\\" while also praising the cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh and the performances of the films leads, Morrison and Owen. Co-host David Stratton described the film as \\"astonishing,\\" \\"absolutely devastating,\\" and \\"a really, really, really good film.\\" Stratton also compared Once Were Warriors favourably with New Zealand's Heavenly Creatures of the same year. Pomeranz gave Once Were Warriors four stars out of five while Stratton gave it four point five. A 2014 New Zealand survey voted Once Were Warriors the best New Zealand film of all time.

It is maintained and preserved by the Michigan Nature Association. One of the larger white pine trees in the Sanctuary. The area was originally part of a 2,400-acre tract of land owned by Edward Estivant of Paris, who sold it to Calumet and Hecla Mining Company in 1947. Universal Oil acquired the area in 1968, and soon logged 300 acres of nearby forest. A fund-raising campaign by the Michigan Nature Association lead in 1973 to the purchase of 200 acres from Universal Oil. Three subsequent acquisitions, between 1989 and 2005, have expanded the sanctuary to 510 acres. The area protects one of the last old-growth white pine (Pinus strobus) stands in Michigan. Two connected loop trails are in the sanctuary, the one-mile Cathedral Grove loop and the 1.2 mile Bertha Daubendiek trail . The Sanctuary includes some white pines growing more than 125 feet tall and dating back over 300 years, having established after a fire in about 1695 . The forest predominantly consists of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), with the white pines appearing as emergent stems above the maple/fir canopy. There are a few understory white pine saplings, but these face competition with many other tree species before they can enter the canopy; it remains to be seen whether gap dynamics will allow this to occur . More than 85 bird species have been inventoried in the sanctuary, including woodpeckers, hawks, and red crossbills. Despite thin soil and boreal climate, several wildflowers grow, such as asters, Clintonia, baneberry, and violets. A wide variety of ferns, like maidenhair, spleenwort, and holly fern, blanket the forest floor .

Until 1919, the Receiver-General had a seat in the Legislative Council but he was removed as an ex officio member of the Council under the Isle of Man Constitution Amendment Act 1919. The holder of this office was called \\"Receiver-General and Collector\\" between 1765 and 1832, and since then Receiver-General only. After 1765, he had no land revenues to collect. He shared the work of collecting the customs duties and port dues with the Water-Bailiff until 1832, when he was superseded by the appointment of a Collector, who was taken from among the members of HM Customs service. It would seem that, between 1832 and 1835, this official performed no duties whatever, but in the latter year he was constituted Chairman of the Harbour Board, a body which was at that time appointed by the British Government. In 1791, the Receiver-General was deprived of his seat in the Legislative Council on the grounds that he was not appointed by patent under any of the royal seals, but he was then, on the representation of the commissioners, restored to it. He did not, however, take advantage of this privilege till 1813. Between 1832 and 1872, he did not sit in the Legislative Council, though there seems to have been nothing to prevent his doing so. In 1872, when the appointment of the Harbour Board was vested in the Governor, subject to the approval of Tynwald, he resumed his seat.

In the Western World, it is typically distinct from—but nevertheless often overlaps with—other national elites, such as the United Kingdom's aristocracy and the United States' upper class. United Kingdom Francis Williams, an Afro- Caribbean British scholar and poet. A member of a property-owning Afro- Jamaican family, he took British citizenship in 1723. The Nigerian British actor David Oyelowo has had a successful career in both Britain and the United States, where he has also taken U.S. citizenship. He was born into a royal family of the Nigerian chieftaincy system. The model Adwoa Aboah is a Ghanaian British descendant of the Lowthers of Lowther Castle, Earls of Lonsdale. Her earliest Lowther ancestor served as Lord Warden of the March of Western England in the 16th century. In the United Kingdom, the black community has largely consisted of immigrants and their descendants whose residency in the country dates from either the time of the old Empire or that of the new Commonwealth. Persons classified as being of African descent have nevertheless been a recognizable component of British society since at least the Elizabethan period. An elite developed within the community over the course of several centuries. Its ranks were swelled over time by the mixed-race children of colonial British aristocrats (such as Dido Elizabeth Belle), members of the older black elites of British Africa (such as Sara Forbes Bonetta), the rise of black and mixed-race national leaders (such as Paul Boateng), and the success of numerous black and mixed-race persons in specialized industries, such as the arts (for example, Lenny Henry). Like their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere, members of the black elite historically took part in the campaign to abolish slavery in the empire. Some, like former enslaved African Olaudah Equiano, even became politically prominent by way of their efforts. Following the abolition in the early 1800s, black people continued to gain prominence in Britain's social, political and cultural life. Mary Seacole was a heroine of the Crimean War, and Learie Constantine was an important cricketer. Today, Britain's black and mixed-race people are included in the annual Powerlist - a ranking of the nation's most prominent people of colour. A number of them, such as Boateng and Henry, are also peers and/or knights of the realm. There is also a small community of British aristocrats that are of partially black descent. A notable member of this latter sub-group is the mixed-race royal Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the heir apparent to the noble titles that are held by his father Prince Harry of Wales. United States chief of the Crow Nation, James Beckwourth was the son of an American planter and his enslaved African-American mistress. He is now regarded as the most important Black mountain man in the history of the Old West. A writer and social activist, Langston Hughes was one of the leading lights of the Harlem Renaissance. His family, the Langstons, were prominent free blacks. The tennis champion Arthur Ashe, also an AIDS activist. He became a member of the African-American upper class. His direct line of descent in the United States could be traced to 1735. In the North of the United States, many educated black people (taking advantage of their relative freedom) took part in abolitionist and suffragist activities. They also provided support to stations of the Underground Railroad prior to the abolition of slavery. In the South, an elite started forming before the American Civil War among free black people who managed to acquire property. Of the free people of color in North Carolina in the censuses from 1790 to 1810, 80% can be traced to African Americans free in Virginia during the colonial period. Most were descended from unions between free white women and enslaved or free Africans or African Americans. Free black people migrated into frontier Virginia and then to other states over several generations in the colonial period, as did many of their neighbors. Extensive research into colonial court records, wills and deeds has demonstrated that most of those free families came from relationships or marriages between white women, servant or free, and black men, servant, free or slave. Such relationships were part of the more fluid relationships among the working class before the boundaries of slavery hardened.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland and Delaware During slavery times, white slaveholders and others were known to sexually abuse enslaved African women, fathering mixed-race children. There were also slaveholders who had caring relationships, common-law marriages, and legal marriages to enslaved black women. They sometimes freed such women and their children. Some slaveholders did provide for their mixed-race children by ensuring they were educated; in the earliest periods, they might be apprenticed to a trade or craft. In some cases, fathers arranged to settle property on their \\"natural\\" children. Whatever property the father passed on to the child was important in helping that person get a start in life. These mulattos in turn patterned their subsequent lives after \\"polite\\" white society. In some places, such as New Orleans, this system coalesced into what was known as Plaçage. In the South, the free black elite often took leadership roles within the church, black schools, and community. Natural leaders rose up from many different classes. Some developed catering businesses or other services that enabled them to take advantage of their white contacts through family and other connections. The black elite also enjoyed the benefits of living within the white neighborhoods, which further isolated them from the darker-skinned African Americans and which caused many of them to blame them for the downward shifts in life-style choices. Some lighter skinned black people even passed for white, and were assimilated into white society thereafter. The Civil Rights Movement and affirmative action brought about many changes for the black elite. As the old elite died away, a new black elite emerged. Within its ranks are politicians, entrepreneurs, actors, singers, sports figures, and many more who are otherwise part of America's wider upper-middle class. Other examples The trader and community leader Mohammed Shitta Bey. A chief in the Nigerian chieftaincy system, he was created a bey in the nobility of Ottoman Turkey in the year before his death. Angélica, consort to Julio Pinedo, King of the Afro-Bolivians. The Afro- Bolivian monarch claims direct descent from medieval royals of the West and Central African regions. The philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah - a chief in the Ghanaian chieftaincy system - is also connected to the upper classes of the Western world: His direct line of descent can be traced back to the Norman monarchs of medieval England.

Biography  Javad Khan was a son of Shahverdi Khan and brother of Rahim Khan. Javad Khan succeeded his brother on Rahim Khan's deposition through Georgian intervention in 1786. Alike the then ruling dynasty of Iran, Javad Khan was a member of the Qajar tribe. With the accession to power, Javad Khan faced a threat from Georgia. In September 1787, a combined Georgia and Russian army under the command of Colonel Burnashev marched to Ganja, but the ongoing Russo-Turkish war forced the allies to withdraw. A fragile peace ensued and the Georgia king Erekle II granted Javad Khan control over Shamshadilu, but the khan of Ganja failed to bring the district into submission. In early 1789 Erekle II, now allied with Fath Ali Khan of Quba and Muhammad Hasan Khan of Shaki, attacked Ganja and Javad Khan had to abandon his capital without fighting. After three months, Fath Ali Khan died and Javad was able to resume his reign. His political orientation was pro-Iranian that brought him in conflict with Georgia and Russia. In 1795, Javad Khan of Ganja joined the Iranian expedition against Georgia. Erekle II retaliated by blockading Ganja in 1796, but the khan of Karabakh brokered peace. In September 1796 Ganja was temporarily occupied by the Russian general Valerian Zubov during his Persian Expedition of 1796. During the first Russo- Persian War (1804-1813), Ganja was considered by Russians as a town of foremost importance. General Pavel Tsitsianov approached Javad khan several times asking him to submit to Russian rule, but each time was refused. In November 1803, the Russian army moved from Tiflis and in December, Tsitsianov started the siege preparations. After heavy artillery bombardment, on January 3, 1804, Tsitsianov gave the order to attack the fortress. During the fierce fighting, Armenians residing in the city open the gates of the castle and, as a result, the Russians were able to capture the fortress. Javad khan was killed, together with his sons at war. Some members of his family were able to escape to Tabriz, while others remained in Ganja. Javad Khan's descendants in the Russian empire bore the surname Ziatkhanov. Ismail Khan Ziatkhanov was a member of the First State Duma of the Russian empire, and later a prominent activist of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

The album was released on CD in two editions, which are significantly different. The first edition, with the \\"glam\\" cover (illustrated in this article) had the original song order reshuffled, with poorly done fade-outs and fade-ins. This edition also came with a second section, a reunion show with (at least) Stiv Bators and Cheetah Chrome present, from 1987. This edition also had extensive liner notes detailing Bators' trick of singing off-mike, and claims he re-recorded the entire album in one take, from memory, while drunk and in the booth with two groupies - in other words, typical Stiv. The second CD issue of Night of the Living Dead Boys had the original album artwork - from the front anyway, though not the photo collage on the back - along with the original, unedited, uninterrupted song order.

The vest uses eight trademarked \\"contact points\\" that simulate gunfire, body slams or G-forces associated with race car driving. It is unique because unlike traditional force feedback accessories, the vest is directional, so that action taking place outside the players' field of view can also be felt. A player hit by gunfire from behind will actually feel the shot in his back while he may not be otherwise aware of this using standard visual display cues. Gaming reporter Charlie Demerjian of The Inquirer said, \\"If they can keep the price reasonable and have a few good games, this has a chance of becoming a useful gaming accessory.\\" Currently, players have three ways to utilize the vest. Playing games with Direct Integration, such as TN Games' own 3rd Space Incursion, using the 3rd space game drivers whilst playing a game (drivers currently in Beta 2), or installing specially made mods for a game.

The palace was most likely originally built in the mid-19th century and sold to Khedive Ismail in 1866 by his brother Mustafa Fazl Pasha. It is situated several kilometers north of downtown Cairo, Koubbeh Palace was originally surrounded by agricultural fields and rural villages.  Under the Monarchy  Under Khedive Tewfik, Koubbeh Palace was a venue for One Thousand And One Night celebrations, royal weddings, and a place where visiting dignitaries admired magnificent gardens. During his son's rule (Khedive Abbas Hilmi II; r. 1892-1914) the garden palace gradually came to be regarded as complementary to Cairo's Abdin Palace in terms of officialdom. When King Fouad I ascended Egypt's throne in 1917, Koubbeh became the official royal residence. During his reign, King Fouad ordered numerous enhancements and extensions to Koubbeh, including a six-meter wall around the , a new gate and an external garden. In addition, a royal train station was added to the palace complex where visiting dignitaries arrived by special carriage directly from Alexandria or from Cairo's main railway station. It was at this palace that King Fouad died, and his then 16-year-old son King Farouk greeted his subjects during a momentous inaugural radio broadcast on 8 May 1936. King Farouk kept his personal collections at Koubbeh. These priceless treasures included a precious stamp collection, an 8,500-piece coin and medals collection, studded clocks and watches, in addition to many other beautiful antiquities including a pure gold coffee set and a 1906 Faberge egg that belonged to the last Russian Tzar. Much of these were auctioned off in 1954.  The Republic  After the 1952 revolution that led to the declaration of the republic, Koubbeh Palace was declared as one of three official presidential palaces, the other two being Abdeen Palace in downtown Cairo and Ras Al-Teen Palace in Alexandria. Nevertheless, it was at Koubbeh that Gamal Abdel Nasser preferred to host his official guests. It was also there that his body lay awaiting his funeral in September 1970. The Shah of Iran also lived in this palace when in exile in Egypt. To this day Koubbeh remains Egypt's principal guesthouse.

The central character, an unnamed female, feels displaced and without a strong sense of identity and individuality. Throughout the story, she raises the courage to undertake a journey to uncover details about her heritage. Plot summary Loving Che centers on the lives of an unnamed female protagonist who is searching for her mother, and Teresa de la Landre, who claims to be her mother. Broken into three distinct parts, the novel begins with the female protagonist, moves into a commentary by Teresa de la Landre, and closes with the female protagonist. Not long after Fidel Castro's successful Cuban Revolution in 1959, the protagonist's grandfather takes his infant granddaughter to America, at the request of his daughter (the protagonist's mother). Growing up in Miami, the protagonist knows little about her parentage or about Cuba. After years of silence and numerous unanswered questions, the protagonist confronts her grandfather about her heritage, particularly pressing him for details about her mother. Talking about his daughter (the protagonist's mother) for the first time, he reveals she wanted her daughter out of Cuba and promised she would reunite with them six months later. Although the grandfather claims he did not want to separate his daughter from her only child, he obliged. The grandfather recalls that it was only after he had safely arrived in Miami with his granddaughter that he found his daughter's farewell note pinned to his granddaughter's sweater. Unable to return to his homeland because of the political unrest between America and Cuba, the grandfather revealed he tried to contact his daughter, but all his attempts failed. Although the protagonist now has some idea about her heritage, she still feels somewhat lost, drops out of the university, and starts traveling the world. While traveling the world, the protagonist learns of her grandfather's death and returns to America. Realizing the passing of time is reducing her chances of locating her mother, the protagonist travels to Cuba with her mother's farewell note. Unable to locate her mother, the protagonist returns to Miami, starts a career as a travel writer and tries to forget her past. When a mysterious package arrives from Spain, the protagonist's interest in her heritage resurges. The package, filled with photographs and letters, is from a woman named Teresa de la Landre, who claims to be her mother. The contents of the package are the subject of the second section of Loving Che in which the protagonist sifts through the contents seeking to uncover details of her heritage. Somewhat skeptical of the letters at first, the protagonist reads about Teresa's life, her career as a painter, and her marriage to Calixto de la Landre. Within her letters, Teresa also states she had an affair with the revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara and claims the protagonist is the result of their affair. The possible connection between the protagonist and Guevara is important to the novel because of his mythical status throughout the world, especially Cuban culture. Guevara played a significant part in helping Castro seize control of Cuba, and his desire to help the poor and oppressed throughout the world work together to overthrow imperialist governments in order to live free of capitalistic ideals, further built his legendary status. Realizing that being an illegitimate daughter of such an idealized person could have wide-ranging implications for the protagonist prompts her to uncover more details about her past. In the third section of the book the protagonist seeks authentication of Teresa's story, particularly Teresa's claim that she had an affair with Guevara and the likelihood that she is the product of their affair. The protagonist contacts Dr. Caraballo, a professor of history, and Jacinto Alcazar, a photographer who knew Fidel Castro and Che Guevara briefly. With neither believing the likelihood of Guevara and Teresa's affair, the protagonist travels to Cuba. This time, the protagonist seeks to verify Teresa's story along with trying to locate her mother. During this later trip to Cuba, the protagonist gains a better understanding of herself by connecting with her country of birth. Although she does not find her mother – a Cuban local claims that her mother is dead – nor does she find out if Teresa and Guevara were her parents, the protagonist no longer appears to feel displaced from her heritage. Previously, when she had visited Cuba the protagonist felt detached, like a tourist. On this latest trip, however, she sees the city with fresh, more favorable eyes and refers to herself as Cuban. Having this connection with all things Cuban, the protagonist also sees Guevara in a new light. Having little knowledge of Guevara prior to receiving Teresa's letters, the protagonist reads many books about him and now feels like he is less foreign to her. Seeing a picture of Guevara in a Manhattan store, the protagonist reflects on what might have been: “a beautiful stranger, who in a different dream, might have been the father of my heart” (226). Significant Characters Because of the uncertainty of the names of people and places, the novel is ambiguous in parts. Menéndez purposely recreates this ambiguity in order to highlight the circumstances many exiled Cuban-Americans face as they try to uncover details of their past. *Unnamed female protagonist: Exiled Cuban-American who came to America as a baby following the Cuban Revolution in 1959. She lives in Miami, is a free-lance travel writer, and seeks knowledge of her heritage. *Teresa de la Landre: Possibly the female protagonist's mother, a painter, married to Calixto. She claims to have had an affair with Ernesto “Che” Guevara and the unnamed protagonist is the result. Other Important Characters *Unnamed Cuban grandfather: Exiled Cuban-American, grandfather of unnamed female protagonist. He brings his granddaughter safely to Miami, Florida following the Cuban Revolution in 1959. *Dr. Caraballo: Professor of Cuban history at the University of Miami. She analyzes Teresa's letters and deems them fake. *Jacinto Alcazar: Onetime photographer of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. He believes a relationship between Guevara and Teresa is unlikely. Themes Three major themes in the novel are: # Search for identity: Like many Cuban- Americans living in exile, the unnamed female protagonist seeks knowledge of her past in order to formulate her own identity. Displaced by Castro's insurgence in 1959 and the resulting changes to Cuba's political and social landscape, many Cubans like the protagonist, fled the country. Also, like many Cuban-Americans, the protagonist's family was torn apart, and this left her feeling displaced from her family and her culture. Furthermore, without a strong sense of connection with her heritage, the protagonist has found it hard to adjust to the American way of life. Of particular concern for the protagonist is the reliability of memory and how it inhibits her desire to locate her mother and/or verify Teresa's claim that she and Guevara are her parents. # The role of memory: The trouble the protagonist has locating information about her mother and/or verifying Teresa's letters reveals the complexity of memory. When the protagonist confronts her grandfather about her mother, he tries to remember the incidents surrounding their exile from Cuba over twenty years earlier. However, because of his age and the length of time that has passed, he produces disjointed recollections. While he does produce an unsigned note that he claims the protagonist's mother wrote to her over twenty years earlier, the lack of other supplementary evidence from the past does little to fill the ‘gaps’ in his disjointed story. When the package containing letters and photographs from Teresa de la Landre arrives from Spain, the role of memory is evident once again. Written over twenty years after the protagonist was born, Teresa's memories of the events surrounding the time (she claims) the protagonist was born are at times sporadic. Possibly to make up for some of the ‘gaps’ in her memory, or perhaps as a persuasive device, Teresa includes countless photos of Che Guevara (the man she claims is the protagonist's father). Although the photos of Guevara help fill many of the memory ‘gaps’ in Teresa's story, without substantiating many dates, times, and locations, the protagonist is unable to ‘officially’ verify Teresa's story. #Mothering: Two types of mothering relationships are evident in Loving Che: the mother-daughter relationship and Cuba as motherland. Although Teresa does not have a typical mother-daughter relationship with her daughter, Teresa's letters reveal the type of relationship she wishes she could have had. By communicating with her daughter for the first time in over twenty years, Teresa is clearly trying to connect with her daughter. Likewise, the protagonist's renewed search to verify Teresa's letters and possibly locate her mother highlights her desire to connect with her mother. Although the protagonist never officially announces Teresa is her mother, she does let her feelings towards her slip near the end of the novel before quickly returning to call Teresa by her name. Near the end of the novel, the protagonist says, “I hoped to forget the strange packet of memories my mother bequeathed to me” (220). Because the only ‘official’ thing the protagonist received from her mother (via her grandfather) was the note pinned to her sweater twenty years earlier, it is clear that the protagonist is referring to the package Teresa sent. Cuba as motherland is another mothering relationship that occurs within the novel. Like many exiled Cuban-Americans, the protagonist's loss of homeland or motherland has been significant. While she does not locate her mother or ‘officially’ verify Teresa's story, the many trips the protagonist makes to Cuba helps her establish a connection with her country of birth. Only seeing the country as a “sad state” in the past, the protagonist now sees it with new, “amazed” eyes (181). This reassessment of the country highlights the protagonist's willingness to accept her country of birth. When someone in Cuba asks the protagonist if she is British, she immediately connects with her country by announcing she is “Cuban” (185). Connecting with her motherland, and in part, connecting with Teresa, the protagonist no longer sees Guevara as such a strange, distant man. Instead, when she sees a photo of Guevara in a Manhattan store, the protagonist can understand why Cubans, including Teresa, would love such a man. Reflecting her new view of Guevara she states, “a beautiful stranger, who in a different dream, might have been the father of my heart” (226). Works cited Menéndez, Ana. Loving Che.

Their shows were noted for their crazy blackout gags and orchestrated mayhem (\\"anything can happen, and it probably will\\"). Their most famous concept, Hellzapoppin, has become show-business shorthand for freewheeling, anything-goes comedy; it enjoyed a lengthy run on Broadway and spawned a movie version. Overview Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson began as musical entertainers: Olsen played the violin and Johnson played ragtime piano. They met in 1914 when Olsen hired Johnson to replace the pianist in his College Four quartet. Ole and Chic hit it off immediately and joined forces for a vaudeville act. No joke was too old, no song too corny for Ole and Chic, and the two engaging comics became a minor sensation in the Midwest. Radio enlarged their audience and led to appearances in early talkie movies for Warner Bros. and two more minor features for Republic Pictures. The movies of the 1930s, though, were much too confining for Olsen and Johnson's special brand of nut humor. Ole and Chic recited their lines and played off each other well, but their scripts were too formal, leaving the team little room for their nonsensical comedy. During the summer of 1932, they were featured each week on NBC's (radio) Red Network's Fleischmann's Yeast Hour. Based on surviving samples, Rudy Vallee did not interact with them on-air. The intense and fast-paced segments were titled \\"The Padded Cell of the Air\\". As 1932 was a presidential election year, they nominated Mickey Mouse for President. The \\"Padded Cell...\\" segments are clearly a predecessor of Hellzapoppin'. Comedy teams traditionally had a straight man and a stooge. However, Olsen and Johnson both took on the comic role, goodnaturedly chuckling their way through the steady barrage of gunshots, explosions, props plummeting to earth, intrusions from other performers and input from the audience. In 1938, they mounted their revue Hellzapoppin. Sophisticated Broadway audiences were unprepared for such chaos: stray props came out of nowhere, comic characters were planted in the audience and disrupted the action, Olsen and Johnson dashed on and off the stage in crazy costumes and indulged in cheerfully earthy humor, chorus girls lost their skirts, and vaudeville acts did their trick specialties. The show never played the same way twice. On some nights songs would be preempted by jokes, and on others jokes would be interrupted by songs. In 1941, Universal Pictures decided to commit Hellzapoppin to film (unlike the musical, including an apostrophe in the title), with plenty of crazy and sometimes innovative gags: A cab driver literally goes to hell, with Olsen and Johnson as his reluctant passengers. A serious song by Robert Paige and Jane Frazee is interrupted when a title card crashes on the screen, advising one Stinky Miller to go home. Man-chasing Martha Raye pursues Mischa Auer, who finds himself suddenly stripped down to his underwear and running a mock track meet. The film goes out of frame, and Olsen and Johnson try to correct the problem themselves. Despite Universal's insistence on a then- customary romance and a 'serious plot', somewhat diluting the Olsen and Johnson onslaught, Hellzapoppin is still fresh and funny. Copyright issues involving the original stage production have forced the film version out of general circulation in the United States, although a European DVD has entered circulation. The film version treated the show as a work in progress: Olsen and Johnson step out of the picture, argue with the projectionist (and get scenes from other movies inserted into theirs by him) stop the action to interact with the audience and sabotage their own show within the movie by using optical movie effects. This creative use of the film medium got Hellzapoppin' listed by theyshootpictures.com as one of the 1,000 most innovative films ever made. Universal made three more comedies with the team. Crazy House (1943) had Olsen and Johnson running amok through the Universal studio and evacuating the staff, including Universal regulars Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, Johnny Mack Brown, and Andy Devine. When Olsen and Johnson present themselves at the head office with the announcement \\"Universal's most sensational comedy team outside!\\", the studio chief replies, \\"Oh, Abbott and Costello! Send them right in!\\"Cullen, Frank, Vaudeville Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol. 2, 2007, Taylor & Francis Group Publishing, pg. 848. In Ghost Catchers (1944), Ole and Chic help singer Gloria Jean make her Carnegie Hall debut despite strange happenings in a spooky old house. See My Lawyer (1945) was a patchwork of vaudeville acts, with Olsen and Johnson noticeably absent from most of the proceedings. After completing this last film, Olsen and Johnson resumed their stage career, mounting variations of Hellzapoppin'. Hellzapoppin Olsen and Johnson with comedian Harry Langdon (center). Although Olsen and Johnson were a leading act in vaudeville, their greatest achievement was their \\"legitimate theater\\" production of Hellzapoppin. Assembled and produced by Olsen and Johnson, Hellzapoppin opened at New York's 46th Street Theatre on September 22, 1938, and ran for 1,404 performances, transferring to the Winter Garden Theatre mid- run.The Vaudevillians by Anthony Slide, Arlington House, 1981, p.111. The show had its start in a revue called Monkey Business wherein the team began developing their signature style of observing and commenting on the lunacy taking place around them. The gags and comic premises were borrowed from classic variety entertainment, but Olsen and Johnson put an original spin on the material through their inspired improvisation in live performance. Described as a rule-breaking exercise in hysteria, Hellzapoppin was a comic amalgam of the best--or worst--of vaudeville and burlesque. It gloried in the broadest type of comedy, with no sketch too lowbrow to be included. Technically a musical because it included a score by lyricist Charles Tobias and composer Sammy Fain, it was best known for its crazy combination of comedy acts, which included clowns, midgets, and animals. Stylistically, the show consistently broke the fourth wall, using shills, plants, and zany audience- participation gags. It also made heavy use of prop comedy, including rubber snakes, clotheslines filled with laundry, and breakaway pants, as well as electric buzzers hidden inside some of the seats.Cullen, Frank, Vaudeville Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol. 2, 2007, Taylor & Francis Group Publishing, pg. 846 Olsen and Johnson's shows were so popular that the team franchised them, with road companies headlining similar vaudeville acts and comedians. (The 1942 road company of Hellzapoppin starred Jay C. Flippen and Happy Felton in the Olsen and Johnson roles. The 1949 Australian tour starred Don de Leo and George Mayo as ‘Olsen and Johnson’).  Later Broadway productions  In December 1941, Olsen and Johnson returned to Broadway with a new revue, Sons O' Fun, which offered the same frenzied assortment of old gags and new songs. After this show had run its course, Olsen and Johnson mounted yet another variation on Hellzapoppin, this one titled Laffing Room Only (1944). Their final Broadway show was the 1950 production Pardon Our French, introducing their \\"discovery,\\" French singer Denise Darcel. Unlike the previous Olsen and Johnson hits, Pardon Our French ran only three months, closing on January 6, 1951. Television On the set of the show In 1949 NBC Television hired Olsen and Johnson to star in an ambitious variety show, Fireball Fun for All. It was hard to adapt Olsen and Johnson's unpredictable, prop-laden humor to a rigid time slot. Surviving kinescopes of the expensive, short-lived show demonstrate just how hard everyone tried to recapture the old, large-scale Hellzapoppin' magic under the limitations of live television. At least the series reflected on the stars' achievement: they had now performed in every form of popular entertainment. The team tried TV again, appearing semi-regularly on NBC's All-Star Revue. Their last regular TV series was ABC's 1957 children's series Popsicle Five Star Comedy. Seen Saturday evenings, the short-lived series also featured ventriloquists Paul Winchell and Senor Wences and cartoonist-storyteller Bob Bean. (All-Star Revue is listed in The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs: 1946 to 1979 by Vincent Terrance, published by Arlington House; Popsicle Five Star Comedy is referenced in Children's Television: The First 35 Years: Live, Taped and Filmed Shows by George Woolery, published by Scarecrow Press.) Olsen and Johnson continued to preside over rowdy revues into the 1950s, mostly in Las Vegas. On 21 June 1953 they appeared together as the \\"Mystery Guests\\" on What's My Line?. In the late 1950s illness forced Johnson to retire from the hectic show-business lifestyle, while Olsen continued to work as a solo performer. When Milton Berle was hosting NBC's Jackpot Bowling, Ole Olsen was on hand to play straight to Berle's antics. This was actually a surprise for Olsen, as his live comic routine was interrupted by Ralph Edwards and a This Is Your Life tribute. The flabbergasted Olsen greeted family and friends, with frequent breaks for time-honored O & J sight gags. The final guest was Chic Johnson, who ran on-camera in his familiar stage costume and joyfully reunited with his old friend and partner. Johnson died in 1962; Olsen, less than a year later. The two partners had always been close and their final resting places (in Las Vegas) are adjacent. Revivals Olsen and Johnson's comedy style has often been imitated (most successfully by Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In). Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, featured a stage presentation of Hellzapoppin featuring comics Soupy Sales and Will B. Able; the show closed after only a few performances. A one-shot TV revival in 1972 was produced by ABC and co-starred Jack Cassidy and Ronnie Schell. Jerry Lewis secured the stage rights and NBC planned to telecast his version of Hellzapoppin' live in 1980. The show closed prematurely, however, and never aired on television.

Biography Early life Mahlon Bush Hoagland was born in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. in 1921 to Hudson Hoagland and Anna Hoagland. Hudson was an American physiologist who was known for co-founding the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology with Gregory Pincus. He graduated from The Hill School in 1940 and attended Williams College, and in 1948 received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School with intentions of becoming a pediatric surgeon. After a bout with tuberculosis, Hoagland was forced to change career directions and became involved with research. Hoagland took a research position at Massachusetts General Hospital in the lab of Paul Zamecnik, where he researched and detailed the role of transfer RNA in forming proteins. From 1953-1967 Hoagland served as an associate professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School. In 1967, upon leaving Harvard he was appointed professor in the biochemistry department at the Dartmouth Medical School. In 1970, Hoagland became scientific director of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, retiring in 1985 after 15 years in the directorship. Work By the time Hoagland had joined Huntington Laboratories, his colleagues there were well known for their work in protein synthesis.Horace Freeland Judson, The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology (Simon & Schuster, 1979) In the early 1950s Hoagland and his associates were able to show that polypeptide synthesis occurs on ribosomes. They did this by giving a rat injections of radioactive amino acids, waiting for a defined period of time, extracting the liver, and examining sub-cellular fractions for radioactivity. He found that after longer periods of times (hours, days) radioactively labeled proteins were present in all subcellular fractions. However, if they allowed less time to pass, radioactivity was found in only certain particles, which they deemed the sites of proteins synthesis. These particles were named ribosomes. During their experiments with rat liver cells, Hoagland and Zamecnik noticed that in the presence of ATP, amino acids associate with heat soluble RNA, which was later named transfer RNA (tRNA). This amino acid and tRNA complex was later called aminoacyl-tRNA. Hoagland's major contribution to the laboratory was in his work with amino acid activating enzymes. He discovered that certain enzymes were required to activate amino acids so they could associate with tRNA molecules and eventually be incorporated into new protein molecules. These enzymes were named aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Incidentally, this lab's discovery of tRNA supported the theory of complementarity (molecular biology) proposed by Watson and Crick. He was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1976. Mahlon Hoagland's other work involved the carcinogenic effects of beryllium, biosynthesis of coenzyme A, as well as liver regeneration and control.

It contained thousands of graves of prominent citizens of Tallinn and stood from 1774 to shortly after World War II, when it was completely flattened and destroyed by the Soviet occupation authorities governing the country at the time.Rein Taagepera, Estonia: Return to Independence, Westview Press 1993, , page 189 The former cemetery is now a public park. Origins and use Between 1771 and 1772, Catherine the Great, empress of the Russian Empire, issued an edict which decreed that from that point on, no-one who died (regardless of their social standing or class origins) was to be buried in a church crypt or churchyard; all burials were to take place in new cemeteries to be built throughout Russia, located outside town boundaries. These measures were intended to overcome the congestion of urban church crypts and graveyards, and were prompted by a number of outbreaks of highly contagious diseases linked to inadequate burial practices in urban areas, especially the black plague, which had led to the 1771 Plague Riot in Moscow. The cemetery at Kopli was founded in 1774 on the outskirts of Tallinn. It was divided into two sections: the western part was used for the deceased belonging to the St. Nicholas' Church parish, while the eastern part was reserved for those of the St. Olaf's Church parish. The cemetery served as a burial ground for over 170 years for almost all Baltic Germans who died in the city between 1774 and 1944. In 1939, it contained thousands of well-kept graves of many prominent citizens of Tallinn. Final burials Burials at the cemetery were drastically reduced after Adolf Hitler's forced transfer, under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, of tens of thousands of Baltic Germans from Estonia and Latvia to areas in western Poland in late 1939. Burials at the cemetery continued on a much smaller scale until 1944, principally among those Baltic Germans who had refused to leave the region. Destruction by Soviet authorities Shortly after World War II, during the second occupation of Baltic states, the suburb of Kopli, because of its strategic position as a base for the Red Army on the Gulf of Finland, was turned into a restricted zone for the Soviet military and closed to the public. Around 1950-1951, the cemetery was entirely flattened by Russian Soviet authorities. Gravestones were used to build walls along the ports and sidewalks in other parts of the city and no trace of the cemetery was left standing. Soviet administration also destroyed two further 17th- and 18th- century cemeteries in the city, in Kalamaja and Mõigu, which belonged to the ethnic Estonian and Baltic German communities. In contrast, the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, also established in the 18th century, south of the old town of Tallinn, was left standing. Current status Presently, the former area of the cemetery is a public park, with no immediate visible indication of its previous status. The only surviving evidence of those who were interred there consists of the parish registers of burials and some old detailed maps of the area in the Tallinn city archives.

The town might have taken over the position as a local power center from a location in Stafsinge. It was then Danish, and would remain so up till 1645, with some minor interruptions. From the 14th century and on to the Northern Seven Years' War (1563-1570) a second town, Ny-Falkenberg (New Falkenberg) was located close to the town. The fort from which the fiefdom had been run was destroyed by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson's troops in 1434, and would not be rebuilt, hence marking the end of the fiefdom. The town gained its market rights in 1558. Better infrastructure in the latter part of the 19th century, meant that the town break a long period of stagnation and see some substantial growth. The industralisation process started at the late 19th/early 20th century. In the 20th century the town has continued to growth, both in terms of population and size. For the first time it has come to include areas on the southern strand of river Ätran. The middle ages the fort remains. { align=left  Year Population - 1770 551 - 1810 636 - 1850 953 - 1854 941 - 1890 1 760 - 1910 4 452 - 1930 5 604 - 1950 8 667 - 1970 13 476 - 1995 18 308 - colspan=2Source (mainly): CyberCity } In the late 13th century, the Danish king built a fort on the southern strand of river Ätran. It was given the name Falkenberg (Falcon + mountain), and would late give the town its name. It is not known wherefrom the fort got its name. What is known is that falconry has taken place in the area. Notes in Hallandia antiqua et hodierna, pointing out a specific hill as the Falcon mountain, is unverified. The northern strand of the river was from time to time Norwegian or Swedish. There a trading centre known as Ätraby developed. Its church Saint Lawrence church, was built at around 1300. The settlement might have developed in competition with an earlier power center in Stafsinge. The settlement might have existed in 1256, as Haakon IV of Norway destroyed a market town (Kaupstadh) at river Ätran. Whether this market town was Falkenberg or the earlier power center is unknown. Several royal meeting took place in or around Falkenberg in the late 13th/early 14th century. On these meetings marriages were negotiated. It was from Falkenberg that Christopher issued the market town rights for Halmstad. The fort was destroyed by the men of Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson in 1434 and was not rebuilt. However, the trading centre took over its name. From the 14th century and on to the Northern Seven Years' War (1563-1570) a second town, Ny-Falkenberg (New Falkenberg), was located close to the town. Its main street was located where Tröingevägen is today, north east of the hospital.

Falkenberg was, together with the rest of the county, ceded to Sweden in the mid 17th century. By then, it had been heavily affected by the many wars which since the 13th century had ravaged the county. Christer Bonde, president of the Swedish National Board of Trade described it as a \\"minor stain\\", after his tour of inspection in the conquered territories. He was not alone. Several other notes from this time mentions the town in similar, unfavourable, words. The town had then, and would for quite some time, about 200 people, mainly working with farming. Farming and fishing continued to be the major trade in the town into the mid 19th century. The Swedish state had an intention to limit the number of towns with the right to trade internationally (Sw. stapelstäder). Hence, the town lost these rights in 1660, had them returned in 1679 (during the Scanian War), and finally lost them again in 1724. A long battle with the state about the rights ensued. It would take until 1866 before the town regained the rights. In 1660 the down suffered a major fire, in which 16 of the houses was lost. It was followed by several fires in the first half of the 18th century (1706, 1708, 1718, 1725, 1732 and 1743). As a result of all these fires, thatched roofs were forbidden. They were often replaced with brick roofs. The last major fire took place in 1841. A register of the townspeople's occupations in 1737 reveals two bakers, a glassmaker, a gold smith, a gloves maker, a hat maker, a wheel maker, a copper smith, a potter, a mason, a painter, , three shoemakers, two tailors, a butcher, three smiths, four lumbermen, a weaver, four inn owners, twelve seamen and fishers and twelve workers. From the 18th century and onwards more and more potteries were built, the most well known Törngrens krukmakeri. Salmon fishing has in all likelihood been carried out in river Ätran since ancient times. It is mentioned from the 16th century and onwards. Hallandia antiqua et hodierna describes it as the best in Halland. The good fishing-waters draw many Englishmen to the town in the 19th. This early tourism is described in Days in Falkenberg - A Record of Sport in Sweden, a book written in 1884 by A. M. Wilkinsson, a lawyer from London. Among those fishing were Sir Hyde Parker and a son to Thomas Babington Macaulay. At the end of the 19th century the town gained about one fifth of its revenue from the fishing. Nowadays the revenue from the fishing is estimated to be of the order of five million SEK.Falkenbergs kommun: Ätranlaxen The Falkenberg Bridge was built in the mid 18th century. The current town hall (Falkenbergs town hall) was built in 1826, although earlier town halls had existed at the same spot. It was suggested in the early 1860s that the town should have a town council. Up until then the decisions had been made at assemblies, where all those attending and with a right to vote could do so. After some early opposition the town council was introduced in 1865. The town starts to grow (1860-) Photo of Falkenberg in the 1860s. Falkenberg Bridge can be found in the centre of the image. From the 1820s and onwards action had been taken to improve the state of the Port of Falkenberg. In the mid 19th century the need for a better harbour became desperate. Hallands Ångbåtsaktiebolag (Halland Steamboat Inc.) had begun traffic along the westcoast, but refused to stop in Falkenberg, due to the poor state of the port. At the same time the importance of the port grew, as it was needed for the export of timber from the inland. The maximum depth in the harbour was 9 feet (2.7 meters), and it was only 6 feet (1.8 meters) at the quay. Hence, the boats often had to anchor at some distance out at sea, where the goods were transferred to smaller boats, which were able to use the harbour. The limited depth was caused by sand drifting towards the harbour, due to underwater streams. In order to increase the depth a dredge was bought, at a cost of 9 000 Swedish riksdaler. Over the coming decades the dredge struggled to keep the depth. In 1890 the port once again lost the steamboat traffic. In 1909-1910 the northern wharf was extended and in the end of 1910 money was put up to build a 2,000 meter long breakwater and to extend the southern wharf. These projects took until 1926 to finish. These works proved successful, as the depth was increased to five meters and the dredge could be rented out. The first plans for a railway between Falkenberg and Halmstad were discussed in 1881. As a result, Mellersta Hallands järnväg AB was formed, seated in Falkenberg. The stock company was successful in issuing stocks. With support by the Halland County Council and the state it would not only build the track, but also extend it to Varberg. The work on the railway began in 1884, and in 1885 it reached Falkenberg. Two different stretches were suggested; one longer, northern, which would pass through the upper parts of Storgatan and Marknadsgatan; one short, southern, which would pass Tullkammaregatan and Storgatan. The latter alternative was cheaper and was chosen. As a consequence, the railway would pass through the remains of the old fort. The railway proved to be an economic success. When it was nationalised in 1895, it gave the town a return of 58 725 Swedish kronor on a 130 500 kronor investment. The first telegraph station was opened in 1869. The town was connected to the national telephone grid in 1894. As the communications became better and better, the town gained a stronger role as the chief town for the surrounding countryside. AB. Dan. Lundgrens leather factory was founded in 1834, and was for a long time one of the largest companies in the town. Bryggeriaktiebolaget Falken was founded in 1896, and has since been one of the largest employers in the town. Doktorspromenaden (The Doctor's Walk) was constructed in 1862. Falkenbergs kommun: Gustaf Adam Ehrengranat (1820-1877) The registers tell about barber-surgeons in the towns since the 17th century. From 1849 it had a town medical officer. The county council granted money for a cottage hospital in 1878, which was inaugurated four years later. The hospital facilities grew in numbers in the early 20th century, and in 1911 the county council decided to make it a general hospital, with a capacity of 34 beds. The Herting mansion was bought by the town in 1901. The purchase was motivated by plans to build a hydro power plant; plans that were realized a few years later. The power plant has since been expanded step by step. Initially the power was too low to keep up with the demand, and the electricity had to be rationed. The problem was rectified by said expansions, as well as with the purchase of electricity from the Yngeredsfors power station, upstreams Ätran. Following the threat of a cholera epidemic in 1892 an epidemic hospital was built in 1897. The building was used until 1925. It does nowadays belong to the Falkenbergs gymnasieskola and is known as the yellow villa. The building could not always host all the patients, and in those cases the Herting Sawmill was used to cater for the rest. Between 1925 and 1950 the epidemic hospital was located at Tallgläntan, however from 1933 and onwards it was for children only. The 20th century has seen the town develop as a beach resort, in particular along Skrea Strand. By 1914 it had 14 cabins, by 1928 it had increased to 300 and nowadays there are about 1,600.Arkitekten (juni 2005): Alla lika inför badet From the 1930s and onwards some restaurants and a hotel has been established in the area to cater for the needs of the tourists. The town begun to expand administratively in 1907 when Herting was incorporated, albeit with protests from Skrea, to which it had previously belonged. Further incorporation took place in 1936–1937, when Arvidstorp, become a part of the town. In that case the feelings had been the opposite, as Arvidstorp had struggled for over 20 years to become part of the town. In 1950 a minor part of Vinberg was transferred to the town and in 1951-1952 the incorporation of Skrea took place. As a result of the 1971 municipal reform the town is now the seat of Falkenberg Municipality. A new town hall was built in 1960. Falkenbergs Football Club was founded in 1894 as the town's first major sports club. It was followed in 1906 by Falkenberg Women Gymnastics Club. Falkenberg Arena was built in 1921. Falkenbergs FF was founded in 1928 and Falkenbergs BTK in 1925. In the 1940s and 1950s a heated debate took place on whether to broad the old Falkenberg Bridge or not. The matter was taken to national level and as an end result it was decided to leave the bridge untouched, but increase its capacity by building a footbridge, thereby leaving the entire bridge to the cars, without the need to share it with the pedestrians.

The prehistoric royal site of Emhain Macha was burnt and plundered and ultimately this territory would re-emerge as part of the kingdom or federation of Airgíalla. The Battle of Achadh Leith-dheirg was fought in the territory of \\"Fearnmhagh\\", according to 19th-century Celtic scholar John O'Donovan. The place of the battle has been disputed between Fearn-mhagh, County Monaghan and Aghaderg, near Loughbrickland, County Down. Sources for the Battle of Achadh Leith-dheirg The 17th-century historian Geoffrey Keating in his \\"History of Ireland\\", in a stylized narrative of events, states: The Annals of the Four Masters, in the 19th-century translation by John O'Donovan (scholar), in a more perfunctory manner states: \\"The age of Christ 331. The battle of Achadh-leithdheirg, in Fearmhagh, [was fought] by the three Collas against the Ulstermen\\".... and in a note adds, \\"This place, situated in the territory of Fearnmagh, now the barony of Farney, in the county of Monaghan, has not been identified.\\" A footnote in Lebor na gCeart, published by the Celtic Society in 1847, contains a more expansive commentary regarding the location of Achadh Leith-dheirg: In summary, the predominant facts that emerge from any review of the battle, are that the Three Collas were victorious in the battle(s) of Achadh Leith-dheirg in \\"Fearnmagh\\" and that they drove the Ulaid beyond the Glen Righe. The Three Collas took from the Ulaid the land west of Glen Righe and Loch nEathach (Lough Neagh). At the Glen Righe, the Three Collas stopped and returned westwards to destroy Emhain Macha. The Three Collas did not invade or ever hold the land east/beyond the formidable boundary of the Glen Righe. Also, the \\"Carn of Achadh leth-derg\\" may not have been the battle site, but rather the encampment of the Three Collas. King John's Castle - Carlingford lough - where the Glen Righe enters the Irish sea The Glen Righe: The King's valley When the last great ice caps started receding northwards some ten thousand years ago, Ireland arose once more from a frozen slumber. Great torrents of water were released by the melting ice. Lough Neagh slowly shrugged off vast quantities of this meltwater by flooding the surrounding lowlands. Watercourses which are now merely streams were then voluminous torrents, gushing across the land.Upper River Bann enters lough Neagh at the northern end of Glen Righe However between nineteen and thirteen thousand years before the present, during the last glacial period, the ice sheets flowed from Lough Neagh in a south-easterly direction. They eroded the under lying bedrock over which they travelled, dramatically reshaping the landscape into U-shaped valleys and cirques. When eventually the last ice caps receded the torrential meltwaters poured into the contoured land, adding to the swollen rivers. Between the mouth or flood plain of the upper River Bann, where it flows into Lough Neagh and the fjord of Carlingford Lough where the River Clanrye empties into the Irish sea, lies one such u-shaped valley - the Glen Righe - an Gleann Righe. This immense valley of bog, lough and river would become a natural land boundary for centuries. It would become the dividing line in 331AD after the battle of Achadh Leith- dheirg between the new conquerors - the Three Collas and the remaining lands of the Ulaid. It would become in the seventeenth century the dividing line between the newly formed County Armagh and County Down and in the eighteenth century it would become the naturally occurring route of the Newry Canal. Battle of Achadh Leith-dheirg - the disputed sites *Aghaderg parish (civil) - county Down *Barony of Dartree - county Monaghan *Barony of Farney - county Monaghan Aghaderg civil parish. County Down Drumsallagh - Aghaderg parish Aghaderg is a civil parish mainly in the Barony of \\"Iveagh Upper, Upper Half\\" and partially within the Barony of \\"Iveagh Lower, Lower Half\\" in the county of Down, Province of Ulster. Within the bounds of Aghaderg parish are the remains of many sites of great archaeological interest, from stone circles to hill top forts and settlements along river valleys. Lisnagade hillfort, the ancient standing stones named \\"The Three Sisters\\" at Greenan and parts of the Black Pig's Dyke are all within its boundary. Aghaderg parish lies within a drumlin belt landscape and encompasses the historic settlements of Loughbrickland and Scarva where King William III encamped. The village of Loughbrickland is renowned for its ancient crannog. Iveagh-Upper:Upper barony Aghaderg parish is bounded on the west and separated from county Armagh by the Newry Canal – which follows the path of the u-shaped valley from the mouth of upper River Bann at lough Neagh to Carlingford Lough known as the Glen Righe. This great swampy valley remained an almost impenetrable boundary for many centuries, however it did permit a seasonal though highly precarious route across at specific \\"passes\\".. These passes, in later years would become known as: Poyntzpass, Scarva pass, jerretspass, Terryhoogan pass. These passes, though treacherous, seasonal and highly demanding may have allowed access to an invading army approaching from the west. The two earliest recorded forms of the name Aghaderg - \\"Uchderc\\", concerning the site of a battle in AD 1147, between the Ulaid and Cenél nEógain allied with Airgíalla, remain questionable. The indigenous explanation around the early eighteenth century for the name of the parish implicates the old church of Drumsallagh. Local tradition declared that numerous holy men had been killed by the Danes, who destroyed the church and monastery, and that afterwards this place became called Aghdurg, ‘the red or bloody ford’ - the boundary stream running close by the site. Most early spellings of Aghaderg have a vowel after Agh-, suggesting achadh - ‘field’ rather than ucht - ‘hill-breast’ or áth ‘ford’. According to \\"Placenamesni.org\\" \\"The second element is probably dearg ‘red’, and the final syllable appearing as -rig in some forms up to 1834 could be explained as the epenthetic vowel pronounced in Irish between the r and g of dearg. Thus the name would be Achadh Dearg ‘red field’, the Irish form given in the 17th century (LCAB).\\" Barony of Dartree - Barony of Farney - county Monaghan The battle was fought in Farney in 331 AD according to the Annals of the Four Masters (O'Donavon translation). In later sections of the Annals, Farney is spelt Fernmaighe in the Gaelic language - and Fearnmaighe in the English translation. Two baronies of county Monaghan, whose histories are deeply entangled, lay claim to \\"Farney\\", namely Dartree and Farney. The present county of Monaghan, in the early medieval era was part of the more extensive kingdom of Mugdorna \\\\- the tribe of Mugdornai: from which the barony of Cremorne derives its name. In this period Fernmhagh was centred in north west Monaghan around Loch Uaithne - Lough Ooney. Knockmany Hill - overlooking the Clogher valley The Annals of the Four Masters (for the year 849) say that \\"Caireall, son of Ruadhrach, lord of Lough Uaithne, was slain by the Conaille.\\" A footnote by O'Donovan describes Lough Ooney as follows: Peadar Livingstone, in The Monaghan Story, states Also from the same publication Livingstone further states: The preserving of a name that formerly belonged to another place is an occurrence frequent in Irish topography. Twelfth century expansion and migration Inniskeen round tower, Monaghan By the late 11th century the airgillia kingdom of Ui Chremthainn was controlled by the leading family of the Fir Fernmaige, using the surname of Ua Cerbaill. Due to Cenél nEógain pressure the Ui Chremthainn power base which had centred on Clogher was shifting south west into Monaghan. By early in the twelfth century the Ua Cerbhaill under the powerful political and religious reformer - King Donnchadh ua Cerbhaill controlled the ancient lands of the mugdornai. Donnchadh ua Cerbhaill (O'Carroll) endowed the establishment of Mellifont Abbey and under his kingship the airgillia federation would play an immense role in twelfth century developments in Ireland. As the twelfth century progressed the Ua Cherbaill expansion continued south easterly and their power base shifted from Clogher. Contemporary with this shift may have been the relocation of the ~ \\"Fir Fernmaighe\\" - Farney, from their original historically associated location of Lough Uaithne/Ooney into the south east region of modern Monaghan which now is known as the barony of Farney. The Dioceses established at the Synod of Ráth Breasail laid sold foundation for church establishment but many changes had occurred in the decades following as ua Cherbhaill expansion continued into County Louth, Donnchadh ua Cerbhaill instigated the bishop of Louth or Airgillia, while that of the Bishop of Clogher temporarily fell into disuse. After the battle - The disputed Sites Aghaderg history after the battle The territory that encompassed Aghaderg parish in the centuries after the battle would evolve as the Ulaid fellowship of the Uí Echach Cobo. The territory lying directly west - as that of the Airghialla federation. To the north lay the lands of Dál nAraidi. While to the east the Dál Fiatach held sway. Modern county Monaghan baronies In the \\"Collectanea de rebus hibernicis\\", (1770) the baronies of Monaghan are noted as: \\"Dartry, Monaghan, Cremorne, Trough, Donamayne.\\" The modern barony of Farney was titled as Donamayne. The barony of Farney is not recorded in \\" civil and ecclesiastical topography >\\"(1806): instead it is referenced as - \\"Donaghmoyne\\". Again in \\"A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\\"(1810) Donaghmoyne is listed as occupying barony. The barony of Farney appears, by at least 1833, in Gortons \\"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\\" Dartree and Farney history after the battle The territory surrounding these locations would become known as Oriel; a highly important federation of the Airgilla. In the centuries that followed the battle, the territory to the north-west of Airgialla would belong to the Cenél nEógain, the territory east of Airgialla - to the Ulaid, to the south lay the lands of the southern Uí Néill, while to the south west lay the Uí Briúin of Brefnie. Achaidh Leith-dheirg - In the Valley of the Black Pig's Dyke In the barony of Dartree, county Monaghan, some five miles south of Clones lies the parish of Currin: through which runs a six-mile remnant of the ancient Black Pig's Dyke or \\"worm ditch\\". This prehistoric fortification of raised earthworks and palisades, on south facing inclines of drumlin hills, has long been regarded as a defensive formation and territorial border. This section of the Black Pig's Dyke is roughly eight miles south of loch Uaithne/Ooney the ancient capital of Fernmhagh. At the battle of Achaidh Leith-dheirg the forces of the Three Collas had to breach the defences of the Ulaid and this breakthrough must have occurred somewhere along the Fernmhagh- Ulaid border: along the Black Pig's Dyke. Again this advance of the Three Collas would logically occur at the weakest point of the defence line. One example of which is - an ancient highway. According to Colm Ó Lochlainn an ancient road from Ulster ran south from Tullyhogue Fort and Clogher; then through the Black Pig's Dyke, branching near Cornapaste (townland) Currin parish and on to Belturbet, Ballyconnell and so to Connaught in the west of Ireland. Aghareagh townlandThe Black Pig's Dyke/Worm Ditch runs for roughly six miles west–east through Currin parish. Starting at the River Finn its course can be traced across drumlins and loughs until it disappears into a bog near magherashaghry fort on the river Bunnoe. At a point where the townlands of Aghareagh West and Corrinary meet the earthworks curves into a slight valley before turning abruptly north for some one hundred metres, then continuing east. The etymology of the townland name of Corrinary would equate to: corr = a round hill, faraire = a watchman. This may have been the weakest point of the earthworks; a pass in the valley allowing an ancient road, watched over by warriors. In the Onomasticon Goedelicum mention is made of a placename in Ulster described as Currach leithdeirg - \\"the red bog\\". In the townland of Corrinary lies a swamp known locally as - \\"the red bog\\". Through this weak point in the earthworks defence the army of the Three Collas may have made their breakthrough. The Ulaid would no doubt have been aware of the advance of the Three Collas and although unable to stem the breakthrough at Corrinary, they would have mustered their forces at a very close and advantageous location. Some half mile due north of the townland of Corrinary there lies a tapestry landscape of interwoven plains, drumlins and steep hills, in a townland called Carnroe-Carn Rua. Rua and Derg have much the same meaning = Red. On the top of Carnroe are the remains of \\"Giants Graves\\": traditionally the burial grounds of fallen leaders. \\"The Collas and the Connaughtmen... marched to the Carn of Achadh leth-derg, in Fernmagh.

It is a fictionalized story about a real historical figure, Dummy Taylor, a deaf baseball player who played professional baseball in the years 1900‒1908.  Plot summary  In 1911, Taylor, a former big-league pitcher, has been sent down to the minor leagues at age 37 due to problems with his pitching arm. He longs for a second chance and approaches his former manager, John McGraw, about re-joining the New York Giants. Short of players, McGraw eventually agrees to take him on a post-season exhibition trip to play baseball in Cuba, where the political atmosphere is tense in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War. During the games in Cuba, Taylor is introduced to a promising Cuban prospect who is also deaf. Taylor encounters moral dilemmas as he balances his desire to return to the big leagues against difficult issues involving racism, discrimination, disability, fading dreams, and the sports philosophy of winning at any cost.

Biography  Born to a Protestant family of the bourgeoisie in Gard, Émilien Dumas was immersed from his early childhood in an atmosphere of learning and erudition. His father, a former merchant involved in agriculture, was an educated man. The native flora of Gard provided him with his first field of study. From 1815 to 1824, he studied at Morges, Switzerland, then at Basel, where his passion for the natural sciences matured. He returned to his homeland in 1824 following the death of his mother. Embarking on a career in the sciences, he went to Paris and studied at the Collège de France, the Ecole des Mines de Paris and the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, and with Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and Adrien-Henri de Jussieu. His education in the natural sciences was well rounded, and he threw himself with equal passion into Zoology, Mineralogy, and Botany, as well as engaging in the contemporary debate over Lamarckism. In 1828, he returned to Sommières, where he married Pauline Borel, a wealthy heiress from Orange, and daughter of a silk manufacturer. The same year, he unveiled a rich paleontological dig site at Pondres (Gard) whose human and animal remains fueled Lamarckist arguments, particularly in the field of Archaeozoology He surveyed his region with great patience and tenacity over a period of 20 years, to produce a geological map of the département of Gard. During a long voyage in the 1860s he studied the geography of southern Europe. As an avid collector, he cultivated his curiosity throughout his life, and the Natural History Museum at Nîmes now preserves a large part of his numerous collections spanning the fields of Greek antiquities, botany, and geology. The missing piece in this portrait of the \\"Explorer of Gard\\" is his taste for theater and acting. He was a willing participant as well as observer, which was considered by his contemporaries as incompatible with his role as a scientist. He died on September 21, 1873 in Ax-sur-Ariège.

This technique has been used to enable women to postpone pregnancy to a later date – whether for medical reasons such as cancer treatment or for social reasons such as employment or studying. Several studies have proven that most infertility problems are due to germ cell deterioration related to aging. Surprisingly, the uterus remains completely functional in most elderly women. This implies that the factor which needs to be preserved is the woman's eggs. The eggs are extracted, frozen and stored. The intention of the procedure is that the woman may choose to have the eggs thawed, fertilized, and transferred to the uterus as embryos to facilitate a pregnancy in the future. The procedure's success rate (the chances of a live birth using frozen eggs) varies depending on the age of the woman, and ranges from 14.8 percent (if the eggs were extracted when the woman was 40) to 31.5 percent (if the eggs were extracted when the woman was 25). Indications Oocyte cryopreservation can increase the chance of a future pregnancy for three key groups of women: # those diagnosed with cancer who have not yet begun chemotherapy or radiotherapy; # those undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technologies who do not consider embryo freezing an option; and # those who would like to preserve their future ability to have children, either because they do not yet have a partner, or for other personal or medical reasons. Over 50,000 reproductive-age women are diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States.American Cancer Society (2001) Cancer facts and figures 2001. Atlanta: American Cancer Society. Retrieved on April 24, 2007. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are toxic for oocytes, leaving few, if any, viable eggs. Egg freezing offers women with cancer the chance to preserve their eggs so that they can attempt to have children in the future. Oocyte cryopreservation is an option for individuals undergoing IVF who object, either for religious or ethical reasons, to the practice of freezing embryos. Having the option to fertilize only as many eggs as will be utilized in the IVF process, and then freeze any remaining unfertilized eggs can be a solution. In this way, there are no excess embryos created, and there need be no disposition of unused frozen embryos, a practice which can create complex choices for certain individuals. Additionally, women with a family history of early menopause have an interest in fertility preservation. With egg freezing, they will have a frozen store of eggs, in the likelihood that their eggs are depleted at an early age. Method The egg retrieval process for oocyte cryopreservation is the same as that for in vitro fertilization. This includes one to several weeks of hormone injections that stimulate ovaries to ripen multiple eggs. When the eggs are mature, final maturation induction is performed, preferably by using a GnRH agonist rather than human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), since it decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate (in contrast to fresh cycles where usage of GnRH agonist has a lower live birth rate). The eggs are subsequently removed from the body by transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The procedure is usually conducted under sedation. The eggs are immediately frozen. The egg is the largest cell in the human body and contains a high amount of water. When the egg is frozen, the ice crystals that form can destroy the integrity of the cell. To prevent this, the egg must be dehydrated prior to freezing. This is done using cryoprotectants which replace most of the water within the cell and inhibit the formation of ice crystals. Eggs (oocytes) are frozen using either a controlled-rate, slow-cooling method or a newer flash-freezing process known as vitrification. Vitrification is much faster but requires higher concentrations of cryoprotectants to be added. The result of vitrification is a solid glass-like cell, free of ice crystals. Indeed, freezing is a phase transition. Vitrification, as opposed to freezing, is a physical transition. Realizing this fundamental difference, vitrification concept has been developed and successfully applied in IVF treatment with the first life birth following vitrification of oocytes achieved in 1999. Vitrification eliminates ice formation inside and outside of oocytes on cooling, during cryostorage and on warming. Vitrification is associated with higher survival rates and better development compared to slow-cooling when applied to oocytes in metaphase II (MII). Vitrification has also become the method of choice for pronuclear oocytes, although prospective randomized controlled trials are still lacking. During the freezing process, the zona pellucida, or shell of the egg can be modified preventing fertilization. Thus, currently, when eggs are thawed, a special fertilization procedure is performed by an embryologist whereby sperm is injected directly into the egg with a needle rather than allowing sperm to penetrate naturally by placing it around the egg in a dish. This injection technique is called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) and is also used in IVF. Immature oocytes have been grown until maturation in vitro, but it is not yet clinically available. Further comments in BBC news article: Success rates The percentage of transferred cycles is lower in frozen cycles compared with fresh cycles (approx. 30% and 50%). Such outcomes are considered comparable. In a 2013 meta-analysis of more than 2,200 cycles using frozen eggs, scientists found the probability of having a live birth after three cycles was 31.5 percent for women who froze their eggs at age 25, 25.9 percent at age 30, 19.3 percent at age 35, and 14.8 percent at age 40. Two recent studies showed that the rate of birth defects and chromosomal defects when using cryopreserved oocytes is consistent with that of natural conception.CNN April 16, 2007 . Retrieved on April 24, 2007 Recent modifications in protocol regarding cryoprotectant composition, temperature and storage methods have had a large impact on the technology, and while it is still considered an experimental procedure, it is quickly becoming an option for women. Slow freezing traditionally has been the most commonly used method to cryopreserve oocytes, and is the method that has resulted in the most babies born from frozen oocytes worldwide. Ultra-rapid freezing or vitrification represents a potential alternative freezing method. In the fall of 2009, The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) issued an opinion on oocyte cryopreservation concluding that the science holds “great promise for applications in oocyte donation and fertility preservation” because recent laboratory modifications have resulted in improved oocyte survival, fertilization, and pregnancy rates from frozen-thawed oocytes in IVF. The ASRM noted that from the limited research performed to date, there does not appear to be an increase in chromosomal abnormalities, birth defects, or developmental deficits in the children born from cryopreserved oocytes. The ASRM recommended that, pending further research, oocyte cryopreservation should be introduced into clinical practice on an investigational basis and under the guidance of an Institutional Review Board (IRB). As with any new technology, safety and efficacy must be evaluated and demonstrated through continued research. In October 2012, the ASRM lifted the experimental label from the technology for women with a medical need, citing success rates in live births, among other findings. However, they also warned against using it only to delay child-bearing. In 2014, a Cochrane systematic review about this topic was published. It compared vitrification (the newest technology) versus slow freezing (the oldest one). Key results of that review showed that the clinical pregnancy rate was almost 4 times higher in the oocyte vitrification group than in the slow freezing group, with moderate quality of evidence. Immature oocytes have been grown until maturation in vitro at a 10% survival rate, but no experiment has been performed to fertilize such oocytes. Cost The cost of the egg freezing procedure (without embryo transfer) in the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries varies in between $5,000 and $12,000. This does not include the fertility medications involved in the procedure which can cost between $4,000 and $5,000. The cost of egg storage can vary from $100 to more than $1,000. It is important for women to be aware that provisional health programs do not cover social egg freezing. Furthermore, no provinces provide funding for IVF after social egg freezing. Medical tourism may have lower costs than performing egg freezing in high-cost countries like the US. Some well established medical tourism and IVF countries such as Czech Republic, Ukraine and Cyprus offer egg freezing at competitive prices. It is a lower cost alternative to typical US options for egg freezing. Spain and the Czech Republic are popular destinations for this treatment. History Cryopreservation itself has always played a central role in assisted reproductive technology. With the first cryopreservation of sperm in 1953 and of embryos twenty five years later, these techniques have become routine. Dr Christopher Chen of Singapore reported the world's first pregnancy in 1986 using previously frozen oocytes. This report stood alone for several years followed by studies reporting success rates using frozen eggs to be much lower than those of traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques using fresh oocytes. Providing the lead to a new direction in cryobiology, Dr. Lilia Kuleshova was the first scientist to achieve vitrification of human oocytes that resulted in a live birth in 1999. Then recently, two articles published in the journal, Fertility and Sterility, reported pregnancy rates using frozen oocytes that were comparable to those of cryopreserved embryos and even fresh embryos. These newer reports affirm that oocyte cryopreservation technology is advancing. Almost 42,000 'slow frozen' (as opposed to 'vitrified') human embryo transfers were performed during 2001 in Europe (Andersen et al. 2005). In addition, it is estimated that between 300,000 and 500,000 successful human births have resulted worldwide from the transfer of previously ‘slow frozen’ embryos performed from the mid-1970s to 2006. Elective oocyte cryopreservation Elective oocyte cryopreservation, also known as social egg freezing, is non-essential egg freezing for the purpose of preserving fertility for delayed child-bearing when natural conception becomes more problematic. The frequency of this procedure has steadily increased since October 2012 when the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) lifted the 'experimental' label from the process. There was a spike in interest in 2014 when global corporations Apple and Facebook revealed they were introducing egg freezing as a benefit for their female employees.https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/17/356765423/silicon- valley-companies-add-new-benefit-for-women-egg-freezing This announcement was controversial as some women found it empowering and practical, while others viewed the message these companies were sending to women trying to have a successful long-term career and a family as harmful and alienating. A string of “egg freezing parties” hosted by third-party companies have also helped popularize the concept among young women.http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/09/egg_freezing_marketing_campaigns_lie_about_success_rates_of_this_fertility.html Social science research suggests that women use elective egg freezing to disentangle their search for a romantic partner from their plans to have children. In 2016, then US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the Department of Defense will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active duty service members, with the intention of preserving their ability to start a family even if they suffer certain combat injuries. There are still warnings for women using this technology to fall pregnant at an older age as the risk of pregnancy complications increases with a mother's age. However, studies have shown that the risk of congenital abnormalities in babies born from frozen oocytes is not increased further when compared to naturally conceived babies. Risks The risks associated with egg freezing relate to the administration of medications to stimulate the ovaries and the procedure of egg collection. The main risk associated with the administration of medications to stimulate the ovaries is ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is a transient syndrome in which there is increased permeability of the blood vessels, resulting in fluid loss from the vessels into the surrounding tissues. In most cases the syndrome is mild, with symptoms such as abdominal bloating, mild discomfort and nausea. In moderate OHSS there is increased abdominal bloating resulting in pain and vomiting. Reduced urine output may occur. Severe OHSS is serious with even further bloating so that the abdomen appears very distended, thirst and dehydration occur with minimal urine output. There may be shortness of breath and there is an increased risk of DVT and/or pulmonary embolism. Kidney and liver function can be compromised. Hospitalisation under specialist care is indicated. There is no treatment for OHSS, supportive care until the symptoms naturally resolve is required. If an hCG trigger has been used with no embryo transfer, OHSS usually resolves in 7–10 days. If an embryo transfer has occurred and pregnancy results, the symptoms may persist for several weeks. Doctors reduce the likelihood of OHSS occurring by decreasing the doses of gonadotropins (FSH) administered, using a GnRH agonist trigger (instead of an hCG trigger) and freezing all embryos for transfer rather than conducted a fresh embryo transfer. Risks associated with the egg collection procedure relate to bleeding and infection. The collection procedure involves passing a needle through the wall of the vagina into vascular stimulated ovaries. A small amount of bleeding is inevitable. In rare cases, there is excessive bleeding into the abdomen requiring surgery. It is important that women undergoing the procedure advise their specialist of all medications, including herbal supplements, they are using so the specialist can assess whether any of these medications will affect the ability of the blood to clot. In relation to infection, provided the woman does not have additional risk factors for infection (suppressed immune system, use of immunosuppressive medications or large ovarian endometriomas) the risk of infection is very low. One additional risk of the ovaries being temporarily increased in size is ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion occurs when an enlarged ovary twists around on itself, cutting off its blood supply. The condition is excruciatingly painful and requires urgent surgery to prevent the ischaemic loss of the ovary.

The company has historically been linked to Warsaw, and the company has strong historic roots regarding Polish tractor production history. It has also carried out some production of trolleybuses in a joint venture with the Ukrainian manufacturer Bogdan, and manufactures buses, coaches, trolleybuses in a joint venture with AMZ Kutno under the name Ursus Bus.  History   Early history  Ursus advertisement from 1914 C-45 The Ursus Factory was founded in Poland in 1893 on 15 Sienna Street, Warsaw, by three engineers and four businessmen. It began producing exhaust engines and then later trucks and metal fittings intended for the Russian Tsar. In 1930, the Ursus factory fell on hard times due to the world financial crisis and was nationalised under the Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne (National Engineering Works, PZInż), the Polish manufacturer of arms and vehicles. It then began producing military tractors, tanks and other heavy machinery for troops. During the German occupation of Poland in World War II the factory was controlled by FAMO and produced Panzer II, Marder II and Wespe AFVs. After the war, the Ursus Factory started producing the Ursus C-45, a copy of the German pre-war Lanz Bulldog tractor. During the 1950s, the Ursus factory began producing tractors using a Zetor-based design. By 1961, there was a growing need for tractors in Poland, but the tractors produced by the Ursus factory did not meet the needs of Polish agriculture. A bilateral agreement was created between Poland and Czechoslovakia, where Czechoslovakia would provide the Ursus factory with the parts necessary to enlarge and modernise the factory and in exchange, Poland would supply Czechoslovak factories with raw materials. The goal was to construct a joint tractor industry where Poland and Czechoslovakia would combine to produce 120,000 tractors per year, as in 1963 Poland was only producing 15,000. Solidarity Workers of the Ursus tractor factory played a large role in the solidarity movement in the 1970s and 1980s. On 25 June 1976 in response to a rise in food prices, the workers of Ursus, acting in solidarity with workers in Radom and many other areas, went on strike and blocked and destroyed parts of the main east-west and north-south rail lines leaving Warsaw. This was one of the largest and most disruptive strikes that occurred that day, and resulted in the prime minister announcing on television the withdrawal of the food price increase. In 1980, workers of the Ursus factory went on strike and spent the night at the factory to protest the detention of Jan Narozniak, a volunteer printing worker at the Warsaw chapter of Solidarity. Also in 1980, 16,000 workers threatened to stop coming to work on Saturdays in order to self-enforce the 5-day work week proclaimed by the Solidarity movement. In 1988, 200 workers in the Ursus factory occupied the plant canteen and demanded that the management petition for increased wages, the release of imprisoned workers, and the legalisation of Solidarity and the Independent Students' Association. Investment under Gierek The Ursus factory was the focus of an extensive investment initiative in the 1970s under Edward Gierek. Under this programme, large loans were taken from western banks for the purpose of importing modern equipment and methods that would cause expansion of Polish industry and growth of the Polish economy. In 1977, a 7.9 million dollar export-import bank loan and a 7 million dollar loan from private American banks were granted to the Ursus tractor factory for the purpose of purchasing machine tools from the Ingersoll Milling Machine Company of Rockford, Illinois, and Gleason Works in Rochester, New York. However, such investment programmes became inefficient and failed, leaving Poland with an immense debt. By 1980, 25 billion dollars were locked into inefficient, unfinished projects in Polish industry that were speculated to require an additional 50 billion dollars to complete. The Ursus Tractor Factory was one of the largest victims of this problem. By 1981, equipment that had been purchased in the West at the Ursus Factory amounted to 3,600 million złoty. Warehouse space at Ursus was filled with unused, unnecessary supplies, e.g. a stock of 1.6 million rarely used screws, and since construction of new warehouse space had stopped, other supplies were left to deteriorate outside. Gierek had invested nearly 1 billion dollars into a project of developing a modern Massey Ferguson model of tractor at Ursus, however due to licensing problems, these tractors could not be sold in the Western Bloc during the Cold War for political reasons, and in the Eastern Bloc neither because they were too expensive. Instead of the targeted production of 75,000 tractors per year, only 500 were made. Recent history Ursus 1224 Ursus 8014H Ursus C-3110 HL at Agritechnica 2017 fairs Ursus' tractor production declined throughout the 1990s, falling from 60,000 tractors per year in 1980 to about 16,000 tractors in 1995. The decline in production was due to the enormous debt that Ursus had contracted as a result of its expansion programme in the 1980s. The need to repay the debt blocked access to funds needed for the daily operations of the factory. In 1996, 550 million złoty, 80% of Ursus’ debt, owed to nearly 700 creditors, was written off. Tractor sales continued to decline to an all-time low of 1,578 units in 2006. URSUS Company was established in the years 1998–2003 as a consequence of restructuring and cooperation of PHZ \\"Bumar\\" Ltd., ZPC URSUS SA and Ursus Tractor Factory Ltd. The company is still producing Ursus tractors. Bumar Ltd became the main shareholder of Ursus Company, leading to Ursus becoming part of Bumar Industrial Group, which is marketing Ursus products both on foreign and domestic markets. In 2007, Uzel Holding of Turkey announced they were buying 51% of Ursus.Uzel buys 51 percent of Ursus , Turkish Daily News, September 12, 2007. Both Uzel and Ursus are, or were, licensees of AGCO's Massey Ferguson. In 2008 it was announced that Uzel had not kept up to its commitments, and TAFE and Pol-Mot were interested in buying. In 2011 Pol-Mot bought the Ursus Company from Bumar Ltd. Recently, the company is expanding its business in Central Europe and other countries, as well as planning to produce electric buses. Ursus City Smile In 2013, a joint venture between Ursus and the Ukrainian company Bogdan received an order for 38 trolleybuses for the Lublin, Poland, trolleybus system.Trolleybus Magazine No. 310 (July–August 2013), p. 106. UK: National Trolleybus Association. ISSN 0266-7452. The body-and-chassis shells were completed by Bogdan and shipped to an Ursus plant in Lublin, where Ursus would install the axles, electrical propulsion equipment (supplied by Cegelec), seats and other fittings, to complete the vehicles.

She retired from the United States Ski Team and professional skiing on March 26, 2010.  Biography  Kaylin Richardson followed her older brothers into ski racing while growing up in the Minneapolis area. Kaylin got started skiing in the Twin Cities with the Skijammers Ski and Snowboard School, a travelling ski program where her father was an instructor. She began racing at 9 with Team Gilboa at Hyland Hills. Richardson was named to the United States Ski Team for the 2003 season and quickly progressed through the ranks after winning back-to-back-to-back NorAm slalom titles in 2003; '04 and co-champion in '05. Richardson competed in her first World Cup race on Dec. 15, 2002 in Sestriere, Italy. She earned her first World Cup points in 2005 at the San Sicario Combined where she placed 16th. Richardson then expanded from a 'tech' skier to a four-event racer, earning FIS World Cup points in all five events in the 2005 and 2006 World Cup Seasons. Despite ankle trouble at the beginning of the 2006 season, Richardson was able to pull off top 15 and 20 results in slalom and giant slalom. Her quick rise through the World Cup through the '05-'06 seasons earned her a nomination to the 2006 Olympic Alpine Team for women's slalom and combined; she ended up being named to the Olympic combined team but left off the slalom roster for her fellow rising star Resi Stiegler.

Today, this former Nazi training centre is used by the 2nd Battalion, 12th Tank Brigade of the Polish Land Forces.  History  The groundbreaking for Ordensburg Krössinsee was on 22 April 1934. It was designed by the Cologne architect Clemens Klotz. The vast construction of rustic stone buildings with granite foundations was built at a cost of 20 million Reichsmarks, and the facility was officially dedicated on 24 April 1936. On 16 May 1941, the Ordensburg was renamed \\"Die Falkenburg am Krössinsee\\" (The Falcon Castle at Lake Krössin) by the Reichs Minister of Labor, Dr. Ley, Robert. On 29 June 1944, a small portion of the complex was destroyed by fire.

At the outbreak of World War II, a very high percentage of Junkers were killed in action. Daily routine Two courses of studies took place here from 1937–38 and 1938-39. Classes began each morning at 7 and included studies in philosophy, politics and world history. Afternoons were devoted to military drills, battle tactics, sports and equestrian techniques. The school was recognized for its outstanding equestrian program. The nearby lake provided the means for students to develop rowing and sailing skills. Hitler Youth In 1937, the cadres began sharing the facility with members of the Hitlerjungen or Hitler Youth. These boys between 12–18 years old eventually became the sole occupants of all three Order Castles with the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the start of World War II.

The capsule was opened by archaeologists in 2016, more than 80 years after it had been buried. Although the archeologists had long known that the time capsule was buried in the building foundation, they were not able to access it until 2016, and had to wade through groundwater, cut through thick concrete and evade potential German mines in order to reach it. Unlike many time capsules, the contents of which are often damaged or destroyed by water, the contents of this capsule were perfectly preserved. The contents included photographs (including images of Adolf Hitler), newspapers from 1934, coins, books (including two copies of Mein Kampf), and promotional and historical materials about what was then the town of Falkenburg. The contents were transferred to the National Museum in Szczecin for cataloguing, translation, preservation and display.

History George Augustus Stallings, Jr., then a priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, founded the Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation as a single congregation in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1989. It was an independent church for people who favored an Afrocentric but quasi-Catholic worship style. Within a few months, Imani Temple attracted ex-Catholic and ex- Protestant followers and former Roman Catholic clergy. It grew to a group of nine churches in several cities. Later it expanded to include 13 churches. In 1989, The Washington Post reported that a former altar boy at St. Teresa of Avila Church accused Stallings of sexual misconduct over a period of several months in 1977. Stallings said \\"I am innocent,\\" declining to answer questions. In a follow-up series of three articles in 1990, Post reporters Bill Dedman and Laura Sessions Stepp reported that concerns about Stallings' association with teenage boys had helped lead to his split with the Roman Catholic Church. Stallings's former pastoral assistant, who was 22 at the time, spoke publicly about having a two-year sexual relationship with him. In 2009 the archdiocese reached a $125,000 settlement with Gamal Awad, who said he was sexually abused at 14 by Stallings and a seminarian. By renouncing the authority of the Archbishop of Washington during the founding of the church, Stallings committed the canonical delict of schism. In recognition of this, in February 1990, the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal James Hickey, officially recognized that Stallings had, through his actions, excommunicated himself from the Catholic Church. In May 1990, Stallings was consecrated as an independent Catholic bishop and adopted the title of \\"Archbishop\\".

He is the most famous member of the Prefetti di Vico family. Biography Giovanni is mentioned for the first time in 1322. In 1337 he inherited the charge of prefect of Rome from his father Manfredi. The following year he entered Viterbo, killing his brother Faziolo, who had remained loyal to the Pope. Giovanni was named Imperial vicar of Latium by emperor Louis IV of Bavaria, confirmed in 1342 by Pope Clement VI. However, increasing contrasts with the latter drove him to an open rebellion in 1344, in which he expanded his lordship. After a short reconciliation, in 1347 Cola di Rienzo, senator of Rome, declared Giovanni a rebel and waged war against him. Assailed by 7,000 men, he was forced to sue for a surrender, and to renounce his title of prefect. Giovanni was again arrested in Rome, twice, but was freed with the fall of Cola di Rienzo. He thenceforth continued his ruthless policy of ravages against the Papal territories, refusing always to present himself in Avignon to respond for his deeds. In 1352 the Papal army attacked Viterbo; Giovanni resisted successfully in a siege of seven months, but was excommunicated. He was also initially victorious against Gil de Albornoz, the skillful Cardinal sent by Pope Innocent VI to conquer back the usurped territories of the Papal States, but in 1354 he was decisively defeated near Orvieto. After a short resistance in Viterbo, he surrendered and swore loyalty to Albornoz and the Church. In March 1355 he accompanied Charles IV of Bohemia to Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor. Taking advantage of Charles' protection, he tried to spur new rebellions in the Papal territories, but was always countered by Albornoz. He continued to rage sporadically in Tuscany, Lazio and Umbria, and died in April 1366, excommunicated by the Church.

It was signed by intellectuals and artists on June 17, 1968, in the midst of the Prague Spring, a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia that began in January 1968 with the election of Alexander Dubček and ended with the Soviet invasion in August, followed by the Czechoslovak Normalization.  Content  In essence, the \\"Two Thousand Words\\" was a call for the people of Czechoslovakia to hold their party accountable to standards of openness—not open revolution. Vaculik began with an assessment of how the nation had declined under the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), painting a picture of moral and economic decay in which workers made no decisions for themselves. > \\"Most people, therefore, lost interest in public affairs; they worried only > about themselves and about their money. Moreover, as a result of these bad > conditions, now one cannot even rely on money. Relationships between people > were harmed, and they didn’t enjoy working anymore. To sum up, the country > reached a point where its spiritual health and character were both ruined.\\" He gave credit to those \\"democratically-minded\\" members of the KSČ who had agitated for change in a stagnant era, saying that it had been possible to air antagonistic ideas only from inside the party structure. These ideas, he says, do not gain their power from being new, but rather weak party leaders and widespread inequality and poverty, which allowed a larger slice of society to realize their position. Rather than overturning the party, Vaculik prescribed that reformers support its progressive wing, which possessed \\"well-constructed organizations ... experienced officials ... [and] the decisive levers and buttons.\\" In a time of change, he said, the people should demand transparency in economic management and elect \\"capable and honest people\\" to be their representatives, as well as use legal and peaceful protests to bring down corrupt officials. He recognized the importance of a free press, and called for newspapers in the thrall of the party to be turned back into a \\"platform for all the positive forces.\\" The statement would later be condemned by the Soviets for challenging the leading role of the Soviet Union. Vaculik mentions the USSR only obliquely, referring to \\"foreign forces\\", and advising a gradual and moderate progression towards parity: \\"We can ensure equal relations only by improving our internal situation and by carrying forward the process of revival so far that one day at elections we will be able to elect statesmen who will have enough courage, honor, and political talent to establish and maintain such relations.\\" Overall, Vaculik called for the reinvention of socialism from within, through rigorous oversight by a newly empowered and unified population.  Backlash  Although the document did energize and inspire progressives at the lower levels of the party, it also had a tremendously polarizing effect, serving as the pretext for a conservative riposte that would get Vaculik banned from the party. The presidium went into immediate emergency session, which only served to increase the statement’s support at home. Government leaders quickly denounced the statement, and even Dubcek addressed the nation on television a few days after its publication calling for national unity. Two weeks later, I. Aleksandrov condemned the \\"Two Thousand Words\\" in the Moscow journal Pravda as \\"a sort of platform representing the forces in Czechoslovakia and abroad that are endeavoring, under the guise of talk about 'liberalization,' 'democratization,' etc., to strike out the entire history of Czechoslovakia since 1948 and the socialist achievements of the Czechoslovak working people, to discredit the Czechoslovak Communist Party and its leading role, to undermine the friendship between the Czechoslovak people and the peoples of fraternal socialist states and to pave the way for counterrevolution.\\"\\"Attack on the Socialist Foundations of Czechoslovakia.\\" Pravda, July 11, 1968, quoted from CDSP, Vol. XX, No. 25 (July 31, 1968) pp. 3-7. The statement did not significantly instigate local action, and weakened Czech diplomats like the moderate Josef Smrkovský in his efforts to placate the Soviets, who were disturbed by the pace of reform in Czechoslovakia. Ultimately, it was one of the building blocks that led to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in mid-August.Crampton p. 335  References   External links  * The Two Thousand Words, English translation at Prague Writers' Festival * The Two Thousand Words, English translation, Google Books * \\"The Two Thousand Words\\" Manifesto, signed by Intellectuals and Artists, June 17, 1968, excerpts * The Two Thousand Words (Dva tisíce slov), Czech original text, Czech Wikisource Category:Prague Spring Category:1968 documents ","title":"The Two Thousand Words"},{"id":"10990572","text":"The Colored American was an African-American newspaper published in New York City from 1837 to 1842 by Samuel Cornish, Phillip Alexander Bell, and Charles Bennett Ray.

It circulated in free black communities in the Northeastern United States. The Colored American focused on the moral, social, and political elevation of free colored people and the peaceful emancipation of slaves. The Reverend Lewis Woodson of Pittsburgh wrote a series of ten letters that were printed in the newspaper.

After the death of abolitionist David Walker, not knowing the cause of his seemingly sudden death, several black intellectuals wrote under pen names. Historian Floyd Miller attributed the title of the 'Father of Black Nationalism' to Woodson, mostly in recognition of the efficacy of the 'Augustine letters',Floyd Miller, \\"The Father of Black Nationalism,\\" Civil War History, vol 17, no. 4, Dec. 1971 Woodson argued in favor of an ideology that differed from that of another black abolitionist, William Whipper. Whipper ardently favored the improvement of the conditions among black Americans, but did not favor the establishment of separate black institutions, that is black self-determination. Whipper's letters also appeared in The Colored American. The newspaper had widespread subscribers; it engaged agents in various cities for marketing and distribution. The paper also received help from African-American churches and local abolition societies by way of fund drives and donations. Occasionally the newspaper received cash infusions from prominent white allies. All of the donations, fund drives and supplements helped the paper to publish 38 articles and survive through 1841.

College career After redshirting his first year in college, Abbate immediately became a starter in 2004. During that redshirt freshman season, Abbate had 101 tackles, including 13 tackles for a loss.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wake/sports/m-footbl/archive- pdf/cumulative-stats03.pdf In 2005, Abbate only had 76 tackles because of injury problems.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wake/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/05stats.pdf During the 2006 season, Abbate led the team in tackles with 120 (second in the ACC). He had a late interception in the endzone against rival University of North Carolina. In the ACC Championship in Jacksonville, Florida, Abbate had 15 tackles against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. The Deacons won that game 9-6. Abbate was voted as the MVP of the game for ABC. Abbate then played in the Orange Bowl against the University of Louisville. He had 15 tackles in that game, the first Bowl Championship Series bowl game participation for Wake Forest. Abbate was named an All-American (honorable mention, Sports Illustrated) and first team All-ACC (ACSMA, College Football News) in recognition of his performance throughout his final season during which he averaged 8.6 tackles per game. The 2006 season On February 13, 2006, Abbate's 15-year-old brother, Luke, was seriously injured in a car accident on the way home from lacrosse practice, and died two days later. Before his junior season, Abbate asked head coach Jim Grobe whether he could switch his jersey number from 40 to 5, the number his brother had worn. Grobe agreed, and Abbate wore the number throughout his junior season. During the 2006 season, Abbate and his family would hold up five fingers before the start of the fourth quarter as a tribute to Luke. As the season progressed, Abbate's teammates, Wake Forest fans, and even fans of opposing teams began holding up five fingers as well—a tradition that attracted much media attention during the Deacons' successful year. Additionally, the Abbate family created the \\"Five Foundation\\" to raise awareness among young people of the responsibilities and dangers of driving.::Five Foundation:: Luke Abbate Foundation  Jon Abbate A movie about Jon Abbate, his brother Luke, and Wake Forest's 2006 football season, entitled The 5th Quarter, was released on March 25, 2011.

Named sections Several stretches of I-20 are named for various people and reasons: * From the Alabama state line to I-285 on the west side of Atlanta, I-20 is named the Tom Murphy Freeway, after the former speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. * Between both the west and east sides of I-285, I-20 was named the Ralph David Abernathy Freeway in 1991 after the late civil rights activist. * From I-285 in Dekalb County to US 129/US 441/SR 24 in the southern part of Madison, I-20 is named the Purple Heart Highway for military veterans who either died or were injured in combat while in service on or after April 15, 1917. * Between US 129/US 441/SR 24 and the South Carolina state line, I-20 is named the Carl Sanders Highway after the former Georgia governor who was born in Augusta. History I-20 eastbound at the I-520 interchange. Flyover ramp under construction for I-20 westbound to I-520 eastbound I-20's path through Atlanta was designed in the late 1950s, during the era of segregation, to separate the city's white and African-American populations. The first segment opened between 1960 and 1963 from downtown Atlanta to Conyers. It was under construction from just south of Douglasville to downtown Atlanta, from Conyers to a point south of Social Circle, and from Evans to Augusta. By 1966, the highway was proposed from the Alabama state line to SR 5 in Douglasville, was open from Douglasville to the western part of Atlanta, under construction in the western part of Atlanta, was open from downtown Atlanta to US 278/SR 12 near Social Circle, was under construction from that point to SR 83 in Madison; proposed from Madison to the Warren–McDuffie county line, under construction from there to the South Carolina state line. Later that year, was open from Douglasville to the Social Circle area and from SR 383 on the Evans–Martinez city line to the South Carolina state line. In 1967, it was under construction from the Social Circle area to Siloam. It was open from US 221/SR 47 south of Appling to the South Carolina state line. In 1968, it was open from Douglasville to Madison and from just north of Thomson to the South Carolina state line. In 1969, the highway was open from Douglasville to US 129/US 441/SR 24 in Madison. In 1970, it was under construction from Madison to the Thomson area. In 1971, was open from Douglasville to SR 44 in Greensboro. In 1972, the highway was open from Douglasville to the South Carolina state line. In 1973, it was under construction from US 27/SR 1 in Bremen to Douglasville. In 1974, it was under construction from the Alabama state line to Douglasville. In 1975, it was open from Villa Rica to Douglasville. The last part of Interstate 20 opened in 1977 between the Alabama state line and Villa Rica. Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway would begin with the number \\"1\\" and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, the Georgia Department of Transportation switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost. From a period of late 2014 to mid-2015, I-20 was widened from the Alabama state line eastward to Villa Rica, GA. Most of that length had the roadway widened from four to six lanes, with ultimate plans to widen to at least six lanes from Birmingham, Alabama to Atlanta. Phase 1, which detailed resurfacing the roadway for future expansion preparation, has been completed as of January 2017. Phase 2 is being prepared to add the additional lanes. On April 17, 2017, an abandoned gas pipeline exploded under Interstate 20. Exit list Auxiliary routes Interstate 520 Interstate 520 (I-520) is a auxiliary route from Augusta, Georgia to North Augusta, South Carolina. Approximately of the highway is in Georgia. It is also known as the Bobby Jones Expressway in Georgia and the Palmetto Parkway in South Carolina. The Georgia part of the highway has an unsigned designation of State Route 415 (SR 415). Despite its odd first number, both of its endpoints are at I-20 (albeit in two different states), as it loops around the Augusta/North Augusta area to the south. Interstate 420 Interstate 420 (I-420) was an auxiliary Interstate Highway that was planned to bypass south of Atlanta. It is now known as Arthur B. Langford Jr. Parkway. If built, it would have had the unsigned designation State Route 414 (SR 414). It was not built because of opposition from communities in its path.

The subjects of the Sultans Jasin and Refle were forced to accept Italian rule, otherwise they would not be permitted to draw water at Werder. The eastern part of Ogaden was administered by Ethiopian officials for the first time on 23 September 1948 when Ethiopian administrators were sent to Kebri Dahar, Kelafo and Werder. Although Werder remained in Somali hands at the end of the Ogaden War, Ethiopian units under Brigadier-General Demisse Bulto, commander of the First Revolutionary Army, recovered Werder as part of Operation Lash by November 1980, and used the town as one of its three bases to successfully clear the rest of eastern Ethiopia of foreign Somali troops by 3 December.Gebru Tareke, \\"From Lash to Red Star: The Pitfalls of Counter-Insurgency in Ethiopia, 1980-82\\", Journal of Modern African Studies, 40 (2002), p. 471 Government security forces and members of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) clashed in Werder on 23 February 1994.

The term may also be used as a name for a series of pictures or sculptures representing the various episodes, although these are nowhere near as common as those for the Stations of the Cross, depicting the stages of the Passion of Jesus. The concept was devised in 1988. The Stations of the Resurrection complement the Stations of the Cross or Via Crucis (the term Via Lucis is intentionally reminiscent of this), a traditional Catholic devotion commemorating the Passion of Jesus. Unlike the traditional form of the Stations of the Cross—though in common with the revised form of that devotion introduced by Pope John Paul II on Good Friday 1991—all the Stations of the Resurrection are based on scripturally-recorded incidents contained in the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. As with the Stations of the Cross, the devotion takes no fixed form, but typically includes for each Station a reading from Scripture, a short meditation, and a prayer. Where a series of pictures is used to aid the devotion, it takes the form of a procession, with movement from one Station to the next sometimes being accompanied by the singing of one or more verses of a hymn. History In the traditional scheme of the Stations of the Cross, the final Station is the burial of Jesus. Though this constitutes a logical conclusion to the Via Crucis, it has been increasingly regarded as unsatisfactory as an end-point to meditation upon the Paschal mystery, which according to Christian doctrine culminates in, and is incomplete without, the Resurrection (see, for example, 1 Corinthians 15.17–20). For this reason a fifteenth Station, representing the Resurrection, is sometimes added to the Stations of the Cross. Even this practice has, however, been subject to criticism as insufficiently representing the two-fold dynamic of the Paschal mystery: the suffering and death of Jesus on the one hand, and on the other his Resurrection and glorification. In the summer of 1988, Father Sabino Palumbieri, Professor of Anthropology at the Salesian University in Rome, proposed the creation of a new set of stations, centred upon the Resurrection and the events following from it, so as to emphasise the positive, hopeful aspect of the Christian story which, though not absent from the Stations of the Cross, is obscured by their emphasis upon suffering. The first major public celebration of this devotion was in 1990, after which it gained greater currency. In December 2001, the Holy See promulgated a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, which commended the Via Lucis as follows: > A pious exercise called the Via Lucis has developed and spread to many > regions in recent years. Following the model of the Via Crucis, the faithful > process while meditating on the various appearances of Jesus – from his > Resurrection to his Ascension – in which he showed his glory to the > disciples who awaited the coming of the Holy Spirit (cf. John 14, 26; 16, > 13-15; Lk 24, 49), strengthened their faith, brought to completion his > teaching on the Kingdom and more closely defined the sacramental and > hierarchical structure of the Church. > > Through the Via Lucis, the faithful recall the central event of the faith – > the resurrection of Christ – and their discipleship in virtue of Baptism, > the paschal sacrament by which they have passed from the darkness of sin to > the bright radiance of the light of grace (cf. Col 1, 13; Eph 5, 8). > > For centuries the Via Crucis involved the faithful in the first moment of > the Easter event, namely the Passion, and helped to fix its most important > aspects in their consciousness. Analogously, the Via Lucis, when celebrated > in fidelity to the Gospel text, can effectively convey a living > understanding to the faithful of the second moment of the Paschal event, > namely the Lord's Resurrection. > > The Via Lucis is potentially an excellent pedagogy of the faith, since \\"per > crucem ad lucem\\" [through the Cross (one comes) to the light]. Using the > metaphor of a journey, the Via Lucis moves from the experience of suffering, > which in God's plan is part of life, to the hope of arriving at man's true > end: liberation, joy and peace which are essentially paschal values. > > The Via Lucis is a potential stimulus for the restoration of a \\"culture of > life\\" which is open to the hope and certitude offered by faith, in a society > often characterized by a \\"culture of death\\", despair and nihilism. List of Stations there is no universally-agreed list of Stations of the Resurrection, nor have any Church authorities sought to impose a definitive list, and as a result some churches have commissioned sets of sculptures for the Stations according to their own distinctive scheme which may not be followed elsewhere. (This is similar to the history of the Stations of the Cross, which attained their normative form only after many centuries of widely varying local practice.) As to the number of Stations, however, there is general agreement that in order to emphasise the complementarity between the Stations of the Cross and the Stations of the Resurrection there should be fourteen Stations of the Resurrection, as is traditionally the case with the Stations of the Cross. In spite of continuing local variability, there appears nevertheless to be an increasing convergence upon the following as a recognised list of Stations of the Resurrection: #Jesus is raised from the dead #The finding of the empty tomb #Mary Magdalene meets the risen Jesus #Jesus appears on the road to Emmaus #Jesus is known in the breaking of bread #Jesus appears to the disciples in Jerusalem #Jesus gives the disciples his peace and the power to forgive sins #Jesus strengthens the faith of Thomas #Jesus appears by the Sea of Tiberias #Jesus forgives Peter and commands him to feed his sheep #Jesus commissions the disciples upon the mountain #The Ascension of Jesus #Mary and the disciples wait in prayer #The Holy Spirit descends at Pentecost Other sources, however, including some recent ones, replace some of these Stations with others, such as: *The earthquake *The angel appears to the women *Jesus meets the women *Mary Magdalene proclaims the Resurrection to the disciples *Jesus and the beloved disciple *Jesus appears to over five hundred at once *Jesus appears to Saul References *Stations of the Resurrection, Raymond Chapman, Canterbury Press, 1998, 0853112119 *Common Worship: Times and Seasons, Church House Publishing, 2006, 071512112X Stations of the Light: Renewing the Ancient Christian Practice of the Via Lucis as a Scriptural Tool for Today, Mary Ford-Grabowsky, Image Book, Doubleday, 2005, 0385511655 Category:Easter liturgy Category:Cross symbols Category:Catholic art by subject Category:Christian iconography Category:Catholic devotions ","title":"Stations of the Resurrection"},{"id":"10990809","text":"Maxi-Man is the name of two DC Comics heroes. The first was created by Len Wein and Joe Phillips and first appeared in Mister Miracle (vol. 2) #9 (October 1989). The second was created by Jodi Picoult and Drew Johnson and first appeared in Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #6 (May 2007). Fictional character biography Henry Hayes Henry Hayes worked in a successful ad agency. After he was fired, his wife took his young son and left him. Hayes drifted through life until the detonation of an alien gene bomb. He was rushed to the hospital and accidentally given a lethal dose of adrenaline. Instead of dying, Hayes was granted superstrength, superspeed, and superhuman endurance. He decided to become the super-hero Maxi-Man. Maxi-Man was initially unsuccessful due to the fact he was outshined by the other heroes and decided to move to a small town. Unfortunately for Maxi-Man, he chose Bailey, New Jersey, the new home of Mister Miracle II. During the first disaster, Miracle was able to save the day before Maxi-Man could act. Deciding Mister Miracle had to go, Maxi-Man tried to defeat him during their next encounter. Mister Miracle avoided fighting Maxi-Man and made him look foolish. Maxi-Man became more enraged until the crowd intervened. Learning a valuable lesson about heroism, Maxi-Man moved on to work on his skills. Hayes didn't stay out of the limelight for long. He soon joined Booster Gold's corporate hero team, The Conglomerate. In addition to fighting crime, Maxi-Man and his teammates also became corporate sponsors. Hayes personally appeared in advertisements for Danielle Foods, a lawn care company and division of LexCorp. He participated in the coup of San Sebor. Though the ruler was a tyrant, some of Hayes' teammates protested the nature of the mission. The Justice League attempted to arrest the team after this, but they decided to talk instead and left on uncomfortable terms. Maxi-Man and his team were endangered when one of their liaisons, Thrunctuous, illegally worked with Hector Hammond to create a new superhero that would 'accidentally' kill the Conglomerate. Thrunctuous and the superhero, a mindless monster, both died in the resulting fight. The group survived the bad publicity as it was spun that they worked with the JLI to 'save' the world'. The group soon decided not to follow along with their sponsors' often illegal ideas and became a branch of the League. Maxi-Man left the team afterwards. Maxi-Man was often considered old-fashioned by his friends. His speech patterns were decades out of date. Instead of pondering the social implications of removing the leader of San Sebor, he declared his love for patriotic superheroes, including General Glory. He later stated his favorite film is Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, a Frank Capra movie. Death However, Maxi-Man did not retire and continued adventuring until he was captured by Roulette and forced to battle in her House. Apparently, he was killed, and his picture was hung among the other fallen players. Maxi-Man successor Maxi-Man from Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #6 (May 2007) A new Maxi-Man recently appeared on the super-hero stage. This second Maxi-Man became a hero after winning a reality tv show and possesses identical powers as the original. He makes a publicity appearance at a theme park, guarded by government agents Nemesis and Diana Prince AKA Wonder Woman. Debris from a faulty coaster knocks out Maxi-Man. Nemesis saves him while Wonder Woman saves the coaster.

Plunderathon is run by a group calling itself \\"the Infernal Order of Pirates, Buccaneers, Scallywags, and PrivateersPirates in Portland - nyquil.org\\" that prides itself on a heavy disinformation campaign leading up to the event, often issuing press statements that flatly contradict previous ones and making \\"historical\\" claims of Plunderathons from over a century ago. Throughout the event, the designated historian will often be called upon to recite the history of the Order in exchange for rum, which he or she does by making it up on the spot and claiming authenticity. Plunderathon is not tied to any venue or location, but is a mobile combination of a parade, bar crawl and public art spectacle very similar to the CacophonySociety's SantaCon. Participants dress up as pirates, make \\"ships\\" out of shopping carts and parade through town for around 10 hours, mostly in the Old Town/Chinatown, Downtown and Vaseline Alley areas. Costumes range from cheap party store items to high-quality theatrical costumes. The 2006 Plunderathon had over 120 piratesFlickr : Photos comportant le tag plunderathon and featured a treasure chest-shaped piñata that was full of condoms and a beanbag fight (called \\"cannonball fight\\") in the North Park Blocks. They also visited the Shanghai tunnels, walked completely through Powell's Books, the Pearl District, pushed the ship/cart through the US Bancorp TowerPlunderathon! Acting horribly in public since 1843 and blocked traffic on several downtown streets while moving from one place to another in long single-file lines. The new Plunderathon logo, released on their website in January 2008, states the elements of the logo are: A skull with mugs tilted away from the center, handles upward, in the place of eyesockets. Rum bottles tilted together take the place of nasal passages, crossed unadorned bones lie behind the skull. In a circle around the skull and crossed bones, from the lower left end of the cross to the lower right, is the text \\"the Infernal Order of Pirates, Buccaneers, Scallywags, Privateers and Grocery Store Clerks.\\" Under the cross is the text \\"Est. 1843\\" for the year of the first Plunderathon. As long as these elements exist and nothing is added to it, the logo is used to identify those who have participated in Plunderathon. Pirates who have split from Plunderathon and gone out on their own omit the text \\"the Infernal Order of Pirates, Buccaneers, Scallywags, Privateers and Grocery Store Clerks\\" but retain \\"Est. 1843\\" out of respect for their roots. The 2007 Plunderathon was a record-setting 250 Pirates in size overall (though at any one point numbers topped out at 180) and featured a compressed-air cannon that shot sex toys, chocolate coin and small toys at passers by, as well as a large rubber band war and an invasion of the Pride Festival. The Portland pirate rock band Sunken Chest played a rock'n set at the Ash Street Saloon. The flagship for 2007 was the H.M.S. Venture (named after the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture Bros., which replaced the 2006 flagship, the H.M.S. Birdman). The Venture was the first flagship to survive a Plunderathon intact. Another ship, the Flaming Molly, was shanghaied before the end of the event and its wreckage was found in Old Town a week later, next to a chocolate shop. Plunderathon has been featured in The Oregonian's Culturepulp comic \\"CulturePulp\\" by Mike Russell as well as local newspapers such as The Portland Mercury,Portland Mercury The Daily Oregonian,http://home.comcast.net/~vidarica/tropicaltimes- july2006.pdf and the Willamette Week.

Smith, 472 U.S. 479 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the right to petition does not provide absolute immunity to petitioners; it is subject to the same restrictions as other First Amendment rights.  Background  In 1981, David Smith brought a libel suit against Robert McDonald claiming that Mcdonald had included knowing and malicious lies in a letter to the President concerning Smith's possible appointment as a United States attorney. Smith claimed that these libelous claims damaged both his chances of appointment and his reputation and career. McDonald first had the case removed to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Since the alleged libel was contained in a letter (petition) to the President, he moved for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the Petition Clause of the First Amendment protected his right to express his views without limitation as long as it was part of a constitutionally protected petition.  Opinion of the Court  The issue before the Court was whether the right to petition the government granted absolute immunity from liability. The Court decided 8–0 (Justice Powell took no part in the case) that the right to petition was subject to the same legal limitations that the rights to speech and the press are as previously decided in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Therefore, claims made in the original letter, or in any similar petition, were and are subject to libel lawsuits to be judged on their merits. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other members joined. Justice Brennan wrote a concurrence, joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun.

It is an affiliate of the Sutter Health Network and Alta Bates Summit Medical Center. It is the only provider of physical therapists, occupational therapists, and physician assistants and is the largest source of nurses in the greater East Bay.For the 2007/2008 academic year, 355 Samuel Merritt nursing graduates took the NCLEX exam compared with CSU East Bay - 83, Merritt College - 43, Chabot College - 34, Ohlone College - 50, Contra Costa College - 81, Los Medanos College - 46, and Unitek College - 36 Formerly known as Samuel Merritt College, it was founded in 1909 as a hospital school of nursing.  History  Samuel Merritt University was founded in 1909 through the legacy of Dr. Samuel Merritt. Drawn by the excitement of California in the 1850s, Merritt left his Maine home to seek his fortune in the west. He settled in Oakland, and as a dedicated physician, architect, ship builder, and civic planner his influence was etched on the history of the city. Merritt left plans for a hospital to be built in his name after his death. His dream was realized in 1909 when Samuel Merritt College and Samuel Merritt Hospital opened their doors. In recent years, Samuel Merritt has increased its enrollment from 146 to over 1,000 graduate and undergraduate students and added new programs in the health sciences. Samuel Merritt's students represent all ages, ethnicities, and geographical locations. The Intercollegiate Nursing Program with Saint Mary's was established in 1981. Samuel Merritt College established the entry-level Master of Physical Therapy in 1990, the Master of Occupational Therapy in 1992. The College also offers a Master of Science in Nursing three advanced nursing specialties: Case Management, Family nurse practitioner (FNP), and Nurse Anesthesia (CRNA). In 2005, the department of Physical Therapy graduated its first Doctor of Physical Therapy class. With initiation of the Master Physician Assistant program in 1999, the first entry-level graduate program for physician assistants in California, and the establishment of the California School of Podiatric Medicine in 2002, Samuel Merritt University has fostered a growing reputation for undergraduate and graduate education in the health sciences. Samuel Merritt University is listed as \\"unranked\\" by U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges Ranking.Samuel Merritt University Rankings Academics  Programs  SMU is a university dedicated to health sciences. Most of the university's programs are at the graduate level; however, the School of Nursing offers two bachelor's degree programs. Podiatric medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nursing practice are all offered at the doctoral level while the physician assistant program is offered at the master's level. The university's average graduation rate is 95 percent and student scores on licensure pass rates are 90 percent or above for first-time test takers in six programs.

Common names include European physa, tadpole snail, bladder snail, and acute bladder snail. In addition, Physa acuta, Physa heterostropha (Say, 1817) and Physa integra (Haldeman, 1841) are synonyms of Physella acuta (Draparnaud, 1805). Shell description Shell of Physella acuta Snails in the family Physidae have shells that are sinistral, which means that if the shell is held with the aperture facing the observer and the spire pointing up, then the aperture is on the left-hand side. The shells of Physella species have a long and large aperture, a pointed spire, and no operculum. The shells are thin and corneous and rather transparent. Distribution It was once thought that the indigenous distribution of Physella acuta is Mediterranean. Lisický M. J. (1991). Mollusca Slovenska [The Slovak molluscs].

However, when Physella heterostropha is considered to be a synonym, then the indigenous distribution of the species includes North America. Physella acuta is a common species which is common in all of North America and Europe.

Ecology Habitat This species lives in freshwater rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and swamps. Physella acuta is frequently found in anthropogenic reservoirs, occurring in warm water discharges from power stations and in some rivers, but very rarely and not numerously in clay pit ponds. It can survive well under temporary harsh conditions (extreme temperature and water pollution), as long as they are short-lived.  Feeding habits  These snails eat dead plant and animal matter and various other detritus. Because Physella acuta forages mainly on epiphytic vegetation and on the macrophytes, whereas other gastropods (Planorbis planorbis, Radix ovata) exploit the algal cover or phytobentos on the bottom, competition between Physella acuta and other gastropods appears to be minimal.  Interspecific relationship  This species successfully co- exists with other alien gastropods: for example with Potamopyrgus antipodarum in many streams, lakes and ponds in New Zealand and with Lithoglyphus naticoides in the Danube River.

Nevertheless, Richardson signed his plans \\"Winn Library,\\" and it remains known in architectural circles as \\"Winn Memorial Library.\\" The inscription in the entrance porch reads: \\"This building was erected in memory of Jonathan Bowers Winn from funds bequeathed by his son, for the use, benefit and improvement of the people of Woburn.\\" It was built between 1876 and 1879, and was the first in a series of libraries designed by Richardson (1838-1886). In it he established a characteristic, basilical plan for such buildings: an off-axis entrance marked by a staircase tower; a vestibule opening into a high- ceilinged reception area; reading room(s) adjacent to the stacks; and an optional art gallery. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 in recognition of its architectural significance. and The library's main (south) facade presents a long, two-story stack wing to the west (left), slit windows on the first story with a strip of clerestory windows separated by columns above, all below a peaked roof. The gable-ended crossing (center) features a trio of arched double windows on the first story, a line of seven arched single windows above, and an attached High Victorian tower. On the opposite side of the tower is the arch of the entrance porch. The easternmost section is an attached two-and-a-half-story octagonal wing that houses the museum. The building's polychromatic exterior is constructed of brownstone trimmed with lighter stone, sometimes laid in bands, and set in alternating colors over the main arches and the entrance porch. This is all beneath a red tile roof trimmed with bronze cresting, with crocketed ribs on the roofs of the tower and museum. The interior features a reception room/picture gallery with the museum to the right and a trio of reading rooms to the left. Beyond the reading rooms are the 2-story stacks, that feature a tall 6-arch arcade on each side, topped by a wooden barrel-vaulted ceiling. There are curved staircases at the four corners of the stacks, in addition to the main stair in the tower. A statue of native son and notable scientist Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, stands on the main lawn before the library. File:Winn Memorial Library - Woburn, MA - DSC02863.JPGGable and tower.

She was also a journalist for the newspaper The Globe and Mail, and won a National Newspaper Award in 1992 for critical writing.  Biography  Val Ross was born in Toronto in 1950, to Jack and Erma Ross, and had one younger brother, Philip (\\"Pip\\"). Val attended the Institute of Child Study, a progressive primary school operated by the University of Toronto. After completing high school at Jarvis Collegiate Institute, she considered becoming a visual artist and studied at St Martin's School of Art in London, England. Eventually she graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto. Before establishing her career as a freelance writer, she worked in urban planning, tourism writing and as a broadcaster at CBC. She traveled extensively, developing her interests in community, culture and media. In the early 1970s she began studying Washin Ryu, a form of karate taught by Sensei Burt Konzak, attaining a brown belt. Val was also highly involved with several groups of women in the Toronto area that met frequently for recreational walks (The \\"Walking Women\\"). She wrote for Chatelaine, Saturday Night, and Toronto Life, and then was hired as a staff writer and editor at Maclean's, where she worked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She reported on the conflict in El Salvador, and became an important voice for human rights and freedom of expression. She spent the remainder of her career at The Globe and Mail, as a publishing reporter, as deputy editor of the Comment section, and as an arts reporter. She wrote two children's books, 2003's The Road to There and 2006's You Can't Read This. The former, a history of cartography, won the $10,000 Norma Fleck Award in 2004. You Can't Read This is a history of banned literature. Her final book, the posthumous Robertson Davies: A Portrait in Mosaic, is an oral history of Canadian writer Robertson Davies.

These snails eat algae, diatoms and detritus.  Anatomy  Members of the freshwater pulmonate family Physidae possess a complex of muscles that is unique amongst gastropods. This complex was given the name \\"physid musculature\\". The physid musculature has two main components, the physid muscle sensu stricto and the fan muscle. The physid musculature is responsible for a unique ability of physids to rapidly flick their shells from side to side — a reaction that frequently enables them to escape predation.

The monolithic, plinth-based construction prevented structural cracking however, and, after many anxious years, the building settled back to near vertical (180 degrees). Inside the mausoleum are displayed the original bronze outer doors, featuring bas-relief work.

Early life  Ulises Francisco Espaillat Quiñones was born on 9 February 1823 in Santiago, officially known from 1822 to 1844 as Saint-Yague, into a wealthy family of French, Canarian, Aragonese and Genovese descent; he was the only son of Pedro Ramón Espaillat Velilla (Santiago, 1796−idem, 1882) and María Petronila Quiñones Tavares (1804−1874). His father was the tenth and junior child of Francisco Antonio Espaillat Virol —a Frenchman native to Masclat that settled in Santiago in 1758 in an epoch where one-third of the population was of French origin— and Petronila Velilla Sánchez —whose father was born in Aragon. He was described by his contemporaries as a tall, pale-complexioned, blue-eyed, dark blond-haired man. In his early childhood and adolescence he received lessons in English, French, music, mathematics and other disciplines, within the limited possibilities of school education that the country lived under the Haitian occupation. He later received medical lessons from a paternal uncle, Dr. Santiago Espaillat (who later became President-elect in 1849). Ulises Espaillat established a pharmacy in the early 1840s. In 1845, he married his first cousin Eloísa Espaillat Rodríguez, daughter of his uncle Juan José Espaillat Velilla.

Espaillat was a political and economic liberal who wished to broaden the personal freedoms of the Dominican people and improve the country's economy by taking from the producers of the society in order to pay for his ideas. However, he was forced to resign (on December 20, 1876) before he could set in motion any plan of action, due to rebellions in the south and east.Dominican Republic - The Contest for Power, 1865-82 Legacy Espaillat Province, as well as a metro station in Santo Domingo are named after him. Ancestry  Offspring  President Espaillat has been identified as the most recent common ancestor for most of the Dominican oligarchy and aristocracy, since his offspring managed to establish bonds with the most prominent families from Santiago, who became later the richest families of the country. *Ulises Francisco Espaillat Velilla link=Christian marriage his cousin Eloísa Espaillat Rodríguez (Santiago, 1818–ibid., 1919) ** Teófilo Espaillat Espaillat (Santiago, 1847–1866);

It was originally depicted as a curved sword (see the Zliten mosaic as well as numerous oil lamps) and many examples have been found in what are today Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania. It is also depicted on Trajan's Column; notably the Dacian king Decebalus is depicted committing suicide with one. Etymology Possibly from Proto-Albanian *tsikā (whence Albanian thikë, \\"knife\\"), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱey- (\\"to sharpen\\") possibly via Illyrian. According to Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et RomainesDictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines, tome 4, volume 2 (R–S), Paris, 1926, p. 1300, s.v. sica the name Sica comes from Proto-Indo-European root sek-, meaning \\"to cut\\", \\"to section\\", however De Vaan declares any connection to Proto-Indo-European *sek- to be formally impossible. Types From a typological point of view, though there is a strong tendency towards standardization, the sica daggers can be organised in three main types that differ only by morphological aspects, not functional. Scabbard for a sica from the Dacian warrior tomb of Cugir, dated 1st century BC. Fragments of the helmet and other inventory pieces are also seen on the right side. In display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia, Romania The first type is characterized by its solidity, sometimes with a broken figure immediately after the blade's middle part, with a short and sharp point, with a slight curvature, a short handle cane, usually of a triangular shape, that has a hole for the fixing rivet, close to the blade. The blade has incised ornaments and a fuller deeply carved into it. These characteristics are not general, the only standing arguments for this type being the size and the shape approximately similar. The second type, not very different morphologically speaking, does not have the solid shape of the first type, but a longer blade, with a fuller, and keeps, most often, the haft's tongue short and of a triangular shape. The third type, more numerous, gathers a series of daggers characterized by a long blade, elegantly manufactured in most cases, by the ornamentation with incised circles and/or lines along the blade, the presence of the fuller, the haft's tongue as long as the haft and a guard muff. These distinctive elements are found either all together, or some of the pieces present one or more of these characteristic features. The sizes show a relative standardization, somewhere around 30–40 cm length and approximately 3 cm width. From a chronological point of view, this type of dagger is dated mostly in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Significance Suicide of Decebalus, from Trajan's Column The distinctive shape was designed to get around the sides of an opponent's shield, and stab or slash them in the back. Since the thraex gladiator's usual opponent was the scutum (large shield) carrying murmillo gladiator, such a weapon as the sica was necessary to make the duel more even and exciting. The daggers’ decoration, remarkably complex, offers them a sum of spiritual, artistically and symbolical valences. On the blade geometrical shapes were incised, but also eagles and snakes, in which case their schematization requires the existence of a certain \\"code\\", or they were an emblem that underlined the membership of a certain brotherhood at arms or a certain social status, as well possible to have a mystical/magical component included. From the facts presented above, it can be stated that the sica dagger represents an important historical artifact which, due to its importance and the role it played in the Thracian world, contributes to the understanding of the social and military mechanisms of this society and, through the special spiritual dimension, to the reception of a new side from the religious mosaic of this people. From all the curved weapons used in the Thracian area, the sica daggers are the only ones that make the connection between the Southern Thracians and the Thracians North to the Danube, being spread the same on both sides of the river.  Illyrian  The Romans regarded the sica as a distinctive Illyrian weapon. The principal melee weapon of the Illyrians was the Sica.The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, page 238, \\"Their principal offensive weapon was the single edged curved- sword, similar to the Greek machaira, a form of weapon that can be traced back to Bronze age times...\\" According to historian John Wilkes:The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, pages 238–239, \\"Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius)...\\" > Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the > Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon > used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius) See also * Sicarii, either of two Jewish extremist groups * Dacian warfare * Falx * Gladiator * Gladius * Illyrian warfare * Ludus Dacicus * Pugio * Spatha * Thracian warfare References External links * https://www.scribd.com/document/33875732/Borangic-C-Sica-Tipologie-Si- Functional-It-Ate-NEMVS-IV-7-8-2009 * www.enciclopedia-dacica.ro http://enciclopedia- dacica.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=709&Itemid;=377 * Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines, tom 4, vol. 2 (R–S), Paris, 1926, p. 1300, s.v. sica Category:Ancient weapons Category:Blade weapons Category:Thracian culture Category:Dacia Category:Dacian weapons Category:Illyrian warfare Category:Roman swords ","title":"Sica"},{"id":"10991051","text":"Daniel Dickinson Stevens (December 19, 1839Sources are inconsistent on Stevens' date and place of birth.

Wolf got his start writing songs for his band and various artists before working for Warner/Chappell Music as staff songwriter. Soon after, he wrote and produced music for several feature films. He wrote the theme song for the Rodney Dangerfield film, Back To School and began contribute to many large film projects, most notably producing for Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes for the number one box office Karate Kid II and penning a song for the Madonna vehicle, Who's That Girl. In 1989 he teamed up with Brett \\"Epic\\" Mazur to form the production team Wolf & Epic. Wolf & Epic were among the first record makers to break down the barriers between R&B;, Hip-hop & Pop at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time, Wolf worked on projects for artists such as MC Lyte, Prince, Seal, New Kids on the Block, Nona Gaye, Coolio, New Edition, Sheena Easton, Laquan and Bell Biv Devoe. Bell Biv Devoe's début album Poison and remix album WBBD-Bootcity both featured Wolf's production, and were certified triple Platinum and Gold respectively. Acid Jazz was another new fusion of musical styles which Wolf & Epic helped pioneer with their work on the first Acid Jazz compilation The Rebirth of the Cool Vol.1 (Island Records). In the twenty-first century Wolf's focus turned back to producing and composing for visual media. His score for the Warner Bros. cartoon Static Shock shook up Saturday morning programming with its fusion of hip-hop, electronic and traditional score, for which it was recognized with two Daytime Emmy nominations in 2003 and 2004 and one win. His work has appeared in hundreds of television episodes and films including Big Bang Theory, Nashville, Oprah, Criminal Minds, America's Next Top Model, Bojack Horseman, CBS Sports, NASCAR, and twelve seasons of the worldwide hit, NCIS. Wolf is currently on the faculty of the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music where he teaches classes on music in media and culture, and the special relationship between musical practice and mindfulness practice. His book \\"In Tune: Music As The Bridge To Mindfuless\\" charts twelve “bridges”—skills and sensibilities refined in musical practice that carry over to mindfulness and meditation. The New Yorker refers to this book as \\"a manual for achieving calm in a tumultuous world\\". Wolf also works with a diversity of charities and is a board member of the I Have A Dream Foundation. Musician Wolf, a Manhattan native, signed his first record deal, with Quinn Ivy Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, while still a freshman in college. It was at those sessions that he met Muscle Shoals guitar player Wayne Perkins, with whom he later co-wrote songs for the funky Southern rock band Crimson Tide. The group released two albums for Capitol Records in 1978 and 1979, which enjoyed limited success. Wolf then signed as a staff songwriter with Warner/Chappell Music. While there, he worked on various film and television projects, and artists including Steve Cropper, Angela Bofill, Johnny Gill and Toni Basil covered his songs. Record producer and songwriter In 1989 Wolf teamed up with his former studio intern Brett \\"Epic\\" Mazur to form what major west coast artist manager Jerry Heller (of N.W.A and Eazy-E) would describe as \\"the hottest producing team of the early 1990s:\\" Wolf & Epic (initially named Peace Productions). Wolf's vision was to record live the type of funk and R&B; that was commonly sampled by hip hop producers and then overlay scratching and other hip hop techniques to give it a new dimension. Wolf played guitar and keyboards, Mazur played drums and deejayed, and other musicians were brought in to fatten the sound. Mazur praised his older counterpart as having \\"the knack to come up with that undeniable hook. Even if it's just a keyboard part, he goes beyond just a chorus\\". The two musicians used the generation gap to their advantage and were able to span several genres and styles in their acclaimed productions. Wolf & Epic's first project together was with Laquan on his album Notes of a Native Son. This record was one of the first to combine a live band with hip hop scratching, sampling, and rapping. The New York Times praised Laquan, saying that listening to his music is \\"to hear the shape of urban debates to come\\" and admired the \\"slick pop choruses [that] buoy his songs\\". One of the tracks was included on the compilation The Rebirth of the Cool Vol. 1 (Island Records), which spawned a string of albums that pioneered the \\"Acid Jazz\\" movement of jazzy hip hop. The duo later wrote and recorded another acid jazz hit, \\"Eyes of the Soul,\\" on MC Lyte's Atlantic Records album Act Like You Know. In the early 1990s, Wolf & Epic, along with other producers, worked on Bell Biv Devoe's album, Poison: a triple-platinum album that pioneered the fusion of soul and hip hop. Wolf & Epic, who had a No. 1 hit with their remixed version of Bell Biv Devoe's \\"Do Me\\", went on to \\"use the finished record as raw material... [to] completely re-produce it\\". The result was WBBD-Bootcity!: The Remix Album, the chart topping, certified gold album of Bell Biv Devoe remixes that sealed Wolf & Epic's reputation as \\"the hot new kids on the remixing block\\". Some of Wolf's other notable projects during this time include work on Ralph Tresvant's \\"Public Figure,\\" Sheena Easton's \\"You Can Swing It\\", remixes of Prince's \\"Horny Pony\\" and Seal's \\"Crazy\\", and work with the New Kids on the Block and Nona Gaye. After Wolf and Mazur amicably parted ways, Wolf continued to write, produce, and remix records with artists including Freddie Mercury, Coolio, CeCe Peniston (\\"I Will Be Received\\"), MC Lyte, Ricky Bell, and Johnny Gill. Film music production and composition Most recently, a song that Wolf co-wrote was placed in the Robocop remake released in 2014. Wolf broke into the film industry when he co- wrote and produced several songs (including the title song) for Rodney Dangerfield's film, Back to School, in 1985. After that project, Wolf wrote and produced music for several more major film projects including The Karate Kid, Part II and Madonna's Who's That Girl. Wolf's work on Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase marked his entry into composing for animated stories. The film- makers wanted to move Scooby Doo into the new century, which Wolf fully embraced. Wolf's other film credits include Strictly Business, starring Halle Berry and débuting Mary J. Blige; Three Kings, where Wolf worked with director David O. Russell and actor Mark Wahlberg; and the Harrison Ford drama Presumed Innocent. Emmy winning television music production and composition Over the span of nearly two decades, Wolf's musical creations have been featured in thousands of television episodes including top rated shows such NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles, The Good Wife, ER, The X-Files, Fox Sports and ABC News' 20/20. Wolf's introduction to branding music for television came when Fox asked him to write original music for its Health Net cable. Then in 1999, he was asked to write original themes and identification music for the Fox Sports Network. The Hollywood Reporter explained, \\"it's his job to come up with two-minutes pieces of music that are flexible enough to work with sports as diverse as golf and beach volleyball, and distinctive enough to work as a branding device for the network\\". Since 1999, Fox has used Wolf's themes for almost two dozen network sports programs. The wide variety of Fox Sports themes & underscore cues that Wolf has composed have been played on thousands of sports broadcasts ranging from Major League Baseball, NASCAR and NFL to women's volleyball and golf. Wolf's animation experience from Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase project led to his job composing for the Warner Bros. top rated Saturday morning show Static Shock — a project that would earn him various awards. \\"The beauty of doing a show like this is that you can draw on a broad spectrum of styles,\\" Wolf says, \\"Superhero animation tends to be music-driven, and it can be a virtual playground for composers... The breadth of creative self-expression is truly liberating, especially after coming from the field of record production, where you're invariably pigeonholed into a single genre\\". The score combined hip-hop and electronica with a traditional orchestration and brought an edgy urban soundtrack to Saturday morning cartoons. The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences recognized the originality of the score by awarding Wolf Daytime Emmy nominations two years in a row and as well as an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition and Direction in 2004. Another one of Wolf's impressive television credits comes from Tyra Banks' hit television series, America's Next Top Model. For over fourteen seasons the show has relied heavily on Wolf's original music for everything from hip-hop tunes to themes for judging and elimination sequences. In 2008, a special issue of The Hollywood Reporter honored the 100th episode of ANTM and cited Wolf's musical contributions, explaining how the \\"music elevates the drama among competitors\\". Working from his boutique music production and publishing company, The Producers Lab, Inc., Wolf continues to write and produce music for long time projects such as NCIS, 20/20 News, Fox Sports, ABC News, and ANTM as well as a variety of others.  Author and educator  Wolf is on the faculty of the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music where he teaches classes on music in media and culture, and the special relationship between musical practice and mindfulness practice.

History The station was built because of increased passenger numbers and increased productivity within the St. Marys Munitions Works site along with the arrival of electrification in 1957. The station itself was classed as unattended because most of the workers using the station had weekly tickets or return tickets, making ticket selling facilities unnecessary.

Meerut couple thrashed by Yogi Adityanaths Hindu Yuva Vahini askedaccess-date=19 April 2017}} Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) describes itself as “A fierce cultural and social organization dedicated to Hindutva and nationalism.” Its stated objectives are: “the integration of and mutual good faith within the massive Hindu society, through the complete abolishment of the differentiation between touchable-untouchable and high-low, promote the harmonious development of society.” However cow protection, fighting against Love Jihad and performing Ghar Wapsi are said, per media reports, to have been top priority on the Hindu Yuva Vahini's agenda. Charges and accusations The organisation has been involved in communal violence. The Hindu Yuva Vahini has been charged by the police in the Mau riots of October 2005, where they organized the Hindu forces in opposition to a mafia don turned politician Mukhtar Ansari, the alleged murderer of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state legislature member Krishnanand Rai. Charges of inciting riots, murder, and arson were brought against Hindu Yuva Vahini leaders, along with Ansari and some others in the opposite camp. Eventually, a curfew was imposed on Mau for nearly a month. In January 2007, they were accused of burning mosques, homes, buses and trains in Gorakhpur when claims of the Gorakhpur temple being attacked emerged. This led to the arrest of Yogi Adityanath and 130 other members. After these arrests, the members were suspected of setting ablaze two coaches of the Mumbai bound Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express. The organization was charged with burning an entire Muslim family to death in Vatoli, Adilabad, Telangana (then Andhra Pradesh) in 2008. However, Adilabad District Sessions Court judge Aruna Sarika quashed the case against all the nine accused arrested in this connection, all members of this organization due to lack of proper technical and scientific evidence produced by the Indian investigation agency CB CID.

Their common names refer to the fact that they are the smallest member of the family Pythonidae and are often found in termite mounds. The specific epithet is derived from the state capital, Perth, despite the fact that this place is not within the range of the species. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults grow to about in length and have a weight near 210 grams. Neonates are about in length and about 4 grams in weight. After a year they average about 25 grams in weight. This makes them smaller than either the Children's python, A. childreni, and the spotted python, A. maculosa. A. perthensis usually has a redder background ground color than these other species and their spots fade, or become less distinct, as they mature. In contrast, the ground color is lighter in childreni and maculosa, while their spots stay better defined throughout their life. Distribution and habitat Found in Australia in the northwest of Western Australia and on some coastal islands. The type locality given is \\"Perth, West Australia\\" (Western Australia); an erroneous assumption of the place where the specimen was collected. The unfamiliarity of Europeans with the place of a specimen's collection has given rise to other 'naming peculiarities'. According to L.A. Smith (1985), the type locality is unknown. Housing In captivity anthill pythons can be housed (and bred) in something as small as a 5.5 gallon tank. Although reptile specific enclosures are best, a simple fish tank may be used for short or long-term housing. They may be fed mice as part of their regular diet and supplemented with fuzzy rats. Anything larger is usually a stressor on their system even though they will still try to eat it. Once anthill pythons get started eating they rarely refuse a meal except for breeding season or during part of their shedding cycle. After only about 6 months they still are measured in gram weight due to their small \\"pocket\\" size. Reproduction The pygmy python is oviparous, with 5-8 eggs per clutch. The females will stay coiled around the eggs (lifting them off the substrate) and incubate them until they hatch, which is usually after 50–60 days. In captivity This snake is a popular exotic pet.

The city of Pergamum  Founded sometime during 8th century BC, prior to the Hellenistic Age, Pergamum or Pergamon was an important ancient Greek city, located in Anatolia. It is now the site of the modern Turkish town, Bergama. Ruled by the Attalid dynasty, the city rose to prominence as an administrative center under King Eumenes II of Pergamum, who formed an alliance with the Roman Republic, severing ties with Macedonia. Pergamon Acropolis, drawn by 19th century German archaeologists Under the rule of Eumenes II (197–160) Pergamum was a wealthy, developing city with a population of over 200,000 people. Culturally it was rivaled only by the cities of Alexandria and Antioch. Many important works of sculpture and architecture were produced at this time, including the Great Altar of Pergamon. Upon the death of Attalus III, son of Eumenes II, in 133 BC, Pergamum was bequeathed to the Roman Republic. After the fall of Constantinople, Pergamum became part of the Ottoman Empire. Pergamum was also an important city in the New Testament and was explicitly mentioned by St. John as one of the Seven Churches of Revelation in the Book of Revelation. The ruins of Pergamum and its library are now major archaeological sites in Turkey.  The Library of Pergamum  Pergamum was home to a library said to house approximately 200,000 volumes, according to the writings of Plutarch. Built by Eumenes II between 220 and 159 BC and situated at the northern end of the Acropolis, it became one of the most important libraries in the ancient world. The cultured Pergamene rulers built up the library to be second only to the Great Library at Alexandria. Flavia Melitene, who was a distinguished citizen of Pergamum and wife of a town councillor, was instrumental in supplying the library.Pearcy, L. T. (1988). Galen's Pergamum. Archaeology, 38(6), 33-39. She also presented a statue of Hadrian to the library as a gift. It is known that a certain Artemon was employed in the library during the second century B.C. though his personification is obscure.Broggiato, M. (2011). Artemon of Pergamum: A historian in context. Classical Quarterly, 61(2), 545-552. No index or catalog of the holdings at Pergamum exists today, making it impossible to know the true size or scope of this collection. The library consisted of four rooms, the largest of which was the main reading room (44.5 feet x 50 feet), lined with many shelves. An empty space of approximately was left between the outer walls and the shelves to allow for air circulation, intending to prevent the library from becoming overly humid in the warm climate of Anatolia, an early attempt at library preservation. A 3-meter (10 foot) statue of Athena, modeled after her statue in the Parthenon, stood in the main reading room. Library of Pergamum before excavation, 1885 Manuscripts were written on parchment, rolled, and then stored on the shelves. In fact, the word \\"parchment\\" itself is derived from Pergamum (via the Latin pergamenum and the French parchemin). Pergamum was a thriving center of parchment production during the Hellenistic period. The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose indicating that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of papyrus, which had become monopolized by the rival city of Alexandria. This however is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.Green, Peter. Alexander to Actium. The historical evolution of the Hellenistic age, p. 168. Parchment reduced the Roman Empire's dependency on Egyptian papyrus and allowed for the increased dissemination of knowledge throughout Europe and Asia.  Competition  Although the library of Pergamum was built roughly a century after the library of Alexandria,https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-fierce-forgotten-library- wars-of-the-ancient-world the two had a fierce rivalry, as libraries were often used to reflect wealth and culture. The two libraries competed for parchment, books, and even literary interpretation. Pergamum also hired some Homeric scholars, who studied the Iliad and the Odyssey. This resulted in a fierce rivalry in which each library tried to obtain copies of Homer's works, striving to have the most accurate and oldest works. They also tried to attract better scholars by offering competitive pay. Ultimately, this rivalry forced both libraries to innovate and improve.  Decline  The Kingdom of Pergamon fell to the Romans in 133 BC and the library grew neglected. According to a legend relayed by Plutarch, Mark Antony seized the collection of 200,000 rolls and presented them as a gift to his new wife Cleopatra in 43 BC, presumably in an effort to restock the Library of Alexandria, which had been damaged during Julius Caesar's war in 48 BC. Emperor Augustus returned some of the rolls to Pergamum after the death of Antony, and the library remained extant well into the Christian era, though it was not mentioned much by later historians, indicating its collection was no longer significant. The ruins of the library sit on a hilltop near the Sanctuary of Athena and other buildings of the Pergamon Acropolis.

Today's Sichuan opera is a relatively recent synthesis of 5 historic melodic styles. Regionally Chengdu remains to be the main home of Sichuan opera, while other influential locales include Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei and Taiwan.Chengdu China sichuan opera History Initially there were 5 distinct opera styles.Stanton, Sarah. Banham, Martin. [1996] (1996). The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre. Cambridge press publishing. The history of each style varies greatly. At least one of the Chinese operatic styles began as early as the Three Kingdoms period with some form of Canjun opera. During the Tang dynasty, a band of five came about in Chengdu. In the Song dynasty, the opera developed into zaju. In the Ming dynasty, artists performed the skill in Jinling (modern-day Nanjing). During the reign of Yongzheng and Qianlong emperor in the Qing dynasty, in the Huabu areas, Kunqu, Yiyang, Bangzi and Pihuang melody merged with local languages, folk customs, ditties, yang-kos and Lantern theatre (Dengdiao) in Sichuan. During the early 20th century, a revival movement began to reform the art. The best known reformer was Kang Zhilin, who led the Sanqinq (Three Celebrations) Company. This company was one of the most notable opera troupes, established in 1912, and combined the 5 styles into a single opera on the same stage. Each style retained its own music. One of the classic skills devised by Kang Zhilin included a high kick that leaves a \\"third eye\\" in the middle of the forehead. This has remained one of Sichuan opera's trademark moves. During the Cultural Revolution, the art form suffered somewhat. But it continued to flourish afterwards, especially since the 1978 Chinese economic reform. Performance Overall the art form is well known for its singing, which is less constrained than that of the more popular Beijing opera form. Sichuan opera is more like a play than other forms of Chinese opera, and the acting is highly polished. The music accompanying Sichuan opera utilizes a small gong and an instrument called a Muqin, which is similar to the Erhu. The traditional formula is quite systematic with a combination of stunts like face-changing, tihuiyan, sword-hiding, fire- spitting and beard-changing with the plot and different characters. 5 styles * Gaoqiang (高/高)Ccnt chuanju five melodic styles * Kunqiang (崑/昆) * Huqing voice (鬍/胡) * Tanxi (彈/彈) * Dengdiao / Dengxi / Lantern theatre (燈/灯) Costumes Depending on the style, face paint is also limited compared to other related forms. Jing characters do not appear, and the only painted face characters are those with a small white patch in the middle of the face, which indicates a slightly evil character. The face paint colors are traditionally limited to black, red, white and grey.

Early years The original France XV v New Zealand, 1 January 1906, Paris Rugby was introduced to the Le Havre region of France by British merchants and students in the 1870s and was subsequently spread throughout the schools and colleges. The first clubs were established in the late 1870s and early 1880s, with a club championship soon formed, and games against English clubs organised. The first involvement a national rugby union side had was at the 1900 Paris Olympics, where a French team took part in the tournament and defeated Britain (represented by Mosley Wanderers RFC) 27 – 8 and Germany 27–17 to win the gold medal. However the team represent France at the 1900 games are not considered to be a Test XV. On January 1, 1906 France played its first ever Test match – a 38–8 loss to Dave Gallaher's All Blacks in Paris. In The Complete Rugby Footballer, Gallaher and Billy Stead wrote of French rugby; \\"We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other.\\" France first played England in March of that year, again in France, this time losing 35–8. France played their first Test outside their nation on the January 1, 1907, losing to England 31–13 at the Athletic Ground in Richmond. Two days later they played a game against the Springboks in Parc des Princes, Paris with a side made up from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. Only two of the side that had faced the All Blacks played against the Springboks – three- quarter Paul Sagot and forward Georges Jérôme – and none was in the team that had played England. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55–6. The Five Nations and the Olympics Romania versus France at the Inter-Allied Games of 1919 1924 Summer Olympics. France played Wales for the first time on 2 March 1908, losing 36 – 14 away from home. On March 20, 1909, France played Ireland for the first time, falling 19–8. When Scotland played France in the first official international match between the two countries in 1910, the foundation was laid for a Five Nations competition. Their first win in the competition came against Scotland 16–15 in Paris in 1911. In early 1913, France was host to a touring Springboks party, France lost 5 points to 35, the match was part of an era that last from 1911 until 1920 which saw France lose 18 games in a row. In 1919, the Fédération Française de Rugby was formed, 13 years after France's Test debut. At the 1920 Antwerp Olympics there was another rugby event and France was one of only two teams to enter. A straight final took place between the US and France but the US caused a shock by winning 8–0 to take the gold medal. Their first win in the five nations against Ireland was attained in 1920 in Dublin – 15–7. During their last match of the 1921 Five Nations, France showed signs of new strength beating Ireland 20 to 10. Though France did not win a game the following year, the side did draw with Scotland and England. For the 1924 Olympics held in Paris rugby union was again included. France scored 13 tries to comfortably defeated Romania 59–3, with winger Adolphe Jaureguy scoring four. The final took place at Colombes Stadium in Paris on May 18, 1924 and the US took the gold with a 17–3 victory in front of 30,000 spectators. The All Blacks returned to France in 1925, the first time since their inaugural Test against them in 1906, France lost 6 to 30. Expelled from Five Nations The mid to late 1920s was a period of disappointment for the French, that is until they won their first games over England and Wales, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. France had mediocre results on field during the latter end of the decade and the start of the 1930s, but showed definite signs of improvements in the Five Nations. However, they were expelled from the Five Nations in 1932 following accusations of professionalism in the French league as well as on-field violence and poor organisation and were not allowed to rejoin until 1939. During this time many French players turned to rugby league, which began to build in popularity, as the latter code was excluded from the Five Nations. Despite this there were some internationals played; Germany between 1932 and 1936, Italy (1937) and Romania (1938). On 2 January 1934 FIRA was formed, an organisation to rival the International Rugby Board (IRB). Having been expelled from the Five Nations and forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning spree which still stands today, winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. In 1939, the FFR was invited to send a team to the Five Nations Championship for the following season, but when war was declared, international rugby was suspended. While occupied by Germany during the Second World War, Vichy France banned rugby league and forced its integration into French rugby union. Post war Argentina at Buenos Aires, in 1954. The Five nations resumed after the second World War in 1947 and French rugby came of age. Lucien Mias was the innovative captain whose line- out ploys brought a new attacking dimension to forward play. France beat Wales in 1948 and England in 1951. In 1952, France played their second match against the Springboks and again lost 25–3. France claimed a share of the Five Nations title for the first time in 1954 alongside England and Wales. France also recorded their first win over New Zealand 3–0 at Stade Colombes in 1954. In 1955, France had defeated England, Ireland and Scotland, a win against Wales would give France its first ever Grand Slam. However France lost to Wales 11–16 at Stade Colombes in Paris. The French became the first northern hemisphere country to tour South Africa in 1958. They upset the Springboks by winning the two-Test series. Led by Lucien Mias, in the absence of tour skipper Michel Celaya who had been injured, the underestimated French drew the first Test 3–3 at Newlands and then produced an even bigger shock by beating the Springboks 9–5 at altitude at Ellis Park. That series victory signalled that France were now a top rugby nation. Victories over Scotland and Wales at the Stade Colombes, together with a 3–3 draw with England at Twickenham earned France their first outright Five Nations title in 1959. They arrived in Dublin as champions, only to be denied a Grand Slam by a 9–5 defeat. The sixties Les Bleus scored four tries to one at Cardiff Arms Park and beating Ireland with a record score, 23–6. France's match against England ended in a stalemate and the two sides had to share the 1960 Five Nations trophy. Pierre Albaladejo set a record for the most drop goals, three, in the 23–6 victory over Ireland. France then embarked on a tour of Argentina. In three Tests, France scored 78 points in three victories while the Pumas scored only 12 points. In 1961, the French won the five nations championship outright. The Springboks formidable 1960/61 touring side defeated Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales but were held to a 0–0 draw at Stade Colombes. The game was almost abandoned after fighting broke out. The Tricolours became the first European national team to tour New Zealand in 1961. Les Bleus went on to lose half of the provincial games and both Tests to New Zealand 5–3 and 32–3. The French played a single Test on Australian soil and went home with a 15–8 win over the Wallabies. France won the 1962 Five Nations, but missed out on the Grand Slam again after losing to Wales for the fourth consecutive year. France lost a Test to Romania at the end of the year and in 1964 again toured South Africa. They lost only one of their six games and defeated South Africa 8–6. According to Danie Craven the Test was the worst seen in South Africa up until that time. France set a then record win over England in 1966. After back-to-back Welsh wins, the French won the 1967 Five nations title. The title came down to the last match of the championship against Ireland at Lansdowne Road which France won 11–6, only a 9–8 defeat by Scotland preventing them from winning a Grand Slam. France embarked on their first full-scale tour of South Africa. They were beaten 26–3 in Durban and 16–3 in the \\"Battle of Bloemfontein\\" but were able to come back and win the third 19–14 in Johannesburg and draw the last 6–6 in Cape Town. In 1967, they again won the five nations championship. They returned to South Africa, but lost the Test series 2–1 with one match draw. Fifty-eight years after contesting their first Five Nations tournament, France won their first 'Grand Chelem' with a 14–9 win over Wales at the Arms Park in 1968. However, it was overshadowed by the deaths of Guy Boniface and Jean- Michael Capendeguy in road accidents. They toured New Zealand but once again failed to make an impact, losing the series 3–0. France imploded the following year, losing their first three matches to Scotland, Ireland and England but draw with Wales to deny them a Grand Slam. The seventies Les Bleus continued to feature as a major player in the five nations, finishing first equal in 1970, second in 1971. In 1972, in the final international played at the Yves du Manoir Stadium at Colombes, France marked the occasion by scoring six tries to one and racking up their biggest ever win against England 37–12. Jean Desclaux coached France between 1973 and 1980. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against Wales and they beat England 30–9. 1977 saw France win their second Grand Slam with Jacques Fouroux as captain. No tries were scored against them and they fielded an unchanged team throughout the championship. In November, France beat New Zealand 18–10 in Toulouse but the All Blacks squared the series in Paris by winning 15–3. In the 1978 five nations championship, France met Wales in a Grand Slam decider at the Cardiff Arms Park, the Welsh ran out 16–9 victors. In March 1978, France finally became a full member of the International Rugby Board. France overcame a first Test defeat to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time 24–19 on Bastille day 14 July 1979 at Eden Park. The eighties and early nineties On the 8th of November 1980, France play their last international against South Africa in the apartheid era. They were led by Jean-Pierre Rives and lost 15–37 to the Springboks at Newlands in what was termed the \\"Summer Test\\". Jacques Fouroux became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. In the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions and two Grand Slams (1981 and 1987). France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Famous names from this time included Philippe Sella, Daniel Dubroca and Serge Blanco. In 1981 France clinched the Grand Slam at Twickenham. The 1983 championship came down to the last game played against holders Ireland at Lansdowne Road, Ireland triumphed 22–16. Scotland and France meet in a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield, the Scots secure the Grand Slam. The 1986 Five Nations title is shared by Scotland and France after both won three games and lost one. An inexperienced team New Zealand team arrived in France in the autumn. The vast majority of New Zealand's top players had taken part in a rebel tour of South Africa in 1986 and had been banned. Despite this the 'Baby Blacks' won 19–7 in Toulouse. France won 16–3 over the All Blacks in the 'Battle of Nantes' in 1986. France entered the inaugural World Cup as one of the favourites. France beat Australia 30–24 in the semi final, coming from behind three times to triumph. France were unable to repeat the feat in the final against favourites New Zealand losing 29–9. After an embarrassing 12–6 defeat to Romania on French soil, Fouroux was given the sack. The 1988 Five Nations is shared between France and Wales. France again win the Five Nations in 1989, but are denied the Grand Slam by England, who triumph 11–0. With the ban on playing South Africa lifted, France toured South Africa. Tour captain Jean-Francois Tordo was injured playing against Western Province, and was replaced as captain by Olivier Roumat. France won the Test series following a draw and win over their hosts – the win an 18–17 victory at Ellis Park. The series win was unexpected: they had previously lost to a South Africa B side, lost to provincial side Northern Transvaal, and drawn with Free State province. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals in the 1991 Rugby World Cup. The early 1990s had seen France in the shadow of England. Eight consecutive defeats to Will Carling's teams, starting in 1989, underlined the indiscipline of French rugby. An isolated Five Nations title came in 1993, as England slipped to defeats in Cardiff and Dublin. In 1992, Argentina stunned France 24–20 in Nantes, the Pumas' first ever win on French soil. On their 1994 tour of New Zealand, the French, under captain Philippe Saint-André, recorded a 2–0 series win over the All Blacks. The series win was sealed by the famous \\"try from the end of the world\\", which saw Saint-André begin a counterattack from deep in France's end in the final minutes that ended with Jean-Luc Sadourny scoring the winning try. France were desperately unlucky to lose in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual champions South Africa in 1995. The miserable run against the English finally came to an end in the third place play-off at the 1995 World Cup. Professional era France (white) playing Scotland in 2004. As the game adjusted to the new professional era, the Championship was very much dominated by England, who coming off the 1995 win, backed up with a tournament win in 1996. During the tournament, France actually defeated England, but it was their one-point loss to Wales that prevented them from taking the title. After the Five Nations France hosted Romania, and later travelled to Argentina for a two match series; winning all fixtures. At the end of the year, they met Wales, who had beaten them in their last game of the Five Nations, though this time France won, 40 to 33, though this was followed by two losses to the Springboks at home. After narrowly missing out on the 1996 Five Nations championship, France entered the tournament with confidence, and went through the competition undefeated. After the win, France played aspiring Five Nations entrants Italy, who defeated France 40 points to 32. After defeating Romania, France continued on to Australia for a two Test series, which they lost. At the end of the year, France defeated Italy, Romania and Argentina at home, and against host South Africa for a two Test series, losing both, the second by 40 points. Despite performing poorly against the southern hemisphere teams of Australia and South Africa in 1997, France successfully defended their Five Nations title, and again completed a grand slam of the tournament, even defeating Wales 51 to nil. France also hosted Australia at the end of the year, though the Wallabies won, 32 to 21. Their Five Nations title defense was off to a weak start, after defeating Ireland by just one point. France went on to lose every other match and finished wooden-spoonists in the last ever Five Nations. Bernard Laporte became the first fully professional head coach at the end of 1999. After mixed results during the mid-year, France stormed through the group stages at the 1999 World Cup to finish atop of their pool. After defeating Argentina 47 to 26 in the quarter-finals, France proceeded to the semi-finals, where they met red hot favourites, the All Blacks. Trailing by 14 point at the beginning of the second half, Fabien Pelous' troops mounted an outstanding display of attacking rugby, scoring 30 consecutive points to triumph 43–31. In the final, they met Australia; fatigue took hold as they were beaten convincingly 35 to 12 at Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium. 21st century In 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations, making the tournament the Six Nations. France did not perform to expectations in the revamped tournament, losing to both England and Ireland and finishing second behind England. After defeating Romania 67 to 20, France hosted Australia in Paris, who beat them 18 to 13 in a 1999 World Cup final re-match. This was followed by a two Test series against the All Blacks, which France lost one and won one. France again did not perform that well in the 2001 Six Nations, losing to Ireland, Wales and England; and only finishing fifth. They did however manage victories over South Africa and Australia at the end of the year, as well as an impressive 77 to 10 win over Fiji. France went undefeated in the 2002 Six Nations Championship to claim the first Six Nations grand slam. Though they later lost two games to Australia, France defeated South Africa, and drew with the All Blacks that year. France is No. 1 International ranking in 2002. France playing Wales during the 2007 Six Nations Championship. France lost two matches at the 2003 Six Nations, including their opening game with England, who would go on to win a grand slam. France finished only third. After the strong showing at the World Cup, France reproduced their Six Nations success of 2002 at the 2004 Six Nations Championship. France won all five of their matches to win the tournament and complete a grandslam. France finished second, behind Wales in the 2005 Six Nations Championship, and the following year at the 2006 tournament, France won again, getting their third Six Nations trophy under Laporte. In preparation for the 2003 World Cup, France played Argentina, the All Blacks and England, with mixed results. France won their opening match against Fiji at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, which saw them continue undefeated through the rest of the pool stages. They met Ireland at Telstra Dome in Melbourne in the quarter finals, which they won 43 points to 21. France then met England at Telstra Stadium in Sydney, and went down seven to 24. At the same venue, France contested for third place with the All Blacks, and lost, finishing fourth overall in the tournament. The following year France completed a tournament grand slam of the 2004 Six Nations, including a win over World Champions England. After a short successful tour of North America, France played southern hemisphere teams, Australia, Argentina and the All Blacks; losing all three. In 2005 France completed another strong Six Nations, losing only to eventual grand slam winners Wales. France lost a two Test series to South Africa, and lost to Australia during the mid-year. At the end of the year, France continued Australia's run of losses, and completed heavy wins over Canada and Tonga, and a close victory over South Africa. France lost their opening game of the 2006 Six Nations, 16 to 20 to Scotland, but went on to defeat the other four nations to win the Six Nations. In their final tournament before the 2007 World Cup, France's defence of their title proved again successful, although it came down to the final minutes of their last 6 Nations game to regain the crown. France needed to beat Scotland by more than the Irish beat Italy to ensure that they would be champions again. They were successful, winning the Championship by 4 points. France failed to retain their crown in 2008, finishing third overall. Despite beating Scotland, Italy and Ireland, France's Grand Slam dreams went up in smoke after a poor, aimless performance against England. France also failed to deny Wales the Grand Slam in the final game losing 29–12. France won the Grand Slam again in 2010 by beating England 12–10 in Paris in their final match. France's 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign was marked by turmoil within the camp. Reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach Marc Lièvremont. In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over Japan and Canada, an expected loss to New Zealand, and a shock loss to Tonga. During this stage, Lièvremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players. Veteran number 8 Imanol Harinordoquy responded publicly, attacking Lièvremont for taking his criticism public instead of keeping it within the team. Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players rebelled against Lièvremont, with Harinordoquy telling the French rugby publication Midi Olympique after the tournament, \\"We had to free ourselves from his supervision.\\" The team responded by defeating England 19–12 in the quarter final and controversially beating Wales 9–8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain Sam Warburton was sent off.The Telegraph. Retrieved 2011-10-15. The French proved admirable opponents in the final, losing out to New Zealand 8–7 to finish second for the third time in a Rugby World Cup.

It is located at 53.21 North, -1.49 West. The civil parish is called Holymoorside and Walton. The population of this parish taken at the 2011 Census was 2,223. Close to the boundary of the Peak District National Park, Chatsworth House lies seven miles to the west of the village. History Holymoorside once hosted four public houses but only two remain: The Lamb Inn and The Bull's Head. The Lamb Inn was part of a butcher's business dating back to 1851, with the present design of the pub dating from 1953 when the shop moved to new premises on New Road. The Bull's Head has roots dating back to 1881. There was once a chip shop next to the Lamb Inn, but this burnt down on a bank holiday Monday in 1935. The Old Star, an additional pub on Loads Road but now a private residence dating back to 1820, was notorious for the suicide, by cutting the throat, of a landlord in 1886. Its owners, Chesterfield Borough Council, sold the pub at auction in April 1921, when Mrs H. Dickens secured the sale with a bid of £1500. The Old Star closed in 1959 with a local newspaper report at the time stating that it had been licensed for 300 years. The Woodman's Arms was an alehouse, which only sold beer and not spirits or wines. As the name suggests, the landlord's main occupation was a woodcutter and timber merchant. The earliest mention of the premises in the local trade directories was in 1862. Now a private residence, the building still stands as Sycamore House, on Loads Road near the Lamb Inn. The village has two churches, reflecting the religious history of the \\"Holy Moor\\". Holymoorside Country Store, run by the Kendall family is the only surviving shop in the village. The oldest building in the village is Hipper Hall, an early 17th-century farmhouse with an even older tithe barn which has fallen in to a state of disrepair. However Harewood Grange and Chander Hill Farm date back as far as 1207. The Manloves were proprietors of the cotton thread mill which was built towards the end of the 18th century. This mill employed many of the women and girls of the village, whilst the men and boys worked in the tin mine. The mill buildings, which were three storeys high and were acquired by the Manlove Brothers around 1840, were prosperous for about 50 years, employing 200 people at its peak, but closed in 1902 and now hardly a trace remains of their existence. After 1902 the site was demolished, and in 1930 a row of houses called Riverside Crescent replaced the mill. Belmont House was a large private residence just off Chatsworth Road. It was built in the 18th Century and had a large tower and flying buttresses. The tower was rumoured to be haunted and local legend has it that a cannon was fired from the top of the tower towards Gladwin's Mark a few miles south. Belmont was demolished in the early 2000s and new apartments have been built on the site. Holymoorside Primary School moved to its present site in the Doghole hamlet area of Holymoor Road in June 2002. Customs The traditional Derbyshire custom of well dressing is maintained in Holymoorside. The Well Dressing is on display in late August. As well as well dressing, nativity scenes are also displayed in the shelter on Cotton Mill Hill around Christmas. \\"Holymoorside and Walton Arts Festival Society\\" arrange events throughout the year, including the scarecrow making event in August each year which involves the whole village. The local scout group also holds community events such as the Christmas Fair and 10K run in May. Political Representation Since 2009, the local Derbyshire County Council representative has been Mr Stuart Ellis who is a member of the Conservative Party. Local amenities are provided by Holymoorside and Walton Parish Council, under the district council of North East Derbyshire. The district councillors are Martin Thacker MBE JP and Peter Elliot. Lee Rowley has been the Conservative MP for North East Derbyshire since 2017.  School  There has been a school in Holymoorside since 12 February 1872, which was constructed and funded by the mill-owning \\"Manlove\\" family. The school was situated on New Road before moving to its current location in the Doghole hamlet area of Holymoor Road in June 2002. The old school buildings have been converted into apartments. The original school bell hangs from the wall in the current school's reception area. The school site was previously an orchard, which had been compulsorily purchased by the council in 1931. Proposals to construct an Approved school in the 1950s were not followed through and the site continued use as an orchard full of apple trees and several greenhouses used to grow fruit and vegetables for a local market stall. Construction began in 1999. The school features eleven classrooms, a music room, library and a large hall used for assemblies, dining and PE. There is also a 52 place nursery. The grounds of the school include a turning circle, playgrounds with climbing frames, a large field for sports, and a pond and a wood to the North of the site used for Forest School activities. The school was rated 'Good' by Ofsted in 2018.  Local Folklore and Supernatural Activity  The village lies on the Eastern edge of Beeley Moor, which has many tales associated with it, including a lost traveller who can be heard moaning on the first full moon in March. In addition, there is a large beast-like animal that has been known to dart in front of cars on the moors. There are several tales of the supernatural throughout the village. An area near the River Hipper called Little Blackpool is reputedly haunted by a hooded figure and the ghost of a murder victim and her dog. The figure of Mary Queen of Scots has been seen at Hipper Hall. Monks from Beauchief Abbey have been sighted walking along Chander Hill Lane and near Harewood Grange, where there was a monastery farm. Local legend has it that there is a tunnel from Chander Hill Farm under Holy Moor to Harewood Grange. Hunger Hill Pumping Station is notorious locally for satanic rituals that once took place there. Today the site, nestled down in a wooded valley, has a distinctive eerie feeling to it and unusual mists have shown up on photographs taken inside the abandoned building. Walton Holymoorside Primary School is haunted by lights turning themselves on in the evenings when the school is locked up, along with loud banging noises and footsteps in an alleyway when no one is on the site.
