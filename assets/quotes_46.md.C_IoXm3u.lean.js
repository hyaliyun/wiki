Jewish translations  Medieval Spanish Jews had a tradition of oral translation of Biblical readings into Spanish, and several manuscript translations were made, either for Jewish use or for Christian patrons, for example the 1430 Alba Bible. However, restrictions were placed on the private ownership of Spanish translations of the Bible, partly as a measure against Protestantism and partly for fear that crypto-Jews would use them as a resource for learning Jewish practices. Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain, the refugees took these versions with them. In 1553 a printed version, known as the Ferrara Bible, was made in Latin characters for Duke Ercole II d'Este of Ferrara. In Constantinople and Salonica Bibles were printed in Hebrew, flanked by translations into Ladino and Judaeo-Greek in Hebrew characters, for the use of the Sephardi Jews. Some later prints contained the Ladino text alone. Reina-Valera translation The classic Spanish translation of the Bible is that of Casiodoro de Reina, revised by Cipriano de Valera. It was for the use of the incipient Protestant movement and is widely regarded as the Spanish equivalent of the King James Version. Bible's title- page traced to the Bavarian printer Mattias Apiarius, \\"the bee-keeper\\". Note the emblem of a bear tasting honey. The first whole Bible in Spanish was printed in Basel in 1569, authored by Casiodoro de Reina, although some think that this Bible was a collective effort of some monks of the San Isidoro community in Spain, who, led by Casiodoro de Reyna, escaped Inquisition and persecution. This was the first version of the complete Bible in Spanish (including Apocrypha), and is known as \\"Biblia del Oso\\" because of the honey- eating bear on its title page. Reina presented the University of Basel with some volumes, one of them with Reina's dedicatory and signature. For the Old Testament, the work was possibly based on the Ferrara Bible (printed 1553), with comparisons to the Masoretic Text and the Vetus Latina. The New Testament probably derives from the Textus Receptus of Erasmus with comparisons to the Vetus Latina and Syriac manuscripts. It is possible that Reina also used the New Testament versions that had been translated first by Francisco de Enzinas (printed in Antwerp 1543) and by Juan P√©rez de Pineda (published in Geneva 1556, followed by the Psalms 1562). After the publication of the whole Bible by Reina, there was a version from Cipriano de Valera (printed in London 1596) which became part of the first Reina-Valera print (Amsterdam 1602). This edition of the Reina-Valera Bible has been revised in the 17th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries (1602, 1862, 1865, 1909, 1960, 1977, 1989, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012). The discussion on these revisions especially concerning the 1960 version resulted in the \\"Monterrey Revision Project\\", as well as others, aiming at a revision of the original version of 1602 according to the Textus Receptus. The Reina-Valera Bible and most of its subsequent revisions, with the notable exceptions of the 2011 and 2015 revisions which uses \\"El Se√±or\\" (The Lord) and the 1990 revision which uses \\"El Eterno\\" (The Eternal), feature the divine name based on the Hebrew Tetragrammaton rendered as \\"Jehov√°\\" (Jehovah) throughout the Old Testament starting at Genesis 2:4. The Reina-Valera Bible is one of the Bible Versions authorized to be used in Spanish language services of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.The Canons of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church: Canon 2: Of Translations of the Bible Catholic translations Catholic Bibles contain the entire canonical text identified by Pope Damasus and the Synod of Rome (382) and the local Councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397), contained in St. Jerome's Latin Vulgate translation (420), and decreed infallibly by the Ecumenical Council of Trent (1570). Their official publication requires approval by the Holy See or conference of bishops.Code of Canon Law, canon 825 The Bible was first translated into Castilian Spanish in the so-called Pre-Alfonsine version, which led to the Alfonsine version for the court of Alfonso X (ca. 1280). The ' appeared in 1825. Traditionalist Catholics consider this to be the best Spanish translation because it is direct translation from St. Jerome's Latin Vulgate, like the English language Douay-Rheims Bible. Of more recent versions, the first official translation of the complete Catholic Bible was done by N√°car-Colunga (1944), followed by Bover-Cantera (1947) and Straubinger (1944‚Äì51). The most widely accepted Catholic Bible is the Jerusalem Bible, known as \\"la Biblia de Jerusal√©n\\" in Spanish, translated from Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek with exegetical notes translated from French into Spanish, first published in 1967, and revised in 1973. It is also available in a modern Latin American version, and comes with full introductory texts and comments. This particular Catholic Bible version has the interesting distinction of rendering the divine name based on the Hebrew Tetragrammaton as \\"Yahv√©\\" (Yahweh) as opposed to the most common rendering of \\"El Se√±or\\" (The Lord) throughout the Old Testament text starting at Genesis 2:4. Other popular versions include Biblia Latinoamericana (1972), Nueva Biblia Espa√±ola (1975), Cantera-Iglesia (1975), Sagrada Biblia (1978), Dios Habla Hoy (1979), La Biblia (1992), Biblia del Peregrino (1993), Biblia de Am√©rica (1994) and La Biblia de Nuestro Pueblo (2006). In recent years several ecumenical versions that carry the deuterocanonical books, for example \\"Dios Habla Hoy\\" from the UBS, have been approved by the CELAM (Latin American Episcopal Council) for study purposes. Their acceptance, however, is limited and their use in liturgy avoided due to claims of inaccurate translations in key passages for Catholics like Luke 1:26-38, 40‚Äì45; John 20:22-23; 21:15-17. In 2010 the Conference of Spanish Bishops published an official version of the Holy Bible in Spanish for liturgical and catechetical use. Many of these Catholic translations are also the Bible Versions authorized to be used in Spanish language services of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.  Messianic translations  Las Sagradas Escrituras, Versi√≥n Israelita Nazarena The Old and New Testaments have been translated into Spanish by Messianic translators, edited by Editorial Hebraica and published by El Candelero de Luz, Inc. with an introduction by J.A. Alvarez under the title Las Sagradas Escrituras, Versi√≥n Israelita Nazarena (The Sacred Scriptures, Israelite Nazarene Version) in Puerto Rico in 2012. The Old Testament books follow the same order as the Jewish Bible and also includes Psalm 151. This translation is only available in Spanish. The Old Testament is based on the Hebrew Masoretic Text while the New Testament is based on the Novum Testamentum of Westcott & Hort (The New Testament in the Original Greek). This translation uses the divine name of the Hebrew tetragrammaton which renders it as Yahweh and/or Elohim throughout the text, while the Messiah's name is rendered Yahoshua as opposed to the more common and popular form of Yeshua or Jesus. The Holy Spirit is rendered Esp√≠ritu de Yahweh or Santidad (Spirit of Yahweh or Sanctity) as opposed to the more common Esp√≠ritu Santo (Holy Spirit). This translation utilizes Hebrew names for people and places as opposed to the more common Greek/Spanish equivalents. Bible names are in italicized Hebrew (transliterated in the Roman alphabet) alongside their equivalent Spanish names. This edition comes with an appendix and a Hebrew glossary to aid the reader in interpreting Hebrew names and words for people, places, objects and concepts such as the Hebrew word malakhim which is rendered mensajero (messenger) as opposed to the more common Spanish word √°ngel. This Spanish language Messianic Bible was geared and oriented towards the growing Messianic Jewish movement in Latin America, Spain and Israel, where there is a Sephardic Jewish presence, as well as a growing number of Hispanic and Sephardic members in the Messianic Jewish movement in the United States of America and Canada.

History The district was established in 1896, then named Talat Mai District. It was renamed Sam Phran in 1917. The name Sam Phran, meaning 'three hunters', refers to three hunters of Thai folklore. The district was the site of the Kader Toy Factory fire in 1993, the worst industrial factory fire in history. The factory was owned by the Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, a Thai transnational corporation and one of Asia's largest agribusiness firms. Geography The district is elongated in an east-west direction and neighbouring districts are (from the north clockwise) Mueang Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Chai Si, and Phutthamonthon of Nakhon Pathom Province, Thawi Watthana District and Nong Khaem of Bangkok, Krathum Baen and Ban Phaeo of Samut Sakhon Province, and Bang Phae of Ratchaburi Province. The main water resource of the district is the large Tha Chin River or Nakhon Chai Si River which meanders through the district in a southeasterly direction. Sam Phran District has evolved as a ribbon development of tambons (sub-districts) along Phetkasem Road, a major thoroughfare linking Bangkok with the cities of Nakhon Pathom and Kanchanaburi. Economy The district is the site of two Wai Wai noodle factories, one each in Om Yai and Rai Khing. The Tha Kham Sub- district (usually written Takham), is the centre of the Roman Catholic Christian religion in Thailand. Michael Michai Kitbunchu, Cardinal of Thailand, was born in Sam Phran and many Catholic religious institutes have their convents, monasteries, and headquarters in the area as well as Thailand's major seminary. The largest and most important installation in the Catholic enclave of Tha Kham is the campus shared by Joseph Upatham School, one of the largest combined kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools in the country. It is one of the 43 schools and colleges governed by the Education Department of Bangkok Archdiocese (EDBA). The Ban Phu Waan Pastoral Training Centre, a leading Catholic conference and convention centre is also here. There are several other large private schools in Tak Kham including St. Peter's school (mixed gender, grades K‚Äì9) also governed by the EDBA in the parish of St. Peter, and Marie Upatham, an independent Catholic school for girls in the Tha Kham village of Mor Sii. Sam Phran is the site of the National Police Academy and numerous other colleges including St. Joseph Intertechnology College, a Catholic vocational school and teacher training centre also governed by the EDBA. Administration The district is divided into 16 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 137 villages (mubans). Sam Phran is a town (thesaban mueang) and Om Yai a sub- district municipality (thesaban tambon). There are a further 15 tambon administrative organizations (TAO). { ! No. ! Name ! Thai ! Villages !

They lived at HeketƒÅ, along the northcoast of Tongatapu, with its rocky shore. Launching and landing canoes was difficult and the surf of the sea was always noisy. The nearby village of Kolonga, nowadays is nicknamed Utulongoaa (noisy coast), because that was what Talatama's sister Fatafehi said. Either to please her or just to find a better harbour for themselves Talatama and his younger brother Talaihaapepe decided to move the royal court to Mua (meaning: first, because as the new capital, the village would be the first to receive honours). Indeed, the coast there was sandy and muddy, safe for the boats, the big royal canoes, named ƒÄkiheuho and Tongafuesia, and it was quiet. The place was named Fangalongonoa (silent shore). Since that time, up to the last Tui Tonga, Laufilitonga, the dynasty has always remained in Mua. When Talatama died he had no sons. Talaihaapepe seemed to be the most straightforward one to succeed him, but he himself saw it as a bad omen to break the tradition from father to son. Now when Talaihaapepe had been a boy (some say he was still a boy at that time) he had a doll, made of tou wood, called Tamatou. This doll was declared the son of Talatama and installed with all the pomp and splendour of a Tui Tonga, even a queen was assigned to him, and he was named Tui-Tonga- nui-(ko-e)-tama-tou (Great Tonga king (that is) tou person).This is the only known example where the eastern-Polynesian word nui (big) occurs in the Tongan language; the normal word is lahi. Three years later Talaihaapepe declared that the king, Tamatou, had died and would be buried in a vault,No vault has ever been found at the place pointed out by tradition. while his wife was supposed to have been pregnant and born a son. This son, Talatama's grandson, would succeed as the 14th Tui Tonga. Needless to say that this was Talaihaapepe himself. Notes References * I.C. Campbell; Classical Tongan kingship; 1989 * E.

On October 29, 2018, Sony revealed that the PAL version of the game would be one of 20 games pre-loaded on the PlayStation Classic (excluding Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong), which was released on December 3, 2018. Background The game's predecessor, Cool Boarders, was released for the PlayStation the year prior, in 1996. Despite mixed reviews, Cool Boarders was a sleeper success, and eventually attained a Greatest Hits edition. As snowboarding began to gain in popularity in the West during the late 1990s, so did snowboarding video games. Developer/publisher UEP Systems began work on a sequel to take advantage. Cool Boarders 2 was unveiled at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show, where it drew large crowds despite UEP having only a small booth. Other entries in the genre began trickling in, most notably 1080¬∞ Snowboarding. The original developer, UEP Systems, sold the rights to the name of the series in the US. This resulted in three US-based sequels, while in Japan, the series continued with Cool Boarders Burrrn for the Sega Dreamcast under UEP's guiding force, before \\"ending\\" with the PlayStation 2's Cool Boarders: Code Alien. Reception Cool Boarders 2 received mixed reviews. While most critics found the game's physics model greatly improved from the original Cool Boarders, and the new half-pipe mode was received with great enthusiasm, some felt the overall improvement was not enough to make it the game that Cool Boarders should have been. Next Generation elaborated that \\"The graphics are still choppy, with glaring black seams interrupting the white tracks, and the track design is less than inspiring. However, the half-pipe mode is so much fun that it makes you almost overlook the game's problems. A definite mixed bag.\\" IGN similarly reported, \\"Most of the drawbacks of the first have been addressed in the second game, and a few new things, like the half-pipe, have been added to great effect. However, it is still plagued with problems that afflicted the first, and in some cases are even worse.\\" Conversely, GamePro called it \\"a startling, top-to-bottom improvement upon its predecessor\\", and Crispin Boyer remarked in Electronic Gaming Monthly that \\"I wasn't a big fan of the original, but Cool Boarders 2 surprised me with its depth of gameplay.\\" Critics generally praised the game's vast number of tricks and the complicated button combinations and timings required to pull them off, finding them an engaging challenge. The graphics were less well-received, with many noting a good deal of polygon breakup. Josh Smith of GameSpot, while noting the breakup, felt the smooth animations for the various tricks provide ample visual payoff for the player's efforts. He also praised the freedom the gameplay provides once the player has gotten a basic handle of pulling off tricks. The game received an average score of 70% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 12 reviews.

Gameplay Continuing with the previous games in the series, Cool Boarders 3 gives the player the chance to snowboard down mountain courses while completing tricks to amass points. Some courses like Downhill, Boarder X, and Slalom, require the player to concentrate more on beating their CPU opponents' times to the finish line. While others, namely Slope Style, Half Pipe, and Big Air, force the player to pull off many big tricks in order to build up a large point score. A feature absent from the game which was present in its immediate predecessor is support for the System Link feature, removing the ability for non-split screen, two-player multiplayer. Boarders and boards Unlike the previous games in the series, Cool Boarders 3 featured a vast number of playable characters, along with unlockable characters. At the start of the game, there are 13 different boarders with the chance to unlock 8 extra boarders upon beating the high scores. Cool Boarders 3 also included 11 different snowboards and a further 12 unlockable boards each modeled after real boards from snowboard companies such as Burton and Ride.

Bilimoria is well known for founding the popular global beer brand, Cobra Beer and currently operates as the company's chairman. In addition to his business activity, Bilimoria is a politically active crossbench member of the House of Lords, currently serves as Chancellor of the University of Birmingham and is President of the Confederation of British Industry. Family background Karan Bilimoria was born in Hyderabad, India into a Zoroastrian Parsi family which hailed from Gujarat. As the surname 'Bilimoria' denotes, the ancestral home of the family is the little town of Bilimora, situated on the banks of the river Ambika, in Gandevi taluka of Navsari district of Gujarat state in India. Bilimoria's family had a strong background in trade and commerce, but his father and both his grandfathers served in the Indian armed forces. His paternal grandfather, Nasservanji D. Bilimoria, was one of the first Indians to be commissioned as an officer at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst into the British Indian Army and he retired as a Brigadier. Karan Bilimoria's father, Lt. Gen. Faridoon Noshir Bilimoria PVSM (1933‚Äì2005), popularly known as 'General Billy', had a long and distinguished career in the Indian Army. As a young, newly commissioned officer, he served as ADC to the first President of India, Babu Rajendra Prasad. Many years later, he commanded the 2/5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) during the Bangladesh Liberation War. He later served as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Indian Army's Central Command. In 1990, while serving at that post, Lt. General Bilimoria was deputed by the Government of India to Sri Lanka to review the work of the Indian Peace Keeping Force, which had been deployed in that country during the Sri Lankan Civil War under the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. It was on his recommendation that the force was recalled in 1990, ending India's military engagement with the LTTE. Karan Bilimoria's mother, Yasmin Bilimoria (n√©e Italia), was the daughter of Jamshed D. Italia, a Squadron Leader in the Royal Indian Air Force. Her mother, Aimai Italia nee Bharucha of Hyderabad, was the daughter of D.D. Italia, a Hyderabad-based businessman and politician who served as a member of the Rajya Sabha in the 1950s (this was Karan's maternal great-grandfather). Both his mother and maternal grandfather were educated in Britain at Birmingham University. Early life Karan did his early schooling in Hyderabad from Hyderabad Public School at Begumpet, Hyderabad where the family lived at his mother's ancestral home, Anand Bhavan, while his father served in different military stations in the country. As he grew, his family began to accompany his father, and Karan attended seven different schools before he was sent to board at Hebron School in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, alongside his younger brother, Nadir. When he was still nineteen, Karan received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from Osmania University in Hyderabad in 1981. On receiving a scholarship, he then moved to London where he qualified as a chartered accountant with what is today Ernst & Young and received a diploma in accounting from the London Metropolitan University. Thereafter he read law at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.Biography from dodonline, retrieved 8 September 2006 Not available directly, but available by following the link from House of Lords: Alphabetical List of Members While at Cambridge, Karan played on the university's polo team, organising their first ever tour of India, receiving a Half-Blue in 1988, and led the debating team against Oxford for two years, becoming also the Vice-President of the Cambridge Union before graduating in 1988.http://www.annmorgan.me/Cobra%20interview%20%281%29.pdf In 1993 he married Lynne Heather Walker, a South African national, whom he met through mutual friends. She is an English and Latin graduate of Rhodes University. Founding of Cobra Beer During the India tour of the Cambridge University polo team, Karan noticed that the polo sticks made in India were different and of better quality than those made in Britain. At the time, polo sticks made in Argentina were very popular but following the Falklands War, imports of Argentinian products into Britain had been banned and there was little competition to British manufacturers. Karan began to import polo sticks from India to fill in the gap, selling these successfully and profitably to Harrod's and Lillywhites. He also experimented with importing fashion goods, fabrics, and other products from India, but unlike the polo sticks these were not very successful ventures. In 1989, along with his friend Arjun Reddy, Karan founded Cobra Beer in a little flat in Fulham. The idea for the beer had come up while he was a student at Cambridge, where he regularly ate his meals at Indian restaurants. He noticed that regular lager was too gassy and bloating to be enjoyed with food, while ale was too bitter to accompany a meal. He came up with a concept for a beer that had 'the refreshing qualities of a lager' but the 'smoothness and drinkability of an ale' to accompany food ‚Äì in particular, Indian food and curry. In 1989, after concluding his import- export ventures, Karan and Arjun Reddy started Cobra Beer. At the time Karan had a student debt of ¬£20,000, and funds to start the business were not easy to find. Borrowing money from various sources and ¬£30,000 from a bank, Cobra commenced operations. A brewer in Bangalore, India, Dr Subroto Cariapa, and the owner of Mysore Breweries, Mr Balan, liked the idea of the beer and helped create Cobra. From India, then, it was imported to Britain. In a battered old Citroen 2CV, Karan himself began distributing 15 cases of beer at a time across London and, slowly, outside it. Since marketing on a large scale was not an option because of the paucity of funds, penetrating Britain's highly competitive beer market required an innovative approach. The task was made all the more challenging because by 1990 the country was also in an economic recession. Cobra took off in these circumstances by creating a niche for itself in the market. Indian curry was becoming increasingly popular in the country at the time and so Cobra Beer was marketed and sold as the perfect drink to go with it. Karan himself delivered cases of Cobra to Indian restaurants, where it became very popular with customers. Within five years, the one million mark in sales revenues was crossed.http://www.iilm.edu/iilm- online/Casebook/Cases2007/3.pdf Cobra began to be served across the United Kingdom in thousands of Indian restaurants and the business began to grow, expanding into the pub and bar sector and also being sold in major supermarket chains. In 1999, the company diversified into wine. By 2001 Cobra, from which Karan's partner had now exited, had a turnover of nearly ¬£13 million with a sales growth rate of nearly 60% per year, and was being brewed locally in the UK by Charles Wells Ltd. By 2007 Cobra was being sold in over 45 countries, and had a total production capacity of 450,000 cases per month. Revenues stood at ¬£30 million and, with rapid expansion, were expected to cross ¬£100 million by 2010. The Cobra Beer Partnership On 29 May 2009 the company went into administration. The company owed an estimated ¬£70 million to creditors. Molson Coors, one of the world's largest brewers, then paid circa ¬£14 million for a 50.1% share in a pre-pack administration deal, leaving Bilimoria and his shareholders with the other 49.9%, and signed a joint venture deal under the name the Cobra Beer Partnership, of which Bilimoria is chairman. On 7 October 2009 Bilimoria claimed that the creditors of Cobra Beer will be settled out of future profits of the joint venture.  The Cobra Foundation  In 2005 Lord Bilimoria helped to establish the Cobra Foundation, an independent charity that provides health, education and community support for young people in South Asia. The charity focuses on the provision of safe water and also provides support to disaster relief efforts in the region. Since 2014, the Cobra Foundation has partnered with Belu water to launch a new range of bottled water, with 100% of the profits made donated to WaterAid. This partnership enabled the Cobra Foundation to donate ¬£17,000 to WaterAid's efforts in South Asia in 2015. Chancellor of the University of Birmingham  On 17 July 2014, Lord Bilimoria was installed as the 7th Chancellor of the University of Birmingham. The previous holders of the office were Joseph Chamberlain, Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, Anthony Eden, Sir Peter Scott, Sir Alex Jarratt and Sir Dominic Cadbury.  Panama Papers Controversy  Lord Bilimoria was implicated in the Panama Papers leak: he was listed as a shareholder in Mulberry Holdings Asset Limited, a company registered in the Virgin Islands. However, he released a statement claiming that the company was dormant and had been formed for his ex-shareholders in Cobra, who were not residents of the UK; furthermore he stated that he was taxed on all of his global income in the UK and had declared his interests to the authorities. As a result of these allegations the University of Birmingham Branch of the UCU called for an investigation into his finances in 2016; the University had released a statement the day before calling it a personal matter, referencing Lord Bilimoria's previous statement to the media. Honours and positions Lord Bilimoria was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London in 2001 and he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for his services to business and entrepreneurship.The Queen's Birthday Honours List 2004 (PDF, 628 kB), retrieved 8 September 2006 He was appointed an Independent Crossbench Life Peer in the House of Lords and was created Baron Bilimoria, of Chelsea in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on 16 June 2006. He is the first Zoroastrian Parsi to sit in the House of Lords. Lord Bilimoria has been a non- executive director and Senior Independent Director of the Booker Group PLC, the UK's largest wholesale operator, since 2007. In 2011 he became Chairman of Molson Coors Cobra India, a joint venture between Cobra Beer and Molson Coors in India. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2005. He served as the Bynum Tudor Fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford for the 2017‚Äì18 academic year. In June 2020, Lord Bilimoria was elected as the President of the Confederation of British Industry.

It is significant for being quite probably the first networked multiplayer arena shooter-style game. It may also be the first networked multiplayer action game (although Maze War is another possibility for this distinction).  Gameplay  An Empire screenshot from the \\"PCA vs CERL\\" tournament held August 18, 1984 Although PLATO terminals had touch panels, they did not have mice, and all control in the game is via typing. Commands involving directions to change course and fire weapons are entered as degree headings, with 0 being to the right, 90 up, 180 left, and 270 down. The \\"arrow\\" keys, clustered around \\"s\\", could also be used (e.g. \\"qw\\" being the same as 113 degrees). PLATO terminals had 512 by 512 pixel monochrome vector CRT display screens, and could use downloadable character sets to display graphics. The object of the game is to conquer the galaxy. This galaxy contains 25 planets and 4 races. The races were the Federation, Romulans, Orions, and (originally) Klingons. The fourth race was changed to Kazari, just prior to publication because the game authors were worried about copyright infringement. In 1991, the fourth race name was changed back to Klingon on the NovaNET system, but remained Kazari on the CDC systems. Each team is given three adjacent planets as their home system. Each home system is located towards one corner of the map, which was many screens in size, and thus has two other teams relatively nearby. There are two neutral worlds between each team and its two neighbors, and five more neutral worlds in the middle of the galaxy. Each planet given to a team contains 50 armies at the start of the game, while the neutral planets start off with 25 self-ruled armies. Up to 30 players could be in the game at once, with no more than 15 players on a team. Each player is given a starship to pilot. Players dogfight each other, destroy enemy armies by bombing them, beam up friendly armies to transport them, and beam down armies to take over planets. The ships of each race have slightly different capabilities; Orion ships have the weakest weapons but are fast, Roms have the strongest weapons, but are the slowest, and Fed and Kazari ships have medium speed and strength. (In the VAX Conquest variant, which features engine and weapons temperature statistics, Federation ships have the highest overall speed; Klingon weapons do the most damage; Orions can \\"cruise\\" at a faster speed than others without engine overheat; and Romulans can fire weapons more often without weapon systems overheating.) Ships have two kinds of weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. Phasers fire in a cone shape and do damage immediately, while torpedoes take some time to reach their target and can be dodged. Torpedoes can also be detonated before they strike. When a player is killed, they resurrect in a new ship in their home system, or in any home system that has been conquered by their team. Although an action game, Empire can be slow to play, and moves have to be carefully and yet quickly considered. Flying from a team's home space to engage the enemy could take one to two minutes, and bombing a planet with fifty armies could take five to ten minutes. A game might take many hours, or even days, as players come and go. Yet, in intense dogfighting conditions, players have been known to type as quickly as 20 keys per second (as fast as the system would take them). Original PLATO terminals were connected to the host system with a 1200 baud connection, and the host computers were quite slow by current standards. Since an update of the screen could take one to two seconds with a lot of ships and torpedoes on the screen, players were allowed to decide when their screen updated, but could not delay this action more than 10 seconds, or execute more than a certain number of commands before an update was forced. The position of each ship was updated only when its player updated his screen, which permitted ships to discontinuously hop or \\"hyperjump\\". Conversely, torpedo locations updated whenever any player in the game updated their screen, so their movements were effectively continuous. This simple game mechanic, forced upon the designers by the limitations of the terminal and the central computer, paradoxically gave Empire a great deal of tactical depth by making it a limited-information game. For example, a player, seeing torps launched towards him, could wait without replotting until they were about to be hit, then change course towards the attacker, go to maximum speed, and hyperjump over the torps, then fire his own torps. Since the players could only have a limited number of torps active at any time, the original attacker would have to detonate his torps and launch new ones in order to respond. Of course, an experienced player, knowing that this was likely to happen, would likely have already detonated his first cluster of torps and launched a new set, hoping that his opponent would hyperjump right into them‚Äîexcept that the opponent, knowing this, would do something slightly different. The best players could get inside the heads of other players, figure out what they were going to do, influence them to do certain things, and destroy them. Things were further complicated by the fact that a ship's fuel supply was limited and regenerated fairly slowly; just flying at maximum warp would deplete a ship's fuel supply in minutes. This meant that one had to decide when it was profitable to fire torpedoes, fire phasers, or even to move at all. Orbiting a friendly \\"Class-M\\" planet increased the fueling rate, so defenders could unleash a blizzard of torps‚Äîbut conversely, this meant that they were all in a known location, and a single attacker who hyperjumped just right could unload his torpedo tubes on all the defenders (Torp damage was area-of-effect), \\"clearing\\" the planet and racking up multiple kills. This and other aspects of the game were very well balanced. Game play was also affected by the Plato system's context switching CPU scheduling algorithm. Plato attempted fair allocation of the limited CPU resources available by calculating for each user the ratio of the total CPU time used during a session divided by the total duration of the session. The system would grant extra CPU time to sessions with lower CPU time/session duration ratios at the expense of sessions with higher CPU time/session duration ratios. Empire players would obtain more CPU for game play by logging in hours before commencing game play and leaving the session idle, thereby accumulating a very low CPU used/session duration ratio that would ensure high CPU allocation to the player during game play. Players who did not engage in this practice were burdened with poor game responsiveness due to relative lack of CPU. Empire IV included Strategic play, where the goal was to take over all planetary systems, thus forming an empire. This was achieved by building up armies on one's friendly planets, expanding to non-controlled planets, bombarding enemy planets, and eventually beaming down armies transported from one's own friendly planets. This all while being attacked by potentially three other teams at many fronts.  History  The first version, Empire I, was written by Iowa State student John Daleske as project coursework for an education class in the Spring of 1973. Silas Warner helped out by providing Daleske with disk space (known as \\"lesson space\\" in the PLATO environment). The first version of the game was a strategic turn- based game for a maximum of eight players. Each player was the head of their government, had ships (for both trade and war), industry, and budgets. Players had to keep the budget up to build more ships, maintain industry to help pay for it, provide raw materials to turn into goods, and trade. This was likely the earliest example of an online, multi-player, interterminal computer game. Games prior to this were two player or one player against a computer. Empire I was originally erased and replaced by Empire II but Silas Warner revived it as Conquest. Empire II, written in the Fall of 1973, was substantially different, much more tactically oriented. Players each captained a starship and could fire torpedoes at each other. Silas Warner liked the earlier version, and with Daleske's permission resurrected it under the name Conquest. The initial versions were written in longhand, with no printouts available as Daleske was at a remote computing center. In late 1973, Daleske rewrote the game again, creating Empire III in a 36-hour programming blitz, completing the effort in early 1974. This version of the game, with a few minor modifications (newer looping constructs replace branches, and a timing issue has been corrected) may still be played on the Cyber1 PLATO system. In this version of the game, the internal physics are greatly improved, and the player's ship is always shown in the center of the tactical screen. Up to seven teams and fifty players could participate. Players could opt to be in an eighth \\"rogue\\" or non-affiliated team. The game was substantially revised in 1976 by a team led by Chuck Miller and Gary Fritz, including John Daleske and Jim Battin; by 1977, they produced Empire IV, which allowed for live chat between players. In 1981, Steve Peltz wrote a tournament version of the game, which allowed for annual tournaments between teams. These were most often won by the Orion team. Empire was a very popular game. Usage logs from the PLATO system at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) at UIUC indicate that between 1978 and 1985, users spent about 300,000 hours playing Empire. Empire is still played (as of 2013) on the system at www.cyber1.org. Empire inspired many derivative games, including Trek82, Trek83, ROBOTREK, Xtrek, and Netrek. Empire was adapted without permission for the Apple II computer by Robert Woodhead of Wizardry fame as a game called Galactic Attack. PLATO Conquest (based on Empire I) can still (as of the late 1990s) be found on the NovaNET PLATO systems. In 1982 Jef Poskanzer wrote a version of the space-battle Empire game called Conquest for VAX/VMS computers.

He was a player for the club SV Waldhof Mannheim. He also played for the Germany national football team, making 31 appearances and scoring 17 goals between 1934 and 1938. He was a participant in the 1934 FIFA World Cup, where he scored a goal. He was the centre forward of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8‚Äì0 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 out 11 games played during that year. Otto Siffling was one of the most talented center forwards of the 1930s. An opinionated and exceptionally gifted player, Siffling was a virtuoso on the pitch who impressed with his ingenuity and imagination when on the ball. Being not keen on overly physical play, he was not a traditional center forward, preferring to create more than to score.Bitter, J√ºrgen.

In 1938 his level suddenly dropped inexplicably, so that he was not starting in the 1938 World Cup. A year later he died of a pleurisy aged 27. In his 1978 book Fussball, Helmut Sch√∂n characterised Siffling as follows: \\"As a center forward he was not a tank but a playing center forward who still was enormously dangerous in front of the goal; in the famous game in Breslau he scored five goals.

Broadcom's product offerings serve the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, and storage and industrial markets. Tan Hock Eng is the company's president and CEO. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California. Avago Technologies Limited took the Broadcom part of the Broadcom Corporation name after acquiring it in January 2016. The ticker symbol AVGO that represented old Avago now represents the new merged entity. The Broadcom Corporation ticker symbol BRCM was retired. Broadcom has a long history of corporate transactions (or attempted transactions) with other prominent corporations mainly in the high-technology space. In October 2019, the European Union issued an interim antitrust order against Broadcom concerning anticompetitive business practices which allegedly violate European Union competition law.  History  What would become the company was established in 1961 as a semiconductor products division of Hewlett-Packard. The division separated from Hewlett-Packard as part of Agilent Technologies in 1999. KKR and Silver Lake Partners acquired the chip division of Agilent Technologies in 2005 for $2.6 billion and formed Avago Technologies. Avago Technologies agreed to sell its I/O solutions unit to PMC-Sierra for $42.5 million in October 2005. In August 2008, the company filed an initial public offering of $400 million. In October 2008, Avago Technologies acquired Infineon Technologies' Munich-based bulk acoustic wave business for ‚Ç¨21.5 million. In 2009, Avago Technologies went public on NASDAQ with the ticker symbol AVGO. Avago Technologies announced its agreement to acquire CyOptics, an optical chip and component supplier, for $400 million in April 2013. The acquisition aimed to expand Avago Technologies' fiber optics product portfolio. In October 2013, Avago Technologies invested $5 million in Amantys, a power electronics technology provider, as part of a strategic investment agreement between the two companies. Avago Technologies announced its agreement to acquire LSI Corporation in December 2013 for $6.6 billion. The acquisition helped move Avago Technologies away from specialized products and towards a more mainstream industry, which included chips, especially storage for data centers. The company sold its SSD controller business to Seagate Technology in May 2014. In August 2014, the company was the ninth largest semiconductor company. Avago Technologies agreed to sell LSI's Axxia Networking business to Intel for $650 million. The company also agreed to buy PLX Technology, an integrated circuits designer, for $309 million. In February 2015, it was announced that Avago Technologies Limited had reached an agreement to acquire Emulex Corporation for $8 per share in cash. On 28 May 2015, Avago announced that it would buy Broadcom Corporation for $37 billion ($17 billion cash and $20 billion in shares). The combined company, which would be named Broadcom Ltd., would have annual revenue of $15 billion and a market value of $77 billion. Broadcom Corp. strengthened Avago Technologies' patent position significantly in sectors such as mobile, the data center and the Internet of Things and made the company the ninth largest holder of patents among the top semiconductor vendors, according to an analysis by technology consulting firm LexInnova. According to the company's web site, the transaction closed on 1 February 2016. In 2016, Broadcom proposed merging with Brocade Communications Systems. The merger was delayed for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In 2017, Broadcom announced it would relocate its legal address from Singapore to Delaware, which would avoid the review. This action was linked to the parent company being renamed from Broadcom Ltd. to Broadcom Inc. The pre-2016-merger Broadcom, Broadcom Corp., remains as a wholly owned subsidiary of the renamed parent Broadcom Inc. In November 2017, Broadcom proposed to purchase Qualcomm for US$130 billion, which was rebuffed by Qualcomm's board. President Trump blocked the revised $117 billion merger by an executive order that cited national security concerns. On 11 July 2018, news sources reported that Broadcom and CA Technologies agreed on terms for $18.9 billion acquisition. And on 5 November 2018 Broadcom announced that it had completed the acquisition of CA Technologies. On 9 August 2019, news sources reported that Broadcom had decided to acquire the enterprise security business of Symantec Corporation (the consumer software portion of which is now known as NortonLifeLock) for $10.7 billion in cash.

History It was established in the reign of King Maha Chakkraphat of Ayutthaya kingdom. When King Chulalongkorn created the Monthon as part of the Thesaphiban administrative reform, Mueang Nakhon Chai Si was the capital city of Monthon Nakhon Chai Si. Later when the government gave up the system, Mueang Nakhon Chai Si was downgraded to be a district of Nakhon Pathom. More than 1,000 years ago, Han Chinese called Nakhon Chai Si (including other districts in this region, such as Samut Sakhon) according Teochew dialect that Lang-Ka-Su (; pinyin: L√≥ng z«ê cu√≤), refers to 'home of dragon descendant'.

The main water resource is the Tha Chin River, which is named Nakhon Chai Si River in the area of and around the district. Economy In mid-2019, the Department of Airports (DOA) proposed the construction of a new airport in Nakhon Pathom Province, 50 kilometres west of Bangkok, to relieve pressure on Bangkok's two existing airports. The 20 billion baht airport would occupy 3,500 rai of land in Nakhon Chai Si District as well as Bang Len. Its capacity would be 25 million passengers annually. If approved, construction would start in 2023 and the airport would be operational by 2025 or 2026. Administration The district is divided into 24 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 108 villages (mubans). Both Nakhon Chai Si and Huai Phlu have sub-district municipality (thesaban tambon) status. Each of the tambons has a tambon administrative organization (TAO). { ! No. ! Name ! Thai ! Villages !

The amalgamated companies had 1,300 employees and manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, and punched card equipment. CTR was renamed International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.IBM Archives The individual companies continued to operate using their established names until the businesses were integrated in 1933 and the holding company eliminated.For example, the last page of The Inventory Simplified , published in 1923, stated \\"The Tabulating Machine Company ‚Äì Division of ‚Äì International Business Machines Corporation.

A year later his brother, Harlow Bundy, organized the Bundy Manufacturing Company, and began mass-producing time clocks.IBM Archives: George W. Fairchild. In 1900, Bundy Manufacturing sold its time recording business to a new company, the International Time Recording Company. Bundy Manufacturing went on to produce adding machines. In 1906 Harlow Bundy moved his business into a new three-story brick building in Endicott, New York.North Street, Endicott. International Time Recording Company In 1894, J. L. Willard and F. A.

Fairchild, an investor and director of the Bundy Manufacturing Company, led the formation in Jersey City, New Jersey, of the International Time Recording Company (ITR) which consolidated the time recording business of Bundy with the Willard & Frick Manufacturing Co.IBM Archives: 1900. In 1901, the company was re-incorporated in Binghamton, New York. The same year, it acquired the Chicago Time-Register Co., the first autograph time recorder company in the world, and a manufacturer of key, card and autograph employee time recorders.IBM Archives: 1901. In 1906, ITR relocated to Endicott, New York, where it had built a larger factory next to the new building of the Bundy Manufacturing Company. Before the CTR amalgamation, Harlow Bundy would be named ITR's Treasurer and general manager.

Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879 to 82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punched cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input.Officemuseum.com ‚Äì early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment In 1896 the Tabulating Machine Company leased some machines to a railway companyAustrian, Geoffrey D.; Herman Hollerith: Forgotten Giant of Information Processing Columbia University Press NY NY , p. 138. but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day ‚Äì the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract and completing the project, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years. He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his semiautomatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. Flint bought the business for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million) in 1911. Computing Scale Company of America The Computing Scale Company of America was a holding company, organized in 1901 and amalgamating as subsidiary companies The Computing Scale Company, Dayton, Ohio; The Moneyweight Scale Company, Chicago, Illinois; The W.F. Simpson Company of Detroit, Michigan; and The Stimpson Computing Scale Company of Elkhart, Indiana. In 1891, Edward Canby and Orange O.

Amalgamation Charles Ranlett Flint had already created a number of successful consolidations, including creating industrial giant U.S. Rubber Flint amalgamated the four companies into the new CTR holding company.Since the 1960s or earlier, IBM has described its formation as a merger of three companies: The Tabulating Machine Company (1880s origin in Washington, DC), the International Time Recording Company (ITR; 1900, Endicott), and the Computing Scale Company of America (1901, Dayton, Ohio). (Austrian, 1982, p. 312.) (Belden, 1961) (IBM Archives). However there was no merger, it was an amalgamation, and an amalgamation of four, not three, companies. The 1911 CTR stock prospectus states that the Bundy Manufacturing Company was also included. While ITR had acquired its time recording business in 1900, Bundy had remained a separate entity producing an adding machine and other wares (see Early Office Museum) CTR had a bonded indebtedness of $6.5 million, three times its current assets, of which $4 million was borrowed from the Guaranty Trust Company.Flint (1923), p. 312-313. Flint assigned it a value of $17.5 million, while its tangible assets only added up to $1 million. Flint stated that the various manufacturers produced similar but not identical products and that the > ...\\"allied consolidation\\", instead of being dependent for earnings upon a > single industry, would own three separate and distinct lines of business, so > that in normal times the interest and sinking funds on its bonds could be > earned by any one of these independent lines, while in abnormal times the > consolidation would have three chances instead of one to meet its > obligations and pay dividends.Flint (1923), p. 312. CTR's 1911 stock prospectus reported net earnings, from May 1, 1910 to April 30, 1911, of $950,000 for the four companies . Organization and leadership CTR and the four amalgamated companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario. CTR was located in Endicott. The chairman was George Winthrop Fairchild, who, having been a member of Congress since 1906, was not expected to take an active part in management. When the first president left after just one month, however, Fairchild took over and ran CTR until 1912, when Frank N. Kandolf, formerly CEO of the International Time Recording subsidiary, took over. Flint was a member of the board of CTR (and later IBM) until his retirement in 1930.IBM Archives: 1910s. Hollerith, then 51, joined the CTR board and served as a consulting engineer until he retired ten years later. Early Watson era Thomas J. Watson1917 Organizational chart This style of chart, pyramids dividing into five parts, was required by Patterson. One of the many things Watson brought from NCR to CTR.Crowther, Samuel (undated). John H. Paterson ‚Äì The Romance of Business, Geoffrey Bliss Thomas J. Watson Sr., along with 29 other NCR officials, had been convicted in 1913 of various antitrust violations for their roles in a widespread National Cash Register scheme to run used cash register retailers out of business (see NCR Corporation ¬ß Expansion).Austrian, 1982, p. 329. Watson's own extortionate writings were used as evidence against him. That lesson taught Watson to thereafter keep very little in writing. In 1914, having been fired from NCR Corporation and with a prison sentence threatening his future, Thomas J. Watson approached Flint, a leading financier, for assistance in finding a similar job. Despite his apparently perilous situation he was still very clear as to the type of job he wanted. He had already turned down a number of offers. He wanted control of the business for himself, and to be able to earn a share of the profits. Flint offered him CTR. Flint was, as described earlier, a great promoter of trusts and was presumably less worried about Watson's impending jail sentence. The other members of the CTR board were less sanguine, asking who was to run the company while he was in prison. As a result, they only gave him the title of general manager.IBM Archives: Thomas J. Watson, Sr. CTR's general manager, in 1914. After Watson had been at CTR for 11 months, the Appeals Court ordered a retrial. Although he refused to sign a Consent Decree, a new trial never took place, and he was duly promoted by the board of CTR to the position of president. Among the many things Watson brought to CTR from NCR was the motto Think.IBM Archives: Thomas Watson Comments on Think. Watson's strategies Surprisingly, in view of his past record at NCR and his later colossal influence on IBM, Watson initially maintained a very low profile (almost tantamount to seeking obscurity) for the next decade until 1924, when the chairman George W. Fairchild died and he finally took over sole control.IBM Archives: Thomas Watson & George Fairchild. For the whole of the previous decade, in some ways uncharacteristically, he consistently deferred to Flint, Fairchild and Hollerith. IBM song books with Think signs in several languages and punched cards. In the meantime he took personal charge of 400 demoralized and poorly-supervised salesmen. His stated objective was to produce a sales force in the NCR mold, as well as advanced machines that would be superior to any of the competitors' machines. In a series of small meetings he presented his 'competitive proposition' to the sales force. Despite the aggressive-sounding title, right from these beginnings there was as much emphasis on the ethics and philosophies of the business as there was on sales techniques. In particular he stressed sincerity, integrity and loyalty, saying that they should do nothing that could be construed as 'unfair competition' and should conduct themselves in an 'honest, fair and square way' ‚Äì something which would be radical even today. Musical events, even IBM songs, were introduced to improve and maintain employee morale.IBM Archives: IBM Music On a happy note. The other philosophies that motivated CTR and IBM for the next three-quarters of a century were also evident. The company motto was to be 'We sell and deliver service'; CTR was to be in the business of genuinely assisting its customers. Watson strongly believed that when a sale was made both sides came out ahead. Organizational change and strategies CTR was a company with three separate elements: ‚Äì Computing Scale interested Watson the least and the largest element of this (Dayton Scale) was eventually sold off in 1933, to Hobart Manufacturing. After the sale the company, to Watson's chagrin, began making money.Pugh, Emerson W., Building IBM, MIT, 1995, p. 28. ‚Äì Time Recording was at first the main revenue earner, and was used by Watson as a vehicle for diversification, though none of these was great success. ‚Äì The tabulating business most interested Watson, perhaps because it was closest to his NCR experience. This was where he directed much of his attention and by the early 1930s this had indeed become the largest piece of CTR.Belden, 1962, p. 107. In 1920s, while still under Fairchild's domination, Watson focused on achieving a significant degree of growth. Revenue grew from $4.2 million in 1914, when he took over, to the peak of $16 million in 1920. The price of this, however, was a precarious cash position. In 1921, sales fell to $10.6 million and Watson faced a cash-flow crisis. Once again CTR was to be funded, and rescued, by Guaranty Trust. Watson was forced to cut costs across the board, including reducing R & D and laying off employees. He never again allowed his cash position to fall so low. He subsequently maintained a policy of low dividends, high revenues, and careful cost controls. He adopted very conservative accounting principles. Hollerith, beginning with the 1890 census, had rented his machines so that his company could provide the maintenance necessary to assure reliable operation. Watson recognized other benefits including the idea that renting equipment was inherently more stable, since the income continued when equipment orders would otherwise have dried up. Less obviously, it forced sales personnel, aware that they might lose the rental, to maintain regular contact with customers, thus ensuring ‚Äì even as early as the 1930s ‚Äì that customer relationships were well-managed. This approach became central to IBM's activities. Thereafter, Watson deliberately lagged on the introduction of new products, though not on research. Even after competitors launched new products he still waited until the market was ripe for large scale development. Watson recognized the importance of sound R&D;, appointing James W. Bryce in 1922 to manage this (moving him from its Time Recording Division, which he had joined in 1915). However, Watson continued to be personally involved in R&D;, not least through his insistence on rigorous standards. \\"Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR\\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title International Business Machines.Belden, 1962, p. 125. First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary, then as a line in advertisements. For example, the McClures magazine, v53, May 1921, ran a full page ad with the following tag at the bottom: International Time Recording Company of New York Subsidiary of Computing-Tabulating- Recording Company, New York Makers of International Business Machines Patterson died in 1922 and Fairchild died December 31, 1924. On February 5, 1924, Watson submitted an application to list International Business Machines (IBM) on the New York stock Exchange, and (the name) C-T-R disappeared.Maney, Kevin (2003) The Maverick and His Machine, Wiley, p. 89. Watson began to mold the company in his own image and for the next quarter of a century, until he was 75, took it to new levels of success.Rodgers, Think, p. 82-83 He celebrated his new status with the first Quarter Century Club. Even though CTR had only been going for 13 years, he based qualification on the subsidiary companies. The holding company itself disappeared in 1933 after most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.Rodgers, Think, p. 83.

Horst \\"Schimmi\\" Szymaniak (born 29 August 1934 in Oer-Erkenschwick ‚Äì died 9 October 2009 in Melle) was a German footballer who played as a midfielder.  Club career  The clubs Szymaniak played for include: SpVgg Erkenschwick, Wuppertaler SV, Karlsruher SC, Calcio Catania, F.C. Internazionale Milano, A.S. Varese 1910, and Tasmania 1900 Berlin for whom he played in the 1965‚Äì66 season, the side's only season in the Bundesliga. Szymaniak was a defensive midfielder who usually played as a left half back and less frequently as an inside forward. He had very good ball skills, had good vision and was able to make unerringly accurate long passes to a team mate. He was renowned for his slide tackling ability, so much so this became his trademark ability. He was renowned as one of the best players in German football during the late 1950s and early 1960s, with kicker (sports magazine) rating him world class five times between 1957 and 1961 in their biennial Rangliste des deutschen Fu√üballs (ranking list of German football).  International career  Szymaniak played 43 times and scored two goals for the West Germany national football team between 1956 and 1966, and was chosen to play in both the 1958 and the 1962 World Cups, but was omitted by Helmut Sch√∂n from his 1966 squad.

Mixed martial arts career Burnett made his professional MMA debut on April 20, 1996, competing at the third and final Oklahoma Free Fight Federation tournament in Tulsa. Burnett defeated Todd Justice and Tony Hays only to eventually lose to Kevin Nix in the final round of the tournament. Shortly after this, Burnett began to train with Ken Shamrock's Lion's Den in Susanville, California. Burnett's next fight would not take place until the following year at the inaugural World Pankration Championships where Burnett submitted Mike Hipp with a heel hook. Burnett's success attracted the attention of the UFC, who invited Burnett to fight in their organization. Burnett made his victorious UFC debut at UFC 16, stopping Eugenio Tadeu with strikes in the first round. This fight was nominated by the UFC to appear on the UFC's Ultimate 100 Greatest Fights. Burnett's performance earned him a title shot against Pat Miletich to determine the first-ever UFC Welterweight Champion. Burnett lost a controversial decision to Miletich at UFC Ultimate Brazil. Burnett returned at UFC 18 where he won a unanimous decision over Olympic silver medalist Townsend Saunders.

The area which was cleared in 2008 has become green with new vegetation. Koksilah Ridge (Hwsalu'utsum) is an elevated area located south of the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It is centered at 48¬∞42‚Ä≤N, 123¬∞47‚Ä≤W. Its summit lies about above sea level. It is visible in most of the Cowichan Valley and on the Saanich Peninsula north of Brentwood Bay. As seen from North Saanich or Sidney, it is plough-shaped, with long gentle slopes. From north to south, the bedrock lithology begins with Cretaceous-era sedimentary rock, chiefly shale, sandstone and conglomerate. These sediments extend up to about . Above them lies a pluton of Jurassic-age granodiorite, which underlies the summit. Around the eastern, southern and western edges of this pluton is a complex association of Pennsylvanian-era argillite, greywacke, chert and diabase. The soils of Koksilah Ridge are well or rapidly drained gravelly sandy loams and gravelly loamy sands with podzol profile development. They support Coastal Western Hemlock-type forests in which Douglas-fir and western hemlock are most common at lower elevations. These forests are classified under the provincial Biogeoclimactic Ecosystem Classification as Coastal Western Hemlock, Very Dry Maritime Subzone (CWHxm2). Areas above are mapped as Coastal Western Hemlock, Moist Maritime Subzone (CWHmm2), with abundant Douglas-fir, amabilis fir, and western hemlock. The forest industry has been active on Koksilah Ridge for many years and the native forest is interrupted by logged-off areas of varying size. These clear cuts are prominent when a snow cover is present. Snow may lie on the higher parts for up to six months over a severe winter, but is seen on only a few days through a mild winter.

The village is the oldest pilgrimage site in Slovakia and the first pilgrimage site dedicated to Virgin Mary in the area of former Hungarian Kingdom. It used to be as famous as the well known Mariazell in Austria and the Polish pilgrimage place Czƒôstochowa. The communist regime between years 1948-1989 suppressed all religious activity and the village as a pilgrimage site was planned for demise, however the village survived. History http://visit.marianka.sk/History+of+Marianka/Pilgrimage+history/?languageId=6 History of village from tourist website In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1367. First settlers however inhabited area of present-day Marianka already in primeval times. Settlement dating to late Bronze Age located above the slate quarry was discovered during research between 1986 - 1990. Fragments of iron utensils were found along with unusual convenience, a painted floor. The cornerstone of the church was laid by Louis I. the Great in 1377, in response to spreading word about rumoured miracles. The church was finished in 1380 and its administration was given to Order of St. Paul. Pauline Fathers administered the parish for 400 years. During the time Marianka was several times raided by Ottoman forces. The statue of Virgin Mary had to be hidden in Paj≈°t√∫n fortress. The number of pilgrims rose with its peak in 1730 when 50,000 visitors attended the church service. To meet the growing number of visitors, Chapel of St. Anne was built in 1691. Among prominent visitors of Marianka were Sigmund, Leopold I. and Joseph I. Emperor Charles III. came to visit Marianka right after his coronation as Hungarian king in 1712 from Bratislava. Maria Theresa visited Marianka twice with her son Joseph II. Marianka was also a favorite marriage place for local nobility. There was a custom that during this occasion they were giving to the Virgin Mary their wedding rings and also donating robes for the statue made out of their bridal clothes. Turning point in village's history was abolishment of contemplative orders by Joseph II in 1786, because of which the Pauline order had to leave Marianka. From this point onwards Marianka was managed by the local diocese. A new development of the pilgrimage place began in 1927 when Congregatio fratrum consolatorum de Gethsemani managed the site until 1950, when the communist regime abolished all catholic orders. After November 1989 they returned to Marianka and remain until today.

The older legend tells about miraculous healing of children. It speaks of the bloodthirsty bandit, based in the local forests. Although his newborn child was \\"a beast more similar to animal than human\\" and its affliction was considered as God's punishment, he still continued in his brutal ways. But his wife prayed sincerely and asked for mercy and her prayers was heard out. An apparition led her to the stream where her children \\"after washing, turned into healthy and happy children.\\" The news about the miraculous strength of the stream spread all around the country. Large queues of blind, crippled and sick beggars rushed to Marianka with their prayers to drink and wash themselves in the blessed stream. They believed that the miraculous powers of the stream were directly from Virgin Mary, who is called \\"Healer of the sick\\" and \\"Comforter of the afflicted\\" in Marian litany. The second legend tells the story of finding the Virgin Mary of T√°lensk√° statue. The legend dating from the year 1030 speaks about its origin: a god-devoted pilgrim living in the forests carved it out of pear wood. Shortly after finishing the statue, dangerous times came. Country governors were fighting among themselves for the throne, while barbaric riders were raiding and destroying everything Christian. The pilgrim decided to save the statue and hid it in a hollow tree. Years after that, people used to come to this valley from around the country, seeking restoration either physical or spiritual, but none knew where the miracle was coming from. One day, an old blind beggar who was praying in the forest, heard a voice from the heavens. The voice told him that if he washes his eyes in the nearby stream a miracle will happen. As soon as the beggar washed his eyes in the water, they opened and he could see. He saw the statue of the Virgin Mary of T√°lensk√° in the stream and took it from there. He made a pedestal for the statue, and placed an image of Virgin Mary beside it. There he came often to pray to the statue. Although these legends are not regarded as reliable historical source, there are several remarks regarding the Mariathal miracles in the records of the Pauline cloister dating up to year 1661.

Empire is a 1977 turn-based wargame with simple rules. The game was conceived by Walter Bright starting in 1971, based on various war movies and board games, notably Battle of Britain and Risk. The game was ported to many platforms in the 1970s and 80s. Several commercial versions were also released, often adding basic graphics to the originally text-based user interface. The basic gameplay is strongly reminiscent of several later games, notably Civilization, which was partly inspired by Empire. Gameplay At the start of a new game, a random game map is generated on a square grid basis. The map normally consists of numerous islands, although a variety of algorithms were used in different versions of the game, producing different styles of maps. Randomly distributed on the land are a number of cities. The players start the game controlling one of these cities each. The area immediately around the city is visible, but the rest of the world map is blacked out. The city can be set to build armies, aircraft, and various types of ships. Cities take a particular number of turns to produce the various units, with the armies typically being the most rapid. Players move these units on the map to explore the world, typically seeing the land within a one square radius around the unit. As they explore they will find other cities, initially independent, and can capture them with their armies. The captured cities are then set to produce new units as well. As the player's collection of cities expands, they are able to set aside some to produce more time-consuming types, like battleships. Ultimately they have to use these forces to take all the cities on the map, including those of the other players, who are often run by the computer's game engine.  History and development  The initial version of the game was written in BASIC, before being re-written around 1977 in the FORTRAN programming language for the PDP-10 computer at Caltech. This version was spread virally to other PDP-10s, which were common timesharing systems at the time. Later, Bright recoded this in assembly language on a Heathkit H11 and made it available commercially. He sold two copies. At some point, someone broke through the security systems at Caltech, and took a copy of the source code for the FORTRAN/PDP-10 version of the game.Empire-for-PDP-10 on github This code was continually modified, being passed around from person to person. Eventually, it was found on a computer in Massachusetts by Herb Jacobs and Dave Mitton. They ported the code to the VAX/VMS operating system and, under the alias of \\"Mario DeNobili and Paulson\\", submitted the program to DECUS, a large user's group. DECUS programs were often installed on new DEC computers at the time of delivery, and so Empire propagated further. Eventually, Bright heard of this, and in 1983 contacted DECUS, who subsequently credited Bright in the catalog description of the program and re-added his name to the source code. In 1984, Bob Norby from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ported the DECUS version from the VAX to the PC as shareware. In 1987, Chuck Simmons re-implemented the game in C using the UNIX curses library for its supports of many character-cell terminals. Eric S. Raymond maintains a copy of this version and shared some version with open- source projects.http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5011 In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared the original Empire the 8th-best computer game ever released.  Empire: Wargame of the Century  After this, Bright recoded the game in C on an IBM PC. With low commercial expectations, he submitted an announcement to January 1984 BYTE Magazine's \\"Software Received\\" section, and received a flood of orders. After writing to many software companies (including Br√∏derbund, Sirius Software, Simon & Schuster, subLOGIC, Epyx and MicroProse), he licensed the game to a small software company named Interstel, who hired Mark Baldwin to add a graphical user interface. Starting around 1987, Empire: Wargame of the Century on the Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Apple II, Macintosh and DOS was produced.  Empire Deluxe  In the early 1990s, Mark Baldwin and Bob Rakowsky rewrote the game, calling it Empire Deluxe for DOS, Mac OS, and Windows, released in 1993 with New World Computing as the publisher. Empire Deluxe sustained the old game play of Interstel's version in a standard game, while adding a basic version for beginners, and advanced game with new units such as the Bomber and Armor and maps sizes up to 200x200. An expansion pack, Empire Deluxe Scenarios, was produced later in 1993, including a map and scenario statistics tool, a map randomiser tool (as random maps were present in the Interstel version, but lacking from Empire Deluxe), upgrade patches for both DOS and Windows versions and a collection of 37 scenarios (with accompanying maps) from \\"celebrity\\" designers, many of them famous in the games industry including Will Wright, Jerry Pournelle, Jim Dunnigan, Johnny Wilson (Computer Gaming World editor), Gordon Walton, Don Gilman (Harpoon series architect), Trevor Sorensen (Star Fleet series designer), and the game's authors Mark Baldwin and Bob Rakosky. Computer Gaming World in 1993 called Empire Deluxe \\"a welcome addiction (sic) to the library of every serious strategy gamer\\". A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game four stars out of five, noting flaws but stating that \\"Yet, I keep on playing\\". It enjoyed great success, and was noted as one of Gamespy's Greatest Games of All Time. Empire Deluxe was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #195 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. In 1994, PC Gamer US named Empire Deluxe the 35th best computer game ever. The editors called it \\"an elegant and adaptable game system that [...] allows almost endless replayability.\\" Computer Gaming World in 1993 stated that Empire Deluxe Scenarios offered \\"a lot of value\\" to the game's fans.  Killer Bee Software  In the Winter of 2002, Mark Kinkead of Killer Bee Software purchased the rights for Empire Deluxe from Mark Baldwin and Bob Rakowsky, and in 2003 produced a new version called Empire Deluxe Internet Edition a.k.a. EDIE for Windows. This was essentially a port of the code Baldwin and Rakowsky produced in 1993, with few changes, such as a slightly increased map size (255x255), but did not add any new rules. A year later, Kinkead would create an \\"Enhanced\\" version with new units and rules, including artillery, engineers and orbital units. The company produced several other editions for Windows, Android, and iOS. Sequel In 1995, New World Computing published a sequel named Empire II: The Art of War. While the original had been a turn-based strategy, Empire II was shifted towards turn-based tactics: there was no more empire-building and production of units, but the complexity and realism of battles were enhanced with features such as morale rules and various degrees of damage. The playable campaigns consisted of a collection of diverse historical or fictional battles. The game editor feature was enhanced by allowing the user to design not only new maps and campaigns, but also new units with new graphics and sounds.

It is located approximately south of the town of Stanford-le-Hope in what is now Thurrock unitary authority. Early history Mucking was \\"a particularly extensive Anglo-Saxon settlement, of at least 100+ people, commanding an important strategic position in the Lower Thames region; it may have functioned as a meeting place and mart for surrounding areas on both sides of the Thames\\".Sue Hirst and Dido Clark, Excavations at Mucking: Volume 3, The Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries (Museum of London Archaeology 2009) Its name is of Saxon origin and indicates human settlement here for well over a millennium. The meaning is usually given as 'the family (or followers) of Mucca' (Mucca most likely being a local chieftain). However, Margaret Gelling has suggested alternative interpretations - 'Mucca's place' or 'Mucca's stream'.Margaret Gelling, The Place-name Mucking (in Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2, English Heritage, 1993, page 96) Mucking's geographical location on flat marshland at the very mouth of the River Thames indicates that settlement in the area by Germanic invaders from the continent probably occurred at a relatively early date; indeed, an outline of a now abandoned nearby Saxon village, West Mucking, was discovered from aerial photographs in the 20th century. Mucking was host to a small iron smelting industry because of its workable deposits of iron ore.Tylecote, RF, 1986, The Prehistory of Metallurgy in the British Isles. Institute of Metals London. Spongy iron blooms were produced and had their impurities worked out by a process known as 'Mucking'.Morton, GR, & Brit, R,G.,1974-75 The Present Day Production of Wrought Iron. Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society. It is not known if this process is connected to the village name or a coincidence. Modern Mucking The paddle steamer Crested Eagle passing Mucking Light, by Jack Spurling Although the population of the hamlet is now less than one hundred, it thrived in Victorian times, boasting small shops, a large rectory and the mediaeval church of St John the Baptist (both of the latter buildings have now been converted to private houses, with access to the church graveyard possible only with prior written permission). The hamlet also gives its name to Mucking Flats, the mudflat on the estuary to the east of the village, one of Essex's Sites of Special Scientific Interest and once the site of a small lighthouse. Archaeological excavation Mucking was the location for a major archaeological dig ahead of excavation from the gravel quarry that swallowed it up. The site was discovered by crop marks in the soil photographed by Dr St Joseph in 1959. The excavation was directed by Margaret Jones and lasted from 1965 to 1978. In addition to major finds from the Saxon period, other artefacts from the site span the period from the Stone Age through to the medieval period.M U Jones, Mucking and the early Saxon rural settlement in Essex (in D G Buckley (Editor), Archaeology in Essex to AD 1500) The Saxon settlement excavated at Mucking was extensive with more than 230 buildings. The site contained two cemeteries.Nigel Brown (compiler), Splendid and Permanent Pageants, Essex County Council, 2000 Many of the buildings were sunken huts although there were timber halls which were possibly occupied by the higher status families. The settlement gradually moved north over the course of two hundred years after its establishment in the 4th century. Parish church The parish church was dedicated to St John the Baptist. It was largely demolished and rebuilt in the middle of the 19th century. It is now redundant and used as private dwelling.Andrew Barham, Lost Parish Churches of Essex (Ian Henry Publications, 2000 Mucking Marshes Landfill site Notes External links * Location of Mucking on Streetmap.co.uk * - Photographs of former Mucking church. * - Former Mucking Flat lighthouse * - Mucking Marshes landfill site and its uncertain future * - Details of barge transportation to Mucking Marshes landfill site Category:Hamlets in Essex Category:Former civil parishes in Essex Category:Thurrock ","title":"Mucking"},{"id":"6896336","text":"DƒÉnule≈üti may refer to several villages in Romania: * DƒÉnule≈üti and Muce≈üti- DƒÉnule≈üti, villages in Buda Commune, BuzƒÉu County * DƒÉnule≈üti, a village in Gurasada Commune, Hunedoara County  See also  * DƒÉne»ôti (disambiguation) ","title":"DƒÉnule»ôti"},{"id":"6896341","text":"Dealu Bisericii may refer to several villages in Romania: * Dealu Bisericii, a village in Uda, Arge»ô * Dealu Bisericii, a village in Sine»ôti, V√¢lcea ","title":"Dealu Bisericii"},{"id":"6896342","text":"Plaveck√Ω ≈†tvrtok is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Malacky District in the Bratislava region.

A native of Jiangsu, he entered upon official life as secretary to the Prince of Xin'an. When the Emperor Xiaowu of Liu Song was building a shrine to the memory of his favourite concubine, the Prince's mother, Zhang would only subscribe a hundred cash. This caused the Emperor to say sarcastically that he must be provided with some well-paid post, and to send him to Fengxi () in Annam. Zhang declared at starting that he had no fear as to returning; his only fear was that he might be sent back again. On the road, he fell into the hands of bandits; but when they were about to cut his head off, they found him quietly inditing a poem, at which they were so astonished that they let him go. He managed to reach Hu·∫ø after a long passage, during which he composed a famous poem, called Song of the Sea (), admitted by Xu Kaizhi () to be superior to his own work under the same title. On his return, he was raised to high office, and was subsequently a great favourite with the Emperor Gao of Southern Qi, who said that he could not do without one such man, nor with two. In spite of his exalted rank he dressed so poorly that on one occasion his Majesty sent him an old suit of clothes, with a message that a tailor had been instructed to take his measure for a new one. The Taoist priest Lu Xiujing () also gave him a fan made of white egret feathers, saying that strange things should be given to strange people.

Profile Little Carpathians around the Plaveck√Ω hrad Castle Solo≈°nica lies at the foot of the northwestern side of the Mal√© Karpaty (Little Carpathians) Mountains at an altitude of 291 m above sea level. Southeast of the village is the majestic peak, V√°penn√° (Ro≈°t√∫n National Nature Reserve), rising 748 m sharply up from the lowlands. Beautiful surroundings draw tourists, who admire the cliffs Little and Great V√°pennej as well as the Ro≈°t√∫n State Reservation, located in the cadastral area of Solo≈°nica and Plaveck√© Podhradie. Within this range are the Great V√°pennej and ƒåertova Valley. It was proclaimed in 1953 to encompass 109 ha. A new decree in 1988 amended the boundaries. Today it covers 333.31 ha. It was established to protect the karst phenomena, preserve the forests of the Little Carpathians, and protect endangered species. History The first time Solo≈°nica was mentioned was in 1367. The beginning of its existence is closely connected with an internal colonization at the beginning of the 14th century. Solo≈°nica had several different names throughout the centuries, some of which are Zeleskut, Pratunprun (1367), Zyleskut (1371), Solossnicza (1773) or Sz√©lesk√∫t from the Hungarian language, where sz√©les stands for broad and k√∫t means well (presumably a watering place for grazing cattle). The German name Breitenbrunn (not to be confused with Breitenbrunn, Austria) also corresponds with the similar translation of the parts of this compound word referring to its name (breit means broad and brunn means well or spring). The Hungarian form of the name had the most important impact on forming the Slovak version. The word soƒæ referring to the salt connected to the suffix -nica created the complete Slovak version of the name for the village. There is even a particular area within the village called Slanisko, the word stem of which word is obviously \\"salt or salty\\". Solo≈°nica belonged to the earls from Sv√§t√Ω Jur and Pezinok, earldom of Ser√©dy inhabiting Plaveck√Ω Castle, earldom of Balass and later on to the earldom of Plavec (there were several families and their generations that were changed throughout the years as its owners). From the 17th century on, Plaveck√Ω Castle and the nearby villages had been registered in the ownership of the P√°lfys. According to the charter named \\"Colonia sub montem Rachsturm\\" from 1478, there was a settlement called \\"H√≥lint\\" located under the hill called \\"Ro≈°turm\\" within the area of Solo≈°nica. This settlement was occupied by forest workers of German origin called \\"holchokari. There were about 20 houses made of wood. The settlement went through a little bit of decadence and decline after 1781 when the Patent of Toleration was declared. This document did not allow establishment of an evangelic chapel that would be used for praying and worship in places where there were not at least a hundred evangelic families. Therefore, the majority of the population of this settlement moved either to Solo≈°nica or to Pezinok. There are many of their descendants living in Solo≈°nica even today. In 1828 there were 205 houses and the population of Solo≈°nica was 1484. These people were primarily engaged in agriculture, weaving, furriery, and calcinations which continued until 1950. The production and manufacture of wooden tools was also very popular among people back then and thus has continued into the present. Natural disasters Solo≈°nica has gone through and already witnessed several disasters. In 1857 a huge and disastrous fire broke out. In about half an hour, most of the houses already caught fire because their roofs were made from straw. 12 people died as a result of this terrible fire. There were only six houses and the church left afterwards. In 1861 during the celebrations devoted to the Holy Ghost there was a strong storm with heavy rain which resulted in the level of the Solo≈°nica Stream rising and flooding a substantial part of the village. Lots of inhabitants of Solo≈°nica had a very hard time and suffered a lot during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The Prussian troops were marching from Moravia towards Trnava and there were numerous fights going on. A great number of the dead were not buried which resulted in cholera being spread gradually all around Z√°horie. About 149 people died in Solo≈°nica as a result of being infected with cholera from August 29 to November 14, 1866. In the spring of 1909, there was a severe landslide in the land area called \\"Na Jam√°ch\\" and \\"N√≠≈æiny\\". Another landslide also occurred in 1936. World War I World War I brought along plenty of hardship, suffering, and famine, as well as poverty for the local people. Around 180 men were gradually drafted from Solo≈°nica and they fought on the Serbian front. Some of them were reported missing and 43 men died while fighting on the front. In order to commemorate this significant event, a memorial was built in 1931 by the village with the help of the money collected among its inhabitants. Landmarks There are two important historic landmarks located in the village: *All Saints Church Dates back to the 14th century when it is considered to have originated. The new church was built on the foundations of the old one in 1699. It was dedicated to All Saints' Day. It was built in the baroque style. The church has been reconstructed and undergone various changes until now. The painting comes from the years between 1880-1890. *The sawmill left after Mr. Alexander Nottn√Ω from 1880 In 1720 there was a mill in the village, in the 18th century there was a papermill widely used, in the 19th century a distillery was built and the manorial grange was established.

History   First settlements  Recent discoveries indicate that the first settlements date back to the so-called La T√®ne culture, where the present territory was inhabited by Celtic tribes. They settled here probably as they were able to extract metals from the ores located in the northeast of today's village. Evidence of Celtic settlement was first discovered in 1980 - 1983 by a Slovak archaeologist Dr. Lev Zachar, a member of the Archaeological Institute of the Slovak National Museum, in cooperation with the locals. During this period, 18 locations were discovered, hiding various iron and bronze clips, iron spikes and parts of ceramics, which are now part of the exhibition in the Slovak National Museum.  First written mention and resettlement  The first written mention until recently was thought to be the last part of the three-volume work of Cities and Communities of Slovakia from 1592, where the municipality is registered under its German name Hausbrun. It was previously believed that the town was founded by German- speaking settlers from Austria in the 15th century. Today, however, experts turn to the 1392 documents of Sigismund of Luxembourg, in which the Polish Duke Stibor of Stiboricz was given the Royal Wywar Castle (Hol√≠ƒç), together with all the properties belonging to this castle. Studienka, listed in this charter as the village of Iwanusfalua, belonged to this catchment area as the southernmost village of Holice district. In the 15th century, after the defeat of Kingdom of Hungary (1526‚Äì1867) to the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the area became part of the Habsburg monarchy. This marked the beginning of a new era for the area, as it received a influx of German- speaking population from Austria, resulting in its growth. There are no reliable written references to the reason for the arrival of the German- speaking population, but two versions have been preserved by oral submission. According to one version, the Austrian lumberjacks were supposed to build their houses near a fountain, hence it was called in German Haus bei Brunn (\\"house by the fountain\\"), then Hausbrunn and later Slovak Hasprunka. The second version talks about a shepherd from Hausbrunn (Lower Austria), who was looking for pastures for his flock of sheep. After other shepherds settled in the village, the place was later Slovakized Hasprunka, named after the place of origin of the first shepherd. In 1948, the place was renamed Studienka due to national political reasons (see Slovakization), following the Slovak word studna (\\"fountain\\").  World War I  On July 28, 1914, general mobilization was declared and all eligible men were sent the eastern front. This resulted in only women, children and the elderly remaining in the village. A general chronicle of these years indicates a period of hunger and misery, and in 1915 even church bells were taken for the military purposes. The end of the war and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918 resulted in the outbreak of chaos in the village and subsequently looting, especially of wealthy Jewish population. The total number of victims of the war period is unknown, but 37 men were not returned from the front. The names of the fallen soldiers are engraved on the memorial to the victims of the First World War from 1919, which stands in the park at St Stephen's Church.  Jewish community in the village  By the late 19th and early 20th century, the Jewish community had a strong presence in town. Its members owned pubs, shops, a bakery and a meat shop. Many of them were important members of the general council and municipality. During this period a Synagogue, a Jewish School and a Jewish Cemetery were established. The unfavourable situation before the Second World War forced most of the Jewish population to leave the town. Others who stayed behind were deported to the concentration camps - the last Jewish citizen left the village in 1939. The Jewish Synagogue, is now used as a Municipal office, and the remains of the Jewish cemetery in the town quarter of Na Jame is preserved. * Rabbi Max Reiser was born in 1839 in Studienka.

The first written notice about the village has its origins in the year 1378. The village Veƒæk√© Lev√°re is situated in the reach of these well-known centers: Bratislava, Vienna, and Brno. The village is placed on a historically important trade route; its history is recorded as a settlement of archers and as a border watch post. History There are historically unique and Europe's most preserved buildings of a notable architecture - Haban's houses, there. Other buildings of the village are witnesses of its rich history. The Habans were followers of an ultra- nonconformist Christian doctrine which, among other things, held that believers should be baptised as youths, not as infants - followers are also known as Anabaptists. In the religious turmoil of 16th- and 17th-century Europe this was regarded as heresy and frequently resulted in severe persecution. Several groups left their original homes in Germany, some heading west to North America (where one group became known as the Amish); others went east, some ending up in the village of Veƒæk√© Lev√°re in Z√°horie.http://travel.spectator.sme.sk/articles/1927/vealk_levre Local landowners were keen for them to settle here: they were well-behaved, reliable taxpayers and prodigiously hard workers. Their main occupation was pottery making. Haban designs are very similar to those still used in Modra pottery; indeed it is very likely that this is where the Modra potters got their techniques. The main difference is that Haban designs never use red, which is associated with blood. The Habans were not allowed to settle in the centre of Veƒæk√© Lev√°re, instead forming a compound around a square on the edge of the village with a mill, workshops, church, meeting hall and houses (the word \\"Haban\\" refers to their distinctive homes). Theirs was a culture apart: children were brought up communally; marriage to non-Habans was prohibited and, since the community was small, a board approved marriages to prevent in- breeding. In the 16th century Croatian colonists came. The family Kollonic, whose members had a significant influence in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, owned properties and a castle in the neighboring Austria (the village of Jedenspeigen). During the years 1683‚Äì1685, the Kollonics built a baroque manor house with a belonging English park in the village. Cardinal ≈Ωigmund Kolloniƒç - a Veƒæk√© Lev√°re compatriot and Vienna archbishop built a huge Roman Catholic church in the place of original wooden church during the years 1729‚Äì33 that is a dominant of the village and the surroundings. The church was consecrated to the Virgin Mary's name at the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Christian victory over the Turks during a battle nearby Vienna. A temple of the evangelic church a.c. was built at the end of the 18th century. Flora and fauna There are 36 fish species in the river Rudava that flows through the village territory. In the northern part of Veƒæk√© Lev√°re the national nature reserve Abrod is situated. The border river Morava flows through the western edge of the village territory. The noteworthy nature attract tourists and experts by spots with specific and rare vegetation, bird nest places and beaver dams. Business activities Asparagus plantations of the company Asparagus ltd. are situated in the flat country outside the village. Other business activities in the village are: production of prefabricated building products (Prefabrik√°t, joint stock company), cardboard packaging (Surpack, joint stock company), engineering production (Bleckman, ltd.).

Although not an administrative region, it is one of the 21 official tourism regions in Slovakia. Z√°horie lies in the area of three administrative regions: Bratislava Region (Malacky District plus Z√°horsk√° Bystrica in Bratislava), Trnava Region (Senica and Skalica districts) and Trenƒç√≠n Region (southern part of Myjava District). The region also creates the borders between Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria. A military district of the same name is located around Malacky. Name The word \\"Z√°horie\\" means \\"(The land) behind the mountains\\", referring to the Little Carpathians mountains that separate Z√°horie from the rest of Slovakia. The Hungarian name of Z√°horie, \\"Erd≈ëh√°t\\" translates to \\"(The land) behind the forest\\". Geography In the middle of the region is the Z√°horsk√° n√≠≈æina, a plain between the towns of Senica and Malacky. Most of the area is forested because its sandy subsoil is not suitable for farming. The forested area is used as a testing range for military vehicles, especially tanks and artillery. The testing range is called Vojensk√Ω technick√Ω sk√∫≈°obn√Ω √∫stav Z√°horie (the Z√°horie Military Technical Testing Institute), and it contains the testing range, the Kuchy≈àa airbase and the village of Z√°horie, which was built for workers at the testing range. Headquarters are located in the village of Z√°horie and includes storage facilities and research facilities. The western edge of the region is formed by the river Morava. The eastern border is the Carpathian Mountain Range. On the north is the Chvojnick√° pahorkatina. The Myjava River flows through the region, and nearly every village has a dam or lake. Climate and agriculture The region is a plain behind mountains, so the climate is much drier than that of the rest of Slovakia. The region is well known for its wide yellow fields of rapeseed and red wine. Other grown crops are corn, sunflowers and grain. This region is well known for producing high quality wines, especially in the regions around the town Skalica. This town is well known for a typical cuve√© - Skalicky Rubin (Skalica Carbuncle), a composition of three sorts of red wine - Noir de Franconie (subsort Lampart)+ Portugais Bleu + Saint Laurent (Skalicka Frankovka, Modry Portugal, Sv√§tovavrineck√©) and also a typical subsort of Noir de Franconie redwine - Lampart. The region specific production of alcoholic beverages is typically known with wine brandy and various fruit spirits (pear, apple, plum...) with higher volume of alcohol, 40% and more, especially slivovica, a popular local speciality. Population The population in the area is around 170,000. Towns in the region are Gbely, Hol√≠ƒç, Malacky, Senica, Skalica, Stupava and ≈†a≈°t√≠n-Str√°≈æe. The people here were for many years in the past farmers, so there are no big towns, most of the people lived in small villages not far from each other. The average distances between the villages are less than 3 km. Between the villages are very often small settlements, especially around Myjava and Brezov√° pod Bradlom, called kopanice, osady or samoty. Because the region is geographically separated from the rest of Slovakia, its inhabitants (sg. Z√°hor√°k, pl. Z√°hor√°ci) are culturally closer to the Moravians and speak a distinct dialect of Slovak language that forms dialect continuum with the Moravian dialects of the Czech language. They are a target of frequent region-specific jokes from the rest of Slovaks, in a similar way that e.g. the Irish are mocked by the British, and the people from Appenzell, Switzerland are being laughed at by the rest of the Swiss. Environment and ecology Some parts of Z√°horie are protected by Z√°horie Protected Landscape Area, the first lowland protected landscape area in Slovakia. The Landscape Area takes 275.22 km¬≤ (106.3 mi¬≤) and is divided into two separate parts ‚Äì north-eastern and western. The Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area and Biele Karpaty Protected Landscape Area are partly situated in Z√°horie. The largest part of Z√°horie is taken up by the Z√°horie Lowland, which is divided into the Bor Lowland and the Chvojnica Hills. The Bor Lowland (slovak: Borsk√° n√≠≈æina) is named after a big artificial forest named Bor, which is an old Slavic word (still commonly used in the Czech language) meaning pine forest. This forest was planted with Scots Pine in the 18th century on the largest blown sands of Slovakia. Transportation The importance of Z√°horie for transportation purposes increased sharply after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, owing to the need to connect the two most important cities of the newly formed country, i.e. Prague and Bratislava, with a road and a railway that do not cross into any other country. Before that time, a typical horse carriage journey from Prague to Bratislava would pass through Znojmo and Vienna. As a result, the main railway track passing through Z√°horie (which was originally built in the late 19th century to connect Bratislava with Skalica) was doubled in 1920 and the track layout at the station of K√∫ty was modified so that the direct track from Bratislava now leads over the Morava river to B≈ôeclav. The connection with the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway in B≈ôeclav was rebuilt in 1929 too, so that direct trains between Prague and Bratislava no longer had to reverse direction in B≈ôeclav. The construction of the D2 motorway passing through Z√°horie and connecting Bratislava with Brno and further with Prague was commenced in 1969 and completed in 1980. Nowadays Z√°horie provides the fastest route between Prague and Budapest for both road and rail traffic.

History During the mid-19th century, English companies began mining for gold in the area, mostly in Devala and Pandalur. A London-based mining company created a township in Pandalur that began with a church, post office, shops, and a race course. After the gold boom, the mining business gradually fell into decline because the percentage of gold ore was below the average. Even so, mining was continued until the beginning of the 20th century. Once the British companies had determined that gold mining would not succeed in this area, thus changing to agricultural industries and created tea plantations on a massive scale. The climate and soil were well suited for tea, which helped to ensure the success of the new industry. Coffee and tea plantation started at Pandalur area in the early eighteenth century during this time many European planters settled in the Nilgiris and Wyanad to establish tea and coffee estates. D.H.McLeod and Henry Atzenwiler are few among them. Kunjalikutty Haji of Pandalur was one of the leading manpower suppliers for British estates. Kunalikutty Haji - A family photo 1930 He brought a large number of people from Malabar to work on the estates, and became very close to the British administration, being recognized as Khan Bahadur Kunajalikutty. During this period in India, the non-cooperation movement against the British was in full swing. The Mappila rebels were agitated over the Khilafat issue, and determined to eliminate the people among the community who supported the British Raj. A group of Khilafat rebels went to Pandalur and completely destroyed the shop owned by Kunalikutty Haji, though his life was saved by his friend Malla Gawdar, chief of the Badagas community in Pandalur. Most of the land in this area was the property of the princely states of Nilambur, Kovilagam, and Mysoor Maharaj. The Nelliyalam Rani administered the region for Mysoor Maharaj and enjoyed the highest rank in society. The remains of the Nelliayalam Ranis fort can still be viewed in the Nelliayalam village. Pandalur was believed to be a sacred place for the aboriginal communities such as the Paniyas, Kurumbas, and Kattu Nayakkans. It was then dominated by the Gowdar community. In Ponnani, near the village of Nelliyalkam, there is a century-old temple (Sree Maha Vishnu Temple) constructed in the unique Kerala temple architecture. The migration of Malabar people had a major impact on the area, including the social, cultural, economic, and environmental systems.

It is situated at the junction of U.S. Highway 84 and FM 1047 in east central Mills County, east of Goldthwaite and west of Evant. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The K√∂ppen Climate System describes the weather as humid subtropical, and uses the abbreviation Cfa.Climate Summary for Star, Texas History The community was laid out by Alec Street in the mid-1880s and was named for nearby Star Mountain. A post office was established in 1886 with Calvin Skinner as its first postmaster. In 1890, the first public road opened from Star to Goldthwaite. By 1895, the community had a saloon, several grocery stores, and a drug store. A tornado struck Star on May 5, 1904. Two people were killed and five homes were completely destroyed. The community recovered and a permanent church was built in 1905. In 1910, a bank opened. A four room, two-story stone school building was completed in 1913. A hailstorm damaged homes, businesses, and the school on April 22, 1924. Star's bank was robbed in 1928 and the robber got away with about $3,000 and several valuables. Four years later, during the Great Depression, the bank was sold to the Trent State Bank in Goldthwaite. By 1939, Star had a numerous variety of businesses operating in the community. That same year, three area schools ‚Äì McGirk, Center City, and Hurst Ranch ‚Äì consolidated with Star. The population stood at around 170 in the mid-1940s. The rising popularity of the automobile caused a decline in the number of local businesses. By 1980, the community had an estimated population of 85. That figure remained steady through 2000.

Gameplay Empire is a turn-based 4X wargame, where players command armies of units which they use to explore the game world, control territory, and attack opponents. The game world consists of \\"sectors\\", which may be designated as agricultural, industrial, etc. Control of these sectors grants the player a variety of raw and manufactured materials, which they may use to construct dozens of unit types. In each round, the players submit their commands for the activities of their units to the central server, which executes all of the commands either simultaneously or in a sequence. Rounds can last anywhere from a few hours to a day. As such, a full game can take much longer than modern 4X games, depending on the size of the game world; \\"Blitz\\" games may last a few hours, while typical games last months and larger games can take up to a year to complete.

Between 1972 and 1974, Langston expanded on the game, with additions by Ben Norton, Chuck Douglas, Mike Rainwater, and several others. When the host computer was retired, the original game was lost. Subsequently, two other authors each independently wrote a new version of the game, both named Empire, and several ports of the game were created for other computer systems, such as PSL Empire for the PDP 11/70, and a version with added weather effects for the VAX-11. Langston, now at Harvard University, recreated the game in C, and shared the source code with a few other developers; disliking the changes they made, he stopped doing so, maintaining the canonical version of the game until 1985, when he stopped development. Around that time, he gave the source code to a group including Dave Pare, who was attempting to reverse engineer the game. Pare then adapted the game into a version named UCSD Empire after the University of California at San Diego, and the following year into BSD Empire with several additions such as planes. Numerous other versions were created over the next decade for various computer types, including KSU Empire, Xerox Development Environment (XDE) Empire on Xerox computer workstations, PC Empire by Gordon Storga for DOS, Amiga Empire for the Commodore Amiga, and Wolfpack Empire. In 1984, Ben Norton wrote a version titled Empire Classic in Pascal on an HP3000 and released to the HP3000 Contributed Library, which became the definitive version until the Wolfpack Empire project began in 1996. In 2003, the game was ported to the C++ programming language for the Linux operating system, and a subsequent Java client/server version was produced.

The boundary dispute was inherited from the colonial powers (Spain in the case of Venezuela, and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the case of Guyana) and is complicated by the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom in 1966. The status of the territory is subject to the Geneva Agreement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966) from UN Despite the treaty, Venezuela has used diplomatic, economic and military actions against Guyana, such as threatening economic sanctions against nations seeking to assist Guyana developing the territory. Loss of the resource-rich area, which constitutes about two-thirds of Guyana's territory, would do irreversible damage to the economic development of Guyana. The territory is divided by Guyana into six administrative regions: Barima-Waini, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Potaro-Siparuni, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands-West Demerara. Venezuela often depicts it in the map as a striped region called Guayana Esequiba or Zone in Reclamation () and it is included in the state constitutions of Bol√≠var and Delta Amacuro. History  15th century  The first European encounter of the region was by the ships of Juan de Esquivel, deputy of Don Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus in 1498. The region was named after Esquivel. In 1499, Amerigo Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda explored the mouths of the Orinoco, and allegedly were the first Europeans to explore the Essequibo.  16th century  A 1625 map by Hessel Gerritsz, showing Dutch territory (in yellow) ranging from the Orinoco River to the Amazon River Dutch colonisation of the Guianas occurred primarily between the mouths of the Orinoco River in the west and the Amazon River to the east. Their presence in the Guianas is noted by the late 1500s, though many documents of early Dutch discoveries in the region were destroyed. The Dutch were present as far west as the Araya Peninsula in Venezuela utilizing salt pans in the area. By the 1570s, it was reported that the Dutch were commencing trade in the Guinanas, but little evidence exists. At the time, neither the Portuguese nor the Spanish had made any establishments in the area. A Dutch fort was built in 1596 at the mouth of the Essequibo River on an island, though the fort was destroyed by the Spanish later that year. In 1597, Dutch interest in traveling to the Guianas became common following the publication of The Discovery of Guiana by Sir Walter Raleigh. On 3 December 1597, a Dutch expedition left Brielle and travelled the coasts between the Amazon and Orinoco. The report, written by A. Cabeljau and described as having \\"more realistic information about the region\\" than that of Raleigh, showed how the Dutch had travelled the Orinoco and Caron√≠ River, discovering dozens of rivers and other land previously unknown. Cabeljau wrote of good relations with the natives and that the Spanish were friendly when they encountered them in San Tom√©. By 1598, Dutch ships frequented the Guiana to establish settlements.  17th century  Ruins of Fort Kyk-Over-Al, constructed by the Dutch in 1616 Another Dutch fort supported by indigenous groups was established at the mouth of the Essequibo River in 1613, though this was destroyed by the Spanish in November 1613. In 1616, Dutch ship captain Aert Adriaenszoon Groenewegen established Fort Kyk-Over-Al located down the Essequibo River, where he married the daughter of an indigenous chief, controlling the Dutch colony for nearly fifty years until his death in 1664. By 1637, the Spanish wrote that the Dutch \\"In those three settlements of Amacuro, Essequibo and Berbis the [Dutch] have many people... all the Aruacs and Caribs are allied with him\\", with later reports of the Dutch building forts from Cape North at the Amazon River to the opening of the Orinoco River. In 1639, the Spanish stated that the Dutch in Essequibo \\"were further protected by 10,000 to 12,000 Caribs in the vicinity of which they frequent, and who are their allies\\". Captain Groenewegen was recognized as keeping both the Spanish and Portuguese from settling in the area. In a speeches to the Parliament of England that took place on 21 January 1644, English settlers who had explored the Guianas stated that the Dutch, English and Spanish had long sought to find El Dorado in the region. The English said that the Dutch were experienced with traveling the Orinoco River for many years. Due to their skillful travel of the Dutch on the Orinoco, the Spanish would later encounter the Dutch and prohibit them from traveling the river. Serious Dutch colonization west of the Essequibo began in the early 1650s, while the colony of Pomeroon being established between the Moruka River and Pomeroon River. Many of these colonists were Dutch-Brazilian Jews who had left Pernambuco. In 1673, Dutch settlements were established as far as the Barima River.  18th century  A 1775 map of the Americas by Rigobert Bonne, showing Dutch Guiana spanning from the mouth of the Orinoco River to the Maroni River The Dutch colonies of Essequibo and Demerara in 1798. The Dutch map map recognizes the Barima River near the opening of the Orinoco River as its boundary with the Spanish.By 1745, the Dutch had several territories in the region, including Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice, and Surinam. Dutch settlements were also established on the Cuyuni River, Caron√≠ River and Moruka River. Domingos, Bandeira Jer√≥nimo and Roque described Essequibo and Demerara as \\"sophisticated and promising slave colonies\\". No boundary between the Spanish and Dutch possessions was ever defined.Humphreys, R. A. (1967), \\"Anglo- American Rivalries and the Venezuela Crisis of 1895\\", Presidential Address to the Royal Historical Society 10 December 1966, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 17: pp 131‚Äì164 Dutch slaves in Essequibo and Demerara recognized the Orinoco River as the boundary between Spanish and Dutch Guiana, with slaves often attempting to cross the Orinoco to live with increased, though limited, liberties in Spanish Guiana. The French Encyclop√©die, published in 1757, noted that Spanish Guyana was located between the Orinoco and Essequibo River while Dutch Guyana was located between the Essequibo River and Maroni River.Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond D'Alembert, Charles Marie de la Condamine (1757): \\"Guiane\\" in L'Encyclop√©die, Vol. VII, Page 7:1004 See the original page on Commons and the Transcription from the University of Chicago  19th century  Under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, Dutch colonies of Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo were transferred to the United Kingdom. By this time, the Dutch had defended the territory from the British, French and Spanish for nearly two centuries, often allying with natives in the region who provided intelligence about Spanish incursions and escaped slaves.An 1840 map of Gran Colombia including the Esequibo region.Following the establishment of Gran Colombia in 1819, territorial disputes began between Gran Colombia (later Venezuela) and the British. The British stated that during the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, Spain was involved in the discussions and held no objections to the territories claimed by the British. Britain then said that when Gran Colombia was created in 1819, the new government raised no objections and that Gran Colombia was indebted to Britain for its support during the Venezuelan War of Independence. Finally, when Venezuela was founded in 1830, Britain said that there were no objections to the border at that time. Venezuela stated that in 1822 Jos√© Rafael Revenga, Minister Plenipotentiary of Gran Colombia to Britain, proposed borders with British territories that included Gran Colombia acquiring the Essequibo territory. In 1831, Britain merged the former Dutch territories of Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo into a single colony, British Guiana. Schomburgk Line 1896 map detailing British Guiana and the disputes surrounding the Schomburgk Line Under the aegis of the Royal Geographical Society, the German-born explorer and naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk conducted botanical and geographical exploration of British Guiana in 1835. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the \\"Schomburgk Line\\". The Line gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the Orinoco River.King, Willard L. (2007) Melville Weston Fuller ‚Äì Chief Justice of the United States 1888‚Äì1910, Macmillan. p249 According to Schomburgk, it did not contain all the area that Britain might legitimately claim. There was no official dispute between Britain and Venezuela until the Line was created. Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the Essequibo River. Also in 1844, a British proposal to Venezuela to modify the border to give Venezuela full control of the Orinoco river mouth and adjacent territory was ignored. In 1850 both Britain and Venezuela reached an agreement whereby they accepted not to colonize the disputed territory, although where this territory began and ended was not established. Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the \\"Schomburgk Line\\" published until 1886, which led to later accusations by US President Grover Cleveland that the line had been extended \\"in some mysterious way\\".  Gold discoveries  The dispute went unmentioned for many years until gold was discovered in the region, which disrupted relations between the United Kingdom and Venezuela. In 1876, gold mines inhabited mainly by English-speaking people had been established in the Cuyuni basin, which was Venezuelan territory beyond the Schomburgk line but within the area Schomburgk thought Britain could claim. That year, Venezuela reiterated its claim up to the Essequibo River, to which the British responded with a counterclaim including the entire Cuyuni basin, although this was a paper claim which the British never intended to pursue. On 21 February 1881, Venezuela proposed a frontier line starting from a point one mile to the north of the Moruka River, drawn from there westward to the 60th meridian and running south along that meridian. This would have granted the Barima District to Venezuela. In October 1886 Britain declared the Schomburgk Line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1894, Venezuela appealed to the United States to intervene, citing the Monroe Doctrine as justification. The United States did not want to get involved, only going as far as suggesting the possibility of arbitration. Venezuela Crisis of 1895 Official Map of the United States of Venezuela by L. Robelin 1890, which shows the Venezuelan historical claim to the Essequibo and other disputed territories to the south. The longstanding dispute became a diplomatic crisis in 1895. Venezuela hired William Lindsay Scruggs as its lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Scruggs took up Venezuela's argument that British action violated the Monroe Doctrine. Scruggs used his influence to get the US government to accept this claim and get involved. President Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.Zakaria, Fareed, From Wealth to Power (1999). Princeton University Press. . pp145‚Äì146 British prime minister Lord Salisbury and British ambassador to the US Lord Pauncefote both misjudged the importance the American government placed on the dispute.Gibb, Paul, \\"Unmasterly Inactivity?

Ultimately Britain backed down and tacitly accepted the US right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. This US intervention forced Britain to accept arbitration of the entire disputed territory.http://cartografialaguayanaesequiba.blogspot.com/2014/10/la- evidencia-cartografica-de-los.html Treaty of Washington Punch cartoon after the conclusion of the Tribunal of Arbitration. PEACE AND PLENTY. Lord Salisbury (chuckling). \\"I like arbitration ‚Äî In the PROPER PLACE!\\" The Treaty of Arbitration between the UK and Venezuela was signed in Washington on 2 February 1897. This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that \\"An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana\\". The Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that \\"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela\\". The Treaty also established the rules and principles to be followed by the Tribunal in order to draw the borderline.Treaty of arbitration between Venezuela and Great Britain, signed at Washington and dated the second day of February, 1897 Venezuela argued that Spain‚Äìwhose territory they had acquired‚Äìcontrolled land from the Orinoco River to the Amazon River in present day Brazil. Spain, according to Venezuela, only designated its claimed Guiana territory to the Dutch, which did not include much land within the disputed territory. Meanwhile, Britain, who had acquired the Dutch territory, stated that the disputed Guiana region was not Spanish because it was so remote and uncontrolled, explaining that the original natives in the land had shared the territory's land with the Dutch instead of the Spanish and were thus under Dutch and British influence. The rival claims were presented to a tribunal of five arbitrators: two from Britain, two from the US (representing Venezuela's interest) and one from Russia, who were presumed neutral. Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the Mazaruni River, and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. On 3 October 1899 the Tribunal ruled largely in favour of Britain. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. One deviation was that Venezuela received Barima Point at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.King (2007:260) The Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.Globalsecurity.org, \\"Venezuela ‚Äì Guyana Relations\\"Map of Guyana, showing the Essequibo River and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin. Venezuela claims territory up to the western bank of the river. The historical claim by the UK included the river basin well into current-day Venezuela.  Immediate reactions  In 1899, immediately after the arbitration ruling, the US counsel for Venezuela were interviewed jointly, and pointed out their first claims against the ruling: > \\"Great Britain, up to the time of the intervention of the United States, > distinctly refused to arbitrate any portion of the territory east of the > Schomburgk line, alleging that its title was unassailable. This territory > included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value > strategically and commercially. The award gives Point Barima, with a strip > of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control > of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also > awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators > concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be > unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today > had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to > it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much > intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that > the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the > British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; > if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There > was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle > involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where > it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it > could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that > arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in > compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but > was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be > because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the > possession of even more territory\\".\\"Venezuelan Award: the decision of the > Commission regarded as a Compromise\\", in Saint John Daily Sun, Canada. > October 4, 1899. p. 8 The Venezuelan government showed almost immediate disapproval with the 1899 Arbitral Award. As early as 7 October 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jos√© Andrade stated that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela.Kissler, Betty Jane, Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899‚Äì1966, University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions, Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43  20th century   Renewed dispute  On 26 October 1899 in a letter to a colleague, Severo Mallet-Prevost, the Official Secretary of the US‚ÄìVenezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, Friedrich Martens. After numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince the UK of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945. In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death. Mallet-Prevost surmised from the private behavior of the judges that there had a political deal between Russia and Britain,Schoenrich, Otto, \\"The Venezuela-British Guiana Boundary Dispute\\", July 1949, American Journal of International Law. Vol. 43, No. 3. p. 523. Washington, DC. (USA). and said that the Russian chair of the panel, Friedrich Martens, had visited Britain with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3 to 2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory. This memorandum provided a motive for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.Isidro Morales Pa√∫l, An√°lisis Cr√≠tico del Problema Fronterizo \\"Venezuela-Gran Breta√±a\\", in La Reclamaci√≥n Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Econ√≥micas y Sociales. Caracas, 2000, p. 200.de Rituerto, Ricardo M. Venezuela reanuda su reclamaci√≥n sobre el Esequibo, El Pa√≠s, Madrid, 1982. By the 1950s, Venezuelan media led grassroots movements demanding the acquisition of Guayana Esequiba. Under the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, the Venezuelan government began plans to invade Guayana Esequiba. President P√©rez Jim√©nez anticipated the invasion of Guyana in 1958, but was ultimately overthrown in the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat before this was finalized.  United Nations General Assembly complaint  In 1962, Venezuela renewed the territorial dispute. On 12 November 1962, Venezuelan foreign minister gave an exposition in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to denounce the 1899 Paris Tribunal Arbitration, whose ruling was favorable to the United Kingdom, citing the . Brice√±o argued that collusion and nullity vices led to the favorable ruling, and his exposition he stressed that Venezuela considered the Paris Arbitration as null and void because to \\"acts contrary to good faith\\" of the British government and the Tribunal members. Said complaints led to the 1966 Geneva Agreement. Venezuela also cited as several improprieties and vices in the ruling, especially Ultra Vires, due to the fact that the referees drew the border between British Guiana, Brazil and Suriname, and also decreed freedom of navigation in the Amacuro and Barima rivers, exceeding the scope of powers granted by the arbitration treaty in 1897. The Venezuelan claim of the nullity of the 1899 ruling has been acknowledged by several foreign scholars and jurists, such as J. Gillis Wetter of Sweden, in his work The International Arbitral Process (1979), awarded by the American Society of International Law. By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided further evidence of the deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious procedural and substantive defects, evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. Uruguayan jurist Eduardo Jim√©nez de Ar√©chaga, former President of the International Court of Justice, came to similar conclusions. Geneva Agreement At a meeting in Geneva on 17 February 1966, the governments of British Guiana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela signed the \\"Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana\\", best known thereafter as the Geneva Agreement (1966). This agreement established the regulatory framework to be followed by the parties in order to resolve the issue. According to the agreement a Mixed Commission was installed with the purpose of seeking satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the border controversy,Treaty of Geneva 1966, Document Retrieval, UN Department of Political Affairs but the parties never agreed to implement a solution within this Commission due to different interpretations of the agreement. *Guyana argued that prior to starting the negotiations over the border issue, Venezuela should prove that the Arbitral Award of 1899 was null and void. Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. *Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find \\"a practical and satisfactory solution\\", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the agreement would be meaningless. The fifth article of the Geneva Agreement established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force \\"shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty\\". The agreement also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels. In its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated: > Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located > on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before > the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly > reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on > the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo > territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, > limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of > the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the > Atlantic Ocean. Annexation of Ankoko Island Five months after Guyana's independence from the United Kingdom, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of Ankoko Island in October 1966. Venezuelan troops quickly constructed military installations and an airstrip. Subsequently, on the morning of the 14 October 1966, Forbes Burnham, as Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs of Guyana, dispatched a protest to the Foreign Minister of Venezuela, Ignacio Iribarren Borges, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Venezuelan troops and the removal of installations they had established. Venezuelan minister Ignacio Iribarren Borges replied stating \\"the Government of Venezuela rejects the aforementioned protest, because Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory in its entirety and the Republic of Venezuela has always been in possession of it\\". Modern Venezuelan news outlet La Patilla stated in 2011 that Venezuelan president Ra√∫l Leoni's response \\"was of such forcefulness, that until today Anacoco Island is Venezuelan territory and from that moment operates a Venezuelan airport and a military base there\\". Rupununi Uprising Venezuelan president Ra√∫l Leoni made several territorial disputes against Guyana, claiming land for Venezuela. At the time, Venezuela used diplomatic, economic and military pressure against Guyana in order to acquire the Essequibo territory. Venezuelan actions to acquire Guyanese territory intensified in 1968, with militarization occurring on the Guyana-Venezuela border at the time. Days after leaving a subcommittee discussing Guyana- Venezuela border disputes on 4 July 1968, President Leoni declared an annexation of of coastline in the Essequibo on 9 July 1968, stating that the Venezuelan Navy would enforce the area. Following the controversial 1968 Guyanese general election, Valerie Hart declared herself president of the \\"Republic of the Rupununi\\", claiming control of the Rupununi region of Guyana. The rebels were primarily wealthy ranch owners of European descent that were supported by Amerindians, who were mainly ranch employees. Venezuela ultimately supported and sponsored the Rupununi rebels and their secession movement. According to Gonz√°lez, Venezuelan president Ra√∫l Leoni supported the uprising during the final months of his presidency, writing that Leoni \\"undoubtedly inspired and encouraged\\" the Rupununi Uprising. In an effort to receive support from Venezuela, Hart and her rebels stated that they would grant Venezuela control of Guyana's disputed Guayana Esequiba territory in exchange for assistance. On 2 January 1969, rebels flew in a Douglas C-47 Skytrain operated by Venezuelan personnel to Pirara, Guyana, north of Lethem, the main city of the Rupununi region. Valerie Hart, the rebel leader, flew to Caracas aboard the Douglas C-47 Skytrain's returning flight. Rebels began their attacks on Lethem in the morning, killing five police officers and two civilians while also destroying buildings belonging to the Guyanese government with bazooka fire. The rebels locked citizens in their homes and blocked airfields in Lethem, Annai Good Hope, Karanambo and Karasabai, attempting to block staging areas for Guyanese troops. As the Guyana Defence Force approached Lethem, the rebels quickly fled and the uprising ended. About thirty of the rebels were arrested following the uprising. Members of the failed uprising fled to Venezuela for protection after their planned unravelled, with Hart and her rebels being granted Venezuelan citizenship by birth since, according to the Venezuelan government, they were recognized as being born in what Venezuela described as \\"the Reclamation Zone\\". At a press conference in Caracas on 8 January 1969, Hart, speaking through Venezuelan government-provided interpreters, stated \\"If Venezuela does not intervene right now with troops they would have in their hands a situation similar to the Bay of Pigs\\". The Guyanese government sent a letter to Venezuela on 8 January 1969. The letter condemned the \\"hypocrisy\\" of the Venezuelan government for attempting to \\"interfere\\" in Guyanese affairs, expressing \\"disgust\\" at Venezuela's acts to \\"advance its spurious territorial claim under the cover of subversion and terrorism\\". Venezuelan Minister of Internal Affairs Reinaldo Leandro Mora admitted publicly that Guyanese individuals received military training in Venezuela under the direction of their parents. When it was apparent that the uprising movement had failed, the Venezuelan government refused to further assist with the uprising and all support ended with the inauguration of Rafael Caldera on 11 March 1969. In his final address to the Congress of Venezuela, President Leoni criticized the Government of Guyana for \\"cruelly smashing\\" the rebels. After the uprising, Venezuela President Rafael Caldera and Burnham were concerned with the reclamation of Guayana Esequiba. Their concern led to the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970. Port of Spain Protocol In 1970, after the expiration of the Mixed Commission established according to the Geneva Agreement, Presidents Rafael Caldera and Forbes Burnham signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of Guayana Esequiba, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. The protocol was formally signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela Aristides Calvani, Guyana State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shridath Ramphal and British High Commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago Roland Hunte.Milutin Tomanoviƒá (1971) Hronika meƒëunarodnih dogaƒëaja 1970, Institute of International Politics and Economics: Belgrade, p. 2512 (in Serbo-Croatian) Parliament of Guyana voted for the agreement on 22 June 1970 with only People's Progressive Party voting against believing that the United Nations should resolve the matter. MPs from almost all parties in the Parliament of Venezuela voiced their sharp criticism of the agreement. Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \\"Zone in Reclamation\\".Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. \\"The Trail of Diplomacy ‚Äì A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue\\" In 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President Luis Herrera Campins decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory. Since then, the contacts between Venezuela and Guyana within the provisions of the Treaty of Geneva are under the recommendations of a UN Secretary General's representative, who can be changed from time to time under agreement by both parties. Diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative continue, but there have been some clashes. The Norwegian Dag Nylander appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres. It was stated that if by December 2017 the UN understood that there was no \\"significant progress\\" in resolving the dispute, Guterres would refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly requested it not to do so. In January 2018, the UN referred the case. 21st century  Ch√°vez administration  President Hugo Ch√°vez eased border tensions with Guyana under advice of his mentor Fidel Castro. In 2004, Ch√°vez said during a visit in Georgetown, Guyana that he considered the dispute to be finished.Map of Venezuela, showing the maritime areas in blue and Guayana Esequiba in gray. In September 2011, Guyana made an application before the United Nations' Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in order to extend its continental shelf by a further . Since the Commission requests that the areas to be considered cannot be subject to any kind of territorial disputes, the Guyanese application disregarded the Venezuelan claim over Guayana Esequiba, by saying that \\"there are no disputes in the region relevant to this submission of data and information relating to the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond .\\" Venezuela sent an objection to the Commission, rejecting the Guyanese application and warning that Guyana had proposed a limit for its continental shelf including \\"the territory west of the Essequibo river, which is the subject of a territorial sovereignty dispute under the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and, within this framework, a matter for the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations\\". Venezuela also said that Guyana consulted its neighbors Barbados, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago before making the application, but did not do the same with Venezuela. \\"Such a lack of consultation with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, serious in itself in that it violates the relevant rules, is inexplicable in so far as the coast whose projection is used by the Republic of Guyana in its attempt to extend the limits forms part of the disputed territory over which Venezuela demands and reiterates its claim to sovereignty rights\\", said the Venezuelan communiqu√©.  Oil discovery in Guyana  On 10 October 2013, the Venezuelan Navy detained an oil exploration vessel conducting seafloor surveys on behalf of the government of Guyana. The ship and its crew were escorted to the Venezuelan Margarita Island to be prosecuted. The Guyanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the vessel was in Guyanese waters, but its Venezuelan counterpart sent a diplomatic note to Guyana stating that the ship was conducting oil research in Venezuelan waters with no authorization from the country, and demanded an explanation. The vessel, Teknik Perdana, together with its crew, was released the next week, but its captain was charged with violating the Venezuelan exclusive economic zone. Despite diplomatic protests from Venezuela, the government of Guyana awarded the American oil corporation Exxon a license to drill for oil in the disputed maritime area in early 2015. In May the government of Guyana announced that Exxon had indeed found promising results in their first round of drilling on the so-called Stabroek Block, an area offshore the Guayana Esequiba territory with a size of . The company announced that further drillings would take place in the coming months to better evaluate the potential of the oil field. Venezuela responded to the declaration with a decree issued on 27 May 2015, including the maritime area in dispute in its national marine protection sphere, thus extending the area that the Venezuelan Navy controls into the disputed area. This in turn caused the government of Guyana to summon the Venezuelan ambassador for further explanation. The tensions have further intensified since and Guyana withdrew the operating license of Conviasa, the Venezuelan national airline, stranding a plane and passengers in Georgetown.  International Court of Justice  In 2018, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres concluded that the Good Offices Process had not determined a peaceful conclusion. Guterres chose to have the controversy settled by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether the 1899 award was valid. On 29 March, Guyana introduced a request in the ICJ to solve the territorial dispute. Venezuela proposed Guyana to restore the diplomatic contacts to attempt to find a solution regarding the territorial dispute, arguing that Guterres \\"exceeded the competences given to him as the Good Offices Figure\\" and that the decision \\"contravenes the spirit, purpose and reason of the Geneva Agreement\\". The Venezuelan government also stated that it did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Court as mandatory. On 19 June, Guyana announced that it would ask the Court to rule on their favor citing Article 53 of the ICJ Estatute, which establishes that \\"if any of the two parties does not show at the tribunal or fails to defend their case, the other party has the right to communicate with the court and to rule in favor of their claim\\". In July 2018, the government of Nicol√°s Maduro argued that the ICJ did not hold jurisdiction over the dispute and said that Venezuela would not participate in the proceedings. The Court stated that Guyana would have until 19 November to present their arguments and Venezuela would have until 18 April 2019 to present their counter arguments. During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, disputed acting president Juan Guaid√≥ and the pro-opposition National Assembly of Venezuela renewed territory disputes with Guyana regarding sovereignty. The oral audiences were planned to take place from 23 to 27 March 2020, where the ICJ would determine if they held jurisdiction in the dispute, however this was delayed indefinitely due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Venezuela did not take part in the hearings which were rescheduled for 30 June.

When Nicholas abdicated the throne in March 1917 Gibbes voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family into exile to the Siberian city of Tobolsk. After the family was murdered in 1918 Gibbes returned to the United Kingdom and eventually became an Orthodox monk, adopting the name of Nicholas in commemoration of Nicholas II. He died in 1963, and is buried at Headington cemetery, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England. Biography Charles Sydney Gibbes was born in Rotherham, Yorkshire, England on 19 January 1876. He was the youngest surviving son of John Gibbs, a bank manager, and Mary Ann Elizabeth Fisher, the daughter of a watchmaker. The fate of a younger son often being to enter the church, at the behest of his father, he took the Moral Sciences Tripos at St John's College, Cambridge, gaining a BA in 1899. Whilst at The University of Cambridge, Charles Sydney added the 'e' to the spelling of his own name. He entered upon theological studies in Cambridge and Salisbury in preparation for holy orders but realised that he had no religious vocation. Sydney is described as: severe, stiff, self-restrained, imperturbable, quiet, gentlemanly, cultured, pleasant, practical, brave, loyal, honourable, reliable, impeccably clean, with high character, of good sense and with agreeable manners. He could also be stubborn, use corporal punishment freely, that he could be very awkward with others, and he is recorded as having quite a temper, at least in his younger years.\\"The Vision of Mr Gibbes\\", Orthodox England Having some talent at languages, he decided to teach English abroad. In 1901 he went to Saint Petersburg, Russia, as tutor to the Shidlovsky family and then the Soukanoff family. He was then appointed to the staff of the Imperial School of Law, and by 1907 he was qualified as vice-president and committee member of the Saint Petersburg Guild of English Teachers. He came to the attention of the Empress Alexandra and in 1908 was invited as a tutor to improve the accents of the Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana; and subsequently Maria and Anastasia. In 1913 he became tutor to Tsarevich Alexei. The children referred to him as Sydney Ivanovich. Gibbes' career as court tutor continued until the February Revolution of 1917, after which the Imperial family was imprisoned in Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo. He was in Saint Petersburg at the time, and immediately after returning to Tsarskoe Selo was proscribed from seeing the family, only being allowed to recover his possessions after the family was transported to the house of the Governor-General of Tobolsk in Siberia. Gibbes voluntarily accompanied the family, arriving in the village in October 1917 shortly before the Provisional Government fell to the Bolsheviks. In May 1918 the Imperial family was moved to the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, and neither Gibbes; French tutor Pierre Gilliard; nor most other servants were allowed to enter. The servants stayed in the railway carriage which had brought them to the city. This carriage became part of a refugee train on 3 June and the tutors were in Tyumen but returned to Yekaterinburg after the murder of the Imperial family on the night of 16/17 July 1918 and the fall of the city to the White Army on 25 July. Gibbes and Gilliard were early visitors to the scene of the executions at the Ipatiev House and were both involved in the subsequent enquiries carried out by Ivan Alexandrovich Sergeiev and by Nicholas Alexievich Sokolov. As the Bolsheviks took Perm and closed in on Yekaterinburg, enquiries were abandoned and Gibbes and Gilliard left for Omsk. Gibbes was appointed as a secretary to the British High Commission in Siberia in January 1919, retreating eastwards as Siberia was captured by the Red Army. He was briefly employed at the British Embassy in Beijing and then became an assistant in the Chinese Maritime Customs in Manchuria. There was a large White Russian refugee community in Harbin and it was there in 1922 that he met an orphan, Georges Paveliev, whom he adopted. He established George in 1934 on a fruit farm at Stourmouth House in East Stourmouth in Kent. Return to England and conversion to Orthodoxy Gibbes returned to England in 1928 and enrolled as an ordinand at St Stephen's House, Oxford, but again decided that ordination in the Church of England was not to be his vocation. In Harbin, China on 25 April 1934 he was received into the Orthodox church by Archbishop Nestor (Anisimov) of Kamchatka and Petropavlovsk who was there in exile.Serfes, Nektarios. Review of An Englishman In The Court Of The Tsar: The Spiritual Journey Of Charles Sydney Gibbes, by Christine Benagh Gibbes took the baptismal name of Alexei in honour of the former Tsarevich. He was tonsured monk on 15 December, ordained deacon on 19 December and priest on 23 December, taking the name Nicholas in honour of the former Tsar. In March 1935 he became an Abbot. He again returned to England in 1937 and was established in a parish in London. At the time of the Blitz he moved to Oxford where in 1941 he established an Orthodox chapel in Bartlemas. In 1949 he bought a house at 4 Marston Street, subsequently known as the Saint Nicholas House. The house was built circa 1890 by a charity founded to distribute free medicine to the poor. During the war the building became the central 'Air Raid Protection' telephone exchange and there is still a 'bomb proof' concrete partition between the ground and first floor. Gibbes kept a chapel dedicated to St Nicholas the Wonderworker within the property. This chapel was home to several icons and mementos of the Imperial family which he brought with him from Yekaterinburg, including a chandelier from the Ipatiev House. The house was divided into flats in the 1960s, and the chapel was converted into a flat in the late 1980s. Death Gibbes died at St Pancras Hospital, London, on 24 March 1963. His open coffin was displayed in the cellar (or crypt) of Saint Nicholas House before his funeral. He is buried in Headington cemetery, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England. His collection of Russian possessions were left with his adopted son, George, in Oxford, and George subsequently donated them to the museum at Luton Hoo. A small chapel was built there to house these memorabilia, consecrated by Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh. The museum has been moved from Luton Hoo and is now a part of the Wernher Collection in Greenwich.

At the first stage of its activity the radio was using broadcasting and studio equipment lent by RFI. The transmitter was set on the top floor of Hotel Marriott. At night, the programme of RFI in French was relayed - it was switched on and off manually. During the first days of broadcasting engineer Leszek Michniewicz (a contributor to Third Program of Polish Radio at that time) offered technical help. Soon the technical servicing was taken over by Micha≈Ç Silski and Andrzej Kijanowski.

In addition to Magnolia, the district also serves the town of Stagecoach and the community of Pinehurst. For the 2018‚Äì19 school year, the district received a score of 87 out of 100 from the Texas Education Agency. History The four earliest schools in the Magnolia area began between 1886‚Äì1889 and were known as the \\"Methodist school,\\" the \\"Grange School,\\" the \\"Baptist school,\\" and the \\"Steger School.\\" These schools were combined together in 1893 under the Grange School name. In the early 1900s, Common School District #6 was created to oversee the education of students in the area. A new building was constructed to serve as the area school, opening its doors in January 1912. The building was burnt in a September 1926 fire, but was rebuilt in 1927. A new brick structure was built to replace the previous school, opening in 1936. Due to segregation, African American high school students during this period were sent to school in Montgomery, while students up to grade 7 attended one of two black schools. In 1939, African American students up to grade 7 were moved into a new building, the George W. Carver School. In 1947, taxpayers approved a bond to construct a school for junior high and high school white students, converting the previous school into an elementary campus. On March 20, 1950, the community voted to convert the Magnolia Common District #6 into Magnolia Independent School District. Beginning in 1957, the Carver school began teaching high school African American students, adding one grade level per year to reduce the number of students transported to Montgomery. In accordance with nation-wide desegregation, the district in 1965 offered students the option to transfer schools. Since no students or teachers voluntarily transferred, the district moved two Carver School teachers to the white elementary campus in order to comply with federal law. In 1967, Magnolia ISD schools were fully desegregated, with the Carver School converted into an intermediate level campus. Beginning in the 1970s, the construction of The Woodlands accelerated population growth in Magnolia ISD's attendance area. The district built the current Magnolia Elementary School campus in 1970‚Äì1971 and built a new high school building in 1976. In 1982, the district built Bear Branch Elementary school on the eastern edge of the district, followed by Lyon Elementary in 1993 and Bear Branch Junior High School in 1996. Population growth accelerated in the 2000s, spurring the construction of several new campuses, including 4 elementary schools, 2 sixth grade campuses, the relocation of Bear Branch Elementary and Magnolia Junior High, the construction of the current Magnolia High School campus in 2001 and Magnolia West High School in 2006.

He is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Carlos Machado. Background Lutter was born and raised in Gann Valley, South Dakota in a farmer family of seven. He began wrestling when he was 12 years old, continuing through high school where he earned All-State honors and then also competed during his first two years attending Northern State University, where he majored in criminal justice. Lutter had originally begun training in Muay Thai, before viewing an early UFC event dominated by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu specialist, Royce Gracie. Lutter then moved to Dallas, Texas and began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Mixed martial arts career The Ultimate Fighter With this victory, Lutter became the challenger for Anderson Silva's Middleweight title. Lutter dedicated his victory on November 11 to the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization dedicated to support wounded U.S. servicemen. Title shot On the day of the weigh-in, one day before the February 3, 2007 bout at UFC 67, Lutter failed to make weight. He weighed-in at 187 pounds on the first attempt, and 186.5 two hours later on his second attempt. Because of his failure to meet the required 185 pounds, his match with Silva was changed to a three-round, non-title bout. This upset many fans, and he was booed upon his entrance into the octagon. Lutter would go on to lose in the second round via submission due to a triangle choke. After TUF Lutter was scheduled to return to the UFC at UFC 74 on August 25, 2007 against UFC newcomer Ryan Jensen; however he was forced to withdraw from the event due to a neck injury. After over a year's absence from the UFC, Lutter was next matched against former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin at UFC 83. After nearly catching Franklin with an armbar in the first round, Lutter was defeated by Franklin in the second round by TKO. After losing two consecutive bouts, Lutter was released from his UFC contract. This makes him the first Ultimate Fighter winner to be released from UFC contract. He defeated Jason \\"The Athlete\\" MacDonald in the main event of Maximum Fighting Championship 22 on October 2, 2009. Lutter's next bout occurred on May 21, 2010, against Rafael Natal. This bout was part of the Moosin: God of Martial Arts show in Worcester, Massachusetts. After 2 take down attempts Lutter was noticeably tired, he lost by knockout in the first round. Retirement Due to the extensive neck injury sustained in the Natal fight and the subsequent long layoff from fighting resulted in Lutter's retirement from professional mixed martial arts competition. Secretly hoping to make it back to the UFC, Lutter did not publicly announce his retirement until a 2019 blog post.

Biography Youth and early career Pareja was born in Lima in 1813, the son of Brigadier Jos√© Antonio Pareja (1757‚Äì1813) and Josepha Septien. After the independence of Peru (1821), his family returned to Spain and he joined the Spanish navy. He made the corresponding ships of his class and traveled almost the entire planet, arriving in one of them to the Philippines. In 1831 he made the instructional cruise aboard the frigate Perla, which was at that time the midshipman school ship. The Chincha Islands War Pareja was sent to the Pacific in 1864 to relieve Admiral Luis Hern√°ndez-Pinz√≥n √Ålvarez, whose seizure of the Chincha Islands was disapproved in Madrid. On January 27, 1865, he signed the Vivanco-Pareja Treaty which was considered derogatory to Peruvian national honor. A general uprising followed in Peru and the government of General Juan Antonio Pezet fell on July 7, 1865. After Chile, in support of Peru, had refused to sell supplies to the Spanish fleet, Pareja went with his fleet to Valparaiso on September 17, 1865 and demanded a public apology. As his demands for satisfaction were refused, he declared war against Chile on the 24th, and proceeded to blockade the principal Chilean ports. During the last weeks of his life, he suffered a series of setbacks in his handling of the War. On November 17 an armed launch of the frigate Resolution was captured by the Allied steamer Independencia near the port of Talcahuano. He could make no positive advances in his war with Chile, his blockade deteriorated, became ineffective and the crews of the ships became demoralized. The proud Admiral was unaware that on November 26 the Chileans had captured the Spanish schooner Virgen de Covadonga, along with the Admiral's correspondence, at the Naval Battle of Papudo and that during the fight the Spaniards had 4 men dead and 21 wounded. When on November 27 the American Consul casually mentioned it, the Admiral suffered a nervous collapse. It was too much for him. The Covadonga was the second warship lost by Spain (after the loss of the Triunfo) in enemy waters. The next day, November 28, Admiral Pareja dressed in his best uniform, laid down on his bed, and shot himself in the head on board his flagship, the Villa de Madrid, in front of Valparaiso. In his testament, he requested not to be buried in Chilean waters; accordingly, he was buried on the high seas.

It was established on June 19, 1902 and it is considered as one of the oldest national secondary schools in the country. History On January 21, 1901, Act No. 74 of the Philippine Commission called for the organization of Public Schools in the Philippines. The Provincial Board, then authorized by Act No. 372 were to establish secondary schools. The first campus was located at the Isthmus of Rosario, in the town of San Roque where Garita Elementary School now stands. Hon. Mariano Trias, then Governor of Cavite, suggested that a High School be established in Cavite, San Roque or Caridad. The school was established on June 19, 1902 with 25 students mostly from the towns of Cavite, San Roque and Caridad. However, classes could not start because of cholera, the buildings in bad condition, there were no desks, and building was unsanitary because it was used as a pig pen. Then Principal Sydney K. Michelle and Mr. Hammond H. Buck raised 100 pesos for the needed repairs. On July 1, 1902, the school became operational with 30 students. On September 1, it became 61 and in November, it became 80. In 1903, Cavite High School transferred to an old but spacious disputed government land where a Spanish hospital stands. Student population continued to increase and during the same year, a debating society was organized among the advanced students. Also, in 1904 and in 1905 respectively, a baseball team and a track and field team was established. The Supreme Court however ordered that the land be returned to the Catholic Church. Again, the school had to relocate at P. Gomez st. where the Spanish Provincial Governor used to reside. In 1908, the High School saw its first five graduates, four males and one female. In 1928, the school had to move to Caridad Preparatory before transferring to its present lot, a sprawling 6-hectare lot located donated by Caridad Estate of Cavite, Inc. through Mr. Hammond Buck who was engaged in the Bureau of Education prior to being engaged in real estate. The 2-2 Plan, the new curriculum, was implemented in 1957 under the then Principal Jose T. Bernal. Back then, Junior and Senior High School students were given the choice whether they preferred vocational, college preparatory or an elective curriculum. Junior students were often sent to Cavite Naval Operating Base (now Cavite Naval Base) for their on-the-job training. They could choose mechanical repairs, machinery operations, practical electricity, welding, sheetmetal, shipfitter, pipefitter or foundry. Boys underwent woodworking courses which were done in the school shop while girls underwent hair science and dressmaking and design courses in the Home Economics Laboratory. Republic Act No. 3694 converted Cavite High School into Cavite National High School as approved by President Diosdado Macapagal on June 22, 1963. The budget appropriated for such purpose was P250,000.00. In school year 1973‚Äì1974, student population was 5,959 while there were 207 teachers and employees. The school admits more than 1,500 new freshmen students from elementary schools in the city as well as in neighboring towns. The present student population is almost 7,000 and there are more than 500 in the school's annex, Cavite National High School ‚Äì Annex (Now Sangley Point National High School).

The village of roughly 1650 people is located next to Kapln√°, east of Pezinok and south-west of Trnava. History The first written reference to the town comes from 1244. However, it is assumed that for the three hundred years before that B√°ho≈à was owned by the Hungarian kings, attached to the Bratislava Castle estate. In the middle of the 16th century the town has experienced an influx of German colonists, who soon became dominant. Their dominance was defused half a century later when Croatian colonists moved in. The town became fully Slovak after the 1918 founding of Czechoslovakia. In 1580, the ruling Jazernick√Ω family built a mansion, which was expanded and rebuilt in 1759-1765. The manor was rebuilt again in 1816 in Neoclassical style. The final renovation came in 1935-1936. In 1845, the horse railway that connected Trnava with Bratislava opened, with a stop in B√°ho≈à. This has positively impacted the town's social and industrial development. After the regular rail line between ≈Ωilina and Bratislava opened, B√°ho≈à retained its train station. Between 1914 and 1921 the Roman Catholic church of Saint Francis of Assisi was built by the famous architect Milan Michal Harminc. In 1930, the manor has become the home of a care home for the blind, and after World War II an electrical manufacturing facility customized for blind workers was opened. Between 1974 and 1990, B√°ho≈à was much larger than it is today, as it also included the villages of Kaplna and Igram. Economy and Infrastructure The village is best known for its vineyards. It lies on the \\"Low Carpathian Mountains Vine Route\\", a tourist-oriented wine tasting route that connects all major wine producing towns in the region. B√°ho≈à has nine shops, five pubs and restaurants and multiple small businesses focusing primarily on basic materials processing, such as stone masoning, carpentry and metal smithing. The town also has a medical center and a dentist, as well as a school and kindergarten. In addition, it has a post office, public water and gas grid, and a sewage system connected to a sewage plant. This level of infrastructure is considered well developed, compared to neighboring villages. Culture and Entertainment The local church features a boy choir. There is a library, and the Town Hall publishes a quarterly newsletter. B√°ho≈à also has a soccer team, which plays in Slovakia's lowest, Sixth Division soccer league. In addition, there is a public pool, tennis courts and a Judo training class. Demographics As of 2004, B√°ho≈à had 1615 inhabitants: 821 males and 794 females. 96.2% were of Slovak ethnicity, 0.9% Hungarians, and the rest was spread among Czech, Gypsy, Ukrainian and German ethnicities. 89.6% of people were Roman Catholic, 1.5% Evangelical Catholic and 6.3% atheist. Of the 408 houses in the village 349 were permanently occupied.

He first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2006. The character was initially portrayed by actor Ben Thompson from his introduction until 8 October 2010, when the character was written out of the serial. Ryan was created by series producer Steve Frost as part of the Connor family. The character was reintroduced in 2012, with the role recast to actor Sol Heras. Heras quit the role in July 2013 and Ryan departed on 2 October 2013. Ryan's return was confirmed in February 2018 and he returned on 23 May 2018, with Ryan Prescott recast in the role. Ryan's storylines include discovering that Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) is not his biological mother, his relationships with Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson), Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) and Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon), becoming a drug abuser, feuds with his brother Ali Neeson (Dario Coates/James Burrows), along with fellow residents Vinnie Powers (Ian Dunn), Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), and Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien); encouraging his own girlfriend Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) to take drugs; being in debt to drug lord Ronan Truman (Alan McKenna) that results in the character being run over by the latter; and getting beat up by local builder Gary Windass (Mikey North) after unwittingly getting involved in his loan-sharking empire. He has since started a relationship with Alya Nazir (Sair Khan) and supported her grandmother Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King) when she goes through a coercive control ordeal at the hands of her husband, Geoff Metcalfe (Ian Bartholomew). Storylines 2006‚Äì2010 Ryan arrives with mother Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) and it is clear that the two of them have a very close relationship. Ryan is caught by Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) vandalising The Kabin. Michelle makes him help in the newsagents every night after school for a week. For a time, Michelle dates affluent businessman Sonny Dhillon (Pal Aron). After they break up, Ryan goes joyriding in Sonny's car. He is caught by the police, though later released. When he returns to the Street, his uncle Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) smacks him across the face. The reason for this is later revealed to be that Paul caused the demise of Ryan's late father, Dean Powell, due to careless driving when Ryan was 9 years old. Later, Paul dies in a car accident after kidnapping Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Ryan is really upset after losing Paul and his father but he survives without them remembering that he still has Liam. Ryan is stalked by a mysterious stranger who knows him by name. When tracked down, the man, Nick Neeson (Robert Horwell), explains that he believes Ryan to be his real son, and his own son Alex Neeson (Dario Coates) to be Michelle's after a baby mix- up at the hospital. A DNA test later confirms this to be the case. Ryan gets extremely jealous when his mother starts taking Alex out for the day and has a fight with him. They are both hit by a car but suffer minor injuries. Ryan opens up to his uncle Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier) about how much Michelle is choosing Alex over him and then cries. Liam tells Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Michelle's boyfriend, who tells Michelle that Ryan is losing sleep over the fear of losing his only parent. Even though Michelle does not want to lose them both she still has to send Alex home because Ryan is the son that she has loved and raised since birth. She is also reassured by Steve that even though Alex is the son she had with Dean, Ryan is the son she raised with him and the son Dean knew before he died. After Alex moves out, Ryan moves back in. Ryan continues to see Nick on occasion but stops after his uncle's death. He realises that no one can compare to Dean. One time Ryan leaves his book behind, leaving his mother to chase after him starting to say he is just like his dad. Ryan becomes upset at the prospect of not inheriting anything from Dean but then Michelle reassures him that because they spent so much time together his traits have rubbed off on Ryan.

Tony sends Ryan home as he is too young to go to a strip club and later that night Liam is killed in a hit-and-run. Ryan is later informed of the news by Michelle. Ryan became inconsolable and Michelle thinks it best that he doesn't see the body at the morgue as it will upset him even more. However, Ryan adamantly argues that he has to come in order to get closure so his mother reluctantly gives in. On the day of Liam's funeral, Ryan tells Maria that he is trying to escape his grandfather Barry (Frank Grimes) because he is trying to bond with him like Liam and he is not in the mood, however, this all changes after the funeral. Ryan kisses Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson) after one of his gigs and the pair enter into a relationship. Sian's father, Vinnie (Ian Dunn) arrives on the scene, threatening Ryan as he thinks that he has been sleeping with Sian, after finding condoms in her bag. It is revealed that Sian bought the condoms and she and Ryan have sex. Sophie, Michelle and Jake Harman (Kenny Doughy) catch them, causing an argument that results in Sian leaving and spoiling Michelle and Jake's night. After Sian's father finds out that Ryan and Sian have slept together, he sends Sian to Southport to live with her mother, leaving Ryan and Sophie devastated. Sian comes back to Weatherfield and is reunited with Ryan and Sophie. Later Sian breaks up with Ryan, after suspecting that he is attracted to another girl. When Sophie finds Ryan sat on the pavement outside his house, she gives him some advice on Sian. Ryan misinterprets the situation and kisses Sophie, causing her to walk off in disgust. Ryan later begs Sophie not to tell Sian about what he did and he later makes amends with her. However, Sophie tells Sian about the kiss in front of Ryan and Sian ends the relationship for good. After Sian goes back to Southport, Ryan bumps into Sophie in the street and tells Sophie he thinks they are getting back together after Sian phoned him. However, Ryan catches Sophie and Sian kissing at the builder's yard. Although he is initially disgusted that Sian is bisexual, he agrees to keep quiet about the relationship. Ryan tires of life in Manchester but stays on, as he feels that Michelle is dependent on him, until Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) convinces him that he needs to start the life he dreams of. After spending a number of days in Glasgow with Ciaran, Ryan decides to transfer to university there and leaves Weatherfield. 2012‚Äì2013 Two years later, Ryan returns to Weatherfield and spends time with Sophie. He tries to kiss her, but she rejects him. Ryan accidentally sets alight the curtains in Steve's house and Steve finds them trying to extinguish the flames, so he tells Michelle.

Ryan begins working at Street Cars taxi firm and befriends Kylie Platt (Paula Lane). While they drink together in the Rovers, Ryan offers Kylie some cocaine, but she declines and he takes it alone in the toilets. Michelle discovers this and reports him to the police; Ryan is released with a caution. Ryan later tries conning Steve into giving him some money, but it does not work. Ryan gets a job at the local kebab shop with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who tries to seduce Ryan. They have sex and Tracy tells him that she is pregnant; they decide to move to Scotland with Tracy and Steve's daughter, Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney). Tracy confesses to Ryan that she was lying; he gets high and plays chicken on the road with Sophie. As Ryan walks across the road, Sophie pushes him out of the way of an oncoming car and is knocked down. Sophie falls unconscious and Ryan runs away, worried that he will get into trouble for being in possession of drugs. Sophie lies to the police, stating that she cannot remember what happened, before warning Ryan that she will not tell the police if he stops taking drugs; he agrees. Ryan grows closer to Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote), who gets a job working in the kebab shop. She develops feelings for Ryan and sabotages his date with Steph Britton (Tisha Merry). When Ryan confronts her, she kisses him and they begin an affair. Katy's boyfriend, Chesney Brown (Sam Aston), dislikes their friendship and feuds with Ryan.

When Katy spots Ryan with a random woman, Jamie-Lee (Kate Holderness), she ends their relationship. Steve then advises Ryan to find a long-term job, which makes Ryan realise there is nothing left for him in Weatherfield.

When Robert's best man cancels his stag do, Ryan arranges a pop star-themed party, where he clashes with Alex, now known as Ali (now played by James Burrows). On Michelle's wedding day, Ryan goes missing but is collected from a house by Robert and Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard).

After the wedding, Ryan decides to stay in Weatherfield. He applies for a job at Underworld but is eventually gets a job as a waiter at the restaurant Speed Daal. Ryan is sacked after spying on Kayla Clifton (Mollie Winnard) with Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon), but she secures Ryan a job as a labourer with Gary Windass (Mikey North). He arrives late on his first day and leaves early after completing the wrong job, angering Gary. Ryan asks Bethany on a date and they have dinner at Michelle's flat. As they get intimate, Bethany suffers a panic attack and hits Ryan several times. She rushes out, which is seen by her mother, Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), who presumes that Ryan attacked Bethany and attacks him, leaving him hospitalised. When he awakens, he cannot remember any details about the attack. When Ryan remembers the attack, he begins blackmailing Sarah for money. Ryan decides to return to Ibiza but changes his mind after speaking with Michelle. Sarah stands up to Ryan, so he stops blackmailing her and resumes his friendship with Bethany. In October 2018, Ryan and Michelle become involved in a feud with gangster Ronan Truman (Alan McKenna) after Ryan is present when his son, Cormac, overdoses on drugs but Ryan does not call an ambulance, fearing that Cormac will be sent to prison. After Ronan threatens the Connors after going to Cormac's funeral, Michelle drives her, Ryan and Ali out of Weatherfield, only to be chased by Ronan. After a car chase, the car breaks down, due to Tracy damaging it in a bid to get mechanic Abi Franklin (Sally Carman) in trouble, and Ryan tries to face Ronan himself but is knocked down by his car. As Michelle and Ali tend to Ryan's bloodied body, Leanne sees the commotion, but Ronan reverses and hits her with his car too, before crashing the car himself. Ronan is impaled by a sharp piece of wood, which Ali rips out of him as he states that he will continue to make the Connors suffer, killing Ronan. As Ryan begins to recover in hospital, Bethany begins to realise her true feelings for Ryan. When Ryan returns home, he and Bethany kiss, and they begin dating. When a traumatized Ali begins taking his anger out on everyone, especially Ryan, Michelle, and Robert, he flirts with Bethany, and Ryan goes to punch him, as Michelle and Robert walk into the bistro. Robert accidentally lets it slip that Ali killed Ronan to Ryan, and Ryan confronts a beaten-up Ali after he gets into a fight, as Ali was criticising Ryan for Cormac's death, and Ryan argues with Michelle and Robert as they defend Ali.  Casting  Thompson auditioned for the role of Cameron McIntyre in 2006, however the producers asked him to audition for the part of Ryan Connor instead. His audition was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year. Thompson billed his character as \\"mischievous\\" and said that he is \\"not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either.\\" Series editor Garth Philips teased the Connor family, calling them \\"a twenty-first century Coronation Street family\\". He said that the family are \\"a joy to watch on screen\\" and the audience would be \\"enthralled and excited by them\\". Thompson made his debut appearance as Ryan on 30 August 2006.  Development   Early storylines  In October 2007, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would involve Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) finding out that Ryan may not be her son. A show insider told the Daily Star: \\"Can there really be anything more traumatic for a parent to have to endure?\\" The storyline ended in early 2008 and was not mentioned since. Speaking of the storyline Ben Thompson said: \\"It's weird that for such a massive storyline it never came to anything, It's been one of those very weird ones in terms of that storyline. It's sort of been forgotten and I don't understand how and if they are going to follow it up.\\" In 2009, Ryan began a relationship with Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson). Thompson filmed his first screen kiss with her. He said of the experience, \\"It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her. I knew it every time, and every time I said it I was shaking.\\" He continued, \\"Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, but it was just bizarre. It was one of those things that I got really nervous about.\\" Upon his 2012 return, it was announced that Ryan would embark on a relationship with an older woman.  Departure (2010)  In August 2010, it was rumoured that Coronation Street producer Phil Collinson was considering axing a number of the younger cast including Ryan, Chesney Battersby-Brown (Sam Aston) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) because he feared that the show was becoming more like Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks. On-screen Ryan chose to attend a Scottish university and he departed in October. The character's departure was confirmed but the producers denied that they had axed Ryan. An ITV spokesperson said: \\"Ryan hasn't been axed from the show and is still very much a part of Michelle Connor's life. There are plans to see him in future episodes when he returns from university for holidays. In October 2010, Thompson said of his departure: \\"It wasn't my choice to leave Coronation Street,\\" he said. \\"But a new producer came in and wanted to shake things up. I am one of the characters that sadly wasn't part of the plan. Ryan is being sent off to university and can come back, but I don't know if that will happen for the foreseeable future. I am sad, because it has been the biggest part of my life for the past four years. It has given me the freedom to work on my music, though. Writing music is something I have always done, but I've never been able to focus on it before because I had to do Coronation Street. It's nice to be able to do something completely different to acting. Kym Marsh revealed that she was upset over Thompson's departure as they were both very close.  Reintroduction (2012)  In March 2012, Simon Boyle of the Daily Mirror reported that Ryan would be returning to Coronation Street. Boyle said Ryan would return as \\"a very dark character\\" who has a \\"damaging impact\\" on the soap's younger residents. The character's return was not confirmed until 17 May 2012. Sol Heras took over the role from Thompson, after he chose not to return to the soap. A writer for itv.com stated that Ryan returns home unexpectedly after he is thrown out of university. Series producer Collinson said \\"Ryan returns carrying a dark secret and Michelle is going to have the fight of her life as she battles to get her troubled son back on the straight and narrow. Sol is a brilliant young actor and I'm so excited to welcome him to the cast.\\" Asked about his audition Sol Heras said: \\"I thought initially that it would be quite a long, drawn-out process, but it all happened quite quickly! I had my first audition with the casting department, and then I heard later that I'd made it onto the longlist of actors that they were considering. After that, I made it onto the shortlist, which to me was an achievement in itself. I then had a screen test with Kym Marsh and Brooke Vincent. Six days later, my agent phoned me to tell me that I'd got the part - so that was one of the best phone calls I've ever had.\\"  Drug abuse  In May 2012, it was rumoured that once Ryan would return he would now be a much darker character and would become involved in a drug storyline with Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Kym Marsh who plays Michelle Connor confirmed the storyline in June 2012, Marsh said: \\"Ryan's been off doing his own thing, and has got heavily involved in drugs. Michelle expected him to come back as the same kid he was before he went away, but that's not going to happen.\\" Asked how difficult this experience will be for Michelle, the actress replied: \\"Very hard. Michelle's got her work cut out trying to get Ryan back on the straight and narrow, but we'll see her get support from outside influences.\\" Speaking of the storyline Sol Heras said: \\"It's a very serious storyline but in the real world it does happen. As long as it's done professionally and done well, it's great. I think it'll be good for young people to see the consequences that come from drugs. You'll see that the drugs are the reason that Ryan is falling out with everyone and causing trouble. There's a loneliness to Ryan because no-one really trusts him. It just shows that it's a bad way to go.\\" Speaking of being compared to Ben Thompson (who previously portrayed Ryan) he said: \\"Ryan is not the way he was before and he's picked up bad habits, so that's enabled me to come in and essentially be a fresh character, He's changed so much that I didn't have to stick to how the previous actor had played him, which really helps when you're coming into a new show.\\"  Relationship with Katy Armstrong  While Ryan and Katy are running an errand together, their van breaks down and Katy and Ryan end up sharing a kiss. The following month, Foote teased the storyline during an appearance on Daybreak explaining that it begins when Katy is teased by her friends for being dull. The actress continued \\"It's her friend's 18th birthday, so they're having a party. They all keep taking the mick out of her, saying she's sitting at home and she's boring. She just wants to go out and have fun, and then [Ryan] starts making a bit of a move on her!\\" Ryan \\"sees Katy in a new light\\" when she turns up at The Bistro for her friend's birthday, where he is DJing. Heras commented that his character has not really noticed Katy before, as she is a stay at home mother, but seeing her \\"dolled up\\" and in his environment catches his attention. Heras said \\"He realises how pretty she is and what a gorgeous girl she is. He manages to sort it for her to get a job at the kebab shop and yes he probably does have an ulterior motive.\\" Katy and Ryan start to become closer at the kebab shop and one day go in for another kiss. Foote believed that Katy had not had a \\"teenage wild time\\" because of her relationship with Chesney and their son, so her head is turned by Ryan and it is exciting for her. Foote added that Katy does not mean to hurt Chesney, but the situation with Ryan gets out of her control. Chesney later proposes to Katy in front of their family and friends at Faye Windass' (Ellie Leach) birthday party, but hours later he learns about her affair with Ryan. The Daily Star's Peter Dyke and Katie Begley reported that Chesney would confront Katy in front of their son, demanding to know whether she had sex with Ryan and threatening to beat him up. Chesney then \\"calls time on their romance\\" and throws Katy out.  Departure (2013)  On 21 July 2013, Ed Gleave and Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Heras had quit Coronation Street. The actor left at the end of his contract, while his character left later in the year. Ryan's exit storyline saw him decide to take a job as a DJ in Ibiza, after realising that there is nothing keeping him in Weatherfield. Steve suggests that Ryan should go to Ibiza and live his life. Steve knows that Michelle is worried about Ryan so he sees it as an opportunity to solve their problems. Gregson told a reporter from TV Choice that his character was just offering Ryan advice. Steve's actions do not go according to plan when Michelle blames him for Ryan's departure.  Reintroduction (2018)  This Morning presenter Sharon Marshall announced on 7 February 2018 that Ryan would be reintroduced during the year. Ryan returns following the reintroduction of Michelle's biological son, Ali Neeson (James Burrows). It was unconfirmed whether Heras would reprise the role. Series producer Kate Oates confirmed on 12 March 2018 that the role of Ryan would be recast. She told Ben Lee of Digital Spy that an actor had been cast, although she refused to reveal his identity. It was revealed on 26 March 2018 that actor Ryan Prescott had been cast in the role of Ryan. Paparazzi photographs were released showing Prescott filming with cast members Tristan Gemmill (Robert Preston) and Rob Mallard (Daniel Osbourne).  Reception  All About Soap Laura Morgan called Ryan a \\"sweet, caring lad\\" while played by Thompson. Upon the character's return in 2012, Morgan stated that he was \\"rebellious\\" and \\"a lazy oik\\".

Hewlett-Packard resignation  In early 2005, after news leaks about then-CEO Carly Fiorina's clashes with the board surfaced, Fiorina hired a law firm to find the source. In February 2005, Fiorina left the company and Patricia Dunn, non-executive chairwoman, continued the investigation. As part of a larger scandal, a subcontractor used pretexting to expose Keyworth as the source of an alleged additional leak to CNET, and he was outed at a May 18, 2006 board meeting. At the meeting, Dunn asked Keyworth to resign, he refused asserting that he was not the source of any unauthorized or inappropriate communication with reporters, and another board member (Tom Perkins) resigned over the way Keyworth was being treated. HP revealed the story on September 6, 2006 and said that they were not seeking Keyworth's reelection to the board. Coinciding with Mark V. Hurd's promotion to chairman, Keyworth resigned on September 12. In connection with Keyworth's resignation, HP made the following statement regarding the alleged CNET leak: \\"At HP's request, Dr. Keyworth often had contacts with the press to explain HP's interests. The board does not believe that Dr. Keyworth's contact with CNET in January 2006 was vetted through appropriate channels, but also recognizes that his discussion with the CNET reporter was undertaken in an attempt to further HP's interests.

The GTC was established by the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 which set two aims: \\"to contribute to improving standards of teaching and the quality of learning, and to maintain and improve standards of professional conduct among teachers, in the interests of the public\\". The GTC was abolished in 2012 with some of its functions being assumed by the Teaching Agency, an executive agency of the Department for Education, which in 2013 became the National College for Teaching and Leadership. Functions In line with the aims set by the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, the GTC had three principal functions. Maintaining a register of teachers in England The GTC was the awarding body for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in England. Registration with the GTC was a legal requirement for all qualified teachers in maintained schools, pupil referral units and non-maintained special schools. In addition, around a third of teachers in the independent sector were registered with the GTC. There were over 560,000 teachers on the GTC register. Regulating the teaching profession The GTC published the Code of Conduct and Practice for Teachers. This code formed the basis of the regulatory process of the GTC. The GTC regulated the conduct and competence of teachers according to this code. Teachers' employers were required to tell the GTC when a teacher had been dismissed because of misconduct or incompetence or where they resigned in circumstances justifying dismissal. The GTC could make the decision to remove from their register or restrict any teacher who had 'compromised the public confidence of the profession' or who had put 'the safety and welfare of children at risk'.Code of Conduct and Practice The GTC regulated all \\"Registered Teachers\\", in other words any teacher working in maintained (state) schools. The GTC could also regulate teachers who were no longer registered provided misconduct or incompetence occurred when they were registered. The GTC convened panels to hear cases. Each panel was normally held in public, and included two teachers, one lay member, and a legal advisor employed by the GTC. Panels were drawn from members of the Council plus a pool of specially appointed panellists. The GTC employed a presenting officer who was often a leading solicitor in the field of Professional Discipline. A panel had the powers to issue reprimands, issue a conditional registration order (continued GTC registration required the teacher to adhere to certain conditions set at the hearing), suspend a teacher from the register, or prohibit a teacher from registration The GTC did not pay costs to teachers found not guilty of misconduct at hearings. Legal representation at hearings could cost up to ¬£40,000. Some teachers were represented by trade unions, although Trade Unions employ solicitors and barristers to comply with the Human Rights legislation affording defendants equal representation to the barristers and solicitors employed by the GTCE. Providing advice to government and other agencies The GTC gave advice to government and others on a wide range of policy issues that affect the teaching profession including issues relating to standards of teaching and learning. Advice had previously been givenGTC policy papers on topics including: supporting the professional development of teachers; pupil assessment; teacher retention, and prevention of teachers leaving the profession; equality and diversity in schools and the workforce; working with other (non-teaching) adults in schools; teacher and school accountability; supporting teachers to effectively teach children with Special Educational Needs Legal requirement Being fully registered with the GTC was a legal requirement if you were employed in the maintained sector. Those qualified teachers working in independent schools could register voluntarily.GTC website registration section Composition of the council The GTC had 64 members.List of GTC Council members Elections to the council were made on a four-year cycle, except the chair and vice chair of the council, which were elected annually. The GTC convened four times a year to discuss policy and regulation of the teaching profession. The GTC was composed of: *25 members elected from GTC registered teachers *9 members who are nominated by professional teaching organisations and trade unions *17 members nominated through other teaching related organisations *13 members nominated the GTC's public appointments procedure The Council's first Chief Executive from 2000 until 2006 was educationalist Carol Adams. Primary sources The archives of the GTC and the GTC Trust are held in the archives of the Institute of Education, University of London and a full catalogue can be found online. Abolition The Principal Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, announced on 2 June 2010 of the Government's decision and intention to abolish the General Teaching Council for England by primary legislation. The Times Educational Supplement lamented the demise of the GTC and criticised the role of school teaching trade unions causing the profession to become little more than an extension to the civil service.http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6106649 References External links * *Records of the GTC (England and Wales) and the GTC (England and Wales) Trust at the Institute of Education Archives Category:1998 establishments in England Category:Department for Education Category:Educational organisations based in England Category:Higher education regulators Category:Organisations based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Professional associations based in the United Kingdom Category:2012 disestablishments in England Category:Teaching in the United Kingdom ","title":"General Teaching Council for England"},{"id":"6896592","text":"Vi≈°tuk (, ) is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Pezinok District in the Bratislava region. The town is located north of Senec and east of Modra. History Archeologists found remains of settlements from roughly 5000 BC. The modern history of the village begins in 1244, when it is first mentioned under the name Vyscha. At that time the village was very new. The entire region was decimated during the 1241-42 Mongol invasion, and subsequently resettled by German winemakers. After another decline in the first half of the 16th century, the town experienced significant growth, largely due to an influx of Croatian settlers in 1540. Vi≈°tuk is situated at the merger of three creeks and once had several water reservoirs, the largest of which still exists today. By the end of the 16th Century, the village was one of the largest in the ƒåerven√Ω Kame≈à county. In 1573 the town built its Roman Catholic church of Holy Trinity, in the place of an older, Gothic church. Roughly at the same time, a smaller church was built, later rebuilt into a chapel. The village's golden age took a sharp turn in 1705, when it was burned to the ground during the Battle of Budmerice, during the 1703-11 Hungarian independence war led by Francis II R√°k√≥czi. The town was rebuilt, only to be burned down three more times in the 18th century. During that time, Anton Benƒçiƒç, a Catholic priest, translator and one of the first proponents of the Slovak language, was born in Vi≈°tuk in 1745. In the 19th and 20th century the village grew somewhat, mainly thanks to its vineyards. In 1920, the current name, Vi≈°tuk, was codified. Infrastructure and Industry Vi≈°tuk has centralized water and gas distribution, but not a sewage system. The village lies outside of main roads, and is thus only serviced by local intercity buses. It does not have direct access to a railway. There is a school and a medical doctor in the village, the latter being present twice per week for adults and once per week for children. The village has shifted its focus from small businesses to tourism. It sits on the so-called \\"Low Carpathian Mountains Wine Route\\", which connects all major wine producing towns in the area. The town's Muller Thurgau wines are considered to be of above average quality. The town's annual farmer's market ties into the wine making, and has been drawing many visitors to the village every year. In addition, the village has created a natural area, including a unique nesting place for swallows. It consists of a sandstone wall with hundreds of holes that the swallows use for nesting in the spring. Culture and Entertainment The village has its own folk band, Vi≈°tuƒçanka, established in 1990. The band's managers have aggressively worked to develop the band up to par with much more established bands from neighboring villages. In addition, the town has a library and a movie theater, which has one to two showings every month. The town's soccer club, established in 1931, is playing in Slovakia's lowest, sixth division soccer league. The football field is being occasionally used for other sporting events, such as a recent football tournament promoting ethnic tolerance.

Storylines Liam first appeared on Coronation Street in August 2006 when he and nephew Ryan (Ben Thompson) visit his sister Michelle at the Rovers Return Inn. Whilst there he overhears Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) discussing his unhappiness running local factory Underworld with his half-brother, Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh). Liam calls on his wealthy brother Paul (Sean Gallagher) to help him purchase the factory. The brothers manage to convince the teenager to sell his 40% share for ¬£80,000, less than half its value. Liam also briefly romances Frankie Baldwin, putting himself in a difficult situation with Frankie's husband and the Connor brothers' new business partner Danny. The death of Dean, Michelle's late partner, in a car crash, is later discovered not to have been caused by Dean's own driving, when in 2007 Liam confesses to Michelle that their brother, Paul, was driving that night, and that Paul and Liam had moved Dean's body into the driving seat so that Paul would not face criminal charges. Michelle initially disowns her brothers but is reconciled with Liam after Paul's death. Liam dates Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), thinking that she is an estate agent but she is secretly working as a female escort. Liam's sister-in-law, Carla, goes shopping regularly with Leanne, and one day one of Leanne's clients sees them together and asks Carla if she is an escort too. Carla reluctantly agrees to keep Leanne's secret from Liam. Paul discovers Leanne's secret when he books an escort to come to a hotel room he has booked and Leanne turns up; they agree to keep each other's secret until Carla finds out, and refuses to believe that Paul and Leanne haven't slept together. In an attempt to convince her, Paul kidnaps Leanne and locks her in his car boot. After jumping a red traffic light at a crossroads, Paul's Mercedes crashes into a skip and overturns. Liam rescues Leanne from the boot of the car, but Carla reveals that Leanne is working as a prostitute, and their relationship does not survive the revelation. Paul dies of his injuries in hospital and Liam is devastated by his brother's death and blames Leanne. Liam is attracted to Maria Sutherland, with whom he begins a casual relationship. A few weeks into their relationship, Maria discovers that she is pregnant, and they decide to abort the child. Liam is happy with this initially but after comments made by Carla, he proposes to Maria. He asks her to keep the baby and she agrees happily, unaware of Liam's hidden feelings for Carla. Maria buys Liam a dog, Ozzy. During a trip to the Lake District in January 2008, Liam falls down a ravine while searching for Ozzy. While semi- conscious, he calls out for Carla, making Maria feel insecure. In an attempt to cement their relationship, she brings their wedding forward to 11 February 2008. Liam is a little shocked, but agrees. During an argument with Carla about her new boyfriend, Liam and Carla kiss passionately. She pulls away, leaving them confused about their feelings for each other. Liam tries to concentrate on his relationship with Maria and their baby but Carla starts interfering between him and Maria. She attempts to create opportunities to seduce Liam, such as booking a double room at a hotel for a conference they are to attend together. Carla's plans are ruined when Tony turns up at the hotel. Carla tries to warn Maria off Liam. Prior to the wedding, Maria spots Carla kissing him, and almost calls off the wedding. When Maria refuses to get out of the car, he goes outside and convinces her that she is the one for him. He insists that all he wants was a life with her and their baby and they marry, even though he knows that he really loves Carla. During April 2008, after a row with Liam about him spending the night at Carla's, Maria is horrified to discover that her baby has stopped kicking. She goes with sonographer Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) for an emergency scan and is told that her child has died. On 30 April, still estranged from Liam, she goes into hospital and gives birth to the deceased infant. She decides not to tell Liam that she has lost the baby because she fears that Liam has only married her because she was pregnant. Maria keeps the news of the stillbirth from Liam and stays at Audrey Roberts's (Sue Nicholls). Liam only finds out about his child's death from the midwife when she calls to check on Maria. The newly married couple have a huge argument, which climaxes in Maria declaring that the marriage is over, just under three months into it. With Maria leaving him, Liam sinks into depression and seeks comfort in Carla, sleeping with her. Later that day, Liam is just leaving Carla's flat when they stop in the doorway for a goodbye kiss unaware that up the road walking is their assistant Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan). On catching glimpse of the lovers, Rosie quickly jumps out of their sight and seizing an opportunity, takes a video of the tender moment before Liam drives off. Liam and Carla later agree that he will tell Maria about their relationship but instead Maria apologises for not telling him sooner that she lost the baby and asks him to give her a second chance. So, that day, he tells Carla that he and Maria are back together and are off on holiday. On their return, Carla's revenge is to insist that Liam sell his share of Underworld to Tony or she would tell Maria about them sleeping together. Liam gives in, as he and Maria are discussing trying for another baby. Bored at home all day, Liam and his cousin, Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley) start a new business called Lad Rags. Tom, however, fails to persuade the bank to loan them ¬£50K so he asks Carla to invest, which she does. Liam is furious when he finds out, telling Tom that her 25% share is coming out of his half of the business. Knowing that neither Tony or Maria would be pleased about them working together, they agree to keep it a secret from them and it is clear that Liam and Carla still have strong feelings for each other. In September 2008, Rosie Webster decides to seduce Tony and invites him to a hotel room. When he arrives, he is stunned to find Rosie draped over the bed semi-naked and it all becomes clear to Tony what her game is. He subsequently harshly rejects Rosie, telling her he only has eyes for Carla and that she is nothing but a silly little girl. Humiliated, Rosie exacts her revenge and shows Tony the video footage of Liam and Carla kissing. Upon seeing the footage, Tony is silenced and leaves the hotel with Rosie's phone, which he later dumps in the canal after copying the video. Initially hesitant, Tony sees red when he catches Carla with Liam once again, and plans his revenge. The next day Tony surprises Carla by taking her, Liam and Maria to the lakes on a weekend away, raising suspicion with Liam and Carla who begin to question what he is up to. At the lakes, Tony leads Liam astray on a country walk and the pair end up stood at the edge of a cave cliff with Liam clearly very anxious as it brings back memories of his fall in the Lake District in January that year. Liam is left stunned however when Tony chooses that moment to ask him to be his best man at his wedding to Carla. As they hug, Tony jokingly says that he is going to push Liam over the edge, an ominous sign of Liam's fate. The following week, upon seeing Carla in her wedding dress, Liam reignites his passion with her as they sleep together once more, with Tony almost catching them in the act as he dashes home. The next day, as the stag and hen parties are about to commence, Liam meets Carla in secret to remind her that he loves her and desperately urges her to call off the wedding. In a moment alone during her hen party, Carla sits down for a heart-to-heart with best friend Leanne, who tells her to follow her heart. Her words strike a chord and Carla finally decides she is going to end her engagement to Tony to be with Liam but when Michelle and Maria return to the table, Michelle shares her suspicion that Maria is pregnant, which she happily confirms to the group. Carla is heartbroken and, not wanting to be the one to take away the unborn child's father, urges Maria to tell Liam the news. That night, as the boys are on a pub crawl, Liam realises he has left his wallet behind in the pub that they have just left and is told by Tony to go back and get it. However, as Liam is walking across the road, he is hit and killed instantly by a car at high speed driven by Jimmy Dockerson (Robert Beck), the man who Tony had hired to kill Liam. In tears, Tony falls to the floor, and orders everyone to move out of the way and call an ambulance. Moments after the incident, Maria arrives to tell Liam her news but is distraught to find him lying motionless on the road. Carla, meanwhile, is forced to hold back the true extent of her own devastation as husband-to-be Tony looms over the lifeless body. Later, Tony heads to the canal and out of his pocket he pulls Liam's wallet which he had stolen earlier as part of his elaborate plan to kill his love rival. Tony then callously takes out the cash in the wallet throws it into the water below. Liam's funeral is held on 27 October 2008. Creation and casting Coronation Street's Connor family were introduced by producer Steve Frost after Kym Marsh made a series of guest appearances as singer Michelle Connor. Marsh was soon given a regular role, and a family for her character were brought into the storyline, including a pair of brothers who were likened by newspaper reports to the Gallagher brothers from Rock band Oasis and the Mitchell brothers Phil and Grant from rival soap opera EastEnders. In July 2006, Rob James-Collier was announced as Michelle's brother Liam, described as \\"a loveable rogue\\" with \\"an eye for the ladies\\". It was said that, upon his arrival, he would set his sights on Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson). Rob, who had worked as a marketing assistant before becoming an actor, said that the role was \\"a dream come true\\". Development Departure (2008) In February 2008, it was confirmed that Collier had made the decision to leave the programme, after two years portraying of Liam. On his decision to leave the show, Collier stated that he had a fear of being typecast, and wished to experience new projects. It was later announced that the character would be killed off near to the end of the year, at the actor's personal request. Prior to his departure, the three main suspects to fans to murder Liam included his wife Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie), Carla Connor (Alison King) and Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien). Three alternative departures for the character were filmed, with only one departure being broadcast on television, though the other two were available to be viewed on the official ITV website; Liam was killed off after being hit by a car, arranged by Tony, on Tony's stag night, with the other departures including Tony pushing Liam off a balcony from a two-floored flat, and being shot by Tony during a game of paint-balling. In September 2008, producers said that a week of episodes would unfold in \\"real time\\", set over a period of 24 hours following the events leading to his impending exit. Reception The character of Liam Connor has been widely praised since his introduction. Upon his exit in 2008, columnist Jim Shelley described Liam as \\"the most handsome, charming, likeable character in the series\\". Gareth McLean of the Guardian however, criticised Rob James- Collier's acting skills: \\"Apparently, Liam (Rob James-Collier) is leaving Coronation Street for fear of being type-cast. (As what? A sideboard? A life- sized wooden replica of a person?)\\" References Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Fictional characters involved in incest Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Liam Connor"},{"id":"6896625","text":"Gruni () may refer to several villages in Romania: * Gruni, a village in Cornereva Commune, Cara≈ü-Severin County * Gruni, a village in Belin≈£ Commune, Timi»ô County See also * Gruny (disambiguation) ","title":"Gruni"},{"id":"6896626","text":"Gulia may refer to: * Gulia clan, a Jat clan of India * Dmitry Gulia (1874‚Äì1960), Abkhazian Soviet writer and poet * Gavino Gulia (1835‚Äì1889), Maltese botanist * Guliya, a village in Bulgaria * Gulia, a village in TƒÉrtƒÉ»ôe»ôti Commune in Romania * Gulia, a village in the town of Dolhasca in Romania  See also  * Gulia Tutberidze Stadium, a stadium in Zugdidi, Georgia * Giulia (disambiguation), an Italian name (including a list of people with the name) ","title":"Gulia"},{"id":"6896629","text":"Lyons Maid is a brand of ice-creams and ice-lollies created in 1925J. Lyons & Co: Products - Group 2 as a spin-off from the J. Lyons and Co. retail organisation. It is now owned by the Froneri joint venture. Well-known brands produced by Lyons Maid included: Zoom (no longer in production), Strawberry Mivvi, Orange Maid, Lolly Gobble Choc Bomb, Fab and Haunted House. Its most commercially successful period was probably during the 1970s when a vast range of ice-lollies were sold. This range often had tie-ins to well-known characters from TV and film and included free gifts. It often involved inventive wrapper designs, and cartoon strips were also launched. Examples include a tie-in with Space: 1999 with free cards of episodes inside the wrapper, Star Wars with free masks of major characters and film facts on the wrappers, The Bionic Man TV series, Superman and even a Goal lolly with lolly sticks containing famous footballers of the day. The Lyons Maid brand logo, sometimes known as the 'Good Time Sign' but more generally referred to in house as the 'Dancing Children' was initially developed by advertising agency Young & Rubicam to identify the brand in sweet shops and later on packaging and on ice cream vans but was eventually phased in across the whole product range where it continued to be used on branding and shop signage until Lyons Maid was sold to Nestl√© in 1992. At that time, Nestl√© combined its standard international blue-and-white ice cream logo with the Lyons Maid logotype and the three dancing children from the Good Time Sign until 1998, when the Lyons Maid brand was dropped in favour of a standardised Nestl√© ice cream logo. Lyons Maid's chief rival was Wall's ice cream now owned by Unilever. Walls produced such staples as Cornetto, which remains in production. In 2008, Lyons Maid was revived when R&R; Ice Cream decided to restore the brand. Charlotte Hambling, senior marketing manager of R&R;, stated at the time: \\"By bringing back the Lyons Maid brand to family dinner tables across the country, we will be tapping into the great nostalgia the brand enjoys, as well as the strong consumer heritage and high levels of consumer awareness and trust within the brand. With our new Lyons Maid products, we are taking advantage of these factors and introducing a range of family favourites, as well as re- establishing the brand\\".

It was constructed by Hindustan Construction Company (HCC),the company which constructed the 2,253 m long Farakka Barrage, the longest in the world. Construction of the barrage was taken up in the 1960s and it was commissioned in 1968. The Canal System In 1873-74, one of the oldest irrigation systems in the country was developed with an anicut across the Son at Dehri. Water from the Son fed canal systems on both sides of the river and irrigated large areas. A barrage was constructed 8 km upstream of the anicut. Two link canals connected the new reservoir to the old irrigation system and also extended it. Sir John Houlton , the veteran British administrator, described (in 1949) the Son canal system as follows, \\"This is easily the largest canal system in Bihar; there are 209 miles of main canals, 149 of branch canals and 1,235 of distributaries‚Ä¶ The canals are of enormous benefit to cultivation. They have converted a large area of infertile land into a richly productive area.\\"Houlton, Sir John, Bihar, the Heart of India, pp. 47-48, Orient Longmans, 1949.

As per the National River Linking Project of the National Water Development Agency, there is a proposal for linking the Ganges with the Son, through the 149.10 km Chunar-Sone Barrage Link Canal. The canal will start from the right side of the Ganges near Chunar tehsil of Mirzapur district in UP and would link to the Indrapuri barrage. There would be three lifts at three places on the route.

Portrayed by Sean Gallagher, the character arrives with the rest of his family as one of Michelle Connor's (Kym Marsh) two brothers, first appearing during an episode that aired on 6 September 2006. He was later killed off on 6 June 2007, following the actor's decision to leave the cast after only nine months. Storylines 2006‚Äì2007 The character comes to Coronation Street when his brother Liam (Rob James-Collier) contacts him concerning Adam Barlow's (Sam Robertson) intention to sell his share of Underworld. The two brothers are introduced as brothers of barmaid Michelle. After buying Adam's share of the factory, Paul spends money set aside for his wife, Carla's (Alison King) children's clothing business, causing a row between the couple. Paul stays in touch with a previous owner of the factory, Danny Baldwin, and tells him that Frankie (Debra Stephenson) and Jamie's (Rupert Hill) have split up and buys Danny's 60% share of Underworld. When Michelle's son, Ryan (Ben Thompson), is arrested for joy-riding, Paul violently attacks him upon his return from the police station. This makes Carla suspect that Paul is keeping a dark secret from her. Liam later reveals that Paul was driving on the night that Michelle's late partner, Dean, died. Paul and Liam then moved Dean's body to the driver's seat to avoid arrest for drink driving. This leads to Michelle disowning both her brothers. Paul proves to be an accomplished schemer by covering up the death of Polish factory worker Kasia Barowicz (Irena Rodic). He claims that she had died in the day shift when she was actually working illegally at night. Paul is shocked to discover that Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), Liam's girlfriend, is a prostitute, having hired her. He and Leanne agree to keep each other's secrets but Paul becomes frustrated, watching Liam and Leanne get closer. To protect his marriage, he tells Liam that Leanne is a gold-digger but Liam ignores him. Paul is also uncomfortable about Leanne and Carla going into business together, eventually revealing that she is also a prostitute. Carla later discovers that Paul is her client, ending their marriage, with Paul blaming Leanne. As revenge, Paul locks Leanne in the boot of his car. The car crashes into a lorry whilst he was on the phone to Liam, which made him lose concentration. Following this, he and Leanne are rushed to hospital. Whilst Leanne survives with only a broken rib, Paul dies of his injuries. Carla and Liam blame Leanne for her part in the accident and Paul is buried in Ireland. Later in 2008, Liam, newlywed to Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie), names their stillborn baby son after Paul. Paul is mentioned again in November 2009 when Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) plan to play golf at a high class golf club. However, Steve was a guest member with Paul at the time but since Paul died, Steve is no longer a guest member. Development Casting Prior to the characters arrival, a Coronation Street insider claimed that little was known about the Connor brothers, aside from the fact that they're in the rag trade and started out on the markets. The insider speculated that Paul and his brother are just on the right side of the law, though not out-and-out villainous. Upon their arrival, the brothers were planned to cause trouble for Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh). Departure Early in 2007, actor Sean Gallagher's resignation from the soap opera was revealed. Coronation Street scriptwriters planned for his character to be killed off. During an interview, Gallagher claimed that his role on the show was what he'd hoped for, though he would rather play a variety of roles. The actor agreed with executive producer Steve Frost to leave at the end of his contract. The character was originally planned to be killed in Underworld itself; however, this was not clear.

The town of roughly 5,000 people lies east of Pezinok and south of Modra, and is connected to each via a main road. Another road connects ≈†enkvice to Blatn√©, which lies about five kilometers (three miles) south-east. ≈†enkvice is said to be the largest Slovak municipality without a city status. Name and etymology The name derives from a Slavic personal name ƒåan√≠k (1256, villa Chanuk). The German colonists adopted the Slovak name (probably ƒåan√≠kovce) as Sankawych, Sankavich (1390) and finally as Schenkowitz, Schenkwitz. In the 16th century, the village was abandoned and resettled by the Croatians who adopted the German name and changed it to ≈†enkvice. This became also the Slovak name. History Early settlements from the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found in the town, as well as signs of human activity during Ancient Roman times. The first written record of the village can be found in a letter by the Hungarian king B√©la IV from 1256. The town was burned down during the Mongol invasion. Soon, the area was resettled by German settlers. In 1547 the village has experienced an influx of Croatians,See ≈†enkviƒçan, 2006 issue 3, page 5 who were fleeing from the advancing Ottoman Empire. More Croatians from the town of Hrvatska Kostajnica came in 1594 and founded a small settlement nearby, originally called Small ≈†enkvice. Later, it merged into ≈†enkvice. In 1682, the town has built fortifications around the Church of Saint Anne, where the inhabitants hid during Ottoman incursions. During the Middle Ages, the village built its first church, roughly in 1350 in Gothic style. The church has burned down and was replaced by a new one in the second half of the 16th century. This church was later expanded and in 1666 rebuilt in Renaissance style with some Baroque elements. The church has retained this look till today. After the Ottomans were driven off, the town began stagnating. Not even the opening of a railroad line connecting ≈†enkvice with Pezinok in 1845 has revived the village, and only after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 the town started experiencing growth, thanks to an influx of new companies. Economy and infrastructure ≈†enkvice is best known for its wine production. The largest winemaker in the town is Karpatsk√° Perla, which has received several awards for its wines. In addition, the town has a bakery, Framipek, which supplies stores in from Senec to Pezinok, and a plastic sheeting manufacturer, Novplasta. The village is fully gasified, and it has water and sewage systems. There is a train station, as well as several bus links to the surrounding cities. ≈†enkvice has a kindergarten and grade school, a fire station, health center, library and town museum. Culture and entertainment The town features a young folk group, Mlados≈•. It also has a town museum, currently consisting of one room near the Culture House. The Culture House features theatre and musical shows, including performances by the town's volunteer theater group, which celebrated its 100th birthday in 2006. ≈†enkvice has a soccer team, which plays in the Slovak league's next-to-lowest fourth division. The town also has a gymnastic team and a field hockey team as well. However, it is most famous for its indoors motocross track. Demographics As of December 31, 2004, the town had 4327 inhabitants: 2131 male and 2196 female. 98.2% of them were of Slovak ethnicity; the largest minority was Czech. 86.9% were Roman Catholics, 2.2% Lutherans and 8.8% atheists. Of the 1199 houses in the village, 1056 were permanently occupied.

He captained the Argonauta during the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and in 1812 commanded Royalist troops during the Chilean War of Independence (1810‚Äì26). Biography Youth and early career Pareja was born in Cabra, near C√≥rdoba, Spain and was fascinated with the Navy from childhood. He enlisted as a midshipman in 1771 and sailed in several naval task forces, attending many actions. He distinguished himself by taking the islands of St. Peter and St. Antiochus. From February 1778 to May 1782 he commanded a frigate and a private vessel as well as a brig. His wife was Josepha Septien. In 1782 Pareja had fought with the British fleet and at Melilla, his ships on several occasions landing artillery, ammunition and food and at one point suffering a horrific fire. As commander of the frigate Perla he found himself involved in the naval Battle of Cape St Vincent (February 14, 1797). In the Bay of Algiers a galley under his command fired for eight hours at the Moors. Trafalgar In 1803 Pareja commanded the ship San Agustin and in February 1805 he acquired the ship of the Prince of Asturias and sailed to Cadiz with the combined fleets of France and Spain under the command of Admiral Villeneuve and Lieutenant General Gravina. There he was given command of the Argonauta. The following October 20 he sailed with the combined fleet of the same generals, and found himself in combat against the English Admiral Lord Nelson at Cape Trafalgar (21 October 1805). Argonauta suffered immense damage and sank the second day of the battle, which led to numerous deaths and injuries, including the injury of the Captain himself. Later that year Pareja was promoted to Brigadier. In June 1808, Pareja witnessed the battle and surrender of the French fleet of Admiral Rosily. After a period of leave in Madrid he was sent back to the department of Cadiz in 1809. He then commanded the ships Terrible and San Justo and in early 1810 all the forces of the Isla de Le√≥n. Chile Pareja commanded the island until July 1810 when he was appointed Governor and Captain-General of Chile, then in full insurrection. Pareja arrived in Lima in 1811 as Governor-Intendant of the Chilean province of Concepci√≥n. There was, however, a change in plan. At the directive of the Jos√© Fernando de Abascal, Viceroy of Peru, whose authority included the provinces of Chile, Pareja organized an expedition against Chilo√© and Valdivia which had declared their independence. In late February 1813, Pareja gathered 2,400 men and took the little port of San Vicente, adjacent to Talcahuano. He then immediately marched upon Concepci√≥n, which he took possession of with the aid of the native militia. He augmented his forces to about 4,000 soldiers and at once marched upon Chill√°n which surrendered without a fight and swelled his army with another 2,000 soldiers. In the meantime, Brigadier Jos√© Miguel Carrera, head of the Independentist government, had organized the resistance in Santiago. Both armies met at the Battle of Yerbas Buenas (April 27, 1813). The Independentists, who had attempted a night surprise, were forced to retreat. Pareja, sick with pneumonia, then decided to retreat himself back to Chill√°n. He was already so sick that he had to be carried on a stretcher. In Chill√°n he had to submit to a prolonged siege. While there, the port of Talcahuano was recaptured by the Independentists, who also managed to capture the frigate Tomas which was coming from Callao with re-enforcements. Pareja, already weakened by his pneumonia and aggrieved by these reverses, died shortly afterward. His command of the Royalist army was assumed by Juan Francisco S√°nchez. Legacy Pareja's son, Vice Admiral Jos√© Manuel Pareja (1813‚Äì1865) commanded the Spanish fleet during the Chincha Islands War (1864‚Äì1866).

The first known game played under the British Association rules saw Oakland defeat Coraki on Saturday 8 July 1911. The first football club formed in the Lismore area was the Lismore Athletic Football Club which was formed at the Lismore School of Arts in May 1914. The first game of football featuring a side from Lismore was played in June 1914 when students from the Wollongbar Experiment Farm played Lismore Athletic Soccer Club at the farm. The Lismore Athletic team was: * Goalkeeper - Blackmore * Backs - Newman and Caley * Half-backs - Cochrane, Manning (captain), Alcock * Forwards - Marshall, Stewart, Hope, Thomas & McBeth The officials for the game were Mr Priestly (referee) and Mr R Hatt (linesman). 1932 ‚Äì First Lismore Club & Competition The first Lismore club (it's possible that the Lismore Athletic Soccer Club of 1914 was a team only) was established in April 1932 at a meeting at the Golden Globe rooms.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94281767 At that meeting, it was noted the club had 34 players and \\"the support of prominent Lismore citizens, including representatives of two churches\\"; Canon Moore (Church of England) and Reverend Parker (Presbyterian). The club adopted club colours of red and blue shirts and white shorts, and decided to enter a team in Bangalow's Association premiership competition that was initially supposed to include 6 teams: * Bangalow (2 teams) * McLeans Ridges * Federal * Mullumbimby * Lismore Only 3 teams nominated for the initial competition of the Northern Rivers Soccer Football Association with additional teams from Lismore, Ballina and McLeans Ridges being invited to compete in the end of season knockout competitionhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94284494https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94284477: * Bangalow Rangers * Lismore AFC * Federal In May 1932 Lismore announced they had rented \\"An area of land at the corner of Diadem and Magellan streets\\" for use as a home ground.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94284251 The first game in the competition was played at Bangalow on Saturday, 14th May 1932 with Bangalow defeating Lismore 3-1.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94283825 The teams were: * Bangalow: Morrison, Graham, Hunt, Ramsden, W Turner, Macdonald, Jeffert, A Carter, Davies, Eldridge, J Carter * Lismore: Fender, Williamson, Green, Daly, Holmes, Gilmour, Kinch, G Wightman, McCredie, Simpson, Temperley New clubs were formed in Lismore in Mayand Casino in July 1932.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94290452 The new Lismore club was probably called Lismore City.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94289800 In July 1932 an Association Cup competition attracted 6 teams: Bangalow, Lismore City, Casino, Dyraaba, Lismore & Federal.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/94293339 Le Clare Cup Football continued being played on a social basis and then on a more organised basis for the Le Clare Cup until 1939. 1949 Revival Association Football in the Lismore district was revived after a 10-year hiatus in early 1949 by Constable Ossie (Oscar) Pomroy, a local policeman and Jack Connolly, a repatriation representative. Pomroy had played association football with the Police team in the Sydney competition. On Saturday 30 April 1949 the first competition game for 1949 was played at Lismore Recreation Ground between two under-16 teams; Brisbane Telegraph Rangers and Lismore Boys‚Äô Hostel. In May 1949 a club was formed in Casino. The first senior game of the season was played at Lismore Recreation Ground on Saturday 28 May between a Lismore team and a Casino team with Lismore winning 4-1. The Casino team featured former Dutch international, Jack Dalmeyer. In June 1949 the Lismore and District Soccer Football Association, a predecessor to the current Football Far North Coast, was formed. The inaugural office bearers were: * Patrons: Larry Anthony, Commonwealth member for Richmond and William Frith, NSW member for Lismore * President: Maurice Guilmant * Vice-Presidents: R Hatt, C Lawman, J Robertson, Frank Oakes, Clarrie Richards, Ossie Pomroy, RM Frazer * Secretary: RT McBain * Treasurer: GJ Wightman * Publicity Officer: Ossie Pomroy The under-16 competition played for the Wilcher Cup donated by Wilcher's Dye Works of Keen Street, Lismore with 12 teams from 7 clubs competing: *1. North Lismore ‚Äì Hotspurs, Thistle *2. East Lismore ‚Äì Rovers, Athletic *3. South Lismore ‚Äì Celtic, Albion *4. Hostel ‚Äì United, Wanderers *5. Goonellabah Stars *6. Telegraph Rangers *7. City Rangers North Lismore Hotspurs were the inaugural winners of the Wilcher Cup with South Lismore Celtic winning the junior cup final. In seniors 5 teams participated in the competition: *1. Lismore City *2. North Lismore Marauders *3. Goonellabah Gold Stars *4. Methodist OK *5. Casino Rebels Lismore City were the winners of the Challenge Cup which appears to have been the equivalent of the grand final, beating Casino 5‚Äì1 in the final. In September 1949 a Far North Coast representative team played Corinthians, the 1949 Brisbane soccer premiers. The game was played at Lismore Recreation Grounds, with Corinthians winning 7‚Äì1. 1950 ‚Äì Formation of Eastwood Unitedhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/99074665 At a meeting in February 1950 Eastwood United was established comprising 2 junior teams (Under 14 and 18) and 1 senior team. It was agreed that club colours would be red shirts with white collars, pockets and sleeves, white shorts and red and white socks. The inaugural elected officials were: * Patron ‚Äì Dr RE Longworth * President ‚Äì Mr M (Maurice) Guilmant * Secretary ‚Äì Mr M Glendinning * Assistant Secretary ‚Äì Mr E Wells * Treasurer ‚Äì Mr J Harrison * Publicity Officer ‚Äì Mr OH (Ossie) Pomroy 1950 Brand Cup Final (Casino Rebels Win the Final But Not the Cup!) The 1950 Arthur Brand Cup Final between Eastwood United and Casino Rebels was played on Saturday, 9 September at the Lismore Recreation Ground (Recreation Ground Number 1). The game was of a high standard with Eastwood United winning 2‚Äì1 after extra time and being presented with the cup by Arthur Brand. Casino Rebels protested the result to the Lismore District Soccer Football Association (LDSFA) on the grounds that the refereeing of Mr Des Hyde had not been up to standard, and demanded a replay. In particular, it was reported Casino Rebels players 'began to leave the field when a goal ... (by their captain, Stan Pendrigh) ... was disallowed' and the legitimacy of Eastwood United's winning goal which had been scored direct from an indirect free-kick. The LDSFA upheld (supported) Casino Rebels protest and directed the final be replayed at Casino on Saturday, 23 September. Mr Stan Jarrett, the Secretary of the LDSFA resigned in protest at the decision. Eastwood United refused to play the re-match so the matter was referred to the NSW Soccer Association. The re-match was eventually played at Casino on Saturday 30 September with Casino Rebels winning 2‚Äì0. The NSW Soccer Association ruled the 'referee's decision was final' (in relation to the first game) and as a consequence, the LDSFA decided Eastwood United would hold the cup for the next 12 months. So whilst Casino Rebels won the 1950 Brand Cup Final, Eastwood United had possession of the cup. The Casino Rebels team for the re-match was: * A Morgan (Goalkeeper), Stan Pendrigh (Captain), Jack Dalmeyer, L Fryer, G Snow, W Richardson, M De Haan, H Johns, F Koning, M Day, J Davy, J McElligott The Eastwood United squad for the re-match was: * H Pogulis (Goalkeeper), Jim Brady, S De Vries, Billy Stark, Ossie Pomroy (Captain), Billy Driver, L Moller, Bill Woolnough, J Docherty, J Felicia, N Manitta, Cliff Burrows, M Nutt, N Garrett 1951 Brand Cup Final 'the longest match in history ...' The Brand Cup donated by Arthur Brand, a local pharmacist, was an end-of- season competition played on a knock-out basis. The 1951 Brand Cup final was between North Lismore Marauders and Methodist United. The first game, played on Saturday 25 August, was abandoned at 5:45 pm due to bad light after more than 2 hours play. The teams had played 90 minutes of normal time, and 2 sets of 20 minutes extra time. The score was 2-all at full time and 2-all when the game was abandoned. Goalscorers for North Lismore Marauders were S Miles and Cyril Mayo, whilst A Watson scored both goals for Methodist United. The game attracted more than 1,000 and possibly up to 1,500 fans with gate proceeds of more than 100 pounds being donated to the North Coast Children's Home. The replay was played on Saturday 15 September. Both clubs made changes with North Lismore Marauders bringing in forwards Dirk Brouwer and Bill Owens, and Methodist United including local baseball star Reg Baxter. Owens, who had been called up for army training was given special leave to play and flown in specially for the game. North Lismore Marauders won the replay 3‚Äì1 and their only-ever trophy in Lismore football history. Goalscorers for North Lismore Marauders were ironically, Bill Owens (2) and Dirk Brouwer, whilst Allan Halls scored for Methodist United. 1951 ‚Äì Establishment of Breakaway Casino District Soccer Association In March 1951 following a decision by the Lismore District Soccer Association to limit its boundaries to a radius of 25 miles from the Lismore Post Office, there were murmurings of a breakaway association centred on Casino. The proposed new association would encompass juniors and up to 7 senior teams: Casino (2), Bonalbo (2), Mallanganee, Dyraaba and Kyogle.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/96554572 1954 ‚Äì Drowning of LDSA Secretary, Cliff Burrows In July 1950 the Caledonians club from Brisbane visited Lismore to play the Far North Coast representative side. Cliff Burrows, a member of the Caledonians side was so impressed by Lismore that he returned to live there. Burrows, originally from the Leeds area in England, played for Eastwood United from 1950 to 1953 and was captain of the Church of Christ Crusaders side in 1954. Burrows was good enough to play for the Lismore City and Lismore representative sides against the Sutherland Shire Casuals and Grafton in 1954. Burrows also refereed. In June 1954 Burrows was elected Secretary of the Lismore District Soccer Association (LDSA) following the resignation of Mr Allan Halls. In September the same year, tragedy struck when Burrows drowned whilst surfing at Ballina Lighthouse Beach. Burrows was buried at Lismore Memorial Gardens on Skyline Road, Goonellabah.https://www.lismore.nsw.gov.au/apps/crem/search.asp The LDSA opened a fund to condition his grave and provide a suitable epitaph. In September 1955 a memorial was unveiled at Burrows' grave.Northern Star, 19 September 1955 1957 ‚Äì Visit by Eastern Athletic (Hong Kong) In July 1957 a team described in the local press as the Chinese national team but actually Eastern Athletic from Hong Kong visited Lismore to play a Lismore District Soccer Association XI.http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Socceroo/1957B.html This was the first time an International or State side had visited the Northern Rivers region of NSW.Northern Star, 22 July 1957 Eastern Athletic were a good side; in the week before playing the Lismore XI they drew 2-all with Australia and beat Queensland 5‚Äì3 in Brisbane.Northern Star, 25 July 1957 The week leading up to the game was marred by injury. Firstly, the referee assigned to the game, Allan Halls from Lismore, was concussed in a car accident and there was some doubt he would take charge of the match. Secondly, Bill Smith the captain and central defender of the Lismore XI was injured playing for his club, Eastwood United the weekend before the game, and forced to withdraw.Northern Star, 27 July 1957 Bill Mullins of Grafton replaced Smith as captain.

According to the local newspaper the best players for the Lismore XI were R Parkhouse, Bill Mullins, Eric Moss (the youngest player in the team at 17 years of age), Charlie Kostic & L Orchard. The Lismore XI, selected from the Lismore region and including players from Grafton and Casino was: * R Parkhouse (Grafton, Goalkeeper), Gary Kuehne (Grafton), Bill Mullins (Grafton, Captain), Eric Moss (Grafton), Charlie Kostic (Grafton), L Orchard (Eastwood United, Lismore), Barry Neaves (Eastwood United, Lismore), B McPherson (Goonellabah Stars, Lismore), A Lee (Goonellabah Stars, Lismore), W van Beers (Casino) and F Laing (Grafton) The match officials were: * Referee - Allan Halls * Linesmen - K Goudie, G Hayward Eastern Athletic exists to this day, re-badged as Eastern Sports Club and currently playing in the Hong Kong Premier League. 1958 ‚Äì Formation of Lismore Thistles On Friday 31 January 1958 a meeting was held at the Boy's Hostel in Lismore to form a new club to play in Lismore & District Soccer Football Association competitions.

Harris' motivation was to \\"foster younger players ... create more interest in the code by expanding the competition, which he saw as lopsided due to Goonellabah Stars dominance\\".Northern Star, 18 November 1992 Harris was a former Irish schoolboy representative and English 1st Division player who had moved to Lismore in 1957 via Melbourne (where he played for Slavia).

In 1982 they came 2nd last in First Division. 1983 would be a break-out year as they won the ANZAC Cup and 1st Division premiership for the first time with virtually the same team as 1982. In April Goonellabah won their first ANZAC Cup 1-0 against Eastwood United with Robert Pearce scoring with full-time looming. The 1983 premiership was a season-long race between Goonellabah and the defending premiers Eastwood United. Going into the final round the Armin Sandmann coached Goonellabah led by 2 points needing a win against 3rd-placed Lismore Thistles to be certain of their first premiership. Goonellabah won 1-0 (goalscorer - Andy Acton) making Eastwood United's 9-1 thrashing of South Lismore inconsequential. Eastwood United had revenge when they defeated Goonellabah 3-0 in the major semi-final, the goalscorers being John Wraights, Ken McPherson and Dennis Wiblen. Goonellabah's season came to an end when beaten 1-0 by Lismore Thistles in the preliminary final, the goalscorer being Neil Harris. The Jack Jarvis coached Eastwood United won their 8th grand final defeating Lismore Thistles 2-0 at a windy Oakes Oval, the goalscorers being Darren Laycock and John Wraights. {  - ! Position !!

In addition two Lismore-based clubs, Italo Stars and South Lismore merged to create a new club, Souths Stars United. Souths Stars United had immediate success, winning the 1984 ANZAC Cup and First Division premiership. In the ANZAC Cup Souths Stars United defeated Eastwood United 2-1 at Oakes Oval in front of 400 fans and after almost 2 hours of play. Midway through the first half Souths Stars United's Brett Towner pounced on a defensive mix-up to give Souths Stars a 1-0 half-time lead. Eastwood United equalised late in the second half thanks to a Ken McPherson penalty, making it 1-all at full-time. In the first period of extra-time Kevin Wilson headed home the winner to clinch the trophy. Man of the match, selected by referee Dean Mohammed and linesmen Dick Morrissey and Ted Cavanagh, was Brett Towner of Souths Stars United. The First Division premiership was a two-club race between Souths Stars United and Eastwood United with Souths Stars taking out the trophy by 3 points: {  - ! Position !! Club !! Played !! Won !!

However, in 1985 Lismore Workers came second to undefeated premiers Lismore Thistles and made the grand final against Lismore Thistles after a new and confusing finals format in which the top 6 teams played 4 semi-final rounds.

These were their 2nd premiership (the first was in 1975) and 3rd championship (previous championships were in 1964 and 1975). Richmond Rovers was established by Bill Harris in 1961 and in their first season fielded 3 teams; a senior men's team and 2 junior teams. By 1986 Richmond Rovers had grown to 22 teams; 5 men's teams, 2 women's teams and 15 junior teams.

This game was played as a curtain-raiser to a pre-season Ericcson Cup (National Soccer League) game between Brisbane Strikers and Marconi which attracted more than 5,000 fans. In the major semi-final at Weston Park, Casino defeated Lismore Workers 1-0 with a first half goal by Dave Hood, and made history by reaching their first ever grand final. Lismore Workers reached the grand final after defeating Goonellabah 1-0 in the preliminary final after a 108th minute extra time goal by Glen Gilchrist. The grand final between Casino and Lismore Workers was played at a water-logged Oakes Oval. A wild storm including rain, wind and thunder forced the players off the field after 10 minutes of play. After a 40-minute break the players returned to a drenched surface. Casino scored first when sweeper Stewart Coughran drove a free-kick from just outside the penalty box, around the wall and past goalkeeper Justin Marks. Soon after scoring Coughran was stretchered off with an ankle injury, briefly returned but was substituted before half-time and played no further part in the game. With 15 minutes remaining Paul Wiltshire made it 2-0 to Casino when he scored with a \\"venomous\\" shot from 20 metres. With 5 minutes to go Lismore Workers scored with a Brad Bosworth headed goal from a corner. But Casino held on to win the grand final 2-1. The player of the match was Casino's Wayne Mortimer.

A crowd of more than 3,000 saw the Chinese team win 3-0 with the 3 first half goals, the goalscorers being Shui Qingxia, Sun Qingmei and Zhao Lihong. The local press were glowing of the Chinese team ... their \\"silken touch, ... superb ball skills, such a desire to be the best\\". The game was historic because it was the first game China had played in Australia, and for the inclusion of Lismore local Lisa Casagrande in the Australian team. Unfortunately Casagrande was replaced late in the first half due to calf cramps. In the curtain-raiser the Soccer Far North Coast Under-16 girls team defeated the Coffs Harbour Under-16 girls team 4-1. Goalscorers for Soccer Far North Coast were Martene Edwards (2), Amy Brown and Olivia Brisby with Katrina Byrnes scoring for Coffs Harbour.

In April Byron Bay won the ANZAC Shield beating Richmond Rovers 2-1 in the final at Oakes Oval. Aaron Walker scored both goals for Byron Bay before being sent-off in the 89th minute, whilst Kurt Walker scored for Richmond Rovers in the 65th minute.https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-northern- star/20170424/282084866687935 Joel Wood of Byron Bay was named player of the match. Byron Bay won the premiership by 2 points from Richmond Rovers, losing only once during the season, a round 17 home loss to Richmond Rovers 1-2. This defeat meant that Byron Bay had to win their final fixture away to Alstonville to secure the premiership. A 5-2 win ensured Byron Bay's 4th premiership. The Cyril Mayo Cup (grand final) between Byron Bay and defending champions Bangalow was history-making, being contested for the first time ever by 2 clubs from the Byron Shire. It was also the first time since 2001 that both grand finalists were from outside Lismore (in 2001 Maclean defeated Byron Bay in the Cyril Mayo Cup final).https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/the-battle- of-byron-shire-in-soccer-grand-final/3224526/ And for the first time since 2009 when the grand final was played at Crozier Field; the grand final wasn't played at Oakes Oval due to refurbishments. The game was played at Lismore Workers' home ground, Richards Oval in Lismore. A 10-man Byron Bay won the grand final 2-1 after Ben Ahearn was sent off in the 16th minute and extra time thanks to a double by player-of-the match Joel Wood.https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/ramming-it-home-in-soccer-grand- final/3224916/ {  - !

Going into that final fixture Ballina led South Lismore by 2 points and draw or win would have been enough for Ballina to be promoted. However goals by Kaine Allan (2) and Steve Morrissey in response to a Ben Coulter goal for Ballina gave South Lismore the win and the premiership. South Lismore won the premiership-grand final double by beating Shores United 3-1 in the grand final. South Lismore would be playing in the top division of FFNC competitions for the first time since 2002. South Lismore's 1st Division double was a triumph for their young coach, Cameron Hyde, who overcame a cancer diagnosis to guide his young team back into the Premier Division.https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/kicking-goals-after-cancer- battle/3266176/ 2018 ‚Äì Lismore Workers & Italo Stars Depart the Premier Division The 2018 season began with the sad realisation that the 2 most successful clubs in FFNC history, Lismore Workers and Italo Stars, would not be competing in Premier Division. Italo Stars were relegated to 1st Division after coming bottom in the 2017 Premier Division competition whilst Lismore Workers voluntarily opted to play in the Men's lower divisions. Between them Lismore Workers (46 titles, 28 as Eastwood United and 18 as Lismore Workers) and Italo Stars (33 titles) have won 79 titles. Lismore Workers dropped 5 divisions to Division 5 whilst Italo Stars went back 1 division to 1st Division. South Lismore returned to the Premier Division in 2018 after a 16-year absence after winning the 2017 1st Division premiership-grand final double. With the return of South Lismore, the self-demotion of Lismore Workers and the relegation of Italo Stars, the 2018 Premier Division competition has 9 clubs, a change from the tradition of 10 or even 12 clubs. In April Lismore Thistles won their 3rd ANZAC Cup in 6 years and their 8th overall, beating Bangalow 3-0 at Crozier Field.

This was their second trophy in FFNC history following their 2016 Cyril Mayo Cup triumph. Sam Ireland scored the winner for Bangalow in extra time after it was 1-1 at full-time. Goalscorers during normal time were Byron Milne for Bangalow and Ian McKellow for Byron Bay. The 2019 Premier Division competition kicked off with just 8 clubs including a promoted Ballina which was found to be uncompetitive, losing all 21 games. Byron Bay won their 5th premiership at Nielson Park, East Lismore on a Wednesday night in August when they thrashed a disappointing Richmond Rovers 5-0 in a catch-up game. Byron Bay came from 2nd last after 5 rounds to win their 4th premiership in 6 seasons, winning 14 and losing just 2 of their final 16 fixtures. South Lismore came second in the premiership but made amends by winning the Cyril Mayo Cup for the first time since their premiership-Cyril Mayo Cup double in 1993. South Lismore defeated premiers Byron Bay 2-1 with Noah Coleman scoring twice for South Lismore and winning the Terry Greedy medal for the player of the match. The grand final marked the end of an era with Damon Bell, the Byron Bay coach announcing his retirement during grand final week. During Bell's highly-successful 7-year reign Byron Bay won: * 4 Premier League premierships * 3 Cyril Mayo Cups (for winning the grand final) * 1 ANZAC Cup * the treble (ANZAC Cup, premiership and Cyril Mayo Cup (grand final)) in 2018 In August FFNC flagged changes to the structure of senior competitions in 2020 aimed at re-invigorating and removing constraints at the top levelshttps://www.nbnnews.com.au/2019/08/14/major-shake-up-for-football-far- north-coast/: * Men's Premier Division to be re-branded as Men's Premier League * Women's Premier Division to be re-branded as Women's Premier League * Men's Premier Reserves to be re-branded as the Championship League The 2020 Men's Premier League will have 9 teams including the yet to be confirmed return of Maclean. 2019 - Premier Division Final Tablehttp://websites.sportstg.com/comp_info.cgi?a=LADDER&compID;=520721&c;=1-8226-0-0-0 & Cyril Mayo Cup {  - !

This carnival featured athletics, cycling, woodchopping, national dancing, rugby league and soccer. The ANZAC Cup was donated in 1949 by the Lismore RSL. The inaugural ANZAC Cup kicked off at 8-30pm between Methodist United and North Lismore Marauders.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/99081051 In an \\"evenly contested\\" game played under \\"inadequate lighting\\" Methodist United won 1 - 0 thanks to a goal by M Bell. The teams and officials for the inaugural ANZAC Cup were: * Methodist United - M Santin (Goalkeeper), R Hill, K Stevenson, L Morley (?), Stan Pendrigh, George Chalmers (Captain-Coach), Fryer, M Bell, H Forster, Jack Dalmeyer, G Barnes * North Lismore Marauders - E Morgan (Goalkeeper), G Rogers (Captain), L Bryant, J Brady, Ossie Pomroy, H McDonald, J Docherty, Bill Driver, Bill Woolnough, R Bowen & K Matteson. Reserves - A Wakley, A Parker, G Kennedy, A Woolnough, A Manitta * Referee - Clarrie Richards * Linesmen - Jim Gooch, Charlie Thompson In the early years the Cup was played between the Cup holders and a challenger decided by ballot. The Cup holders only had to draw to retain the Cup. For example, in 1951 the Cup holders Methodist United drew 3‚Äì3 all with the challengers Eastwood United, and retained the Cup. The date of the Cup also varied in the early years due to \\"inadequate lighting facilities\\" although it's now played on ANZAC Day or the weekend before or after ANZAC Day and usually at Oakes Oval, Lismore. The record for the most ANZAC Cup wins is held by Lismore Workers with 19 (including 9 as Eastwood United). However, the record for the most consecutive wins is held by Italo Stars which won the renamed ANZAC Shield for 9 consecutive years from 1973 to 1981 including 6 wins over the luckless Eastwood United: * 1973 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 3 (Andy Stevens, Gordon Bryant, Kevin Watts) - Eastwood United 0 * 1974 at Nielson Park - Italo Stars 1 (Mick Stevens) - Lismore Thistles 0 * 1975 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 0 - Eastwood United 0 (Italo Stars retained the Shield as holders) * 1976 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 4 (scorers unknown) - Eastwood United 0 * 1977 at Nielson Park - Italo Stars 3 (Gary Northcote, Greg Sharpe (2)) - Eastwood United 1 (Gerrard Pollard) * 1978 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 1 (Peter Jenson) - Goonellabah 0 * 1979 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 3 (Rod Dargie, John Essex (2)) - Goonellabah 3 (Ian McDonald, Rodney Eather, Steven Hapgood) (Italo Stars retained the Shield as holders) * 1980 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 2 - Eastwood United 2 (Italo Stars retained the Shield as holders) * 1981 at Oakes Oval - Italo Stars 3 - Eastwood United 1 Special mention to the powerful Goonellabah Stars side of the 1950s which won their first ANZAC Cup in 1952 and then won it for the next 5 years: * 1952 at Recreation Ground Number 3 \\\\- Goonellabah Stars 4 (K Packham (2), R McDermott (2)) - Methodist United 2 (R Hill, J Parker) * 1953 at Oakes Oval - Goonellabah Stars 4 (R McDermott, B McPherson (2), J Teale) - Church of Christ Crusaders 0 * 1954 at Nielson Park - Goonellabah Stars 7 (N Manitta (3), J Wraight (2), R Minarelli, K McDermott) - Methodist United 1 (M Marsh) * 1955 at Oakes Oval - Goonellabah Stars 5 (Nino Manitta, Ben Neilson (2), Ken Eastment (2)) - Church of Christ Crusaders 2 (Ross Reid, Warren Taber)The Northern Star, 1 September 1955The Northern Star, 5 September 1955 * 1956 at Oakes Oval - Goonellabah Stars 3 (Ben Nielson (2 including a penalty), Pomfret) - Eastwood United 1 (Hodgkinson)The Northern Star, 2 July 1956 * 1957 at Recreation Ground Number 10 - Goonellabah Stars defeated Internationals (No details available)The Northern Star, 3 September 1957 Cyril Mayo Cup (from 1958) Cyril Mayo emigrated from England as a 17-year old in the early 1900s and settled in the North Rivers region. Cyril was a competent player for North Lismore and after his playing days took up refereeing. Tragically Cyril was killed in a car crash in 1957. Cyril's wife Lucy commissioned a trophy to remember Cyril's contribution to the game, the Cyril Mayo Cup which has \\"become the most sought after piece of silverware in local soccer\\". The cup is awarded to the highest Men's Division grand final winner's also known as Champions. It was first awarded in 1958 to Goonellabah Stars following their 1 - 0 win over Eastwood United at Oakes Oval, Lismore. Ben Nielson was Goonellabah Star's goalscorer.The Northern Star, 11 August 1958 The cup was originally called the Cyril Mayo Memorial Challenge Cup but in more recent times has been referred to simply and affectionately as \\"Cyril\\". Most Consecutive Cyril Mayo Cup Wins The record for the most number of consecutive Cyril Mayo Cup wins is 5 and is jointly held by: * Lismore Thistles - 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974 * Italo Stars - 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981 Callan McMillan Memorial Shield (from 1978)https://www.echonews.com.au/news/grand-lady-presents-shield/790471/ In 1972 a young Scotsman Callan McMillan Junior left the country of his birth headed for Australia where he eventually settled in Lismore. An avid Glasgow Rangers supporter, Callan was soon involved in local football as a coach and member of the inaugural Far North Coast Amateur Soccer Association Committee in 1977. Tragedy struck in December 1977 when Callan Junior drowned whilst trying to save a young girl. The local football community rallied to support Callan's family, and in 1978 the Callan McMillan Memorial Shield was struck to commemorate his contribution to the local game. The shield was presented to the winner of the women's knock-out competition. In 1996 when the North Coast Women's Soccer Association and the Lismore District Soccer Association amalgamated, it was agreed that the shield be incorporated with the men's ANZAC Cup/Shield knockout competition held on ANZAC day.

As of 2010 one creation is extant while one is dormant. The Burnett Baronetcy, of Leys in the County of Kincardine, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 21 April 1626 for the leading Covenanter Thomas Burnett. He was the uncle of Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury. The third Baronet was one of the Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain. The eighth, tenth and twelfth Baronets all served as Lord Lieutenant of Kincardineshire. The thirteenth Baronet was a Major-General in the British Army. The title became dormant on the death of the fourteenth Baronet in 1959. The sixth Baronet married Catherine, sister and heiress of Sir Alexander Ramsay-Irvine, 6th and last Baronet, of Balmain (see Ramsay Baronets). Their second son Alexander Burnett succeeded to the Ramsay estates on his uncle's death in 1806 and assumed the surname of Ramsay in lieu of his patronymic. The same year the baronetcy of Balmain was revived in his favour. His descendant Sir Alexander William Burnett Ramsay, 7th Baronet, is presumed to be the heir to the Burnett Baronetcy of Leys. The Burnett Baronetcy, of Selborne House in the County Borough of Croydon, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 17 October 1913 for Sir David Burnett, Lord Mayor of London between 1912 and 1913. As of 2010 the title is held by his great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, who succeeded his father in 2002.

The title of Baronet passes only through the male line, so the heir to the Baronetcy of Burnett of Leys is Alexander William Burnett Ramsay, who lives in Australia.

Gallagher. By exploring, arranging, and commissioning music for guitar, keyboard, drums, and bass, the group mixes classical and rock music in a genre that has been described as Art rock, Experimental Music, Avant-Progressive, or Avant-Rock. Electric Kompany has performed in the New York City area and was one of the featured bands at Full Force: The New Rock Complexity, a festival curated by Gallagher and John Zorn. Current members * Kevin R. Gallagher - guitar * Alex Walker - bass * James Johnston - keyboard * Eric Poland - drums History Electric Kompany was founded by Kevin R. Gallagher, a guitarist who spent much of his career as a competition-winning classical guitarist who performed all around the world. In 2001, Gallagher began improvising and arranging music for electric guitar from composers such as J.S. Bach and Rob Haskins and soon began holding auditions for the group that would become Electric Kompany. His mission was to launch a group that combined the classical and popular music worlds. \\"I can't say there were any obvious influences for the group,\\" says Gallagher. \\"It's just me coming to terms with who I am - a mix of a classical and rock musician. I can perform rock music or classical music fluently, but I never felt totally satisfied in either world.\\" Since Electric Kompany began performing, they have arranged music by Nick Didkovsky, Marc Mellits, and Jacob Ter Veldhuis, and have commissioned music by David Laganella and Kristen Hevner. They have a performance schedule that includes many concerts in the New York City area and have been a featured band at Full Force: The New Rock Complexity. Mission statement The mission statement of Electric Kompany states that \\"at this time in music history, composers are freely combining Avant-garde and American popular music aesthetics. This new 'Avant - Pop' music is daring, exciting, even shocking. However, most composers are writing this 'new' music for 'old' instruments. As beautiful as these kinds of pieces are, there still is a tremendous lack of 'modern music' written for 'modern instruments' - in our case - the electric guitar, keyboards, drum set, and electric bass. This seems to be the next logical step in music evolution and is the main reason for the formation of the rock quartet, Electric Kompany.\\" Discography References * http://www.sequenza21.com/2006/04/electric-kompany-may-21-7pm-in-nyc.html * Dickenson, J.

Batalik is 56 km from Kargil and is known for its four Brokpa villages: Dah, Hanu, Garkon, Chulichan, Sharchay and Darchak.

Glendowie suburb was established in the 1920s when George Riddell created a loop road in the area. The owner of the rural blocks of land in the centre of the loop combined them to form a golf course, which later became Churchill Park.

The mansion served as the London residence of the Marquesses of Londonderry. It remained their home until 1962. In that year Londonderry House was sold by the Trustees of the 7th Marquess of Londonderry's Will Trusts to a developer who built the \\"Londonderry Hotel\\" on the site, not (as is sometimes, erroneously, stated) the Hilton. The Hilton Hotel is on the other side of the street, and had already been opened. COMO Metropolitan London now occupies the site of Londonderry House. History The library, 1920s Holdernesse House, later Londonderry House, was designed by Athenian Stuart for Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness in the period c. 1760‚Äì5, with ceilings based on Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra. The Earl is thought to have acquired the building next door as well, but at a later date. He subsequently joined the two so that the house became a double-fronted London mansion. The residence was purchased in 1819 by the 1st Baron Stewart, an Irish aristocrat, to serve as a home whilst the family stayed in London during the annual social season. Soon after the purchase, he began redecorating and spared no expense, as shown by his choice of architects: Benjamin Dean Wyatt and Philip Wyatt. In 1822, Lord Stewart became the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. By 1835, the home's transformation was complete. Some half a century later, in 1882‚Äì83, the 5th Marquess commissioned James Brooks to build, in red brick with terracotta facings, a handsome new stable yard, coach houses, and accommodation for the stable staff of Londonderry House, arranged around an internal courtyard (all of which were accessible via wide double doors opening on to Brick Street). Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (later Napoleon III) often visited Londonderry House while exiled in London in 1836-40 and 1846‚Äì48. During World War I, the house was used as a military hospital. After the war, Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, and his wife, Edith Helen Chaplin, continued to use the house and entertained extensively. After World War II, the house remained in the possession of the 7th Marquess of Londonderry with the Royal Aero Club leasing most of Londonderry House, though the family retained twenty two rooms for their own use. Following the death of the 7th Marquess in 1949, his widow Edith continued in occupation by permission of the Trustees of her late husband's Will, until her death in 1959. The Londonderry age on Park Lane drew to a close after the death of Edith, Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry. The last social events hosted by the family in Londonderry House were the debutante balls of Hon Elizabeth Keppel in 1959 [5] [Source reference 5: See Durham County Record Office Catalogue reference entry D/X 2183 \\"Records Relating to Hon Elizabeth Keppel\\" : D/X 2183/1 \\"Thank you letters sent to Lady Mairi Bury from guests who attended a ball at Londonderry House, London, to celebrate Elizabeth's 18th birthday, 23 October-2 November 1959\\"] and Hon Rose Keppel in 1961, hosted by their mother Lady Mairi Bury (youngest daughter of the 7th Marquess); the wedding reception of Hon Elizabeth Keppel, following her marriage to her cousin Alastair Villiers in June 1962, and a subsequent, final, \\"farewell\\" party given by Alastair, 9th Marquess later in the year. Retrenchment saw Londonderry House sold in 1962 with the Londonderry Trustees receiving a sale consideration of ¬£500,000 in 1962 money. The \\"Londonderry Silver\\" was mostly bought by the Brighton council for the Royal Pavilion, where it can currently be seen, along with the Ormonde silver. The large statue at the foot of the staircase of Londonderry House, Canova's \\"Theseus and the Minotaur\\", was bought by the Victoria & Albert Museum. George Stubbs's masterpiece, the life-size painting of the racehorse Hambletonian after his famous win at Newmarket, was one of the items which belonged to Lady Mairi Bury and it was taken down from the library in Londonderry House and rehung on the staircase of Lady Mairi's own home at Mount Stewart, in County Down, where it is still to be seen today. Description The main stairway (upstairs), 1920s The drawing room, 1920s The tragedy of the sale of Londonderry House was not the comparatively meagre price (by current standards) it fetched for the Londonderry family, but the fact that this magnificent mansion was then immediately, apart from its stableyard (which still stands, with its separate entrance in Brick Street still surmounted by the coronet of a Marquess), completely demolished. The bland exterior of Londonderry House concealed, for example, the aforementioned magnificently painted, and fresco-ceiling interiors by James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart who had, coincidentally, built the Temple of the Winds at the Londonderry's Ulster seat of Mount Stewart. The main stairway was meant to outdo that of Lancaster House in nearby St James's. It succeeded in this: it had a large skylight, Rococo chandelier and two individual flights of stairs flanking each other. This stairway led into the Grand Ballroom which, rather individually, held full-length portraits of the Stewart family men in Garter Robes, by artists such as Sir Thomas Lawrence (who painted the 2nd Marquess) and Glyn Philpot (who depicted the 7th Marquess). Said to have been inspired by the Waterloo Chamber of Apsley House, it also outdid that. Around the room were large marble statues including by Canova and chairs in the French style. On from that was the Dining Room, which held the Londonderry collection of silver. Another elegant room was the tripartite Drawing Room, which held more Londonderry Silver, French furniture, Old Master paintings (for example \\"The Madonna and Child with a male Donor, a landscape beyond\\", painted by Giovanni Bellini, which was sold by Lady Mairi Bury in 1977, to provide a capital sum endowment for the National Trust to become involved with the care of Mount Stewart), and ceilings painted with birds.

Notable entrants included Ivan Leonidov, Konstantin Melnikov, Vesnin brothers and Ivan Fomin. The site NKTP was supposed to take up the site of historical Kitai-gorod, the territory directly north and east from Red Square. The Square was to be widened (into the site of State Universal Store) and part of Zaryadye. State Historical Museum, Kazan Cathedral, and Lenin Museum (Moscow City Hall) were to be demolished. The building, spanning over 400 meters along the square, would have had its northern facade on Teatralnaya Square (then Sverdlov Square), southern fa√ßade on Moscow River, across Balchug Street. Building size was set at 40,000 square meters built-out area, 110,000 square meters usable floor area (comparison figures for contemporary Empire State Building: 8,100 and 200,000 square meters, respectively). The entries Contest entries clearly differentiated into classical (including postconstructivist), and avant-garde. A total of 120 entries were collected. Some were worthless, some were made just to fill the list. Most curious of this sort, by F. Karyakin (Red Square fa√ßade, plan), settled for no less than six half-scale replicas of Boris Iofan's Palace of Soviets tower. Serious concepts were produced by old Revival school architects and their young followers (class of 1929): Image:Ivan_Fomin_NKTP_Contest_Entry.jpgIvan Fomin, P.V. Abrosimov, M.A. Minkus. This is the shortest, northern facade. Ivan Fomin limited building height to 12 story (24 story for two towers facing Lenin's Mausoleum) to fit into existing technology limits. Ivan Leonidov's concept, consisting of three lean skyscrapers, probably the most advanced, was far beyond these limits. Constructivist elders Alexander Vesnin and Victor Vesnin produced various concepts: Note that in 1934 Victor Vesnin became the Chief Architect of Narkomtiazhprom (Ministry of Heavy Industry); Alexander Vesnin and Moisei Ginzburg also worked with this institution throughout the 1930s. Reality or Symbolism Whether the state (or Stalin personally) really intended to build this project is not clear. By 1934, feasibility studies for the Palace of Soviets identified the missing technologies that would take years to develop; skyscraper construction in 1934 was out of the question. The cost to relocate numerous government offices from Kitai-gorod would have been enormous, too. Modern theorists speculate that *the contest was just another attempt to formulate the vector of Stalinist architecture *or that it was a plot to separate the loyal, neoclassical architects from the stubborn avant-garde followers, and demote the latter. The 1935 Master plan of Moscow (–ì–µ–Ω–ø–ª–∞–Ω 1935) changed the concept, effectively voiding all contest entries. The square was to be widened, as set in 1934 contest terms, but the Narkomtiazhprom site was reduced to Zaryadye only (1/3 of original area). Construction in Zaryadye commenced in 1947 (see Moscow Skyscrapers), and was cancelled again in early 1950s. The site stood vacant for a decade. Rossiya Hotel was completed in 1967 and demolished in 2006-2007.

He is currently the senior assistant coach at A-League side Western United. Club career Anastasiadis began his career at Heidelberg United before being signed by the Greek club PAOK Thessaloniki FC at the age of 19. He made his debut in 1988 and became an influential part of the team, playing in 18 Alpha Ethniki matches, 5 cup games and 24 friendlies in the 1988/89 season, scoring 12 goals in total. He also took part in the club's brief 1990/91 and 1991/92 UEFA Cup campaigns. Anastasiadis played a total of 382 (203 league, 52 cup) matches and scored 66 (24 league, 3 cup) goals in his nine years at the club as a striker. Anastasiadis left PAOK in 1997 to return to Australia, where he joined NSL side South Melbourne FC. He played a key attacking role which helped the club to win back-to-back championships in the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons, scoring goals in both grand final victories: once in the 1997/98 final, past his brother Dean Anastasiadis who was in goal for Carlton; and two goals in the 1998/99 Grand Final against Sydney United as a substitute. He also represented the club at the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, scoring the team's only goal (and Australia's first in the tournament) of the competition against Mexican side Necaxa. He played his last professional game in the 2000/01 NSL grand final against the Wollongong Wolves, coming off the bench to score a goal, once again past his brother Dean who was in goal for the opposition. He finished his playing career fully in 2003 playing in the lower Victorian leagues with Yarraville Glory, as captain-coach. John Anastasiadis is an Honorary Life Member of Melbourne Club PAOK, The official PAOK Thessaloniki Supporters Club of Australia. Managerial career After retirement from playing, and with Yarraville relegated under his stewardship in 2003, he managed to get the side promoted back the next season. In 2005, with the return of South Melbourne to the Victorian Premier League after the disbandment of the NSL competition, Anastasiadis put his hand up for the job which few wanted. Despite taking charge of a young squad which was quickly assembled merely weeks before the start of the new season, and which was labelled as a relegation candidate at the start of the year, Anastasiadis led the side to 3rd place on the ladder at the end of the season and as far as the Preliminary Final, where the team lost 1-0 to Heidelberg United and was knocked out. It was an incredible achievement for Anastasiadis considering just three players turned up to his first training session at the club, one of which was his brother Dean. Retained as coach for the 2006 season, he led South Melbourne to victory in the Grand Final of the Vodafone Cup competition. After failing to make the finals in 2007, South's poor start in 2008 saw Anastasiadis resign. After three years at South, John moved to the Oakleigh Cannons where he would spend the next three seasons. Despite mixed results, players such as Ivan Franjic.

The company is headquartered in London and has offices in ten other countries, being spread across four continents. Truphone offers SIM- based GSM mobile services to both businesses and individuals, mobile phone calls and SMS recording services for businesses, remote SIM provisioning and related services, and has a customer base that includes more than 3,500 multinational enterprises in 196 countries.  History  Truphone (a trading name of Truphone Ltd, formerly Software Cellular Network Ltd) was founded in 2006 by James Tagg, Alexander Straub and Alistair Campbell. The company's core business focus is Truphone (launched as Truphone Local Anywhere in January 2010). It is a GSM SIM-based mobile service that provides bundles of minutes, text and data to business customers for use in an area of 66 countries. Truphone calls this group of countries Truphone World. Within this area is a group of countries the company calls the Truphone Zone. Here, the company has MVNO partnerships with local operators and offers customers additional local mobile phone numbers. This is so users‚Äô contacts can always reach them with a local call at a local rate. Truphone was originally formed to develop downloadable mobile VoIP applications for smartphones, using the integrated Wi-Fi connection on the device. These offered the ability to make free or low cost calls on the mobile device in areas where there is weak or no GSM coverage, and to send Instant Messages to other networks in partnership with the multi million dollar Air Voice Telecommunications Group. The first Truphone application released was for Nokia devices. This was followed by applications for Apple iPhone, BlackBerry smartphones, Apple iPod Touch, Android devices and a softphone application for desktop was launched in late 2010. Truphone's SIM based products are entirely separate from the Apps. In 2012, Truphone had announced the intention to combine the SIM and App accounts for customers in the future, but their App service has since been discontinued.  Funding  Truphone's main funding comes from Vollin Holdings Limited, Minden, Ranjan Telecom Investments Ltd, Manar Investment Group Ltd, Nikhanj Communications Ltd, Sadhna Investment Group Ltd, Patwardhan Investments Ltd, Somercourt Investments Ltd, Wellington Partners, Eden Ventures, Shandilya Group of Industries, Prajapati Investments Ltd, Burda Capital, Independent News and Media, Straub Ventures, and a number of high- net-worth individuals.

Currently this includes Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States. The company has built a mobile network with core network technology distributed across four continents. Truphone uses these local points of presence (POPs) to reduce the distance that mobile traffic has to travel. This reduces latency, improves data speeds and call quality. Truphone offers local rates for calls, texts and data through commercial arrangements with mobile network operators in 66 countries around the world. The company focuses mainly on the business marketplace, and also has a pre-pay SIM that comes with 1 phone number, additional numbers can be purchased for an extra monthly fee (currently $8/month). Business plans include 2 phone numbers as standard.  Geographical breakdown  * Truphone Zone Countries where Truphone customers can purchase additional phone numbers, includes: the US, UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Germany, Poland and Spain * Truphone World Countries where business users' bundles of minutes, texts and data can be used,includes: Albania, Andorra, Argentina, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, French Guiana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Guernsey, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Martinique, Mayotte, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Reunion Island, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vatican City * Other countries: Truphone network provides service with higher quality performance in over 220 countries.  Truphone Mobile Recording  In addition to the roaming service, Truphone offers mobile call and SMS recording service to financial institutions in the UK and USA to comply with the mobile recording legislation from the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act. The Truphone Mobile Recording service is delivered with its wholly owned subsidiary TruObsidian, an organisation created out of the acquisition of Obsidian Wireless by Truphone in 2012.  Features  * Local rates in multiple countries * Bundles of voice minutes, texts and data used across the 66 countries in Truphone World * Multiple Local Numbers on one mobile / SIM for the eight Truphone Zone countries * Smart CLI * Works in over 200 countries (As per the GSMA) * Call and SMS recording (Optional available for UK, USA, Hong Kong and Australia subscribers only)  Technology  Multi IMSI The Truphone SIM allows more than one mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) to be added onto the SIM, so a user can have a number for every country Truphone has an MVNO partnership with. Smart CLI The Smart Caller Line Identification (Smart CLI) technology ensures that the most appropriate number is displayed on the phone of the person the Truphone user is calling. Mobile recording Truphone‚Äôs voice and SMS recording is integrated within the network infrastructure. Recorded conversations can be stored in the cloud or within the financial institution's existing recording infrastructure. In September 2013, Truphone partnered with BT to market Truphone Mobile Recording service to help firms meet new financial market regulations in the US.  Partnerships and MVNO agreements  Truphone has MVNO agreements with operators in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States. It has additional bi-lateral roaming agreements in place with a wide range of operators around the world .  Global mobile network infrastructure  Truphone owns and manages its own core mobile technology. The core is connected to global distributed major points of presence using a dedicated high speed internet connection (IP/VPLS). International mobile traffic is routed through the nearest point of presence, this reduction in physical distance reduces call interference and latency, and increases data throughput. My Truphone App Truphone was the first carrier in the world to launch an eSIM enabled app in the APP store in November 2018. Known as my Truphone the app allows apple iPhone eSIM compatible to download a sim over the air mapped to the world‚Äôs famous Truphone‚Äôs travel plan. Truphone's old VoIP application (known as Truphone App), was a separate product to the Tru SIM, allowing users to make calls over the internet to landline and mobile phone contacts, and free calls to other Truphone App users. Customers were also able to instant message contacts on other networks, such as Skype or Windows Live on selected devices. The application also had additional user experience enhancements including: *‚Äòcall cost indicator‚Äô that advises the per minute cost before a call is placed *signal strength checker *photo led contacts book *instant Messaging The application was available as a free download and worked on the following devices: * Mobile devices: ** Apple iPhone, iPod touch, iPad; however, user reviews on Apple's App Store report that the Tru App does not work correctly with iOS 5. ** BlackBerry smartphones (calls via WI-FI for BB not supported) ** Mobile phones with Android OS ** Nokia smartphones * Desktops and laptops: ** Computers with Apple Mac OS, Windows and Linux The app was also in development for Windows Phone 8. Text messages could be sent from Tru app versions for the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Nokia; as well as Apple Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Note as of the release of TruApp version 5 (in October/November 2012), text messaging functionality was removed from the iOS app and TruApp for iPad was removed from the Apple App Store altogether. Tru App supported a range of calling methods: calls over wired or wireless internet on Windows, Mac and Linux. It supported calls over Wi-Fi, 3G and call-through, depending on the platform. Call-through was called Tru Anywhere, which used the local minutes of the user to connect the call to a local Tru server. The BlackBerry application from Tru uses this method of calling only. Truphone applications used the Session Initiation Protocol open standard, that competes with other VoIP standards such as UMA and proprietary protocols such as the Skype protocol. It has been suggested that internet- based communications could be used without fear of interception. Truphone maintained, however, that it is governed by and complies with the same 'lawful intercept' laws as every other telecommunications company. In September 2016, Truphone announced that the Truphone App would close on Monday, 21 November 2016. According to an email to its user base from Director of Service & Operations, Paula Booth, Truphone \\"took this hard decision to allow us focus on our core business\\".

The house used to be the family seat of the Vane-Tempest- Stewarts, Marquesses of Londonderry, an Anglo-Irish aristocratic dynasty, but it was sold in the 1980s. The house Designed by Philip Wyatt and built 1822-28, the entrance front has 13 bays with a 6-column giant Corinthian portico. The entrance hall resembles that of Mount Stewart, the family's estate in Northern Ireland. It has a coffered segmental tunnel vault with apses at both ends and in the middle. There was a large crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling. The main octagonal centre hall extends the full height of the house and has a dome with caryatids around it and a skylight. There is also a mirrored drawing room with a gilded and painted ceiling, and a vast ballroom similar to that of the family's London residence, Londonderry House. The family wing of the mansion was nicknamed the Duke's Wing as it was named after the Duke of Wellington and his visit. This side of the house also held the Duke's Gallery, where the family housed their famed art collection when not in London. Gardens Many statues adorn the grand entrance court outside the house/hotel and a wide path leading to an obelisk. This, high, commemorates the arranged visit of the national hero the Duke of Wellington, who also served as Prime Minister, to the house and the area in 1827. At its height in the 19th century, the Wynyard Estate occupied (28 km¬≤) in Teesside. The grounds today include a ornamental lake, a walled garden, two entrance lodges, three cottages, a former racing yard, and productive farmland. Brief history The mansion was started by Benjamin Wyatt and completed by Philip Wyatt for Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, a famous coal magnate and founder of Seaham Harbour. The Marquess spent ¬£130,000 () to build and furnish the House. In 1841, just as the mansion was being completed, a fire broke out and gutted the house; it was later restored and remodelled by Ignatius Bonomi. There had been a house on the site since the Middle Ages, and the 3rd Marquess incorporated parts of an earlier 18th century building into his house. In the 19th century, George Vane-Tempest, who became Earl Vane in 1854 and the 5th Marquess of Londonderry in 1872, owned vast estates: in Ireland and in England and Wales; he also sat in the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for 26 years. Upon the death of the 5th Marquess in 1884 his eldest son, Charles, became the 6th Marquess; it was the 6th Marquess's wife, Lady Londonderry, who was the model for the famous Lady Roehampton in Vita Sackville-West's The Edwardians. The estate remained in the Londonderry family until 1987, though it was let as a training school for teachers from 1945 until 1960, during which time it lost most of its original contents through sales and breakages. The estate was sold in 1987 to Sir John Hall, along with . Hall spent ¬£4,000,000 to restore the house, hiring Rupert Lord to oversee the restoration; he later moved his company headquarters, as well as his home, into the mansion. The estate, comprising the house and of parkland, was listed for sale in July 2002 for ¬£8,000,000. It is now a four-star hotel owned by the Hall family continuing to occupy a small portion of land. Royal visits King King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) (as Prince and Princess of Wales before 1901) were frequent visitors to Wynyard. As King, Edward presided over a meeting of the Privy Council there in 1903 ‚Äî the first time the Council had met in a house belonging to a subject since 1625.Sir Almeric Fitzroy, Memoirs (London and New York, 1925), vol. I, p. 161. King George V also visited as Prince of Wales, including in November 1902. Developments at Wynyard There are three areas of housing development - approximately 800 properties in all - within the former Wynyard Estate: Wynyard Village, Wynyard Woods and Wynyard Park. Wynyard Estate's residents include Duncan Bannatyne, and many famous footballers including Andrew Davies, Nick Loughran, Malcolm Christie and Steve Baker. Former residents include Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer. Wynyard Estate has some of the most expensive houses in the North East, as well as the most expensive road in Teesside. Wynyard Park is home to several gated communities, the main one being the Manorside development, a collection of 27 self built executive homes. There is a golf club on Wellington Drive. Land north of the A689 has been acquired by Chris Musgrave, a Hartlepool businessman. For a time Wynyard Park was used on a commercial basis by Samsung. Plans to build an eco- friendly housing and parkland have been approved by the local council. They include 2000 houses, a 3-star hotel, and a 5-star business hotel.

polymerase. It is classified as a purine nucleoside triphosphate, with its chemical structure consisting of a deoxyribose sugar molecule bound to an adenine and to three phosphate groups. It differs from the energy-transferring molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a single hydroxyl group (the -OH group on the 2' carbon of the pentose sugar is replaced by -H in dATP), resulting in a deoxyribose instead of a ribose. Two phosphate groups can be hydrolyzed to yield deoxyadenosine monophosphate, which can then be used to synthesize DNA. Findings have also suggested that dATP can act as an energy-transferring molecule to maintain cell viability.  Synthesis   Enzymatic synthesis of deoxyadenosine triphosphate  Deoxyadenosine triphosphate is able to be enzymatically synthesized with DNA as the starting material using deoxyribonuclease (DNase), nuclease P1, adenylate kinase, and pyruvate kinase. The synthesis starts with the heat denaturation of DNA followed by treatment with DNase I to produce oligomers. Next, the solution is treated with nuclease P1 to form deoxynucleoside monophosphates. Using a mixture of adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, the deoxyadenosine monophosphate was selectively converted to dATP. After purification, a purity of 90%-95% can be achieved using this method of synthesis with a 40% overall yield.  Health effects   In immunocompromised individuals  High levels of dATP in the body can be toxic and result in impaired immune function, since dATP acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor for the DNA synthesis enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) tend to have elevated intracellular dATP concentrations because adenosine deaminase normally curbs adenosine levels by converting it into inosine. Deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase is known to cause immunodeficiency in individuals. Research has found that dATP may be a potential toxic metabolite in adenosine deaminase deficiency. Patients in the study who were immunodeficient and adenosine deaminase deficient were found to have over 50 times the levels of dATP in their erythrocytes compared to non- immunodeficient, adenosine deaminase deficient patients. This is abnormal and provides evidence that increased erythrocyte dATP levels are the toxic metabolites responsible for immune system deficiency in individuals with adenosine deaminase deficiency. Infusion of normal, non-enzyme deficient erythrocytes resulted in the loss of dATP in the erythrocytes of these individuals. Cells lacking the ability to transport or phosphorylate dATP have been shown to exhibit increased resistance to the toxic effects of excessive dATP, suggesting that the toxicity of dATP is dependent on the ability to intracellularly phosphorylate dATP. As such, some treatments for ADA focus on reducing dATP phosphorylation by the targeted inhibition of the responsible deoxynucleoside kinases, such as adenosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase. Deoxycytidine administered intravenously has also been used as an ADA treatment, although a clinical study found that deoxycytidine had only limited clinical effects on the T-cell immunity of ADA patients without discounting that some patients may respond more significantly to deoxycytidine therapy. In cardiac muscle In cardiac myosin, dATP has been shown to be a viable alternative to ATP as an energy substrate for facilitating cross-bridge formation. In an experiment involving canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), increasing cardiac dATP was found to be a potentially effective treatment for DCM.

A professional from 2000 until 2012, Ray competed for the UFC, King of the Cage, the Toronto Dragons of the IFL, and was featured on The Ultimate Fighter 4. Background Born and raised in Chicago, Ray began training in martial arts from a young age. Mixed martial arts Early career Ray made his professional debut in 2000, competing primarily at Welterweight, he amassed a record of 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 before appearing for the UFC. Ultimate Fighting Championship Ray made his UFC debut at UFC 51 on February 5, 2005 against Canadian David Loiseau. He was defeated via TKO due to a doctor stoppage in the first round. After picking up a win in the regional circuit, Ray returned to the promotion at UFC Ultimate Fight Night, facing Mike Swick. He was defeated via TKO from a combination of punches just 22 seconds into the fight. After going 4‚Äì1 in the regional circuit, Ray tried out for The Ultimate Fighter 4 and made it through to the final cast. The Ultimate Fighter In his quarterfinal matchup against Edwin Dewees, the two fought to a draw after two rounds, which called for a third round. As a cut had opened on Dewees face during the second round and the doctors let the fight continue. Ray lost the third round to a 10-9 decision by the judges. The bout was later called perhaps the bloodiest in Ultimate Fighter history. At The Ultimate Fighter: The Comeback Finale, Ray faced Charles McCarthy. Ray was defeated near the end of the first round with an armbar submission. International Fight League After being released from the UFC, Ray signed with the IFL, competing for the Toronto Dragons. Ray made his promotional debut at IFL: Connecticut on April 13, 2007. He won via first-round TKO. Ray next faced Brazilian Delson Heleno at IFL: Las Vegas on June 16, 2007.

Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to sabotage, terrorism, and contamination. Critical infrastructures naturally utilize information technology as this capability has become more and more available. As a result, they have become highly interconnected, and interdependent. Intrusions and disruptions in one infrastructure might provoke unexpected failures in others, which makes handing interdependencies a key concern. There are several examples where an incident at one critical infrastructure site affects others. For example, in 2003, the Northeastern American areas experienced a power outage that appears to have originated in the Midwest, and possibly from a tree branch.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/blohm_r/NYTimes130504.htm/&date;=2009-10-25+13:43:27 In 2013, damage caused by a sniper attack at an electrical substation in California threatened power distribution throughout Silicon Valley. Potential causes of infrastructure failure Critical infrastructure is vital for essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage will have serious impact on the economy as well as providing essential services to the communities it serves. There are a number of reasons why infrastructure needs to be heavily secured and protected. * Terrorism - person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted. * Theft ‚Äì person of groups breaking into critical infrastructure sites like electrical substations or telecommunication towers to steal materials or equipment (e.g. metal theft) * Sabotage - person or groups such as ex-employee, political groups against governments, environmental groups in defense of environment. Refer to Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors. * Information warfare - private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and also damage a country's infrastructure. For example, in cyberattacks on Estonia and cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war. * Natural disaster - hurricane or natural events which damage critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines, water and power grids. See Hurricane Ike and Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina. Security challenges for the electricity infrastructure One of the fundamental foundations of modern society is the electrical power systems. An intentional disruption of electricity supplies would affect national security, the economy, and every person's life. Because power grids and their sources are widely dispersed, this is a challenge for the effectiveness of defensive organizations and structures. Sabotage can damage electrical sources for the power grid, including civilian nuclear power stations. Sabotage in the form of cyberattacks can create havoc with computer, communication, and information systems, which could severely interrupt the electrical supply. This in turn can cause major disruptions to other infrastructure components of society. Comprehensive defense plans are proposed. One method is to isolate load systems. Sophisticated defense systems should be wide-area, real-time protection, with control systems that are alerted and guided by sensing technologies. Communication and information must be capably routed. Remedies Many countries have initiated government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure usually through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States Federal Protective Service and also creation of dedicated transport police such as the British Transport Police. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the Amtrak Police in the United States. A number of government organizations focus on infrastructure security and protection. In the USA, the Technical Support Working Group has the Infrastructure Protection Subgroup. The UK has the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre. Critical infrastructure sites may deploy perimeter intrusion detection systems, video surveillance, access control and other security systems to detect and respond intruders and other security events.

It is one among over 60 International Max Planck Research Schools in Germany. It is located in Munich and was established in 2005. The Ph.D. program is organised by three of the Max Planck Institutes and two universities in Munich. International Max Planck Research Schools To date more than 60 International Max Planck Research Schools (short: IMPRS) have been established in Germany, each representing a joint cooperative of Max Planck Institutes and one or several German universities. The concept for the International Max Planck Research Schools was jointly developed in 1999 by the Max Planck Society and the so-called Hochschul Rektoren Konferenz (HRK), a body representing all German universities. The aim of these PhD programs is to offer German and international doctoral students a first class education in innovative and interdisciplinary research environments with facilities and research projects. Each International Max Planck Research School covers a specific topic in one of the following areas: chemistry, physics & technology, biology & medicine or human sciences. In contrast to traditional doctoral education in Germany where a doctoral student is trained and supervised individually by a professor or group leader, Max Planck Research Schools offer structured programs with a defined curriculum and a supervision by a committee of normally 3 or more expert scientists. Language of instruction is English. German language courses are provided to interested international students. In order to maintain highest educational standards, all IMPRS programs are evaluated on a regular basis by an international and independent scientific commission.  International Max Planck Research School for Molecular Life Sciences (IMPRS-LS) The International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences (short: IMPRS-LS) was established in 2005. The research oriented PhD program is jointly organized by the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology and the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in cooperation with two of Germany's leading universities, the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen and the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. Over 60 research groups from the Munich area participate in the program, covering many aspects of life sciences including biochemistry, cell biology, molecular medicine, neurobiology and structural biology. IMPRS-LS is 100% committed to basic research and aims to address fundamental questions in the following research areas: * Biochemistry * Biophysics * Bio-imaging * Computational Biology * Gene Regulation * Immunology * Neurobiology * Neurodegeneration * Protein Structure * Signaling * Systems Biology Although students specialize in a particular research topic, the interdisciplinary context of the program facilitates interactions with other research groups and fosters the ability of cross-frontier thinking. Laboratory work is supplemented by seminars, summer schools, elective courses, training in soft skills and participation in national or international conferences. Currently, some 140 doctoral students are enrolled in IMPRS-LS and approximately 50% of those come from abroad (Germany: 50%, Europe: 30%, Overseas: 20%) Annually, 30 to 40 doctoral students from all over the world are accepted to the program. Deadline for application is January 6, each year. All doctoral students receive a fellowship covering living expenses and tuition. Entry requirement is a MSc degree (or equivalent) in the fields of biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, biophysics, biotechnology, medicine or in a related discipline. The doctoral degree is usually awarded by one of the two participating Munich universities. International doctoral students may also obtain their doctoral degree from a university residing in their home country. Currently, more than 250 doctoral students from all over the world are working at the Max Planck Institutes of Biochemistry and Neurobiology, together with numerous doctoral students from close by university laboratories. Amongst other activities, graduate students organize a regular social get together, a seminar series, and , an annual student symposium.

She first appeared on 7 December 2006, during episodes set in Dorset. This is Henry's second role in EastEnders, as she previously played prostitute Lorraine Salter (1991‚Äì1992). Henry took a break from the show in September 2012, departing alongside on-screen daughter, Carly.Shirley issues a warning as she leaves Walford ‚Äì EastEnders Spoiler ‚Äì Soaps ‚Äì Digital Spy She returned on 3 December 2012.Soapland's joiners, movers and leavers ‚Äì Soaps Site News / Contact Us ‚Äì Digital Spy Shirley is one of several EastEnders characters to appear in the internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. Some of her storylines have included trying and failing to rebuild relationships with her children Carly (Kellie Shirley) and Deano (Matt Di Angelo), a friendship with Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), a volatile relationship with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), the introduction of her son Mick (Danny Dyer), who at first was believed to be her brother, and his family, an affair with Phil, despite him being in a relationship with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and accidentally shooting Phil. Former EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has described her as a \\"new icon\\" of the show. Storylines Shirley first appears, when, against her former husband Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels) wishes, she introduces herself to her adult children, Carly (Kellie Shirley) and Dean (Matt Di Angelo). Carly is hostile but Dean is amenable, so Shirley moves to Walford to be near them. Kevin and Shirley maintain an antagonistic relationship. Shirley attempts to sabotage his relationship with Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and threatens to tell her children about their true paternity, which she eventually does: she tells Carly her father is a man named Daniel and Dean that she does not know who his father is. Kevin had brought up Carly and Dean as his own, as well as his natural child with Shirley, Jimbo (Lloyd Richards), who had cystic fibrosis, which Shirley struggled with and ended up walking out on the family, not attending Jimbo's funeral when he died aged 21. The revelation only drives Carly and Dean further away. When she learns that Kevin has been selling cut- and-shut cars, she confronts him. They try to dispose of a stolen car together but are involved in a crash, which kills Kevin. In the aftermath, Carly rejects her mother and leaves Walford. Dean, who gets in trouble with the police, is imprisoned and when released he blames Shirley for all his problems and also moves away. Shirley begins a relationship with Vinnie Monks (Bobby Davro), at the urging of her best friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), but the romance eventually ends when Vinnie learns Shirley is harbouring feelings for Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Phil, an alcoholic, gets drunk with Shirley, uses her for sex and as a surrogate mother for his son, Ben (Joshua Pascoe). Shirley falls in love with Phil. She gives him an alibi when he is suspected of murder and helps him get custody of his daughter, Louise (Brittany Papple), leading to them beginning a legitimate relationship. Shirley is so in love with Phil that she is willing to overlook his misdemeanours. She stands by him when Louise returns to her mother and Phil develops an addiction to crack cocaine. She even forgives him for several affairs, firstly with fellow addict, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and secondly with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber). In remorse for his wrongdoings, Phil tries to convince Shirley to marry him and she almost does but decides that marriage is unnecessary. She remains with Phil under the proviso that he never cheats on her again. Shirley's life is thrown into turmoil when her best friend, Heather, is found dead at her flat. Unknown to Shirley, the murderer is Phil's son Ben. Phil tries to cover up Ben's involvement but Shirley grows obsessed with tracing the killer. She finds the murder weapon, a metal photo frame, in a neighbour's house and traces it to a charity shop where it was donated by Phil. She realises that Phil was involved in Heather's death and discusses her suspicions with Ben, who buckles under pressure and reveals information about Heather's death that only the murderer could know. Shirley realises that Ben killed Heather and tries to drown him in the bath, but Phil stops her. Phil convinces her not to call the police but Ben goes to the police and confesses. Unable to cope with Phil's betrayal, Shirley ends the relationship and starts drinking heavily. Phil sees that she needs help and calls Carly, who takes Shirley to stay with her and her son Jimmy. When Shirley returns, she remains hostile to Phil and takes his hush money, despite still having feelings for him. Shirley and her sister, Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), move into The Queen Victoria public house, when their supposed brother, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), buys it and moves his family to Walford. After 25 years of animosity, Shirley is reunited with her father, Stan Carter (Timothy West). Despite their mutual hostility, Stan gives Shirley ¬£10,000 which she invests in the pub for a 20% share. It transpires that Stan is in contact with Dean. Stan encourages a reunion with mother and son, but Dean remains hostile to Shirley. Eventually, Shirley manages to build bridges with her father and Dean. Shirley grows jealous of Phil's relationship with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean). Sharon agrees to marry Phil but discovers that Phil was responsible for a break-in at her bar. Furious, Sharon decides to fleece Phil for his money in revenge. Phil discovers this, confides in Shirley and starts an affair with her, planning to jilt Sharon at the altar and resume a relationship with Shirley. However, Sharon and Phil discover their respective deceptions and ultimately decide to marry. Dejected, Shirley admits her affair with Phil after the wedding and when Phil rejects her, she shoots him. Fearing Shirley's incarceration, Shirley's aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) organises her escape. Dean is distraught and when Mick's partner, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), comforts him, and he rapes her. Mick and Dean eventually bring Shirley back to Walford when Stan admits he has terminal prostate cancer. They meet Shirley's childhood sweetheart, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), and Dean realises that he is Buster's son. They plan to run away together but Mick has Buster arrested for breaking his bail conditions as he is on day release. It is later revealed that Buster is also Mick's father and Shirley is actually Mick's mother, not his sister. Shirley and Mick find Shirley's mother, Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), hiding at Babe's house. Sylvie has Alzheimer's disease and tells Mick she is not his mother but he dismisses this as her being confused. Shirley tries to stop Mick interacting with Sylvie, fearing her secret will be revealed. However, Sylvie is invited to Christmas dinner. Secrets are divulged at the dinner: Linda reveals Dean raped her so Mick tells Shirley before attacking Dean and is only stopped by Shirley confessing that she is his mother, not sister, and that Dean is his brother. The family is split following this revelation as Shirley sides with Dean, believing his version of events. Shirley reveals the reason why she kept her identity as Mick's mother a secret: her pregnancy with Mick was scorned by Sylvie, who attempted to force a miscarriage by pushing her down a flight of stairs. Shirley was forced to raise Mick as her brother and Stan's son, out of fear she would never see him again. Hostilities continue and Shirley struggles to bond with Mick, due to her and Buster's continued alliance to Dean. This results in Shirley being banished from Stan's funeral, despite Shirley having nursed her father through his dying moments. Shirley learns from Dean he has a seven-year-old daughter and confronts the child's mother, Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), who continues to lie. Shirley is upset when Linda forbids her from seeing Ollie. Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) gives Shirley the address of Dean's daughter, verifying the child, Jade Green (Amaya Edward), previously Roya, is alive. Shirley finds Jade but discovers she has cystic fibrosis. After Dean decides that Jade is better off without him and Shirley warns that she will fight for custody, eventually gaining Shabnam and Dean's support. When Shirley finds a bra behind her settee, she assumes Buster had sex with Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), which Carol does not deny. Shirley nearly throws Buster out and starts considering adopting Jade alone but Carol admits that nothing happened and Shirley helps her come to terms with her mastectomy. Shirley and Buster are awarded custody of Jade after a grieving Shabnam does not contest it. Shirley prevents Dean from raping Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and, finally believing that he is a rapist, tries to drown him in the bath but he recovers and strikes her as Linda enters. Dean then admits that he raped Linda and goes into hiding. Dean confronts Shirley at Mick and Linda's wedding and attempts to drown her. Mick saves her and Dean, who is then arrested over Roxy. Shirley then encourages Mick and Linda to get married and helps Nancy and Lee run the pub while Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon and has Jade help out to give her some work experience. She is furious when Shabnam turns up overprotective of Jade outside of her visiting hours, but after Masood tells her that Shabnam is unlikely to have any more children, she grows sympathetic and allows Jade to spend more time with Shabnam. She finds Phil binge drinking, where he admits that he drunk-drove and crashed a car with him, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Sharon's son Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau), and Ian took the blame for driving. Shirley encourages Phil to tell Sharon what really happened, and when he eventually does later that night, Sharon ends their marriage. The following day, Shirley learns from Louise (now played by Tilly Keeper) that Phil has been rushed to hospital and his liver is damaged. Shirley, Sharon and Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth) go to the hospital only to find that Phil has discharged himself. They find Phil drunk at the pub, where he insults his family and hits Kathy. Shirley throws Phil out and admits to Buster that she still has feelings for Phil and is upset as he is risking his health. Buster comforts her and tells her she should move on from Phil because he only cares about himself. A month later, Shirley receives another visiting order from Dean, and eventually decides to visit Dean in prison, to encourage him to plead guilty for trying to rape Roxy. Dean, however, is in denial so Shirley threatens to disown him permanently if he pleads not guilty. The next day, Shabnam tells Shirley, Buster and Jade that she is moving to Ealing so Jade can visit her anytime. In court, Shirley watches as Dean pleads not guilty, much to her disgust. However, due to his failure to surrender to custody on numerous previous occasions, Dean is remanded in custody and a trial in June. Realising that Jade needs protecting from Dean and should be with her mother, Shirley and Buster tell Shabnam that they would like Jade to live with her full-time, giving her full custody, which she accepts. Shirley, unaware that Buster is having an affair with Kathy, is furious when he pays off their acquitted son, Dean, with all their savings, but is later devastated when Buster leaves Walford without saying goodbye to her, whilst she is in the midst of helping Phil end his alcoholism. Mick suggests to Shirley that Buster had an affair with Denise, who is now heavily pregnant. However, when Shirley confronts Denise, Denise confesses she is expecting Phil's son, which is overheard by Sharon. Babe breaches the pub licence when she inadvertently sells alcohol to an undercover police officer, and the police arrive and arrest Mick, Babe and Shirley. They are formally charged with breaching their pub licence, remaining in custody until their appearance in court the following morning. Shirley later catches Babe stealing money from the safe, and discover that she stolen the entire money that her father left her, Mick and Tina in his will causing Mick to evict her. Shirley and Mick then disgusted to learn that Mick and Linda's son, Lee Carter (Danny- Boy Hatchard), has hit his wife, Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty), during a heated argument. Mick confides in Shirley; she strongly advises Mick to tell Lee that he must leave Whitney, which he does so. Shirley and Tina later have arguments as to whether they should put Sylvie in a home as Shirley does not want to look after her as she can see the trouble Mick is in. Realising Mick will never be able to pay the ¬£20,000 fine ordered by the court, Shirley decides to put the blame on herself and she tells the police she knew Babe was breaching their licence but did nothing about it. She is subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice. Although the Carters initially think that Shirley will only be in prison for six weeks, they are heartbroken to learn that her sentence has been doubled, meaning that she will stay in prison for three months. Tina visits Shirley in prison to inform her of Sylvie's death which does not seem to upset Shirley but later when her cellmate Debbie Morton (Beth Cordingly) teases Shirley about her feelings, Shirley beats her up in their cell. Shirley is tricked into selling the freehold of The Queen Vic by Max Branning (Jake Wood) and she forges Mick's signature. Mick is angry when he finds out and The Queen Vic is being controlled by Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner). The Carters are unaware that it is part of a plan by a company, Weyland & Co, to demolish The Queen Vic and redevelop the whole area. The Carters are tricked into debt and are served with an eviction notice, however, they are able to save The Queen Vic when Mick gets involved in a heist and Lee's friend, Callum \\"Halfway\\" Highway (Tony Clay) donates an expensive ring that he stole from the heist. Development Shirley's creation was announced in September 2006, at which time she was described as being \\"brassy, rough, tarty and tough-as-old-boots\\" by media entertainment website Digital Spy. Henry, who had appeared in the serial during the early 1990s as prostitute Lorraine Salter, said: \\"I'm thrilled to be joining EastEnders. I'm both nervous and excited as I've watched it for many years\\". Created as an extension of the established Wicks family, Shirley's arrival was welcomed by her son, Deano. Di Angelo deemed his character \\"very fond\\" of his mother, keen to forge a relationship with her, and attributed Deano's childish characterisation to her absence during his formative years. Other relatives were less enthused by her arrival: Shirley developed a rivalry with Wicks matriarch Pat (Pam St. Clement), which culminated in a physical fight and their arrest in April 2007. Digital Spy Dek Hogan highlighted a similarity between the two, and commented prior to their fight that Shirley was \\"so like Pat was when she first arrived it's frightening.\\" A friendship developed between Shirley and local businessman Phil Mitchell in 2008, as she underwent a breast-cancer scare. Reluctant to seek medical help, Shirley admitted to Phil that she was afraid, and he responded with \\"genuine kindness\\". Their friendship developed into romance, and Shirley was later able to save him from an addiction to crack cocaine, which Henry felt reflected the strength of their relationship. Although Shirley was wounded to discover he had been unfaithful to her, Henry explained that, regardless of the tough fa√ßade her character projected, she still loved him. She characterised Shirley as \\"a strong, proud woman [who] wouldn't stay with someone for [the wrong] reasons\\", and suggested they could survive the affair: \\"It will need effort to make it work and they'll never have the perfect relationship, but neither Phil nor Shirley would want a completely quiet life.\\" Reception Accolades Henry has been nominated for several television awards for her portrayal of Shirley. She and Fergison were nominated in the Best On-Screen Partnership category at the 2008 British Soap Awards, and Digital Spy Soap Awards, and for Best Double Act at the 2009 TV Times Awards. Henry was shortlisted in the Best Soap Actress category at the 2009 TV Quick and TV Choice awards. At the 2009 Inside Soap Awards, Shirley was nominated in the Best Bitch category. Henry was also shortlisted in the 'Best Actress' category at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards.BBC ‚Äì EastEnders: Inside Soap Awards Final Nominations Revealed Critical response Early in Shirley's tenure, Hogan advised viewers to \\"rejoice in [her] wonderful nastiness\\". He found her an \\"unpleasant\\" addition to the series, and though he commended Henry's portrayal, he hoped to see more possibility of redemption for Shirley, as \\"It's difficult to buy into a character that comes across as unremittingly unpleasant.\\" Hogan called her \\"the most convincing drunk\\" in the programme for twenty years, but noted, \\"that really doesn't make her any less annoying and her scenes are a pain in the neck to sit through.\\" Tess Lamacraft from The Sun Buzz magazine questioned Shirley's motivations in accepting Phil's infidelities. She could not decide whether Shirley was \\"stupid, desperate or just madly in love\\" with him. Kate White of Inside Soap praised the friendship between Shirley and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), \\"We love, love, love the genius pairing of Jean and Shirley. With Heather [Trott, played by Cheryl Fergison] having been brown bread [dead] for over a year, it's time Shirley got a new BFF ‚Äì and we reckon zany Jean is perfect.\\" In the British media she has been referred to as \\"Shirley Terrahawk\\" due to her resemblance to a character from the Terrahawks. Jim Shelly once branded her the \\"human Terrahawk\\" in the Daily Mirror and \\"an alcoholic Terrahawk\\" in The Guardian. John McKie from the Daily Record said that Phil getting together with \\"Shirley the Terrahawk\\" was grotesque. Kevin O'Sullivan from the Sunday Mirror said that \\"Shirley Terrahawk went into theatrical meltdown\\" after Heather died; adding that it was \\"hilarious overacting\\" on Henry's part.

The market offered hundreds of different products ranging from fresh produce, accessories, huge computer and IT section, household products, men's, women's and kids clothing and shoes, tools and toys. Rides and entertainment also operated in the Gardens during market hours, including: * 9-Hole Mini Golf in Japanese Gardens * 5 km Train around the perimeter of Caribbean Gardens * Jungle Cruise boat ride around Lake Caribbean * Chair Lift Caribbean Gardens and Market was situated at the foothills of the Dandenong's in Scoresby, just 25 km from Melbourne.

Spooner acquired of land in Scoresby which he named \\"Dalmore Park\\". On this land he built a French Provincial mansion. In 1958, whilst overseas, he found the material known as fibreglass and realised its potential in the boat-building industry. Soon after, he established the Caribbean Boat Factory. It soon became necessary to have a lake for the testing of the boats and in the early 1960s, Lake Caribbean was built. It was subsequently opened to the public and developed by one of his sons, Rod Spooner, as Caribbean Gardens.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-02/pirates- of-the-caribbean-gardens-gone-as-markets-venue-turns-50/7130478 The site is significant being Victoria's \\"first local example\\" of a theme park, with many original features (Japanese gardens, railway, chairlift, jungle cruise & picnic areas) still intact today. It was noted in the Woman's Weekly, 1966 that the Spooner family 'aims to turn the area into a kind of local Disneyland, and already the shores many islets at one end of the lake are dotted with fl fibreglass crocodiles, elephants, hippopotamuses'. The park also included 'ski kite-riding from the Cypress Gardens' in the US.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/46075367?searchTerm=Caribbean%20Gardens The chairlift ride was built by Jack Griffiths and chairlift manufacturer Ron McCallum,https://www.australianmountains.com/australianskilifts#17 originally from Whistlestop Amusement Parkhttps://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/whistle-st-o- p-amusement-park in Skye Road, Frankston which closed in 1974.

It is Located in the B. B. D. Bagh area of Kolkata (Calcutta)-the Capital of the state. Members of the Legislative assembly are directly elected by the people. The legislative assembly comprises 294 Members of Legislative Assembly, which include 294 members directly elected from single-seat constituencies. Its term is five years, unless sooner dissolved. History West Bengal Legislative Assembly The history of the West Bengal Legislature can be traced back to 18 January 1862 when under the Indian Councils Act of 1861, a 12 Member Legislative Council for Bengal Presidency was established by the Governor-General of British India with the Lt. Governor of Bengal and some nominated members. The strength of the Council was gradually enlarged by subsequent acts. Under the Indian Councils Act of 1892, the maximum strength of the Council was raised to 20 out of which seven were to be elected. The Indian Councils Act of 1909 further raised the number of members of the Council to 50. Under the Government of India Act 1919, the number of members of the Legislative Council was once again raised to 125. The Bengal Legislative Council constituted under the Act of 1919 was formally inaugurated on 1 February 1921 by the Duke of Connaught. Entrance of West Bengal Legislative Assembly A few years later, under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1935, two chambers of the Bengal Provincial Legislature: the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, were created. The life of the Assembly, consisting of 250 members, was to be five years unless dissolved sooner; while the Council, with a membership of not less than 63 and not more than 65, was made a permanent body and not subject to dissolution with the provision that one-third of the members should retire every three years. On the eve of Independence in 1947, Bengal Province was partitioned into West Bengal and East Bengal (East Pakistan). The West Bengal Legislative Assembly was constituted with 90 members representing the constituencies that fell within the area of West Bengal and two nominated members from Anglo-Indian community. The Bengal Legislative Council stood abolished. The Legislative Assembly met for the first time after Independence on 21 November 1947. The Constitution of India again provided for a bicameral Legislature for West Bengal. Accordingly, the West Bengal Legislative Council consisting of 51 members was constituted on 5 June 1952. The number of members in the Legislative Assembly was 240 including two nominated members from the Anglo-Indian Community. After the first General Elections, the new Assembly met for the first time on 18 June 1952. On 21 March 1969, a resolution was passed by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly for the abolition of the Legislative Council.

The school is named after William Tyndale, a 16th-century religious reformer and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English and was tried for heresy and treason and then strangled and burnt at the stake. The school has students from 38 different ethnic backgrounds covering 58 different language groups. The school is situated on in the south-west corner of Blacktown and is accessible by public bus routes and buses that Tyndale operates around the surrounding areas. , the School had approximately 900 students from early learning, through Year K to Year 12.  History  Tyndale's story began in 1957 when the Blacktown Reformed Church looked into the feasibility of starting a Parent Controlled Christian School in Blacktown. In February 1966 the Kildare Rd site was officially opened with 3 classrooms, 2 teachers and 32 students. At the time this site was educating students from Kindergarten to Year 6. In 1976 this was expanded to include high school and as the existing site was full, the school developed and then moved to the Douglas Road site in 1979. In 1981, technics, music and economics rooms are added and the first cohort of Year 12 students complete the NSW Higher School Certificate (HSC). The first library building was completed in 1983 and new primary classrooms were finished in 1988 to allow double stream classes. In 1995, the multi- purpose school hall was completed which included new classrooms, a support room and extended staff facilities. In 1998, a new Kindergarten classroom building was installed to allow triple streaming of classes. In 2004, a new computer and Design & Technology block was built and opened on 24 August 2005. In 2010, thanks to the Building the Education Revolution from the Australian Government, building commenced on a new library and multi-purpose centre. That year also commenced building on a new restaurant-quality Hospitality centre. Both buildings were opened on 29 April 2011. In 2015, a new Administration building was completed which in turn provided much needed space (the old admin building) to the growing middle and senior school staff. In 2016, the Prep playground area was refurbished and plans for the new senior school building (due to commence construction in 2017) were drawn up.  School vision  The vision of the school is \\"To see parents and children experience Bible-based, Christ-centred parent-controlled education, in order that they may be prepared and equipped for a life of service as disciples of Jesus Christ.\\"  School structure  The school is split into four areas: prep, junior, middle and senior school.  Prep  Prep school began in Term 2, 2008. In 2016 there are 3 classes with room for 70 students operating 5 days per week.  Junior school  Junior school consists of Kindergarten to Year 5, which is then split into 2 areas: Infants (Kindergarten to Year 2) and Primary (Year 3 to Year 5). Each class has children of similar age with the one class teacher. Sports, excursions, cultural or interest events, camps, concerts and other community celebrations are important and exciting aspects of the K-5 program. Tyndale's K-5 Section offers a Christ-centred education and develops a firm basis upon which Middle and senior school education can be built.  Middle school  Middle school consists of Year 6 to Year 8. Core units are integral to the work that students are doing in middle school. These integrated Core units focus on skill and knowledge development in English, Human Society and its Environment (History, Geography and Civics), Biblical Studies, Personal Development and Health. Core units help students to make the links between subjects which in the past have been taught as separate areas of study. In the middle school, each class has a core teacher who will have the daily academic and pastoral responsibility for that particular class. Core teachers teach the core subject of English. Typically a range of sports will be available for middle school students. Sport for middle school is set for each grade individually. Cricket, Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Slider hockey, Volleyball, Handball, Touch football, Softball, Rock climbing, Dance, table tennis, and Athletics. Note that not all sports will be available each term.  Senior school  Senior school consists of Year 9 to Year 12, which is then split into 2 areas: High (Year 9 and 10) and Senior (Year 11 and 12). Students in Years 11 and 12 are not expected to participate in compulsory Sport, although Year 11 students are able to play inter-school Sport activities.

In 2014 it had around 17,000 paying subscribers.A Companion to the Australian Media, Australian Scholarly Publishing, North Melbourne, 2014, p 124. History Stephen Mayne Crikey was founded by activist shareholder Stephen Mayne, a journalist and former staffer of then Liberal Victorian premier Jeff Kennett. It developed out of Mayne's \\"jeffed.com\\" website, which in turn developed out of his aborted independent candidate campaign for Kennett's seat of Burwood. Longstanding Crikey political commentators/reporters have included former Liberal insider Christian Kerr (who originally wrote under the pseudonym \\"Hillary Bray\\"), Guy Rundle, Charles Richardson, Bernard Keane, Mungo MacCallum and Hugo Kelly. In 2003 Stephen Mayne, the then proprietor, was forced to sell his house in order to settle defamation cases brought by radio presenter Steve Price and former ALP senator Nick Bolkus over false statements published about them by Crikey. Staff of then treasurer Peter Costello banned Crikey from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 budget 'lock ups', in which financial journalists are shown the federal budget papers some hours in advance so that their publications can report the budget in depth as soon as it is released, on the grounds that Crikey is not considered to be part of the \\"mainstream media\\". Private Media Partners On 1 February 2005, it was announced that Stephen Mayne had sold Crikey to Private Media Partners, a company, owned by former Editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald, Eric Beecher, for A$1 million. Under the agreement, Mayne has occasionally written for the email newsletter. Under PMP's stewardship the publication aimed for \\"professional\\" style, avoiding the use of in-house nicknames and other idiosyncrasies of the original Crikey. In February 2006, The Age reported that a co-founder and writer, Hugo Kelly, had been sacked for reasons the company claimed were on the grounds of professional misconduct but which Kelly maintained because they had \\"no guts\\".

The Bachelor of Sacred Theology is offered by a number of pontifical universities. It is sometimes offered as a graduate degree, for students who have already completed a Bachelor of Arts or other first degree. It can also be offered as an \\"ecclesiastical degree\\", granted directly by church hierarchy after one has completed requirements in addition to those necessary for a civil degree, but which are required for ordination. Within the Catholic Church, the STB is the first of three ecclesiastical degrees in theology (the second and third are the Licentiate of Sacred Theology and Doctor of Sacred Theology respectively), and as such is granted by pontifical faculties under the authority of the Holy See. It is awarded upon successful completion of the first cycle, a three-year course of studies that aims for a comprehensive competence in theology. Despite its name, the STB is a graduate degree, at least in the United States. While acceptance to an STB programme always requires at least two prior years' undergraduate study of philosophy, as well as knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, in the United States a completed undergraduate degree is generally required for admission to an STB programme. Thus it is roughly equivalent academically to a Master of Divinity (although the STB has a more academic focus while the MDiv has a more pastoral focus), and the two are sometimes granted together. Faculties which offer the degree Bachelor of Sacred Theology include the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium), Regis College, University of Torontohttps://regiscollege.ca/ecclesiastical-degrees/#stb (Canada), Tilburg University (Netherlands), P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic Universityhttps://ppke.hu/en/about-the-university/faculties/faculty-of- theology (Hungary), Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomashttp://eccle.ust.edu.ph/st_pad_stb.htm (Philippines), Catholic University of America (United States), Saint John's Seminary, Boston (United States), and Kenrick-Glennon Seminaryhttps://kenrick.edu/about/stb/ (United States).

In the Ultimate Fighting Championships, Thomas is a UFC 41 Lightweight Tournament Semifinalist. He holds a Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Ricardo Liborio and currently runs two successful Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA academies in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Thomas holds notable victories of (UFC Lightweight Champion) Jens Pulver, (UFC Welterweight Champion) Matt Serra, and (Strikeforce Lightweight Champion) Clay Guida. Thomas has acted in local independent films, portraying The Fight Kid in Chris Fuller's Loren Cass and Reverend Pierce in Natalie, Queen of Scots.  Background  Thomas was born in Wilmington, Delaware, where he lived until he was 12 years old. When he was 12 Thomas moved to Port St. Lucie, Florida, and attended Port St. Lucie High School. Thomas flirted with baseball and football growing up, but ultimately did not have a serious interest in team sports because he did not like negatively affecting his teammates. A few weeks before his 18th birthday, Thomas' life changed drastically. He had recently broken up with his girlfriend, and in a fit of rage beat up her new boyfriend at her house. The young Thomas was charged with battery and had to spend his weekends in prison for the next year. Soon, he turned his attention to jiu-jitsu and began training in a small academy near his home.  Mixed martial arts career  Before entering the UFC, Thomas held a 12‚Äì1 MMA record including wins over future UFC lightweight champion Jens Pulver and Dokonjonosuke Mishima, with his only loss coming to future UFC lightweight title challenger Caol Uno. Thomas made his UFC debut at UFC 32, in a fight against future UFC Lightweight and Welterweight champion B.J. Penn, where he lost by TKO (strikes) in the first round. Thomas returned at UFC 33, defeating Fabiano Iha by unanimous decision. At UFC 39, Thomas faced Japanese superstar Caol Uno in a rematch. The fight was part of a tournament to determine the new UFC Lightweight Champion. After three rounds, Thomas lost by unanimous decision. His next fight was a split decision victory over future UFC welterweight champion Matt Serra at UFC 41. This fight would prove somewhat controversial, due to one of the judges mistakenly placing the score he assigned to Thomas in the column reserved for Serra. This caused Serra to be declared the winner by decision, but the mistake was discovered and Thomas and his team were notified of the change, giving Thomas the split decision victory. This would be Thomas' last UFC fight for 3 years. Thomas was a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter 4 where he defeated Mikey Burnett in the first round, before losing to training partner Chris Lytle by decision in the semi-finals. Thomas returned at the finale on November 11, 2006, to face Rich Clementi, winning via rear naked choke in the second round. Thomas was then defeated via submission (rear naked choke) by future UFC lightweight title challenger Kenny Florian after injuring his knee in a takedown attempt while headlining the main event at UFC Fight Night 11. Doctors said in his takedown attempt that Thomas tore his meniscus and stretched his PCL. His most recent UFC fight was a unanimous decision loss to Josh Neer at UFC Fight Night 13. He was released from his UFC contract after this fight. After his loss to Neer, Thomas decided to drop a weight class to featherweight (145 lbs). He debuted at featherweight against Dustin Pieken securing a triangle choke in the first round. He has followed that up with TKO wins over Gabe Lemley and Dustin Pague. Thomas had signed with Shine Fights and was expected to make his debut against Ricardo Mayorga on May 15 in Fayetteville, North Carolina but it was canceled after Don King was granted an injunction preventing Mayorga from fighting. Thomas was scheduled to return after a nearly two-year-long layoff Oct. 7, 2011, at Fight Time 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a promotion headed up by his American Top Team boxing trainer, Howard Davis Jr. But Thomas was in a car accident prior to the event and had to be hospitalized for his injuries. His fight against George Sheppard was scheduled to be the main event of Fight Time 7: The Return of Din Thomas. On January 2, 2014, Thomas announced his retirement from mixed martial arts. Coaching career Besides his own professional mixed martial artist career, Thomas has been coaching since the early days of MMA. He started coaching at Mike Metzger‚Äôs Internal Power Karate School in 1999. Thomas owned multiple MMA and jiu-jitsu schools until he was recruited to become one of the primary coaches at American Top Team in 2015. Before becoming a full-time coach at ATT, he had been partially affiliated with the team and its athletes since 2001. In March 2020, Thomas announced that he had departed from ATT in order to pursue his own MMA camp.  Personal life  Thomas is married and has a son named Ethon. He also appeared in the 2007 Gotham Award-nominated independent feature film Loren Cass which had its United States premiere at Dennis Hopper's CineVegas Film Festival and its international premiere in the prestigious Filmmakers of the Present competition at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland. The film was released in theaters and on DVD in 2009 by Kino International. Thomas was arrested on October 30, 2007, on a charge of \\"felony prohibited competitions\\" in Port St. Lucie, Florida at his training gym. As of November 30, 2007, the Assistant State Attorney's office decided not to file formal charges against Thomas and filed paperwork dismissing the charge on which he was arrested. The Assistant D.A. stated if the fighter or participants were students of Thomas' school, and the purpose of the school is to teach martial arts, then they meet the exception to the law.

Most of the essays are based on segments from the NPR radio program Fresh Air. Nunberg looks at modern culture through the lens of language, using his expertise as a linguist to highlight the subtle ways in which language influences society. The essays are organized by subject.  The Passing Scene  In this section Nunberg focuses on language as a sign of generational change. Beginning with a personal anecdote of his struggles with his wife to find an appropriate name for their new baby daughter, he goes on to discuss a variety of topics, such as the increasing influence of conversational tics like \\"you know,\\" the legacy of Yiddish words in American English, the question of personal favorite words, the effect that television shows have on the language, and the use of wordplay in country music.  Word Histories  Nunberg examines how the meaning of particular words has changed, indicating shifts in societal values. He talks about how slang comes from a different sector of society than it once did, how words with obscure origins mysteriously become obsolete, how the word suburb has signified different social conditions through the ages, how portmanteau words have been on the increase in modern times, and how sarcasm has gradually displaced irony.  Politics of the English Language  Nunberg discusses how people's choice of words reflects recent political history, examining the difference between force and violence, the use of -i as a suffix for Middle Eastern countries, the phrase political correctness, the Ebonics controversy, and the debate over the word \\"Jew.\\"  The Two R's  Nunberg examines the issue of traditional grammar vs. shifting usages, taking a relatively liberal perspective on English as an evolving tongue. He talks about the anachronistic nature of spelling bees; the problems in how parts of speech are traditionally taught; the curious survival of the split infinitive rule; the pros and cons of English speakers' tendency to turn nouns into verbs; and the ambiguous meaning of the word \\"literacy.\\"  Technical Terms  Nunberg examines the shifting language of technology, such as words like \\"virtual\\" and \\"hacker,\\" and he discusses other technology language issues such as computer grammar checkers and emoticons.  Business Talk  Nunberg discusses the language of the business world, including the synonyms for firing, brand names, and the use of the word \\"issue\\" as a euphemism for \\"problem.\\"  Valediction  The final section contains a whimsical poem reflecting on the issues discussed in the book.

In fact, he had taken the initiative to start the newspapers, with very limited resources, when just about everybody dismissed his efforts to start a private media house as a bad business move. However, Kantipur defied all naysayers and went on to write a history of its own ‚Äì perhaps the greatest success story for a corporate in Nepal, post-1990 after Mr Binod Raj Gyawali and Kailash Sirohiya took over equal partnership.Editorial: With Malice towards None and Charity towards All, Nation Weekly, April 19‚Äì25, 2004, p. 6 In fact, it was a phase when the print media in the private sector not only succeeded in acquiring credibility -a tag that until then was monopolized by the government owned Gorkhapatra and the Rising Nepal-but also promoted professionalism in journalism to a great extent attracting talents to join in. The massacre of the royal family in June 2001 prompted the first crisis between Kantipur Publications and the government. Two directors of Kantipur Mr Binod Raj Gyawali and Kailash Sirohiya were arrested and charged with \\"sedition\\" after publishing comments by a Maoist leader about the death of King Birendra. The proclamation of a state of emergency on November 26, 2001, by King Gyanendra under the direction of then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba suspended the press freedom guaranteed by the country's Constitution a decade earlier. Police began a wave of repression: more than fifty journalists were arrested, many publications were banned outright. Following a February 1, 2005 royal coup by King Gyanendra, Kantipur Publications operated under tighter restrictions. Journalists throughout Nepal were subject to imprisonment and beatings by the Royal Nepal Army. Nevertheless, Kantipur Publications continued to criticize the regime despite the royal proclamation and the ongoing civil war. In March 2005, Narayan Wagle, editor in chief of Kantipur, was held for questioning by police on suspicion of criticizing the king in print. During the 2006 uprising, Kantipur Publications continued operations despite increased crackdowns by the monarchy on private media. Press freedom has been restored since the restoration of democracy in Nepal in May 2006, allowing Kantipur Publications to operate without fear of reprisal by the state. Trouble with Maoists In 2007, Kantipur Publications faced pressure from Maoist-aligned organizations such as Young Communist LeagueNewspaper Closure: Maoist Madness, by Dinesh Wagle and the All Nepal Trade Union Federation.Free Press vs Maoists: Updates on Kantipur Struggle, by Dinesh Wagle However, an agreement was reached between Kantipur and the Federation.Kantipur and Maoist Agreement, by Dinesh Wagle This abruptly led the longest serving chairman Mr Hem Raj Gyawali to resign.

He is one of three pioneer hosts of Eat Bulaga!, which is the longest-running Philippine noontime variety show. He owns the film and TV production company M-Zet Productions. Sotto won four consecutive titles for Philippine Box Office King from 2004 to 2007 awarded by the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Awards, and received three nominations for Best Actor at the Metro Manila Film Festival. He has been accused of gang rape in the case of Pepsi Paloma, and was later reported to have lied about his actions and obstructed evidence to keep his job, even having the woman murdered to silence her. Biography Family background Sotto was born on April 28, 1954. He is the youngest son of Marcelino Antonio Ojeda Sotto Sr. and Dr. Herminia Castelo. He studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He is the brother of Valmar \\"Val\\" Sotto, Vicente \\"Tito\\" Sotto III, and Marcelino \\"Maru\\" Sotto Jr. Career Early career He started his career as a folk singer and guitarist. During these years, Sotto was also the lead vocalist of the disco funk band VST & Company. He produced such songs as \\"Awitin Mo At Isasayaw Ko\\", \\"Rock Baby Rock\\", and \\"Kung Sakali\\". He joined his brothers Tito and Val in the early 1970s gag show OK Lang under IBC 13. This is where he met another comedian, Joey de Leon, who invited the brothers to join him. The trio of Tito, Vic and Joey (TVJ) was thus formed, casting in Iskul Bukol, TVJ (Television's Jesters), Rock and Roll 2000 and hosting Eat Bulaga!. Tito, Vic and Joey In 1976, the Sotto brothers Tito, Vic and Val were invited by former OK Lang co-star Joey de Leon to co-host an episode of GMA Network's late afternoon variety show Discorama hosted by Bobby Ledesma. Only Tito and Vic accepted de Leon's invitation. The newly formed trio began to do comedy newscast segments interspersed with Top 40 hit-song parodies. Originally, the trio's appearance was supposed to be a one-off invitation as Discorama was set to be axed but after getting good feedback from the viewers and ratings were high, the show was given a new lease on life by GMA management. The trio was later invited to become part of the noontime show Student Canteen as they released 12 albums based on their Discorama Tough Hits segment. The sitcom Iskul Bukol that gave them nationwide fame as comedians. Soon after, other TV and movie offers came knocking on the trio's door. In 1979, Tito, Vic and Joey began hosting the noontime show Eat Bulaga!, which was pitted against the more established Student Canteen. Not long after, Eat Bulaga! toppled Student Canteen from the ratings. The trio is still active on both Holy Week Dramas every Lenten Season and also on comedy variety show on Eat Bulaga!. Later career In the last three decades, he has done sitcoms and television shows for three networks, ABS-CBN, GMA Network and TV5 (most of which were for GMA). Personal life Sotto has five children from various relationships. He also has seven grandchildren (two from Danica, four from Oyo, and one from Paulina). Sotto confirmed his engagement to Eat Bulaga! co-host Pauleen Luna in September 2015. The couple married on January 30, 2016 at Ayala Alabang, Muntinlupa City. On May 6, 2017, Sotto announced on Eat Bulaga! that he and Luna were expecting their first child together. Controversies Pepsi Paloma gang rape case In 1982 the 15-year old actress Pepsi Paloma accused Sotto and fellow comedians Joey de Leon and Richie D'Horsie of gang raping and taking photos of her on June 21 in a room at the Sulo Hotel in Quezon City. On July 31, Paloma's manager Rey dela Cruz lodged a formal complaint with Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. On August 18, Paloma filed charges of rape and acts of lasciviousness against the three television personalities before the Quezon City fiscal's office. The crime of rape at the time, carried the death penalty in the Philippines, and to prevent his brother from being sent to the electric chair, Tito Sotto quickly went to see Paloma while she was still securing the services of Atty. Rene Cayetano. According to Paloma, Tito Sotto coerced her into signing an \\"Affidavit of Desistance\\" to drop the rape charges against his brother and cohorts‚ÄîTito Sotto had allegedly placed a pistol on the table in front of Paloma when he went to talk to her. In exchange for the dismissal of the charges of rape, Vic Sotto, de Leon and D'Horsie issued a public apology to Paloma: Despite the suspects' earlier apology, Tito Sotto has maintained his position against any involvement in the whitewashing of the rape case and alleges that the scandal was a gimmick by Paloma's party for publicity. Again, in spite of a live apology issued to the people, Sotto said that he was not involved as a perpetrator in the rape of Paloma and he denied using his position in government to influence the court decision. Sotto became Vice Mayor in Quezon City in 1988 before being elected as a Senator in 1992. In 2018, Sotto requested The Philippine Inquirer to remove published articles available online mentioning the Pepsi Paloma Case, claiming them to be \\"fake news\\" (though clearly was not the case), and damaging to his current reputation as a Senator. Three years later, Paloma was found dead in an apparent suicide, though evidence suggests this was actually murder in order to prevent her from testifying against Sotto in court. Dela Cruz was murdered years later. Filmography Film {  - ! Year !! Title !! Role !!

The algorithms for solving sequence mining problems are mostly based on the apriori (level-wise) algorithm. One way to use the level- wise paradigm is to first discover all the frequent items in a level-wise fashion. It simply means counting the occurrences of all singleton elements in the database. Then, the transactions are filtered by removing the non-frequent items. At the end of this step, each transaction consists of only the frequent elements it originally contained. This modified database becomes an input to the GSP algorithm. This process requires one pass over the whole database. GSP algorithm makes multiple database passes. In the first pass, all single items (1-sequences) are counted. From the frequent items, a set of candidate 2-sequences are formed, and another pass is made to identify their frequency. The frequent 2-sequences are used to generate the candidate 3-sequences, and this process is repeated until no more frequent sequences are found. There are two main steps in the algorithm. * Candidate Generation. Given the set of frequent (k-1)-frequent sequences Fk-1, the candidates for the next pass are generated by joining F(k-1) with itself. A pruning phase eliminates any sequence, at least one of whose subsequences is not frequent. * Support Counting. Normally, a hash tree-based search is employed for efficient support counting. Finally non-maximal frequent sequences are removed.  Algorithm  F1 = the set of frequent 1-sequence k=2, do while Fk-1 != Null; Generate candidate sets Ck (set of candidate k-sequences); For all input sequences s in the database D do Increment count of all a in Ck if s supports a End do Fk = {a ‚àà Ck such that its frequency exceeds the threshold} k = k+1; End do Result = Set of all frequent sequences is the union of all Fk's The above algorithm looks like the Apriori algorithm. One main difference is however the generation of candidate sets. Let us assume that: ::A ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí C are two frequent 2-sequences. The items involved in these sequences are (A, B) and (A,C) respectively. The candidate generation in a usual Apriori style would give (A, B, C) as a 3-itemset, but in the present context we get the following 3-sequences as a result of joining the above 2- sequences ::A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C, A ‚Üí C ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí BC The candidate-generation phase takes this into account. The GSP algorithm discovers frequent sequences, allowing for time constraints such as maximum gap and minimum gap among the sequence elements. Moreover, it supports the notion of a sliding window, i.e., of a time interval within which items are observed as belonging to the same event, even if they originate from different events.

History  It was created as \\"Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Psychiatrie\\" (DFA) in 1917, and incorporated into the Kaiser Wilhelm Society 1925 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Psychiatry. In 1954, the institute became affiliated with the Max Planck Society and became the \\"Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (DFA)\\". A few years later, the institute was divided into a Clinical and a Theoretical Institute. In 1984, the Theoretical Institute moved to Martinsried (Planegg), southwest of Munich. In 1998, the Theoretical and the Clinical parts of this institute segregated and the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology became an independent institute.  Scientific Focus  Scientific research at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology is grouped into five departments and several independent research groups. Numerous thematic connections between the groups result in a multitude of interactions and joint projects. About one third of the approximately 300 members of the institute come from abroad.  Departments  * For the brain to be able to recognize sensory information as such and to process them accordingly, its nerve cells need to be connected in a specific way. The department Genes - Circuits - Behavior, led by Professor Herwig Baier investigates how the information flow in such neuronal circuits steers the behavior of the organism. The central research focus lies thus on the genetic, molecular and cellular foundations of animal behavior. * The department Synapses - Circuits - Plasticity, led by Professor Tobias Bonhoeffer pursues the question ‚Äúwhat happens, when the brain learns?‚Äù. Unlike a static object, the structure of the brain constantly changes according to current requirements. For example, in order to learn something, the contact between single nerve cells needs to be strengthened. This is accomplished in part through the creation of new contact sites and their information-transmission sites, the synapses. The basic principles and mechanisms of this plasticity are explored in this department. * How optical input is processed in a fly‚Äôs brain is investigated in Professor Alexander Borst‚Äôs department Circuits - Computation - Models. The ‚Äúcockpit‚Äù of a fly is amazing: During its speedy flight, optical information is analyzed and processed and aversion maneuvers induced within split seconds ‚Äì and all of this is done with a brain that fits easily inside a pin head. The scientists investigate how these cells accomplish their complex tasks through a combination of physiological measurements, the latest techniques in microscopy, and computer simulations. The observed circuits prove interesting also for applications in robotics. * A real understanding of biological processes is generally only possible when these processes are studied at the site of their occurrence - in the living tissue. Optical microscopy allows the high-resolution visualization of such processes on the cellular and molecular level. The department Electrons - Photons - Neurons, led by Professor Winfried Denk, works on the enhancement of existing microscopes and the development of new microscopic methods. * The department Molecules - Signaling - Development, led by Professor R√ºdiger Klein investigates the molecular mechanisms of cell communication in the nervous system. The development of something so complex like the nervous system is only possible with a highly functional cell communication. Likewise, an effective communication between neighboring as well as between more distanced cells is essential for day-to-day survival. Part of the investigations to unravel these functions includes the role of receptor tyrosine kinase in the growth and function of nerve cells.  Emeritus and External Scientific Members  The institute‚Äôs scientific reputation is also based on six well- known professors, who work regularly or permanently at the institute. The institute‚Äôs webpage provides more information about the Emeritus Scientific Members (Prof. Bert Sakmann and Prof. Hartmut Wekerle) and the External Scientific Members (Prof. Yves-Alain Barde, Prof. Reinhard Hohlfeld and Prof. Edvard Moser).  Cooperation  In addition to the manifold internal cooperation is the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology linked through numerous projects to its neighboring institutes. The Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry is situated directly next door on the Martinsried campus. Other institutes such as the University Hospital Gro√ühadern, the Gene- und Biological-Centers of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Innovation and Startup Center for Biotechnology (IZB) are only a few minutes walk away. Close cooperation also exists between the institute and the Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation (ICNC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel), the University of California, San Diego (USA), and the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience (Munich, Germany). Together with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Max Planck - Hebrew University Center \\"Sensory Processing of the Brain in Action\\" was founded in 2013. A lively international exchange is, among others, realized via several student-exchange programs with cooperating institutes. The participation in graduate school programs and the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) assure the efficient and comprehensive education of PhD students.  Public relations  The Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology attempts to render its research as transparent to the public as possible. The institute‚Äôs website informs in short news texts about ongoing work and events. Once every two years, the institute opens its doors to the general public on open day. Visitor groups and school classes can gain insight into the work at the institute and see what it's like to be a scientist in the hands-on- laboratory MaxLab.

Laurier has a second campus in Brantford, Ontario, and recently has opened a third campus in Milton, Ontariohttps://www.wlu.ca/about/campuses-and-locations/milton.html as well as offices in Kitchener, Toronto, Yellowknife and Chongqing, China. It is named in honour of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the seventh Prime Minister of Canada. The university offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a variety of fields, with over 15,000 full-time undergraduate students, over 1000 full‚Äëtime grad students and nearly 4,000 part-time students as of Fall 2019. Laurier's varsity teams, known as the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks, compete in the West Conference of the Ontario University Athletics, affiliated to the U Sports. Laurier landmark sign, at the corner of King Street North and Bricker Avenue History First year students of Waterloo College standing outside Willison Hall in 1947 In 1910, the Lutheran Synod established a seminary, which opened to students in 1911, as the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary of Eastern Canada. In 1914 the seminary developed non-theological courses under the name \\"the Waterloo College School\\". In 1924, the Waterloo College of Arts was established. Waterloo College of Arts became affiliated with the University of Western Ontario (\\"Western\\") in 1925 and soon began to offer honours degree programs in the arts. In 1960, the Lutheran church relinquished its sponsorship of Waterloo College obtained a revised charter changing the name of the seminary to Waterloo Lutheran University. On November 1, 1973, the name was again changed to Wilfrid Laurier University when the relevant provincial law was given Royal Assent by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario Ross Macdonald, who later served as Laurier's Chancellor. Waterloo Lutheran University's seminary and theological programs continued to be offered by the affiliated Waterloo Lutheran Seminary (now Martin Luther University College). Laurier's school colours, purple and gold, extend from its early affiliation with Western; originally maroon and gold, the school adopted purple in lieu of maroon to honour its link with Western, whose colours were purple and white. While Laurier's colours remain, it ended its affiliation with Western in 1960. Expansion Laurier opened a second campus, in Brantford, Ontario, in 1999, and in 2006 the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of Social Work moved from the Waterloo campus to a campus in downtown Kitchener. The Brantford campus is centred on a number of historic properties in the downtown area which have been restored for university use. They include a former Carnegie library, Brantford's 1880 post office, and 1870 mansion, and a 1950 Odeon Theatre. The Kitchener campus is located in the historic and fully renovated former St. Jerome's high school building. On April 18, 2018, Wilfrid Laurier University was granted approval for a new campus location in Milton, Ontario. In partnership with Conestoga College, the new campus will be built in the Milton Education Village. According to WLU's webpage on the Milton campus with respect to program offerings, \\"In fall 2017, the university's Board of Governors endorsed the Laurier Milton proposal, and the university Senate approved a Milton Academic Plan in principle. This academic plan aligns with the province's desire to offer programming with a focus on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. This plan, however, was scrapped due to budget cuts that the conservative government made. They decided not to expand on three other separate campuses for other Canadian universities as well. (STEAM).\\" 2017‚Äì18 freedom of speech controversy In November 2017, the university became the subject of a free speech and academic freedom controversy for censuring a teaching assistant, Lindsay Shepherd, who used a three-minute recording of a debate involving Jordan Peterson about the compelled use of gender-neutral pronouns in a communications class. The case was criticized by several newspaper editorial boards and national newspaper columnists as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. After the release of the audio recording of the meeting in which the TA was censured, WLU President Deborah MacLatchy and the TA's supervising professor Nathan Rambukkana published letters of formal apology. An independent investigation found the teaching assistant had not violated university policies. It also found that the subsequent meeting held by several professors berating her for using the recording was conducted with \\"significant overreach.\\" Peterson and Shepherd are each suing the university as well as the professors who were involved. Two of the professors have filed a third-party claim against Shepherd. Academics The university has an enrolment of about 17,000 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, and over 1,500 full-time and part-time graduate students. It has over 500 faculty and staff members. Laurier has been transitioning from a primarily undergraduate university to a mid-size research university. In the 2021 Maclean's magazine survey of Canadian universities, Laurier was ranked eighth out of 15 Canadian universities in the magazine's comprehensive university category. The Registrar's Report for Winter 2016 indicates that the six most popular majors at Laurier, across the entire university, were (in order): Business, Communications Studies, Psychology, Criminology, Economics, and Biology. The internationally renowned Faculty of Music at Laurier is considered one of the best in the country,. A September 2017 report indicated that students could choose to concentrate in Composition; Comprehensive; Music Education; Music History, Theory & Critical Analysis; Performance; or Community Music. Second year Bachelor of Music students could take Music Therapy as an option. In addition, Laurier is home to the Penderecki String Quartet - an internationally recognised group playing largely new compositions. The music faculty boasts two performance spaces, the Theatre Auditorium and the Maureen Forrester Recital Hall (named after the famous contralto and former chancellor of Laurier). The faculty also attracts a greater percentage of students from outside Ontario than any other faculty at Laurier. Laurier's music program offers the only master's degree in Music Therapy. Laurier's strength in \\"music and business education\\" has been identified as one of the reasons that the Waterloo Region is a \\"powerful educational hub\\" by former University of Waterloo president, and former Governor-General of Canada, David Johnston. Laurier was named Canada's Best Music Campus by CBC Radio in 2013. { center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px\\"  + Demographics of student body (2015‚Äì16) ! !!

Laurier was the headquarters of the Academic Council of the United Nations System (ACUNS). The ACUNS' goal is to strengthen the study of international organizations and to create strong ties between the academic community and diplomats within international organizations. The Balsillie School of International Affairs, opened in Uptown Waterloo in 2008, is a partnership between Laurier, the University of Waterloo, and the Centre for International Governance Innovation. The Balsillie School offers three programs: a masters in arts in global governance, a masters in international public policy and a PhD program in global governance. Cooperative education Laurier has the oldest business cooperative education (\\"co-op\\") program in English-speaking Canada and the largest business co-op program in Canada. Students are able to enjoy co-op opportunities with dozens of companies, including KPMG, Ernst and Young, PepsiCo, Scotiabank, Unilever, and Manulife Financial. Laurier Library As of the 2014-2015 Annual Report, the Laurier Library holds 1 million print volumes, 312,000 electronic books, 68,000 electronic journals, and 280 databases, thousands of media titles (about 5,000 including streaming and DVDs). In addition, the library is a member of the TriUniversity Group of Libraries (University of Waterloo, University of Guelph, Wilfrid Laurier University), through which access to a combined information collection in excess of seven million print items is available. There are three physical locations for the Library: the Waterloo Campus's primary library (on the west end of the campus, housing the majority of the collection and the majority of the librarians and staff), the Brantford Campus' Digital Library and Learning Commons space (in Grand River Hall, which includes offices for the librarians on that campus) and the collection space in the Brantford Public Library (on the first and second floors), and the Social Work Library in Kitchener. The library, in conjunction with Wilfrid Laurier University Press, hosts Scholars Commons @ Laurier, an institutional repository that aims to support open scholarly communication, collaboration, and lasting visibility and recognition for Laurier scholarship. It houses faculty scholarship, theses, dissertations, online journals, and an archival collection of The Cord dating back to 1926. Campuses Waterloo campus The main campus in Waterloo Laurier Food Court Laurier Central Garden with Sir Wilfrid Laurier statue The Lazaridis School of Business & Economics is the business school of Wilfrid Laurier, and is located in Waterloo, Ontario. With more than 160 full-time and 60 part-time faculty. the school is the largest faculty at Wilfrid. As of 2018, the School had over 30,000 alumni. In 2010, it was named an \\"outstanding business school\\" by The Princeton Review, which acknowledged that \\"We are pleased to recommend Laurier as one of the best institutions students could attend to earn an MBA\\". The School is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International) for all of its Undergraduate, Master's, and Ph.D programs. ;Locations The Waterloo campus is located west of Toronto and offers full-time and part-time PhD, MBA, Master's, Economics and Honours BBA; the Brantford, Ontario campus offers a Bachelor of Business Technology Management program (as part of the Lazaridis School). Diploma programs in Accounting and Business Administration are also offered by the Lazaridis School. ;History Originally the \\"School of Business & Economics,\\" it was renamed in September 2015 after Mike Lazaridis, co-founder of Research In Motion, and former Chancellor of the University of Waterloo. The re-branding followed a 2015 announcement of his pledge of $20-million for a new technology-focused management institute at the business school. In 2016, the School moved to a new building facility, the Lazaridis Hall building, at 200 University Avenue West in Waterloo. ;Collaboration A program in association with the University of Waterloo confers double degrees. The Lazaridis School offers a part-time MBA program in downtown Toronto at the St. Andrew's Club and Conference Centre. Laurier's Waterloo Campus is located in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. The majority of the University's faculties reside at the Waterloo Campus, including Business, Arts, Science, Music, and Health. Altogether, approximately 15,000 students attend classes at the Waterloo campus. ;Residences King Street Residence Laurier Waterloo operates one all female residence (Leupold Residence), one all male residence (Euler Residence), and multiple co-ed student residences: Bouckaert Hall, Bricker Residence, Clara Conrad Hall, Hickory St. Apartments, King's Court Residence, King Street Residence, CH Little House, Macdonald House, Marshall Street Apartments, Regina Residence, Regina Towers, Spruce Street Apartments, University Place Residence, Waterloo College Hall, Willison Hall. Together, these residences house approximately 2,780 men and women, with 2,664 beds reserved for undergraduate first-year students. When applying to residences, students can choose to be a part of a Residence Learning Community, a themed residence environment where all members share a common interest, major, or coursework. These communities are designed to extend opportunities for learning and development beyond the classroom, mainly through networking opportunities with peers, faculty, and staff. Residence Life currently operates the following communities: Global: Thinking Global, Acting Local, Innovation: Entrepreneurship, Languages and Literatures, School of Business and Economics, Faculty of Science, Singer and Songwriter, The Reel World: English and Film Studies, and Vimy Hall: War, Memory and the Canadian Military Experience. Brantford campus Laurier's Brantford Campus is located in Brantford, Ontario, approximately 50 km south of the campus in Waterloo. The campus opened its doors in 1999 with a total of 39 students in its inaugural year. As of January 2015, there were 2,625 full-time students, and an unstated number of part-time students, enrolled at the school. In late 2017, Laurier estimated a total of over 3,000 students. According to Maclean's, Laurier's \\"Standout Programs\\" in 2017-2018 included Game Design and Development at the Brantford campus. \\"The program develops skills not only in game design, project management and entrepreneurship, but also considers how transformative games are used in areas such as education, corporate training, health care and more.\\" ;Residences Brantford campus has the following apartment-style residences: * Grand River Hall * Post House * Lawyer's Hall * Lucy Marco Place * Expositor Place Kitchener campus Home of Faculty of Social Work, downtown Kitchener. Formerly St. Jerome's high school. In the Fall of 2006 the Faculty of Social Work (previously on the Waterloo campus) moved to downtown Kitchener. Located on Duke St. it moved into the old St. Jerome's High School which was designated a heritage site by the City of Kitchener. This move allowed the students to be closer to the community and social service agencies with which they are partnered. Also in an effort to partner better with the community and make the building more welcoming, faculty and staff held such events as the Political Coffee House Series, several all-candidates debates and the Expressions of Social Justice Festival Planned Milton campus The town of Milton, Ontario and Laurier have worked together since 2008 to develop a 150-acre campus in Milton within the planned Milton Education Village (MEV) on land donated by the town. In April 2018, the provincial party then in power announced a funding plan ($90 million) for the MEV that would accommodate a satellite campus of the university and also of Conestoga College, a recent partner in the project. Construction was expected to conclude in Q3 of 2021; in the meantime, Laurier would offer credit courses in rented premises, commencing in September 2019. In October 2018, the new Conservative government, elected in June 2018, withdrew the funding before any construction had begun, citing a greater than expected provincial deficit, effectively canceling plans for the Milton campus. Mayor Gordon Krantz said the town would explore alternatives for funding the Milton Education Village campus. A Laurier news release said that the university would continue working with the town and other partners to find an alternate solution to fund the campus. As of 2019, Laurier was offering some services in Milton, including a Master of Education program at the Milton Education Village Innovation Centre and a Lecture Series. In summer, Laurier was operating the Enriched Academic Program (LEAP) day camp. Campus safety A 2015 survey found that 40% of Wilfrid Laurier students had experienced gendered violence, and 13.4% of Wilfrid Laurier students had experienced sexual assault. Also in 2015, Wilfrid Laurier University was criticized for allowing a male student accused of raping a female student in her dorm room to continue to attend classes alongside his accuser. Athletics The university is represented in Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks. The history of the team name (Golden Hawks) dates back to the 1961. For many years, the Waterloo College teams were called simply the Waterloo College teams, although sometimes they were called the Purple and Gold and other times the Waterloons. In 1950, the college's newspaper mused that a name was needed, and in December 1951 a new name was tested: the Mules. Subsequently, the hockey team became the Ice Mules and the women's basketball and volleyball teams were known as the Mulettes. In 1960, with the shift from college to university status, the university student newspaper again lobbied for change. At a meeting that year, somebody suggested Golden Hawks and that was the name adopted. A headline in the January 16, 1961 issue of the newspaper read \\"From 'Jackass' to 'Bird of Prey'\\". On November 13, 2004, the Golden Hawks football team won the Yates Cup against the McMaster Marauders at University Stadium in front of a record crowd of 8,175. It was the sixth Yates Cup victory for Laurier in its history. The game also ended McMaster's four-year Ontario championship winning streak. The men's football team scored a second successive Yates Cup victory in November, 2005, followed by a victory in the Uteck Bowl against Acadia. The Hawks then defeated the University of Saskatchewan Huskies 24‚Äì23 to win the 2005 Vanier Cup, their first since 1991. Laurier's first female national championship was won in 1992 by the women's soccer team, which followed that up with their second CIS title in 1995. The men's soccer team claimed back-to- back national championships in 2000 & 2001. In 2007 the women's lacrosse team won their fifth OUA Ontario University Athletics gold medal in a row. In February 2008, the women's hockey team claimed its fifth gold medal in as many years and seventh since 1998. The women's hockey team won its first CIS national championship in 2005. Both teams have since won sixth consecutive championships in their respective sports. In 2008 both the men's and women's curling teams won the inaugural CIS Championships and represented Canada in China at the 2009 World University Games. The women's team repeated as CIS Champion's in 2009 in Montreal and went on to represent Canada in the Karuizawa International Curling championships where they claimed first place. Facilities The athletic facilities at Wilfrid Laurier University include an Athletic Complex, a Football Stadium and an outdoor multi-purpose fieldturf field. The Athletic Complex houses three Gyms, two squash courts, an Olympic- size swimming pool, a rock-climbing Wall, and Aerobics/Weight Rooms. University Stadium includes a fieldturf football field and a large indoor gymnasium.  School song  Laurier's school song is Laurier We‚Äôll Praise Thee Ever (originally titled Waterloo We‚Äôll Praise Thee Ever). It was written by Maxwell A. Magee in 1938.Magee, M. A., Walter H. Johns, and Fred. Nichols. ‚ÄúLaurier We‚Äôll Praise Thee Ever : Original Title ‚ÄòWaterloo We‚Äôll Praise Thee Ever‚Äô : (Waterloo College Song) .‚Äù 2005: n. pag. Print. (OCLC: 613500293) The song was revived in 2005 by the WLU Alumni Choir and the words were adapted to reflect the change from Waterloo College to Wilfrid Laurier University. Students' Union The Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union (WLUSU) represents undergraduate students at both campuses of Wilfrid Laurier University. It operates the Fred Nichols Campus Centre in Waterloo as well as the Students' Centre on Laurier's Brantford Campus. Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union's Arms, Supporters, Flag and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on January 15, 2003. WLUSU is funded by undergraduate student fees, and all students are automatically members. Their mission is to enhance the holistic student experience at Wilfrid University by providing innovative resources and effective representation within a safe and empowering campus community. The Students' Union provides a number of services for students, including bus passes, Direct2U Prescription, emergency response team, food bank, foot patrol, health and dental insurance coverage, the member card, peer-help line, student life line, and tech share. The Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union Clubs and Associations department supports over 130 clubs and associations involving over 3,000 students. Clubs and Associations supports all clubs by offering resources and financial support as well as acting as a liaison to the Students' Union and University administration. The Students' Union's University Affairs department is responsible for political advocacy at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels of government, with provincial advocacy supported by the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance. Alumni Laurier has over 100,000 graduates from 85 countries. Among the notable alumni is Sam Schachter, an Olympic beach volleyball player, and stock exchange founder Brad Katsuyama.

At the time of his death he was Ireland's oldest man and the last surviving veteran of the Irish War of Independence. Republican activity Keating joined Fianna √âireann in 1918. In 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, he joined the Boherbee B Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Kerry Brigade, Irish Republican Army (IRA). He first bought a firearm from a Liverpool Irish soldier of the British Army in a public house, in which he worked. On 21 April 1921, Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Constable Denis O'Loughlin was shot dead in Knightly's public house in Tralee. Keating, Jimmy O'Connor and Percy Hanafin were suspected of the killing, and were forced to go on the run. On 1 June, Keating was involved in an ambush between Castlemaine and Milltown which claimed the lives of five RIC men. On 10 July, a day before the truce between the IRA and British forces, Keating's unit was involved in a gun battle with the British Army near Castleisland. This confrontation resulted in the deaths of four British soldiers and five IRA volunteers. McKenna, J, The IRA Bombing Campaign Against Britain, 1939‚Äì1940. Pg 172 McFarland, Incorporated Publishers. 2016. Keating opposed the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought on the anti-treaty side in the Irish Civil War. He was involved in operations in Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary, before his column was arrested by Free State Forces. Keating spent seven months in Portlaoise Prison and the Curragh Prison before being released in March 1923. Keating remained an IRA member for a long time after the Civil War. He was arrested several times during the 1930s on various charges. Keating was active in London during the 1939/1940 IRA bombing campaign. In 1933, he was involved in an attempt to assassinate the leader of the Irish Blueshirts, Eoin O'Duffy, during a visit to County Kerry. The attack was to happen at Ballyseedy, where Free State forces had carried out the Ballyseedy Massacre during the Irish Civil War. However, the plot failed when the person travelling with O'Duffy refused to divulge what car the latter would be travelling in. Later life Keating subsequently returned to Dublin and worked as a barman in several public houses. He retired and returned to his native Kerry in 1978, living out the rest of his life with relatives in Knockbrack. Until his death he refused to accept a state pension because he considered the 26-county Republic of Ireland an illegitimate state which usurped the 1916 Irish Republic. \\"All the talk you hear these days is of peace. But there will never be peace until the people of the 32 counties elect one parliament without British interference.\\"* Obituary in The Guardian, 15 October 2007 In 2002, he refused the state's standard ‚Ç¨2,500 award to centenarians from President Mary McAleese. After former IRA volunteer George Harrison died in November 2004, Keating became patron of Republican Sinn F√©in until his own death. By the time of his death he was the oldest man in Ireland. He was buried in Kiltallagh Cemetery, Castlemaine.

In 1902, he completed his major work, a drama entitled Vlaicu VodƒÉ (based on the life of a 14th-century Wallachian Prince), one of the first important pieces of its kind in Romanian literature. Between 1905 and 1908, he was the head of the National Theatre Bucharest. In 1915, a mysterious attempt to have him killed resulted in paralysis -- Davila was bedridden for the rest of his life, as a sanatorium patient. An intimate friend of the royal family under Carol I, he left behind his Din torsul zilelor, a memoir of life at the turn of the century (alongside his portrait of Carol, the book is remembered for those of figures such as Take Ionescu, Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, and Vasile Mor≈£un).

Dex is best known as one-half of the seminal two-piece Flat Duo Jets. He fronted the Dex Romweber Duo with his older sister Sara Romweber.  Early life and education  Romweber was born in Batesville, Indiana, the youngest of seven children. His older brother Joe Romweber was the lead singer for UV Prom, while his sister Sara Romweber was a member of Let's Active and a founding member of Snatches of Pink. Romweber's first band, Crash Landon and The Kamikazes, was started at the age of 11 while attending Culbreth Junior High, with stand-up bassist Tony Mayer (since of the Good Old Chicken Wire Gang Boys Band) and drummer Hunter Landon (now of the Bad Checks).  Career   The Flat Duo Jets  Dexter began playing with Chris \\"Crow\\" Smith, with material culled mainly from his family's record collection. They called themselves The Flat Duo Jets, after hearing Gene Vincent refer to his Gretsch Duo Jet guitar. The Flat Duo Jets' first release, In Stereo, was recorded live in the studio in 1985 and originally released on cassette by Dolphin Records. The band was also featured around this time on MTV's The Cutting Edge, in a segment directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who later went on to direct Little Miss Sunshine). Relocating shortly to Athens, Georgia, the band made an appearance in the film Athens, GA: Inside Out, alongside other well-known Athens bands such as R.E.M. and The B-52's. Though recorded live to two tracks in a garage in the late 80s, the band's full-length debut LP, the self-titled Flat Duo Jets, was not released until 1990. In support of the album, the Flat Duo Jets went on a national tour opening for The Cramps, whom Dexter has cited as an early influence. 1990 also saw the band make an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman, where they performed a high-energy cover of Benny Joy's \\"Wild Wild Lover\\". Their second LP, Go Go Harlem Baby, was produced by Jim Dickinson in 1992, and has been acknowledged as a huge influence on Jack White of The White Stripes, not least in the documentary It Might Get Loud. In the film, Jack White plays the record for Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and U2's The Edge, playing the Flat Duo Jets' version of the traditional \\"Froggie Went A-Courtin'\\" and discussing the impact that the band had on him. The film also features footage from their appearance in Athens, GA: Inside/Out. In the late 1990s, The Flat Duo Jets signed a major label contract with Outpost Records, a now defunct imprint of Geffen Records. The result was 1998's Lucky Eye, produced by Scott Litt and Chris Stamey, which demonstrated a markedly different approach from their previous lo-fi efforts. The album featured a more polished sound for the band, accompanied by horn and string arrangements. Poor album sales were met with disappointment by the band, and it was shortly after the release that, after nearly 15 years as a band, Dexter and Crow went separate ways. Dexter maintains that the primary reason for the split was embezzlement of the band's proceeds on the part of Crow, though Crow disputes this.  Solo projects  In 2001, Dexter finally resurfaced with a new solo album, Chased By Martians, followed by Blues That Defy My Soul in 2004. Around this time, Dexter's influence was beginning to surface in interviews with artists like Neko Case, Cat Power and Jack White. Dexter has described his reaction to this influence as like being \\"locked away in a Gothic castle for many years\\" and \\"living in such isolation that I haven't even noticed.\\" In 2006, Dexter released the album Piano, which consisted of 13 original classical piano compositions in the style of Chopin. Also in 2006, a documentary about Dex and The Flat Duo Jets began playing at film festivals. Upon completion of Athens, GA: Inside/Out in 1987, director Tony Gayton began filming an untitled documentary of the Flat Duo Jets' national tour. After funding for the film fell through, production ceased and the film was forgotten. Funding the rest of the film himself, Gayton met up with Dexter in Los Angeles sixteen years later, and filmed new interviews with the intention of completing the film. The film, entitled Two Headed Cow, was eventually completed using a recovered VHS version of the original 16mm black- and-white footage, edited together with new interviews with Dexter, detailing his life and career, as well as performances in and around Los Angeles and interviews with Jack White, Exene Cervenka of X, Cat Power and Neko Case. As of 2009, the film has yet to be picked up for distribution, though it had a brief run on DOC: The Documentary Channel. Dexter's current band, The Dex Romweber Duo, began as Dexter and drummer Crash LaResh, who performed with Dexter from 1995 to 2007. The original Duo toured extensively and recorded several 7 inch releases and recorded two full length albums (Chased By Martians and Blues That Defy My Soul), but these were credited as solo Dex Romweber releases. Crash LaResh left the band in 2007 and was replaced by Dexter's sister, Sara Romweber. In 2009, the pair released their debut album, Ruins of Berlin, on Bloodshot Records. The album featured guest appearances from Exene Cervenka, Cat Power, Neko Case, and longtime friend Rick Miller of Southern Culture on the Skids. The band toured the U.S. twice in support of the record, playing support for The Detroit Cobras on the second tour. On the 29th and 30 April 2009, Dex and Sara were invited to record at Jack White's Third Man Records in Nashville, Tennessee, and they put out a 7-inch vinyl as part of Third Man Records' new \\"Blue Series\\". The sessions resulted in the Romweber original \\"The Wind Did Move\\", featuring Jack White on bass, background vocals and the saw, while the record's b-side was a cover of 1930s blues woman Geeshie Wiley's \\"Last Kind Word Blues\\", on which Dex and Jack share guitar and vocal duties. It was released on vinyl on June 9, 2009, and on iTunes shortly after. Dexter and Sara also returned to Nashville in 2010 to play a show at Jack White's live venue. The show was recorded onto 8-track reel-to-reel analog tape and is available on vinyl from Third Man Records. In 2011 the Dex Romweber Duo released their second album on Bloodshot Records, titled Is That You In The Blue?. Romweber also fronts Dexter Romweber and The New Romans, an ensemble of 7 musicians and 3 female backing vocalists that began in 2006. They have released one limited CD called \\"Night Tide\\" and mainly play shows in their home state of North Carolina, more specifically in The Research Triangle area of Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Durham. The music is diverse, drawing influences from jazz, surf, early instrumentals, Bill Haley, Ella Fitzgerald, and even Chopin. The band continues to rehearse and experiment every Thursday night in Romweber's garage. In 2016, Romweber released the record Carrboro on Bloodshot Records.  Equipment  Romweber plays the Silvertone 1448.

The body of this shark is slightly compressed, and its rostrum is narrow. The two dorsal fins are almost identical in size. In color, the dorsal side of this sawshark tends to be uniformly slate gray, with few or no markings. The ventral side is pale white or cream. Females reach around long, and males reach around long. These sharks can live up to 9 years. Behavior Leading a benthic lifestyle, the shortnose sawshark primarily feeds on benthic invertebrates and small bony fish. Like other sawsharks, this species' reproduction is ovoviviparous. It gives birth biannually to a litter of 7-14 pups. The size of pups at birth is about . Conservation Because of stable commercial catch rates, reduced Total Allowable Catch, protection in Victorian waters, and a high rate of biological productivity, the shortnose sawshark is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. While the shortnose sawhark is fairly popular commercially, the largest threat to the species is being caught as bycatch in gillnet operations.

He designed elements of World of Warcraft and is the lead designer on Overwatch. Early life Kaplan was born in New Jersey but raised in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California. Kaplan had been an avid video game player during his school years, particularly influenced by the various Infocom adventure games; however, lacking programming skills, he never thought he would be able to get a career in the video game industry. He initially pursued a degree in film, but ultimately got a degree in creative writing at the University of Southern California. After working as a writing intern for Universal Pictures, he decided to get a graduate degree for creative writing from New York University. Following this, he worked for his father's recruiting business while performing creative writing on the side to try to get his stories published. He was unsuccessful at getting any of his creative stories published for several years, receiving over 170 rejection notices in a single year. By 2000, he decided to drop creative writing, and spent his time playing video games, as well as toying around with the level editors from games like Duke Nukem 3D and Half-Life. Career Kaplan became involved in the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) Everquest. Under his online handle \\"Tigole\\", he joined the \\"Legacy of Steel\\" guild, and became a well-recognized player for his accomplishments and his commentary about the game posted to the guild's website. He discussed some of his map making attempts which caught the attention of the guild's leader, Rob Pardo, who at the time was the lead designer at Blizzard for Warcraft III; Kaplan was aware that some of his guild members worked at Blizzard, but he had not recognized the importance of the company at that point. Around 2001, Pardo invited Kaplan to come visit Blizzard's offices in Los Angeles, during which he was introduced to several other Blizzard guild members, and they showed him the yet-unannounced MMO World of Warcraft (WoW) project they had been working on. Several similar meetings happened over the next few months. Later, after World of Warcraft was announced, Pardo suggested that Kaplan apply for a recently- posted job for a WoW quest designer there; Kaplan realized that the job description was tailor-made for his background, and that his previous visit to Blizzard had been an informal job interview. Kaplan applied and was hired into Blizzard by May 2002. Kaplan's initial work at Blizzard was helping with quality assurance for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos in the weeks prior to its release. After Warcraft III shipped, he joined with the WoW team as one of the first two quest designers along with Pat Nagle, and worked closely with the game's creative director Chris Metzen. Kaplan's work focused on the player versus environment elements of WoW, including quest design and the overall aesthetics for the various dungeons and raids; he described his position as a \\"medium\\" between Metzen's creative elements and the programmers and artists of the level design team. Eventually, Kaplan was named as game director for WoW, along with Tom Chilton and J. Allen Brack. In February 2009, Kaplan announced that he was stepping down as game director for WoW to switch his role at Blizzard to a new, unannounced MMO, which later was revealed as Titan. Kaplan opted to jump on the new project, hoping to create a similar success to what WoW had been, as well as having concerns how long WoWs popularity would remain. Titan was considered an ambitious project, designed as a class-based first-person shooter, but had a prolonged and struggling development period along with gameplay that Kaplan called \\"very cluttered and confused\\". Titans cancellation was officially announced in September 2014. However, prior to Titans official cancellation, the game's development had been stopped in early 2013 at Blizzard. All but 40 members of the Titan team were reassigned to other projects, with the remaining people, including Kaplan and Metzen, tasked by management to come up with a new intellectual property within a few weeks, or otherwise they would also be reassigned. Kaplan and Metzen led this team to take some of the gameplay and creative elements of Titan and created a team- based shooter, which became Overwatch. With the project approved by Blizzard, Kaplan became the game's lead director with Metzen serving as creative director. Overwatch became extremely successful for Blizzard, earning more than $1 billion in revenue within its first year, and having drawn more than 35 million players worldwide. Taking a cue from fellow Blizzard employee and lead director for Hearthstone, Ben Brode, Kaplan has made himself the public face for Blizzard in promoting and interacting with fans of Overwatch; he regularly posts to the Overwatch online forums, and has created several videos giving insight into Overwatchs development and future updates. On 2017, Kaplan was awarded with the Vanguard Award at the Fun & Serious Game Festival, which takes place in the Spanish city of Bilbao. Gameography {  - ! Year ! Title ! Role !

Once complete, it will connect the ports of Melbourne and Brisbane along a new route west of the mountainous Great Dividing Range, bypassing the busy Sydney metropolitan area and allowing for the use of double-stacked freight trains. The route will also connect to the Sydney‚ÄìPerth rail corridor, reducing journey times between Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Construction of the line is divided into 13 projects, with of new track to be built and of existing track to be upgraded. History Early proposals In the 20th century, several proposals were made for an inland railway route connecting the east coast of Australia. In 1915, Prime Minister Andrew Fisher proposed a \\"strategic railway\\" connecting the South Australian city of Port Augusta to Brisbane, with connections to the New South Wales railway network, at an estimated cost of A¬£6,500,000. In 1979, TNT founder Ken Thomas proposed a route connecting Brisbane to Melbourne via Wallangarra, Orange and Albury, with possible connections to Adelaide and Perth. Later proposals In 1995, Queensland Rail detailed a $1.289 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) proposal for an inland railway corridor connecting Brisbane and Melbourne. New dual gauge track would follow the existing narrow gauge Main Line to , the Western railway line to Wyreema and the Millmerran railway line to its terminus at Millmerran, with new track connecting to the Boggabilla railway line south of the New South Wales‚ÄìQueensland border. The route would then have continued along the Mungindi railway line until Bellata, with a new line connecting the Coonamble railway line via Wee Waa before once again following existing track: the Main Western railway line to ; the Parkes‚ÄìNarromine railway line to ; the Stockinbingal‚ÄìParkes railway line to ; the Lake Cargelligo railway line to ; the Main Southern railway line to ; and the North East railway line to Melbourne. A maximum line speed of would be in place for the corridor, with an additional $189 million (equivalent to $ million in ) upgrade to existing track allowing for speeds of up to in sections. In 1996, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics (BTCE) released a working paper assessing the proposal. It found a new route would save ten hours journey time on the existing coastal route via Sydney, reducing the operating cost for operators from $23.16/tonne to $17.56/tonne, but would facilitate only a small increase in grain production. In September 2005, the federal Department of Transport and Regional Services commissioned a feasibility study into a Brisbane‚ÄìMelbourne railway link, outlining four possible 'sub- corridors' between and Brisbane. In May 2008, the newly-elected Rudd Government allocated $15 million to the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) to develop a route alignment following the Far Western sub-corridor as detailed in the 2006 study. The Corporation's preliminary analysis was released in May 2009, which showed that the cheapest version of the inland railway would cost $2.8 billion to build and would allow freight to be moved from Melbourne to Brisbane in just over 27 hours. Despite this, the analysis also found that, if operational by 2020, the project's costs would outweigh any economic benefits by up to $1.1 billion. The ARTC's final report was released in July 2010. The report recommended a route from Junee to Melbourne via following the North East railway line, with the route from to Brisbane to built along a new corridor through the Toowoomba range. The report forecast a delivery cost of $3.688 billion, with track duplication works between Junee and Melbourne and capacity for double-stacked freight trains between Melbourne and Parkes already budgeted by the ARTC. Approval and funding The Gillard Government announced forward estimates of $300 million in the 2011 federal budget commencing 2014, with the Coalition committing to the funding following the election of the Abbott Government in 2013. A further $594 million was allocated to ARTC by the Turnbull Government in the 2016 federal budget to purchase land for the project, with an additional $8.4 billion in funding over seven years announced in the subsequent 2017 budget. In the 2020 federal budget, the Morrison Government pledged $150 million in funding for additional grade separation works in New South Wales, conditional upon a further $37.5 million commitment from the New South Wales state government. Route The proposed route will connect the rail yard at Tottenham, Victoria with the freight yards at Acacia Ridge and Bromelton, using a combination of new and existing standard gauge and dual gauge track. Upgrades to existing track will facilitate the use of double-stacked container trains between the three yards. Victoria In Victoria, the Inland Rail route will follow the existing North East railway line and Albion‚ÄìJacana railway line alignment. Between Tottenham and the line is mostly single track with several crossing loops between and in length. The line north of Seymour is double track, with a connection to the Oaklands railway line at . Initial works on the corridor commenced in May 2020 as part of the $235 million North East Rail Line Upgrade, with John Holland contracted to upgrade the track for line speeds up to . Additional works in the corridor include: * Replacing or modifying 12 railway bridges between Beveridge and Albury. * Building new track and relocating platform 2 at . New South Wales From Albury, the route continues along the Main South railway line to Illabo. Initial consultations on this section of the route commenced in 2018, with upgrades planned to of track. of new track is planned to be built between Illabo and Stockinbingal, connecting the Main South railway line to the Stockinbingal‚ÄìParkes railway line and bypassing Cootamundra and the Bethungra Spiral. The route continues along the line to Parkes, with upgrades planned to of track. A further of track has been upgraded between Parkes and Narromine, in addition to the construction of a new connection with the Broken Hill railway line west of Parkes allowing services to connect to Adelaide and Perth. of track between Narromine and Narrabri will be built along a new alignment, and is the longest stage of the project. A further of existing railway between Narrabri and North Star will be upgraded, with a bypass at to remove a long hairpin. Queensland The sections of the route between the New South Wales‚ÄîQueensland border and the termini at Bromelton and Acacia Ridge total and will be built as dual gauge, improving services on both the interstate standard gauge and Queensland narrow gauge networks. South-west of Yelarbon the Inland Rail route joins the alignment of the South Western railway line where it extends to south of Inglewood, with a new alignment connecting the now-closed Milmerran line north-east of Milmerran. New track will be built between Southbrook and Gowrie Junction, with the route bypassing Toowoomba along an upgraded Western line as far east as Kagaru. The existing dual gauge North Coast line between Acacia Ridge and Bromelton will also be upgraded to allow for double-stacked freight containers. Construction Chronology In October 2018, INLink, a joint-venture between BMD Constructions and Fulton Hogan, was awarded a $310 million contract for stage 1 of the project between Parkes and Narromine. Work on the Parkes‚ÄìNarromine railway line and the new Broken Hill railway line connection commenced in December 2018. More than 1,800 people were employed on the project, with works completed in September 2020. Opposition to construction The Narrabri and Baradine Aboriginal Land Councils have stated their opposition to the Narromine to Narrabri section of the project, planned to be built on an alignment through the Pilliga forests which contain various Aboriginal heritage sites. A route through the Pilliga forests was announced by Minister for Infrastructure Darren Chester in November 2017, despite initial plans by the ARTC to build the line through surrounding farmland. Landholders and farmers have opposed several sections of the project on environmental grounds. In September 2017, Chester announced the Yelarbon to Gowrie section would be built through the Condamine River floodplain, which reached its highest recorded level in the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. The Inland Rail project was subsequently referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in 2019, with the committee chair Glenn Sterle critical of ARTC for a lack of consultation with communities along the alignment. While the ARTC reaffirmed the Yelarbon to Gowrie route would remain across the floodplain, in June 2020 Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack ordered a review into the alignment. In July 2020, the New South Wales branch of the Country Women's Association along with the NSW Farmers' Association commenced legal proceedings against ARTC, seeking an independent hydrology review into the Narromine to Narrabri stage of the project.

Delprat attended a high school in Amsterdam and later became an apprentice engineer on the Tay Bridge in Scotland. He attended science classes in Newport-on-Tay and learned calculus from his father by post. On returning to the Netherlands, he is said to have acted as assistant to Johannes Diderik van der Waals, physics professor at the University of Amsterdam. From 1879 to 1882, Delprat worked in Spain at the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Mines. In 1898, chairman E. N.

This shark has a long, narrow rostrum. Its first dorsal fin originates behind the tips of the pectoral fins, and its caudal fin is angled almost straight in line with the body. The Japanese sawshark reaches a maximum length of up to . Range and habitat Found in the northwest Pacific Ocean around Japan, Korea, and northern China between latitudes 48¬∞N and 22¬∞N. It is found over the sandy or muddy bottoms of the continental shelf at depths of . This species may vertically migrate in the water column because of changes in temperature. Behavior The Japanese sawshark has a varied diet of small benthic organisms. Like seemingly all sawsharks, this species is ovoviviparous. After an unknown gestation period, the female shark gives live birth to around 12 pups. These pups average around long. At sexual maturity the male is long, and the female is around long. Conservation With little information on population size or frequency of bycatch, the Japanese sawshark is listed by the IUCN Red List as being Data Deficient. It is not clear if this shark's apparent rarity is because of natural reasons, or because the population has already been depleted. Due to its benthic lifestyle, and because the range of this shark is heavily fished, it is safe to assume that the Japanese sawshark is at considerable risk of being caught as bycatch in bottom trawling and gillnet operations. Because of its habitat and behavior, this shark poses no threat to humans.

Perhaps best known for his 15 fights in the UFC, he was also featured on The Ultimate Fighter 4, after competing for Cage Warriors and Cage Rage in England.  Background  Rivera is from Boston, Massachusetts, then Milford, Massachusetts before finally settling down in Bellingham, Massachusetts. Being one of the ethnic minorities in these towns, the Rivera children often got into street fights. When he was 25 years old, Rivera began training in mixed martial arts.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/621021-ufc-127-fight-card-jorge- rivera-a-hard-knock-life  Military career  19k Tank with A/1-70 Armor at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He helped move the unit from Fort Polk to Fort Hood, Texas before his enlistment ended in 1992.  Mixed martial arts career  Rivera's first sanctioned fight was in 2001, when he was 29 years old against Branden Lee Hinkle in Chester, West Virginia. Lee Hinkle, who had been fighting professionally for three years, also had the legendary Mark Coleman in his corner. Rivera landed a solid straight right hand early, that knocked out Lee Hinkle's mouthpiece and caused him to stumble, but then responded using his wrestling, picking up and slamming Rivera. Lee Hinkle then proceeded to land many punches that caused referee Din Thomas to stop the fight, making Lee Hinkle the winner by TKO. Rivera's first fight in the UFC was a unanimous decision victory over David Loiseau at UFC 44. He then followed up with back- to-back submission losses to Lee Murray at UFC 46 and Rich Franklin at UFC 50 before rebounding with a unanimous decision win over Dennis Hallman at UFC 55. Rivera was defeated by Chris Leben by technical knockout before appearing on The Ultimate Fighter 4 as a Middleweight contestant. Although Rivera was not successful in achieving a slot in the middleweight finals, he appeared on the live card of The Ultimate Fighter 4 Finale, defeating Edwin DeWees by technical knockout in the first round. Jorge then was defeated by Terry Martin by KO via an uppercut at UFC 67, fourteen seconds into round one. Jorge broke his jaw from the knockout punch and did not compete until UFC 80, where he knocked out heavy favorite Kendall Grove in the first round. He went 4‚Äì3 after the upset, with wins over Eric Schafer, Nate Quarry, Nissen Osterneck and submission artist Rob Kimmons, with his only losses since coming from top level opponents Martin Kampmann, Michael Bisping, and Costas Philippou. Rivera was scheduled to face Alessio Sakara on August 28, 2010 at UFC 118, but was forced off the card with an arm injury and replaced by Gerald Harris. Rivera/Sakara was expected to take place on November 13, 2010 at UFC 122. The fight was scrapped the day of the fight due to a 'flu like illness from Sakara. On February 27, 2011 at UFC 127 Rivera lost to Michael Bisping by way of TKO at 1:54 in the 2nd round. Weeks before he was set to fight Bisping, Rivera made some videos mocking and insulting Bisping and his family. The bout between Rivera and Sakara had been rescheduled again for August 6, 2011 at UFC 133. Before Rivera's fight against Sakara, Rivera mentioned that he may retire from the sport after his next fight due to his age. Rivera instead faced Costas Philippou. He lost the fight via split decision. Rivera faced Eric Schafer on January 20, 2012 at UFC on FX 1. After a dominant first round from Schafer due to takedowns and ground control, Rivera turned the fight around in the second round and won by TKO due to punches. Following the fight, Rivera retired from mixed martial arts competition.  Personal life  Rivera has four children, a son and four daughters, Elijah, Janessa, Marianna, Johanna, and Alanna Rivera. On August 5, 2008, his oldest daughter Janessa Marie died unexpectedly from a reaction to prescription medication.Janessa's obituary  Mixed martial arts record  -  Win  align=center 20‚Äì9  Eric Schafer  TKO (punches)  UFC on FX: Guillard vs. Miller   align=center 2  align=center 1:31  Nashville, Tennessee, United States  -

extremist groups. He also states that he has infiltrated the Tamil Tigers, working for them in London. Jenvey says he used the internet to infiltrate terrorist organizations, and to have developed a relationship with Abu Hamza al-Masri through these means (via Jenvey's Islamic News website, which posed as a genuine extremist site). Recorded film footage with James Ujaama was, he claims, obtained through similar means. Jenvey said that his tapes, in which Hamza called for Jihad, were responsible for Hamza's arrest and trial. Jenvey appeared in the film Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West. Criticism and controversy On 7 January 2009, the UK tabloid newspaper The Sun ran a story saying that participants in a discussion on Ummah.com, a British Muslim internet forum, had made a \\"hate hit list\\" of British Jews to be targeted by extremists over the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The UK magazine Private Eye, later said that Jenvey, posting to the forum under the pseudonym \\"Abuislam\\", had in fact created the only evidence that indicated anything other than a peaceful letter-writing campaign. The story has since been removed from The Suns website following complaints to the UK's Press Complaints Commission. Jenvey himself admitted, in September 2009, on BBC Radio 5 Live's Donal MacIntyre show, to having fabricated and planted the posts on Ummah.com. On 31 December 2009, Jenvey was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred against Jews.

The Port of Honfleur, Port de Honfleur, is the harbour of the Norman town of Honfleur, France. Expeditions to Quebec from this harbour led to its foundation. History The port was founded by Vikings. A port of exploration Jacques Cartier founded Canada in 1534 and gave it to France. He adopts the name Canada which signifies village in Huron. The King of France, Francis 1st, disappointed by the lack of gold or diamonds, decided not to exploit the land. It is only two hundred years later, in the 17th century, that Samuel de Champlain received orders to settle the vast territory. Having left Honfleur, he founded Qu√©bec. The orders of Louis XIV made the first settlements true Norman colonies. More than 4,000 peasants settled and planted the land. Fishing, hunting and the fur trade flourished. The Vieux Bassin The Lieutenancy. The port was remodelled in 1681 by Abraham Duquesne, under orders from Colbert. The former port was a brushed- upon shore in a small haven. Due to the expansion of the port, the Western fortifications of the town were demolished. The port is bordered on three sides, by buildings of two distinct styles; large stone houses on the Southside (Quai Saint-Etienne) and high and narrow wooden houses to the North (Quai Sainte Catherine). The lieutenancy building (la Lieutenance) is at the entrance to the old harbour. It is an old building of the 18th century, and the former home of the Governor of Honfleur. One of the sides of the building is an old gate of the city, the Port de Caen, which was to be part of the city's fortifications. It was between 1684 and 1789 home to the Lieutenant of the king. It became, in 1793, the commerce tribunal. Former glory Corot. At the end of each year, an almanac, called the Annuaire administratif du D√©partement, used to be published, showing statistics relevant to Calvados. Some data of the Port of Honfleur can be found in these books and in 1865, traffic to and from Honfleur was as follows: *Important traffic with England was observed as well as the development of traffic from Norway. Traffic was 384 sailing ships transporting 44,177 tons and 2,011 steam ships transporting 272,169 tons. Ferries to and from Le Havre transported 232,809 passengers. *Goods traffic was composed of eggs, cheeses, butter, poultry, cereals, vegetables, apples and pears and cider to England, horses and farm stock from England. The 1881 annuaire was far more precise, detailing the number of passengers to and from several destinations; 199,789 to and from Le Havre, 2,320 to and from Rouen. It also added 115 to and from Southampton and 91 to Littlehampton, a total of 345,992 passengers that year. Fishing boats were present in numbers, and in 1881, 75 ships were registered and stationed in Honfleur. The sum from the selling of seafood amounted to 391,390 francs. Most of the seafood fished was eaten nearby, but some was exported to Paris and other cities and transported by train by the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest. The catch amounted to 183,491 kb of moules (mussels) and 185,190 kg of fresh fish. Notable imports were wood from Norway, coal from England, wheat from America and lime. The largest ships to have entered the Port of Honfleur were the Anero√Ød, an English, three-mast sailing ship, the Italian three-mast sailing ship, the Nostra-Madre and the English passenger ship, the Newsleydale, with 5.3 m draft.

Its members are part of a select few students from La Salle Green Hills. Aside from being a known singing group and music ministry, Kundirana also has the distinction of being the most renowned high school singing group in the Philippines.The Manila Times Internet Edition  LIFE & TIMES > 35 years of Kundirana music manilatimes.net. Accessed August 31, 2007. Composition The Kundirana is a renowned high school music ministry and organization composed of third and fourth year high school students from La Salle Green Hills. The group is known for developing successful professional singers and artists including Gary Valenciano, Ogie Alcasid, Randy Santiago, Monet Silvestre, Rannie Raymundo, Dingdong Avanzado, Dingdong Eduque, Montet Acoymo, Juan Miguel Salvador, Carlo Orosa, Vince Alaras, Von de Guzman and Gian Magdangal of Philippine Idol, Louie Ocampo, Mel Villena, Mon Faustino, Tats Faustino, Rowell Santiago, Manuel Lahoz, Mikoy Morales, Chito Genito, Manny Pagsuyuin (ex-Campus Radio WLS-FM DJ Jimmy Jam now with Retro 105.9 DCG-FM), Joel Salud, Dennis Buenaventura, Dandy Agustin, and Dennis Barot. The members are carefully picked after rigorous auditions for talented singers. Although the number of students who audition can range from 50 to 70, only about a handful are chosen (depending on the number of graduating members). The final number of selected members for the group usually range from 10 to 16. Once chosen, a Kundirana member undergoes intense training in both singing and dancing eventually becoming ambassadors of goodwill. Former members A lot of former members have either continued on to musical careers or have pursued diverse futures. Nevertheless, these former members have proved themselves successful in their paths, and most of them are leaders in their own fields. A former Kundirana member based in the United States became a doctor and was the one who operated on the US Congresswoman who was shot in the head. Concerts Kundirana has a number of concerts per year, including a farewell concert on June.Commemoration for the graduating members (those who are in 4th year). They also perform in several gatherings some of which have included the opening of the NCAA Season 83 in San Juan Arena where they sang the national anthem, and the Inauguration of Noynoy Aquino where they performed a number with Ogie Alcasid and Regine Velasquez. In August 1987, Kundirana was nationally honored with the Aliw Award as Best Cultural Group in the Philippines. Just recently, the KUNDIRANA celebrated its 40th anniversary with a grand reunion concert at the CCP entitled \\"KUNDIRANA KWARENTA NA! The Men, Music and Mission\\". Charity work Kundirana indulges in its public ministry to serve the needy. The ministry aims to bring joy to the sick, the elderly and the forgotten through music. Among their missionary works, Kundirana can claim to have largely built Bahay Pag-asa, a halfway house in Bacolod, Negros Occidental for juvenile delinquents, who in the past were being jailed with adult criminals who would abuse and corrupt them. Kundirana has also built a lot of classrooms in many parts of the country. Nuestra Se√±ora De Guia The Patron and Holy Image of Kundirana. The Kundirana is not, and has never been, just an ordinary singing group. In these times of confusion and disillusionment, they are the beacon of inspiration and a sterling example of what is the true substance of all performance, and all art: the upliftment of the human spirit. These young men accomplish this task not only through their selfless commitment to the service for others that is fueled by an enlightenment behind-the-scenes moral formation which includes a strict code of conduct, ethics and discipline and the molding of a meaningful prayer life. This task is also accomplish by the group's faith and devotion to Christ and a special relationship with the Blessed Mother. In all of Kundirana's engagements and travels, they are accompanied by the image of the Nuestra Se√±ora De Guia, Our Lady of Guidance, whose home is the Ermita Church. She is the oldest Marian image in the Philippines, is truly the guide of these young men as she leads their way through the difficult paths to people's hearts. Some, hardened. turned to tender devotion, and others, hungry perhaps for our Lady's succor, rekindled in themselves warm compassion for her. She was, and is, an important part of the Kundirana's mission. The Lady is there, always leading the Kundirana's way to touch people's hearts, not only through their music, but more importantly, by the example of their faith. Kundirana 2004: The Instrument Kundirana 2004 saw the very first ever multimedia concert of the singing group. Held in November 2003 at the AFP Theater, the music ministry then shifted its gears for a massive rebrand led by multi-award- winning musical director Von De Guzman with TV personality Tonipet Gaba as the stage director. Their costumes at that time were designed by renowned designer JC buendia consisting of Suits and trench coats as well as swarovski crystal- embellished baseball shirts. For the first and only time in Kundirana history, they were accompanied by a 40-piece orchestra named as the Kundirana Philharmonic Orchestra for their Maiden Concert. The same orchestra also recorded backing tracks for their numerous concerts around the Philippines and abroad. Along with these, a massive multimedia screen was set up front and center to complement each performance during the concert. During their maiden concert, faculty members and female high school students served as guests in some of their performances. Kundirana 2004 was also able to do several TV guestings and mall shows during the year to promote their maiden concert. The batch recorded their album titled The Instrument and sold copies during their concerts to bolster fund-raising efforts. Amidst all the exposure and travel, the group has kept their consistent contributions to several charitable institutions, most notably to the Bahay Pag-asa youth center in Bacolod. Kundirana 2004 bid farewell during their farewell concert staged at the Meralco Theater in June 2004 with Gary Valenciano, a Kundirana alumnus himself, as special guest. In 2008, Kundirana 2004 was invited by LSGH for a reunion concert in celebration of the high school's 50th year celebration called the singkwenta series. It was held at the St. Joseph's Theatre in LSGH with the complete roster of singers performing for the full concert.

They had their Maiden concert October 2011 and in the following month, joined several alumni in participating in the grand reunion concert of the 40th year of The Kundirana Music Ministry held at the CCP representing the current Kundirana batch. They are also the first Kundirana batch directed by Mr. Monet Silvestre who is also a Kundirana alumnus. This batch bears the distinction of having brought back the existence of the Kundirana Band which consists of five musicians. They bring the live-music element to each of their performances which in previous years, was absent. In January 2012, the group had their DLSDasmarinas concert with Mr Gary Valenciano. February 2012, Kundirana 2012 was invited to perform once again in Guam, by Archbishop Anthony Sablan Apuron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Agana. On April 21, 2012, the group held a concert in the city of Davao with Mr. Ogie Alcasid to celebrate a donation to the One La Salle Scholarship Fund by The DLSS - Davao Chapter which was matched by an anonymous donor who witnessed the whole performance by the batch including Mr. Ogie Alcasid.

Description The longnose sawshark has a slender, slightly flattened body with a very long rostrum that can make up to 30% of its total body length. It has pale yellow or grayish-brown dorsal coloring, white ventral coloring, and variegated, sometimes faint dark blotches, spots, and bars on its back. The barbels of the longnose sawshark are halfway down the rostrum, but slightly closer to the rostral tip than the nostrils. Its maximum length is . The longnose sawshark can be confused with one of many species of sawfish, a family of rays, but is distinguished by the five gills located on the sides of its head, as opposed to sawfish which have gills located on the underside of the head. Distribution and habitat The longnose sawshark is found in the eastern Indian Ocean around southern Australia and Tasmania on the continental shelf at depths of 20 - 600m https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF19277. While it may venture into bays and estuaries on occasion, longnose sawsharks prefer sandy and gravelly areas offshore between .Compagno, Leonardo, Dando, Marc and Fowler, Sarah. Sharks of the World. Princeton University Press. 2005. pg 132. Biology and ecology Longnose sawsharks feed primarily on small crustaceans https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0307#.Xschq2gzZPY. Individuals find prey by running their barbels over the ocean floor. They use the teeth on their snouts to stir up sediment and strike prey. Like all sawsharks, reproduction is ovoviviparous. Longnose sawsharks give birth every other winter to between 6 and 19 pups in a litter. After a 12-month gestation period, pups are born in length. Their teeth are folded against the snout at birth, which protects the mother from harm. Longnose sawsharks are highly productive in comparison to other shark species, maturing quickly and only living for around 15 years.http://species- identification.org/species.php?species_group=sharks&id;=225 Human interaction The longnose sawshark is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It used to be listed as Near Threatened, but data gathered after 2000 ultimately led to the new classification. Longnose sawsharks are highly productive and are protected by laws that keep their catch rate stable. Large tracts of their range are protected from all shark fishing, helping to buffer their population loss. Their meat is fairly popular in Australia and is said to have an excellent taste. Because of its deep habitat and overall behavior, the longnose sawshark is not a threat to humans.

History The jazz scene in South Africa grew much as it did in the United States. Through performances in nightclubs, dances, and other venues, musicians had the opportunity to play music often. Musicians such as singer Sathima Bea Benjamin learned by going to nightclubs and jam sessions and waiting for opportunities to offer their talents. One unique aspect of the South African jazz scene was the appearance of individuals imitating popular artists as closely as possible because the real musician wasn't there to perform in the area. For instance, one could find a \\"Cape Town Dizzy Gillespie\\" who would imitate not only the music, but the look and style of Dizzy. This practice created a strong environment to nurture some artists who would eventually leave South Africa and become legitimate contributors to the international jazz scene. One of the first major bebop groups in South Africa in the 1950s was the Jazz Epistles. This group consisted of trombonist Jonas Gwangwa, trumpeter Hugh Masekela, saxophonist Kippie Moeketsi, and pianist Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand). This group brought the sounds of United States bebop, created by artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Thelonious Monk, to Cape Town with Moeketsi modeling his sound and style on Parker's. This group was the first in South Africa to cut a record in the bebop style, but their contemporaries, the Blue Notes, led by pianist Chris McGregor, were no less involved in the local jazz scene. Together, these two groups formed the backbone of South African bebop. An early use of jazz as an anti-apartheid tool was the production of a musical entitled King Kong. Written as a social commentary on young black South Africans, much of the music was arranged and performed by famous South African jazz musicians, including all the members of the Jazz Epistles, minus bandleader Abdullah Ibrahim. The musical was premiered to an integrated audience at the University of Witwatersrand despite efforts of the government to prevent its opening. The university had legal jurisdiction over its property and was able to allow the gathering of an integrated audience. From this point on, as the play toured South Africa, it carried this undertone of defiance with it. The success of the play eventually took it to premiere in London, and while failing financially outside of South Africa, allowed many local jazz musicians an opportunity to obtain passports and leave the country. In March 1960, the first in a series of small uprisings occurred, in an event that is now known as the Sharpeville Massacre. Censorship was dramatically increased by the apartheid government, which led to the shutting down of all venues and events that catered to or employed both black and white individuals. Gatherings of more than ten people were also declared illegal. As a result, a mass exodus was created of jazz musicians leaving South Africa seeking work. Among these were pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, his wife and jazz vocalist Sathima Bea Benjamin, trumpeter Hugh Masekela, and vocalist Miriam Makeba. For some, the move proved to be fortuitous. Ibrahim and Benjamin found themselves in the company of US jazz great Duke Ellington in a night club in Paris in early 1963. The meet resulted in a recording of Ibrahim's trio, Duke Ellington presents the Dollar Brand Trio, and a recording of Benjamin, accompanied by Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Ibrahim, and Svend Asmussen, called A Morning in Paris. Artists such as Masekela traveled to the United States and were exposed first hand to the American jazz scene. One of the most important subgenres of jazz in the region is Cape Jazz. The music originates from Cape Town and surrounding towns and is inspired by the carnival music of the area, sometimes referred to as Goema.

Polmos ≈Åa≈Ñcut controls about ten percent of the Polish market. A small amount of the distillery's output is exported to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and the United States. History The distillery in ≈Åa≈Ñcut was founded by Duchess Lubomirska on the vast estate of the Lubomirski family. An original document attesting to the distillery's existence in 1784 can be found in its museum. Primarily the ≈Åa≈Ñcut estate produced regular, anise flavoured and sweetened vodkas. Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a grandson and heir of the Duchess, started to run the ≈Åa≈Ñcut and Lw√≥w Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties, and implemented the Schwartz distillation equipment. The production of premium vodkas, liqueurs, creams and ratafias was started, in addition to regular and anise flavoured vodkas. The estate ran two company outlets in Lw√≥w and Vienna. In 1882 Alfred J√≥zef Potocki created a network of agents to promote sales in Galicia and Austria‚ÄìHungary. Trains of the Viennese rail lines passing through the town of ≈Åa≈Ñcut used to make longer stops to allow travellers to buy the distilleries' famous products. In 1900, Count Alfred Potocki's Distillery won a gold medal at the International Exposition in Paris for his array of products. Between 1911‚Äì1912 Roman Potocki moved the plant to a newly equipped building. Some of the buildings were destroyed with the eruption of World War I. The difficulties were helped by establishing a stock company in 1917. In 1924 the State alcohol monopoly was funded in Warsaw. ≈Åa≈Ñcut distillery managed to hold its position among the best companies in the country thanks to investments in equipment and innovations. The plant survived the outbreak of World War II largely intact, but it suffered major destruction in 1944 from the withdrawing German armies and advancing Russian units. In 1951 a state enterprise called ≈Åa≈Ñcut Spirits Industries was created out of the ≈Åa≈Ñcut Spirits Stock Company and Count Alfred Potocki's Privileged Distillery of Liqueurs, Rosoglios and Rum in ≈Åa≈Ñcut. In 1969 the plant was producing fifteen kinds of unflavoured and flavoured vodkas, about 200,000 bottles a day. In 1991 Polmos, the Polish Alcohol Monopoly was dissolved. The distillery became an autonomous state company. The previous product line was maintained: about sixty brands, including Wyborowa, Luksusowa, Extra ≈ªytnia, Krakus, Polonaise, Jarzƒôbiak, Soplica, Pieprz√≥wka, ≈ªubr√≥wka, Wi≈õni√≥wka and Ratafia and also Polish Cherry and Cacao Choix liqueurs. Soon more than a dozen of own products was added to the brand assortment. Among others ≈Åa≈Ñcut vodka was introduced and the flag product of the old Potocki firm, Rosoglios, was reintroduced. Museum of Vodka Industry The ≈Åa≈Ñcut distillery holds a museum portraying the plant's traditions and the history of the Polish vodka industry. The museum is located in a manor built in 1883, designed by Ludwik Boguchwalski, which once was the headquarters of the estate management. Its exposition contains old distilling devices, antique machinery as well as old documents, labels, bottles and tasting glasses.

His scenes were like those of the Leagros Group; however, unlike their work, his themes are comic episodes, like modern cartoons. Herakles was a favorite topic, as were banqueting scenes. His banqueters were portrayed satirically: overweight, aging, huge, jutting noses, and so on. The heroic is made anti-heroic by parody. His preferred vase forms are amphorae and hydriae. Name vase He received his name from a representation of a fight between the river god, Acheloos, and Heracles, on formerly Amphora F 1851 in the Berlin Antique collection, now missing. In this comic depiction, the screaming and frightened river god, in the form of a horned centaur, is being kept from escaping by an unflustered Herakles pulling him back by the horns. Hermes, stock messenger of the gods, sits at ease. His long, projecting beard juts out parallel to his long, projecting nose. In the heroic scenes of Greek mythology, a hero ought to be victorious over awful and implacable monsters according to the will of the divine gods. In this scene and others like it the hero demeans himself with a craven and ridiculous monster while the caricature of divinity slumps over in a state of ennui. \\"Nonsense inscriptions\\" have nothing to say. In an unrelated scene on the opposite side, a hoplite and an archer say goodbye to their aged parents. The wrinkles are shown in the mother's neck. The hoplite's shield covers him up to his nose. On it is emblazoned an isolated running leg with a naked buttock. A dog sniffs at the hoplite's groin region.

He created more than twenty works on various European stages and directed the Moscow company of the Bolshoi Theatre. Reisinger choreographed the first stage production of Swan Lake as well as the production of the first ballet performance for the opening of the Prague National Theatre in 1884. His work on Swan Lake was considered unsuccessful by contemporary critics, although the ballet was popular enough among the general public that it was kept in the active repertoire of the Bolshoi Theatre for seven years and was performed over thirty times. In fact, the production was not pulled until the scenery and costumes were worn and threadbare. Much of its popularity was presumably due to its beautiful musical score which was critically acclaimed even though the choreography was not. Reisinger was born in February 1828 in Prague. He began his professional life as a dancer in the corps de ballet, rising to the position of leading soloist. In 1850, he was the partner of the famous dancer Lucille Grahn in La Esmeralda (as Phoebus) and Giselle (as Hilarion). He also danced the part of Diavolino in Jules Perrot's ballet Catarina or La Fille du Bandit. In 1852, Reisinger secured an eight-year engagement on the German and Austrian stages. In 1860 he returned to his native Prague to the Nove Mesto Theatre in the position of choreographer. This was the first time a Czech theatre was headed by a Czech choreographer. Original sketch design for the ballet Swan Lake in 1877 Misconceptions It is commonly thought that none of Reisinger's ballets was successful but facts contradict this. An example of this would be Swan Lake, a classical ballet that is still being performed today. Why then was such a choreographer invited to brilliant Leipzig where he directed the ballet company from 1864 to 1872? Large-scale works were presented there, such as Saltarello and Interrupted Solitude to the music of the Leipzig kapellmeister, Muhldorfer. And from Leipzig, Reisinger was invited to Russia. Indications of Reisinger's Moscow endeavors are readily found in the writings of several Russian historians, the first one being a staging of the five-act ballet The Crystal Slipper (1871, a ballet of the Cinderella story) to Muhldorfer's music, which Yuri Bakhrushin referring to original sources, notes as quite successful. In 1873, finding himself in the post of Director of the Moscow Ballet, he created successive multiple-act productions such as Kastchei, where, as confirmed again by Yuri Bakhrushin, the choreographer successfully developed the Russian theme. He also produced Stella and Ariadne (in tandem with Imperial Balletmaster Marius Petipa). All ballets (except Kastchei, which he staged with the two composers Muhldorfer and Gerber) used the music of Gerber. At the same time, in the last two (Stella and Ariadne), Reisinger reworked elements of ancient art according to the dictates of Biedermeier. Added to that, in the production of Ariadne, the Theatre Directorate allotted what was (for that time), the very large sum of 40,000 roubles. This not only suggests the confidence they had invested in Reisinger, but also confirms that in his first two years in Russia he had clearly won the authority of the Imperial Theatre Directorate. It was with this artistic background that the choreographer approached the first production of Swan Lake. Questions remain Though today Reisinger is considered the father of Czech professional ballet, criticisms regarding his choreography (such as \\"mediocre,\\" \\"ordinary,\\" and \\"untalented\\") have followed him, even after his death. His critics did not endow him with the usual praise in his own country or in Russia, but this did not prevent him from having a very long balletic career. With this in mind, one must ask oneself: was this choreographer truly untalented? Is it possible that in Prague, Moscow, Leipzig and Berlin his ascent to the top was merely the result of a long-patient public and theatre administration? Though good timing undoubtedly played some part in his career, it is possibly unrealistic to form the conclusion that this was the only factor in his solid rise to the forefront of the most respected theatres of the time.

He is best known for his contributions to the study of trace fossils; constructional morphology and structuralism; biostratinomy, Lagerst√§tten and the Ediacaran biota.Briggs, D. E. G. (2005).

Proceedings of a symposium honoring Adolf Seilacher for his contributions to paleontology, in celebration of his 80th birthday, pp. 3‚Äì24 [includes a bibliography of Seilacher up to 2005].Seilacher, A. (2007). Trace Fossil Analysis. Springer, 226 pp. ; .Form and Function: A Tribute to Adolf Seilacher - Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University Career Seilacher worked for his doctorate under Otto Heinrich Schindewolf, at the University of T√ºbingen. He was also influenced by local palaeontologist Otto Linck. He served in World War II and resumed his studies at T√ºbingen, corresponding with the French ichnologist, Jacques Lessertisseur. Gaining his doctorate in 1951 on trace fossils, Seilacher moved to the University of Frankfurt (1957) and then the University of Baghdad before taking up a chair in palaeontology in G√∂ttingen. He returned to T√ºbingen in 1964 as the successor to Schindewolf. After 1987 he held an Adjunct Professorship at Yale University. Significant work Seilacher's publications are numerous (well over 200) and cover a range of topics. His studies on trace fossils are perhaps his best-known contributions, especially his 1967 work on the bathymetry of trace fossils. Here he established the concept of ichnofacies: distinctive assemblages of trace fossils controlled largely by depth. This characterisation was later expanded to include the influences of substrate, oxygen, salinity and so on. In addition, he analysed many trace fossils in terms of the behaviour they represent, leading to such work as early computer simulation of trace fossil morphology (with David Raup, in 1969). Much of this work is summarized together with new material in Trace Fossil Analysis (2007). In 1970 he announced his programme of \\"Konstruktions-Morphologie\\" where he stressed the importance of three factors in determining the form of organisms: ecological/adaptive aspects; historical/phylogenetic aspects; and architectural/constructional aspects. The latter two factors are important sources of biological constraints; both acknowledging that both history and constructional principles place limits on what may be achieved in at least the short term of evolution. Such a view was influential on later workers such as Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, such as their famous paper on \\"spandrels\\" that criticized panadaptionist accounts of evolution and form. Dickinsonia fossil described as a \\"pneu\\" structure with chambers inflated like a quilted air mattress Seilacher's interest in pattern formation led him to espouse self-organisation models for the origin of certain types of form, the most famous of which are pneu structures. These are fluid-filled structures under tension whose form is broadly determined by the need to distribute the tension across the surface. Seilacher may thus be squarely considered to be a structuralist. Seilacher published papers on fossil Lagerst√§tten, including one of 1985 that proposed a widely accepted scheme for their classification; indeed, much of his work has been concerned with preservation and taphonomy in general. His most controversial contributions were in his work on the Ediacaran assemblages, which he and Friedrich Pfl√ºger (1994) suggested, based on their constructional morphology, to be pneu structures unrelated to modern metazoans. While this view has been steadily opposed by many workers, it gained some ground as the affinities of many of these organisms have remained resistant to analysis. Seilacher considered many of these taxa to be giant xenophyophores, i.e. large rhizopodal protists. He appeared in the film Volcanoes of the Deep Sea, going on a dive on the DSV Alvin to investigate modern analogues of the trace fossil Paleodictyon. Awards * 1983 Raymond C.

Presence of 6 pairs of gill slits highlights this genus among sharks; outside Hexanchiformes order, Pliotrema is the only shark with more than 5 gill slits. Unlike other sawsharks, the barbs on this shark's rostrum continue onto the sides of the head. Its barbels are also closer to its mouth than in other species. At maximum, females can reach over 136 cm long, and males can reach over 112 cm long. Range and habitat The sixgill sawshark is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of the western Indian Ocean between latitudes 23¬∞ S and 37¬∞ S, at depths of between 37 and 500 m. This shark lives in the benthic and benthopelagic zones of the continental shelf. Adults are partially segregated from juveniles, as they naturally tend to aggregate at lower depths.http://species- identification.org/species.php?species_group=sharks&id;=224 Behavior Using their sensitive barbels and electric sense, sixgill sawsharks are able to find their prey and then incapacitate them with their rostrum. Their known diet includes small fish, crustaceans, and squids. The only observed predator of the sixgill sawshark is the tiger shark, though it is likely other large sharks predate this species. These sharks, like other sawsharks, are ovoviviparous. They are thought to breed annually, giving birth to around five to seven pups per litter. It is possible that they come to inshore pupping grounds to give birth. The pups are around 35 cm at birth, and they later mature at around 83 cm if they are male, and around 110 cm if they are female.Compagno, Leonardo, Dando, Marc and Fowler, Sarah. Sharks of the World. Princeton University Press. 2005. pg 131-132. Conservation The sixgill sawshark is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. This is because of their restricted geographical range, small litters, high age of maturity, and extreme vulnerability to bottom trawling fishing. Though they are not sought after in any market, they are frequently caught as by-catch and disposed. Because of their deep habitat, sixgill sawsharks are not considered a threat to people.

In it, Socrates attempts to persuade Alcibiades that it is unsafe for him to pray to the gods if he does not know whether what he prays for is actually good or bad for him. There is dispute amongst scholars about the text's authenticity, and it is generally considered apocryphal.Plato, Complete Works, ed. John M. Cooper (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1997), v, 596-608. The main criticisms of its authenticity revolve around its defective arguments, lack of humor, and style; those who consider it inauthentic date its composition to the 3rd or 2nd centuries BC.W. R. M. Lamb, Introduction to Alcibiades II, in Plato, vol. 12, Charmides Alcibiades Hipparchus The Lovers Theages Minos Epinomis, ed. Lamb, L201 in the Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927), 226. Synopsis Socrates meets Alcibiades while the latter was on his way to pray, and warns him that one must be careful what he prays for, since the gods might actually grant his wishes. Alcibiades replies that one must be mad to pray for something harmful, but Socrates corrects him by saying that if ignorance was equated to madness, and considering the ignorant are so many, they would be in grave danger with all these lunatics running around (139d). Rather, madness and ignorance are subsets of a larger thing, which is the opposite of wisdom. Like various ailments are all opposites of health without being identical, so the opposites of wisdom are many, madness and ignorance among them, but also a form of \\"romanticism\\", megal√≥ps≈´khos in the original text (140c).Plato. Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vol. 8 translated by W.R.M. Lamb. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1955. Alcibiades stands corrected, and Socrates continues with the main question of whether he, Alcibiades, would ever wish something harmful. As an example, Socrates affirms that he is certain, that had the god granted Alcibiades the rule of Greece, he would have accepted. With his question Socrates could also be playing on Alcibiades' ambitious nature, that was known throughout Greece and was immortalised in Thucydide's history.Frankel, Benjamin \\"Roots of Realism Routledge\\" Oct 11, 2013. p.183 Alcibiades naturally agrees and Socrates reminds him of how named rulers like Archelaus of Macedon had been murdered or expelled from their cities. So what seems better, Socrates says, is what a certain poem said some time ago: \\"King Zeus, give unto us what is good, whether we pray or pray not; But what is grievous, even if we pray for it, do thou avert\\" (143a). Alcibiades grants Socrates that what he had just said was indeed the best practice when it comes to prayers, but surprisingly, Socrates continues by saying that they shouldn't dismiss ignorance so quickly, and cites by way of example, the ignorance of bad things. If one for example was to commit a murder but could't remember the face of their future victim, then this type of ignorance can actually be considered good, so that, for those predisposed towards evil, ignorance is preferable than knowledge. If knowledge is partial, and is not a part of wisdom, which includes where and how this knowledge is to be practiced, then it can be dangerous. The orators then who go around Athens encouraging its citizens towards or against war, and to the degree they cannot describe the precise length or ideal location of this war, are acting as fools despite being knowledgeable in war's theories. For all these reasons Socrates concludes, it is wiser to copy the Spartans who, according to this dialogue, pray simply and in private (149a) while remaining victorious in battle and postpone the sacrifice that Alcibiades was planning until his head is clearer and he can distinguish more readily between good and evil (150e). Alcibiades agrees and thanks Socrates, offering his garland crown to him. Socrates accepts and recalls of a similar in one of Euripides plays, where the seer Tiresias is likewise crowned for his wisdom, while the \\"wave-tossed\\" (·ºêŒΩ Œ∫ŒªœçŒ¥œâŒΩŒπ Œ∫ŒµŒØŒºŒµŒ∏') king considers it a good omen. In similar fashion, Socrates, famously in love with young Alcibiades, and feeling likewise \\"wave-tossed\\" wants to consider this \\"coronation\\" a good omen and \\"would like to come off victorious over your lovers\\" (151c).

Despite being declared to be a news-based channel, the majority of the channel's programming since the early 2010s, consists of telemarketing. History In 1992, the channel was launched as Tile Tora, founded by journalist Gregoris Michalopoulos. In January 2000, the channel was bought by Stathis Tsotsoros (Alpha TV) and was renamed POLIS TV or POLIS for short; a radio counterpart was established the same year. Michalopoulos became the channel's vice president. In 2004, the channel was renamed TV Cosmopolis or TVC for short. In 2005, the channel changed ownership again, and was temporarily renamed back to POLIS in preparation for an overhaul. In October 11, 2005, a fire almost completely ruined formerly sister station Alpha TV's studios in Agios Ioannis Rentis, where the regional station was housed anew, along with some archive material; the scheduled for the end of the month rebrand and new programming of the station were halted, with its already existing programming broadcasting from Alpha's headquarters in Kantza. On December 2005, the station was renamed to Channel 9, broadcasting from the studios in Rentis, after another deadline for December 5 was expired. The then new programming of the station, featuring primarily news bulletins, was undertaken by journalist Nikos Evangelatos, who was at the same time hosting the news program Apodeikseis on Alpha. It hasn't changed its main 4:3 idents since then. In 2010, the channel started focusing on economy shows, with Panagiotis Mpousmpourelisa at the head. Between 2004 and 2006, the channel was infamous for strikes by its crew and its executives firing employees. The channel would slowly start constantly airing replays of other shows, and there would be a potential shutdown of the station. At the end of 2006, journalist Nikos Evangelatos was forced to resing, following improper financial handling, firing all of the station's 390 employees. Since then, Channel 9 has gone through economic redevelopment, something that has managed to progress slowly into the new digital age. In February 2007, Channel 9 started broadcasting live from its website. In December 2013, Channel 9 was added to Cosmote TV.ŒùŒ≠Œ± œÄŒµœÅŒπœÜŒµœÅŒµŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ Œ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¨ŒªŒπŒ± œÉœÑŒøŒΩ OTE TV It was removed from the service in November 2018. Ownership Until mid-2006, journalist Nikos Evangelatos held a significant share in the station. Behind the journalist was businessman Dimitris Kontominas, and only because Greek law at the time did not allow individual ownership of more than one television channel and two radio stations. The law has since changed and Dimitris Kontominas is the majority shareholder. The channel has several times changed ownership in its history. The first company to operate the station was the Tiletora Anonymous Radio Television Company, which was established on February 6, 1992. A year later, the operation of the channel under the 19205/E license of local signal in Attica was legalized, and on March 20, 1998, the Ministry for the Press issued a decision, according to which, the channel was re-legalized as a regional one. Since its inception, the channel's headquarters would be initially located at Lycabettus St. 17 and later on Ilias Iliou St. 15, until mid-2001, when it was moved to Kallithea. On June 30, 2000, the organization's statute was altered, by adding the purpose of producing films for the needs of the channel, and a few months later, due to a change of ownership, the name of the organization was changed to Polis Anonymous Television Company. Journalist Petros Diplas became its president. In mid-2004, the station was sold and the name of the previous operator of the station changed to Mediterranean Television Enterprises SA, which shut down one year later. On May 25, 2004, Radio Television Operations Cosmopolis TVC SA was established, as a conversion of the same-named joint venture and which took over again the television channel, purchased from Polis SA. By mid-2005, the major shareholder would appear to be Stathis Tsotsoros, president of the directors' board and chief executive on Alpha TV and Channel 9.ŒüŒúŒôŒõŒôŒë ŒùŒëŒùŒëŒ£ ŒùŒ§ŒëŒüŒ•ŒùŒ§ŒëŒöŒó Œ†Œ°ŒüŒïŒîŒ°ŒïŒüŒ•Œ£ŒëŒ£ Œ§ŒüŒ• Œî.Œ£.

At the same time, it started to maintain a branch office at Kontoi St. 11-13, also in Renti, where the former production offices of its sister channel, Alpha TV, were housed. In late 2010, the organization's statute was altered, with an expansion of activities, while two years later, the station's headquarters were transferred to the old facilities of Alpha TV in Paiania. Programming TV Cosmopolis logo. Channel 9‚Äôs programming originally was based on newscasts, original productions and cartoons. The channel had nine daily newscasts to match its name.

Other programming would include children‚Äôs series, foreign films from Village Roadshow and original productions, mainly medical ones. Until 2007 the majority of the channel's programming consisted of cartoons from Nickelodeon. Channel 9 has also aired sports events such as Bundesliga, Eredivisie, the Scotland Premier League, NBA, Serie A,Campionato: œÉœÖŒΩŒ±œÅœÄŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÄŒøŒ¥œåœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒø œÉœÑŒø Channel 9 Coupe de France¬´To ŒìŒ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫œå ŒöœçœÄŒµŒªŒªŒø œÉœÑŒø Channel 9¬ª and Skoda Foot Volley 2006, as well as programming from MTV Europe and productions for its sister channel, Alpha TV, since its change of ownership in 2000 (such as TSA, I Kouzina tis Mamas and Oikogeneiakes Istories). Currently, almost all of its programming in the daytime consists of telemarketing. Various local stations in Greece, including Star Central Greece in Lamia, NET TV in western Peloponnesus, the ORT in Peloponnesus, Kriti TV in Crete, Super B in western Greece, Delta TV in Thraki, Center TV in south Macedonia, Cosmos TV (a subsidiary channel of Channel 9 in Thessaloniki, nowadays called Kanali 9) and Dion TV in central Macedonia, In-Channel in Epirus, New TV in eastern Macedonia, Flash TV in western Macedonia and TV 10 in Thessaly, have aired a significant part of programming from Channel 9, as part of a project formerly known as POLIS Net. Polis Net Consultants, the company behind the project, was established on September 28, 2000. Stathis Tsotsoros, Vasilis Vasilogamvros and Petros Diplas have been its presidents in the past. *Afilakti Diavasi ‚Äì presented by Gregoris Michalopoulos.

(2019-) Nickelodeon Channel 9 started airing Nickelodeon cartoons (in a block also known as Nick Toons; a first for free-to-air television in Greece), formerly known as the staples of the channel's programming, in late 2003, around one year after Alpha Digital, a digital satellite pay television platform by sister channel Alpha TV, was discontinued due to low amount of subscribers and financial problems. Alpha Kids was one of its premium channels, and would air throughout the enirety of its everyday schedule Nickelodeon shows (formerly aired on a block on Alpha Cinema 1). No new Nickelodeon shows were bought after its closure. Initially, Nickelodeon bumpers from the 90's would air in-between commercial breaks, similarly to other counterparts of Nickelodeon, such as Nickelodeon Russia. In 2005, after the channel was rebranded to Channel 9, the idents in the block were changed to the ones used in the United States counterpart at that time, till early 2008, when the block was discontinued. Ants, Ants, Ants, a short about ants playing hula hoops in the ant hill, and Zoom, a short animated by the illustrator of the wordless book it's based on, Istvan Banyai, would also air during commercial breaks. *SpongeBob SquarePants (seasons 1-3) *Dora the Explorer *Rugrats (Œ°Œ¨Œ≥Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑœÇ) *CatDog *Eureeka's Castle (Œ§Œø ŒöŒ¨œÉœÑœÅŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒìŒπŒøœÖœÅŒØŒ∫Œ±) *Blue's Clues (Œ§Œ± Œ£œÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒúœÄŒªŒøœç) *Legends of the Hidden Temple (Œ§Œ± ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœÅœÖŒºŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ ŒùŒ±Œøœç) *Aaahh!!!

In the video, he makes fun of the supposedly realistic acting and the script.

Etymology The word is composed from dorter and the Middle English prefix rere-, coming from Anglo-French rere \\"backward, behind,\\" from Latin retro; it was coined in the 19th century. The mediaeval term was necessarium (place of necessity).Greene, p. 119. Siting and features It was normally attached to the south end or the east side of the monks' dormitory or \\"dorter\\" on the east of the main cloister, that is, the end away from the church,Geoffrey N. Wright, Discovering Abbeys and Priories, 4th ed. Princes Risborough: Shire, 2004, , p. 27. with seats arranged on the first floor of the building allowing direct access from the dormitory. Waste fell down chutes or between walls (as far as )J. Patrick Greene, Medieval Monasteries, Archaeology of medieval Britain, Leicester/New York: Leicester University, 1992, , repr. Continuum Studies in Medieval Historia, London: Continuum, 2005, , p. 121. and was usually carried away by a stream, river or conduit; availability of a suitable stream was often a factor in siting a monastery,Greene, p. 8. and some monasteries have unusual ground plans to enable facilities such as the reredorter to have access to the water. Sophisticated water engineering was used at C√Æteaux Abbey, Roche Abbey and the Carmelite Desierto de Los Leones in Mexico to ensure both that these rooms remained fresh and that the effluent did not pollute water needed for cooking and washing. There appear to have been as many seats as there were monks, separated by screens, and each with a window. In some monasteries there were two reredorters, one for the monks and one for the lay brothers. The lay brothers‚Äô reredorter was most often to the west of the cloister, attached to their dormitory in a similar way to that of the monks. An example was at Valle Crucis Abbey in Clwyd.Greene, p. 121.

Aison was an ancient Greek vase painter of the red-figure style. About 60 of his vases survive, which are dated between 435 and 415 BCE. Aison spent his career in several workshops, where he came into contact with several other well-known painters. His first works were created in the same workshop as the Kodros Painter. A kylix with motifs from the Theseus legend, that is today in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, was created in the same workshop that Penthesilea Painter was active in and Aristophanes was later to join. In his third workshop he worked together with the Schuvalow painter and the Eretria painter. Here he painted mostly closed containers. All three artists stood in the tradition of Polygnotos. From this time his second showpiece originates, the lekythos in Naples National Archaeological Museum. Two further lekythos (from the Louvre and the National Archaeological Museum of Athens) clearly mark a turning point in the artist's life when he embraced the Adonis cult. The difference is seen in the quality of his work, which is probably due primarily to difficult life circumstances, as demonstrated by the frequent workshop changes. References *John Boardman.

It crosses El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras. The Sierra Madre de Chiapas is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western \\"backbone\\" of North America, Central America, and South America. Geography The range runs northwest‚Äìsoutheast from the state of Chiapas in Mexico, across western Guatemala, into El Salvador and Honduras. Most of the volcanoes of Guatemala, part of the Central America Volcanic Arc, are within the range. A narrow coastal plain lies south of the range, between the Sierra Madre and the Pacific Ocean. To the north lie a series of highlands and depressions, including the Chiapas Depression, which separates the Sierra Madre from the Chiapas Plateau, the Guatemalan Highlands, and Honduras' interior highlands. The range forms the main drainage divide between the Pacific and Atlantic river systems. On the Pacific side the distance to the sea is short, and the streams, while very numerous, are consequently small and rapid. A few of the streams of the Pacific slopes rise in the Guatemalan Highlands, and force a way through the Sierra Madre at the bottom of deep ravines. On the eastern side a number of the rivers of the Atlantic slopes attain a considerable volume and size. The Sierra Madre de Chiapas moist forests ecoregion covers the southern slopes of the mountains. The mountains intercept winds from the Pacific, creating fog, clouds, and orographic precipitation that sustain the ecoregion's cloud forests. The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion covers the Sierra's high peaks and northern slopes. Regional names It is known near Guatemala city as the Sierra de las Nubes, and enters Mexico as the Sierra de Istatan. Its summit is not a well- defined crest, but is often rounded or flattened into a table-land. The direction of the great volcanic cones, which rise in an irregular line above it, is not identical with the main axis of the Sierra itself, except near the Mexican frontier, but has a more southerly trend, especially towards El Salvador. Volcanoes The base of many of the volcanic igneous peaks rests among the southern foothills in the southern region of the range. It is, however, impossible to subdivide the Sierra Madre into a northern and a volcanic chain; for the volcanoes are isolated by stretches of comparatively low country; at least thirteen considerable streams flow down between them, from the main watershed to the sea. Viewed from the coast, the volcanic cones seem to rise directly from the central heights of the Sierra Madre, above which they tower; but in reality their bases are, as a rule, farther south. East of Volc√°n Tacana (4,092 metres) which marks the Mexican frontier, the principal volcanoes are Tajumulco (4,220 meters); Santa Maria (3,777 meters), which was in eruption during 1902, after centuries of quiescence, in which its slopes had been overgrown by dense forests; Atitlan (3,557 meters), overlooking Lake Atitlan; Acatenango (3,976 meters); Fuego (i.e. \\"fire,\\" 3,763 metres), which received its name from its activity at the time of the Spanish conquest; Agua (i.e. \\"water,\\" 3,765 meters), so named in 1541 because it destroyed the former capital of Guatemala with a deluge of water from its flooded crater; and Pacaya (2,550 metres), a group of igneous peaks which were in eruption in 1870. East of the Guatemalan border, the range forms the boundary between El Salvador and Honduras. In El Salvador, the volcanoes form a line well south of the range, where over twenty volcanoes form five clusters. Between the Sierra Madre and the Volcanic line lies a central plateau.

He died of a blow to the head at the hands of the pilot and a passenger of a plane of which he had seized control. Early life Koenecke was the son of a locomotive engineer and had worked as a fireman for the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. Minor league career Koenecke made his professional debut for the Moline Plowboys in the Mississippi Valley League in 1927. In 1928 he joined Indianapolis in the American Association. Major League career After several seasons with Indianapolis, Koenecke was signed to the New York Giants in December 1931 in a deal worth $75,000. Manager John McGraw predicted he would \\"be a bright star in the National League\\". He played just the one season with the Giants. Koenecke made his debut for the Giants, going hitless against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 12, 1932https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/koenele01.shtml In 1933, playing for the International League Buffalo Bisons, he hit .334 and drove in 100 runs batted in with eight home runs. In 1934, Koenecke joined the Brooklyn Dodgers, where in his first season he hit 14 home runs, 73 RBIs and set a National League fielding record with a percentage of .994. His second season saw a decline in his onfield performance and his drinking became a problem to the point where he was cut on September 16, 1935, during the middle of a road trip after a game in Chicago. Just one day later, he would be dead.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/koenele01.shtml Death After being sent home from the road trip, Koenecke caught a commercial flight for New York City. During the flight, he drank a quart of whiskey and became very drunk. After Koenecke had harassed other passengers and struck a stewardess, the pilot had to sit on him to restrain him as he was shackled to his seat. He was removed unconscious from the flight in Detroit. After sleeping on a chair in the airport, he chartered a flight to Toronto in the hopes of rejoining the Bisons. While flying over Canada, he had a disagreement with the pilot and a passenger, and attempted to take control of the aircraft. In order to avoid a crash, Koenecke was hit over the head with a fire extinguisher by both the pilot, who had left his controls, and the other passenger. After an emergency landing at Long Branch Racetrack in Toronto, it was found that Koenecke had died of a cerebral hemorrhage. The two men were charged with manslaughter but were found not liable by a coroner's jury soon after. He was buried in Mount Repose Cemetery at Friendship, Wisconsin.

It is directly south of the town of Stroud, north of the town of Nailsworth and north-west of the village of Minchinhampton. The parish includes the settlements of Bagpath (not to be confused with Bagpath in the Ozleworth valley), Butterrow, Kingscourt, Lightpill and Rooksmoor, and is adjacent to the Stroud suburb of Dudbridge. The population taken at the 2011 census was 5,334. An entrance to Rodborough Fort Built on a hill, Rodborough village is near Rodborough Common, a public recreation area popular with walkers. Most of the common land was donated to the National Trust in 1937 by Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher (1878‚Äì1950), an entomologist. It is little known that this was dependent on a subscription fund of ¬£700 being raised to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of the common. On the common is Rodborough Fort, a folly built in 1761 that is now a private house.  Amenities  Rodborough Common is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.Natural England SSSI information on the citation, map and units of assessment The parish has two primary schools, several public houses, a large hotel called The Bear of Rodborough Hotel and a community hall. It is home to the historic Winstones Ice Cream Factory. It has a large and active Christian community who attend the Church of England parish church of St. Mary Magdalene or Rodborough Tabernacle United Reformed Church, and its various clubs and societies include a football club, a Scout group and a mother and toddler network. The local newspaper is the Stroud News & Journal and the parish council also produces a quarterly newsletter called The Commoner. For children there are several playgrounds in Rodborough and the community hall hosts a youth club every Friday night. Governance Rodborough is served by Rodborough Parish Council, Stroud District Council and Gloucestershire County Council. Until 1974 much of the parish was part of the Stroud Urban District Council and today it forms part of the Stroud urban area, along with Stroud and Cainscross. An electoral ward in the same name exists. All of this ward is within the civil parish and a reduced population therefore applies: at the 2011 Census it was 4,543. Notable people The Gothic Revival architect Benjamin Bucknall was born in Rodborough in 1833. He designed the uncompleted Woodchester Mansion and a number of houses and Roman Catholic churches and convents, particularly in Gloucestershire and South Wales. In later life he worked in Algiers. The Reverend Wilbert Awdry, who wrote The Railway Series of children's books that inspired the TV series Thomas & Friends, moved to 30 Rodborough Avenue in 1965 and lived there until his death on 21 March 1997.

How sex in space could work and the challenges in zero gravity Sex in space, specifically human sexual activity in the weightlessness of outer space, presents difficulties due to Newton's third law. According to the law, if the couple remain attached, their movements will counter each other. Consequently, their actions will not change their velocity unless they are affected by another, unattached, object. Some difficulty could occur due to drifting into other objects. If the couple have a combined velocity relative to other objects, collisions could occur. There have been suggestions that conception and pregnancy in off-Earth environments could be an issue.Seks in de ruimte: is het mogelijk?, By Caroline Hoek; 7 April 2012S‚Äôenvoyer en l‚Äôair dans l‚Äôespace Par Kieron Monks, Metro World News; 11 Avril 2012 , with NASA planning long-term missions for lunar settlements with goals to explore and colonize space, the topic has taken a respected place in life sciences. Scientist Stephen Hawking publicly concluded in 2006 that possibly human survival itself will depend on successfully contending with the extreme environments of space. Physiological issues Numerous physiological changes have been noted during spaceflight, many of which may affect sex and procreation. Such effects would be a result of factors including gravity changes, radiation, noise, vibration, isolation, disrupted circadian rhythms, stress, or a combination of these factors. Gravity and microgravity The primary issue to be considered in off-Earth reproduction is the lack of gravitational acceleration. Life on Earth, and thus the reproductive and ontogenetic processes of all extant species and their ancestors, evolved under the constant influence of the Earth's 1g gravitational field. It is imperative to study how space environment affects critical phases of mammalian reproduction and development as well as events surrounding fertilization, embryogenesis, pregnancy, birth, postnatal maturation, and parental care. Gravity affects all aspects of vertebrate development, including cell structure and function, organ system development, and even behavior. As gravity regulates mammalian gene expression, there are significant implications for successful procreation in an extraterrestrial environment. Studies conducted on reproduction of mammals in microgravity include experiments with rats. Although the fetus developed properly once exposed to normal gravity, the rats that were raised in microgravity lacked the ability to right themselves. Another study examined mouse embryo fertilization in microgravity. Although both groups resulted in healthy mice once implanted at normal gravity, the authors noted that the fertilization rate was lower for the embryos fertilized in microgravity than for those in normal gravity. Currently no mice or rats have developed while in microgravity throughout the entire developmental cycle. 2Suit The 2suit (alternately 2-Suit or twosuit) is a garment designed to facilitate low-effort sex in the weightless environments such as outer space, or on planets with low gravity. The flight garment, invented by American novelist Vanna Bonta, was one of the subjects of Sex in Space, a 2008 History Channel television documentary about the biological and emotional implications of human migration and reproduction beyond Earth.History Channel to air special on 'sex in space' New Scientist December 17, 2008 The 2suit sparked international discussions in news and political debates as a metaphor for human colonization of space. Planned attempts In February 2013, Dennis Tito's Inspiration Mars Foundation announced that they were going to send a two-person crew ‚Äì a man and a woman ‚Äì on a 501-day, free-return, flyby mission to Mars and back. Jane Poynter stressed the importance of the pre-existing stable emotional bond between the members of the couple. She cited her own experience as being a Biosphere 2 crew member together with her husband Taber MacCallum, who is the chief technology officer of Inspiration Mars. In June 2015, Pornhub announced its plans to make the first pornographic film in space. It launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund the effort, dubbed Sexploration, with the goal of raising $3.4 million in 60 days. The campaign only received pledges for $236,086. If funded, the film would have been slated for a 2016 release, following six months of training for the two performers and six-person crew. Though it claimed to be in talks with multiple private spaceflight carriers, the company declined to name names \\"for fear that that would risk unnecessary fallout\\" from the carriers. A Space.com article about the campaign mentioned that in 2008, Virgin Galactic received and rejected a $1 million offer from an undisclosed party to shoot a sex film on board SpaceShipTwo. Adult film actress CoCo Brown had begun certifying for a co-pilot seat in the XCOR Lynx spaceplane, which would have launched in a suborbital flight in 2016 and spent a short amount of time in zero-gravity. However, XCOR declared bankruptcy before ever flying a space tourist. Short of actual space, the adult entertainment production company Private Media Group has filmed a movie called The Uranus Experiment: Part Two where an actual zero-gravity intercourse scene was accomplished with a reduced-gravity aircraft. The filming process was particularly difficult from a technical and logistical standpoint. Budget constraints allowed for only one shot, featuring the actors Sylvia Saint and Nick Lang. Berth Milton, Jr, president and CEO of Private Media Group, says \\"You would not want to be afraid of flying, that's for sure!\\" In popular culture Science fiction writer and futurist Isaac Asimov, in a 1973 article \\"Sex in a Spaceship\\", conjectured what sex would be like in the weightless environment of space, anticipating some of the benefits of engaging in sex in an environment of microgravity. (Reprinted in Science Past ‚Äì Science Future, 1975) On July 23, 2006, a Sex in Space panel was held at the Space Frontier Foundation's annual conference. Speakers were science journalist-author Laura Woodmansee, who presented her book Sex in Space; Jim Logan, the first graduate of a new aerospace medicine residency program to be hired by NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston; and Vanna Bonta, an American poet, novelist, and actress who had recently flown in zero gravity and had agreed to an interview for Woodmansee's book. The speakers made presentations that explored \\"the biological, emotional, and ... physical issues that will confront people moving [off Earth] into the space environment.\\" NBC science journalist Alan Boyle reported on the panel, opening a world discussion of a topic previously considered taboo. \\"Sex in Space\\" was the title of an episode of the History Channel documentary television series The Universe in 2008. The globally distributed show was dubbed into foreign languages, opening worldwide discussion about what had previously been avoided as a taboo subject. Sex in space became a topic of discussion for the long-term survival of the human species, colonization of other planets, inspired songs, and humanized reasons for space exploration.La fantas√≠a del sexo en gravedad cero PERU21; 29 August 2012From Quarks to Quasars The Complications of Sex in Space October 9, 2013Outside Magazine December 2006 issue7 Real Suits That Will Soon Make the World A Cooler Place by Soren Bowie, Cracked; 15 November 2010Tener beb√©s en el espacio podr√≠a ser peligroso FayerWayer, (Science Feature) Boxbyte en Ciencia, Destacados; October 2010Wakacje w Kosmosie?

Clarke claimed to first address it in his novel Rendezvous with Rama (1973). Among films that include space-sex themes are Moonraker, Moving Violations, Supernova and Cube 2: Hypercube. In the novelization of Alien, Parker tells Brett about an episode of zero-G sex that went wrong. A more recent and perhaps more realistic description of the mechanics of low-gravity intercourse is presented in \\"Sex in Space: The Video\\", a short story contained in Susie Bright's The Best American Erotica 2004. The story uses cheating astronauts to describe techniques humans might use to copulate in space without special apparatus. The difficulties microgravity poses for human intimacy were also discussed in an anonymous fictional \\"NASA Document 12-571-3570\\" in 1989, where the use of an elastic belt and an inflatable tunnel were proposed as solutions to these problems. A mission patch and other documents were determined to be hoaxes.

Biography   With Cock Robin  She co-founded the band with Peter Kingsbery in the early '80s in Los Angeles, and remained with the group through three albums and tours with, among others, Bryan Adams, the Bangles and James Taylor. Although they experienced only limited success in the U.S., Cock Robin gained substantial acclaim in Europe. However, failing to sustain momentum, the group dissolved in 1990. In 2006 she took part in the reforming of Cock Robin and sang on their fourth studio album, followed by a live album and a new tour in 2009.  Solo career  During the 90s, LaCazio sang occasional backup for artists from Corey Hart to Purple Mountain Matinee. In 1992 she recorded a solo album, Eat Life, that was not released before 2009. She also appeared on Kingsbery's 1997 release Pretty Ballerina, with a re-recording of the Cock Robin track, \\"More Than Willing\\". She moved from Los Angeles to the California desert, where she also has been performing as part of Ra Sol. In 2008, she contributed a reading of her poem \\"A Song for Lost Blossoms\\" to the album of the same name by Harold Budd and former Cock Robin member Clive Wright.

Common examples include: * Tracking of moving objects, which typically can occupy only a single position at a given time. * A database of wireless communication networks, which may exist only for a short timespan within a geographic region. * An index of species in a given geographic region, where over time additional species may be introduced or existing species migrate or die out. * Historical tracking of plate tectonic activity. Spatiotemporal databases are an extension of spatial databases and temporal databases. A spatiotemporal database embodies spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal database concepts, and captures spatial and temporal aspects of data and deals with: * geometry changing over time and/or * location of objects moving over invariant geometry (known variously as moving objects databases or real-time locating systems). Implementations Although there exist numerous relational databases with spatial extensions, spatiotemporal databases are not based on the relational model for practical reasons, chiefly among them that the data is multi-dimensional, capturing complex structures and behaviours. As of 2008, there are no RDBMS products with spatiotemporal extensions. There are some products such as the open-source TerraLib which use a middleware approach storing their data in a relational database. Unlike in the pure spatial domain, there are however no official or de facto standards for spatio-temporal data models and their querying. In general, the theory of this area is also less well-developed. Another approach is the constraint database system such as MLPQ (Management of Linear Programming Queries).http://www.cse.unl.edu/~revesz/MLPQ/mlpq.htm GeoMesa is an open- source distributed spatiotemporal index built on top of Bigtable-style databases using an implementation of the Z-order_curve to create a multi- dimensional index combining space and time.

The community is situated on the Eastern Shore at the mouth of the Musquodoboit River. The community lies 45 kilometres east of downtown Halifax. With a hospital, RCMP detachment, postal outlet, schools, recreational center, library, municipal office and other services, Musquodoboit Harbour is a serve centre for many of the surrounding communities. Musquodoboit means foaming to the sea, flowing out square or rolling out in foam, or suddenly widening out after a narrow entrance at its mouth. The community is an anglicized version of the Mi‚Äôkmaq word Moosekudoboogwek or Muskoodeboogwek.  History  The local railway station is now a museumThe community was settled in the 1780s mainly by Loyalists. Through the late 18th and early 19th centuries many settlers from Scotland, England and Germany immigrated to the area and they still have descendants in the area, evidenced by prominent family names such as Tibbo, Rowlings, Anderson, Gaetz, and Bayers. Transportation history Much early travel was by water as roads were rough. Beginning in 1852, the stage coach travelled from Musquodoboit Harbour to Dartmouth at a cost of 5 shillings. The first automobile was owned by Dr. Kennedy in 1909. The Dartmouth Eastern Railway commenced in 1912 to carry lumber and lime from Middle Musquodoboit to Dartmouth. A station was completed in 1918 and today houses the Musquodoboit Harbour Railway Museum, which also serves as the local tourism office in summer. The museum grounds contain a passenger car, snow plow from the Dominion Atlantic Railway and a caboose from the Canadian National Railway. The museum is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage- display.aspx?id=5334 Canadian Register of Historic Places. Other services The Rural Telephone system came into use around 1909. The Fire Department It all began one evening in 1957 when Garth Young was sitting at the table playing crib with friends. His sister ran in and said she could see flames in a window upstairs as she was driving down the road. Garth and his father each grabbed a bucket of water and ran upstairs, but there was nothing they could do. There was no fire department in Musquodoboit Harbour. They called Lands and Forests (now called the Department of Natural Resources) who showed up later with a portable pump and some hose. But by now, the two story house was in flames and the dozen family members who lived there could only watch helplessly as it burned to the ground. The loss motivated Garth Young and other people in the community to establish their own fire department. By 1960 Garth Young was clearing land for the new station. A year later the Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department was born and he became one of its original members. The Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department formed in 1961 with the fire hall opening on October 6, 1964. The first piece of equipment they had was a trailer with a pump on it. It had compartments on each side into which they were able to put extra equipment, such as hoses. The first truck they had was a 1957 milk truck that they bought in 1963 from a farmer. The Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary formed in February 1967. In 1996, Halifax, Dartmouth, Bedford, and the County of Halifax amalgamated into what is today the Halifax Regional Municipality. Dozens of fire departments merged into the Halifax Regional Fire & Emergency Services, and the Musquodoboit Harbour Volunteer Fire Department received the designation of \\"Halifax Regional Fire & Emergency, Station 24.\\" On June 13, 2008, The station was actively involved in the Porter's Lake fire, one of the biggest forest fire in Nova Scotia's history. Members spent 5 days working side-by-side with the Department of Natural Resources. On October 6, 2008, the station was manned with career staff for the very first time. From October 6, 2008 to December 31, 2008, the crew was made up of a career Lieutenant and a casual worker taken from the station's own volunteers. On January 1, 2009 the station was officially manned with career staff, Monday to Friday, with anywhere between 2 and 4 personnel, depending on the needs. Martinique Beach Provincial Park Located at the end of the East Petpeswick Rd, Martinique Beach is the longest sandy beach in Nova Scotia. This 5 kilometre long beach is a provincial park which boasts both picnic and swimming facilities. The excellent surf conditions at Martinique Beach draw in surfers from all over. The beach is named after Prince Edward who took part in the 1794 Capture of Martinique.http://www.canadiancrown.com/prince-edward-and-nova- scotia.htmlNote. There is also the possibility that it was named after Lt Governor of Nova Scotia George Pr√©vost Invasion of Martinique (1809). There is a wildlife sanctuary adjacent to Martinique Beach. Canada Geese and Black Ducks can often be seen during migratory periods. There is even a protected nesting area for the Piping Plover, an endangered species.  Yacht Club  Just 2 kilometers down the East Petpeswick Road is Petpeswick Yacht Club. PYC is home to a learn-to-sail program, small marina and a kayaking program. The yacht club hosts an annual regatta-the Shearwater to Petpeswick Race, Canada Day festivities and a number of dances and social events throughout the year.

History A Planet Fitness location in Revere, Massachusetts in November 2012 Planet Fitness locations in the United States In 1992, Michael and Marc Grondahl acquired a struggling Gold's Gym franchise in Dover, New Hampshire. They closed that original location, and in 1993 they opened a new location named Coastal Fitness. They brought on a third partner, current CEO Chris Rondeau, and in 1994 they changed their name to Planet Fitness. Michael Grondahl bought the Planet Fitness trademark from Rick Berks in 2002. Rick Berks had started his own Planet Fitness gym in 1993 in Sunrise, Florida, and eventually expanded it to three clubs. A former Broward Sheriff‚Äôs Office detective, he owned and operated a Gold's Gym franchise. Berks had been catering to the bodybuilding culture in his Gold‚Äôs Gym. ‚ÄúI decided I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that crowd, so that‚Äôs when I opened the original Planet Fitness club in Sunrise, Florida, in 1993.‚Äù The name came from his daughter‚Äôs school project, ‚ÄúFitness Planet.‚Äù The new model was an effort to provide a fitness hub for everyday people. Berks later went on to open the first Youfit Health Club in St. Petersburg, Florida. Rondeau and the Grondahls recognized that there was a greater opportunity to serve a much larger segment of the population if they changed the gym environment, both in attitude and format, by creating a non- intimidating, low-cost model. Planet Fitness became known as the \\"Judgement Free Zone,\\" aimed more at the average user than the bodybuilder type of fitness enthusiast. They also dramatically reduced prices to compete against better-known brands. This low-cost business model focuses on the needs of occasional or first-time health club members, rather than more experienced members, and depends on many members rarely showing up. According to a Planet Money episode from 2014, \\"half of the Planet Fitness members don't ever go to their gyms.\\" As part of their effort to create a non-intimidating environment, Planet Fitness has alienated many serious weight lifters. Some bodybuilders and weight lifters have found the way they're portrayed in Planet Fitness TV commercials to be offensive, and the way they're treated in Planet Fitness gyms to be \\"quite possibly discriminatory.\\" Planet Fitness has been criticized for prohibiting certain weightlifting exercises‚Äìsuch as deadlifts and clean- and-jerks‚Äìthat many experts believe are highly effective. In 2010, Men's Health magazine called Planet Fitness \\"the worst gym in America.\\" As early as March 2015, the \\"Judgement Free Zone\\" policy has been expanded to allow trans women to use the women's locker room. The policy states that \\"members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.\\" In 2003, Planet Fitness opened its first franchised location in Florida, with Eric Dore and Shane McGuiness. In the fall of 2013, TSG Consumer Partners LLC became an equity partner in the Planet Fitness franchise. Michael Grondahl, co-founder of Planet Fitness stepped down as CEO, and was succeeded by Chris Rondeau. The company went public on August 6, 2015. In February 2016, the franchise was added to the Franchise Times \\"Fast and Serious\\" list of top franchises (#1), and in its 2016 ranking of franchises, Forbes magazine ranked Planet Fitness #4. It ranked in the top 50 of Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500 in 2017. In 2020, the company received criticism for charging its customers for March dues \\"despite closing its facilities nationwide due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.\\" They stated that they were unable to stop the pre-scheduled payments on short notice, but would not charge future monthly dues until they reopen, and would also provide a credit for closed days previously paid for. Statistics and international expansion The company reports that as of 2019, there are 80 corporate-owned gyms, the rest independently owned and operated. The club's two membership levels are $10 and $22.99 per month: the $10 per month level includes access to cardio and strength equipment, unlimited group fitness instruction and pizza and bagels once a month; the $22.99 per month (\\"Black Card\\") level allows members to bring one guest per day at no charge, access to all Planet Fitness locations, and access to extra amenities, such as tanning booths, massage chairs, red light therapy and water massage beds. In December 2014, Planet Fitness opened its first international location in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The second Toronto location opened in early 2015. In October 2015 the company opened their second international location in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. With the addition of a Planet Fitness outlet in Hawaii in January 2018, Planet Fitness had 1,500 locations with an estimated 10 million members across 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama and Canada. In 2016, over 90% of Planet Fitness locations were opened by existing franchise owners. Sponsorships In October 2011, Planet Fitness reached an agreement with NBC to sponsor the network's reality show, The Biggest Loser beginning with the 2012 season. The contestants on the show worked out on Planet Fitness equipment and then at Planet Fitness gyms near their homes, working with Planet Fitness instructors. In March 2013, Planet Fitness partnered with 50 Cent to sell his energy drink \\"Street King\\". Since December 2014, Planet Fitness has been the official fitness sponsor of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on ABC. In March 2016, Planet Fitness partnered with STOMP Out Bullying,STOMP Out Bullying a national organization dedicated to bullying prevention, and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to launch the company's national philanthropic initiative, The Judgement Free Generation. Also in 2016, the company donated more than $1 million to the program. Planet Fitness has also provided mini \\"Judgement Free Zone\\" gyms to Boys & Girls Clubs in Manchester, New Hampshire and Pasadena, California. In October 2017, Planet Fitness and its members raised $1 million which it donated to the non- profit Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In January 2020, Planet Fitness partnered with The Biggest Loser, to be the official sponsor of the show's 2020 reboot.

In 1979, the U.S. Economic Development Administration provided a grant to the college which covered the construction of five new modern structures for science, vocational training, the fine arts, and nursing. The college also added a cafe and gym. A new library was constructed at the college in 2003.https://www.pdx.edu/exito/american-samoa-community-college World War II In April 1942, the village of Mapusaga was eventually displaced in favor of the construction of Mobile Base Hospital Three (MOB 3). Eventually, there were as many as 105 buildings covering thirty acres of land at Mapusaga, which required over 300 tons of cargo in order to be built. During the process of construction and relocation of villagers, a chief known as Savea, his wife Lupe and other displaced villagers were unfailingly gracious. When the first Marine casualties began arriving from the fighting at Guadalcanal and Tulagi, the girls of Mapusaga village showed up at MOB 3 bringing the men flowers. The tanks stationed at Mapusaga were festooned with garlands of flowers, and families gathered around the Marines in support and gave them gifts as they boarded the trucks and left Mapusaga to go to war.Kennedy, Joseph (2009).

It lasted for 15 seasons and was interrupted by two years (1917‚Äì18) in military service during World War I. He played for five Major League Baseball teams over all or parts of five seasons: the St. Louis Browns ( and ), St. Louis Cardinals (), Philadelphia Phillies (), Chicago Cubs () and Boston Braves (1932). Altogether, he appeared in 192 games, hitting .262 with 98 hits, including 15 doubles, four triples and 14 home runs. His best year, as a second-string catcher for the Cardinals, saw him set personal bests in most offensive categories.

Mysterious Luhansk Region: steppe pyramid and Princess Murat . Ukrinform. 1 February 2015 Supposedly the site was built in about 4000 BC, corresponding to the Dnieper-Donets or early Yamna culture, and remained in use throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age, until 5th century BC Sarmatia. It was discovered in 2004, and the discovery officially announced on 7 September 2006. Discovery and excavation The site was discovered in 2004 by school children participating in an archaeology camp organised by Alchevsk history teacher Vladimir Paramonov, who has been organising expeditions of schoolchildren to the hill range since 1995.Neva News 1 April 2007. It is believed that much of the site was constructed about 3000 BC, in the early Bronze Age. The site is believed to be a complex of temples and sacrificial altars topping a hill with sides sculpted into steps. Viktor Klochko, the archaeologist in charge of the dig site and deputy Minister of Science of the Tourism and Protection of Cultural Heritage Department of the Lugansk regional administration, said that the discovery was of international significance as the first monument of its kind found in Eastern Europe: :\\"It changes our whole conception of the social structure and the level of development of the cattle breeders and farmers who were the direct ancestors of most European peoples.\\" Archaeologists have confirmed that evidence of graves has been found at the Luhansk site, which they believe to have been the result of human sacrifice, rather than due to its use as a burial ground. According to The Guardian, remains of sacrifice victims, ashes and ceramics have been found at the site, but no jewellery or treasure. The complex has a base area of three-quarters of a square mile, is estimated to be 60 metres (192 ft) high, and was probably used for 2,000 years. In Kurgan No. 4, three graves of the Berezhnovsko- Maevskaya group of the Late Bronze Age Srubna culture were found above three graves of the Early Bronze Age Catacomb culture, with 13 graves and sacrificial pits. One of the skulls found was dated to ca. 3000 BC. Four stone statues were found near the graves. Misidentification as pyramid and clarification Initial reports indicated that archaeologists had discovered a pyramidal structure.PRAVDA: Ancient pyramids found in Ukraine; BBC News: 'Pyramids' discovered in Ukraine; Guardian Unlimited: Bronze Age pyramid found in Ukraine Klochko blamed the press: \\"I'm not sure where the pyramid idea came from - the media got it wrong,\\" says Klochko. \\"We didn't find anything like an Egyptian pyramid.

The song, a love ballad in a Chicago-/Philly-soul style, became a number-one hit on the Billboard's R&B; singles chart in the United States twice with two separate recordings: a 1976 version by Aretha Franklin from the film's soundtrack (see 1976 in music), and a 1992 cover by girl group En Vogue (see 1992 in music). Aretha Franklin version In the original 1976 version of the film Sparkle, the song is performed by \\"Sister & the Sisters\\", with Lonette McKee on lead vocal, and Irene Cara and Dwan Smith on backing vocals. The version of \\"Something He Can Feel\\" present on the film's soundtrack album replaces the vocal tracks with those of Aretha Franklin and the Kitty Haywood Singers, with the instrumental tracks remaining the same. Sparkle revolves around the lives of the members of Sister & the Sisters, a 1960s Motown-esque girl group, and \\"Something He Can Feel\\" is present in the film as part of their repertoire. Franklin's recording of the song was issued as the first single from the album, and became a number-one hit on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles chart, peaking at number twenty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Aretha's only pop Top 40 hit during the second half of the 1970s. Sparkle would be remade in 2012, as would \\"Something He Can Feel\\", this time performed by Carmen Ejogo on lead vocal with Jordin Sparks and Tika Sumpter on backing vocals. In an allusion to Aretha Franklin's version of the song and soundtrack, Sister & Her Sisters perform \\"Something He Can Feel\\" as part of a live TV performance headlined by Franklin.

Boy George version In 1988, a rap and Hip Hop artist, Afrika Bambaataa recorded a cover version of \\"Something He Can Feel\\". The cover, released on the album, The Light, a collaboration album with lead vocals on this song by Boy George. En Vogue version Fifteen years after Sparkle was released, R&B; group En Vogue recorded a cover version of \\"Something He Can Feel\\" (titled as \\"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\\"), produced by Thomas McElroy & Denzil Foster. The lead vocals are sung by Dawn Robinson and the background vocals are done by Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones. The En Vogue cover, released as the second single from the group's second album, Funky Divas, was also a successful hit. Ten years later, the group sampled the backbeat of their cover version of Christmas classic \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", which they recorded for their 2002 Christmas album, The Gift of Christmas. The single peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became the fifth En Vogue single in two years to peak at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a double A-side single with \\"Free Your Mind\\" and reached number 16, while in New Zealand, it became En Vogue's highest-charting single, peaking at number two for two weeks. Nichole Cordova performed the En Vogue's version of \\"Something He Can Feel\\" on the season finale of Pussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious where she became the first member of Girlicious. She received high praise from the judges.

Its civic numbers range from 950 to 4756 on the Halifax Peninsula street grid numbering system. Barrington Street is centrally located within the original Halifax street grid, laid out in the 18th century. It remains one of the main streets of the city and is home to numerous shops, office buildings, and the Halifax City Hall. History Barrington Street is part of the original street grid laid out by engineer John Bruce and surveyor Charles Morris when Halifax was established as a British fortress. The streets were named after leading British statesmen, but the origin of the name Barrington Street is reportedly unclear. One account suggests the street is named after William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington, who served as a Secretary of War but was an \\"unknown\\" in 1749 when Halifax was founded. Others say the street name is derived from a misspelling of the Earl of Harrington, the Secretary of State. Barrington Street sits halfway up the slope to Citadel Hill and has long been a main street of Halifax. After the town's founding it became a fashionable street for promenading. In 1766 the eastern sidewalk was planked and became known as the \\"mall\\" until it fell into disrepair in the 1820s and was dismantled. By the 19th century, Barrington Street was the main commercial district in Halifax. Horse-drawn streetcars began operating on Barrington Street in 1866. These were replaced by electric streetcars by 1896. The street saw big changes in the mid-20th century, with massive demolition under the banner of urban renewal. A huge swath of the downtown area, north of Duke Street, was cleared for the development of Scotia Square and the Cogswell Interchange. The Birk's Building at the George Street intersection, along with several adjacent smaller structures, were demolished in the early 1990s. This site is now under the ownership of the provincial government and remains one of the most prominent surface parking lots in the downtown core. Evolution Mural at 3308-3318 Barrington St. Today, Barrington Street stretches the length of the Halifax peninsula. However, the Barrington Street name originally only applied to the length of the street within downtown proper. South of Spring Garden Road, the street was called Pleasant Street. North of downtown (up to North Street), it was originally called Lockman Street. The remainder (everything north of North Street) was once called Campbell Road. The area between downtown and the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge changed drastically in the 20th century. In order to serve the bridge, hundreds of properties were demolished in this area and this section of Barrington Street was partially converted into a limited-access highway. No shops front on this section of the street anymore. As the area is separated from downtown by the Cogswell Interchange, few people walk along the road here. The construction of the multi-level Cogswell Interchange in 1970 separated Barrington Street into two discontinuous sections; the street now interchanges with itself at this point. That is, a driver heading south toward downtown who exits Barrington at the Cogswell Interchange will wind up on the south section of Barrington Street. Continuing straight through the interchange, Barrington splits into Hollis Street and Lower Water Street. The Cogswell Interchange is slated to be demolished in the near future. In the current redevelopment plans, Barrington Street would form a continuous street once again.

Baseball-reference.com. Retrieved May 21, 2017. In 18 seasons Picinich played in 1,037 games and hit .258 with 26 home runs and 298 RBI. He caught three no-hitters in his first eight major league seasons and he was the personal catcher for Walter Johnson for four seasons. He was a minor league manager after his playing career ended. He died of pneumonia in 1946. Career After spending one year at Princeton University, Picinich left school to pursue a professional baseball career with the Philadelphia Athletics. He debuted with the Athletics in 1916 and played with the team through 1917. From 1918 to 1922, Picinich played for the Washington Senators and was the personal catcher for Walter Johnson; he only sat out two of Johnson's games during that time. Picinich caught three no-hitters, all early in his career (one by Bullet Joe Bush, 1916; one by Johnson, 1920; and one by Howard Ehmke, 1923). Picinich may have had his best season for the Cincinnati Reds in 1928. He played in a major league career-high 96 games that year and hit .302. The next year, Picinich appeared in 93 games, but his batting average dropped to .260. He seemed to struggle defensively that year, leading the league in two dubious categories: passed balls (9) and stolen bases allowed (75). After 1929, Picinich never played in more than 41 major league games in any season. He last appeared in the major leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1933. In 1934, he wrote to Ford Frick to say that he was creating a baseball school in Brooklyn. Picinich then spent four seasons managing in the minor leagues. Later life After leaving baseball, Picinich bought a chicken farm in Maine. He then worked as the personnel service and morale director for Bath Iron Works. In 1942, Picinich contracted bronchial influenza and was diagnosed with pneumonia a few days later. He died in Nobleboro, Maine, at the age of 46. He was survived by his parents, a wife, and a daughter.

Pioneered by B.W. Batterman in the 1960s, the availability of synchrotron light has stimulated the application of this interferometric technique to a wide range of problems in surface science.  Basic principles  Principle of X-ray standing wave measurements An X-ray standing wave (XSW) field is created by interference between an X-ray beam impinging on a sample and a reflected beam. The reflection may be generated at the Bragg condition for a crystal lattice or an engineered multilayer superlattice; in these cases, the period of the XSW equals the periodicity of the reflecting planes. X-ray reflectivity from a mirror surface at small incidence angles may also be used to generate long-period XSWs. The spatial modulation of the XSW field, described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction, undergoes a pronounced change when the sample is scanned through the Bragg condition. Due to a relative phase variation between the incoming and reflected beams, the nodal planes of the XSW field shift by half the XSW period. Depending on the position of the atoms within this wave field, the measured element-specific absorption of X-rays varies in a characteristic way. Therefore, measurement of the absorption (via X-ray fluorescence or photoelectron yield) can reveal the position of the atoms relative to the reflecting planes. The absorbing atoms can be thought of as \\"detecting\\" the phase of the XSW; thus, this method overcomes the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. For quantitative analysis, the normalized fluorescence or photoelectron yield Y_p is described by Y_{p}(\\\\Omega) = 1 + R + 2C \\\\sqrt{R} f_H \\\\cos ( u - 2\\\\pi P_H ), where R is the reflectivity and u is the relative phase of the interfering beams. The characteristic shape of Y_p can be used to derive precise structural information about the surface atoms because the two parameters f_H (coherent fraction) and P_H (coherent position) are directly related to the Fourier representation of the atomic distribution function. Therefore, with a sufficiently large number of Fourier components being measured, XSW data can be used to establish the distribution of the different atoms in the unit cell (XSW imaging). Characteristic XSW yield (red lines) through the \\\\mathbf{H}=hkl Bragg condition for an absorbing atom at position \\\\mathbf{H}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}. The Bragg reflection, calculated by dynamical diffraction theory, is shown in green.  Experimental considerations  XSW measurements of single crystal surfaces are performed on a diffractometer. The crystal is rocked through a Bragg diffraction condition, and the reflectivity and XSW yield are simultaneously measured. XSW yield is usually detected as X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF detection enables in situ measurements of interfaces between a surface and gas or liquid environments, since hard X-rays can penetrate these media. While XRF gives an element- specific XSW yield, it is not sensitive to the chemical state of the absorbing atom. Chemical state sensitivity is achieved using photoelectron detection, which requires ultra-high vacuum instrumentation. Measurements of atomic positions at or near single crystal surfaces require substrates of very high crystal quality. The intrinsic width of a Bragg reflection, as calculated by dynamical diffraction theory, is extremely small (on the order of 0.001¬∞ under conventional X-ray diffraction conditions). Crystal defects such as mosaicity can substantially broaden the measured reflectivity, which obscures the modulations in the XSW yield needed to locate the absorbing atom. For defect- rich substrates such as metal single crystals, a normal-incidence or back- reflection geometry is used. In this geometry, the intrinsic width of the Bragg reflection is maximized. Instead of rocking the crystal in space, the energy of the incident beam is tuned through the Bragg condition. Since this geometry requires soft incident X-rays, this geometry typically uses XPS detection of the XSW yield.  Selected applications  Applications which require ultra-high vacuum conditions: * Physisorption and chemisorption studies * Diffusion of dopants in crystals * Superlattices and Quasi-crystal characterization Applications which do not require ultra-high vacuum conditions: * Langmuir-Blodgett films * Self-assembled monolayers * Model heterogeneous catalysts * Buried interfaces  See also  * List of surface analysis methods  References  Further reading Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Experimental physics Category:X-ray spectroscopy Standing ","title":"X-ray standing waves"},{"id":"6898479","text":"Korkut Boratav (born 1935) is a Turkish Marxian economist.

The same reference, and Federal Census Records, also indicate that Henry was a planter/farmer, woodcutter, and tanner, and that he was assisted by a free black gentleman, Robert Allen, at least two other single men, and at least one slave. Henry had one child, a son, John Robert Geiger, born out of wedlock, for whom he sought (and was granted) legitimacy through an act of the Florida State Assembly in 1850.

It was established upon recommendation of the World Conference on the International Women's Year 1975 in Mexico through the ECOSOC. INSTRAW started operations in 1979. Since 1983 its main offices were located in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with a focus on the advancement of women through research and training. The institute was financed through contributions, which are mostly given by governmental organizations or private donors. In 2011, INSTRAW was merged into UN Women.  About  INSTRAW worked to improve the economic and political lives of women around the world, improve their opportunities to communicate with one another, support sustainable and environmentally safe development and provide research and statistics on issues relating to gender. INSTRAW also held seminars and trainings in various languages in different countries. INSTRAW developed a worldwide online network, the Gender Awareness Information and Networking System (GAINS), to provide information and training on gender equality. Information and resources were available through GAINS via a searchable database.  History  INSTRAW was created following the First World Conference on Women in Mexico City in 1975. In Mexico City, participants decided that it was necessary to have research on issues relating to gender in order to make better policies regarding women throughout the world. It was also decided at the conference that INSTRAW would be based in a \\"developing country.\\" It was created with a voluntary budget that relied on contributions, rather than being funded out of the United Nations budget. On May 12, 1976, Resolution 1998 (LX) allowed the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to create INSTRAW. ECOSOC created a plan to develop INSTRAW in phases and mandated that INSTRAW should be in place by 1977. INSTRAW began working on research and training in January of 1980 and was accountable to the president of a board of directors, Delphine Tsanga. The first director of INSTRAW was Dunja Pastizzi-Ferencic, who started in 1981 and continued until 1990. Several countries bid on hosting the headquarters for INSTRAW, and for a while, it was going to be located in Tehran. However, after the Islamic Republic was founded in Iran, the country withdrew the invitation in January of 1979. Shortly after the withdrawal, it was suggested to locate headquarters in the Dominican Republic. The headquarters for INSTRAW had their grand opening in Santo Domingo in 1983. In the early 1980s, INSTRAW emphasized research and training as their most important priority. By 1985, INSTRAW developed as its main mandate that their research was about \\"ensuring that constant attention is paid to the integration of women at all levels of development activity.\\" INSTRAW also identified ways to provide training to women at different levels of opportunity. In 1993, there was a proposed merger of INSTRAW and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposed the merger as a way to streamline the activities and improve efficiency in the organizations. Committees overseeing the proposed merger decided that both INSTRAW and UNIFEM would suffer and individuals at the Fourth World Conference on Women, 1995 supported the different mandates of each separate organization. Later, further evaluations of the organization also found that keeping INSTRAW independent was important, as it was the only part of the UN that was mandated to provide research and training for women. The Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC) in 2003 requested a change be made to INSTRAW and the board of trustees was changed into an executive board with officials appointed by Member States. The new director in 2003 was Carmen Moreno. Going through these proposed and actual changes affected the work output of INSTRAW. In 1999, ECOSOC and the board of trustees for INSTRAW were directed to create a new working method for the organization. This led to the creation of the Gender Awareness Information and Networking System (GAINS). GAINS allowed individuals to access information from INSTRAW through the internet. INSTRAW began to work on the migration and development programme in 2005. In 2008, INSTRAW set up a database on information about women, peace and security. In July 2010, the General Assembly created UN Women which would absorb INSTRAW's mandates.  Directors  Directors of the organization are listed in the table below.

It was danced to the sound of the aulos; its time was quick and light, as is also shown by the metric foot called pyrrhic.The Cambridge Series for Schools and Training Colleges: Xenophon, Anabasis VI with vocabulary It was described by Xenophon in his work the Anabasis. In that work he writes that the dance was performed at a festival held in Trapezus to celebrate the arrival of the troops in the city. The following is the part in which the pyrrhic dance is mentioned: Homer refers to the Pyrrichios and describes how Achilles danced it around the burning funeral of Patroclus. The dance was loved in all of Greece and especially by the Spartans who considered it light war training. This belief led the Spartans to teach the dance to their children while they were still young. Athenian youth performed the dance in the palaestra as part of training in gymnastics. The dance was also performed in the Panathenaic Games. There were three classes of competitors: men, youth, and boys.

This is caused by cartilage rests that grow and reside within the metaphysis or diaphysis and eventually mineralize over time to form multiple enchondromas. Key signs of the disorder include asymmetry and shortening of the limb as well as an increased thickness of the bone margin. These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age. Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bone sarcomas that necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm. Cases in patients with Ollier disease has shown a link to IDH1, IDH2, and PTH1R gene mutations. Currently, there are no forms of treatment for the underlying condition of Ollier disease but complications such as fractures, deformities, malignancies that arise from it can be treated through surgical procedures. The prevalence of this condition is estimated at around 1 in 100,000. It is unclear whether the men or women are more affected by this disorder due to conflicting case studies. Presentation The disease consists of the growth multiple enchondromas which usually develop in early childhood. The growth of these enchondromas usually stops after skeletal maturation. The affected extremity is shortened (asymmetric dwarfism) and sometimes bowed due to epiphyseal fusion anomalies. Bone lesions generally present as cellular during childhood and become more solitary over time. People with Ollier disease are prone to breaking bones (fractures) and normally have swollen, aching limbs. However, many cases of solitary enchondromata go unnoticed due to lack of symptoms. Enchondromas are commonly found in the phalanges, metacarpal, and metatarsal bones in patients of Ollier disease due to the affinity of enchondromas to long tubular bones such as the femur and humerus. A unilateral distribution of bone lesions is usually observed but bilateral distributions or a singular extremity can occur as well. Approximately a third of the cases show some form of physical deformities of bowing or abnormal limb lengthening. Associated conditions Ollier disease carries a higher risk of malignancies such as central nervous system (CNS), ovarian, and adenocarcinoma. Cranial gliomas have been linked with this disorder at an increased rate and at an earlier diagnosis age. A majority of glioma cases contain IDH gene mutations thus explaining the link between the two conditions. Juvenile granulosa cell tumour has also been associated with the disease. One case study indicates that this is due a mesodermal dysplasia in the long bones resulting in ovarian cancer. The incidence of a secondary chondrosarcoma in Ollier disease is most commonly approximated at 25-30% with some projections even as high as 50%. Chondrosarcomas are typically developed during young adulthood and mostly form as a unifocal distribution in Ollier disease patients. The most common locations of tumors are in the pelvis and shoulder girdle. While chondrosarcoma is the most common form of a secondary malignant bone neoplasm found in cases of Ollier disease, other forms such as chordomas and osteosarcomas can occur. If left untreated, these malignant transformations may lead to fatal outcomes. A related and even rarer disorder named Maffucci syndrome is a very similar condition that is characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas with hemangiomas and occasionally lymphangiomas usually near the hands and feet but not limited to the skull, ribs, and spinal bones. This disorder is also sporadic and nonhereditary and usually detected during childhood despite being a congenital condition. Maffucci syndrome has also similarly been linked to IDH1 and IDH2 mutations specifically the IDH1 R132C hotspot mutation. This hotspot mutation is presumed to be responsible for the spindle cell hemangiomas and enchondromas in cases of Maffucci syndrome. Sanger sequencing analysis concluded that exon 4 is the primary location of mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 genes are specifically responsible for hemangiomas. Maffucci syndrome carries a significantly higher risk of malignant transformations like chondrosarcomas but also much more aggressive tumors such as acute lymphocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal and ovarian malignancies. Cause For many years, most research has been inconclusive regarding the cause of the disease. Recent studies have shown that most cases of Ollier disease are believed to have been caused by isocitrate dhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. In one study, 35 of 43 (81%) patients with Ollier disease had either a IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. Another study suggests that R132C IDH1 mutations which are particularly dominant at exon 4 of IDH genes are linked to the growth of vascular lesions. Isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 are catalysts responsible for the conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. The isocitrate deyhydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 mutations disrupt this process resulting in unregulated production of Œ±-ketoglutarate and a reduction in chondrocyte proliferation. In many cases of cartilaginous tumors, IDH1 and IDH2 point mutations were found thus explaining why Ollier disease is associated with many different associated conditions. Based on these case studies, most evidence suggests that the abnormal lining of lesions found in Ollier disease would suggest that the condition is caused by a post-zygotic somatic mutation thus resulting in a mosaic genetic disorder. Approximately 8-10% of cases of patients with Ollier disease have been linked to PTH1R mutations. A particular case study the mutant heterozygous PTHR1 (R150C) receptor was observed in two unrelated patients with Ollier disease. This PTHR1 (R150C) mutant causes a reduction in chondrocyte differentiation by triggering the PTHrP-dependent pathway and decreasing PTHLH receptor function by approximately 30% creating enchondromas. One of these patients with the PTHR1 (R150C) mutant was found to have inherited the mutation from his father. This provides credence to the theory that multiple genetic mutations are needed to occur in order for Ollier disease to manifest. An alternative theory suggests that since there have been cases of multiple family members with enchondromatosis, the disorder may be passed on through autosomal dominant inheritance. Diagnosis Clinical and radiological evaluations are conducted in order to detect the presence of bone neoplasms or lesions typically found in Ollier disease. Histological evaluations are mainly used to examine or detect malignancies. Abnormal bone growth such as shortening or thickening and deformity may be observed in patients of Ollier disease. These bone lesions are visible at birth using radiography but are usually not screened or examined for until clinical manifestations present during early childhood. However, some patients may exhibit no signs of any symptoms. One study found thirteen to be the mean age of diagnosis in patients with Ollier disease. In a roentgenogram, there would normally be the presence of several homogeneous lesions of an oval or elongated shape with bone edges that are slightly thickened. With age, these lesions may calcify and appear as diffusely minute spots or stippled. Fan-like septations or streaks would be indicative of the presence of several enchondromas. Early detection and consistent and repeated monitoring is important in order to prevent and treat any potential bone neoplasms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and scintigraphy are generally not practical for diagnostic purposes. X-rays are not as effective in the monitoring or evaluation of enchondromas due to frequent localized changes also sometimes due to the large number of enchondromas. MRI can sometimes however be used to monitor and evaluate symptomatic lesions in the case of potential malignant transformations. Similar disorders such as Maffucci syndrome and hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) require differentiation during diagnosis. Maffucci syndrome can be distinguished clinically by the presence of hemangiomas and lymphangiomas and genetically through R132C IDH1 hotspot mutations. HME features osteochondromas which are near the surface the bone whereas enchondromas featured in Ollier disease and Maffucci are more towards the center of the bone. Also, neural compressions are more commonly found in HME than in Ollier disease. Treatment The condition of Ollier disease cannot be treated for but the complications that arise such as fractures, growth defects, and tumors can be surgically treated. These are typically done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible. Fractures have been treated using a variety of methods such as bone grafting, internal fixation, corticoplasty, Ilizarov technique, elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN), and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN). Corticoplasty has been shown to have success in treating hand lesions and deformities while retaining normal function. The surgery utilizes the removal of tissue (curettage) and bone reconstruction in order to remove enchondromas and improve cosmetic appearance. Many cases of corticoplasty have been shown improvement in appearances while maintaining function. Recurrence of enchondromas was observed in some cases. In cases of Ollier disease, early surgical treatment of enchondromas in the hand is recommended. The Ilizarov technique is a form of noninvasive treatment that can sometimes be used to reshape and correct deformities and misaligned limb bones. It uses the process of external fixation through the scaffolding of pins or wires into the bone in an attempt to transform enchondromata into normal bone tissue. This method of treatment is very safe but is also very strenuous as it a long-term procedure. The ring fixators used in the Ilizarov technique have been shown to be very versatile for realigning and lengthening limb bones while also managing soft tissue tension. Complications from this procedure may include a recurrence in limb lengthening complications such as premature healing requiring osteoclasis and a return of angular deformities. Reduced latency periods followed by faster distraction times are encouraged in order to prevent premature healing.The Ilizarov technique has shown to have positive outcomes for many cases of Ollier disease with some patients even experiencing full correction of deformity and length in best cases scenarios. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) are more recent surgical procedures that also utilize external fixation that has been shown to reduce the Healing Index and minimize complications. Similarly to the Ilizarov technique, the procedure is intended to correct deformities and elongate limb bones. This form of treatment is not suitable for the elongation of bones with a small shaft diameter or sections containing open growth zones. Patients with severe forms of Ollier disease also are not suited for surgery because of an increased risk of complications due to bone frame instability. Both the elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) use two bent elastic nails in order to allow for greater realignment and stability. This technique used in conjunction with a circular external fixator has been shown to significantly reduce Healing Index values in both monosegmental and polysegmental lengthening. Another advantage is that no fractures or deformities were found in later follow ups of 2 to 5 years. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing system (ESIN) requires a longer duration of external fixation for most procedures compared to flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN). Malignant transformations of any or multiple enchondromas are common in patients with Ollier disease and typically emerge in young adults often requiring surgery. The average age of patients of Ollier disease for their first surgery to treat their chondrosarcoma is thirty-three. Some examples of surgical procedures performed to treat secondary malignant bone neoplasms from Ollier disease include amputation, wide-local excisions, hemipelvectomy, and arthroplasty. Cobalt and chemotherapy are typically not primary methods of surgery as chondrosarcomas generally do not have enough blood supply to make it an effective form of treatment. These are done to treat and remove any extraneous bone tissue while preserving the function of limb if possible. Epidemiology One out of every 100,000 people is estimated to have Ollier disease. However, this estimate may be low due to under reporting of cases from asymptomatic or mild conditions. There are many contradicting studies that report different prevalence rates between genders as one study indicates that it affects both sexes equally while other studies purporting that it affects men or women more frequently. The average age of diagnosis is 13 years. Ollier disease is not normally diagnosed until early childhood due to lack of visible symptoms present at birth despite lesions being present using radiography. Although most research suggests that Ollier disease is spontaneous and nonhereditary, there are some cases where it appears among family members. Eponyms The disorder is named after French surgeon Louis L√©opold Ollier. Late in the 19th century, Ollier was one of the first to distinguish between enchondromatosis and this condition by highlighting the pattern of abnormal and asymmetrical enchondromas distributions in Ollier disease.

Between January 1943 and May 1943 the airfield was used by No. 17 OTU which used Bristol Blenheims. 355th Fighter Group With the departure of the photo-recon squadrons, the 355th Fighter Group, arrived from Philadelphia Municipal Airport on 9 July 1943. The group was under the command of the 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group were identified by white around their cowling and tail. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 354th Fighter Squadron (WR) * 357th Fighter Squadron (OS) * 358th Fighter Squadron (YF) The 355th FG flew its first combat mission, a fighter sweep over Belgium, on 14 September 1943 and afterwards served primarily as escort for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress/Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that attacked industrial areas of Berlin, marshalling yards at Karlsruhe, an airfield at Neuberg, oil refineries at Misburg, synthetic oil plants at Gelsenkirchen, locks at Minden, and other objectives. The group also flew fighter sweeps, area patrols, and bombing missions, striking such targets as air parks, locomotives, bridges, radio stations, and armoured cars. On 5 April 1944, shortly after converting from Republic P-47 Thunderbolts to North American P-51 Mustangs, the group successfully bombed and strafed German airfields during a snow squall, a mission for which the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. The group provided fighter cover for Allied forces landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944, and afterwards hit transportation facilities to cut enemy supply lines. Hit fuel dumps, locomotives, and other targets in support of ground forces during the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July. The 355th Fighter Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945. On 3 July the group transferred to Gablingen, Germany for duty with United States Air Forces in Europe as part of the army of occupation.

This aircraft was lost on 11 September 1944 - Capt Kevin G Rafferty KIA. 4th Fighter Group The 4th Fighter Group transferred to Steeple Morden in July 1945 replacing the 355th FG. The unit stayed until November when it returned to Camp Kilmer New Jersey and was inactivated. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 334th Fighter Squadron * 335th Fighter Squadron * 336th Fighter Squadron Postwar use With the departure of the Americans, Steeple Morden was transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 1 November 1945 and then was closed down on 1 September 1946 and abandoned. It was sold to private interests between 1960 and 1961 and was largely returned to agriculture. Current use With the end of military control, Steeple Morden was returned to agricultural use. The former airfield is virtually unrecognizable. A few single-width concrete farm roads, which are remnants of the perimeter track and runways are all that remains.

The book was composed in the early Song dynasty.K. S. Tom. [1989] (1989). Echoes from Old China: Life, Legends and Lore of the Middle Kingdom. University of Hawaii Press. . It originally contained 411 surnames, and was later expanded to 504. Of these, 444 are single-character surnames, and 60 are double-character surnames. About 800 names have been derived from the original ones.Chen, Janey. [1992] (1992). A Practical English-Chinese Pronouncing Dictionary. Tuttle Publishing. In the dynasties following the Song, the Three Character Classic, the Hundred Family Surnames, and Thousand Character Classic came to be known as San Bai Qian (Three, Hundred, Thousand), from the first character in their titles, and were the enlightenment books for children. They were the almost universal introductory literary texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers. Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, he had a knowledge of roughly 2,000 characters. Since Chinese did not use an alphabet, this was an effective, though time-consuming, way of giving a \\"crash course\\" in character recognition before going on to understanding texts and writing characters. Form The work is a rhyming poem in lines of eight characters. The surnames are not listed in order of commonality. According to Song dynasty scholar Wang Mingqing (ÁéãÊòéÊ∏Ö), the first four surnames listed represent the most important families in the empire at the time: *1st: Zhao () is the surname of the Song dynasty emperors. *2nd: Qian () is the surname of the kings of Wuyue. *3rd: Sun () is the surname of the queen Sun Taizhen of Wuyue king Qian Chu. *4th: Li () is the surname of the kings of Southern Tang. The next four, Zhou Âë®, Wu Âê≥, Zheng ÈÑ≠, and Wang Áéã, were the surnames of the other wives of Qian Chu, the last king of Wuyue. Complete text This text is written in Traditional Chinese.

Since 2017, he has been the New York State Senator for New York's 49th Senate District, which includes parts of Saratoga, Schenectady and Herkimer Counties and all of Fulton and Hamilton Counties. A Republican, Tedisco served in the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 2017. He was the Assembly Minority Leader from November 2005 until his resignation from that post in April 2009. In 2009, Tedisco was the Republican nominee in a special election for the 20th US Congressional District to fill the seat vacated by Kirsten Gillibrand following Gillibrand's appointment to the United States Senate; he was defeated by Democrat Scott Murphy. Early life, education, early career, and family life Jim Tedisco graduated from Bishop Gibbons High School in 1968,, dodged Vietnam, and received his B.A. in Psychology from Union College. While at Union, he played varsity basketball for three years where he set 15 scoring and assist records, and left as Union's all-time leading scorer with 1,632 points. Tedisco earned multiple athletic awards during his college career, and was inducted into the Union Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1997, he was given the Silver Anniversary Award from the NCAA. Tedisco got a graduate degree in Special Education from the College of Saint Rose. From 1973 to 1982, Tedisco worked in education; he served as a guidance counselor, basketball coach, and athletic director at Notre Dame-Bishop Gibbons High School in Schenectady, and later worked as a special education teacher, resource room instructor and varsity basketball coach at Bethlehem Central High School in Delmar, New York. Tedisco entered public service in 1977 when, at the age of 27, he was elected to the Schenectady City Council. Tedisco is a resident of Glenville, New York, where he lives with his wife and stepson. New York State Assembly Elections In 1982, Assemblyman Clark Wemple retired from the State Assembly, leaving an opening in the district. Tedisco won a four-way race in Republican primary, and then won the general election. Due to redistricting, Tedisco represented the 107th District from 1983 to 1993, the 103rd District from 1993 to 2003, the 110th District from 2003 to 2012, and most recently represented the 112th District since from 2012 to 2017. The 112th District consists of portions of Schenectady County and Saratoga County, including the towns of Greenfield, Providence, Milton, Galway, Ballston, Charlton, Clifton Park, Halfmoon, and Glenville. Tedisco ran uncontested in the 2008 general election and won the 2010 general election with 64 percent of the vote. Tenure Tedisco introduced \\"Charlotte's Law\\" to permanently terminate driver's license privileges for drunk and dangerous drivers. While Tedisco's bill was not passed, the DMV enacted regulations similar to what was proposed in the bill. In 1999, Tedisco worked to pass Buster's Law, which protected pets by making animal cruelty a felony, and in 2011 advocated for New York State Animal Advocacy Day. In 2014, Tedisco sponsored a constitutional amendment, Proposition 2, that would replace bill printouts with digital copies of bills. Assembly Minority Leader Tedisco served as Assembly Minority Leader from November 2005 to April 2009. According to The New York Times, Tedisco \\"clashed loudly and publicly\\" with Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer. In January 2007, Spitzer reportedly told Tedisco, \\"'I am a fucking steamroller and I‚Äôll roll over you or anybody else'\\". Tedisco was noted for his opposition to Spitzer's September 2007 executive order directing that state offices allow undocumented immigrants to be issued driver's licenses. Tedisco threatened a lawsuit if the plan was implemented. On November 14, 2007, Spitzer announced he would withdraw the driver license plan, acknowledging that it would never be implemented. Tedisco later accused Spitzer of cutting $300,000 of state funding for health care and education grants in the Schenectady area as retaliation for Tedisco's opposition to the Spitzer driver license plan.Dicker, Fredric U., Young & Poor Hit Hardest, New York Post. Tedisco accused the Governor of \\"dirty tricks\\" and \\"bullying\\".Tedisco Accuses Spitzer of 'Dirty Tricks,' 'Bullying' October 17, 2007 Following reports of Spitzer's involvement in a prostitution scandal, Tedisco called for his resignation and announced that he would initiate impeachment proceedings in the State Assembly if Spitzer did not resign.\\"Republicans Set Deadline For Governor's Ousting: 'I've Asked Him To Resign'\\".

Though not a resident of the district,\\"Election day in wild NY House race\\" by Associated Press, Boston Herald, November 3, 2009 Tedisco became its Republican nominee on January 27, 2009, and ran against Democrat Scott Murphy. The initial count from the election had Murphy leading by 59 votes, out of over 155,000 cast on March 31, 2009. This tally reportedly did not include any of the 10,000 requested absentee ballots, which needed only to have been postmarked by that date and could have been returned as late as April 7 (domestically) or April 13 (internationally). Eventually, about 7,000 absentee ballots were received; the vote count as of April 24 had Murphy ahead by 399 votes. On April 24, Tedisco conceded the election to Murphy. New York State Senate In 2016, Senator Hugh Farley announced that he would not seek re-election to the Senate. Farley's retirement left an opening in the 49th State Senate District.

The last track on the album is one of Zappa's most famous and renowned compositions. It features backing vocals by Tina Turner and the Ikettes throughout the entire track, notably on the middle and ending sections.  Song structure  The structure of \\"Montana\\" is intro-verses- chorus-solo-middle section-verses-outro. The lyrics, sung by Zappa in a humorous manner, talk about a person who decides to go to Montana to grow \\"a crop of dental floss,\\" mounting a pony named \\"Mighty Little.\\" He dreams to become a \\"dental floss tycoon,\\" by commercializing it. The verses are filled with pseudo-ranch pronunciation and are intended to be very lighthearted. At 1:55, right after the chorus, Zappa plays a long guitar solo. Then, there's a complex middle section with vocals (performed by Tina Turner & The Ikettes, uncredited) backed by percussion, singing some of the verses. Zappa follows singing the last verses and finally there's the coda, where the line from the chorus (\\"Moving to Montana soon...,\\" sung by Tina Turner and the Ikettes) is repeated constantly and answered by a high-pitched \\"Yippy-Aye-O-Ty-Ay\\" (sung by Kin Vassy). This goes on until it fades out towards the six-and-a-half minute mark. Of the Ikettes' harmonies, Zappa later said: :‚ÄùIt was so difficult, that one part in the middle of the song \\"Montana\\", that the three girls rehearsed it for a couple of days. Just that one section. You know the part that goes \\"I'm pluckin' the ol' dennil floss...\\"? Right in the middle there. And one of the harmony singers got it first. She came out and sang her part and the other girls had to follow her track. Tina was so pleased that she was able to sing this that she went into the next studio where Ike was working and dragged him into the studio to hear the result of her labor. He listened to the tape and he goes, ‚ÄòWhat is this shit?‚Äô and walked out\\".  Live  \\"Montana\\" quickly became a fan favorite and was often performed, especially during the 1973-1975, 1982, 1984 and 1988 tours. On stage, Zappa often altered the lyrics of the song and sometimes even the structure, to great extent. The version featured on You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2, (\\"Whipping Floss\\") is an example of when he did this. Before the song starts, a fan asks them to play The Allman Brothers Band's song \\"Whipping Post.\\" Frank jokes with the audience that they do not know the tune, Frank (after playing a couple of jokes on the guy and the audience) chooses to play \\"Montana\\" instead, yet he alters the lyrics, which later forces George Duke and Napoleon Murphy Brock to pay attention with the vocal backing (and they do fumble at one part). Meanwhile, at the beginning of the song, the band starts playing very fast, which causes Ruth Underwood and Chester Thompson to stumble at the drum fill, leading to more jokes from the rest of the band. The end of the song is a very long guitar solo, that around 9:55 turns into some kind of funk jam, and finally segues into a short version of \\"Big Swifty.\\"  Other  The song (with the solo edited out) was the B-Side of \\"I'm the Slime\\" (1973) and many years later, put on the Strictly Commercial compilation.

The tumors most commonly appear in the bones of the hands, feet, and limbs, causing bone deformities and short limbs. It is named for the Italian pathologist Angelo Maffucci who described it in 1881. Fewer than 200 cases of this syndrome have been reported. Signs and symptoms Patients are normal at birth and the syndrome manifests during childhood and puberty. The enchondromas affect the extremities and their distribution is asymmetrical. The most common sites of enchondromas are the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the hands. The feet are less commonly afflicted. Disfigurations of the extremities are a result. Pathological fractures can arise in affected metaphyses and diaphyses of the long bones and are common (26%). The risk for sarcomatous degeneration of enchondromas, hemangiomas, or lymphangiomas is 15-30% in the setting of Maffucci syndrome. Maffucci syndrome is associated with a higher risk of CNS, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies. Multiple enchondromas may present in 3 disorders: Ollier disease, Maffucci syndrome, and metachondromatosis. It is important to make the distinction between these diseases, particularly Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome. Ollier disease is more common than Maffucci syndrome, and presents with multiple enchondromas often in a unilateral distribution. However, hemangiomas and lymphangiomas are not seen in Ollier disease. Metachondromatosis demonstrates autosomal-dominant transmission and presents with both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas. It is associated with multiple cavernous hemangioma and phlebolith. Also lymphangiomas may be apparent. Cause Maffucci syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 gene. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis In Ollier disease isolated enchondromas are present without the presence of hemangiomas. Management Management entails careful examination and monitoring for malignant degenerations. Surgical interventions can correct or minimize deformities.

Since the investigation was still under way, Nasik Superintendent of Police Rajvardhan declined to give details, saying: \\"We can't say anything till we get reports from all the agencies\\".Indian Express However, the Anti Terroris Squad has prima facie ruled out the involvement of Hindu Nationalist groups like the Bajrang Dal in the Malegaon blasts citing two reasons: # RDX is only available to Islamist outfits. # Bajrang Dal activists so far have only used crude bombs, nothing as sophisticated as the ones in Malegaon. Ajai Sahni, an intelligence analyst who tracks terrorist groups in South Asia, also said it was unlikely to be a Hindu group because they \\"lacked the organisation for such an attack\\". On 12 September 2006, Indian Prime Minister said it was inappropriate to \\"rule out or rule in\\" the involvement of Hindu groups. \\"I think there should be a fair investigation which inspires confidence and brings out the truth and nothing but the truth without any pre-conceived notion. That has to be the objective\\".PM Not OK With 'Rule Out, Rule In' of Hindus Samachar B. Raman, in an op-ed published on 11 September, noted that \\"while it is too early to rule out the possibility of either Islamic or Hindu extremists as the perpetrators, there have been \\"attempts by some leaders of the Muslim community to create a divide between the community and the police by questioning the impartiality of the police and levelling other allegations against the investigating officers\\". As of 30 October 2006, the most recent arrests involved members of the Students Islamic Movement of India and suspicions are presently directed at them as, after the arrests, the police have claimed to be closer to solving the case. On 28 November 2006, Mumbai police stated that two Pakistani nationals were involved in the explosions. \\"We have successfully detected the Malegaon blasts case. We are, however, on the lookout for eight more suspects in the case,\\" said DGP PS Pasricha. The Anti-Terrorism Squad probing into the case has already arrested eight suspects, including two booked in the 11 July Mumbai serial blasts, in connection with four explosions that rocked the town killing 31 people and injuring more than 200. Three accused gave a confession about their involvement in the conspiracy, but soon after, two of them retracted before a magistrate, saying they had not made a voluntary disclosure. This was revealed to a special court by the accused themselves when they were produced before it for remand. The development assumes significance as under MCOCA, a confession does not have evidential value if it is not a voluntary and true disclosure. Seeking their remand, public prosecutor Raja Thakre said the accused had played a vital role in the conspiracy and investigations conducted by Anti- Terrorist Squad so far had revealed involvement of more persons who are yet to be arrested. On 16 November 2011 Seven accused in the Malegaon blasts were released on bail. After taking over the case NIA contradicted the ATS and CBI findings.ATS arrested four persons namely Lokesh Sharma, Dhan Singh, Manohar Singh and Rajendra Choudhary.On 22 May 2013 they were all chargesheeted. And Suspicion shifted from SIMI to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu right wing group. On 25 April 2016 all charges were dropped against the Muslim men by Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court who were arrested by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad in 2006.

Arnott (born June 29, 1954) is an American entrepreneur, investor, editor and writer who focuses on articles about quantitative investing. He serves as chairman of Research Affiliates, LLC, which advises on over $195 billion in investment assets, as of September 2018. He is married with four children. He edited CFA Institute's Financial Analysts Journal from 2002‚Äì2006, and has edited three books on equity management and tactical asset allocation. He is a co-author of the book The Fundamental Index: A Better Way to Invest, and co-editor of three other books relating to asset allocation and equity market investing. Arnott has also served as a Visiting Professor of Finance at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, on the editorial board of the Journal of Portfolio Management, the product advisory board of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. He previously served as Chairman of First Quadrant, LP, as global equity strategist at Salomon (now Salomon Smith Barney), president of TSA Capital Management (now TSA/Analytic), and as vice president at the Boston Company. Arnott has received seven Graham and Dodd Scrolls and Awards, awarded annually by the CFA Institute for best articles of the year, and has received three Bernstein-Fabozzi/Jacobs-Levy awards from the Journal of Portfolio Management and Institutional Investor magazine. Education Arnott graduated summa cum laude from UCSB in 1977 with a degree in economics, applied mathematics and computer science. While a high school student in 1970, he attended the Summer Science Program. Writing Arnott has published over 100 academic papers in refereed journals. Topics of these papers have included the following: mutual fund returns, the equity risk premium, tactical asset allocation, and alternative index investing. * 2000, \\"Investment Management Reflections,\\" with Andrew L. Berkin and Jia Ye. This paper argued that not only did 75% of actively managed equity mutual funds underperform the Vanguard S&P; 500 Index Fund but that after taking into account taxation, 66 out of the 71 mutual funds in the sample underperformed. A later study that looked at the 1990s found that 322 out of 355 mutual funds in the sample underperformed the Vanguard S&P; 500 Index Fund after tax. * 2002, \\"What Risk Premium is 'Normal'?\\" with Peter Bernstein. This paper argued that much of previous stock market returns had come from price-to-earnings ratio expansion and dividend yields, the former of which is unsustainable and the latter of which is historically low. Therefore, stock market returns will be lower in the long-term than they have historically been. (Note: The final page of this report is clearly labeled as an advertisement) Arnott and Bernstein were awarded the Graham and Dodd Award for excellence in financial writing for this article. * 2003, \\"Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth,\\" with Cliff Asness. This paper stated that against traditional theory, that the more a public company paid out in dividends, the greater that company's earnings grew. Results were statistically significant and robust with respect to time period and after controlling for the investment-to-GDP ratio, earnings yield, and the slope of the yield curve. * 2005, \\"Fundamental Indexation\\" with Jason Hsu and Philip Moore. This paper introduced the idea of weighting indices by fundamentals instead of capitalization, stating that indices weighted by fundamentals tend to outperform indices weighted by capitalization with similar volatility. This paper was the recipient of the William F. Sharpe best-index related research paper award. Research Affiliates' fundamentally based indexes won the award for the most innovative benchmark index. * 2008, The Fundamental Index: A Better Way to Invest. This book, published by Wiley Press and co-authored with Jason Hsu and John West, examines in detail how the Fundamental Index approach to investing can overcome the structural return drag created by traditional capitalization-weighted index strategies. * 2009, \\"Clairvoyant Value and the Value Effect\\" with Feifei Li and Katy Sherrerd. Using the prism of \\"clairvoyant value\\" - the net present value of all future cash flows on an investment, which is only known long after-the-fact for stocks in decades past - this paper and related subsequent paper demonstrate that the market does a superb job of differentiating which stocks deserve premium valuation multiples, but then pays too much for them. Selected as the lead article in the Spring 2009 Journal of Portfolio Management. * 2012, \\"Demographic Changes, Financial Markets, and the Economy\\" with Denis Chaves. Spanning sixty years of data in two dozen economies, this paper demonstrates that demography plays a very important role in shaping GDP growth and capital market returns. It strongly suggests that the developed world should prepare for slower GDP growth in the years ahead, and softer stock and bond returns in the 2020s and beyond. This paper was selected as the lead article for the January/February 2012 issue of the Financial Analysts Journal, and went on to win a Graham and Dodd Scroll. * 2013, \\"The Surprising Alpha from Malkiel's Monkey and Upside- Down Strategies\\" with Jason Hsu, Vitali Kalesnik, and Phil Tindall. This paper documents that many of the popular so-called \\"smart beta\\" strategies work just as well, if not better, when turned upside-down, with their smallest and largest holdings reversed. In so doing, the paper demonstrates that the key to the success of these strategies is not the advertised method of the strategy, but the mere act of breaking the link between a stock's price and its weight in the portfolio. This paper was one of three winners of a Bernstein-Fabozzi/Jacobs-Levy Award, as one of the best articles in 2013 in the Journal of Portfolio Management. Research Affiliates, LLC In 2002, Arnott founded Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, California-based investment management firm. As of September 30, 2018, about $195 billion in assets are managed worldwide using investment strategies developed by Research Affiliates. The firm has been involved with fundamentally based indexes since mid-2004 and has worked with the FTSE Group to create indices based on this methodology.\\"How to Corral an Index Fund (with a new rope)\\", January 21, 2007, The New York Times On January 8, 2006, Research Affiliates sold a minority interest in the company to Nomura Asset Management. Press Release listed at Yahoo! Finance In November, 2009, Research Affiliates was granted a patent for their index methodology that selects and weights securities using fundamental measures of company size. Political contributions Arnott has given $750,000 to support the Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group. Arnott considers himself a libertarian, and opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2015, Arnott donated $100,000 to America's Liberty PAC, a political action committee formed in support of Rand Paul's 2016 presidential bid.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rand-paul-super- pac_55b28c43e4b0074ba5a48427 Publications # \\"Is Your Alpha Big Enough to Cover Its Taxes?

In introducing the Bill, Baroness Ashton said that it was intended \\"to tackle perceptions that can lead to a disproportionate fear of litigation and risk averse behaviour; to find ways to discourage and resist bad claims; and to improve the system for those with a valid claim for compensation.\\" The Act brought in specific changes to the law of liability and damages in negligence and breach of statutory duty. It further introduced a scheme of regulation for claims management companies. Liability Section 1 of the Act makes statutory provision that, in determining whether the omission of certain steps amounts to a breach of duty, the court may consider whether such steps, had they been performed, would prevent some desirable activity. For example, the court must consider whether precautionary and defensive measures might prevent something socially useful. Though this principle had often been observed by the common law (see Miller v Jackson 1977, Denning's judgment), the Act places it on a statutory footing.Daborn v. Bath Tramways Motor Co Ltd & Trevor Smithey [1946] 2 All ER 333, CA, at 336Miller v. Jackson [1977] QB 966, CABolton v. Stone [1951] AC 850, HL Section 2 stipulates that, in the event of an accident, an apology or offer or redress, such as paying for medical treatment, is not, of itself an admission of liability. Sections 1 and 2 came into force on royal assent on 25 July 2006 (s.16(1)). Damages Asbestos fibres - a single fibre is believed to cause mesothelioma Section 3 reverses the common law rule on allocation of damages in various mesothelioma claims arising from unlawful exposure to asbestos. In 2002, the House of Lords ruled in Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services LtdFairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services (2002) UKHL 22 see also wikipedia article that, where several parties had unlawfully exposed the claimant to asbestos and risk of pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, all were liable for his injury, even though the claimant could not prove which individual party had provided the asbestos fibers that cause the disease. However, in Barker v Corus (UK) plcBarker v Corus (UK) plc (2006) UKHL 20 see also wikipedia article the House of Lords took Fairchild further and held that the parties who contributed to the risk were severally but not jointly liable. This meant that any single tortfeasor was liable to compensate the loss that the claimant suffered from mesothelioma only to the extent that that tortfeasor was itself responsible for the increase in risk. E.g. if the tortfeasor that the claimant chose to sue was found to have only contributed 20% of the total increase in risk, then the claimant was awarded damages at 20% of the total loss that he is reckoned to have suffered as a result of the mesothelioma. This meant that if the claimant wanted to be compensated for his full loss, he had to separately sue all tortfeasors. Section 3 effectively reversed the House of Lords decision in Barker by making all tortfeasors jointly and severally liable for the mesothelioma so that a claimant can recover compensatory damages for their full loss from any individual tortfeasor that materially increased the risk of mesothelioma. If a claimant does so, then the sued tortfeasor has the right to claim a contribution from any and all other tortfeasors that also materially increased that risk, proportionate to the extent by which each tortfeasor increased that risk. To illustrate, if X gets mesothelioma from exposure at work, and he has worked for companies A Ltd., B Ltd., and C Ltd., each of which materially increased the risk of mesothelioma occurring in him, then X can choose any of the companies to sue. Suppose X sues C Ltd., then the court will award to X, and order C Ltd. to pay, damages totalling compensation for all of the loss he has suffered due to mesothelioma (i.e. 100%). Thereafter, C Ltd. can bring proceedings against A Ltd. and B Ltd., demanding from each a payment of a proportion of the total damages C was ordered to pay to X, corresponding to the proportion by which each company increased the risk of mesothelioma of the total increase in risk in X. Further, section 3 is \\"treated as having always had effect\\" (s.16(3)) and also extends to Scotland and Northern Ireland (s.17). Claims management companies Part 2 of the Act seeks to regulate the provision of claims management services. As of 23 April 2007, an individual or a corporation may not provide claims management services by way of business unless authorised, exempt or otherwise in receipt of a waiver (s.4(1)).The Compensation Act 2006 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2007 (SI 2007/922) The Act creates a Claims Management Services Regulator to authorise and regulate claims management companies and to (s.5): *Set and monitor standards of competence and professional conduct; *Promote good practice, in particular as to the provision of information about charges and other matters to users; *Promote practices likely to facilitate competition; *Ensure that arrangements are made for the protection of users, including complaints handling. It is a crime for an unauthorised person to provide or offer claims management services, or to pretend to be authorised. Offenders are punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale or 51 weeks' imprisonment. If convicted on indictment in the Crown Court, offenders can be sentenced to an unlimited fine or two years' imprisonment (ss.7 and 11). Where a corporate crime is committed, the offender can only be fined and not imprisoned. The Regulator may investigate unauthorised trading and seek an injunction to prevent it or bring a criminal prosecution (s.8). It is a crime to obstruct the Regulator, punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale (s.10). Section 12 creates a Claims Management Services Tribunal to which a person may appeal a decision of the Regulator about authorisation (s.13(1)). There is a further route of appeal to the Court of Appeal (s.13(4)). The Regulator may also refer complaints or questions about the professional conduct of a claims management company to the Tribunal (s.13(2)). Part 2 came progressively into force from 1 December 2006. , only section 13(2) (referrals to the Tribunal by the Regulator) remains to be brought into force.

History RAF Fighter Command use RAF Bottisham opened in March 1940 and was first used by bomb-armed de Havilland Tiger Moths transferred from No. 22 Elementary Flying Training School RAF (EFTS) to be prepared for possible anti-invasion duties. Then beginning in October 1940, the airfield was used by 22 EFTS Tiger Moths as an Relief Landing Ground until mid-1941. With the departure of the Tiger Moths, Bottisham was transferred to 241 Sqn Army Co-operation Command with Westland Lysanders, Curtiss Tomahawks, North American Mustang Mk 1's, moved to Ayr. From 15 June 1942, the airfield was used by No. 652 Squadron RAF and No. 168 Squadron RAF. A number of other Royal Air Force squadrons used the airfield before it was turned over to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF): * No. 2 Squadron RAF between 31 January 1943 and 19 March 1943 with detachments at RAF Westcott, RAF Newmarket, RAF Cranfield, RAF Duxford using the Mustang I. The squadron then moved to RAF Fowlmere. * No. 4 Squadron RAF between 20 March 1943 and 16 July 1943 using the Tomahawk IIA and Mustang I. The squadron then moved to RAF Gravesend. * No. 169 Squadron RAF between 10 March 1943 and 12 March 1943 with the Mustang I before moving to RAF Duxford. * No. 268 Squadron RAF between 6 March 1943 and 10 March 1943 with the Mustang I. The squadron then moved to RAF Snailwell. * No. 288 Squadron RAF between 18 January 1943 and March 1943 as a detachment from RAF Digby. The squadron used the Hawker Hurricane I, Boulton Paul Defiant I and Supermarine Spitfire Mk's VB and IX. The squadron then moved to RAF Coleby Grange. * No. 400 Army Co- Operation Squadron between 18 June 1941 and 25 June 1941. The squadron used the Westland Lysander III and the Tomahawk Mk's I, IIA and IIB. The squadron then moved to RAF Odiham. * No. 613 Squadron RAF between 7 March 1943 and 19 March 1943 with Mustang I before moving to RAF Ringway. * No. 654 Squadron RAF between 20 November 1942 and 20 February 1943 moving to Gourock. The squadron used the Taylorcraft Plus C.2 and the Taylorcraft Auster Mk's I and III. * No. 4 Flying Instructors School (Supplementary) RAF. * No. 2761 Squadron RAF Regiment. * RAF (Belgian) Training School. United States Army Air Forces use With the arrival of large numbers of USAAF fighter groups in 1943, Bottisham was allocated to the Americans and assigned designation as Station 374 (IM). The airfield was enlarged and areas of steel matting were laid. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Bottisham were: * 50th Service Group (VIII Air Force Service Command) : 468th and 469th Services Squadrons; HHS 50th Service Group * 18th Weather Squadron * 66th Station Complement Squadron * 1073rd Quartermaster Company * 1097th Signal Company * 1184th Military Police Company * 1598th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 2118th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon 361st Fighter Group P-47D-11-RE Thunderbolt aircraft Serial 42-75452 of the 374th Fighter Squadron, 361st Fighter Group, based at Bottisham Airfield, England. P-51 Mustangs, including (E9-S, serial number 42-106707) nicknamed \\"Sleepytime Gal\\", (B7-E, serial number 42-106839) nicknamed \\"Bald Eagle III\\" and (E9-K) nicknamed \\"Vi\\" opf the 361st Fighter Group line up for take off on D-Day at Bottisham. \\"The Bottisham Four\\", four USAAF North American P-51 Mustang fighters from the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st Fighter Group, from RAF Bottisham, Cambridgeshire (UK), in flight on 26 July 1944. All four aircraft were lost or crashed by the end of the war in Europe. The airfield was first used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 361st Fighter Group, arriving from Richmond AAF, Virginia on 30 November 1943. The group was under the command of the 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group were identified by yellow around their cowlings and tails. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 374th Fighter Squadron (B7) * 375th Fighter Squadron (E2) * 376th Fighter Squadron (E9) The 361st FG entered combat with Republic P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft on 21 January 1944 and converted to North American P-51 Mustang's in May 1944. The unit served primarily as an escort organisation, covering the penetration, attack, and withdrawal of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress/Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber formations that the USAAF sent against targets on the Continent. The group also engaged in counter-air patrols, fighter sweeps, and strafing and dive-bombing missions. It attacked such targets as airdromes, marshaling yards, missile sites, industrial areas, ordnance depots, oil refineries, trains, and highways. It participated in the assault against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20‚Äì25 February 1944; the Normandy invasion, June 1944 and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. The weight of the heavy P-47 fighters soon began to tell on the wet surface making take-offs tricky. A team of American engineers were called in during January 1944 and, in three days, they constructed a 1,470-yard-long runway with pierced-steel planking. This feat was considered a record for laying this type of prefabricated surfacing. The runway, which was aligned NE-SW, became the main at Bottisham the other also being constructed of PSP. In September 1944 the 361st FG moved to RAF Little Walden when it became available after the departure of the 409th Bombardment Group (Light) for France. Little Walden was a Class A airfield with concrete runways and much better facilities than were available at Bottisham. Post-war use From mid-1945 until 5 January 1946 Bottisham was used temporarily by Belgian airmen until being closed. Today, few traces of Bottisham remain as the land has all been reclaimed for farming, however a few buildings remain in use. The outline of the PSP runway can still be seen, but now as a long thick row of trees. Also the track which intersected the PSP runway towards the SW end is now a permanent Road which cuts through this row of trees. There is now a volunteer run museum at the former site, in honour of the RAF and USAF who were stationed there during the war.  Bottisham Airfield Museum  The Museum opened in 2009 and is the only UK museum dedicated to the Royal Air Force, United States 8th Army Air Force and Belgian Air Forces. They are operating out of the last remaining airfield buildings to exist within the airfield's original perimeter. The purchase of the site was completed in September 2014 and, since then, they have been renovating the airfield buildings and restoring them back to original appearance. A new Nissen hut has been installed in the original position where one was located in 1944. See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations References Citations Bibliography * Freeman, Roger A.

The class is also known as the \\"1500-ton class\\" and were termed in French de grande patrouille. She was named after Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca. Launched in 1935, she entered service in 1936. She escaped from Toulon during the scuttling of the fleet there on 27 November 1942, and continued in service with the Allied forces. Casabianca, commanded by Capitaine de fr√©gate Jean l'Herminier, had a role in the liberation of Corsica, and was an important link between occupied France and the Free French government based in Algiers. Casabianca was one of only five of the 31 Redoutable-class submarines to survive the Second World War.  Service  It was initially planned to name the submarine Casablanca. Navy Minister Fran√ßois Pi√©tri, who was Corsican, instead pressed for a navy vessel to be named in honour of Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, a naval officer from Corsica who had served in the French Revolutionary Wars. The Casablanca was therefore renamed Casabianca prior to being launched. In December 1939 Casabianca escorted . Casabianca was in port at Toulon in November 1942 when the Germans enacted Case Anton, the annexation of the area of France previously controlled by the Vichy government. On 27 November 1942 German forces attempted to take over the fleet at Toulon, leading its commanders to order the ships to be scuttled to keep them out of German hands. Capitaine de corvette Jean L'Herminier, commander of Casabianca, instead took his submarine out to sea and escaped to Algiers to join the Allies. The submarine was attacked by German aircraft during the voyage, and was shadowed by a Royal Navy destroyer. Five other French submarines escaped from Toulon, two of which, and Marsouin, served like Casabianca with the allies. Casabianca in her original form, prior to modernization in the United States. After arriving in Algiers, Casabianca passed under the orders of Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, until his assassination on 24 December 1942. Casabianca was then under G√©n√©ral Henri Giraud, until Giraud's replacement by Charles de Gaulle. Casabiancas participation in operations around Corsica was one of the factors that led to Giraud's removal from office. She served mainly on intelligence gathering missions, supplying arms and delivering men to support the Corsican Maquisards. She played an important role in the eventual liberation of the island in September 1943.Plaquette concernant le 40eanniversaire de la lib√©ration de la Corse. Her elusiveness earned her the nickname \\"Ghost Submarine\\" from the Germans. The British conservative MP Keith Monin Stainton served as a liaison officer aboard the submarine in 1943, whilst a Royal Navy lieutenant. From 1943 until 1944 Charles William Beattie, a Royal Navy Signals specialist, also served on board Casabianca to safeguard and interpret secret cyphers sent to the boat whilst out on station. He took part in many of the secret landings on the Corsican coast. In her last mission, Casabianca landed 109 special forces men, a record for a submarine of her size. The men were landed on an isolated beach at Arone, near the village of Piana, in the north west of Corsica, where a monument now exists. After the liberation of Corsica, the Casabianca was used for regular patrols. In 1944 she was hit in a friendly fire accident by a British plane, and had to refit in Philadelphia until March 1945. In common with other Redoutable-class submarines modernized in the United States, the original conning tower was considerably modified. Two radars were installed, as was a platform on the front to carry a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun. The submarine was scrapped in 1956, but the conning tower survives -- it has been on display in Bastia near the harbour since 2004. The two periscopes and the deck gun are visible, however the conning tower was truncated from the rear, where a second 20mm gun was replaced by a 13.2 double machine gun of French origins. During her career Casabianca sank one warship with a torpedo and another with her deck gun, sank a merchant vessel, carried out seven secret missions, assisted in the liberation of Corsica, and ran the German blockade of Toulon during her defection to the allies. Cited 7 times out of which 6 at the orders of the navy , Casabianca was decorated with the Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945 and was awarded the Red Fourragere of the L√©gion d'honneur.  Namesakes  An anti- submarine escorteur was named Casabianca from 1957 until 1984. The Rubis-class nuclear submarine Casabianca is named after the Second World War submarine.  Casabianca in popular culture  The submarine's exploits were used as the basis for the 1951 film , starring Pierre Dudan and Jean Vilar. The Casabianca also appears in the 2007 novel The Double Agents by W. E. B. Griffin, book five of the Men at War series.

The planet has been identified in 2011 as the darkest known exoplanet, reflecting less than 1% of any light that hits it. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a bulk composition similar to that of Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, but similar to many planets detected around other stars, TrES-2b is located very close to its star, and belongs to the class of planets known as hot Jupiters. This system was within the field of view of the Kepler spacecraft. This planet continues to be studied by other projects and the parameters are being improved continuously. A 2007 study improved stellar and planetary parameters. A 2008 study concluded that the TrES-2 system is a binary star system. This has a significant effect on the values for the stellar and the planetary parameters. Discovery The radial velocity of GSC 03549‚Äì02811 over time, caused by the presence of TrES-2 b. TrES-2b was discovered on August 21, 2006 by the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES) by detecting the transit of the planet across its parent star using Sleuth (Palomar Observatory, California) and PSST (Lowell Observatory, Arizona), part of the TrES network of 10‚Äìcm telescopes. The discovery was confirmed by the W. M. Keck Observatory on September 8, 2006, by measuring the radial velocity of the star that hosts TrES-2b. Spin-orbit angle In August 2008 more details of the relationship between the parent star and the orbit of the planet were published. The orbit was determined to be tilted by ‚àí from the stellar equator. The orbital direction was determined to be in the same direction as the star's rotation (prograde). The Kepler mission NASA launched Kepler in March 2009. The spacecraft is dedicated to the discovery of extrasolar planets by the transit method from solar orbit. In April 2009 the project released the first light images from the spacecraft, and TrES-2b was one of two objects highlighted in these images. Although TrES-2b is not the only known exoplanet in the field of view of this spacecraft it is the only one identified in the first light images. This object is important for calibration and check-out. The GSC 03549-02811 system as seen from the Kepler spacecraft. (Celestial north is toward the lower left corner and the subject is in the center of the photograph as seen clearly in enlarged view.) The Kepler mission also managed to detect the mass of the planet from Kepler data alone through the analysis of the light curve of the host star. In addition to detecting the planet directly, the planet was also detected by analysis of the star brightness caused by the gravitational tug of TrES-2b by shape distortion of the host star and by light variations due to Doppler beaming.Photometrically derived masses and radii of the planet and star in the TrES-2 system: Thomas Barclay, Daniel Huber, Jason F. Rowe, Jonathan J. Fortney, Caroline V. Morley, Elisa V. Quintana, Daniel C. Fabrycky, Geert Barentsen, Steven Bloemen, Jessie L. Christiansen, Brice-Olivier Demory, Benjamin J. Fulton, Jon M. Jenkins, Fergal Mullally, Darin Ragozzine, Shaun E. Seader, Avi Shporer, Peter Tenenbaum, Susan E. Thompson Physical characteristics Albedo An artist's impression of TrES-2bThe first important result from the Kepler Mission about TrES-2b is an extremely low geometric albedo measured in 2011, making it the darkest known exoplanet. If the entire day‚Äìnight contrast were due to geometric albedo, it would be 2.53%, but modeling suggests that much of this is dayside emission and the true albedo is much lower. It is estimated to be less than 1% and for best-fit model it is about 0.04%. This makes TrES-2b the darkest known exoplanet, reflecting less light than coal or black acrylic paint. It is not clear why the planet is so dark. One reason could be an absence of reflective clouds such as those which make Jupiter so bright, due to TrES-2b's proximity to its parent star and the consequent high temperature. Another reason could be the presence in the atmosphere of light-absorbing chemicals such as vaporized sodium, potassium, or gaseous titanium oxide; however, Kipping and Spiegel excluded heavy oxides of titanium and vanadium from their models, as it seems unrealistic that condensed, heavy compounds be present in the upper atmosphere. They also note that in general, hot Jupiters are expected to be dark, because \\"absorption due to the broad wings of the sodium and potassium D lines is thought to dominate their visible spectra\\", and, apart from that of Kepler-7b (), albedo measurements for hot Jupiters have generally given only upper limits. Temperature The planet is likely to be tidally locked to the parent star. In 2015, the planetary nightside temperature was estimated to be equal to 1885 K.A Comprehensive Study of Kepler Phase Curves and Secondary Eclipses:Temperatures and Albedos of Confirmed Kepler Giant Planets References External links *Host to 'Hot Jupiter' (labeled) NASA, 2009-04-16 * TrES-2: Most Massive Nearby Transiting Exoplanet * Jupiter-Sized Transiting Planet Found by Astronomers Using Novel Telescope Network * Light curve for TrES-2b using differential photometry Category:Draco (constellation) Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2006 Category:Exoplanets Category:Giant planets Category:Hot Jupiters Category:Transiting exoplanets ","title":"TrES-2b"},{"id":"6898818","text":"Kristoffer Lou Gonzales Agoncillo (born April 10, 1979), is a Filipino actor, model, singer, photographer, and TV host.

The palace complex lies in the centre of Kathmandu, to the north of the Babar Mahal and Thapathali Durbar and east of Bhadrakali Temple. This palace was built by Chandra Shumsher JBR in June 1908. The palace used to be one of the most exquisite and lavish of palaces in the world until the 1950s. Today it houses buildings of the Nepali Government, including the Pratinidhi Sabha, the Rastriya Sabha and several ministries. History Singha Durbar was built by Shumsher immediately after accession to the post of Prime Minister. It was initially a small private residence but grew bigger during the construction. Immediately after construction, Shumsher sold this property to the Government of Nepal for 20 million Nepali rupees as the official residence of Prime minister. After his death in 1929, it was used as the official residence of prime ministers of Rana dynasty except Padma Shumsher JBR, who lived in his own Bishalnagar Durbar. The last Rana Prime minister to occupy Singha Durbar was Mohan Shumsher JBR. Even after the fall of Rana Dynasty in 1951, Mohan used this place, but in 1953 he was ordered by His Majesty's Government to leave the palace which became National Property. Under Government of Nepal Main Gate of Singha Durbar After the end of the hereditary Prime Minister system (Ranas), the Government of Nepal used this palace compound to house government offices. The palace compound is occupied by both chambers of the Parliament of Nepal (the Pratinidhi Sabha, or House of Representatives, and the Rashtriya Sabha, or House of the States). It holds 20 ministries and government offices. Singh Durbar is also the headquarters of Radio Nepal and Nepal Television. Shingha Durbar Design Exterior structure The structure was designed by Kumar Narsingh Rana, Kishor Narsingh Rana. The architecture of the palace is a unique example of merging building traditions, including Palladian, Corinthian, Neoclassical mansions along with Baroque architecture. Interior space Before the fire of 1973, Singha Durbar had 7 courtyards and 1700 rooms with marbled floor, painted ceilings, silver furniture and expanses of crystal lighting.http://www.thetaranights.com/singha-durbar/ State Hall  View of the Durbar from the gardens The State Hall is the largest and the most decorated room in this palace. This hall is adorned with foreign imported art pieces like Murano glass crystal chandeliers, Belgian mirrors along with English stained glass doors and Italian marble floors with floral patterns in walls and ceilings.  Gallery Baithak  Juddha Shumsher built Gallery Baithak to meet foreign dignitaries. During that time, ambassadors from friendly countries used to present their credence at the Human Dhoka. Later the Gallery Baithak was used as the parliament building. Disasters Fire of 1973 On Monday, 9 July 1973, a huge fire broke out in Singha Durbar engulfing all three wings of the palace except the front facing wing . To prevent the front wing from catching fire, cannon destroyed three wings facing North, South and West. After the fire was put out, the whole area was rebuilt on the old foundation. Earthquake of 2015 Singha Durbar was seriously damaged during the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. http://nepalitimes.com/blogs/mycity/2015/05/20/rana-palaces-after-the- earthquake/ See also *Babar Mahal *Thapathali Durbar *Rana palaces of Nepal References Category:Rana palaces of Nepal Category:Buildings and structures in Kathmandu Category:Government of Nepal Category:Prime ministerial residences Category:Tourist attractions in Kathmandu ","title":"Singha Durbar"},{"id":"6898826","text":"Josef Adolf (14 May 1898 in Velk√° √öpa (Pec pod Snƒõ≈ækou), Austria-Hungary - 1951 in Viechtach, Germany) was an Ethnic German Nordic combined skier who competed for Czechoslovakia in the 1920s.

The dead included three Cherokee on the defendant's side, including his attorney and a brother; a US Deputy Marshal and four members of his federal posse, plus three relatives of the Cherokee murder victim. Another ten men were wounded, including both Cherokee and white men. Ezekial \\"Zeke\\" Proctor (Cherokee) was being tried for fatally shooting Polly Beck (Cherokee) and wounding her husband Jim Kesterson, who was white. The trial was highly charged for both personal and political reasons. First, there were strong family ties between the accused and victims. Secondly, the Cherokee and the United States had a jurisdictional dispute over prosecution of the shooting of Kesterton, because he was a white man. The United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas had limited jurisdiction in Indian Territory. Because Kesterson was white, the US District Court said it had jurisdiction to prosecute Proctor for his attack on the non-Native, although the incident occurred within the Cherokee Nation. It had jurisdiction over non-Native federal crimes in Indian Territory, and all federal crimes in western Arkansas. The US District Court had assigned two Deputy US Marshals to lead an eight-man federal posse to attend the trial. Five Beck clan members accompanied them. The posse members included two regulars and six newly appointed white men from Fort Smith. If Proctor was acquitted by the Cherokee court, the US Deputy Marshals were ordered to arrest him on federal charges in the attack on Kesterton and bring him back to Fort Smith for trial.Ernst, Deadly Affrays But, shooting broke out in the crowded courtroom during the proceedings: one of the US Deputy Marshals and seven men associated with him (including three Beck clan); and three Cherokee citizens were killed in the m√©le√©, including the defendant's attorney and the defendant's brother. Another ten men were wounded. The incident has also been called the Goingsnake Tragedy,Fourkiller, Nick and Wendell Cochran. 1983. Historic Sites of the Cherokee Nation. Tahlequah, OK: Cross Cultural Education Center. p 61. the Cherokee Courthouse ShootoutSmith, Robert Barr. 2004. \\"Blood Bath at Going Snake: The Cherokee Courtroom Shootout.\\" Wild West (via Historynet) and the Proctor-Beck Fight. Background During the Civil War, Ezekiel \\"Zeke\\" Proctor, a Cherokee who had removed from Georgia, fought for the Union Army. All of the Beck family men, also Cherokee, fought for the Confederate Army. Most of the Cherokee Nation was allied with the Confederacy; many of its members were slaveholders, and the Confederate representatives had promised the Cherokee and other Native Americans an Indian state if they were victorious in the war. Following the war, tensions between the Proctors and the Becks were high; due mostly to the wartime loyalties, but also to Proctor's alleged romantic interest in Polly Beck. Proctor was a member of the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society, which strongly believed in the preservation of traditional ways, and was trying to resist European-American encroachment on land and culture. These members disapproved of Cherokee women being involved romantically with white men. In 1872 Proctor thought Polly Beck should not be in a relationship with a white man; she had been widowed in an earlier marriage to a Cherokee. Both Proctor and Beck had white fathers themselves, but identified as Cherokee. Proctor's father was a known murderer. The Union veteran was described as often drunk. He once forced his way into a house where a young girl had been playing the piano; after she stopped, he held her at gunpoint and made her continue playing. He was involved in several saloon brawls in the small town of Cincinnati, Arkansas, but he was also known for taking responsibility and returning afterward to pay for damages. He was said to have previously killed two Cherokee brothers from the Jaybird family . Polly Beck was described as an attractive woman of mixed race. She was the widow of Steven Hilderbrand (Cherokee), who had been killed during the Civil War. She remarried several times after his death. Jim Kesterson (or Chesterson),Federal Writers' Project 257 who was white, was either her fourth or fifth husband. Polly had one brother and two first cousins who worked with the Deputy US Marshals based at Fort Smith, the site of the US District Court for Western Arkansas and Indian Territory. Massacre The United States Marshals and the Cherokee Nation have differing accounts of what contributed to the shootout in the court. Over time, other versions of the initial incident have surfaced, but all tend to indicate three facts: *1. The murder suspect, Zeke Proctor, was known to object to Cherokee women being involved with white men. *2. Jim Kesterson, a white man, had once been married to Proctor's sister, and was now married to Polly Beck. *3. Proctor had a romantic interest in Polly Beck. Delaware County. This 1933 photograph shows the structure built around 1900 to replace the original mill where the shootings occurred. Some versions say that Jim Kesterson had previously been involved with Proctor's sister, Susan, and had left her for Polly. Susan and the children were left destitute (it is said the children were not Kesterson's). Another version says that Kesterson caught Proctor stealing cattle and intended to prosecute. Yet another version claims Proctor had been previously involved romantically with Polly, who was known locally to have dated several men, most of them white. He was said to be in love with her. Another version says that Proctor had never been involved with Polly, but opposed any Cherokee women marrying or being involved with a white man. Proctor is known to have confronted Polly and Jim on February 27 at her late husband's mill in the Oklahoma Territory. They argued and Proctor shot Kesterson in the head with a rifle, slightly wounding him. Proctor also shot Polly, killing her. Proctor said that he had accidentally killed her. Stories diverge here, but one version says Proctor surrendered himself after the murder of Polly to the sheriff of the Goingsnake District of the Cherokee Nation. Cherokee judge Blackhawk Sixkiller was appointed to the case.Federal Writers' Project 258 Chesterson, believing Proctor would not be convicted in a Cherokee court, appealed to the regional federal district court, asking that an arrest warrant be issued to ensure that Proctor received a trial in a non- Cherokee court in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Treaties with the United States federal government said that Cherokee Nation courts would have jurisdiction over Cherokee people. The prospect of non-tribal law officers being involved in the case was considered a threat to tribal sovereignty and was deeply resented by the Cherokee people. The federal court dispatched a ten-member posse including two Deputy US Marshals to secure the arrest of Proctor at the court house in Tahlequah if he was acquitted by the Cherokee jury. Five members of the Beck clan traveled with this posse. Because of the strong emotions related to the case, the trial was moved to the schoolhouse, seen as easier to defend than the courthouse. All participants of the trial were heavily armed. Without issuing a warning, members of the group with the Deputy US Marshals attacked the schoolhouse. In the ensuing melee, eight of the posse members were killed or mortally wounded and nine Cherokee, including Proctor and the judge, were wounded, several mortally.

Aftermath The Cherokee authorities moved the trial to a different location. The jury acquitted Proctor. District Attorney James Huckleberry dispatched a large posse from Fort Smith under the command of Deputy US Marshal Charles Robinson. They took with them two doctors, who helped tend to Cherokee civilians wounded in the shootout. The second posse arrested several men believed to have been involved in the killing of the marshals, including jury foreman Arch Scaper. The Cherokee did not resist the second posse, but Zeke Proctor had fled by the time it arrived. A federal grand jury in Fort Smith indicted twenty Cherokee who were present at the trial, as well as all the tribal court officers. The Cherokee Nation issued warrants for several Cherokee citizens. The suspects were taken to Fort Smith, Arkansas for trial, but all were eventually released due to lack of evidence or witnesses willing to testify. The federal government later dismissed all indictments. Zeke Proctor returned to live in the area. By the 1880s he owned a small ranch. He was elected as a Cherokee Senator in 1877, and in 1894 was elected sheriff of the Flint District of the Cherokee Nation. He served as a deputy US marshal from 1891 to 1894, under Isaac Parker, who had been in office during the Goingsnake Massacre. Proctor died on February 23, 1907 at age 76. His interment was in West Siloam Springs, Oklahoma's Johnson Cemetery. Notes References *Federal Writers' Project. Oklahoma: A Guide to the Sooner State.

Solutions to the task typically involve aspects of artificial intelligence and statistics, such as data mining and text mining.Yuen-Hsien Tseng, Chun-Yen Chang, Shu-Nu Chang Rundgren, and Carl-Johan Rundgren, \\" Mining Concept Maps from News Stories for Measuring Civic Scientific Literacy in Media\\", Computers and Education, Vol. 55, No. 1, August 2010, pp. 165-177. Because artifacts are typically a loosely structured sequence of words and other symbols (rather than concepts), the problem is nontrivial, but it can provide powerful insights into the meaning, provenance and similarity of documents. Methods Traditionally, the conversion of words to concepts has been performed using a thesaurus,Yuen-Hsien Tseng, \\" Automatic Thesaurus Generation for Chinese Documents\\", Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Vol. 53, No. 13, Nov. 2002, pp. 1130-1138. and for computational techniques the tendency is to do the same. The thesauri used are either specially created for the task, or a pre-existing language model, usually related to Princeton's WordNet. The mappings of words to conceptsYuen-Hsien Tseng, \\" Generic Title Labeling for Clustered Documents\\", Expert Systems With Applications, Vol. 37, No. 3, 15 March 2010, pp. 2247-2254 . are often ambiguous. Typically each word in a given language will relate to several possible concepts. Humans use context to disambiguate the various meanings of a given piece of text, where available machine translation systems cannot easily infer context. For the purposes of concept mining however, these ambiguities tend to be less important than they are with machine translation, for in large documents the ambiguities tend to even out, much as is the case with text mining. There are many techniques for disambiguation that may be used. Examples are linguistic analysis of the text and the use of word and concept association frequency information that may be inferred from large text corpora. Recently, techniques that base on semantic similarity between the possible concepts and the context have appeared and gained interest in the scientific community. Applications Detecting and indexing similar documents in large corpora One of the spin-offs of calculating document statistics in the concept domain, rather than the word domain, is that concepts form natural tree structures based on hypernymy and meronymy. These structures can be used to generate simple tree membership statistics, that can be used to locate any document in a Euclidean concept space. If the size of a document is also considered as another dimension of this space then an extremely efficient indexing system can be created. This technique is currently in commercial use locating similar legal documents in a 2.5 million document corpus. Clustering documents by topic Standard numeric clustering techniques may be used in \\"concept space\\" as described above to locate and index documents by the inferred topic. These are numerically far more efficient than their text mining cousins, and tend to behave more intuitively, in that they map better to the similarity measures a human would generate.

It was celebrated for the first time in 1967. Its aim is to highlight the importance of literacy to individuals, communities and societies. Celebrations take place in several countries.  Rationale  Some 775 million lack minimum literacy skills; one in five adults are still not literate and two-thirds of them are women; 60.7 million children are out-of-school and many more attend irregularly or drop out. According to UNESCO‚Äôs \\"Global Monitoring Report on Education for All (2006)\\", South Asia has the lowest regional adult literacy rate (58.6%), followed by sub-Saharan Africa (59.7%). Countries with the lowest literacy rates in the world are Burkina Faso (12.8%), Niger (14.4%) and Mali (19%). The report shows a clear connection between illiteracy and countries in severe poverty, and between illiteracy and prejudice against women.  Celebrations  Image shared on the Archives New Zealand Flickr account to celebrate International Literacy Day Celebrations of International Literacy Day have included specific themes, in line with Education For All goals and other United Nations programs such as the United Nations Literacy Decade. The celebration's theme for 2007 and 2008 was ‚ÄúLiteracy and Health‚Äù, with prizes awarded to organizations at the forefront of health education. This was also the thematic emphasis of the 2007‚Äì2008 biennium of the United Nations Literacy Decade. In particular, International Literacy Day 2008 had a strong emphasis on Literacy and Epidemics with a focus on communicable diseases such as HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria, some of the world's forefront public health concerns. For 2009‚Äì2010 the emphasis was placed on ‚ÄúLiteracy and Empowerment‚Äù, with special consideration to Gender Equality and the empowerment of women. The theme of the 2011‚Äì2012 celebrations is ‚ÄúLiteracy and Peace‚Äù. The following writers are supporting UNESCO through the Writers for Literacy Initiative: Margaret Atwood, Paul Auster, Philippe Claudel, Paulo Coelho, Philippe Delerm, Fatou Diome, Chahdortt Djavann, Nadine Gordimer, Amitav Ghosh, Marc Levy, Alberto Manguel, Anna Moi, Scott Momaday, Toni Morrison, √ârik Orsenna, Gis√®le Pineau, El Tayeb Salih, Francisco Jose Sionil, Wole Soyinka, Amy Tan, Mikl√≥s V√°mos, Abdourahman Waberi, Wei Wei, Banana Yoshimoto.

Description Amazonian marsh rats are smaller than the common brown rat, but otherwise have a similar appearance. They range from in head-body length, with a tail long, and typically weigh between . They have short fur, which is tawny or buff over the back, becomes paler on the flanks, and fades to white or pale orange on the underparts. The hindfeet are noticeably larger than the forepaws, with prominent claws and partial webbing between the toes. There is also a slight fringe of longer, silvery, hair, around the soles of the feet. Females have eight or ten teats. Distribution and habitat Amazonian marsh rats are found across much of northern South America east of the Andes. They inhabit open areas such as grasslands, savanna, marshes, clearings in the rainforest, and farmland, at elevations up to . Although the exact taxonomic status of some populations is unclear, two subspecies are currently recognised: * Holochilus sciureus sciureus - Central Brazil, southern Colombia, eastern Peru and Ecuador, northern Bolivia * Holochilus sciureus berbicensis - Venezuela, the Guianas, northern Brazil, eastern Colombia Biology and behaviour Amazonian marsh rats feed primarily on grass stems, although they also eat some seeds, and small quantities of sedges, other plants, and even small invertebrates. They are nocturnal, occupying a home range of as little as . Females construct spherical nests made of leaves in order to rear their young. These nests may be on the ground in dense vegetation or cracks in the earth, but are more commonly located above the ground, attached to sturdy stems such as those of sugar cane or rice plants. The inner lining of the nest consists of finely shredded leaves, with a more intact outer shell. Predators include caimans, rattlesnakes, barn owls, hawks, kites, and probably crab-eating foxes. They breed throughout the year, although the fertility of both sexes increases during periods of high rainfall. Courtship lasts around 4 days before mating occurs, and gestation lasts 29 days. The female gives birth at night or at dawn to a litter of up to eight blind, hairless, pups, each measuring around and weighing . The fur begins to appear after five days, and the first teeth emerge at ten days. The young are weaned a fifteen days, by which time their eyes have opened. The rats reach sexual maturity at three to four months, with females maturing more slowly than males.

The PUB regulates and oversees the country's entire water supply system, which comprises the water catchment systems, drainage systems, water works, water reclamation plants and sewage systems. In April 2020, PUB was also appointed Singapore's National Coastal Protection Agency. The nation's demand for water is about a day, with homes and non-domestic sectors consumption forming 45% and 55% of the demand respectively, and expected to double by 2060. PUB is set to meet 80% of this demand through its NEWater and desalination technologies. The PUB's watershed management and treatment processes has ensured a continuous supply of clean and quality water for Singaporeans over the last four decades. The nation's clean and drinkable 'tap water' across the island exceeds the drinking water standards set by the World Health Organization. Singapore is named the top Asian city in water sustainability development in 2015, with the nation boasting the highest drinking water and sanitation standards in the region. History Previous PUB logo used from 2005 to 2016 The PUB is the statutory board of then Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources responsible for acquiring, producing, disseminating and reclaiming water to ensure a sustainable and efficient water supply for Singapore. It is also known as the National Water Agency. During colonial period and up to 1961, the supply of water in Singapore was managed by the Municipal Water Department under the guidance of the Municipal Engineer. Three reservoirs in Singapore are named after notable Municipal Engineers James MacRitchie, Robert Peirce (engineer) and David J. Murnane. The idea of a Public Utilities Board was first introduced in 1961 when industrialisation was driving up the country's demand for power. However, it was only until 1 May 1963 that the statutory board came into force. Prior to its reconstitution as the National Water Agency on 1 April 2001, the PUB was previously under the Ministry of Trade and Industry where it facilitated the supply of electricity, water and gas in Singapore. Today, the PUB is solely in charge of water supplies with the management and control of electricity and gas transferred to the Energy Market Authority (EMA). In 2003 and 2005, the PUB launched the NEWater project and the desalinated water treatment project respectively. This further diversifies the water supply in Singapore to four main sources: local catchment water, imported water, NEWater and desalinated water. They form the Four National Taps. Operations Singapore faces a problem of water shortage with its limited rainfall and land area. Long-term water security has been one of the key priorities of the government of Singapore. As the national water agency, PUB takes control of the entire water chain. From the collection of rainwater to water reclamation, the four main processes involved are collection, production, distribution and reclamation. In the collection process, rainwater is collected through a network of rivers, drains and canals and stored in the reservoirs before undergoing treatment for drinking water purposes. The reservoirs are equipped with pipelines that interlink the collection ponds to manage excess water by controlling the water level in each reservoir. In 2011, rainwater can be collected on two-thirds of Singapore's land surface. In the production process, raw water from the reservoirs is piped to the waterworks to be treated with chemical coagulation, rapid gravity filtration and chlorine disinfection. These procedures remove harmful particles and suspended particulate matters from the raw water, making them safe for consumption. The filtered water is stored in water tanks for water quality checks before being distributed to the people. Used water is collected through a sewerage system and recycled via water reclamation plants in the reclamation process. The water is purified using the NEWater technology. With the development of the deep tunnel sewerage system (DTSS) aimed for completion in 2022, sewage will be conveniently transported to the three existing water reclamation plants for treatment. Four National Taps Compelled for the need for self-reliance and sustainability, PUB has invested and developed a dynamic, efficient and sustainable water supply system stemming from four different sources, also known as the Four National Taps. The Four National Taps form the backbone of PUB's, and in turn Singapore's, water management strategy. Local catchment water Singapore's rainwater is collected and stored in 17 reservoirs using an extensive network of drains, rivers and canals. The 17 reservoirs for rainwater collection are Pandan Reservoir, Kranji Reservoir, Jurong Lake, MacRitchie Reservoir, Upper Peirce Reservoir, Lower Peirce Reservoir, Bedok Reservoir, Upper Seletar Reservoir , Lower Seletar Reservoir, Poyan Reservoir, Murai Reservoir, Tengeh Reservoir, Sarimbun Reservoir, Pulau Tekong Reservoir, Marina Reservoir, Serangoon Reservoir and Punggol Reservoir. PUB makes use of online sensors and sampling methods to monitor the quality of raw water it is treating. Imported water Singapore currently imports nearly 40 percent of its 300-million-gallon daily demand from its neighbor, Malaysia, through the Johor-Singapore Causeway water pipes. In 2061, the remaining contracts between both countries will expire. To lessen its reliance on Malaysia, Singapore introduced new ways of water sources to meet Singapore's demand for water. By diversifying Singapore' s water supply, Singapore was successful in building up a robust water system. NEWater NEWater is a term invented by PUB. It is a high-quality reclaimed water which is purified using advanced membrane and ultraviolet technologies. It is scientifically tested to have surpassed the World Health Organization's requirements for safe drinking water. By 2020, NEWater is expected to meet 40% of Singapore's need and demand for water. Despite NEWater tested safe for portable use, Singapore authority decided to blend NEWater with raw reservoir water so that it will undergo the same conventional water treatment process. The process would re-introduce trace minerals that had been removed during the production of NEWater and provide additional safety precaution beyond the advanced technologies used to produce NEWater. Desalinated water Desalinated water is Singapore's fourth National Tap. It was first introduced in September 2005, with the first SingSpring Desalination Plant located in Tuas. The plant can produce 30 million gallons of water a day (136, 000 cubic meters) and is one of the region's largest seawater reverse-osmosis plants. During pretreatment process, suspended particles in the sea water is removed. The water then undergoes reverse osmosis; the same technology used in the production of NEWater. The pure desalinated water is then blended with treated water before it is supplied to homes and industries. Today, with the addition of a second and larger desalination plant known as the Tuaspring Desalination Plant, desalinated water can meet up to 25% of Singapore's current water demand. Outstanding Initiatives Water Wally Launched and unveiled on 4 August 2005, Water Wally is the official mascot for PUB. Through a lively and interactive approach, Water Wally aims to educate the public about water preservation and sustainable usage. PUB has embarked on several initiatives involving Water Wally, leveraging on its appeal to reach out to the general public and more specifically, schools. My Take on Water ‚ÄúMy Take on Water\\" was a photo / video competition organised by PUB in 2013 in lieu of its 50th anniversary. This event was held over a period of 5 months in conjunction with the World Water Day celebration. With a top prize of $5,000, the competition served to incentivise the public to share and reminisce the positive impacts water has on their lives. PUB hoped to reinforce to the public the privileges of having readily clean water available for use and prompt them in cherishing and appreciating Singapore's water. Shower Dance The shower dance is an initiative targeted at primary schools. By 2013, Water Wally had visited and imparted the dance moves to 185 primary schools. By leveraging on the appeal of mascot Water Wally, PUB was able to garner the interest and support of primary school students. These students were tasked to monitor and record their shower timings in an activity booklet issued to them. They were also given the chance to influence and educate their parents and neighbours regarding water conservation. Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters programme The ABC programme is a long term initiative started in 2006, targeted at transforming Singapore's water bodies into beautiful and iconic symbols of Singapore's water landscapes. It strives to beautify and bring Singaporeans in closer proximity to water such that they will better appreciate and cherish water as a scarce resource. In the development of this programme, PUB seeks the collaboration and advice from the 3P sectors of public, privately held company and people to help them in building a firm relationship with water and develop a joint responsibility for it. PUB also plans to utilize this channel to create awareness of the concept and application of its programmes amongst industry experts in hope to attract and train professionals to design and implement this project. Thus far, PUB has identified more than 100 potential development regions with 27 already in progress. PUB's extensive and lucrative proposal has won Singapore the Utility Performance Initiative of the Year at the Global Water Awards 2013 presented at the Global Water Summit in Seville, Spain. Water efficiency management plan Introduced in 2010, the Water Efficiency Management Plan (WEMP) is an initiative introduced by PUB to aid businesses in the efficient management of water usage. It primarily serves to provide a clear breakdown of water usage, identify potential areas for improvement and draft a strategy to improve business operational processes. From 2015, bulk consumers of water, with businesses using more than 60000 cubic metres of water, will be required to install water meters to monitor water usage. These businesses will also have to submit their WEMP to PUB annually for the next 3 years to ensure adherence to requirement. Corporate social responsibility Apart from ensuring an efficient and sustainable water management network, PUB also integrates the values of giving and sharing into its business practices and philosophy. PUB advocates being responsible and caring toward both society and the environment, exemplified through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework. Corporate philanthropy PUB has been awarded the highest honour Pinnacle Award in 2007 in recognition for its loyal and continued commitment to Community Chest. PUB's employees have been supporting the virtue of corporate philanthropy by consistently and steadily contributing to the Share Programme under the Community Chest since 1986. PUB also actively contributes to the Vertical Challenge, an annual fundraising event jointly organised by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and PUB. Through passionate participation and benevolent monetary contributions, PUB advocates the spirit and virtue of giving by playing their part in raising funds for beneficiaries of the events. Community volunteering PUB also engages in the spirit of volunteering, by collaborating with Community Development Councils (CDCs) and volunteers. PUB educates disadvantaged families on water saving habits and installs water efficient gadgets in the homes of these families to aid them in this cause. This initiative has greatly helped in reducing the utility usage by these families. PUB also centralizes its volunteering approach on the importance of building relationships. Throughout 2004 to 2007, PUB has collaborated with foundations like the Singapore Children's Society and the Peace Connect Neighbourhood Link in activities like home visits, distributing rations and organizing outings for children. Responsible business practices PUB adopts a dual faceted approach in its corporate operations and daily activities, believing in responsibility to the environment and its owners. PUB's responsibility toward environmental conservation through its green office practices has allowed for substantial and efficient conservation of resources, thereby winning the Green Office Label in 2007 awarded by the Singapore Environment Council. PUB has also devised the OHSAS 18801 Occupational Health and Safety Management System centric around health, safety, security and emergency risks and managements. Through this, PUB puts in place plans to tackle and mitigate potential health and safety hazards that might affect their employees. International responsibility PUB takes on a holistic responsibility towards safe and efficient water management. PUB, having a successful and professional management system, is keen to share and promotes safe techniques of managing drinking water to other key global players to expand its reach and influence globally. It frequently organises study excursions and seminars to promote its professional water management strategies with world-renowned organisations such as UNESCO, UNEP, UN-HABITAT, Asian Development Bank and World Bank. PUB also offers its Waterhub as the Asia Pacific Regional Knowledge Hub for open- sharing of management strategies and facilities to developing countries.  Unions  Employees of Public Utilities Board are represented by the Public Utilities Board Employees' Union, a House Union affiliated to the National Trades Union Congress.

Smith: Walter Bryan Emery, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol.57 (1971), pp.190-201 was a British Egyptologist. His career was devoted to the excavation of archaeological sites along the Nile Valley.Archaic Egypt (bio), Walter B. Emery, Pelican Books, London, 1963. During the Second World War, he served with distinction as an officer in the British Army and, in the immediate aftermath, in the Diplomatic Service, both still in Egypt. Early life Walter Bryan Emery was born in Liverpool in England, the son of Walter Thomas Emery - the head of a technical college - and Beatrice Mary Emery.http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/people/walter-bryan-emery Emery was educated at St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool. On leaving school, he was briefly apprenticed to a firm of marine engineers. His training there resulted in his becoming an excellent draftsman, a skill which produced the brilliantly-executed line drawings that permeated his later published works on Egyptology, and which was similarly influential in his wartime military career. Field archaeologist Nubian king who ruled between the collapse of the Meroitic dynasty in 350 or 400 AD and the founding of the Christian kingdom of Nubia in 600 AD. Found in Tomb 118 at Ballana in Lower Nubia by Emery. After preliminary training at the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology, Emery made his first trip to Egypt as an assistant on the staff of the Egypt Exploration Society, in 1923. There he participated in the excavation of Amarna, the ancient city in Middle Egypt founded by the pharaoh Akhenaton. By 1924, he was already field director of Sir Robert Mond's excavations at Thebes for the University of Liverpool. He made several clearings, restorations and protective operations into a score of tombs at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna. Between 1924 and 1928, continuing as Director of the Mond Expedition, he worked on excavations at Nubia, Luxor and Thebes. In 1929 he was appointed field director of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia under the auspices of the Egyptian Government Service of Antiquities, with authority to explore and excavate all ancient sites in Nubia which were soon to be flooded after the erection of the Aswan Low Dam. Working at Quban, Ballana and Qustul, he excavated the X-Group of tombs dating to the 3rd to 6th century A.D. He was assisted in his work by his wife, Molly. The completion of the excavations of the fortress at Buhen ended his work in Nubia. He then became director of fieldwork at Luxor and Armant. During the years 1935 to 1939 he was the director of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia. During these years as director, Emery also investigated several early dynastic tombs at Saqqara. While at Saqqara he made the significant discovery of a \\"zoo\\" of mummified animal remains. In 1937, Emery also \\"discovered\\" a disc-shaped object, it is referred to as the Schist Disc (aka the Egyptian Tri-Lobed Disc) while excavating the burial chamber of the Tomb of Prince Sabu, son of Adjuib Pharaoh, governor of the I Dynasty (3,000 B.C.). The object has been on display to the public on the first floor of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, labelled as Vase of schist. War service Emery was commissioned as an Army officer immediately on the outbreak of war, on 12 September 1939https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34766/supplement/74/data.pdf. There was no Intelligence Corps at the time, so Emery was commissioned into the General List as a 2nd Lt. (108571). His considerable local knowledge and practical experience was invaluable to those preparing the defence of Egypt against a potential attack from Italian forces to the West and to the South and he was quickly directed to the intelligence desk at General Headquarters (GHQ), British Troops, Egypt, in Cairo. An early preoccupation was to ensure the quantity and quality of mapping to be issued to the mobilised units that were pouring into the kingdom from all quarters of the Empire: the going for vehicles needed to be noted, water-sources, newly-installed enemy defences, etc. Emery's training as a draughtsman was a great asset; his work-colleagues at this time included the future general Victor Paley.https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80022025 By 1942, Emery was a War Substantive (WS) captain, but was serving in the rank of Major. His contribution to the success at Alamein was rewarded with a Mention in Despatches (MiD).https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35821/supplement/5445/data.pdf At the end of the North African campaign, with the successful landing of Allied troops on mainland Italy, Emery was further recognised with the award of a military MBE, in 1943.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/36209/supplement/4541/data.pdf In addition, Emery was later promoted to temporary Lt.Col., on taking command of his branch. After six years, Lt.Col. Emery, MBE, was released from service on 27 November 1945, and his wartime rank was given formal confirmation.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37364/supplement/5745/data.pdf Though not unique, his record was nevertheless impressive for an officer with no previous military experience (PME) who was commissioned after the start of the war: to be promoted from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant-Colonel, and to be awarded an honour in addition, indicated an exceptional contribution that was notable in itself. In the immediate aftermath of the war, with many archaeological sites still off-limits, Emery accepted a diplomatic post with the British embassy in Cairo. Starting as an Attach√© in 1947, he rose to the rank of First Secretary, until his resignation in 1951 to accept an academic role in London.http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/people/walter-bryan- emery Professor of Egyptology In 1951, Emery was appointed Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology at University College London, a seat he held for nearly two decades, to 1970. He was elected to the British Academy Fellowship in 1959, and in 1969 he was awarded a civil CBE for his contribution to Egyptology, superseding his military MBE.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/44863/supplement/5969/data.pdf During the vacations, Professor Emery was able to resume a limited degree of field-work. From the late 1950s, he worked for seven seasons in the Sudan, at Buhen and Qasr Ibrim. Then, in 1964, he returned once more to Saqqara, where he discovered the \\"enclosure of the sacred animals\\". His principal publications are: Great tombs of the 1st dynasty, (3 volumes) 1949-58; Archaic Egypt, 1961; and Egypt in Nubia, 1965. Walter Emery returned to his beloved Egypt but did not enjoy a long retirement: following two strokes, he died in the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo, on 7 March 1971. He was buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Cairo.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/192285045/walter-bryan-emery Bibliography Emery published a number of works, including: *1938 'Excavations at Saqqara - The Tomb of Hemaka.

It is named for the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse which is one block to the north on Fan Pier. The station also serves the Fort Point neighborhood, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and nearby residential and commercial development. Like all Silver Line stations, Courthouse station is accessible. History and design An outbound bus at Courthouse station in 2017 Construction of the $110 million station was technically demanding, as the Waterfront district is built on fill rather than solid ground or rock. Slurry walls and large braces were built, allowing 210,000 cubic yards of soil to be excavated for the platform area. The station was called Fan Pier during early planning until it was determined that the federal courthouse would be located nearby. Because the station was initially surrounded by parking lots, its original headhouses were intended to be temporary until development occurred. The station was also designed to allow two future entrances at the east end of the mezzanine if needed. The station was intended as the centerpiece of the Silver Line and a key feature of Boston's Innovation district, with a visual impact significantly different from other stations in the MBTA system. It includes \\"some of the most complex and ornate station finishes installed in any MBTA transportation facility to date\\" which cost $30 million to complete. The lobby includes a polished stone floor and distinctive purple overhead lighting fixtures, while both the platforms have brushed steel finishes on support columns and walls. The station was turned into an \\"idea lab\\" nightclub and conference center in June 2014 for Boston Idea Week, which included several other MBTA-centered events. Courthouse station opened along with the rest of the South Boston Piers Transitway from South Station to Silver Line Way on December 17, 2004. Through service on the SL2 and SL3 routes serving the Design Center and City Point areas began on December 31, 2004, followed by SL1 service on June 1, 2005. SL3 service was discontinued on March 20, 2009. The station has headhouses on the north and south sides of Seaport Boulevard. The south headhouse was closed from October 5, 2015 until October 2016 due to construction of a hotel on the adjacent lot. SL3 service (a new South Station‚ÄìChelsea route different from the discontinued City Point route) at the station began on April 21, 2018.

Its distribution is now restricted to Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but it previously ranged northward into Minas Gerais, Brazil, and southward into eastern Argentina. The Argentine form may have been distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay. L. molitor is a large rodent, with the head and body length averaging , characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur. It builds nests above the water, supported by reeds, and it is not currently threatened. Its external morphology is similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis, and over the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys. Within the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.  Taxonomy  Lundomys molitor was first described in 1888 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had collected in the caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr. 5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later turned out to be from a different species,Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 6 probably Gyldenstolpia fronto.Pardi√±as et al., 2008, pp. 556‚Äì557 Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 3 In 1926, American zoologist Colin Campbell Sanborn collected some rodents in Uruguay, which he identified as Holochilus vulpinus (currently Holochilus brasiliensis) in his 1929 report on the collection. When his successor at the Field Museum of Natural History, Philip Hershkovitz, reviewed Holochilus in 1955, he recognized that the series from Uruguay contained two species, one close to the forms of Holochilus found across much of South America, and another unique to Uruguay and southern Brazil; he named the latter as a new species, Holochilus magnus. Hershkovitz identified Holochilus as one of the members of a \\"sigmodont\\" group of American rodents, also including Sigmodon, Reithrodon, and Neotomys, on the basis of its flat-crowned molars, which are lophodont (the crown consists of transverse ridges). In 1981, H. magnus was also recognized in the Late Pleistocene of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina,Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 10 and in 1982 it was recorded from Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.Oliveira et al. in Freitas et al., 1983 In a 1980 article, Argentine zoologist Elio Massoia recognized the resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and recommended that the former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor.Voss and Carleton, 1993, pp. 3, 6 When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, they were unable to find any consistent differences between the two and accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 4 In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor. In the same paper in which they described Lundomys, Voss and Carleton also, for the first time, diagnosed the tribe Oryzomyini in a phylogenetically valid way.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 31 Previously, Oryzomyini had been a somewhat loosely defined group defined among others by a long palate and the presence of a crest known as the mesoloph on the upper molars and mesolophid on the lower molars; this crest is absent or reduced in Holochilus and Lundomys.Voss and Carleton, 1993 Voss and Carleton recognized five synapomorphies for the group, all of which are shared by Lundomys; the placement in Oryzomyini of Lundomys and of three other genera‚ÄîHolochilus, Pseudoryzomys, and Zygodontomys‚Äîwhich also lack complete mesoloph(id)s has been universally supported since.Musser and Carleton, 2005; Weksler, 2006 Voss and Carleton had found some support for a close relationship between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys within Oryzomyini.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 1 In subsequent years, the related species Holochilus primigenus and Noronhomys vespuccii were discovered, providing additional evidence for this grouping.Steppan, 1996; Carleton and Olson, 1999 The allocation of the former, which is similar to Lundomys in features of the dentition, to Holochilus is controversial, and placement as a second species of Lundomys has been suggested as an alternative.Pardi√±as, 2008, p. 1275 A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of oryzomyines by Marcelo Weksler, published in 2006, supported a close relationship among Lundomys, Holochilus, and Pseudoryzomys; the other species of the group were not included. Data from the sequence of the IRBP gene supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, with Lundomys more distantly related, but morphological data placed Holochilus and Lundomys closer together, as did the combined analysis of both morphological and IRPB data.Weksler, 2006 Subsequently, Carletonomys cailoi was described as an additional relative of Holochilus and Lundomys.Pardi√±as, 2008  Description  Lundomys molitor is among the largest living oryzomyines, rivaled only by some large forms of Holochilus and Nectomys, but it is substantially smaller than some of the recently extinct Antillean species, such as \\"Ekbletomys hypenemus\\" and Megalomys desmarestii.Weksler, 2006, table 8; Voss and Myers, 1991, table 1; Ray, 1962, tables 7, 11 Unlike in Holochilus brasiliensis, which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 13 It is sparsely haired and dark, and there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellow‚Äìbrown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 7 The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous interdigital webbing, but they lack tufts of hair on the digits and several of the pads are reduced.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 6; Weksler, 2006, p. 23 As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, fringes of hair are present along the plantar margins and between some of the digits.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 7; Weksler, 2006, pp. 24‚Äì25 The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines.Weksler, 2006, pp. 19, 23 The female has four pairs of teats, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of oryzomyines.Voss and Carleton, 1993; Weksler, 2006, table 5 The head and body length is , averaging , the tail length is 195 to 255 mm (7.68 to 10.04 mm), averaging , and the length of the hindfoot is , averaging .Measurements for head and body length and tail length are from 10 specimens, and those for hindfoot length are from 12 specimens, all from Uruguay.Voss and Carleton, 1993, table 2. The front part of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the zygomatic plate, the flattened front portion of the cheek bone, is expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The jugal bone is small, but less reduced than in Holochilus.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 15 The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones,Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 16; Weksler, 2006, pp. 34‚Äì35 and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 16 As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side.Weksler, 2006, p. 40; Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 17 In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 17 The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.Weksler, 2006, p. 47 The molars are slightly more high- crowned (hypsodont) than in most oryzomyines, and many of the accessory crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly derived, hypsodont molars of Holochilus.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 19 The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an accessory crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 20; Weksler, 2006, fig. 25 The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in Lundomys, but absent in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 20; Weksler, 2006, p. 49 Another accessory crest, the anteroloph, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in Lundomys, but entirely absent in both other genera.Weksler, 2006, p. 45 As in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a deep pit.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 20 Each of the three upper molars has three roots; unlike in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the first upper molar lacks an accessory fourth root.Weksler, 2006, pp. 42‚Äì43 The first lower molar has four roots, including two small accessory roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.Weksler, 2006, p. 43 The karyotype contains 52 chromosomes with a total of 58 major arms (2n = 52, FN = 58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a short arm, or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.Freitas et al., 1983; Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 10  Distribution and ecology  Lundomys molitor has been found as a living animal only in Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul; records of live specimens from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in Rio Grande do Sul, but this may be due to insufficient efforts to locate it, rather than genuine rarity.Gonz√°lez et al., 2016; Bonvicino et al., 2008 Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.Teta and Pardi√±as, 2006, p. 179 Pleistocene fossils have been found throughout its current range and beyond it. In Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul, the Lujanian (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) Sopas Formation has yielded remains of L. molitor, in addition to such other mammals as the extinct saber-toothed cat Smilodon populator and species of Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon.Oliveira and Kerber, 2009; Ubilla et al., 2004 The type locality, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live L. molitor; there, it is known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr. 5\\\\. This cave also contains numerous remains of members of the extinct South American megafauna, such as ground sloths, litopternans, gomphotheres, and glyptodonts, in addition to 16 species of cricetid rodents, but it is not certain that all remains from this cave are from the same age.Voss and Myers, 1991, table 5, p. 429 Remains of Lundomys have been found at six Pleistocene localities in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, which suggests a warm and humid paleoclimate there.Teta and Pardi√±as, 2006 The oldest deposits, at Bajo San Jos√©, date to Marine Isotopic Stage 11, about 420,000 to 360,000 years ago, while younger specimens from other localities are as little as 30,000 years old.Teta and Pardi√±as, 2006, p. 180 The younger Argentine Lundomys specimens are subtly distinct from living Lundomys in some features of the first lower molar and may represent a distinct species. One lower first molar of this form has length 3.28 mm.Pardi√±as and Lezcano, 1995, pp. 258‚Äì259 Because the Bajo San Jos√© material does not contain lower first molars, it is impossible to determine whether this material also pertains to the later Argentine Lundomys form. The morphology of the upper and lower jaw precludes an identification as Holochilus primigenus, a fossil species with molar traits almost identical to those of Lundomys.Pardi√±as and Deschamps, 1995, p. 850 The length of the upper toothrow of one specimen from this locality is and the length of the upper first molar is ,Pardi√±as and Deschamps, 1995, table 2 slightly smaller than in living Lundomys, which ranges from in four specimensPardi√±as, 2008, table 1  Natural history  Lundomys molitor is semiaquatic in habits, spending much of its time in the water, and is active during the night.Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 34 An excellent swimmer,Carleton and Olson, 1999, p. 52 it is even more specialized for swimming than is Holochilus.Hershkovitz, 1955, p. 658 It builds a spherical nest among reeds in up to deep water, usually about above the water. The material for the nest, which is in diameter and 9 to 11 cm (about 4 in) in height, comes from the surrounding reeds. Its wall consists of three layers, surrounding a central chamber, which is connected to the water by a ramp, also composed of reeds.Sierra de Soriano in Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 34 Nests built by members of the related genus Holochilus are similar in many details. Several dissected stomachs contained green plant material, suggesting that it is herbivorous, like Holochilus.Barley in Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 34 A female caught in April was pregnant with three embryos, which were about long.Tuttle in Voss and Carleton, 1993, p. 32 The mites Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni and Amblyomma dubitatum have been found on specimens of L. molitor in Uruguay.Lareschi et al., 2006; Nava et al., 2010, table 1 Other rodents found in association with it include Scapteromys tumidus, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Reithrodon auritus, Akodon azarae, Oxymycterus nasutus, and Holochilus brasiliensis.Voss and Carleton, 1993, pp. 32‚Äì34  Conservation status  The species' conservation status is currently assessed as \\"least concern\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, reflecting a relatively wide distribution and the absence of evidence for a decline in populations. Several of the areas where it occurs are protected, but the destruction of its habitat may pose a threat to its continued existence.

Plot Andy Farmer (Chase) is a New York City sports writer who moves with his wife, Elizabeth (Smith) to the seemingly charming town of Redbud, Vermont, so he can write a novel. They do not get along well with the residents, and other quirks arise such as being given exorbitant funeral bills for a long-dead man buried on their land years before they acquired the house. Marital troubles soon arise from the quirkiness of Redbud as well as the fact that Elizabeth was critical of Andy's manuscript, while having her own manuscripts for children's books published. They soon decide to divorce and sell their home. To expedite the sale, the Farmers offer the town's residents a $15,000 donation to Redbud, and $50 cash each if they help make a good impression on their prospective home buyers. To that end, the citizens remake Redbud into a perfect Norman Rockwell-style town. Their charade dazzles a pair of prospective buyers, who make the Farmers an offer on the house; however, Andy declines to sell, realizing that he genuinely enjoys small-town living. He and Elizabeth decide to stay together in Redbud, much to the chagrin of the locals, who are now angry that they lost their promised money. Though the mayor does not hold the Farmers liable for the $15,000, as the sale of their house did not occur, Andy decides to pay everyone in Redbud their $50, which helps improve his standing among the townspeople. The film ends with Andy taking a job as a sports writer for the Redbud newspaper, and Elizabeth, now pregnant with their first child, having written multiple children's stories.

He was a comedy hero of mine and still is.‚Äù Boam says the tone of the film changed from what he expected when director George Roy Hill signed. \\"George wanted to do a much classier version than I ever imagined it to be,\\" said Boam. \\"I imagined it to be a little cruder, more low-brow humor, rougher and more like the movies Chevy was doing at the time, but George was a classy guy and he wasn‚Äôt going to do that. He does what he does. He made the movie classy, and I think a lot of Chevy‚Äôs fans were let down because it wasn‚Äôt as raucous and vulgar as they might have expected.\\" Reception Funny Farm received mixed reviews at the time of its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65%, based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. Vincent Canby, in his review for The New York Times, called the film \\"good-natured even when it's not funny,\\" and went on to say that its best jokes are recycled from other, better, films. In a negative review for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Wilmington said \\"Funny Farm ‚Äì a weak-fish-out- of-water comedy about a New York City couple who see their rural paradise turned into a rustic hell‚Äìis a movie with a doubly deceptive title. This movie isn't about a farm, and it isn't very funny, either.\\" In a staff review, Variety said, \\"As pleasant yuppie comedies go, this is about par.\\" However, film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel were strong champions of the film, praising it on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Ebert called the film a \\"small miracle,\\" while Siskel said it was \\"the best film Chase has made\\" and compared it to the films of Preston Sturges. Dialog from the film was sampled by rapper Cool Calm Pete as the intro for his album Lost. The film grossed $25 million on a $19 million budget, making it a modest box office success, but was seen as an overall disappointment especially considering Chevy Chase's popularity as a comic actor in the 1980s with a handful of box office hits. It was released during a very busy summer movie season. The Tom Hanks comedy Big, now considered a classic comedy, opened the very same day and became one of the year's highest grossing films while Crocodile Dundee II was in its second week of release and also became one of the year's biggest hits. Other releases throughout the summer including Coming to America, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Die Hard all were very high- grossing films giving Funny Farm a slim chance of high box office results in comparison. Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam has also said he felt the film did not do as well as hoped because Chase was known at the time for doing edgier comedies such as National Lampoon's Vacation and his fans were expecting similar humor from this film as a result. With the success of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation the following year, Funny Farm did eventually gain a cult following and is now regarded by critics and Chevy Chase fans as one of if not his very best films.

It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Description The hairy-tailed bolo mouse grows to a head-and-body length of between , with a tail length of . The ears are small and rounded and have a sparse covering of hair. The body fur is variable in colour but usually the back is olive grey to dark brown, the flanks are paler and washed with ochre, and the underparts are white or pale grey. The demarcation line between upper parts and underparts is ill-defined. The tail is bicolor, dark above and pale below, and clad in short, fairly dense fur, and the feet are brown on top with tufts of white hair between the digits, which have strong nails. Distribution and habitat The hairy-tailed bolo mouse is native to southern South America. Its range extends from eastern and central Brazil as far west as Rond√¥nia, through eastern Paraguay to northeastern Argentina. The exact boundaries are not well known, with various isolated outlying areas and with populations west of the Paraguay River overlapping the range of the Paraguayan bolo mouse (Necromys lenguarum). Its typical habitat is grassland, the verges of cultivated fields and areas of secondary woodland. Ecology The hairy-tailed bolo mouse is mainly diurnal, with some activity at dusk and at night, particularly in the dry season. Its diet varies with the time of year but mainly consists of seeds and green plant material, and sometimes includes small invertebrates. The breeding season is mostly in the spring and summer and litter sizes average about five young. This mouse is a reservoir for certain hantaviruses, including the Araraquara strain from Brazil which can cause disease in humans. The Hairy-tailed bolo mouse is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Moniliformis necromysi.

Pinnock, the first Baptist missionary to the ancient empire of Oyo established a mission post. Olivet Newsletter No. 3 - January 2003 Retrieved 2007-10-13 History The profile of Olivet witnessed a remarkable rise in the 1960s when the school was noted for all-round excellence in academics and sports, the school had facilities for O'level and A'level (HSC) candidates at that time. The A'level program was abolished in 1989. The school was one of the few schools in Nigeria outside Lagos equipped with hostel facilities, staff quarters, excellent laboratories (sciences, home economics/food & nutrition, fine arts, music), workshops (metal work, wood work, technical drawing - mechanical/building), agricultural center with poultry/fish pond and sports facilities. As a result, Olivet Heights was a domineering force in the western part of Nigeria in inter-school academic competitions/projects as well as sports: soccer, basketball, hockey, handball and athletics. Also available in the school were facilities for Lawn Tennis, Cricket, Squash, Badminton, Volleyball, Chess and Table Tennis. Most of the facilities witnessed a steady decay from the 1990s.  Organization of School Houses  Olivet Heights is a predominantly residential high school. The hostel structure was organized into four \\"houses\\" named after two indigenous and two American Baptist pastors - Atanda, Odetayo, Locket, and Pinnock. In addition to the residential arrangement for boarding students, non-residential students were also assigned to the 4 Houses for annual inter-house (intramural) quiz, debates & sports competitions which are used to unearth promising talents for regional and national competitions. In recent years, two new houses were added - Homer Brown and JBP Lafinhan - in honor of the last American (missionary) Principal and the first Nigerian Principal. Principals *Mrs. J. C.

It is from Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay ‚Äî found primarily near forest rivers and streams in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion.  Description  Nectomys squamipes, or the South American water rat can be distinguished from other Sigmodontinae based on their size and morphology of their hindfeet. They are the largest of the family (average of 216g) and have long hind legs with partially webbed feet to aid in swimming and have completely scaled heels. Nectomys is derived from Greek words meaning \\"mouse\\" and \\"swimming\\". One unique morphological characteristic is the distinct primitive cuspidate pattern of their cheekteeth, which have hypsodont molars, teeth crowned earlier in life and the outer fold of the upper molars tend to be more isolated as enamel islands. The Nectomys squamipe tends to have relatively longer, less hairy ears and a glossy, long pelage. This pelage is made up of wool hairs and guard hairs and is darker dorsally and tends to be lighter grey on its sides and ventrally. The tail is much less covered in hair, and length is around 75% of the body length. N. squamipes have a larger skull that occupies well-developed supraorbital ridges and lambdoidal crests, giving the mammal great attachments for jaw muscles and a strong bite. This strong bite is shown useful with its large, strong incisors that are greatly curved.  Distribution and habitat  The South American water rat inhabits elevations from sea level to around 2,000 m, in areas from the northern coast of South America to Brazil, Argentina and the western slope of the Andes. Almost all of these mammals are found a small (2 m) distance from tropical forest streams and rivers. They tend to prefer the moist habitats in forested areas such as swamps or marshes, and are sometimes found inhabiting caves  Predation  The South American water rat has mainly one predator, the barn owl (Tyto alba). They are most vulnerable at night when the barn owls are hunting and the nocturnal rat is out of its nest. Nectomys squamipes are very good swimmers and climbers, which act as short-term defenses against predation. Their darkened dorsal pelage may also act as camouflage.  Diet  Nectomys sqaumipes is an omnivorous mammal with a diet ranging from fruits and leaves to insects and small fish. The South American water rat tends to feed more often after the end of the wet season, when food is in abundance. Many newborn water rats will grow bigger during this time period, because they have access to more food than those born during drier periods.  Life history and reproduction  The South American water rat is a polygynous mammal in which males will increase their home range in attempt to mate with many females to produce the most offspring possible. Although males tend to be sexually active all year long, seasonal breeding patterns are suggested since females have a higher pregnancy rate during the wet season, which is August to November in South America. This will produce offspring that have an abundant food source when born, resulting in greater growth and larger populations. Gestation periods last around 30 days and young have an average body length between 10-11 grams, with litters as small as 1 offspring and as large as 7. Males are generally absent when raising the altricial young, so the female is responsible for feeding and caring for their young.  Behavior  Nectomys squamipes is a solitary mammal that is active during the night. The males have a much less defined home range and tend to roam, while the females are very territorial. When swimming and searching for food, the South American water rat is able to detect objects under water and lift them above the surface in order to inspect to see if the object is edible or not using olfaction and sight. When hunting on land it is able to secure prey but pouncing and grasping with its forepaws. Nests are generally built that are similar to those of birds and consists of dry twigs and leaves woven together. They are built inside dead trees alongside streams and under dense vegetation for protection.  Transmission of disease  Nectomys squamipes is commonly studied as a reservoir for the organism Schistosoma mansoni, which causes the disease Schistosomiasis. This disease is caused by parasitic worms found in freshwater, which may have been consumed by the South American water rat. Studies focus in endemic areas of Brazil that have large populations of N. squamipes, in attempt to find a correlation between the water rat and disease in residents of endemic areas. A great correlation between species presence and disease has been shown. References Literature cited *D'Andrea, P.S., C. Horta, and L.

(2005). Conferment. Manila: DLSU Press. He was President of De La Salle University from 1961 to 1966 and was named its President Emeritus in 1981.  Early life  He was born Richard Henry Duerr in 1922 in Brooklyn, New York, the third of four children. He studied at St. James Diocesan High School in Loughlin and St. Joseph's Normal Institute in Barrytown, New York, graduating valedictorian from both schools. In 1935, at the age of 13, he entered the junior novitiate of the Christian Brothers in New York and began his postulancy on June 26, 1936. On September 7, 1936, he received the religious habit and was given the religious name Crescentius Richard. In 1941, Brother Duerr earned a Bachelor of Science, with major in Chemistry and a minor in Biology, from The Catholic University of America and in 1948, he received his Master's degree from Fordham University.  Early career  Upon Duerr's graduation from the Catholic University of America, he began a career of teaching. He spent the first 12 years of that career in New York City and Washington, D.C., handling a variety of students, from fifth graders at Saint Mary's Parochial School in New York to the college students of the Manhattan College or La Salle College, teaching General Chemistry, Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis, College Mathematics, and the General Science, among others.  Assignment to the Philippines  In 1953 Duerr volunteered for mission service and was assigned to the Philippines, being first posted to De La Salle College. He was assigned to La Salle Academy-Iligan in 1958, the University of St. La Salle in Bacolod in 1969, and La Salle Green Hills in 1980.  Presidency of De La Salle College  In 1961, Duerr was appointed President of De La Salle College. During his term, he was instrumental in accomplishing the College's post-World War II growth including the conferment of academic accreditations upon the College. He also institutionalized the use of modern management techniques such as educational planning and budgeting to promote efficiency and initiated the formation of a Board of Trustees and the incorporation of the school as a non-stock, non- profit corporation. During his term, he also oversaw the construction of De La Salle University's William Hall. On July 17, 1981, in recognition of his contributions to the growth of the Lasallian schools in the Philippines, Br. Richard was conferred the title of President Emeritus by De La Salle University.  Return to the United States  In 1984, after his stint at La Salle Green Hills, Duerr chose to settle down to Lincroft, New Jersey. He was thus assigned to the Christian Brothers Provincialate in Lincroft in 1984 to De La Salle Hall in 1987 and to the Christian Brothers Academy in 1992. In 2001, he was again posted at De La Salle Hall, where he stayed until his death on June 18, 2005.

It lives off the coast of eastern Australia from the coast to a depth of . This shark can be distinguished from other members of its family by the large size of the ridges above its eyes and by its color pattern of large dark blotches. It typically attains a length of . Nocturnal and bottom-dwelling, the crested bullhead shark favors rocky reefs and vegetated areas, where it hunts for sea urchins and other small organisms. It is oviparous, with females producing auger- shaped egg capsules that are secured to seaweed or sponges with long tendrils. Sexual maturation is slow, with one female in captivity not laying eggs until almost 12 years of age. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this harmless shark as of Least Concern; it is of no economic interest and suffers minimal mortality from bycatch, recreational fishing, and shark nets. Taxonomy British zoologist Albert G√ºnther originally described the crested bullhead shark as Cestracion galeatus in the 1870 eighth volume of Catalogue of the Fishes in the British Museum. He chose the specific epithet galeatus from the Latin for \\"helmeted\\", referring to the prominent ridges above the shark's eyes that also give it its common name. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genera Gyropleurodus and Molochophrys before placing it in Heterodontus. The type specimen is a 68-cm-long female caught off Australia. This shark may also be referred to as crested shark, crested bull shark, crested horn shark, and crested Port Jackson shark. Description The high ridges above the eyes of the crested bullhead shark are its most distinctive feature. The head of the crested bullhead shark is short and wide, with a blunt, pig-like snout. The eyes are placed high on the head and lack nictitating membranes. The supraorbital ridges above the eyes of this species are larger than any other member of its family. The nostrils are separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a long flap of skin that reaches the mouth. A furrow encircles the incurrent opening and another furrow runs from the excurrent opening to the mouth, which is located nearly at the tip of the snout. The teeth at the front of the jaws are small and pointed with a central cusp and two lateral cusplets, while those at the back of the jaws are wide and molar-like. The deep furrows at the corners of the mouth extend onto both jaws. The pectoral fins are large and rounded, while the pelvic and anal fins are smaller and more angular. The first dorsal fin is moderately tall with a rounded to angular apex and a stout spine on the leading margin, originating behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin resembles the first and is almost as large, and is located between the pelvic and anal fins. The caudal fin is broad, with a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are large and rough, especially on the flanks. The coloration consists of five brown to black, diffusely edged saddles on a light tan background. There are dark marks on top of the head between the crests and below each eye. Most crested bullhead sharks measure no more than long, but a few may reach . Distribution and habitat The crested bullhead shark is found on or near the bottom. The range of the crested bullhead shark is restricted to the warm temperate waters along the eastern coast of Australia, from Cape Moreton, Queensland, to Batemans Bay, New South Wales. Also dubious records exist of this species from off Cape York Peninsula in the north and Tasmania in the south. This species co-occurs with the related Port Jackson shark (H. portusjacksoni) across much of its range, but is generally much rarer except off southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, where it tends to replace the other species. Bottom-dwelling in nature, the crested bullhead shark is found over the continental shelf from the intertidal zone to a depth of , being more common in deeper waters. It prefers rocky reefs, mats of seaweed, and seagrass beds. Biology and ecology A crested bullhead shark feeding on an egg of the Port Jackson shark. The crested bullhead shark is a slow-moving, nocturnal species often seen wedging its head between rocks in search of food. It feeds primarily on the sea urchins Centrostephanus rodgersii and Heliocidaris erythrogramma, but has also been known to take a variety of other invertebrates and small fishes. A steady diet of sea urchins may stain the teeth of this shark pinkish purple. The crested bullhead shark is also a major predator of the eggs of the Port Jackson shark, which are seasonally available and rich in nutrients. Individual sharks have been observed taking the egg capsules in their mouths and chewing on the tough casing, rupturing it and allowing the contents to be sucked out; egg capsules may also be swallowed whole. Unlike the Port Jackson shark, the crested bullhead shark is not known to form large aggregations. The egg case of the crested bullhead shark has distinctive, long tendrils at one end. Crested bullhead sharks are oviparous with a possibly annual reproductive cycle. Females produce 10-16 eggs per year during late winter in July and August, though Michael (1993) noted that egg-laying may continue year-round. The egg cases measure around in length, with a pair of thin flanges spiraling 6-7 times around the outside and two slender tendrils up to long at one end, used to attach the capsule to seaweed or sponges. The capsules are usually deposited at a depth of , much deeper than the Port Jackson shark, though there is a single record of an egg being found only down. The time to hatching has been variously reported as 5 and 8-9 months; the newly emerged young measure long and resemble the adults. Last and Stevens (1994) gave the lengths at maturity for males and females at and , respectively, though mature males as small as long were later found off Queensland. Growth and aging has been documented for one captive female at the Taronga Park Aquarium, which grew an average of per year and did not lay eggs until she was almost 12 years old. Human interactions Inoffensive towards humans, the crested bullhead shark is of little interest to recreational or commercial fisheries. It is seldom caught on hook-and-line. Commercial bottom trawl prawn fisheries operating off Queensland and New South Wales take this species as bycatch; the impact of these activities on the population is uncertain as this species is not recorded separately from the Port Jackson shark. However, most bullhead sharks caught in these fisheries survive to be released alive. Crested bullhead sharks are likely also caught in mesh shark nets used to protect beaches; again, most are able to survive the experience. Because of the limited mortality suffered by this species from various human activities, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, albeit also recommending that it be carefully monitored given its restricted distribution and overall uncommonness. The range of the crested bullhead shark overlaps with several marine protected areas; additionally, it was listed as a declared animal in Schedule 3 of the 1997 Queensland Marine Parks (Moreton Bay) Zoning Plan, which regulates its collection in Moreton Bay Marine Park.

Biography He was born at Mainz on 2 January 1817. He attended the gymnasium at Mainz, studied theology at Gie√üen, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest at Mainz on 14 August 1839. His first charge was that of chaplain at Seligenstadt. Like his colleague, Christoph Moufang, he was one of the founders and teachers of the Progymnasium of that city. He became spiritual director of St. Rochus Hospital at Mainz in 1845, and pastor at Abenheim near Worms in 1847. On 21 June 1852, he was appointed director of the Hessian Catholic teachers' training college at Bensheim. During the fifteen years of his administration, encouraged by Bishop von Ketteler, Ohler laboured to infuse a better spirit into the Catholic teaching body of Hesse. On 8 April 1867, he was made a canon of the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral, given charge of educational matters, and appointed lecturer in pedagogy and catechetics at the episcopal seminary - a position he held until the seminary was closed during the Kulturkampf in 1878. He died in Mainz on 24 August 1889. Writings Ohler's chief work is \\"Lehrbuch der Erziehung und des Unterrichtes\\" (Mainz, 1861; 10th ed., 1884). The fundamental idea of the work is that the education of Catholic youth should be conducted on Catholic principles, Church and school co- operating harmoniously to this end. The work was intended for the use of the clergy as well as for teachers. Ohler adapted from the Italian: \\"Cajetanus maria von Bergamo, Ermahnungen im Beichtstuhle\\" (5th ed., Mainz, 1886), \\"Johannes Baptista Lambruschini, Der geistliche F√ºhrer\\" (Mainz, 1848; 12th ed., 1872), and an abridged edition of the latter, \\"Der kleine geistliche F√ºhrer\\" (1851; 6th ed., 1861).

(Formerly known as Ajax Cape Town) is a South African professional football club based in Parow in the city of Cape Town that plays in the National First Division. Dutch Eredivisie club AFC Ajax was their parent club and majority shareholder until selling its shares in September 2020. The team plays its home matches at Cape Town Stadium. History Ajax Cape Town was formed in 1999 via the amalgamation of two Cape Town-based teams, Seven Stars and Cape Town Spurs, as AFC Ajax expanded their worldwide talent-feeder network to South Africa. Ajax Cape Town was originally founded by John Comitis and Rob Moore in 1999. John Comitis, the honouree life chairman of Ajax Cape Town, later sold his shares in the club after 14 years at the helm and is now the chairmen of his new football team, Cape Town City Football Club. Ajax, nicknamed Urban Warriors, played their first official game against Kaizer Chiefs in the Iwisa Charity Spectacular on 17 July 1999. Ajax caused an upset when they beat Chiefs 1‚Äì0 with Sam Pam, the Ajax Cape Town captain, scoring the winning goal. Former South Africa national team coach Gordon Igesund, the country's most successful club coach,Soccer in South Africa who won league titles with Manning Rangers, Orlando Pirates, Santos and Sundowns, coached the club from 2002 until 2006. Since coming into existence, Ajax has never won the league title with their highest finish being runners-up in 2003‚Äì04, 2007‚Äì08 and 2010‚Äì11. Ajax managed to win the Rothmans Cup in 2000, the Nedbank Cup in 2007, the Telkom Knockout in 2008 and most recently the MTN8 in 2015. In January 2007 Ajax CT managed to beat AFC Ajax 3‚Äì1 in a friendly game held in Cape Town. The next friendly, played in Amsterdam, ended in a 3‚Äì2 win for AFC Ajax in July 2009. Over the years several Ajax CT players have made the step to the mother club, among them Steven Pienaar in 2002, Daylon Claasen in 2009, Eyong Enoh in 2008 and Thulani Serero in 2011. In July 2013, it was announced that the Comitis brothers, longtime partners and shareholders with the Efstathiou brothers, had sold their shares to the Efstathiou family. Ari Efstathiou was announced as the new chairman, and Muhsin Ertuƒüral was reinstated as manager of the club, following an interim managerial period after originally being hired as the club's new technical director. In September 2015, Ajax won the 2015 MTN8 tournament edging Kaizer Chiefs 1‚Äì0 in the final. Ajax were relegated to the National First Division after finishing bottom in the 2017‚Äì18 season. Ajax finished in 4th place, outside of the playoff positions, in the 2018‚Äì19 National First Division, and again failed to achieve promotion the following season after losing in the playoffs to Black Leopards. Shortly after, Ajax Amsterdam sold their 51% share in Ajax Cape Town. Youth programme Since the inception of the club, Ajax Cape Town have imported the AFC Ajax philosophy and effective youth development schemes in the Western Cape. The majority of the senior squad players have come up from the club's own youth ranks, such as the likes of Nazeer Allie, Granwald Scott and Thulani Hlatshwayo, while others such as Steven Pienaar and Thulani Serero have moved on to some of the top clubs in Europe. With the introduction of the Ajax Cape Town Community Scheme in conjunction with the South African Police Services, Ajax CT also provides football opportunities to young people within the greater Cape Town area regardless of race, gender, social status or disability, facilitated through structured programs in a safe and fun learning environment. Since then the Ajax Cape Town Community Scheme has been implemented in more than 120 schools across the Western Cape as far as the Cape Winelands, reaching more than 8,000 children. Stadium In the beginning Ajax CT played their home games at Athlone Stadium and Newlands Stadium. The latter is a 51,900 capacity venue, which was first built in 1888, and was also host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup opening match. Essentially being a rugby stadium, it was a home they shared with clubs Santos and Vasco da Gama, as well as rugby teams Stormers and Western Province. Athlone Stadium was home to the Santos and has a capacity of 30,000. The stadium located in Athlone, Cape Town was also host to some of Ajax CT early home matches as well. Moving to the Green Point Stadium, an 18,000 seat multi-purpose stadium in the Green Point area of Cape Town. The stadium was eventually demolished in 2007 to make way for the new Cape Town Stadium for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Construction of the new stadium was completed in 2009, and the Urban Warriors have played their home games at the Cape Town Stadium since the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 Premier Soccer League season to an improved capacity of 55,000. On 3 August 2011 a contract extension of three years was negotiated with the stadium, which will see Ajax CT playing their home games there until 2014. The first match played at the new stadium was a Cape Town derby between Ajax CT and Santos on 23 January 2010 as part of the official inauguration of the stadium. Ajax Cape Town trains at their home base located in Parow. (). It serves as the training grounds for the senior squad, as well as for the Ajax Cape Town Youth Development Academy. It has hosted a number of foreign clubs among them German Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart during their midseason camp in 2014 as well as Viking FK from Norway.

In Asturian fashion, she is known by many nicknames, such as Nenuca, Carmelilla, Carmencita, Cotota and Morita. Family Franco was born in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. It is alleged that she was actually the daughter of Francisco Franco's younger brother, Ram√≥n Franco and a prostitute who died shortly after giving birth.

The arms are a variation of the arms of the de Andrade family of Galicia, from whom she is twice descended from the Pardo de Andrade branch, and twice again from the 7th counts of Lemos and Sarria. Controversy  In 2008, she collaborated with Stanley G. Payne and Jes√∫s Palacios Tapias to write Franco, My Father, a biography of her father from her point of view. She described her father as a warm person. With regards to the White Terror, she noted that \\"he did not talk about it at home\\". Franco is referred to as \\"General√≠simo\\" or \\"Head of State\\", who was an \\"intelligent and moderate\\", a \\"brave and Catholic\\" man and who established an \\"authoritarian but not totalitarian\\" regime., online: Franco chaired the Francisco Franco National Foundation, which is under criticism for its revisionist opinions such as calling the Spanish coup of July 1936 an \\"armed referendum\\". The Spanish historian Borja de Riquer called that a euphemism with reference to an era in which approximately 140,000 Spaniards were executed in a reign of terror by the Falange, the Guardia Civil and other Nationalist organisations. During the premiership of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar the foundation received financial support from the Spanish Minister of Education and Culture. Funding was terminated in 2004.

It is the southern trailhead of the Legacy Trail, which runs along the railroad's former right of way. It currently serves as a hub for bus service operated by Sarasota County Area Transit (SCAT). On August 17, 1989, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History Viewing depot from south end of station platform and railroad tracks. View of depot platform through archway. In the 1870s, Richard Roberts established a homestead near Roberts Bay. In 1884, he sold a portion of his holdings to Frank Higel. Higel established a citrus operation involving the production of several lines of canned citrus items, and for the next 30 years the Higel family members were boat builders, fishermen, grove caretakers and contractors. Darwin Curry was the first postmaster. The Higel and Curry families chose the name \\"Venice\\" for their community post office, located south of Shakett Creek on what is now Portia Street in the unincorporated community of Nokomis. The Seaboard Air Line (SAL) was the first railroad to expand its network into Sarasota County, Florida, extending tracks first to Sarasota in 1903 and Fruitville in 1905. The SAL extended their network into Venice in 1911, at the instigation of Mrs. Potter (\\"Bertha\\") Palmer, whose family had just purchased thousands of acres south of Fruitville and adjacent to the Venice area. The first depot in Venice was located originally at the junction of what is now Tampa and Nokomis Avenues. In 1925, Fred H. Albee purchased of land from the Venice-Sarasota Company. Albee had previously developed Nokomis and built its first luxury hotel, known as the Pollyanna Inn. Albee asked John Nolen to design a city on his land, but Albee did not have a chance to implement his city plan before he was approached with a proposal from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) to purchase the land in October 1925. The purchase was motivated by a desire by the BLE to increase the union's assets and holdings in the area. The BLE Realty Corporation was organized to develop the area, and the Venice Company was created to market property. The company retained Nolen to complete a city plan in 1926. Nolen moved the SAL tracks eastward to the present location of the Venice depot. The new depot was designed by New York architectural firm of Walker & Gillette (still extant today under the name Swanke Hayden Connell Architects), who the BLE retained to design most of the new buildings they were planning for Venice. Walker & Gillette designed the depot in harmony with the other structures in Venice, adopting a Mediterranean Revival style then highly popular in Florida due to its warm climate and Spanish heritage. The spare, unornamented exterior yellow stucco surfaces, in combination with the simple arched and blocky volumes gently-sloping red tile roofs seen in the depot building are the hallmarks of this style. The structure of the building under the stucco used a hollow clay tile. For a town as small as Venice was, the train station was commodious, boasting a 400-foot-long platform, baggage and freight rooms, a prominent tower, extensive arcades spanning the length of the platform, and (as was normal in much of the United States at the time) segregated white and colored waiting rooms. As Venice was a planned city, the large size of the depot can probably be explained by its founders' hopes that it would grow to the point where it would require such a grand reception for prodigious rail service. The total cost of the depot was $47,500. It opened for service on March 27, 1927. The Venice Seaboard Air Line Depot became an important point of transit for the city over the next forty-five years. It was served by great SCL trains such as the Camellia and the Orange Blossom Special. The station regularly welcomed Kentucky Military Institute students and faculty for annual winter terms, beginning in January 1933. It became the primary point of entry to the city for U.S. Army material and personnel once the Army established an air base in Venice in 1942, during World War II. In 1960s, when passenger rail traffic had become moribund across the US, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus used it for shipping their equipment and operations around the country once they moved to Venice in 1960. Operations were taken over by the new Seaboard Coast Line in 1967 when it was formed from the merger of the SAL and its rival, the Atlantic Coast Line Railway. Passenger service to the station finally ceased on April 30, 1971 with the consolidation of nearly all the nation's passenger trains into the new National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), which came into existence the following day, May 1. The last passenger train crew operating from Venice to Tampa on April 30, 1971 consisted of Frank Riddle, Engineer; James Marshall, Conductor; John Scott, Fireman and (unknown), Baggage Master. In 1998, Sarasota County acquired the building, which is the last extant railroad depot in its jurisdiction, and local government undertook restoration of the structure, including archaeological excavations. Today the city of Venice has incorporated the grounds of the historic depot into the Venetian Waterway Park, which covers both banks of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, bordering the depot's grounds to the west. The SAL tracks have largely been removed and the station now houses the Venice Area Historical Society Museum, along with event space that can be privately rented. Bus service to the area is provided from the arcaded waiting area at the south end of the station. A former red Seaboard Air Line freight car, now restored and used as offices for the Historical Society, stands beyond the station's north end adjacent to a large freestanding wooden deck. A historic marker was installed by the Sarasota County Historical Commissions in 2003.

This benthic shark occurs at depths of over rocky bottoms or kelp beds. Measuring up to long, it can be identified by its short, blunt head, two high dorsal fins with anterior spines, and pattern of irregularly shaped, vertical brown bands and stripes. The Japanese bullhead shark is a docile, slow-swimming species that feeds mainly on shelled invertebrates and small bony fishes. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying spiral-flanged eggs in communal \\"nests\\". This species is of little interest to fisheries. Taxonomy The Japanese bullhead shark was originally described as Cestracion japonicus by ichthyologists Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay and William John Macleay, in an 1884 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The type specimen is a female caught off Tokyo. Other common names used for this species include bull head, cat shark, Japanese horn shark, Cestracion shark, and Port Jackson shark (which usually refers to Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Description The color pattern of the Japanese bullhead shark distinguish it from similar species. A modest- sized shark reaching a maximum known length of , the Japanese bullhead shark has a cylindrical body with the short, wide head and blunt, pig-like snout typical of the bullhead sharks. The eyes lack a nictitating membrane and are followed by tiny spiracles. Shallow supraorbital ridges are present above the eyes, and the space between them is slightly concave. The nostrils are divided into incurrent and excurrent openings by long flaps of skin that reach the mouth; the incurrent opening is encircled by a groove while another groove runs from the excurrent opening to the mouth. The small mouth is positioned nearly at the tip of the snout; the front teeth are small with a sharp central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets, while the back teeth are broad and rounded. There are deep furrows at the corners of the mouth, extending onto both jaws.. Despite the research done, the morphology is not well understood. A recent research shows that the spiracle of elasmobranchs is a gill- slitderived tube located behind the eye. [author=Tomita T year=2018 The first dorsal fin is very large and high, and is somewhat falcate (sickle-shaped); it originates over the bases of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is much smaller, but similar in shape, and originates over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. Both dorsal fins bear stout spines on their leading edges. The pectoral fins are large; the pelvic fins are much smaller than the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is placed well in front of the caudal fin, which is broad with a short lower lobe and a long upper lobe bearing a strong ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are large and rough, particularly on the sides of the body. The coloration is light brown, with a series of diffuse-edged, darker wide bands interspersed with narrower stripes from snout to tail, numbering 11-14 in all. A faint lighter band is on top of the head between the eyes, and a darker blotch is beneath each eye. Distribution and habitat The range of the Japanese bullhead shark extends from Japan to the Korean Peninsula, and southward along the coast of China to Taiwan. A single, apparently erroneous, record from off East Africa is reported. This bottom- dwelling shark inhabits the continental shelf at a depth of , preferring areas covered by rocks, rocky reefs, or kelp. Biology and ecology A Japanese bullhead shark off Kawana, Japan The Japanese bullhead shark is a slow-moving predator that feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, small fishes, and sea urchins, often hunting for them while \\"walking\\" along the sea bottom with alternating motions of its pectoral and pelvic fins. When prey is found, it is seized with highly protrusible jaws and ground to pieces with the molar-like rear teeth. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Dissonus pastinum, and the haemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina heterodontii. Like other members of its family, the Japanese bullhead shark is oviparous. Females produce large egg capsules bearing thin flanges spiraling three times around the outside and a pair of short tendrils at the tip. The eggs are deposited at a depth of within beds of rock or kelp. Several females may spawn communally in a single \\"nest\\", which may contain up to 15 eggs total, though the females abandon the site afterward.Martin, R.A. Heterodontiformes: Bullhead Sharks. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on October 28, 2009. In Japanese waters, females lay pairs of eggs 6-12 times between March and September, with a peak in spawning activity in March and April. The eggs take about a year to hatch; the newborns measure long. Young sharks have proportionately higher dorsal fins and a similar but brighter color pattern than adults. Males attain sexual maturity at a length of . Human interactions Harmless to humans, the Japanese bullhead shark can be easily hand-caught by divers. It is of only minor fisheries interest as a source of food in Japan and likely elsewhere. It is also exhibited in Japanese public aquariums. The conservation status of this species has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has apparently disappeared from offshore waters in the Bohai Sea, possibly as a consequence of climate change.

Description Gardner's climbing mouse is one of the larger members of the genus, with a head-and-body length of and a tail rather longer than the body. The dorsal fur is short and rather coarse, varying in colour from grey to orange-brown, each hair being banded. The underparts are yellowish, the hairs on the throat and in the centre of the chest having grey bases. The tail is dark brown, clad in short hairs with a short tuft of hairs at the tip. The ears are rounded and of medium size. The dark patch on the upper surface of the large hind feet does not extend onto the toes. Distribution and habitat Gardner's climbing mouse is native to southeastern Peru and Acre State, the most westerly state in Brazil, as well as the northeasterly part of Bolivia. It occurs in both primary and secondary forest, and its altitudinal range is between or more. It occurs in the drainages of the Rivers Juru√°, Ucayeli, Madre de Dios and Beni. Status Gardiner's climbing mouse has a wide range but is believed to be an uncommon species. Nevertheless, besides its forest home it has adapted to many disturbed and man-made habitats, including the thatched roofs of houses, and one female was found nursing young in the drawer of a piece of furniture.

Storylines Backstory Patrick was born in September 18, 1976Celebrated his birthday on-screen September 18, 2015.Revealed to be 37 years old on June 25, 2014. and grew up the only child of Noah (Rick Springfield) and Mattie Drake. He had a close relationship with both his parents and idolized his father, a successful surgeon. His mother was involved in an accident and his father operated on her. There were complications and she ended up dying on the table. Noah had a breakdown and became an alcoholic. Patrick did not have contact with his father for several years.  2005‚Äì2009  Dr. Patrick Drake comes to Port Charles when Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) needs surgery. Because his father Dr. Noah Drake could not perform the operation, Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough) seeks Patrick out. Initially refusing, he agrees after Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) and Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) cast aspersions on his abilities as a surgeon. He soon begins seeing Robin but has flings with Carly, who uses him as a way of making Robin jealous. He constantly flirts with many of the hospital's nurses. After months of casually dating Robin, Patrick is exposed to HIV while performing surgery on a patient with AIDS. Robin helps in through the time in between his blood tests and they grow closer. Patrick admits his love to Robin after she makes an unrequested suggestion during a surgery. They are relieved six months later when Patrick is officially proven HIV-negative. Robin voices her desire for children and a family, but Patrick doesn't want one. The two have a one- night stand on Georgie Jones' (Lindze Letherman) funeral night and Robin realizes she became pregnant after the police and mob found out that Georgie was strangled by Diego Alcazar (Ignacio Serricchio). Patrick, who thinks Robin had gone to a sperm bank, discovers that she is carrying his child. With the help of Robin's mother, Anna Devane (Finola Hughes), Patrick proposes, which Robin refused. Weeks after learning they are having a daughter, Patrick and Robin attempt to wed on October 29, 2008 but after Robin goes into labour, she is admitted to the hospital, giving birth to Emma Grace Scorpio-Drake. Patrick discovers his father had another son, Matt Hunter (Jason Cook), who is a doctor at General Hospital. The two brothers bond, and Matt serves as the best man at Robin and Patrick's wedding on December 26, 2008. Robin and Patrick face issues early on in their marriage, such as Robin's post-partum depression and the murder of the mayor's mistress that lead to Patrick being accused of medical malpractice. Patrick's ex-girlfriend from college, Lisa Niles (Brianna Brown), appears in town on a consult with Robin. She later transfers to General Hospital for a change of setting. Robin initially is apprehensive about this, but when Lisa loses a patient, she comforts her into believing she's not perfect. Robin and Emma leave on a trip to London to see Anna, and Patrick stays behind, though he misses both Robin and Emma everyday. When he helps Lisa move into her new apartment, he realizes that she's making a play for him, and ends her hopes of getting back together with him when he tells her that he loves Robin, and nothing will change that. Patrick and Robin begin to have a strained marriage afterwards during the trial of Robin's friend, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), for the murder of his wife, Claudia (Sarah Brown), as the well as the revelation that Sonny's son, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna), was working undercover to bring Sonny down and then Sonny's niece Molly Lansing (Haley Pullos) framed Michael Corinthos (Drew Garrett) for that because Michael did it. When Robin leaves for Africa on assignment, Patrick sleeps with Lisa, and immediately regrets it. Lisa, though, becomes unhinged and hell-bent on breaking up Robin and Patrick's marriage after their one-night stand, intent on getting Patrick for herself. She tries to portray Robin as paranoid and crazy, and even uses Emma in a play for Patrick. Patrick eventually confesses his affair to Robin, separating them. Patrick desperately tries to save his marriage, and though they slowly start making amends, Robin is not ready to trust him again. Lisa still tries to make a play for Patrick, and ends up putting both Robin and Emma in danger. They try to fool Lisa into believing they're breaking up, but she figures out their scheme. Robin and Patrick finally reconcile after Elizabeth Webber's (Rebecca Herbst) son, Jake, dies in a hit-and-run, despite Robin and Patrick trying to save him. Lisa later targets both Robin and Patrick, intending to destroy both of them once and for all. Robin and Patrick, though, figure out her schemes and get her caught in the act, leading to her being arrested. She breaks out of jail and targets them both during a hospital lockdown. She ends up in a coma after injecting herself with a toxic substance. Unknown to Patrick or Robin, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) revives her and then lets her loose to terrorize Port Charles. She targets Patrick and Robin on a yacht, where they're holding a party for Matt. Lisa goes missing, and later ends up dead. Patrick is suspected as the killer, but it's later proven to be Matt, who agrees to a plea bargain and is sent to prison.  2010‚Äì16  After Robin died in an explosion at the hospital labs, Patrick received what he thought were Robin's ashes, and he took them to the plot of land that they were going to build their dream home on to say goodbye to her. At the same time that Patrick is saying goodbye, Robin is shown to be very much alive and held captive in an undisclosed location. Patrick falls into the early stages of addiction to a hallucinogenic pain-killer. Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman) and Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) eventually intervene and get him to detox. Patrick befriends nursing student Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo), but dates Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud), a fellow doctor. Britt rubbed Emma the wrong way, and Patrick would later overhear Britt insulting Emma; he immediately broke up with her. Patrick would help Sabrina revive the Nurses' Ball to honor Robin. The two would eventually start dating during the event. Britt revealed she was pregnant at the Ball. Doubts about the paternity of Britt's baby are raised by Patrick. A paternity test showed that Britt is carrying Patrick's child; however, it is revealed through a conversation between Britt and her mother, Dr. Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati), that the baby is not Patrick's because Obrecht tampered with the test. Patrick later finds out that Britt's mother is working with Cesar Faison (Anders Hove), a man who has targeted Robin's family and also trying to get revenge on Sonny Corinthos, and Britt was arrested as her accomplice. Patrick confronts Britt after she's released, and tells Britt that he's taking full custody of their child, and Britt finally admits that she's not carrying Patrick's baby. Patrick is visibly hurt by this. He has other issues to deal with, though, when Sabrina's ex-boyfriend, Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), comes to town wanting Sabrina back. Patrick decides to move on with Sabrina when he proposes to her, and she accepts. Meanwhile, Robin gets back to Port Charles, but is held in captivity. Patrick got a visit from Ava (Maura West) who tells him that Carlos saw Robin alive. She is finally rescued by her parents, and Patrick is reunited with his wife at his wedding to Sabrina. Though initially conflicted, Patrick eventually decides to stay with Robin. Patrick thinks about having another baby, though Robin declines, and Patrick agrees to let the discussion go. Soon after, Patrick and Robin learn that Sabrina is pregnant. When he confronts her about this, Sabrina tells him that Carlos is the baby's father. Later, Patrick finds out Obrecht has been hired as the new chief of staff, and is furious she got away with hurting Robin. Meanwhile, Sabrina admits to Patrick that she lied, and he is the father of her baby after Robin left Port Charles again. On April 16, 2014 Patrick and Sabrina find out that they are having a boy. On April 25, Sabrina, Patrick and Emma were involved in a car accident which caused Sabrina to go into labor and deliver their son. They were rushed to the hospital after the birth and Heather Webber (Robin Mattson)'s arrest. On May 27, 2014, Patrick and Sabrina name their son. The boy was named Gabriel Drake Santiago, named for his maternal grandmother, his father and his half-sister. After the baby came too early, he died of massive organ failure due to necrotizing enterocolitis. He and Sam found out the car that drove Patrick and Sabrina off the road belonged to Silas Clay (Michael Easton), but Silas didn't do it. Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) was responsible. Rafe went on the run to evade police and got into a crash injuring both Molly and himself, not even Molly's cousins Michael (Chad Duell) nor Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) could've stopped Rafe before the crash happened. Patrick is forced to operate on Rafe, but Rafe doesn't make it. Patrick is fired because of a struggle with his conscience during surgery and he later learns someone put Rafe up to running his family off the road.

This shark is grey-brown in color, with black spots scattered on the fins and body. It has a cylindrical trunk, conical head, and small spiracles behind the eyes. The snout of the Mexican hornshark is very round and blunt. Like all members of the order Heterodontiformes, this shark has fin spines in front of both of its dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin originates before the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal fin originates behind the pelvic fins. The Mexican hornshark reaches a maximum length around 70 cm, but usually reaches between 50 and 60 cm on average. Young hornsharks hatch around 14 cm. Habitat and range Jaws Mexican hornsharks are distributed throughout the coast of the Eastern Pacific, mainly around southern Baja California, and possibly as far south as Peru. The rocky bottoms, coral reefs, and sandy areas of the littoral zone create the habitat of this hornshark. The Mexican hornshark can be found at a maximum depth of 50 m, but is usually found down to 20 m. Behavior Like all members of the order Heterodontiformes, the Mexican hornshark is oviparous. After an unknown gestation period, the female attaches an unknown number of spiral-shaped egg cases to rocks on the sea floor. The length of the incubation period of these egg cases is also unknown. Not much about the feeding habits of the Mexican hornshark is known, but it most likely feeds on shelled invertebrates. Because of its size, this shark poses no danger to humans. Conservation Because of its recent discovery and lack of research, the Mexican hornshark is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN Red List. This shark is not considered to have commercial value, but it is at risk nonetheless because it is taken as bycatch by fishing operations that use bottom gillnets. Mexican hornsharks caught as bycatch are either discarded or used in fishmeal. If released back into the water, these sharks are hardy enough to survive, but unfortunately many discarded hornsharks are left on beaches to die. Overall, the threat to Mexican hornsharks is considerable, as their range is restricted and they are frequently caught.

It is found in the cerrado of Brazil. Description The cerrado mouse has a head-and-body length of more than and is larger than the only other species in the genus, the hairy-eared cerrado mouse (Thalpomys lasiotis). The fur is dense and rather stiff. The general colouring resembles some members of the Oligoryzomys genus. The dorsal pelage is reddish-brown, the individual hairs having blackish bases, orange central sections and blackish tips. There are also longer black guard hairs. The flanks and underparts are paler. The chin is buff and the eye-ring and cheeks orangish. The upper surfaces of the hindfeet are buff; they are small, with short outer toes and tiny claws. The tail, which is well-haired, is brown above and buff below. The diploid number is 36. Distribution and habitat This mouse is restricted to the cerrado ecoregion in Brazil, occurring in the states of Bahia, Goi√°s and Mato Grosso. It inhabits open grassland, savannah with occasional trees and wetter grassland areas with palms. It readily recolonises areas affected by wildfires, and is at its most numerous less than two years later. Ecology The cerrado mouse is most active soon after dusk and in the hours before dawn. In the state of Bahia, it is hardly ever caught in the live traps used by researchers for surveying small mammals, but its presence in the area is confirmed by its abundance in barn owl pellets (the undigested parts of their prey that the owls regurgitate). Status This mouse has a wide range but a rather patchy distribution. The cerrado grassland in which it lives is increasingly being threatened by the expansion of industrial-scale farming, the burning of vegetation for charcoal and the development of dams to provide irrigation. Although the population of the mouse may be in general decline, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern because it believes the rate of population decline is not fast enough to justify placing it in a more threatened category.

Biography Patrick Scales was born in a small town in the Bavarian Alps. As the town was a recreation area for the American army, there were many clubs with live music around. Patrick could often listen to a big variety of music. From bluegrass to rock, soul music and jazz everything was present. At the age of 12 he was taking up classical guitar lessons with his teacher Jeffrey Ashton. For his 14th birthday he got an electric bass and because of the recommendations of his teacher Wayne Martin, half a year later he started playing gigs regularly in army clubs with musicians twice his age. After finishing school he and his brother Martin Scales (guitar) decided to visit the U.S.A. to play music and study for a period of time. 1989 Patrick moved to Munich, where he started gigging with bands in all kinds of musical fields. He was touring with the New York blues guitar player Jonathan Kalb, the avant- garde jazz band Brother Virus (CD: Live at the Knitting Factory-New York; Enja records-1991), the Brazilian band Coisa Nostra and others. 1993 Patrick and his brother Martin recorded their debut album SCALSENDERS together with their old friend Johannes Enders. 1994 Patrick joined Klaus Doldinger¬¥s band Passport, where he is playing since and has recorded 5 CDs with. 1996 Patrick started teaching at the Music University of Mannheim. He played bass on the CD \\"A new shift\\" of Pee Wee Ellis. 1997 the CD Scales Brothers ‚ÄúOur House‚Äù was released at Enja Records. 1999 Patrick began to teach at the Richard Strauss Conservatory in Munich. 2000 the CD Scales ‚ÄúGrounded‚Äù was released at Blue Note Records. 2004 the book \\"A Rhythmic Concept For Fusion / Funk\\" (Advance Music) by Peter O'Mara and Patrick Scales was released. 2008 Patrick became teacher at the University of Music and Performing Arts Munich.

However, recent taxonomic revisions, based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, have split this widely distributed species into three separate species (S. hispidus, S. toltecus, and S. hirsutus). The southern edge of the S. hispidus distribution is likely near the Rio Grande, where it meets the northern distribution of S. toltecus (formerly S. h. toltecus).Carroll, D. S., L. L. Peppers, and R. D. Bradley. 2004. Molecular systematics and phylogeography of the Sigmodon hispidus species group. pp. 85‚Äì98, in Contribuciones Mastozoologicas en Homenaje a Bernardo Villa (Sanchez-Cordero V. y R. A. Medellin Eds.) Instituto de Biologia e Instituto de Ecologia, UNAM, Mexico. The northern extent of S. hispidus distribution is to the Platte River in Nebraska and from Arizona to Virginia. Adult size is total length 202‚Äì340 mm (7.9‚Äì13 in); tail 87‚Äì122 mm (3.4-4.8 in), frequently broken or stubbed; hind foot 29‚Äì35 mm (1-1.3 in); ear 16‚Äì20 mm (0.6-0.9 in); mass 50-250 g (1.7-9 oz). They have been used as laboratory animals. Taxonomy The currently accepted scientific name for the hispid cotton rat is Sigmodon hispidus Say and Ord. It is a member of the family Cricetidae.(Animal Diversity Web, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology). Although 25 subspecies are accepted, including the type subspecies, the most distinct genetic subdivision within S. hispidus separates the species into two genetic lineages, an eastern one and a western one, which hybridize along a contact zone. Distribution In the United States, the hispid cotton rat ranges from southern Virginia and North Carolina (especially the coastal plain) west through Tennessee, northern Missouri, Kansas, and extreme southern Nebraska to southeastern Colorado, New Mexico, and southeastern Arizona; south to the Gulf Coast; and south to northern Mexico.Hall, E. Raymond. 1981. The mammals of North America. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. New York: John Wiley and Sons It does not occur on the coastal plain of North Carolina nor in the mountains of Virginia. Disjunct populations occur in southeastern Arizona and extreme southeastern California into Baja California Norte. In Kansas, it appeared within the last 50 years. Habitat Hispid cotton rats occupy a wide variety of habitats within their range, but are not randomly distributed among microhabitats. They are strongly associated with grassy patches with some shrub overstory and they have little or no affinity for dicot-dominated patches. Habitat use and preference by hispid cotton rats usually appear to depend on the density of monocots. However, some studies are equivocal on the importance of other vegetation. For example, hispid cotton rats may respond favorably to a high percentage of dicots in a stand if cover remains optimal. In Kansas, hispid cotton rats increased on root-plowed prairie that experienced an increase in the diversity and biomass of early successional forbs. Male hispid cotton rats exhibit a lower degree of habitat selectivity than females. In Texas, males were found on different habitat types (grassy, shrubby, and mixed) about in proportion to availability; females tended to choose mixed habitats more often than expected based on availability. Habitat use varies with season and breeding status. In Texas, grassy areas with some shrubs were preferred in spring and areas with more shrubby cover were preferred in fall. In Kansas, remnant prairie the preferred habitat of hispid cotton rats has dense undergrowth and an upper layer of protective vegetation such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)/kochia (Kochia scoparia)/annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus).Fleharty, Eugene D. 1972. Some aspects of small mammal ecology in a Kansas remnant prairie. In: Zimmerman, James H., ed. Proceedings, 2nd Midwest prairie conference; 1970 September 18‚Äì20; Madison, WI. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Arboretum: 97‚Äì103 Hispid cotton rats prefer grassy clearings, croplands, overgrown fields, and overgrown roadsides and right-of-ways. In Kansas prairies hispid cotton rats occur at relatively high abundance in ungrazed uplands and sandy mixed-grass native prairie, but also prefer disturbed areas. The use of disturbed areas was probably important in the recent invasion of hispid cotton rats into north-central Kansas from the northern presettlement limit of their range in Oklahoma.Kaufman, Donald W.; Finck, Elmer J.; Kaufman, Glennis A. 1990. Small mammals and grassland fires. In: Collins, Scott L.; Wallace, Linda L., eds. Fire in North American tallgrass prairies. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press: 46‚Äì80 On Texas rangelands, hispid cotton rats appeared to respond to increased biomass of standing crop and increases in the proportion of the standing crop in potential food plants such as bristlegrasses (Setaria spp.). Rat density was four times greater on areas planted to exotic grasses including King Range bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) and buffel grass (Enchrus ciliaris) than on native range dominated by windmill grass (Chloris spp.) and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). In northeastern Kansas, hispid cotton rats occurred at high population densities in tallgrass prairie (dominated by perennial grasses); population density declined to levels too low to accurately estimate over 28 years of succession to brush and trees.Fitch, Henry S.; Kettle, W. Dean. 1983. Ecological succession in vegetation and small mammal populations on a natural area of northeastern Kansas. In: Kucera, Clair L., ed. Proceedings, 7th North American prairie conference; 1980 August 4‚Äì6; Springfield, MO. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri: 117‚Äì121 They are occasionally found in habitats dominated by early successional grassland species (i.e., annual grasses and forbs).Dickson, James G.; Williamson, J.

Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station: 375‚Äì378 Hispid cotton rats occur in grassy areas or early- successional habitats within open woods. In the Southeast hispid cotton rat population density increases with the density of broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus) and other low growing plants, but declines with succession to brush and trees. In Texas pine-hardwood forests, hispid cotton rats were captured most often in narrow streamside management zones which have more light and thus more ground cover, and slightly less often in wider zones. In longleaf pine-slash pine stands of central Louisiana hispid cotton rats were captured in sawtimber, sapling, and regeneration stands but not in pole-sized timber; stands with surface cover were more likely to support hispid cotton rats. Pole-sized timber is dense, little light reaches the ground, and surface cover is minimal.Mullin, Keith; Williams, Kenneth L. 1987. Mammals of longleaf-slash pine stands in central Louisiana.

New Orleans, LA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Forest Experiment Station: 121‚Äì124 In Louisiana and Mississippi, hispid cotton rats were more numerous in cut than in uncut bottomland hardwoods. They were also more numerous in cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantations than in uncut cottonwood stands. In northern Georgia intensive site preparation following clearcutting of pine-hardwood mixtures increases forage production and increased numbers of small mammals (presumably including hispid cotton rats).Evans, Timothy L.; Waldrop, Thomas A.; Guynn, David C., Jr. 1991. Fell-and-burn regeneration in the North Georgia piedmont: effects on wildlife habitat and small mammals. Proceedings, Annual Conference of Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 45: 104‚Äì114 In Colorado, hispid cotton rats occupy semimoist areas with abundant grasses and weeds and appear to be restricted to relatively warm areas.Lechleitner, R. R. 1969. Wild mammals of Colorado. Boulder, CO: Pruett Publishing Company In New Mexico, hispid cotton rats do not occur regularly in areas with a mean annual temperature lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 ¬∞C) and a growing season shorter than 180 days. In Trans-Pecos, Texas, hispid cotton rats occur at the warmer, low elevations in areas of moderate to dense grassy cover.Schmidly, David J. 1977. The mammals of Trans-Pecos Texas: including Big Bend National Park and Guadalupe Mountains National Park. College Station, TX: Texas A&M; University When water and wastewater are added to baldcypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) domes, small mammals including hispid cotton rat move to peripheral areas that are drier. The rising water tables favor marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) over hispid cotton rats. Cameron and McClure compiled reports of hispid cotton rat population densities. The mean hispid cotton rat population density range for all studies was 5.3 to 31.1 rats per hectare. Population density ranges in Texas include 1 to 14 rats per hectare in coastal prairie, 17 to 84 rats per hectare in unmowed right-of-ways, 9 to 29 rats per hectare in old fields, 6 to 54 rats per hectare in abandoned fields, and 0.7 to 5 rats per hectare in grass-prickly-pear (Opuntia spp.). In Florida population density ranges include 0 to 24 rats per hectare in sand pine scrub, 2 to 47 rats per hectare in pine flatwoods, and 27 to 94 rats per hectare in tropical hammock. In Kansas hispid cotton rat density ranges were 0.2 to 21 rats per hectare in grassland;Cameron, Guy N.; McClure, Polley A. 1988. Geographic variation in life history traits of the Hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus). In: Boyce, Mark S., ed. Evolution of life histories of mammals: theory and pattern. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press: 33‚Äì64 the highest estimated density was 65.4 hispid cotton rats per hectare in favored habitat. In a study of the effects of habitat patchiness on movement, hispid cotton rats preferred only the largest patches which were by 330 feet (50√ó100 m). Patches were established by mowing strips between blocks of grasses. Hispid cotton rats were present in intermediate numbers on medium-sized patches which were 39.6 feet by 79.2 feet (12√ó24 m), but were so scarce on the smallest patches that their movement pattern could not be analyzed. In Kansas remnant prairie, the average annual home range of adult male hispid cotton rat was estimated as 0.969 acre (0.39 ha) and that of adult females as 0.543 acre (0.21 ha). The greatest distance traveled by an adult male was 330 feet (100 m) and by an adult female was 250.9 feet (76.4 m). In Texas male hispid cotton rats also had larger home ranges than females. Home ranges were larger in summer and winter than in spring and fall. Home range size was positively correlated with body mass and negatively correlated with population density. There was a relatively high degree of exclusivity (41%), indicating intolerance of conspecifics, particularly of the same sex. In Texas hispid cotton rats found their original home ranges (homed) from displacements of up to 5,000 feet (1,500 m). Returns were relatively high from displacements of up to 990 feet (300 m), suggesting that hispid cotton rats are familiar with the area within that distance. Hispid cotton rats released in areas with no cover homed better than hispid cotton rats released in typical hispid cotton rat habitat. Spencer and others used site fidelity as a measure of an individual's actual home range and concluded that hispid cotton rats have both single-day and multiday site fidelity and therefore establish true home ranges. Cover requirements On the southern Coastal Plain, hispid cotton rats use gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrows for shelter in sandhill scrub dominated by longleaf pine, bluejack oak (Quercus incana) and sand post oak (Q. stellata ssp. margaretta).Landers, J.

Larry. 1987. Prescribed burning for managing wildlife in southeastern pine forests. In: Dickson, James G.; Maughan, O. Eugene, eds. Managing southern forests for wildlife and fish: a proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. SO-65. New Orleans, LA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Forest Experiment Station: 19‚Äì27 In Florida, sand pine (P. clausa) scrub has been invaded by hispid cotton rats for short periods. Reasons for the invasion were not clear, but were probably related to increased population densities in nearby optimum habitat (pine flatwoods with a dense ground cover of grasses and herbs). Sand pine scrub has little ground cover and is marginal habitat for hispid cotton rats. Behavior and biology Hispid cotton rats are mainly nocturnal, but activity has been observed at all hours. Activity patterns appear to be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors.They are active year-round. Populations usually exhibit a bimodal breeding season, with peak litter production occurring in late spring and late summer-early fall. Reproductive peaks in March and June for hispid cotton rats; all trapped females were pregnant from March through July, but none was breeding in November and December. They do not breed in the coldest winter months. In Kansas, breeding is restricted to the frost-free months. A nest is constructed by the female either on the ground surface or in a burrow. Nests are cup- to ball-shaped and woven of grasses. Hispid cotton rats in the northern parts of their range makethicker and denser nests, but not larger, than those of southern hispid cotton rats. Gestation in hispid cotton rats lasts about 27 days. Litter sizes range from one to 15 young, with larger litters more typical of northern populations and also of late-season litters. Neonates are well developed; they are mobile and lightly furred, but their eyes are not open. The eyes open around 18 to 36 hours after birth. They are weaned in 10 to 15 days and reach minimum adult size by about 41 days. Some male hispid cotton rats are sexually mature by 60 days; some females are receptive by 30 to 40 days. The earliest recorded pregnancy was at 38 days. These rats have been noted as one of the most prolific mammals in the Southeast. Females bear two to several litters per year depending on latitude and local weather. Females mate within 24 hours of giving birth. Hispid cotton rat populations are largely sedentary; population density depends mainly on current reproductive effort and not as strongly on immigration. In Kansas remnant prairie, hispid cotton rat population density was highest in fall and early winter and lowest in spring and early summer. In the northernmost parts of hispid cotton rat range, severe weather is associated with rapid population declines and local extinctions. In Kansas, most mortality was associated with severe weather in March and April. Populations in the northern part of hispid cotton rat range experience dramatic declines in the nonbreeding season. In many areas, local extinction is frequent . In Georgia, their spring abundance in old fields was lowest following drought and extreme winter cold. The reductions in populations were associated with sharp declines in vegetative biomass and cover. In Georgia, a density of 15 hispid cotton rats per acre was considered the predator-limited carrying capacity. Mammalian predators did not have a substantial effect on population density. At densities higher than 15 per acre, mortality was high; below 15 rats per acre, predator-caused mortality was low. When diverse and mobile predators are present, they are more important than food, social interaction, or weather in limiting hispid cotton rat density. Also in Georgia, field enclosures protected from avian predators (covered with a net) were monitored for the effect of avian predators on breeding hispid cotton rat populations. The presence of the cover had no effect on seasonal recruitment or spring-summer mortality; however, autumn-winter mortality was greatly reduced with the cover in place. Avian predators, then, are apparently more important than mammalian predators. In addition, nonbreeding (winter) populations suffer substantial losses from predation, whereas breeding populations are either able to compensate by replacing lost individuals, are less vulnerable to predation, or both. Diet Hispid cotton rats are omnivorous, but the major portion of their diet consists of green vegetation. They occasionally consume insects and other small animals.Whitaker, John O., Jr. 1980. National Audubon Society field guide to North American mammals. New York: Alfred A. Knopf Field observations of hispid cotton rat diet indicate that preferred foods are the stems, foliage, and seeds of crop and wild plants.Martin, Alexander C.; Zim, Herbert S.; Nelson, Arnold L. 1951. American wildlife and plants. New York: McGraw- Hill Book Company GolleyGolley, Frank B. 1962. The mammals of Georgia: a study of their distribution and functional role in the ecosystem. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press reported that in the Southeast, perennial legumes and broomsedge comprised a large portion of the diet of hispid cotton rats. They also consumed roots and tubers. In Texas hispid cotton rat diets always included the lower green stems of grasses (which are relatively low in nutritive value); raspberries (Rubus spp.), privet (Ligustrum spp.) fruits, and leaves of fogfruits (Phyla spp.) were consumed as available. Predators Hispid cotton rats are preyed on by many birds and reptiles, and by other mammals. In Oklahoma hispid cotton rats were a major prey item in the diet of Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni).Bednarz, James C. 1988. Swainson's hawk. In: Glinski, Richard L.; Pendleton, Beth Giron; Moss, Mary Beth; [and others], eds. Proceedings of the southwest raptor management symposium and workshop; 1986 May 21‚Äì24; Tucson, AZ. NWF Scientific and Technical Series No. 11. Washington, DC: National Wildlife Federation: 87‚Äì96 In central Missouri hispid cotton rats comprised 19% of prey items in red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) nests. Hispid cotton rat remains comprised a substantial portion of short- eared owl (Asio flammeus) pellets in Arkansas. Hispid cotton rats were the third most important prey item of red wolves (Canis rufus) in eastern Texas and Louisiana.Shaw, James Harlan. 1975. Ecology, behavior, and systematics of the red wolf (Canis rufus). New Haven, CT: Yale University. Dissertation In North Carolina, bobcats (Lynx rufus) consumed substantial numbers of hispid cotton rats.Miller, S. Douglas; Speake, Dan W. 1978. Prey utilization by bobcats on quail plantations in southern Alabama. Proceedings, Annual Conference of Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 32: 100‚Äì111 Hispid cotton rats were a minor item in the diet of Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi). In north-central Florida the only direct evidence of predation on hispid cotton rats was the presence of hispid cotton rat remains in a barred owl (Strix varia) pellet. The authors also observed a corn snake (Elaphe guttata guttata) killing a hispid cotton rat just after the rat was released from a trap.

Its main offices are located in the Leadenhall Building, London. Previously they were at the Thames Wharf Studios. In its various incarnations it is known for many important buildings including Lloyd's building and the Millennium Dome in London and the National Assembly for Wales building in Cardiff. Description The firm's principal offices are located at Leadenhall Building in London. It also maintains offices in Shanghai and Sydney. the firm has thirteen partners, including Richard Rogers, Graham Stirk and Ivan Harbour. The practice is run with a profit-share scheme and a limit on the directors' salaries in comparison with those of the lowest paid in the office. The previous head office at Thames Wharf Studios, Hammersmith The practice is strongly focused on sustainability, urban regeneration and social awareness, themes that have long been a feature of Rogers' work. Celebration of public space and the encouragement of public activities is also a recurring theme. It is owned by a charitable trust, ensuring that no individual owns any share in its value and preventing private trading and inheritance of shares. The practice divides its profits between all of the staff and their chosen charities, according to publicly declared principles.  History  Soon after the Pompidou Centre in Paris was opened in 1977, Richard Rogers formed the Richard Rogers Partnership and started work on the Lloyd's building in London. Richard Rogers explained the reason for the change of the practice name from the Richard Rogers Partnership to Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners in 2007 was because \\"We wanted to avoid the situation where the name of the practice is someone who died 100 years ago. Architecture is a living thing. If I want to leave something to the future, it has to be able to change ‚Äì but retain something of the ethos that we built up over 50 years.\\" In November 2015 Rogers Stirk Harbour created five new partners including Tracy Meller who became their first woman partner. Founding partner Mike Davies stepped down.  Awards  In 2006 the practice was awarded the Stirling Prize for their Madrid-Barajas Airport, Terminal 4. In 2008, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners was awarded the Manser Medal for Houses and Housing, given for the best one- off house (Oxley Woods) designed by an architect in the UK. In 2009 it was awarded the Stirling Prize for Maggie's Centre in London. It won the RIBA National Award 2015 for NEO Bankside luxury apartments in London and was subsequently shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for the second time.

He has been portrayed off-and-on by actor Ingo Rademacher since 1996. The role was temporarily portrayed by Gideon Emery during Rademacher's absence in January 2008. Jax gained popularity due to the love triangle involving him and supercouple Sonny Corinthos and Brenda Barrett. When Brenda left the show it continued on with Sonny and Carly Benson. Sonny and Jax became mortal enemies due to their frequent affections for the same woman. Jax has left the show numerous times, but for the most part has been a steady presence since his debut.  Casting and character creation  The role of Jasper \\"Jax\\" Jacks was originated by German-born Australian actor Ingo Rademacher who debuted in the role on January 31, 1996. In April 2000, Rademacher announced his decision to not sign a new contract with the series, and would vacate the role of Jasper. On his departure, Rademacher said in a statement, \\"I haven't really built up my resum√©. I think [daytime] was a good move. And especially being on General Hospital, the best daytime show, I think. But there are other things I'd like to do.\\" Following his departure, the actor signed onto the NBC primetime series, Titans. In April 2001, it was rumored that Rademacher would make his way back to General Hospital, despite being interested in the role of \\"Colin\\" on the NBC Daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives, a potential love interest of the character Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves). That month, further speculation led to many to believe that Rademacher would return to his daytime home following the cancellation of Titans and his rumored deal with Days of our Lives failing to provide any truth. It was later confirmed that Rademacher was to return to the series in June 2001. He returned on-screen July 30, 2001. In September 2004, following his being quoted as being \\"burned out\\", Rademacher was rumored to be making an exit from his daytime home once again, however the rumors turned out to be false. In May 2011, it was announced that Rademacher had been fired from the series following a noticeable decline in Jasper's airtime on the series. Rademacher last aired in July 2011, before returning in August in what he stated was expected to be the first of many guest appearances on the series. In November 2011, it was announced by ABC announced that Rademacher would make another scheduled guest appearance on the series, this time lasting three weeks. Rademacher returned on December 30, 2011 and left the series once again on January 23, 2012. In August 2012, following the surprising return of Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©), it was announced that Rademacher would once again make a return to the series in the role of Jasper Jacks. Rademacher made his on-screen return on August 23, 2012. He finished his guest series the following month, making his final appearance on September 26, 2012. Rademacher, along with co-star Vanessa Marcil, was invited back for the show's 50th anniversary. An official announcement was made on March 5, 2013. He appeared back on-screen on April 1, 2013. On June 2, 2016, TVLine broke news that Rademacher would return to the soap under recurring capacity; he was expected to first appear on July 29, but due to preemptions, Rademacher returned on August 1 and departed weeks later on August 16. Rademacher returned yet again from November 10 to 28, 2016. In March 2017, Frank Valentini confirmed that Rademacher would, again, reprise his portrayal as Jasper Jacks. On February 14, 2019, Rademacher announced he would return as Jax in a video shared on social media; he made his first re-appearance during the May 7, 2019, episode.  Storyline   1990s  Jasper \\"Jax\\" Jacks arrives in Port Charles, New York, at the behest of Lois Cerullo (Rena Sofer) to help her get her company back from Edward Quartermaine. Despite Lois's happy marriage to Ned Ashton (Wally Kurth), Jax pursues her romantically. To keep Jax occupied, Lois introduces him to her best friend Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil), who uses Jax to make her mobster ex-boyfriend Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) jealous. Despite her love for Sonny, Brenda develops feelings for Jax, and the two eventually wed on his private yacht. When the two decide to renew their vows, Sonny interrupts the ceremony by bringing in Jax's former wife, Miranda Jamison (Leslie Horan), who revealed her death had been faked to hide scars she suffered in the explosion. Jax ultimately decides to move on with Brenda, who has become engaged to Sonny. Brenda, who has been battling an addiction to pain killers, is left at the altar by Sonny in an attempt to protect her from the dangers of mafia life, and Jax helps her recover from her eventual breakdown. The two become engaged yet again, though Brenda appears to die when her mental mother drives her over a cliff.  2000s  Jax learns that his father and brother Jerry Jacks (played by Julian Stone at the time) started the family empire with mafia money, and they lose all of their wealth. After gambling in Monte Carlo, Jax begins to rebuild his fortune and also meets fashion designer Chloe Morgan (Tava Smiley). Chloe is in danger of losing her design company, and must be happily married to retain the seed money her eccentric uncle left her. She plans to marry a now divorced Ned in Las Vegas, and when Chloe's aunt Gertrude objects, Jax marries his best friend and Ned's love interest Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) to help cover the ruse. Though Chloe eventually loses her company, she and Jax grow closer. Eventually they fall in love and Jax buys her company back. Chloe is severely injured when Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers) runs her over in an attempt to kill Alexis. Chloe develops psychic visions tied to Helena, and Stefan Cassadine (Stephen Nichols) intends to use these to help destroy his devious mother Helena. Stefan shows Jax a woman who looks just like Brenda, and Jax leaves Port Charles in search of his former love. While searching for Brenda, Jax meets Kristina Cassadine (Jaime Ray Newman) and he realizes that she is Alexis's sister and reunites them. Chloe refuses his advances when she learns he left her to pursue Brenda. Stavros Cassadine (Robert Kelker-Kelly) murders Chloe, who has become involved with Stefan, leaving Jax heartbroken. Returning to corporate raiding, Jax teams up with Skye Chandler Quartermaine (Robin Christopher) and her brother (Billy Warlock) to take over ELQ, their family company, and to destroy Sonny. Jax also goes into business with Carly Corinthos (played by Tamara Braun at the time), Sonny's wife, to open a nightclub in an attempt to free her from the mafia lifestyle. Despite initially disliking Skye, Jax becomes attracted to her, and she in turn plays the damsel in distress to lure him to her. They are both concerned when A.J. becomes involved with Sonny's sister Courtney Matthews (Alicia Leigh Willis). The two briefly split when Jax learns that Skye had been working with Edward behind his back, but they are able to overcome this obstacle and marry. The night of his wedding to Skye, Jax is shocked to see a very much alive Brenda in his cottage. Brenda explains that she faked her death, fearing that she suffered from the same fatal mental illness as her mother and that she had been taken in by arms dealer Luis Alcazar (Ted King). When she attempts to leave Luis, he shoots Jax, leaving him paralyzed. Depressed over his condition, Jax pushes Skye away and pretends to be in love with Brenda still. Skye learns that Brenda is not dying, and when Jax discovers that she is keeping this information from Brenda, he ends their marriage. Overjoyed, he tells Brenda the truth, and the two become engaged again. Skye begins drinking again and also starts an affair with Luis. When Luis is murdered, Skye implicates Brenda and mobster Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), forcing Brenda and Jason to marry so they cannot be forced to testify against each other. Initially found guilty, Brenda is cleared of the charges when it is revealed that Alexis killed Luis, who was responsible for the death of Kristina, in order to protect her newborn daughter. Once her marriage to Jason is annulled, Brenda and Jax prepare to wed, though Jax leaves her at the altar when he learns that she kissed Sonny the day of their wedding. Brenda leaves town, and Skye again pursues Jax. Unable to recapture their past love, Skye begs him to impregnate her, but Jax chooses to leave town again. In 2003, Jax returns to town in pursuit of a set of five cards called the Dead Man's Hand, allegedly held by Wild Bill Hickok the night he was killed. Jax's father had them for most of his life, and believed them to be responsible for his success. Upon losing them, his father lost the will to live. As Jax searches, he meets a grifter named Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) who is also searching for the cards. Initially at odds, the two become attracted to each other while simultaneously sabotaging each other's quest. After they become lovers, Sam steals the cards from Jax. He is unable to return them to his father in time to prevent his death, and blames Sam. After some more adventures, they eventually break up and Sam becomes involved with his enemy Sonny Corinthos. Jax reconnects with Sam when he briefly suspects he is the father of her unborn child, but the connection ends when Jax learns that his enemy Sonny is actually the father. Jax begins to flirt with Sonny's sister Courtney, and the two make a ten million dollar bet that she won't be able to resist his sexual advances. Courtney wins the bet, but the two fall in love. Courtney and Jax marry, but learn that Courtney cannot conceive a child. They decide to use Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) as a surrogate, though Courtney regrets this as Jax begins neglecting her in favor of Elizabeth and their child. Courtney in turn begins a friendship with Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) that turns into an affair. Courtney becomes pregnant, and Jax changes the paternity test to say that he is the father. Courtney gives birth to a son and dies shortly afterwards. Carly (now portrayed by Laura Wright), begins to help Jax raise his son, and the two begin dating. Carly discovers that Jax is not the father, but keeps quiet to protect the baby from the Cassadines. Carly's longtime nemesis, Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough), learns the truth and reveals it to Nikolas, Jax is then forced to give him the baby who Nikolas names Spencer Cassadine. Jax and Carly continue their relationship, and eventually become engaged. Their wedding is delayed several times, and Jax is forced to leave town to help his wayward brother Jerry. When Sonny shoots mobster Lorenzo Alcazar (Ted King), Carly marries him to avoid testifying about witnessing the act. After she and Sonny are held hostage at the Metro Court Hotel by the mysterious Mr. Craig, they sleep together and Jax finds out. Jax resolves to fight for Carly, and though initially torn, Carly chooses a life with Jax. Carly and Sonny divorce, and Jax and Carly finally marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Jax learns that Mr. Craig is actually his brother Jerry (now portrayed by Sebastian Roch√©) who has had plastic surgery. Jerry tricks Jax to go out of town, but his plan backfires when Jax is kidnapped by Jerry's former lover Irina. She rapes Jax twice, though he is able to escape and return to his life with Carly. Jax begins a new business venture with fashion editor Kate Howard (played by Megan Ward at the time), who Carly immediately dislikes. Jax learns that Kate is actually Connie Falconeri, Sonny's high school girlfriend, and she begins dating Sonny. Carly's son Michael (Dylan Cash), wanting to protect his family, purchases a gun and accidentally shoots Kate. He runs away, leaving Carly, Jax, and Sonny fearful that he has been kidnapped by Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz), a new mafia boss in Port Charles. Meanwhile, Carly and Jax learn she is pregnant. Michael returns to town, but he and Carly are injured in an explosion. Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst) rescues Carly, who suffers from hypothermia. In the hospital, Anthony's daughter Claudia Zacchara (Sarah Joy Brown) threatens Carly in an attempt to protect her brother Johnny Zacchara (Brandon Barash) from Sonny. The stress causes Carly to lose her baby. Claudia, teamed with Jerry, orders Ian Devlin to kill Sonny but the bullet accidentally hits Michael, leaving him in a permanent coma. On the way to bring Michael to a long-term care facility, Carly and Sonny sleep together, the same night that Kate and Jax, feeling shut out of their partner's lives, share a kiss during a business trip. The two split when Jax learns that Carly slept with Sonny and begin divorce proceedings. Still in love with each other, Jax and Carly reconcile yet again. Sonny marries Claudia in order to take over her family's organization after Kate is shot. Carly decides to host a gala at General Hospital to raise money for research to help Michael and other children suffering brain injuries. Jax returns from a business meeting to discover Carly and the others have been quarantined due to a biotoxin that has been released in the hospital. When a fire begins engulfing the hospital, Jax is able to make several rescue flights. Carly escapes via stairwell, and the two reunite and renew their wedding vows. Jerry fakes his death, and begins sending DVDs to Claudia that reveal her role in Michael's shooting. Carly discovers that she is pregnant, and that the pregnancy is extremely high risk. Jax learns the truth about Claudia's misdeeds, and is stunned when Jerry is revealed to be alive. Michael (now portrayed by Drew Garrett) wakes up after an experimental surgery, but faces anger issues and attitude towards his mother. Sonny learns that Claudia planned the shooting, and Claudia reveals that Jax knew about it and kept it secret from both Carly and Sonny. Claudia then kidnaps a pregnant Carly, who goes into labor and gives birth to daughter Josslyn. Claudia attempts to kidnap the baby, but is bludgeoned to death by Michael. Later, Carly and Jax take the baby home, but Carly, outraged that Jax had known that Claudia and Jerry were behind Michael's shooting all along, throws him out of the house.  2010s  Sonny is put on trial for Claudia's murder, and Jax helps the police build their case by hiring a cutthroat prosecutor and ensuring the police have enough evidence to hold up in trial. However, Michael's guilt is eventually revealed, and, disgusted by the cover- up of everybody, the judge sentences Michael to five years in prison to teach them a lesson. Jax feels guilty for this, feeling like he's no better than Sonny. Michael is eventually released conditionally, but the events start taking its toll on Carly and Jax's marriage. When Brenda returns to town, Jax confides in her about his worries that Sonny will hurt Josslyn or Morgan one day. Meanwhile, Jerry returns to town, on a mission to kidnap Brenda on behalf of a criminal called The Balkan. Though Jax tries to stop him, Brenda ends up getting kidnapped and poisoned by the Balkan after marrying Sonny. Eventually, she is rescued, and Jerry is presumed dead after being shot by the Balkan. Jax is worried about Josslyn one night, and brings her to the hospital, where he and Carly find out Josslyn has kidney cancer. While Jax tries to find alternative methods for cures other than chemotherapy, Carly finds out Elizabeth's son, Jake Spencer, was hit by a car and is brain-dead. Elizabeth and Lucky agree to donate one of Jake's kidney's to Josslyn, and she recovers. Carly and Jax file for a divorce, and get into a heated custody battle for Josslyn. Jax wants full custody of his daughter, believing Sonny poses a threat if Carly has any association with him. He goes to great lengths to secure custody, even paying off a court-appointed mediator to throw the case his way. However, Sonny finds out, and has the mediator set Jax up on assault charges, resulting in the judge giving Carly full custody. He leaves town soon after, but comes back to steal his daughter. He later changes his mind and gives Josslyn back, but when he tries to leave town, Sonny sabotages his plane, angry that Brenda left him after he framed Jax. Jax's plane crashes, and he is presumed dead. However, he manages to sneak out, and gets Skye to help him skip town. He overhears Carly say that she wants to cut Sonny out of her life, and leaves knowing Josslyn is safe with Carly. Jax is seen sporadically by Michael and Carly until he shows up in Port Charles when Carly contacts him after Josslyn is hospitalized with a strange illness. Jax comes back in time to see Josslyn recover and find out Jerry has poisoned the Port Charles water supply in order to gain a ransom. He inoculated Josslyn against the poison, and tried to keep Jax away by having him detained at the airport. Jax, though, found his way to Port Charles, and helps pay the ransom Jerry demands in order to get the cure. Jax tries to detain Jerry, but he is presumed dead in an explosion. Jax gets cured, and leaves town. He comes back for the Nurses' Ball being held in honor of Robin, and lets Carly know their divorce was never finalized. He reveals he's now engaged to Brenda, but Carly believes Brenda is still holding onto Sonny. Carly hands Jax their divorce papers, but also lets him know Brenda went to see Sonny, though Brenda claimed she didn't.
