Born in Preston he appeared for Crewe Alexandra, Preston North End and Sheffield United. ==Playing careerClub career=== Dobson made his senior debut for Crewe Alexandra in the Football Alliance, scoring in his first game against Walsall Swifts in September 1889. After one season with Crewe he moved to his home town club of Preston North End in the summer of 1890. It was with Preston that he made his Football League debut; a 3–1 victory over Derby County on 20 September 1889; again scoring in his first game. In the spring of 1891, Dobson was one of three players signed at the instigation of Sheffield United chairman Charles Stokes who wished to use the club's relative financial power to build a strong professional team capable of success in league football. Dobson's first competitive game for The Blades came on 23 March 1891 in a 2–2 draw with Burton Wanderers. Considered a fine shot, Dobson was a regular during the 1891–92 season during which United competed in the Northern League and appeared in The Blades' first ever Football League game the following season. His appearances became more infrequent however and his last game came in October 1893. It is thought that United retained Dobson's registration until 1895, but he had retired through injury and returned to Preston where he became a groundsman at Deepdale. ===International career=== Dobson was selected for an England trial in February 1892 but did not attend due to illness. ==Professional Baseball== In 1890 Dobson played professional baseball for Preston North End in the National League of Baseball of Great Britain. ==Honours== Sheffield United *Football League Division Two **Runner-up: 1892–93 ==References== Category:People from Preston, Lancashire Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:English Football League players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Midland Football League players Category:Northern Football League players Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Samuel Dobson"},{"id":"35847960","text":"Nubemhat (nbw-m-ḥ3t, Gold is at the front, Gold is a name for HathorPersönennamen, pp.10–191) was an ancient Egyptian queen of the Second Intermediate Period.

The site has the best areas of mature sessile oak which remain in Dymock Forest. These sessile oak plantations have developed a high forest structure. Dymock Forest is important for invertebrates such as moths and butterflies. The woods are on draining acidic soils which are derived from Old Red Sandstone. Streams cut through this sandstone to the underlying Silurian rocks.Natural England SSSI information on the citation ===Trees=== The woodland (acidic areas) is dominated by sessile oak with silver birch and wild cherry. Wild service-tree is found throughout the site. The understorey is mostly hazel with hawthorn and holly. The woodland along the streams is mostly sessile oak and, locally, alder. Small-leaved lime and ash may be found. The understory is mostly hazel, and wild privet and dogwood may be found. ===Ground flora=== The ground flora is mostly bramble and bracken. Typical woodland species such as bluebell, wood anemone and yellow archangel flower, together with heather, bilberry and common cow-wheat. The ground flora along the streams is mostly dog's mercury with woodruff and sanicle. Wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus) is a particular feature of the woods in early spring. Other locally uncommon species include bitter-vetch, tutsan and lily-of-the-valley. ===Invertebrates=== Dymock Forest is important for butterflies and moths. The pearl-bordered fritillary and wood white occur as well as the uncommon white admiral. Other recordings include great oak beauty and satin lutestring. Other scarce moths are associated with particular woodland herbs. ==Betty Daw's Wood== * Natural England information on Betty Daw's Wood Daffodil Way Trail Daffodil Way approaching Dymock ===Site=== Betty Daw's Wood lies two miles north-east of Newent, has been unaffected by conifer planting and remains entirely 'semi—natural'. It was taken into Crown ownership at the outbreak of the First World War and has been managed by the Forestry Commission since 1919. The wood, including an area called Colonel's Grove to the east, has been a Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust reserve since 1967. The wood was originally managed as coppice for charcoal, and became high forest, with sessile oak, in the 1850s.2011, 'Nature Reserve Guide', Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust ===Trees=== The large sessile oaks date from about 1850. Those in Colonel's Grove were felled in 1920, and this part of the wood was replanted with ash and beech. Also present are wild cherry and wild service-tree and small-leaved lime. The shrub layer is mostly hazel coppice. ===Ground flora=== The wood is particularly known for its flowering of wild daffodils, and forms part of the Wild Daffodil Trail, which offers two particular walks that incorporate a number of sites which have spectacular displays of wild daffodils. The walks incorporate a series of smaller nature reserves including Gwen and Vera's Fields, Ketford Bank and Vell Mill Daffodil Meadow.'The Daffodil Trails', (undated), Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust The ground flora is diverse and includes wood anemone, bitter-vetch, wood-sorrel, bluebell and primrose. ===Nest box scheme=== A nest box scheme which was started by the North Gloucestershire Naturalists' SocietyGloucestershire Naturalists' Society in 1964, has supported the breeding birds. This one of the longest running schemes in Gloucestershire. Recordings show that these have been used by pied flycatcher, spotted flycatcher, nuthatch, wren, treecreeper and marsh tit in particular. Other breeding birds includes dunnock, song thrush and garden warbler. Nightingales can be heard in the wood. ===Mammals and invertebrates=== The hazel coppice provides a good habitat for the common dormouse. Woodland butterflies include white admiral, wood white and silver-washed fritillary. ===Conservation=== Work is done by the Forestry Commission and the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and includes path and ride-widening, coppicing, tree-planting and pond-clearance. Necessary tree thinning is done of the sessile oak, ash and beech. ==Publications== * Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al., 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust' * 'The Daffodil Trails', (undated), Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust ==ReferencesSSSI source== * Natural England SSSI information on the citation * Natural England SSSI information on the Dymock Woods units ==External links== * Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust * Natural England (SSSI information) Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1990 Category:Nature reserves in Gloucestershire Category:Forest of Dean Category:Forests and woodlands of Gloucestershire ","title":"Dymock Woods SSSI"},{"id":"35848039","text":"Vauxhall Ellesmere Port is a motor vehicle assembly plant, located in the town of Ellesmere Port, south of the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire, England. It has always built small/medium Vauxhall/Opel vehicles, beginning with the Vauxhall Viva, and is now one of two plants in Europe building the Opel Astra. ==Background== In 1070, William the Conqueror granted the lands of Hooton adjoining the River Mersey to Adam de Aldithly. Eventually they passed to the Stanley family through a series of marriages. After the Battle of Bosworth, Hooton had a new hall and the first Lord Derby in Lancashire. A second half- timbered hall was built in 1488. A third Italian-style hall was constructed circa 1778, but this later sold to cover the Stanley family’s gambling debts in 1850. The hall was bought by a Mr. Naylor, a wealthy Liverpool banker, for 82,000 guineas. ===RAF Hooton Park=== British participation in World War I was declared on 4 August 1914. The British War Department requisitioned the estate for use as an army training ground. Allocating the site to the Royal Flying Corps as a training aerodrome for pilots, the War Department built one single and three double aircraft hangars, which were completed in 1917. The airfield closed in 1957 after the disbandment of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, with the site sold to Vauxhall Motors. ==History== The former RAF site was bought by Vauxhall Motors, who developed their plant as a sub-assembly and engine production centre to supply their existing Dunstable and Luton factories. The first plant director, American Tom Williams, was already familiar with the site from his days as a World War II pilot in the US Air Force. The first components flowed off the production line in November 1962. However, the site was quickly developed as the small-car production centre, with the first Vauxhall Viva rolling off of the new assembly line in June 1964. What became known locally as the North Road factory has been responsible since for building all of the successive models, including from 1975 all variants of the Vauxhall Chevette. Employment at the plant peaked that year, at 12,000. In 1980, the plant exported the first Opel badged cars from the UK, with 2,000 Ellesmere Port-built Chevettes exported for sale in West Germany through the Opel dealer network. After the launch of the Vauxhall Astra in 1981, a further £65M investment in 1984 allowed commencement of the second generation Astra. After the consolidation of the European management, design functions and vehicle models in 1986 of the Opel and Vauxhall companies under parent company General Motors Europe, over half of the production output of the plant has been exported. For much of its existence thereon within the Opel/Vauxhall production network, Ellesmere Port has been the sister facility to Opel's Bochum plant in Germany; from the 1973 Opel Kadett C onward, the two factories have been the lead plants for the Kadett/Astra platform through the last six model generations. Following Bochum's closure in 2014, Ellesmere Port became the sole lead plant for the Astra K, which was released in 2016. In 1996, it was the first car plant in the world to be certified for its environmental management systems. == Current vehicle built at Ellesmere Port == Opel/Vauxhall Astra (1991 - present) == Former cars built at Ellesmere Port == Vauxhall Viva (1963 - 1979) Opel/Vauxhall Chevette (1975 - 1984) Opel/Vauxhall Vectra (1995 - 2008) Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra (1979 - 1991) Opel Kadett Combo/Bedford Astramax/Vauxhall Astramax (1986 - 1994) ==Present== As of 2019, the plant employs about 1,100 people, still producing the current model Opel/Vauxhall Astra. There had been fears that the plant could close in 2014, as the new Astra model comes into production in 2015. However, compared to its sister site, Bochum, Ellesmere Port in 2012 was reported to be producing 47 cars an hour over two shifts a day (a company record), while Bochum was producing 30 cars an hour over three shifts a day. In May 2012 the announcement was made that as a result of its commitment to new operating practices Ellesmere Port had been awarded the contract to produce the new Astra from 2015 alongside Opel's Gliwice (Poland) plant, securing the existing 2,100 jobs with a possibility of adding a further 700 jobs to allow for a 51-week/3-shift production pattern. The awarding of the Astra contract carried a contractual obligation to improve operator performance (to the same level as Gliwice's \`ILO 100\` workrate) which would close the overall productivity gap to Opel's Bochum plant. Although Bochum had superior productivity, Ellesmere Port's labour costs were around 20% lower than Bochum. This fact, along with GM Europe's desire to have a hedge for the Euro against the £GBP, resulted in Ellesmere Port securing another 5 years for the future of the plant. Like most automotive plants in Europe, the future for Ellesmere Port remains unsure as substantial over capacity and uncompetitive structural costs remain a threat to Opel/VM as the company searched for new ownership of its entire European operations. In 2018, PSA cut several hundred jobs at the factory amid uncertainty about the future viability of production after Brexit.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43300201https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/vauxhall- job-cuts-losses-ellesmere-port-cheshire-car- maker-a8648661.htmlhttps://europe.autonews.com/article/20181115/ANE/181119828/psa- said-to-mull-closing-vauxhall-factory-post-brexit On 23 November 2018, a strike was held at the plant by all union workers in protest at ongoing job losses.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-46323891 ==Future== The PSA Group plans Ellesmere Port would be one of two factories to build the new Astra in 2021, the Rüsselsheim plant in Germany would also build Opel Astras from 2021. PSA would pull production from the Ellesmere Port plant if Brexit renders the plant unprofitable. It is reported that PSA would build the Astra estate, which represents the bulk of Ellesmere Port production, in Russelsheim from 2022 as 95% of Astra estates are sold on the European Continent. According to PSA, allocation of vehicle to Ellesmere Port continues to be contingent on the terms of the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU, and ensuring that it is a profitable investment. ==Football club== Vauxhall Motors F.C. was founded in 1963, shortly after the opening of the new plant. Early in its history, it played in the Ellesmere Port League and the Wirral Combination, but it soon grew too strong for those leagues. By 1970, the club had achieved several promotions and played on the company-owned Hooton Park. In 1987 it opened its own ground at Rivacre Park, opened by then England manager Bobby Robson, where the club plays today. ==See also== * Opel Eisenach * IBC Vehicles ==References * *Vauxhall UK official website *Ellesmere Port Plant.

The song failed to make an appearance in the UK charts. ==Background== Having returned to the UK from the United States in 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour at the time of the UK's Punk rock explosion. Slade's waning success soon led to the band playing small gigs, including universities and clubs, but despite being successful at filling small venues, their new records were barely selling. \\"Rock 'n' Roll Bolero\\" was released in October 1978 and was one of the band's string of singles to fail to chart during this period.We'll Bring the House Down - 2007 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes \\"Rock 'n' Roll Bolero\\" featured the return of Lea's electric violin; the first time on a Slade single since 1971's \\"Coz I Luv You\\". The song was originally recorded in June 1978 under the working title \\"I've Been Rejected\\". In July, the band re-recorded the song as \\"Rock 'n' Roll Bolero\\" at Portland Studios in London. In a 1979 fan club interview, Lea said of the song: \\"The comment on \\"Rock 'n' Roll Bolero\\" is that it was different for Slade, but it was ordinary compared to everything else that was going around at the time.

He is the frontman of experimental hip hop group Death Grips, and garnered attention for his aggressive rapping style and nihilistic, cryptic, and vulgar lyrics. ==Early life== Stefan Corbin Burnett hails from Sacramento, California. He studied visual art at Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia, but dropped out. ==Career== Burnett began performing under the alias \\"Mxlplx\\", forming a hip hop group called Fyre with his brother (who uses the name Swank Daddy) and another Sacramento-based rapper called Young G.https://web.archive.org/web/20031106161040/http://www.inthecuts.net/mxlplx.html The project came to an end after his brother got married and was unable to continue with the group. During this time, he worked at a pizza restaurant in Sacramento and pursued a career as a painter. In 2010, Burnett took on the name \\"MC Ride\\" and formed Death Grips with his next door neighbor, Zach Hill, who was known for his drumming work with the band Hella and his session work. Hill soon brought friend and producer Andy Morin into the group, and they began working together. In March 2011, Death Grips released their self-titled debut EP. One month later, they released the mixtape Exmilitary, which received critical acclaim and attention from music publications. The group signed to Epic Records in 2012, and released their debut album, The Money Store, soon after. In 2012, the group leaked its second album, No Love Deep Web, due to Epic Records' hesitance to release it until 2013; Epic Records reacted by dropping them from the label. The group subsequently released a third album, titled Government Plates, in 2013. They followed this up with their fourth album, the double album The Powers That B. The first disc, Niggas on the Moon, was released in 2014; every track included vocal samples of Icelandic singer Björk. On July 2, 2014, Death Grips announced their disbandment, stating that \\"Death Grips is over\\". This was followed up with the band's Twitter page posting a photo of the announcement of the break-up written on a napkin. title=Death Grips Break Up  publisher=Pitchfork The group re-emerged in January 2015 with the release of an instrumental soundtrack, Fashion Week. This was followed up with the release of Jenny Death, the second disc of The Powers That B, in March.

The band's sixth studio album, Year of the Snitch, was released in June 2018. In June 2019, Death Grips released a previously unreleased megamix entitled Gmail and the Restraining Orders for Warp Records' 30th anniversary. ==Artistry== MC Ride performing with Death Grips in 2012 Ride's vocal delivery was described as \\"an even more visceral and poetic form of rapping\\" and was compared to \\"a blend of hardcore punk and spoken word performance\\". His style was also described as \\"paint-peeling barks and startling yelps\\". On his review for Death Grips' Exmilitary, Nate Patrin commented on Ride's vocals: \\"Monolithic and harsh, his voice sounds powerful doubling up the beats to the point where it doesn't even seem like a problem when it's halfway buried in the mix.\\" Evan Rytelewski of The A.V. Club described Ride's voice as \\"another instrument of abrasion as he hollers in a voice so tattered and blown-out it must physically pain him\\". Ride's lyrics are described as \\"chants and rants, rhythmic elements that are barely intelligible—though full of bleak, deranged, or drugged-out thoughts\\". Ride's lyrics engage with various topics, including sex, drugs, addiction, economic collapse, insanity, suicide, occultism, paranoia, and techno-futurism. John Calvert of The Quietus wrote, \\"Death Grips embroils MC Ride's consciousness in a schematised Braque-esque maze, a gloaming constellation, a synaptic thing.\\" Chase Woodruff of Slant Magazine argued that Ride's lyrics \\"hint at a contemporary, vaguely political edge to all his rage and alienation\\". James Ubaghs of The Quietus wrote that Ride's \\"paranoid, politically-charged ravings might not present any sort of solution to the world's myriad ills, but he is at the least paying close attention to how fucked things really are, and that's more than you can say for a lot of his contemporaries\\". In a Pitchfork interview, Ride stated that although he has favorite musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, he takes more inspiration from his internal struggles than human achievements. He has a side career as a visual artist. His art consists of dark, monochromatic portraits. His first exhibition took place at Slow Culture in Los Angeles' Chinatown from January 7 to January 28, 2017. ==Personal life== Contrary to his aggressive rap style, Burnett appears to be softly spoken; in a 2012 interview with Spin Magazine, he said, \\"I'm a very private person, I have very few people that I call my friends. I'm very distrustful of human beings in general; I'm very distrustful of media. I have no interest in sharing my personal life with the world. Zero.\\"https://www.spin.com/2012/11/death-grips-artist-year-2012-no-love-deep- web/ He has been described as \\"reclusive\\" and \\"super private\\" by his bandmate Zach Hill, and is quiet and introverted in interviews. ==Discography== *Exmilitary (2011) *The Money Store (2012) *No Love Deep Web (2012) *Government Plates (2013) *The Powers That B (2015) *Bottomless Pit (2016) *Year of the Snitch (2018) ==References* Category:Living people Category:Rappers from Sacramento, California Category:Musicians from Sacramento, California Category:African-American male rappers Category:American experimental musicians Category:American industrial musicians Category:Painters from California Category:African-American artists Category:Hampton University alumni Category:Alternative hip hop musicians Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American painters American Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"MC Ride"},{"id":"35848274","text":"Mount Kagu\\", locus for kunimi in Yamato The ancient Japanese practice of , lit. \\"viewing the realm\\", involved climbing a mountain to survey the land, often before praising it in song.

Quhy Sowld Nocht Allane Honorit Be is an anonymous allegorical poem of the fifteenth or sixteenth century written in Scots.The Bannatyne Manuscript, volume 2 of 4, p. 306-308, Hunterian Club Edition, 1896.A transcript of the poem in David Laing's 'Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland.' Literally the poem recounts the strange life and adventures of a man called \\"Allane\\" who grows from a youth to a powerful adult. Figuratively each of its stanzas also represents an aspect of the production or consumption of ale. Obliquely it describes the cultivation of barley, malting, brewing and the various effects of drinking. \\"Allane\\" is a personification of ale. Although some attention is paid to the undesirable consequences of drunkenness, the tone of the poem is mostly one of praise for the drink. The title, which is also a refrain at the end of each verse, may be translated into English as \\"Why should Allane not be honoured?\\" ==The Text== The text of Quhy Sowld Nocht Allane Honorit Be is found in the Bannatyne Manuscript of the late sixteenth century in which no author is named. The poem is however given the postscript Finis Quod Allane Matsonis Suddartis. This may be translated as End. Thus spoke Allane Maltson's soldiers. ==Synopsis== Quhen he was yung and cled in grene, haifand his air about his ene. Young stalks of barley. \\"Allane\\" is introduced as a youth, \\"Clad in green, with his hair around his eyes.\\" The allusion is to unripe stalks of barley. :Quhen he was yung and cled in grene, :Haifand his air about his ene, :Baith men and wemen did him mene, :Quhen he grew on yon hillis hie, :Quhy sowld nocht Allane honorit be? His \\"foster father\\", the farmer of the barley, visits and finds him \\"lying in a swoon\\". This refers to the drooping heads of mature barley. :His foster faider fure of the toun, :To vissy Allane he maid boun, :He saw him lyand, alace, in swoun, Allane's head \\"begins to split.\\" A nurse is sent for who brings fifty-five \\"Men of War\\" with her. :Thay saw his heid begin to ryfe, :Syne for ane nureis they send belyfe, :Quha brocht with hir fyfty and fyve, :Of men of war full prevely, :Quhy sowld nocht Allane honorit be? In other words, the barley is ripe and harvesting has begun. :Thay rushit furth like hellis rukis, :And every ane of them had hukis, :Thay caucht him schortly in their clukis, After being brought indoors, everyone pledges to stand close to Allane. This may be an allusion to the laborious work of malting and brewing. :Syne every freind made him his band, :Quwill they micht owdir gang or stand, :Nevir ane fute fra him to flee, He saw him lyand, alace, in swoun. Ripe Stalks of Barley. The effects of drinking ale are dealt with in the remaining verses. The themes discussed are, *Dutch courage. \\"The greatest cowart in the land, Frae he with Allane enter in band, Yit forty sall nocht gar him flee\\" *Conviviality. \\"Fra hand to hand so dois he hop, Quhill sum may nowdir speik nor se.\\" *Celebration. \\"In Yule quwen ilk man singis his carrell, gude Allane lyis in to ane barell\\" *Incapacitation. \\"Backwart on the floor fallis he.\\" *Physical side-effects. \\"Upoun their fais he settis his mark, A blude reid nose beside their ee\\". *Expense.

It occurred on the night of 9–10 June 1817. While much of the planning took place in Pentrich, two of the three ringleaders were from South Wingfield and the other was from Sutton in Ashfield; the 'revolution' itself started from Hunt's Barn in South Wingfield, and the only person killed died in Wingfield Park. A gathering of some two or three hundred men (stockingers, quarrymen and iron workers), led by Jeremiah Brandreth ('The Nottingham Captain', an unemployed stockinger), set out from South Wingfield to march to Nottingham. They were lightly armed with pikes, scythes and a few guns, which had been hidden in a quarry in Wingfield Park, and had a set of rather unfocused revolutionary demands, including the wiping out of the National Debt.Cooper, B (1983) Transformation of a Valley: The Derbyshire Derwent Heinemann, republished 1991 Cromford: Scarthin Books However, one among them, William J. Oliver, was a government spy, and the uprising was quashed soon after it began. Three men were hanged and beheaded at Derby Gaol for their participation in the uprising: Jeremiah Brandreth, Isaac Ludlam and William Turner. ==Historical background== Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1816, a number of factors combined to drive the country into a severe depression. The increased industrialisation of the country, combined with the demobilisation of the forces, led to mass unemployment. The Corn Laws led to massive increases in the price of bread, while the repeal of income tax meant that the war debt had to be recovered by taxing commodities forcing their prices even higher. In addition, 1817 was unusually wet and cold, producing a very poor harvest. The loss of production of war materials had affected engineering companies like the Butterley Company, the price of iron ore had slumped, and the production of coal had fallen by a third. The hosiery trade had also been falling away for about five years. There was, in addition, a wider political picture. Since the previous century, there had been calls for parliamentary reform, particularly an end to the rotten boroughs. Subsequently there had been the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror and it appeared that any reform would be accompanied by violence, which Pitt's government set out to pre-empt by increasingly punitive measures. ==Prelude== Since 1811, there had been minor local uprisings, with stocking frames being smashed in protest at the employment of unskilled workers to produce low-quality stockings. Further afield, there had been food riots in many of the big cities. Around the country there were a number of secret revolutionary committees. The one at Nottingham was headed by a needle maker, William Stevens, and its representative from Pentrich was a framework knitter called Thomas Bacon. Bacon was known to have revolutionary views, and was the originator of the Pentrich Hampden Club. Turbutt, G., (1999) A History of Derbyshire, Cardiff: Merton Priory Press, (Vol3 pp1265-1271) Several meetings were held at Pentrich during which Bacon asserted that preparations for an uprising were well advanced, and he had made enquiries at the ironworks and elsewhere about procuring weaponry. The decision to take action was made when news arrived of a revolutionary force heading from the north—a hoax fabricated by William Oliver, a paid informer under the Home Office's instruction. The aim was to join them to march on London in support of a bill by Sir Francis Burdett for parliamentary reform.Turbutt, G., (1999) A History of Derbyshire, Cardiff: Merton Priory Press, (Vol4 p 1491) Bacon was suspected of machinery breaking and, with a warrant out for his arrest, had gone into hiding. He therefore appointed Jeremiah Brandreth, an unemployed stocking knitter with a wife and two children, to be his deputy. Opinion of Brandreth at the time seems to have been somewhat mixed, but he promised the men that they would go to Nottingham, invading Butterley ironworks on the way, where they would kill the three senior managers and ransack it for weapons. At Nottingham they would receive bread, beef and ale, and a sum of money, and they would take over the barracks. They would then proceed by boat down the River Trent and attack Newark. He told them that there were sixteen thousand ready to join them. Among those present were Isaac Ludlam, a bankrupted farmer who owned a small quarry where he had built up a small cache of pikes, and William Turner an ex-soldier. The plan was to assemble at ten o'clock on 8 June, where Ludlam's pikes would be distributed and further weapons would be acquired by requisitioning a man and a gun from each house that they passed. ==The march== At 10 pm on 9 June, around fifty men assembled at Hunt's Barn in South Wingfield and for four hours ranged around the neighbourhood for weapons and extra men. At one house a widow, Mary Hepworth, lived with her two sons. When she refused to open up, the rioters broke a window and Brandreth fired a shot through it, killing a servant. Some of the party were appalled at this wanton act, but Brandreth threatened to shoot them also if they did not remain. Eventually the group set out for the Butterley Company works. When they arrived they were confronted by George Goodwin, the factory agent, who, with a few constables, faced them down. One or two of the party defected and, increasingly demoralised, the remainder headed for Ripley. There was no police force at that time. Order was maintained by the various semi-private armies such as the yeomanry, while intelligence was gathered by the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, from a network formed of local magistrates and paid informers. Through Ripley they pressed more followers into service and at Codnor and Langley Mill they awoke various publicans for beer, bread and cheese. It was now raining heavily and yet more men defected. At Giltbrook they were met by a small force of soldiers: twenty men of the 15th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The revolutionaries scattered and, while about forty were captured, the leaders managed to escape, to be arrested over the following months. ==Retribution== Altogether, eighty-five of the marchers were placed in Nottingham and Derby gaols, to be brought to trial at the County Hall in Derby, charged in the main of \\"maliciously and traitorously [endeavouring]...by force of arms, to subvert and destroy the Government and the Constitution\\". Twenty-three were sentenced, three to transportation for fourteen years and eleven for life. As for the ringleaders, the government was determined to make an example of them, hoping that \\"they could silence the demand for reform by executions for high treason\\". Brandreth was apprehended at Bulwell on 22 July, while Isaac Ludlam was captured in Uttoxeter. Thomas Bacon and his brother John were caught in St.Ives,then in Huntingdonshire, as a result of a £100 reward. The trial was organised by William Lockett, the deputy Clerk of the Peace, who assembled \\"a group of 'respectable' jurors from the farming community on whom he could depend\\". Initially, Bacon, Brandreth and George Weightman (Bacon's brother-in-law) were to stand trial. However, Bacon knew of the part that William Oliver had played, which, had he revealed it, would have embarrassed the government and might have prejudiced the jury in favour of the defendants. Brandreth was therefore tried as the leader, with Turner, Ludlam and Weightman as accomplices. All four were convicted of high treason and sentenced to death. However, Weightman was reprieved due to a recommendation for leniency by the jury, and, with Bacon, was sentenced to transportation for life.

He was noted as a worthy and upstanding citizen. Although the customary quartering was remitted by the Prince Regent, the three were publicly hanged and beheaded at Nuns Green in front of Friar Gate Gaol in Derby. The episode brought no credit to the government and many liberal thinkers of the time were disgusted by the verdicts and the executions. Lord Sidmouth was especially much criticised for his use of Oliver as agent provocateur. Nevertheless, Lockett was able to say that the verdicts of the trial \\"were to have a salutary effect on the behaviour of the 'lower orders' in Pentrich and elsewhere\\". There is little to be seen nowadays of the event, though the martyrs, together with Weightman are commemorated in Giltbrook street names. The hexagonal office, where Goodwin stood his ground, existed in the yard of the Butterley Company's works until it was demolished in 2009/10 along with the rest of the site, and the execution block can be seen by request in Derby Museum. E. P. Thompson in The Making of the English Working Class sees this rising as a transitional event between the earlier Luddite actions and the later populist Radicalism of 1818–20 and 1830–32.

The centre of the populated area is the Catholic mission station. Epukiro had about 3,200 inhabitants in 1997, predominantly ethnic Tswana. Epukiro was since Namibian independence part of Otjinene Constituency. This constituency was split in 2004 and the new Epukiro Constituency was created. ==History== The settlement was formed in 1902 when Roman Catholic Church bought the 30,000 ha farm Epukiro. Namesake of the farm and the settlement is the Epukiro River, an ephemeral river which cuts the farm from west to east. A mission station was founded in 1904 by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a Catholic congregation. It was destroyed one year later during the Herero and Namaqua War. The German colonial administration opened a post office in 1905. The Herero and Namaqua War of 1904–1907 saw tens of thousands of Ovaherero killed, almost its entire population.UN Whitaker Report on Genocide, 1985, paragraphs 14 to 24, pages 5 to 10 Prevent Genocide International Survivors had lost their land and cattle, and the land originally in the hands of the Herero was now farmland in the possession of white settlers. When after World War I Germany lost all its colonies and South-West Africa became mandate territory of South Africa, the new administration was unable, perhaps unwilling, to undo the land transfer. A South African administrator writes: > \\"Seeing that the whole Hereroland was confiscated by the Germans and cut up > into farms and is now settled by Europeans it would be an impossible project > ... to place them back on their tribal lands.\\" To accommodate the Ovaherero, the South African administration created eight \\"native reserves\\" for them of which the Epukiro Reserve was one. The Epukiro Reserve as administrative structure existed until the 1970s. ==People== Epukiro is inhabited by Tswana, Ovambanderu, and San people. Ovambanderu and Herero people share the same ancestry. Herero see the Mbanderu as one of their clans while Mbanderu regard themselves as a distinct group. This difference is the cause of a decades–old rift between the two, with one faction, the Ovambanderu Council of Epukiro and Aminuis seeking recognition of the Mbanderu as a distinct tribe. The other faction aims for a strong and united Herero people under the Tjamuaha-Maharero Royal House and accuses the Mbanderu of artificial division. Today the Ovambanderu Traditional Authority is the heir of the Ovambanderu Council. Their headquarters is situated at the Post 3 () location at the outskirts of Epukiro, east of its centre (). The royal homestead is located at Ezorongondo. After the death of Mbanderu paramount chief Munjuku Nguvauva II in 2008 the rift in the Ovambanderu community deepened. One faction calling themselves the \\"Concerned Group\\" supported Keharanjo Nguvauva as successor to the throne. They crowned him in 2008 because he was born in wedlock of Munjuku and his wife Aletta. The other faction of the Ovambanderu Traditional Authority favoured his older half- brother, Deputy Minister of Fisheries Kilus Nguvauva. A government enquiry commission confirmed Keharanjo as chief in 2009. After the death of Keharanjo, Aletta was elected as the paramount chief to succeed her son Keharanjo. ==Economy and Infrastructure== The village is underdeveloped with regards to access to safe water and sanitation, and medical care. There is a government clinic at Epukiro but no ambulance and no mortuary. The main economic activity is farming with cattle and goats. While the Mbanderu are reasonably well-off, the San live in abject poverty. Epukiro is situated on the national road C22 halfway between Okakarara and Gobabis. It is further connected by road to Gam, Okatumba and Eiseb, and to Otjombinde. These roads are not tarred and in generally bad shape. ==Education== There are four schools in the Epukiro area, among them: * Epukiro Post 3 Junior Secondary School * Epukiro Roman Catholic Primary School for 300 children ==References== Category:Populated places in the Omaheke Region Category:1902 establishments in German South West Africa Category:Populated places established in 1902 ","title":"Epukiro"},{"id":"35848425","text":"regulator in the collection of the Teylers Museum, 1865 Andreas Hohwü (July 18, 1803 in Gråsten – October 28, 1885) was a Danish clockmaker active in Amsterdam.

In 1953, the unit consisted of: * a headquarters with companies at: ** 1 SAI itself in Oudsthoorn as A Company, ** 1 SSB in Bloemfontein as B Company; ** 4 Field Regiment in Potchefstroom as C Company; and **a supply & transport company, an attempt at all arms training. UDF era 1 SAI companies circa 1950s The unit was reconstituted as 1 SA Infantry Battalion in November 1967 and moved to its current base at Tempe near Bloemfontein, in November 1973. ===1 SAI in the development of modern mechanised infantry=== By 1976 infantry operations transformed drastically when the Ratel Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) was introduced for the first time and in November the first Ratel course was presented at 1 SAI by then Major Roland de Vries. In 1977, 1 SAI received its first consignment of 42 Ratel IFVs. The shoulder flash of 1 SAI was redesigned depicting a rampant honey badger, while the first mechanised infantry junior leadership training courses started. From 1977 to 1981, mechanised infantry leadership students shared the same lines as 1 SAIs conventional companies, but were required to wear a nutria brassard on the right arm with a green and yellow embroidered honey badger insignia in order to stand out and ensure Espirit de Corps. The training wing became identified as the T&D; Wing and all students attended the same course until the Section Leaders Phase had been completed. Section Leaders were then awarded their Lance Corporal stripes and then placed with regular rifle companies. The rest of the future NCOs also received their stripes and future Officers received their white Candidate Officer's tabs. These students were then evaluated and split into the Mechanised Platoon Commanders Course and Specialist Instructors Course. These platoon commanders were destined to either become future leaders of 1 SAIs rifle companies or instructors at the Training Wing, while the Specialist Instructors would become Officers and NCO's responsible for training of Ratel gunners and drivers. *All students qualifying as Section Leaders were authorised to wear one parallel green bar above their two Corporal stripes. *Students that qualified as Platoon NCOs were authorised to wear two parallel green bars. The Platoon NCOs were responsible for the support of the vehicles, platoon weapons and signal equipment of a specific platoon. *Students that completed either the Platoon Commanders or Specialist Instructors Course were permitted to wear three parallel green bars above their stripes, signifying their platoon sergeant status. Platoon sergeants were responsible for the training and discipline of an allocated platoon. SADF era 1 SAI Mechanised Leader Brassards 1980s By January 1981, the training wing was renamed the Mechanised Leadership Wing and moved to the Akkedisdorp premises outside the lines of 1 SAI and next to 1 SSB. The wearing of the distinctive honey badger student brassard was discontinued during this period. The mechanised techniques developed at 1 SAI was transferred to two additional mechanised infantry battalions under development at that time, namely 4 SAI and 8 SAI. ===Battalion Pioneer Platoon=== 1 SAI also had an assault pioneer capability in the 1980s, usually designated Oscar Company. Assault pioneers were the integral combat engineering component of the battalion. Assault pioneers were trained in tasks such as: *Field defences and obstacles *Mine detection and removal * Primary demolitions *Non standard bridging * Anchorages and suspension traverses The Pioneer Platoon provided small tasks and close support capabilities to the battalion ensuring immediacy of response and decreasing the workload of the engineer squadrons. By the 1990s this function was retired to the Engineering Corps however. ===Bushwar=== Operations By 1978, 1 SAI took part in Operation Reindeer. 1 SAI was also later involved in: *Sceptic, *Protea, *Daisy, *Askari *Moduler and *Operation Hooper. =Honouris Crux recipients= The following 1 SAI members were awarded the Honoris Crux decoration Operation Sceptic; * Lt. J.J. du Toit * LCpl A.T. Rutherford Operation Protea; * Cpl A.D.

It was written by Tricky Stewart, Penelope Magnet and Terius Nash, while Dallas Austin produced the song. There are two versions of the song, one with vocals by founding member Mutya Buena, and another featuring Amelle Berrabah's vocals, Buena's replacement. \\"Gotta Be You\\" is a crunk&B; song that lyrically discuss reacting to judgements created by the media. Several music critics noted similarities between the song and \\"Try Again\\" by Aaliyah. Upon the release of the album, \\"Gotta Be You\\" garnered mixed reviews from critics. ==Writing and recording== \\"Gotta Be You\\" was written by Tricky Stewart, Penelope Magnet and Terius Nash, and produced by American singer and producer Dallas Austin, who produced four other tracks from Taller in More Ways (2005), including its singles \\"Push the Button\\" and \\"Ugly\\". The song's engineering process was completed by Rick Shepphard, while the recording engineers were Graham Marsh (producer), Ian Rossiter and Owen Clark. The track was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at TwentyOne Studios in London; this was assisted by Richard Edgeler. Austin provided the song's drums and keys, while the guitar and bass guitar were provided by Tony Reyes. On 21 December 2005, it was announced that group member Mutya Buena had left the Sugababes. Amelle Berrabah was soon announced as her replacement. As a result of the group line-up change, \\"Gotta Be You\\", along with two other tracks, \\"Red Dress\\" and \\"Follow Me Home\\", was re-recorded to feature vocals by Berrabah and the removal of vocals by Buena. All three tracks were featured in a re-issued version of Taller in More Ways that was released in March 2006. ==Composition and lyrics== \\"Gotta Be You\\" is a crunk&B; song that lasts for three minutes and 40 seconds. Ben Hogwood of musicOMH described it as an \\"electric piece of club R&B;\\". According to group member Keisha Buchanan, the Sugababes are the first British band to incorporate the American sound in their music. Kitty Empire of The Observer called it \\"brooding R&B;\\" and noted its reminiscence of \\"Try Again\\" by American R&B; singer, Aaliyah. Similarly, K. Ross Hoffman of Allmusic wrote that \\"Gotta Be You\\" \\"treads melodically close to the song\\", in which he described the latter as \\"majestic\\". Another critic, Nick Southall from Stylus Magazine, wrote that it is \\"disarmingly close\\" to \\"Try Again\\". Buchanan explained the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track analysis of the album on the group's official website, saying: \\"This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you. When we heard the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us a while to get that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's hard to look at that in a positive way. We could really relate to the song.\\" ==Critical reception== \\"Gotta Be You\\" was re-recorded to feature the vocals by Amelle Berrabah (pictured). Upon the release of Taller in More Ways, \\"Gotta Be You\\" garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics. According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, Austin \\"adds a light, but none the less thrilling dusting of monotonal crunk- influenced synthesised honking\\" to the song. Petridis elaborated that this is \\"about as far as the album ventures into the realms of hos and playas, fuckin' the atmosphere or otherwise.\\" Ben Hogwood of musicOMH gave a favorable review; he described it as a \\"dancefloor anthem in the making and surely a future single\\". Talia Kraines of the BBC was critical of \\"Gotta Be You\\", calling it an \\"annoying\\" and \\"dull r'n'b-lite\\" track. Hoffman of Allmusic was also unfavorable of the song, writing that it \\"pillages less successfully\\" compared to other tracks from the album. He elaborated that despite a \\"passable foundation of synth-fuzz R&B; with trendy tabla-esque skittering\\", the song \\"can't help but pale by comparison\\" to \\"Try Again\\". Alex Roginski of The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the songwriting as \\"flat\\". According to Joe Muggs of The Daily Telegraph, \\"Gotta Be You\\" \\"feels like a deliberate attempt to woo the US market\\". ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording *Recorded at D.A.R.P.

His parents were from Ruthin, Wales. Synchronome clock in US National Institute of Standards and Technology museum, Gaithersburg, Maryland. Frank became interested in electrical apparatus when his elder brother Robert worked for a telephone company and assisted him when he began designing and building electric organs. Frank himself moved into the field of electric clocks and together with George Bennett Bowell founded the Synchronome business in 1895, the same year that the pair secured an important patent, embodying the 'Synchronome switch'.British patent no. 1587 (1895) They formed the Synchronome Syndicate Company of London in 1897 with the assistance of company promoters.Robert Miles, Synchronome - Masters of Electrical Timekeeping (AHS: Ticehurst, 2011), pp. 6-9 Following an aborted plan to float the firm on the London Stock Exchange in 1899, Bowell left to pursue his own interests. Hope- Jones continued the business, trading as the Synchronome Company, which was only finally incorporated in 1912. The Synchronome company manufactured electrically operated master clocks, all utilizing the Synchronome switch patented in 1895, with later improvements. These were pendulum clocks which were automatically impulsed every half minute by mechanical means, the mechanism then being reset electrically. William Hamilton Shortt, a gifted railway engineer, joined the Synchronome Company in 1912 as a director, contributing towards efforts to create precision pendulum clocks. First attempts met with little success, and efforts were interrupted by the Great War, but Shortt persisted, and in 1921 was vindicated with the remarkable success of the Shortt-Synchronome clock. Such clocks were the most accurate available prior to the development of the quartz crystal and atomic clocks. Miles, Synchronome, pp. 16-17; 27-30; chapters 8 and 9 passim. He was also interested in timekeeping via radio signals and in 1913 Synchronome started to manufacture the Horophone, a device for capturing radio time signals. He was highly influential in the promulgation of wireless technology, and was elected the first chairman of the Wireless Society of London in 1913, a post he occupied for ten years.Miles, Synchronome, p. 198. In 1921, Hope-Jones orchestrated a petition from the Wireless Society of London to the Postmaster General, urging the authorities to permit renewed wireless transmissions, following a wartime ban, and this document was pivotal in securing government agreed to permit public transmissions by Marconi and later by the BBC from its 2LO radio station. In 1924, legislation made Daylight Saving Time permanent, as opposed to a temporary measure, first introduced in the war. Hope-Jones personally announced the arrival of Summer Time in a broadcast on 12 April 1924, from a new BBC studio. He also suggested to the BBC that they should transmit a time signal and in 1925 the Greenwich pips were first broadcast.Horological Journal, vol lxvii, no 805 (September 1925), p. 2. In 1931, he published Electric Clocks (NAG Press), which offered a comprehensive survey of the field of electrical horology, with some emphasis on the Synchronome system for which Hope-Jones remained a tireless canvasser. He reworked and updated the material significantly to produce Electrical Timekeeping (NAG Press) in 1940, which was again revised for a new edition in 1949. This remained the key English language publication on electrical horology, until R.H. Miles published Synchronome – Masters of Electrical Timekeeping (AHS) in 2011. In 1946 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the British Horological Institute. He died in April 1950 at his home in Richmond, Surrey, at the age of 83. He had married Florence M.

The legend has inspired works of poetry, literature and art. ==Synopsis== Long ago, a beautiful and richly dressed woman occasionally attended services at St. Senara's Church in Zennor, and sometimes at Morvah. The parishioners were enchanted by her beauty and her voice, for her singing was sweeter than all the rest. She appeared infrequently for scores of years, but never seemed to age, and nobody knew whence she came, although they watched her from the summit of Tregarthen Hill. After many years, the mysterious woman became interested in a young man named Mathey Trewella, \\"the best singer in the parish.\\" One day he followed her home, and disappeared; neither was ever seen again in Zennor Church. The villagers wondered what had become of the two, until one Sunday a ship cast anchor about a mile from Pendour Cove. Soon after, a mermaid appeared, and asked that the anchor be raised, as one of its flukes was resting on her door, and she was unable to reach her children. The sailors obliged, and quickly set sail, believing the mermaid to be an ill omen. But when the villagers heard of this, they concluded that the mermaid was the same lady who had long visited their church, and that she had enticed Mathey Trewella to come and live with her.William Bottrell, Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West Cornwall, Second Series (Beare and Son, Penzance, 1873). The parishioners at St. Senara's commemorated the story by having one end of a bench carved in the shape of a mermaid. A shorter account of the legend was related to Bottrell on a subsequent visit to Cornwall. The mermaid had come to church every Sunday to hear the choir sing, and her own voice was so sweet that she enticed Mathey Trewella, son of the churchwarden, to come away with her; neither was seen again on dry land. The famed \\"mermaid chair\\" was the same bench on which the mermaid had sat and sung, opposite Trewella in the singing loft.William Bottrell, Stories and Folk-Lore of West Cornwall, Third Series (F. Rodda, Penzance, 1880). ==Today== The Zennor Mermaid Chair The \\"mermaid chair\\" at St. Senara's Church can be seen to this day, and together with the accompanying legend, is one of the popular attractions mentioned in tourist guides to Cornwall.Rita Tregellas Pope, Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly (Landmark Visitors Guide, Hunter Publishing, 2006), p. 127. The story of the mermaid is retold in later collections of Cornish folklore, generally following the original accounts collected by Bottrell.Frederick Ignatius Cowles, The Magic of Cornwall (Heath Cranton, 1934). In The Fabled Coast, the \\"mermaid chair\\" is described as a fifteenth-century carving. Kingshill and Westwood suppose that the bench itself inspired the legend, rather than the other way around, as the villagers related.Sophia Kingshill, Jennifer Westwood, The Fabled Coast: Legends & traditions from around the shores of Britain & Ireland (Random House, 2012) ==Adaptations== \\"The Ballad of the Mermaid of Zennor\\", is a poem by Vernon Watkins. \\"The Mermaid of Zennor\\", 1922. \\"The Mermaid of Zennor\\", is a poem by John Heath-Stubbs, who lived in Zennor for a while in the 1950s.

Cornishman, (1980), Burlington Records, BURL 005, sleeve notes Craig Weatherhill wrote the Mermaid of Zennor into his novel Seat of Storms (Tabb House, 1997), giving her the name Azenor, as the previous tellings never name her. The Mermaid of Zennor is a poem by Charles Causley, published (with further content about the legend) in a book of the same or a similar title -- some early editions are called 'The Merrymaid of Zennor'. It is illustrated by Michael Foreman; Eileen Moloney published a book of the same title, illustrated by Maise Meiklejohn in 1946. The legend is linked to St. Senara in Sue Monk Kidd's, The Mermaid Chair, which was adapted into a movie in 2006. British writer Helen Dunmore was inspired in part by the Mermaid of Zennor when writing her Ingo Chronicles. The first book of the series, Ingo, published in 2005, begins with the story of the mermaid and the main story line is loosely based around the legend. British Folk singer Seth Lakeman wrote a song called \\"Closing Hymn\\" about the Mermaid of Zennor. 2011 saw the premiere of composer Leo Geyer and poet Martin Kratz's modern retelling of the legend in a chamber opera, which was described by The Times as \\"imaginative and beautifully shaped\\" in its second production by Constella OperaBallet at the Tête à Tête Opera Festival 2012. In 2012 the legend was adapted by Paul Drayton for an opera commissioned by the Cornish company Duchy Opera. In 2014 indie band The Hit Parade released their album Cornish Pop Songs featuring the song \\"Zennor Mermaid.\\" In a curious twist, the local arts writer who interviewed Hit Parade founder Julian Henry for The Cornishman was named \\"Lee Trewhela.\\" In 2014 singer/songwriter Martha Tilston released her album The Sea featuring the song \\"Mermaid of Zennor\\". 2015 saw the premier of \\"The Mermaid of Zennor\\" by Philip Harper, a work for brass band. Commissioned for the Cornwall Youth Brass Band, it was chosen for the National Brass Band Championship regionals in the same year (second section). 2020 - Cornish Folk singer Hazel Simmons releases song \\"The Mermaid of Zennor\\" based on the legend. ==NotesReferences== Category:Cornish culture Category:Cornish folklore Category:Mermaids ","title":"Mermaid of Zennor"},{"id":"35848568","text":"Railmagra is a town in Railmagra Tehsil in Rajsamand District in Rajasthan state in India.

Photograph includes Kath Walker and several other unidentified men and women. Crawford was involved in the radical art and literary movements of Brisbane's 1940s. She was a member of the Barjai group which published the radical youth art magazine Barjai. This magazine was edited by Barrett Reid and Laurence Collinson and published between 1943 and 1947.Watson, Joanne. 'Brisbane's Little Chelsea': the cultural legacy of the Barjai and Miya groups. Overland, no.174, Autumn 2004: 58–62. Barjai magazine described itself as 'a meeting place for youth'. Crawford was also involved in the establishment of the Miya Studio.The University of Queensland. The Miya Studio Archive. UQ Art Museum at University of Queensland, n.d. Web, 2011. 29 April 2012 http://www.artmuseum.uq.edu.au/miya-studio-archive In 1988, she donated a large collection of artworks from the Miya Studio to the University of Queensland. ==Early life== Pamela Seeman was born in Brisbane in 1921. In 1942, Crawford entered the Central Technical College in George Street, Brisbane, as a full-time student. She had been unable to do so earlier due to a family illness. Once she completed the introductory course, she began studying fashion as theatrical design was not offered. Crawford later transferred into Industrial Drawing under John Appleyard. Crawford was still attending some classes in 1945; however, she left college before she was awarded her diploma.Anderson, Michele Elizabeth. Barjai, Miya Studio and Young Brisbane Artists of the 1940s: Towards a Radical Practice. St Lucia: University of Queensland. 1987. Print., p. 4 ==Career== The Barjai magazine was created at Brisbane State High School by Barrett Reid, Laurence Collinson and Cecil Knopke in 1943. Barjai was the Aboriginal word for 'meeting place'. The aim of the Barjai was to allow adolescents to express themselves about experimental art and literature. However, Headmaster Waddle prohibited the newspaper from the school; Reid sold the Barjai on the path outside. The magazine continued outside of school and by 1944, the Barjai group held fortnightly meetings in the Australasian Catholic Assurance building at Queen Street, Brisbane. By this stage the Barjai group had grown considerably. Writers included people like Thea Astley, Laurence Collinson, Barret Reid, Barbara Patterson (known as Blackman), Pat O'Rourke and Vida Smith (known as Horn). Artists, such as, Pamela Seeman, Joy Roggenkamp and Laurence Hope also joined the magazine. This group was further joined by associate writers, Judith Wright, James Devaney, Jack McKinney and Val Vallis. The Barjai had an audience of around three hundred people and more than fifty people contributed poetry, stories, essays and artworks. The Miya Studio was formed in 1945 as a break-away from the more conservative Royal Queensland Art Society when the parent body disapproved of the direction of the Younger Artist's Group (YAG). Indeed, this group had been established by Crawford (then Seeman), Laurence Collinson, Joy Roggenkamp, Laurence Hope and Cecil Knopke. There was no government funding at that time for independent art schools and budding artists needed a studio to express their passion. The Miya studio was different from other artist groups as the artists painted with radical intent, rather than for a record of achievement. Crawford became the secretary- treasurer for the Miya Studio in March, 1946. The Miya Studio operated between 1945 and 1949 and had grown out of the Barjai group. Studio members organised art exhibitions and other events, such as, public lectures held by emerging intellectuals and writers of the day. The first major exhibition was in 1946, held at the Banquet Hall of Hotel Canberra. The artworks from the exhibition included Crawford's paintings Ivory Tower and Shadow Partners. The Miya artists' style was loosely based on Expressionism. This style was highly advanced in the Brisbane art scene during this period.Hatherell William. Collinson, Laurence Henry (Laurie) (1925–1986). National Centre of Biography at Australian National University, n.d. Web, 2012. 29 April 2012 http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/collinson-laurence-henry-laurie-12337, p. 6 An art critic who had visited the exhibition stated that Crawford was one of the most promising artists in the show. Most critics, however, were dismissive of the modernist work of the group. Joanne Watson's brief history of the Barjai group, published in Overland (2004) records Crawford as saying: '\\"Most Modern art was regarded by the art establishment as an unlovely aberration that would go away if ignored.\\" Her nude study, alongside Laurence Collinson's antiwar painting drew police attention at Finney's Gallery in 1948.' In September 1949, Pamela Crawford spoke at the Youth Charter Conference held in Trades Hall, Brisbane. This conference was held to expose the enemies of the Youth in order to allow Youths to have a better life. One hundred and fifteen delegates from 47 organisations participated in the conference.Queensland Youth Voice,'47 Organisations Support Youth Charter Conference', Jim Crawford Collection, UQFL301, Box 3, Folder 6, Fryer Library, University of Queensland Library. Crawford attended art classes of Caroline Barker and Miss Birkbeck whose studios were in Brisbane. However, these teachers were not progressive artists of the 1950s. Like many young Brisbane artists of the period, Crawford attended lectures held by Dr. Gertrude Langer. Langer, a Viennese art historian who had fled the rise of Nazism in Germany, had become influential in the development of the Arts in Queensland and was a central figure for Miya Studio artists. Langer also offered her support to the Barjai group. Crawford stated that she was educated on many topics during these lectures, such as, the Impressionists and the Fauves. Crawford's photographs appeared in edition twenty of the Barjai. Barjai magazine and Miya studio members frequented the Pink Elephant Cafe which gained the reputation in Brisbane as a meeting place for the unruly. It was not uncommon for police raids to occur on the suspicion that alcohol trading was apparent. In the late '40s, Crawford began spending a lot of time with a radical society called the New Theatre Club. Consequently, the Miya Studio began to merge with this radical club. The New Theatre Club stood for \\"Peace, Freedom and Cultural progress\\". This amalgamation was named the Artists group of the New Theatre, which formally constituted in June, 1949. The Miya Studio group officially ended in 1950. Crawford was elected the first chairman of the new art society. Through this association, Crawford began stage designing and in 1952, she illustrated costume sketches for Jim Crawford's play the Bushland Picnic. View across Youth Charter Conference.

Crawford was influenced by Jim's political philosophy and may also have become a member of the Communist Party. The marriage inspired her to unite her artistic and theatrical passions.Anderson, Michele Elizabeth. Barjai, Miya Studio and Young Brisbane Artists of the 1940s: Towards a Radical Practice. St Lucia: University of Queensland. 1987.

The association was founded in 1950 with the mission to preserve historical sites around Queensland, Northern New South Wales, France and Great Britain. One of the historical sites that the association worked towards saving was Meigunyah house, Brisbane, built in 1886. In 1988, Crawford donated a series of artworks (including around fifty of her own works) from the Miya Studio to the University of Queensland. This series of artworks allowed the University of Queensland to hold an exhibition dedicated to the young Brisbane artists who lived during the 1940s. This exhibition, titled \\"Young Turks and Battle Lines\\", was the first exhibition to explore this aspect of the city's cultural history. Crawford died in 1997. ==References * PDF link to list of what is included in Jim Crawford Collection in Fryer Library, UQ St Lucia. * The Australia Dictionary of Biography – James Crawford. * University of Queensland.

A distant view of the mausoleum The Diri Baba Mausoleum () – is a mausoleum of Sheikh Diri Baba, located in Qobustan (town) of Gobustan Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==Architecture== The mausoleum was described in diaries of K. de Bryuin and A.Oleariy, and also in a work of B.Dorn. The mausoleum stands in a square located on a glyptic cliff. The building is two-storeyed. The first store has a hall covered with an ogive, which has a passageway to an octahedral cupola from a small vestibule. Stairs leading to the hall of the second store have been carved on the cliff. A spherical cupola with a pointed top has squinches decorated with plant ornaments. There is a fragment of a ligature, indicating a date – the year 1402, and also a part of the architect’s name – “…the son of ustad Haji” – in one of the squinches. Many legends and myths are connected to this place. Diri Baba mausoleum was decorated with a mosaic and effective ligature by a calligraphist called “Dervish”. There is a unique monument – a two-storeyed mausoleum-mosque of the 15th century called “Diri-Baba”, located opposite an ancient cemetery – on the way from Baku to Shamakhi. For a long time, local residents believed in a legend that a sacred person called Diri Baba was buried here and remained imperishable. However, many legends and mystic events are related to this monument. That is why the mausoleum attracts many pilgrims and curious people since the 17th century. Peculiarity of the construction is that it was embed in the cliff by the architect. Allegedly it is “hanging” alienated from the ground. The mausoleum delights with austerity of its architecture, purity of lines, bright and smooth surface of its walls against the background of the rough and dark cliff, and it is also distinguished by its grandeur. It is notable that, not the first, but the second store is considered the main part of the building. A small corridor covered with an octagonal cupola, where guests take their shoes off, is followed by the hall. There is an entrance to half-dark stairs carved on thickness of the cliff and these stairs lead to the second store of a burial vault. A hall – with an area of 15 quadratic meters – is covered with a spherical cupola. A funeral text which indicates the name of a ruler of the Shirvanshahs – Ibrahim I of Shirvan, is carved in the wall. A decorative tier, with a ligature as if surrounding the building, detaches the floors. The mausoleum is closely adjoined the cliff, on a massif of which is carved a grotto. This place is where the Saint was buried. A narrow entry in the northern wall leads to this place. Architecture of Diri Baba mausoleum harmonically fits into picturesque surroundings of the building – view against the background of rocks and greenery of trees. The building of the mausoleum is a masterpiece of the architectural school of Shirvan and a beautiful creation of arts of ancient masters. The monument is protected by the government. ==References== Category:Islamic architecture Category:Mausoleums in Azerbaijan Category:Tourist attractions in Azerbaijan Category:Gobustan District ","title":"Diri Baba Mausoleum"},{"id":"35848616","text":"Władysław Pachulski (c. 18551919) was a Polish violinist, pianist and amateur composer who was the secretary to and later son-in-law of Nadezhda von Meck, the patroness for 13 years of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Pachulski was often the intermediary between composer and patroness, who had agreed never to meet face to face but to conduct an epistolary relationship. He played a significant role in the events surrounding the sudden break between them in 1890, and probably even instigated it. He lived in Russia most of his adult life, where his name was rendered as Владислав Альбертович Пахульский (Vladislav Al'bertovich Pakhul'sky). He was the elder brother of the composer Henryk Pachulski. ==Biography== Władysław Pachulski was born in Łazy, Lublin Voivodeship, eastern Poland in 1855 or 1857, to a poor family.Poznansky, p. 288 He studied at the Moscow Conservatory and one of his teachers there for some time was Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. In 1877 Tchaikovsky left the Conservatory to become a full-time composer, with the ongoing financial support of a wealthy widow, Nadezhda von Meck. A very unusual feature of their arrangement was that they agreed never to meet, but would communicate only by letter or messenger. Another of Tchaikovsky's students, and later possibly his lover, was Iosif Kotek. On Tchaikovsky's recommendation, von Meck had engaged Kotek as her house musician. She had a succession of musicians in her coterie, none of whom lasted long, and before long Kotek too was dismissed. Pachulski succeeded Kotek, and he proved to be the only musician who ever gained a permanent place in her affections. The difference was that he was not recommended by Tchaikovsky, whose opinion of his musical talents was always very low. Pachulski in fact made his own introductions to von Meck. On 4 January 1878, she wrote to Tchaikovsky saying that one of his former pupils (unnamed) was writing to her constantly, saying that life at the Conservatory was not the same since Tchaikovsky had left. Just why she regarded Pachulski so favourably in the first place is not clear. His father Albert Pachulski managed one of von Meck's estates, although it is not known whether he was already there at that time or came later. Maybe it was because Władysław showed the same love of Tchaikovsky's music as she herself felt. Whatever her reasons, she offered him employment, and immediately began asking Tchaikovsky to provide him with lessons and advice. This he agreed to, because he felt an obligation to show his gratitude for her generosity towards him; he also felt it appropriate to make his assessments of Pachulski's skills as favourable as he could, without sacrificing his artistic integrity. However, he soon found it burdensome and tiresome.Poznansky, p. 289 Pachulski considered himself extremely gifted, and von Meck also had an exaggerated opinion of his musical talents, due no doubt to her personal regard for him;Poznansky, p.291 he was a constant topic of her correspondence with Tchaikovsky through 1878.Poznansky, p. 317 Thanks to this over-elevated self-regard, even the most tactful of Tchaikovsky's negative criticisms of his compositional abilities caused him great pain. The constant theme of Tchaikovsky's remarks was that Pachulski had musical ability, desire, zeal, intelligence and warm feeling, but not the proper balance between these qualities, owing to \\"an organic, and … enigmatic, defect of his musical nature\\" (as he wrote in a letter to von Meck in August 1883).Poznansky, pp. 442-443 He wrote to his brother Anatoly in August 1879 that Pachulski \\"has certain features of a Turgenevan hero, who has genuine and ardent desires to fulfill grandiose plans but ...\\" (leaving unsaid the inference that he does not possess the artistic capacity to do so).Poznansky, p. 344 Pachulski made himself invaluable to von Meck, and she described him as an exemplary secretary; she later said she would never find another like him; she taught him everything he knew about travel, foreign languages and financial affairs. She described his heart as “rare and unparalleled”, which earned him her respect despite his youth (he was aged between 20 and 23 at this time; she was aged 46).Poznansky, p. 290 After the first performance of Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony on 10 February 1878, which was dedicated to Nadezhda von Meck, Władysław Pachulski spoke about nothing else for days and constantly played excerpts on the piano, which helped her understand the work more deeply. Later that year Tchaikovsky agreed to von Meck's idea of empowering Pachulski to negotiate directly with Édouard Colonne regarding the French premiere of the 4th Symphony, although he doubted Colonne would agree to perform the work.Poznansky, p. 350 Claude Debussy, then a struggling composition student from the Paris Conservatoire, was employed in the von Meck household on three occasions between 1880 and 1882, as house pianist and music master to her children. He also accompanied the family on their visits to Europe. During their stay in Florence in 1880, he wrote his Premier Trio en Sol (First Trio in G) for a piano trio comprising himself on piano, Pachulski on violin, and the cellist Pyotr Danilchenko.Henle Debussy proposed marriage to Nadezhda von Meck's daughter Sophie, and shortly afterwards found himself on his way back to Paris.NaxosClassics Online In June 1883, Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Modest, describing Pachulski's latest symphony as \\"frightful rubbish\\" and \\"abominable scribblings\\", and expressed what a pity it was that, for fear of upsetting his patroness, he could not tell Pachulski frankly of the utter futility of his mania to compose. Tchaikovsky had previously written to Anatoly complaining of how often he had to work with Pachulski, and also how personally unappealing he was.Poznansky, p. 352 Pachulski would have by now sensed the ill will that Tchaikovsky felt towards him personally, not just the low opinion he had for his compositions.Poznansky, p. 427 Pachulski's role in the von Meck household began to increase throughout 1884, and he made renewed efforts in his composing. In February he had some works performed by a small orchestra at Cannes, and was given to understand that Colonne would be interested enough to program them.Poznansky, p. 442-443 This never happened. In September 1884, Pachulski's father Albert, who was the manager of the Pleshcheyevo estate, intervened in the sleeping arrangements for Tchaikovsky's servant Alyosha Sofronov, which put Tchaikovsky's nose markedly out of joint, and there was an unpleasant altercation. Tchaikovsky wrote to Pachulski about this, and the next day Albert asked to see him to explain things, but was turned away. Pachulski wrote to the composer to apologise for the misunderstanding and asked him to forgive his father. This was a relatively trivial incident in itself, but it enabled Tchaikovsky to release some of the built up irritation he had long felt towards Pachulski junior, even if it was now visited upon his relatively innocent father.Poznansky, pp. 443-444 In March 1885, Nadezhda von Meck asked Tchaikovsky to use his good offices to find Pachulski's younger brother Henryk a teaching position at the Moscow Conservatory.Poznansky, p. 452 Henryk had been studying there since 1880 under Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton Arensky and others. Tchaikovsky's efforts came to nothing but Henryk did succeed in gaining a position there the following year. Władysław Pachulski's nervous condition was a frequent topic of Nadezhda von Meck's letters to Tchaikovsky in 1886 and 1887. His musical studies with Tchaikovsky had ceased for now. In July 1887 she wrote that he was constantly fearful, expecting to be arrested at every moment, and believing others were conspiring against him.Poznansky, pp. 479-80 But things improved for Pachulski. On 22 September 1888, von Meck announced that he was engaged to her favourite daughter Yuliya, and that they had been conducting an affair for the past 7 years. Von Meck regarded this as \\"a great grief\\", not because of any negative feelings about Pachulski, but because she would be losing a daughter \\"who is essential to me, without whom my existence is impossible\\". Pachulski and Yuliya Karlovna von Meck married in Paris on 16 April 1889.Poznansky, p. 499 Pachulski was now in an excellent position, were he so minded, to exact some revenge for what he perceived as slights towards him from his musical idol Tchaikovsky.Poznansky, p. 493 During 1889 the von Meck estates experienced severe financial difficulties, leading to Nadezhda becoming ill and unable to write. For many months, Tchaikovsky's only contact with her was through Władysław Pachulski.Poznansky, p. 503 Pachulski had resumed composing and Tchaikovsky was now even more resigned to keeping on giving polite critiques of work he despised.Poznansky, p. 494 On 1 July 1890, without any explanation, Nadezhda von Meck sent Tchaikovsky his entire annual allowance of 6,000 rubles in advance; she had always previously paid it in smaller instalments.Poznansky, p. 511 On 13 September she wrote to him in Tiflis, expressing dismay at her children's financial affairs, but giving no hint of any change to her arrangement with the composer.Poznansky, pp. 512-513 On 22 September, Tchaikovsky received another letter from her, informing him she was bankrupt and she could no longer subsidise him. This letter is no longer extant, but to judge from the reply he drafted the same day, she apparently accused him of keeping her in his thoughts only while he enjoyed her munificence. He denied this absolutely, told her how much these words pained him, and pledged to always keep her in his affections. He was not to know it at the time, but it was the last letter he ever wrote her. It is also very likely that she never saw this reply. This completely unheralded cessation of an arrangement that had been in existence for 13 years can reasonably be attributed to the influence of others, most likely members of her family. She had known of her financial difficulties for over a year but had never hinted they would affect the arrangement.Poznansky, p. 514 There is no evidence that von Meck intended their correspondence or their friendship to end merely because her financial support of him was no longer possible.Poznansky, p. 521 Some have conjectured the reason for the break was that von Meck had never been aware of Tchaikovsky's homosexuality and had suddenly been informed of it, which offended her puritanical moral code. This is highly unlikely. It is more plausible that someone threatened to ruin Tchaikovsky by publicly exposing his homosexuality, if she did not comply with their wishes to withdraw her support for him; and that her acquiescence in this was purely from a desire to protect his reputation and allow him to continue composing uninterrupted.Poznansky, p. 519 That Władysław Pachulski was the main instigator of this affair was a charge made by Tchaikovsky's devoted servant Alyosha Sofronov in a letter of 13 October 1890; by Yuri Davydov; by Nadezhda von Meck's granddaughter Olga Bennigsen; and by many later commentators. But it remains in the realm of conjecture. Tchaikovsky received no reply to his letter to von Meck of 22 September, so he wrote to Pachulski, who corresponded with him throughout November, keeping him abreast of von Meck's poor state of health, but also conveying her good wishes.Poznansky, p. 522 On 3 January 1891 Pachulski wrote to Tchaikovsky, blaming himself for the situation they were in, and saying that his admiration and respect for the composer, and that of the whole von Meck household for him, was undiminished. In particular, he told Tchaikovsky that he had shown Nadezhda his letter, and he passed on her assurances that her attitude to him was unchanged. But Nadezhda never again wrote to Tchaikovsky personally to convey such expressions of regard, or anything else.Poznansky, p. 523 Anna (Davydova) von Meck, Tchaikovsky's niece, who had married Nadezhda's son Nikolai, later provided evidence that Pachulski was playing one side off against the other through what Poznansky names an \\"outright lie\\". Nadezhda complained bitterly to Anna that her uncle Tchaikovsky had promised to continue writing to her after her subsidy stopped, but he never again did. It is clear that Nadezhda was never shown any of Tchaikovsky's later letters, and the supposed expressions of her regard sent via Pachulski were simply made up by him. So, while it cannot be conclusively proven that Pachulski instigated the stopping of the subsidy, there is no doubt that he made sure the break between patroness and composer became total and bitter and permanent. For his part, Tchaikovsky was deeply offended by von Meck's apparent sudden lack of interest in him. It was not so much that she did not personally write to him anymore, because he knew she was chronically ill, but that the messages he received from Pachulski about her ceased to include any enquiries from her about his welfare, his music or his life, and they were reduced to meaningless politenesses. Tchaikovsky made it very clear to Pachulski that he wanted and needed his relationship with Nadezhda to continue unchanged in the slightest degree, despite the cessation of her financial support. He expressed this in his letter to Pachulski of 6 June 1891, after eight months of waiting fruitlessly for a reply from von Meck.Poznansky, p. 526 Pachulski then advised that even his own relationship with his mother-in-law had changed greatly and he could no longer be an intermediary between her and Tchaikovsky. He returned Tchaikovsky's letter of 6 June, presumably to prevent von Meck or her family ever seeing it and becoming aware of his machinations. This was the last contact Tchaikovsky ever had with Pachulski or with Nadezhda von Meck or her household (other than his niece Anna).Poznansky, p. 528 Tchaikovsky died two years and five months later, bitter and resentful to the end about what he saw as Nadezhda von Meck's betrayal of him. For her part, she sent an expensive wreath but did not attend his funeral (she was very ill and moved with great difficulty).Poznansky, p. 611 She died in Nice, France only three months later. Nothing more is recorded about Władysław Pachulski apart from his death in Moscow in 1919, aged 62 or 64. None of his music was ever published (at least 3 works were published: String Quartet in E minor, Wellegesang for orchestra and Andante for orchestra) or performed by a professional orchestra, and none of it is known to have survived in manuscript. His wife Yuliya died in 1915. None of Pachulski's many letters to Tchaikovsky have survived, but nine of Tchaikovsky's to Pachulski are extant.Tchaikovsky Research ==Sources== * Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, Lime Tree, 1991 ==References== Category:1855 births Category:1919 deaths Category:Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Category:Polish classical violinists Category:Polish classical pianists Category:Russian classical violinists Category:Male classical violinists Category:Russian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:19th-century classical pianists Category:19th- century male musicians ","title":"Władysław Pachulski"},{"id":"35848623","text":"The One Million Pound Note (Hungarian: Az egymillió fontos bankó) is a 1916 Hungarian silent comedy film directed by Alexander Korda and starring Lajos Ujváry, Gyula Nagy and Aladár Ihász.

Panetta Abdulrahman al-Awlaki's father, Anwar al-Awlaki, was alleged to be an operational leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Anwar was killed by a CIA drone strike also ordered by Obama two weeks prior to the killing of his son. ==Death== Human rights groups questioned why al-Awlaki was killed by the U.S. in a country with which the United States was not at war. Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, stated \\"If the government is going to be firing Predator missiles at American citizens, surely the American public has a right to know who's being targeted, and why.\\" Two U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity stated that the target of the October 14, 2011, airstrike was Ibrahim al-Banna, an Egyptian believed to be a senior operative in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Another U.S. administration official speaking on condition of anonymity described Abdulrahman al-Awlaki as a bystander who was \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time,\\" stating that \\"the U.S. government did not know that Mr. Awlaki's son was there\\" before the airstrike was ordered. When pressed by a reporter to defend the targeted killing policy that resulted in Abdulrahman al-Awlaki's death, former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs deflected blame to the victim's father: \\"I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the well-being of their children. I don't think becoming an al-Qaeda jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business.\\" ==Legacy== On January 29, 2017, Anwar al-Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter, Nawar al-Awlaki, the half-sister of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, was killed in the Raid on Yakla, a commando attack ordered by President Donald Trump.Scahill, Jeremy, Pardiss Kebriaei, Baraa Shiban, and Amy Goodman. \\"Yemen: Jeremy Scahill & Advocates Question \\"Success\\" of Trump Raid That Killed 24 Civilians\\", Democracy Now!, 3 February 2017.

He is a columnist for The Daily Star and a blogger. He became fluent in multiple languages and is one of the youngest artists to have a solo exhibition at the National Art Gallery with work in permanent collection at the Liberation War Museum. He finished four years of American high school in eight months with honours and was a college senior by the age of eighteen, teaching university courses in engineering at the age of 21.15 Smartest kids to ever exist Rantlifestyle 29 July 2015 ==Early life and family== As a ten-year-old (seated middle) attending a public event with his father (seated left) His father was a senior member of the Singranatore family and a military commander of the national Army, United Nations forces and the Border Guards, while his mother, Kamrun Nahar of the Munshibari family of Comilla was an artist and scientist, a student of Iajuddin Ahmed, the thirteenth President of Bangladesh. Both parents were born in erstwhile East Pakistan. He grew up in various places around the country. He has an older sister, named Shahzia Sarwar, an architect. The House of Singra and Natore (Singranatore Zamindari) was a formerly ruling family who were hereditary lords (Zamindars) in the northwestern region of Rajshahi in erstwhile East Bengal in the area of present-day Singra, Bangladesh. In 1950, the State Acquisition Act was adopted by the erstwhile democratic Government of East Pakistan, abolishing the rights of the feudal ruling families. The Singranatore family, who served as vassals to the Maharajas of Natore and Dighapatia, also produced many influential members and politicians. ===Background and education=== With family members at a state event in 2000 In 2005, as a youth ambassador to the United States, he was supported by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State. He started high school at Lincoln College Preparatory Academy after completing eighth grade, to study International Baccalaureate and was a senior aged fifteen. His first ever paid job at the age of 16 was to do a MATLAB programming project for Miftahur Rahman at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at North South University. A child prodigy, he could fluently read, write or speak six languages by the age of eight and by 2006 he completed the four-year American high school program in less than nine months, as a member of the Honor Roll, United States National Honor Society and winning awards with the Science Olympiad.THE LINK May 2006, Kansas City Public Schools Then he was offered a Merit Scholarship by the University of Kansas School of Engineering when he was only sixteen years old. He was a final year university student (college senior) studying engineering by the age of eighteen. At Kansas, he was an active brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE) initiated through the Beta Gamma Chapter.20 Real life whiz kids Guff.com He also holds a Master of Public Administration degree (2013) and a PhD in Entrepreneurship and Innovation (2018) from the Henry W. Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He was a graduate researcher under Jered Carr at the L.P. Cookingham Institute of Urban Affairs where Nicholas Peroff was his graduate advisor. He graduated with Pi Alpha Alpha, Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honours. ==Activities== His family was involved in the energy and infrastructure sectors for decades, particularly oil. His paternal uncle M. M. Rahmat Ullah, an East Pakistani bureaucrat from the 1960s and politician who unsuccessfully contested the seat of Natore's third constituency as a member of parliament to the National Assembly in the Eighth National Parliamentary Elections of 2001, was also the Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department and later the chairman of the Capital Development Authority of the Government of Bangladesh under General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the military dictator and later President of Bangladesh. The President and him were however charged in the Janata Tower Case in the early 1990s by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Another paternal uncle, Akther Hussain of Natore, an East Pakistan regional officer of Pakistan State Oil was made one of the six executives of the Jamuna Oil Company, Bangladesh's National oil company under Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation by the Government of Bangladesh. A maternal uncle, Major Raihanul Abedin was the PSC Director of the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation. Working on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh, he oversaw all energy production treaties with various foreign energy companies, including Enron Corporation, Niko Resources, and Tullow Oil. Later, during the military-supported government of Bangladesh in 2007 he was appointed the managing director of Water Supply and Sewerage System. He was forced to resign on charges of nepotism once the ruling party took power in the 2009 national elections when the newly formed government sued top officials of the old regime. The Major was credited with being the first to introduce cooking gas instead of harmful fuels for automotive fuel, to decrease carbon emission in early 2001 under Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. === Clean transportation === In 2008, he cofounded the KU Ecohawks during the Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010 in the United States. The group recycles old vehicles to run on community wastes and renewables, especially on the University of Kansas campus (and adjoining localities) and not rely on conventional fossil fuel sources that pollute the local and global environment. The Ecohawks was one of the largest and most promising initiatives of the University of Kansas and was funded and sponsored by Aptera Motors, The Coca-Cola Company, Daimler Trucks North America, Grundfos, Yokohama Rubber Company and Black & Veatch among others, at various stages. A college senior at age eighteen, he also worked to computationally quantify and minimise vehicle rolling friction and aerodynamic drag. They built a solar energy filling station on campus consisting of six 180W panels that allowed recharging the car batteries in half a day while it is parked. Cars typically reached 40 mph around campus while the fuel economy was increased to 80 mpge due to solar refilling. Although the recycled car ran, initially media reports called the car to get 500 mpg, which it did not. The ecohawks also proposed a plan to take the vehicles completely off grid. They installed six monocrystalline solar cells on their workspace and charged the cars from it, with no energy taken from the grid. Their efficiency over performance initiatives, coincided with the Automotive crisis where in 2009, in an exhibition opening, he told the University Daily Kansan that the point of the initiative is trying to get people to think about how 'inefficient' the auto industry is. Later, Ford Motor Company President and CEO Alan Mulally visited the School of Engineering and talked with the students regarding the auto industry and answered questions about the technological, financial, cultural and political realities facing Ford after being bailed out by the US Congress alongside others of the \\"Big Three\\". The Ecohawks planned to recycle older cars to run on greener technologies thereby eliminating the energy needed for production; the recycle of the vehicle itself prevented the release of a few tons of carbon to the atmosphere. The team researched advanced technologies in the small scale including NiMH, LiCoO2, LiFePO4 batteries. The group used scaled down RC Cars for testing and validation. Research also conceptualised a parallel hybrid design that used a small internal combustion engine running on the a planned biodiesel blend and a brushless electric motor allowing for the doubling of torque. Research with ECM, hydrogen fuel cells and Metal hydride storage tanks, funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) grant that led to the group design an infrastructure with Smart grid technologies to be showcased in Washington, DC and converted more vehicle. The groups designs were adopted by the university when the KU Libraries started using vehicles that were converted by the ecohawks. The KU Libraries mail vehicle travelled about 22 miles on average on a given day. The electric vehicle travels 80 to 90 miles before a recharge. The library car was a Chevrolet K5 Blazer, while the neighbourhood EV was a 1974 Volkswagen Beetle. In February 2011, city officials of Douglas County in Lawrence, KS, declared that the University would be getting an electric car charging station, although the group made the first unofficial charging station in May 2010. In an article by Wired magazine it was estimated that profits, both financial and societal was possible if the ecohawks project was replicated on a larger scale. === Green buildings === Sunny founded the Sustainable Built Environment Initiative – Bangladesh (later Bangladesh Green Building Council) and since 2008 been bringing together national architects, scientists, environmentalists and government officials to transform the building industry in Bangladesh into a more sustainable and efficient system. With growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanisation to major cities, 'Going green' had become a marketing ploy for various organisations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. He offered a centralised board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms and then to propose a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture. About the feasibility of widespread utilisation of LEED certifications, it was further said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. He elaborated:Johanna Poppel Sustainability Corner: A look into LEED – Student Recognizes Global Problem with U.S. Green Building Standards University News, 12 August 2012 In 2015, he opined that the garments industry has been a critical early-adopter of green buildings, with certifications playing a critical role: Educational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in Bangladesh started to promote Green Building principles in their curriculum, such as in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, American International University-Bangladesh, North South University, BRAC University and Asia Pacific University. Due to conserving water and energy,the rating tool would achieve the six-point goals of the National Water Policy of 1999 by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy. National and international energy companies like Energypac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the Seventh Target from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. In another interview with The Independent, it was pointed out that the cost effectiveness of the green buildings are not correctly understood, and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. In the Dhaka Tribune, he reiterated that \\"the problem is that there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction\\" and that the energy savings far outweigh the initial costs when green building projects are correctly done. In an interview with Southeast Asia Building magazine, he said: These activities were also promoted by national and region experts, such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define 'Green' according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organisation to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government's role. BGBC also briefly collabored with Washington D.C. based Development Alternatives Inc to work with World Bank to conduct the first ever national study to identify the scope for developing Green Building Codes and to benchmark the GHG emission standards on Green Buildings and Climate Change in Bangladesh. In 2012, he was a Brower Youth Award semi-finalist.Social media and IT- Writer's Profile – Daily Star In 2013, he won the SBN Youth Award (Australia) by patrons Peter Ellyard and Jane Goodall.2013 SBN Award Winners – Profiles Global Perspectives, 13 July 2015 ===Sustainable infrastructure=== To provide jobs for fresh graduates and help the dwindling power sector of the country reduce systematic power outage, he proposed that Bangladesh integrate RETs into the national electric grid to supplement any generation and to maintain a storage system, so that the country may move towards a more stable supply of electricity to the masses and 'attempt' reach the global Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, specifically on Environmental sustainability as well as Bangladesh's National Renewable Energy Policy's goal of meeting 5% of the national demand with renewable energy sources by 2015 and 10% by 2020. With lack of implementation, he said it would be nearly impossible on the current time frame. Private power could be integrated to the grid and demand response capabilities would mean that Feed-in tariff would be possible for parties who generate power on site and even for energy-efficient home owners. This would expedite investments in sustainable sources of energy. He commented: He urged to lower the system losses and rectify illegal links, and provide more jobs to the large Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering graduate base in Dhaka while transmitters and meters themselves could be made by local populace. During that time, aged only 21, he taught college courses in the fields of electrical engineering and computer science at North South University. Speaking to representatives from Siemens about smart grid and meter utilisations in Bangladesh, he also involved national renewable energy technology providers and private power generation companies in the upgrade and integration plans. Although think tanks such as Bangladesh Solar Energy Society and Renewable Energy Institute (REI), along with the German Federal Government International Development Government Agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) supported his scheme, the Secretary of the Ministry of Power, Government of Bangladesh has said that the government has no plans to upgrade to a smart grid. ==Works== He eventually became one of the youngest artists to have a solo exhibition at the National Art Gallery with work in permanent collection at the Liberation War Museum. ==See also== * List of child prodigies ==References* Sunny Sanwar at Forbes * * Smart City - Case Study, by Sunny, Sanwar A. at Harvard Business Review * Sunny, Sanwar Biography at Amazon ** Sunny, Sanwar (2011) Green Buildings, Clean Transport and the Low Carbon Economy () at Google Books * Sanwar Azam Sunny at Google Scholar * Sanwar Azam Sunny profile at ancestry.com * 15 Smartest kids to ever exist at eBaum's World (July 2015) * Environmental Uncertainty and Climate Change How about the \\"whether\\"? 2013 article with Jimmy Adegoke in Daily Star Category:Living people Category:Bengali male artists Category:Bangladeshi painters Category:Mixed- media artists Category:Pastel artists Category:Bangladeshi people of British descent Category:Bangladeshi people of Turkish descent Category:Bangladeshi people of Indian descent Category:Bangladeshi people of Pakistani descent Category:History painters Category:Bangladeshi scholars Category:People associated with solar power Category:Bangladeshi conservationists Category:Hybrid electric vehicle advocates Category:Green thinkers Category:University of Missouri–Kansas City alumni Category:University of Kansas alumni Category:Bangladeshi mechanical engineers Category:People from Dhaka Category:Bangladeshi columnists Category:Bangladeshi scientists Category:Bengali scientists Category:University of Kansas people Category:People from Jackson County, Missouri Category:Bangladeshi automotive engineers Category:People from Kansas City, Kansas Category:Bangladeshi bloggers Category:Sustainability advocates Category:Bangladeshi engineers Category:Bangladeshi male writers Category:21st-century Bangladeshi people Category:Bangladeshi environmentalists Category:1989 births Category:People from Douglas County, Kansas Category:People from Lawrence, Kansas Category:Artists from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Male bloggers ","title":"Sunny Sanwar"},{"id":"35849184","text":"Girja is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia.

She was a proponent of green building and was a co-founder of the Food Allergy Initiative, the largest fund for food allergy research in the United States. Her 2010 legal separation from her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was highly publicized. Her subsequent suicide in 2012 also received national media attention. == Early life == Mary Kathleen Richardson was born on October 4, 1959 and was raised in Bayonne, New Jersey. Her father, John F. Richardson, was an attorney and a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, who died when she was 12 years old. Kennedy's mother was Nancy Higgins, a public school English teacher. Kennedy had four sisters and two brothers. She attended The Putney School, where she became friends and roommates with Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. She later roomed with Kerry Kennedy in college and served as her maid of honor at her wedding in 1990 to Andrew Cuomo. == Education == Kennedy graduated from Brown University and studied architectural design at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Her close friend Kerry Kennedy stated that Mary spent a semester working for the artist Andy Warhol in 1980. While Edward Kennedy was running for president, Mary Kennedy, then age 20, had raised donations of artwork from Warhol and other prominent artists in his network, including Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein, and Schnabel. == Career == After studying architecture at RISD, Kennedy lived in SoHo, Manhattan, in the 1980s, and was active in the bohemian culture. In 1993, Kennedy worked for the firm Parrish Hadley Design as an architectural designer. She was involved in the renovation of the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, the official residence of the Vice President of the United States. Her work involved green building practices and was certified through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program. Following flood damage to her home in 2003, Kennedy oversaw a massive salvage job and green rebuild project known as the Kennedy Green House Project. In 1998 she co- founded the Food Allergy Initiative, the largest private fund for food allergy research in the United States. == Personal life == Kennedy married Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the brother of Kerry Kennedy, on April 15, 1994, aboard a research vessel on the Hudson River. They had four children: John Conor Richardson Kennedy, Kyra LeMoyne Kennedy, William Finbar Kennedy, and Aidan Caohman Vieques Kennedy. She was the stepmother of Robert Francis Kennedy III and Kathleen Alexandra Kennedy, her husband's two children from his previous marriage to Emily Ruth Black. On May 12, 2010, Kennedy's husband filed for divorce. Three days later she was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. She reportedly struggled with alcoholism and substance abuse. A court ordered that full temporary custody of her children be granted to her estranged husband. === Death === On May 16, 2012, Kennedy was found dead at her home in Bedford, New York. Her death was ruled as a suicide by hanging. An autopsy report revealed that she had antidepressants in her blood system. Her funeral, organized by the Kennedy family, was held at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Bedford, New York. On May 21, 2012 a memorial service organized by the Richardson family was held at the Standard Hotel in Manhattan. A legal battle between her husband and her brother, Thomas W. Richardson, ensued over which family should have control over her remains. The incident has been cited as another example of the Kennedy curse. == References == Category:1959 births Category:2012 deaths Mary Category:American women architects Category:American women interior designers Category:American women philanthropists Category:American Roman Catholics Category:American socialites Category:Brown University alumni Category:Female suicides Category:Rhode Island School of Design alumni Category:Suicides by hanging in New York (state) Category:Sustainable building in the United States Category:People from Bayonne, New Jersey Category:The Putney School alumni ","title":"Mary Richardson Kennedy"},{"id":"35849598","text":"For Italian football transfers summer 2009 see the following articles: *List of Italian football transfers summer 2009 (co-ownership) *List of Italian football transfers summer 2009 (July) *List of Italian football transfers summer 2009 (August) Tran 2009 Italy ","title":"List of Italian football transfers summer 2009"},{"id":"35849607","text":"(with the part in German translated: Girls and Tanks) is a Japanese anime franchise created by Actas which depicts a competition between girls' high schools practicing tank warfare as a sport.

The game servers were taken down on the 27th of November 2019, despite the game still being acquirable via download. ===Collaboration projects=== A collaborative project between the Girls und Panzer animation team and Belarusian computer game developer Wargaming was unveiled in 2013, aiming to promote the online multiplayer video game World of Tanks in Japan. Part of the collaboration involved the promotion of the game in Japan in the form of advertising and local events, as Wargaming focused to penetrate the Japanese market. The South-East Asian game server for World of Tanks featured a tutorial documentation in the form of manga, titled . Drawn by Midori Hagi, it features Girls und Panzer characters as they learned how to play the game. The manga game tutorial is available in English, Thai, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese; it depicts the five members of Ōarai Girls High's Anglerfish sensha-dō team as they learn how to play World of Tanks, intending to explain the game's basics to new players in an entertaining and interesting manner. The tutorial manga also had a side effect of introducing Girls und Panzer to many World of Tanks players, increasing its popularity amongst the players in the Asian region. Girls und Panzer-themed mods for the game were announced at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show; these game mods were distributed as free downloads for players in the South-East Asian server, mainly targeting the Japanese-speaking community. Initially, there were six voice packs released, featuring the voices of all five members of the Anglerfish team, as well as a special voice pack for Nonna, the vice captain of Pravda's sensha-dō team; each of the five crew members of the Anglerfish team voices the five different crew positions in World of Tanks: Commander, Gunner, Loader, Radio Operator, and Driver. The voice packs replaces the standard crew voices with the Girls und Panzer character voices, when tank commands such as \\"Target acquired!\\" or \\"Reloading!\\" sound in the game. The voice packs, however, are only available in Japanese. Afterwards, a garage mod was released, where players could change the regular game garage to the sensha-dō garage square in Ōarai Girls High's Academy Ship. Another mod that was released allowed players to change the skins of a few select tanks in the game to the paint jobs of the tanks in the Girls und Panzer anime. Tanks include the Panzer IV H of Ōarai Girls High, the Churchill VII of St. Gloriana Girls Academy and the Jagdtiger of Kuromorimine Girls High. The last mod that was made available changed the look of destroyed tanks for certain vehicles; instead of a smoking wreck of metal that is shown when a tank is destroyed, the tank is shown in a moderate condition, with a white flag on top, similar to when tanks are knocked out in Girls und Panzer, to indicate that the tank is destroyed. These mods were later made available together in a mod pack that is free to download on the South-East Asian server of World of Tanks. On 31 January 2016, the World of Tanks South-East Asian server released an updated version of the Girls und Panzer-themed mod pack, in celebration of the release of Girls und Panzer der Film. It features the voices of the Anglerfish sensha- dō team and replaces the standard game garage with the Ōarai Girls High School Tank Garage. It also features a lot of new tank skins, such as the Panzer IV D of Ōarai Girls High, before it was converted into the Ausführung H model, and the T95, M24 Chaffee, and the M26 Pershing of the university's sensha-dō team, in addition to all the previous ones released in earlier mods. ==Reception== The initial television airing of the first 10 episodes within 2012 received favourable television ratings and strong viewership. The relatively early airing timeslot of the show allowed the series to gain better exposure to more viewers. Blu-ray sales of the first anime volume in Japan reached third place on the Oricon charts in mid-February 2013, whilst sales of the second anime volume Blu-ray reached second place in late February with 24,733 copies sold within the first week of release. The third Blu-ray volume met with similar success during March, with 23,528 copies sold within the first week, peaking at third place behind Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha the Movie 2nd A's.

The first week sales of both the 5th and 6th Blu-ray volumes placed first in the weekly Oricon chart, having reached 33,450 units and 32,385 units respectively. The first week sales of the Girls und Panzer: This is the Real Anzio Battle! OVA Blu-ray placed third in the weekly Oricon chart, having reached 35,909 units. Plastic models of tanks based on those within the anime have topped sales charts in Japan. In celebration of the popularity of the anime series and to promote local tourism, on 24 March 2013 the town of Ōarai in Ibaraki Prefecture held an event themed along the Girls und Panzer anime, as part of its yearly spring festival. The event featured live tank demonstrations and the sale of anime- themed merchandise. An opinion piece published on 22 January 2013 in the ', a subsidiary of the state-owned People's Liberation Army Daily, criticized the anime for promoting \\"militarist sentiments behind the guise of cute characters.\\" Famitsu gave the video game adaptation Girls und Panzer: Senshadō, Kiwamemasu! a review score of 23/40. PlayStation LifeStyle gave the game 8/10, highly praising the tank battles for their simplicity and the story for its charm. The game sold 31,526 physical retail copies within the first week of release in Japan. ==Trivia== Nicholas Moran (aka The Chieftan) was the resident expert on Girls und Panzer ==FootnotesReferences(via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine) * Category:2012 anime television series Category:2012 manga Category:2014 anime films Category:2014 video games Category:2015 video games Category:2018 video games Category:Actas Category:Action anime and manga Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Bandai Namco franchises Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:IOS games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Media Factory manga Category:Military in anime and manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:PlayStation Vita-only games Category:Seinen manga Category:Sentai Filmworks Category:Seven Seas Entertainment titles Category:Fictional motorsports in anime and manga Category:Tanks in fiction Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Girls und Panzer"},{"id":"35849609","text":"Banca Mediolanum S.p.A. is an Italian bank, insurance and asset management conglomerate which is the parent company of Gruppo Mediolanum (Mediolanum Group).

Stilts are poles, posts or pillars used to allow a structure or building to stand at a distance above the ground.

The length of stilts may vary widely; stilts of traditional houses can be measured half meter to 5 or 6 meters. In Indonesia, the construction of the house symbolizes the division of the macrocosm into three regions: the upper world; the seat of deities and ancestors, the middle world; the realm of human, and lower world; the realm of demon and malevolent spirit. The typical way of buildings in Southeast Asia is to build on stilts, an architectural form usually combined with a saddle roof. Stilts can be found in Indonesian vernacular architecture such as Dayak long houses, Torajan Tongkonan, Minangkabau Rumah Gadang, and Malay houses. The construction is known locally as Rumah Panggung (lit: \\"stage house\\") houses built on stilts. This was to avoid wild animals and floods, to deter thieves, and for added ventilation. In Sumatra, traditionally stilted houses are designed in order to avoid dangerous wild animals, such as snakes and tigers.

Her artist name comes from her family name Seo written in capital letters.Andrea Schulte- Peevers Berlin Encounter - Page 139 2010 \\"It also works with internationally well-known Berlin-based figurative painters of the next generation, including Cornelia Schleime, SEO and Römer + Römer, a Russian-German artist couple that we've interviewed (see opposite). == Biography == Seo Soo-Kyoung was born in Gwangju, South Korea in 1977. She attended Gwangju Art High School () from 1992 to 1996. From 1996 to 2000 she studied at Chosun University, also in Gwangju, receiving the award for the best student of the year upon her graduation. She left South Korea the same year to take up her studies at the Universität der Künste (University of the Arts) in Berlin, in 2001, as a member of the class of famous painter Georg Baselitz. In 2002, while she was still attending her basic course, the South Korean embassy commissioned SEO to design the United Buddy Bear on behalf of her native country. Together with the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, she unveiled this Buddy Bear at the exhibition opening to launch this international art event.Klaus and Eva Herlitz: United Buddy Bears - World Tour, Neptun Verlag AG, 2006, , page 158 She finished the basic course in 2003 supplementing this by the Master Course (2003–2004) thus becoming a \\"Meisterschülerin“ (Master Disciple) of Baselitz. The Master Disciple is the highest degree conferred on artist by art academies in Germany. In 1999 she started exhibiting her works in Galleries and museums both in South Korea, Germany and internationally, and continues to do so.See Gerhard Charles Rump, Eine ganz große Zukunft. Ein Porträt der jungen koreanischen Malerin Seo, die von Deutschland aus die Kunstwelt erobern will, in: DIE WELT, August 2nd, 2003. == Works == Although SEO counts as an artist, her works can also be seen as mixed media images. Usually a blank canvas is used to draw a preliminary design, which is then filled out by a large number of pieces of torn rice (mulberry or tetrapanax) paper pasted onto the canvas. Some of the paper used is printed especially for her in South Korea, especially the paper with patterns designed by herself. In the next step she applies thin and (semi-) transparent layers of paint to form the final image.See Bettina Krogemann, Synthetische Welten: SEO. Hanji-Papier, Reispapier, Berlin, Korea, in: Weltkunst 8/2010, pp. 114-116. First she developed a linear style of painting, with whitish lines aiding the definition of the figures, circumscribing the virtual contour. The white lines, however, should be seen as narrow bands of pure painting, with changing hues and densities, creating a match between micro- and macro-structural elements. She embraced European Culture, without giving up her Asian background, also engaging in “cultural reconstruction”, like when she reconstructs the spirit of German Romanticism in her paintings. There is also a blending of the conceptual and the ideal which leads to something definitely new, a process of “Creolization”.“Creolization” is a term coined by Okwui Enwezor. The Nigeraian was curator of “documenta 11” in Kassel, Germany, he later was Dean and Vice- President of the San Francisco Art Institute to become director of the “Haus der Kunst” exhibition space in Munich, Germany. The concept is seen as an opposition to anything “multicultural”, as in creolization something new is created, different from its sources. See: Jacqueline Knörr, Kreolität und postkoloniale Gesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main: Campus Verlag 2007, esp. p. 63 ; and Enwezor, Basualdo, Bauer: Creolite und Kreolisierung, Plattform 3 zur Documenta 11, St.Lucia/Martinique, November 2001, Ostfildern, Hatje Cantz Verlag 2003; . In the course of her development the linear element slowly became less prominent, her color scheme all the more poignant. The reaction to everyday issues both in life and politics, in art and culture lead to statements about these subjects on the basis of an aesthetic concept, which also embodies in a definition of the picture as a moment taken out of the unlimited context of the eternal stream of images in the mind, pinpointing not objects, but the essence of things. The larger part of her work is created in groups of images around a certain idea, motif or concept, like, among others, the series \\"My German Dreams\\", \\"Rice Fields\\", the \\"War\\" and the \\"Water lilies\\" series. In all groups there are very large formats, but the \\"Water lilies\\" tend to be especially monumental. In the exhibition in the Kunsthalle Rostock, \\"close encounter – robert rauschenberg – seo\\" in 2008 she showed a very large size painting with a lake and waterlilies and mountains in the background. The landscape was composed of images of really existing landscapes from different countries, making it a symbol of the world, The water lilies referred to all 47 species of water lilies, also making the rendering a symbol, besides its alluding to Monet, who was at the height of his water lily-images exactly 100 years earlier. The image consisted of more than 1 million paper scraps.See \\"close encounter – robert rauschenberg – seo\\", Kunsthalle Rostock, June 26 to September 9, 2008. SEO's \\"Meine deutschen Träume\\" (\\"My German Dreams\\") deals with her experiences and relation with Germany. She treats and quotes Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Caspar David Friedrich und Carl Spitzweg, and the sculptural works accompanying the paintings are cast in \\"German silver\\" (i. e. nickel silver, Argantan, alpacca) and show what for her is essentially German: beer barrels (Gemütlichkeit), garden gnomes (contemplativeness), stags’ antlers (power) and – cows. The latter stand for milk and cheese, as Europeans smell, for Asians, like milk. This is a form of cultural reconstruction, as both cultures are treated on the level of subject matter and style. Also the reconstruction of the emotional structure of a certain era embeds possibilities of new, contemporary insights.See Gerhard Charles Rump, Rekonstruktionen. Positionen zeitgenössischer Kunst, Berlin, B&S; Siebenhaar Verlag 2010, pp. 15-20. More recently SEO has widened her range. In an exhibition, \\"Personal Structures\\" at Palazzo Bembo, within the framework of the 2011 Venice Biennale,Announcement on \\"Venice Exhibitions\\". SEO showed an installation of four of her concentric abstract \\"Energy\\" paintings in a dialogue with a box lit from the bottom with assorted rock crystals (German diamonds). She has also started to work with photography as one of her artistic media. A series of her photographs of a light bulb was published in the \\"art.es\\" magazine #47.See the magazine's homepage.

He was a member of the Board of Design Consultants for the construction of the United Nations headquarters together with Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer. ==Childhood== Vilamajó was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was the son of Ramón Vilamajó, a merchant born in Perpignan, France, and Eustaquia Echaniz, a native from San Sebastián in Spain. He was a pupil at School No. 24 in Montevideo from 1901–1903 and finished primary school at Colegio Sagrada Familia between 1904 and 1906. His grandfather, Josef Agustín Echaniz, was also an architect. ==1910–1924 Education, early works and travel== Vilamajó was only 20 years of age when he graduated from the Faculty of Architecture in 1915. His education was based on the classical guidelines of the École des Beaux-Arts, during a period of transition to modern architecture. He was an outstanding student who excelled in the area of design. Starting in 1916, he decorated the auditorium of the Ateneo in Montevideo (with Horacio Azzarini), and refurbished José Enrique Rodó high school and several houses. He also received second prize in the competition for the headquarters of the Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay and the Felipe Sanguinetti school building. These early works are characterized by an eclectic style, using references to the past mixed with modern architectural concepts, which became a trademark for Vilamajó's work. In 1917, Vilamajó began to teach at the School of Architecture and was appointed Adjunct Professor of Architectural Design, after a competitive selection process. In 1920, he applied for the annual competition organized by the School of Architecture intended to increase the training of its graduates abroad. His project, \\"Palace to serve as headquarters of the League of Nations\\" won the Grand Prize, which provided the funding for study abroad. In July 1921, Vilamajó traveled to Europe in the midst of its World War I reconstruction and remained there until December, 1924. He visited many European countries such as Netherlands, Italy and Greece, but spent most of his time moving between France and Spain, working for a construction company in Paris. The company specialized in the mass-production of housing. Attracted by the Hispano-Arabic culture, he extended his stay and traveled to Andalusia, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. He visited the Ramblas (promenade) and the Montjuic and studied the work of Gaudí in Barcelona. In Granada, he visited Alhambra and Generalife. He then traveled to Italy and Greece. ==1924–1928== Casa de Felipe Yriart The Vilamajó, Pucciarelli & Carve Company, founded in 1926, buillt more than twenty homes in the city of Montevideo. The meticulous attention paid to details in these houses was unusual. Some of the highlights of this work are the Palacio Santa Lucia, the Giacomo Pucciarelli apartment blocks, the Augusto Pérsico and the Felipe Yriart residence. These buildings demonstrate a clear, almost exclusive Iberian influence. ==1929–1936== In 1929, Vilamajó resumed his position as adjunct professor at the School of Architecture. In July 1929, he won first prize at the competition for the Club Atlético Peñarol Stadium and, a month later, he won first prize at the competition for building the BROU - General Flores branch. In October, he was awarded first prize for the Centro de Almaceneros Minoristas project, a complex of apartments, shops, offices and a movie theater. In 1930, he married Mercedes Pulido, who had been his girlfriend since his teenage years. He built their own home in Montevideo; it is now the Vilamajó House Museum. This was a time of transition when Vilamajó began to move from a historical to a humanist standpoint, seeking to balance logic and rationality in his construction projects. In 1931, Vilamajó and a coatings manufacturer named Debernardis, became concerned about the housing demand, and created and patented a building system (the Vibro-Econo) which comprised pieces of concrete manufactured in series. ==1936–1948== School of Engineering facade The most representative works of this period are the Monument to the Argentine-Uruguayan Confraternity of Buenos Aires, the School of Engineering, Mesón de las Cañas, Ventorrilo de la Buena Vista, and El Mirador hotel in Colonia. In 1936, Vilamajó won first prize, along with sculptor Antonio Pena, for the Monument to the Peoples' Confraternity project in Buenos Aires. He began construction of the School of Engineering building in the same year. In 1959, Richard Neutra visited the country. A group or architects took him to see the city and nothing seemed to attract him, until he stopped in front of the School of Engineering. He asked who was the author of the work and commented in praise: \\"it is the work of a master, the Japanese are just now discovering concrete.\\" In 1942, Vilamajó began teaching project subjects for 4th and 5th years at the School of Architecture, after the demise of long-time teacher, Joseph Carré. In 1944, he was commissioned to create the Annex Storage to Confitería La Americana. In 1945, Vilamajó was appointed director of the urban development plan for Villa Serrana. In 1946, he built Ventorrillo de la Buena Vista, and in 1947, he began the construction of Mesón de las Cañas. United Nations Headquarters in New York City, view from Roosevelt Island In 1947, Vilamajó was selected as an external consultant for the building of the United Nations headquarters. He was part of an international group of architectural consultants chosen by the project coordinator, the American architect Wallace Harrison. Le Corbusier was also part of this group, while the Brazilian, Oscar Niemeyer and Julio Vilamajó were the only Latin Americans. Le Corbusier insisted for the rest of his life that his proposal, called \\"scheme 23A”, had been the design chosen, but his plan was highly modified to incorporate parts of the design submitted by Niemeyer, specifically, altering Le Corbusier's one-building design into a complex of buildings. The rivalry and tension that was generated by this New York assignment aggravated his hypertension, and he was quite ill when the consulting teamwork was done and he came back to Uruguay. Wallace Harrison, the project coordinator, acknowledged Vilamajó's work on the project in a note to Vilamajó in which he said: \\"I can't let you leave the country without first telling you how much I personally appreciate the sacrifice you did at the expense of your health, by staying until completing the United Nation studies. Your help on this project has been beyond value and it's been a great pleasure working in close contact with you these few last months.\\" After the consulting team's last work session, Harrison had to choose an advisory team to monitor progress. He selected G. A. Soilleux (Australia), M. Nowicki (Poland), J. Havlicek ( Czechoslovakia), P. Noskov (U.S.S.R.), and Vilamajó from the original group of consultants and advisors. Vilamajó kept working from Montevideo, despite his health issues, until he died in 1948. ==Further reading== * Bossi, A.: Julio Vilamajo : disegni per l’ arrendamento. Ed. Oxiana.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore. == History  Beginnings === John McElroy In 1823 Father John McElroy began negotiations with the Sisters of Charity for the establishment of a school for girls in Frederick, Maryland. In 1824, the St. John's Benevolent Female Free School was founded by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph at 200 East Second Street, Frederick, Maryland. The Sisters ran the school for 22 years until they withdrew from Frederick in order to join the congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph at Emmitsburg, Maryland. Before departing, it was arranged that Visitation Sisters from Georgetown, in Washington D.C., would take control of the school. On September 11, 1846 eleven Visitation Sisters arrived in Frederick, Maryland and founded the Visitation Academy.Williams and McKinsey (1910). History of Frederick County, Maryland, Volume 1, p. 381,446-447,510-511. Genealogical Publishing Company, Baltimore. . === Civil War === The Visitation Academy was not untouched by the American Civil War. During the period leading up to the start of the war, many students were recalled to their homes. Throughout the war no single event had a more lasting effect on the Visitation Academy than the Battle of Antietam. In the hours and days that followed the battle fought on September 17, 1862, casualties were moved from Sharpsburg to Frederick, Maryland. The number of casualties quickly overwhelmed the single hospital, and 19 other buildings including the Visitation Academy, were quickly converted into 'Asylums for the sick'. This unfortunate event saw the return of the Sisters of Charity, from Emmitsburg, Maryland, who arrived to help nurse the wounded. During the chaos, daily instruction continued for the 60 remaining students. === Campus === RearView Frederick Academy of the Visitation Visitation Academy Chapel When established in 1846, the Visitation Academy consisted of a large three-story building sitting on a 5,580 square foot plot of land. The sisters purchased an additional 3 acres surrounding the original building in order to expand the school and construct an official monastery with cloistered gardens.\\"History, Arrival in Frederick=The Visitation Academy Website\\". . Retrieved 2012-05-15. * 1847 Expansion – Due to a rapid increase in attendance, the south wing was added to the existing building. * 1851 Expansion - An east wing was added to the main building. The east wing housed a chapel and the monastery proper. * 1860 Expansion – A Hall was added to the south wing. The Chapel Added in the 1851 expansion, the Corinthian style chapel physically separates the monastery from the school. The main altar is constructed of marble and an oil painting depicting \\"The Presentation in the Temple\\" is hung above the altar. Two stained glass windows created by Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany frame the altar. The windows depict the founders of the Visitation Order. The left window is an image of St. Francis de Sales and the right window is an image of St. Jane de Chantal. ===Departure of the Sisters=== In the spring of 2005 the Visitation Monastery closed its doors as an act delivered from the Vatican. The remaining 3 Visitation Sisters were transferred to the Monastery of the Visitation of Holy Mary Monte Maria in Rockville, Virginia.Hernandez, Nancy. \\"Sisters of the Cloth\\" The Frederick News Post, Frederick, 15 March 2005. ===Boarders=== When the Sisters of the Visitation arrived at the school in 1846 they found 10 boarders waiting for them. Boarders were housed in a dormitory located in the south wing. In the early years boarders arrived from almost every state in the Union. Towards the end of their existence at the Visitation Academy, they came primarily from Mexico and South America, in many cases attending for only one year to learn English. Boarders were phased out in 2005 with the closing of the Visitation Monastery, since the Sisters would no longer be on-site to care for them after school hours.Waters Jr., Ed. \\"Visitation Academy sold to local owners\\" The Frederick News Post, Frederick, 07 May 2009. ===Academy Ownership=== In 1846 the property was deeded to the St. John's Institute by the Sisters of Charity, which was then turned over to the Sisters of the Visitation. In 2009, 4 years after the departure of the Sisters of the Visitation from the Visitation Academy, the Academy was sold by the Sisters of the Visitation to a group formally known as the Visitation Academy Inc. == Academics == The Visitation Academy has been known for academic excellence for over 165 years. Classes include a traditional curriculum of language arts, math, science, social studies, physical education and geography. The traditional curriculum is enriched with art, music, dance, public speaking, Spanish, computer/technology education and life skills; With their current STEM curriculum they are creating a state of the art STEM center. The Visitation is also in an IB candidacy for their middle school years.

The students did not embrace the Sisters upon their arrival and began a hunger strike. The neighbors on East Second Street were sympathetic to the Visitation Sisters and made them dinner. The meal was brought in and shared by the Sisters with the students. Apple dumplings were served for dessert and as the sweet dessert was shared a bond was created between the Sisters and the students. This event was recreated annually until the late 1990s when the Sisters were no longer able to bake apple dumplings due to aging and failing health. Upon the departure of the Sisters from the Visitation Academy in 2005, the girls restarted Apple Dumpling Day in order to pay homage to the Sisters and order of the Visitation. Today the tradition is strong. All of the Visitation girls take part in Apple Dumpling Day from the pre-kindergarten through 2nd grade students, who harvest the apples off the campus apple tree, to the 3rd through 8th graders who bake the dumplings.Ames, Blair. \\"The apple dumpling gang: Academy tradition reaches 165 years\\", The Frederick News Post, Frederick, 7 October 2011. === Service of Lights === The Service of Lights tradition began in the 1950s, and continues today as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.\\"Student Life, Academy Traditions=The Visitation Academy Website\\". .

The team is drawn from the Skadik (Skadron Pendidikan / Training Squadron) 102, Adisucipto International Airport, Yogyakarta. The Jupiter team aircraft are equipped with white smoke generators. The pilots of the \\"Jupiter Aerobatic Team (JAT)\\" are all instructors. The team is named \\"JUPITER\\" after the call- sign of Indonesian Air Force instructors. ==History== In 1996, a new Indonesian Air Force aerobatic team was formed and equipped with eight BAE Hawk Mk. 53 planes from Skadik 103. This team was named \\"Jupiter\\" and they performed for the first time on September 23, 1997. In 2001, the team became \\"Jupiter Blue\\" after merging with the \\"Elang Biru\\" team, which was disbanded due to financial crisis in late 1990s. The \\"Jupiter Aerobatic Team\\" (JAT) was re-formed in 2008, using 4 Korean Aerospace Industries KT-1B Wongbee trainers. This new team's first public show was on July 4, 2008 in Yogyakarta and their second show was in Jakarta in November 2008. In 2010, after two years of stagnation, JAT began a training program with help from Australian Roulettes display team. In September 2010, two JAT pilots were sent to Australia to observe and practice flying maneuvers together with the Roulettes at their home base in East Sale, Victoria, Australia. On November 8, 2010, the Roulettes then performed in Halim Air Force Base, Jakarta in which six JAT members each had the opportunity to fly in the back seat of the \\"Roulettes\\" PC-9s during their practice. In 2011, the JAT increased to six aircraft in the formation and also received a new red-white color livery similar to the colors of the Indonesian flag. The first demonstration with this new six-ship composition was on March 16, 2011 in Yogyakarta at the launching of the new livery ceremony by the Indonesian Air Force. Their second airshow was on April 9 in Jakarta at the TNI AU's 65th anniversary and their third was on April 17, 2011, again in Yogyakarta. ==Maneuver SequenceCurrent MembersFormer Membersshow listIncidents== On March 15, 2015, during a practice for LIMA 15', two aircraft (tail no.5 and no.6) clipped their wings in mid-air and crashed. All four crew of both aircraft ejected safely and suffered minor injuries. One of the aircraft crashed close to a house, setting it on fire and damaging nearby property, while the other crashed into an empty field. No ground injuries were reported as the house was unoccupied at the time of the accident. Indonesian First Force Marshal Indra Yadi later made the decision to pull the JAT out from LIMA 15' aerial display. ==References== *Video Jupiter Aerobatic Team Category:Aerobatic teams Category:Indonesian Air Force ","title":"Jupiter Aerobatic Team"},{"id":"35849862","text":"Rumnicus costatus is a species of beetles in the family Monotomidae, the only species in the genus Rumnicus.Monotomidae Species List at Joel Hallan’s Biology Catalog.

Later instar larvae are physogastric (swollen posteriorly), with simple setae, short unsegmented legs, and reduced mouthparts. Passandridae consists of 109 described species in nine genera. Only Passandra Dalman occurs in both the Old and New Worlds, being represented in the Neotropical region by a single species, P. fasciata (Gray). The genera Ancistria, Aulonosoma, Nicolebertia, and Passandrina are restricted to the Old World, while Catogenus, Passandrella, Scalidiopsis, and Taphroscelidia are found only in the New World. Only Catogenus and Taphroscelidia occur in the Nearctic. The largest genus is Ancistria, with 34 described species. ==References== Category:Cucujoidea families ","title":"Passandridae"},{"id":"35850096","text":"The fourth season of Drop Dead Diva premiered on June 3, 2012 and concluded on September 9, 2012, on Lifetime.

Developed and opened by Vauxhall Motors in 1942 under instruction from the Ministry of Production as a shadow factory, it was transferred to the Bedford Vehicles unit in the 1950s. Closed after receivership in 1992, it was subsequently demolished and redeveloped as a retail park and associated industrial estate. ==Background== In 1931, the now General Motors owned Vauxhall launched a bus and truck division called Bedford Vehicles. Produced at the companies existing Luton site, the first Bedford's were reworked Chevrolet vehicles. Bedford introduced their first own original design, the Q series lorries and buses, turning itself into a distinctive marque. By the start of World War II, Bedford had become a major supplier to the British Army, with the Q series being used in every possible configuration. Those destined for D-Day were waterproof tested at Wardown Park lake. In preparation for the main assault, the Ministry of Production asked Vauxhall to produce the Churchill Tank, which would require the company to access additional production. hence with Government money, the company agreed to open a new site in Dunstable. ==History== The plant opened on a site in Boscombe Road, Dunstable in 1942. As much of the output was destined for the war effort, the factory was served by the Dunstable Branch Lines, which both brought raw materials and sub-assemblies in, and took finished products out. In the 1950s, the decision was made to move all truck and bus production from Luton to Dunstable, although Luton retained van production until the demise of the Bedford brand at the end of the 1980s. GM invested in two new double story factories, built between 1955 and 1957, which covered an area of . The resultant production line was long, and the entire site employed 5,500 people, on an average wage of £10 per week. The later developed Commer lorry factory was located on the far side of Boscombe Road. ===1980s=== By the 1980s, Bedford's main markets were in military vehicle production (TL and TM series) and producing bus chassis for the cheaper end of the coach market. But already the factory was downsizing, and shedding jobs. The major blow came when Bedford failed to win the UK Ministry of Defence contract to produce the standard 4 ton 4x4 GS (general service) truck for the British forces. This was despite the fact that the Bedford candidate had performed equally in extensive test to the Leyland (later Leyland DAF) candidate, and the British Army expressed a preference to continue the trusted relationship with Bedford trucks. The reasons for this decision were seen by many as political, as the Army 4 tonner contract was seen by the Thatcher government as essential for the long-term survival of Leyland and the formation of Leyland-DAF. The implications of the decision were also noted by GM in Detroit, who had already been refused permission to buy the Land Rover division of British Leyland, which they had intended to operate in tandem with the Bedford Truck division as major force a military and civilian 4x4 market. With cheaper far-Eastern sourced and more technically advanced vehicles now available on the commercial market, GM took the decision to concentrate the Bedford brand on light vans, which would be re-badged Isuzu models assembled at Luton. The decision was taken to sell the Bedford brand and Dunstable site. ===David John Bowes Brown and AWD=== The Dunstable site and associated and business was sold in 1987 to AWD Ltd, a company owned by David John Bowes Brown. The AWD name was used as GM would only allow the use of the Bedford name for military trucks. David John Bowes Brown was the designer in 1973 of the then DJB D250 Articulated Dump Truck, built in Peterlee, England, by DJB Engineering Ltd. DJB was renamed Artix in 1985 when the trucks were rebadged as Caterpillar.Caterpillar Chronicle, by Eric C. Orlemann, pub by MBI, Artix itself was sold to Caterpillar in 1996. AWD continued with the TL and TM range. The AWD Bedford TK (a rebadged and modernised version of the Bedford TK/MK range) was also produced and supplied to the British military. Due to cheaper competition and the virtual collapse of the UK market in which AWD competed in 1989/90, the company went into receivership in 1992. The AWD brand was bought by dealer network Marshall of Cambridge, while the Dunstable site was to be redeveloped by the receiver. ==Redevelopment== Conrad Ritblat had been instructed to carry out a redevelopment and planning appraisal in 1987. The team was led by John Riding and they successfully obtained retail consent for part of the site. The former warehouse of 8,000m2 attached to the main factory was let. The Receivers (KPMG) began demolishing the oldest buildings in 1993. The area towards Dunstable Road was the first to be redeveloped, with a Sainsbury's supermarket (already pre-let by Conrad Ritblat) the initial core of a retail development that included units occupied by McDonald's and Kwik-Fit. In 1997 more single-storey buildings were demolished and a new retail park was built north of Sainsbury's, which presently includes a Staples, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Currys and a DFS furniture outlet. The two 1950s factories were rented out as distribution space, to companies that included IKEA. These were eventually demolished in 2005, together with the works iconic water tower. The replacement modern distribution units are now occupied by companies that include Cinram UK Ltd, Superdrug Ltd and Christian Salvesen, who operate a parts distribution contract for IBC Vehicles, one of the successors to Bedford and Commer, and Renault Trucks. ==References== * Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Bedfordshire Category:British shadow factories Category:Vauxhall Motors Category:Opel factories Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1942 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1992 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Manufacturing plants in England Category:1942 establishments in England ","title":"Bedford Dunstable plant"},{"id":"35850233","text":"Five Block is an unincorporated community in Logan County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Logan County, West Virginia ","title":"Five Block, West Virginia"},{"id":"35850238","text":"Anthony Marinelli (born March 19, 1959) is an American musician, composer and conductor. In his early career, he composed and performed accompaniment on the synthesizer for albums including Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983). Marinelli has also recorded with Lionel Richie, Kenny Loggins, Herb Alpert, Supertramp, The Crystal Method, Billy Childs and James Brown. Marinelli was a contributor in the production of Quincy Jones' soundtrack for Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple (1985) and composed for Young Guns (1988), Graveyard Shift (1990), Leaving Las Vegas (1996), and Internal Affairs (2000). Excluding episodic- television and commercials, Marinelli's filmography contains over one hundred feature film credits with an AACTA award nomination for the Australian film My Forgotten Man (1993). For television, he won a Daytime Emmy Honors Award for his work on the TV series Santa Barbara (1986–87). Marinelli has also won four Clio Awards, two AICP Awards, two ADDY Awards, three Indian Telly Awards and a Cannes Silver Lion Award for his musical contributions on television commercials. He composed the music for the infamous \\"Fried Egg\\" version of This Is Your Brain on Drugs television commercial. Marinelli co-founded, incubated and hosted Levels Audio Post, a post production service; the venture serviced the television shows: American Idol (Fox), The Bachelor (ABC), the Teen Choice Awards (Fox) and the MTV Award Shows. In musical theatre, Marinelli completed BollyDoll, a Bollywood genre extravaganza with visual artist and vocalist, Amrita Sen, directed by Shekhar Kapur in 2013. ==Background== Anthony Marinelli is the son of Carmine Marinelli(Born in Vinchiaturo, Molise), the former Master of Properties at the Dorothy Chandler performing arts center. Marinelli took an interest in his father's work and was exposed to operas, ballet, musicals and symphonies during his childhood. Marinelli was personally introduced to Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra, Zubin Mehta and Katharine Hepburn. He attended the annual Academy Award ceremonies with his family, beginning at age nine. ===Influences=== Marinelli decided on a career in music after hearing Switched-On Bach (1968) by Wendy Carlos. In addition to classical composers, other early influences were Keith Emerson, Keith Jarrett, John Williams, Ennio Morricone, and Jerry Goldsmith. Marinelli credits Arthur B. Rubinstein, Jack Nitzche, Quincy Jones and Giorgio Moroder as his mentors. === Education === Marinelli's piano lessons began at age six and he was performing with Lamont Dozier and other Motown artists professionally by age sixteen. He studied piano and music theory under Lowndes Maury from 1967 to 1975. He studied synthesizer under Clark Spangler (1975–80), and continued piano under Terry Trotter (1976–80), Spud Murphy (music composition from 1978–85) and Hans Beer (conducting from 1993–99). Marinelli studied jazz improvisation under Charlie Shoemake from 1978 to 1982. In 1977, Marinelli graduated with the first coed class at Providence High School in Burbank, California. He studied piano and music composition at the University of Southern California School of Music and played the Los Angeles jazz circuit with the band Night Flight, featuring Billy Childs and vocalist Dianne Reeves. Marinelli attended USC from 1977 to 1982, but withdrew with film and recording project offers pending. Marinelli was one of ten conductors selected to attend the fourth annual BMI Film Conducting Workshop in 2001. === Personal life === Marinelli and his wife Cynthia live with their three children in the Los Angeles area. Marinelli holds dual-citizenship (United States and Italy); his Italian citizenship is inherited through his father's lineage. He is a licensed soccer coach and has been an LA Galaxy season ticket holder since the team's move to Carson, California in 2003. He has been a patron of the Los Angeles Philharmonic since 1980 and is a founding member of the Electronic Music Alliance (EMA). ==Synclavier synthesizers== Marinelli became interested in analog synthesizers in his teenage years. His piano instructor knew of another student with these interests and introduced Marinelli to Brian Banks. Marinelli and Banks became known for performances as a synthesizer duo, including as an opener for the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1980. Live KFAC radio broadcast classical works such as Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, Fugue in G minor, \\"Little\\", BWV 578, Beethoven Symphony No 8 in F Major, Tchaikovsky Romeo & Juliet Fantasy Overture and other performances as Marinelli's synthesizer group The Synners expanded their reach. Marinelli and Banks then teamed with Emmy Award-winning composer Arthur B. Rubinstein, creating one of the first known digitally synthesized musical scores, Blue Thunder, released in 1983. The trio joined with Cynthia Morrow as The Beepers, and their songs, \\"Video Fever\\" and \\"Long Line Leading To Men\\", made the soundtrack for the 1983 film, WarGames. The Beepers song \\"Theme from Blue Thunder (Murphy's Law)\\" was used in Blue Thunder with an instrumental version closing the film. The film industry expressed interest in synthesizer technology while Banks and Marinelli simultaneously emerged as experts in the practical-application of the new technology. Banks and Marinelli made a \\"polaroid\\" of the Quincy Jones soundtrack for The Color Purple (1985) available to director Steven Spielberg during filming and editing. This process allowed the score to be completely written before orchestral musicians were hired. :\\"...Anthony got very involved with consulting for the development of the Synclavier. A lot of things that are on the instrument are our fault! It's a nice feeling to be involved in the development of a musical instrument.\\" ::—Brian Banks, \\"Synthesizer Upstarts Conquer Hollywood\\", Keyboard, Sept. 1987, by Jeff Burger ==Studio CEO== From 1977 to 1983, Marinelli's Synner Productions worked from a converted pool-house at his parents' home, eventually equipped with a New England Digital Synclavier II, 24 track analog tape and mixer, and Dolby Spectral Recording with noise reduction for film projects. Marinelli moved into digital with a Synclavier Direct to Disk synthesizer and digital tape prior to renovating and moving the studio to a circa 1913, Art Deco style, building at 1606 N Highland in Hollywood. ===Sonar Productions=== From 1983 to 1993, Marinelli and Brian Banks operated and composed out of the three studio complex at the corner of Hollywood Blvd and Highland Blvd as Sonar Productions. The studio was designed by Bret Thoeny and constructed by Marinelli's audio engineer, Mark E. Curry. The team worked individually and together during this time period; notable credits include: WarGames (1984), Starman (1984), The Color Purple (1985), Stand by Me (1985), Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), Young Guns (1988) and Internal Affairs (1990). === Music Forever === Marinelli continued to operate his Hollywood studios as a sole proprietor, establishing the trade name Music Forever in 1993. Marinelli's commercial television award nominations increasingly included wins, among them, an AICP Award and an ADDY Award in 1994 for his Apple Computer campaigns, two Silver Hugo Awards (1997) for his work with Mercedes-Benz, Mobius and Telly awards in 1998 and 1999. In addition to episodic television and documentaries, Marinelli's feature film credits for this period include the critically acclaimed, Leaving Las Vegas (1996), Timecode (2000) and The Man from Elysian Fields (2001). Levels Audio Post Marinelli co-founded and incubated a post-production service company called Levels Audio Post. Conceptualized in October 1998, Marinelli designed and installed a fourth studio in Music Forever Studios and enlisted a mixer, Brian Riordan as his co-founder. Levels Audio Post opened its doors on July 16, 1999. Streamlining the post-production process was accomplished by assigning audio specialists with established musicianship credentials to oversee each project from beginning to end. The ProTools facility featured two mix stages with 5.1 surround sound, 16-foot projection and auxiliary sound design rooms. After early successes in the television commercial genre, their new production technique began to catch on and Audio Levels Post landed the television series American Idol (2001), followed by American Juniors (2003) and MTV's Viva La Bam (2003). Music specials included: Justin Timberlake: Down Home in Memphis (2003), Hilary Duff's Island Bash (2003) and the 2003 MTV Movie Awards. Co-founder Brian Riordan received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination (for mixing) on American Idol in 2003 and The Academy Awards show in 2004. Riordan purchased Marinelli's interest in Levels Audio Post in August 2004 and leased the Levels Audio Post portion of the Hollywood facility from Marinelli for an additional two years. Riordan is a three-time Emmy Award winner. Marinelli and his staff compose from a nondescript location in the San Fernando Valley. == Polaroids (orchestral mockups)== Marinelli explained in a 1987 interview, \\"We did what we call Polaroids— we did the whole score before it was recorded by orchestra.\\"(p. 62) The use of the term \\"polaroids,\\" which are now called orchestral mockups, was borrowed from the Polaroid instant camera, which delivered color prints moments after taking a picture. In a 2007 interview, Quincy Jones reflected briefly on how the polariod concept revolutionized film and recording industry work-flow process. ::Banks and Marinelli spend a lot of time assisting film composers in the studio and were responsible for the first digital synthesis and sampling for a film with \\"Blue Thunder\\" and programmed and performed the first polaroid (orchestral simulation) of the entire musical score for \\"The Color Purple\\". ::\\"As far as we know, this was the first time this had ever been done,\\" Marinelli said. ::::—\\"Sonar Prods. specializes in synthesizing\\", The Hollywood Reporter, by Bill Desowitz, June 4, 1986. Synthesizer technology was a controversial addition to the film industry, a lack of understanding came from professional orchestral musicians. Having a synthesist present can minimize the need to hire larger sections of musicians. Additionally, musician time can be reduced by having the arrangements realized with synthesizers to match the edited film before performing the score with a live orchestra.(pp. 70, 72) Because of these factors, synthesists were initially considered a threat to employment from the musician's union.(p. 72) As musicians, these concerns were not lost on Marinelli and Banks, their proposal for the overdub scale (synthesist's scale) was accepted by the union in 1985. \\"We came up with a proposal that synthesists should be paid by the hour at an inflated rate, with an unlimited amount of overdubs, doubles or anything else they're called upon to do.\\"(p. 72) ==Orchestration and conducting== Orchestral works, which have gained wider recognition for Marinelli, include the score for the biopic Chapter 27 (2007), using a 60 piece orchestra with the score being similar instrumentally to Tchaikovsky's, Nutcracker Suite. In the Family Way was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, featuring the comedy of Julia Sweeney at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25 and 26, 2006. ::Marinelli composed a tone poem, In the Family Way, featuring narration by writer/actress Julia Sweeney, Commissioned by the L.A. Philharmonic, the 22-minute piece, performed for 2 nights with a 90 piece orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl, is based on Sweeny's adoption of a baby from China and her travels as a single parent. :::—\\"Award Winning Film Composer\\", Music Connection, by Dan Kimpel, January 1, 2007 At the onset, the combination of musician, arranger, orchestrator and synthesist was in high demand.(p. 58) Later, Marinelli's credentials and formal training provided the opportunity to also conduct orchestras. Marinelli has stated that he had put his analog synthesizers in storage and had worked without them for about a decade. In addition to composing, Marinelli conducted orchestras on the following feature films: Flynn (1993), Hacks (1997), Gideon (1998), Scar City (1998), The Runner (1999), Slow Burn (2000), 15 Minutes (2001) starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns and The Man from Elysian Fields (2001) starring Andy Garcia, Mick Jagger and Olivia Williams. The made for television films, Don King: Only in America (1997) and Songs in Ordinary Time (2000) were also composed and conducted by Marinelli. ==Film career== Marinelli was exposed to and studied the styles of many modern composers. His early success in the film industry began with the patronage of jazz/pop composer and producer Quincy Jones, classical composer and conductor Arthur B. Rubinstein, pop/disco songwriter and producer Giorgio Moroder, and classic-rock composer and arranger Jack Nitzsche. For Quincy Jones, Marinelli and former partner Brian Banks are credited with performance and synthesizer programming on Michael Jackson's Thriller album including the title track. In film, they provided a pre-production synthesized orchestra recording of Quincy Jones' score for The Color Purple (1985), allowing Jones and Steven Spielberg to adjust the score during editing and present a completed work to the orchestral musicians. The final score for the film was orchestrated rather than synthesized with some exceptions; for instance, the sound of a leaky roof landing in tin-cans in Cilie's living room segues into a musical piece played on an African kalimba. Additional titles where Marinelli has worked on Quincy Jones' productions include: The Slugger's Wife (1985), Tango & Cash (1989) and Cadillac Man (1990). Emmy Award-winning composer and conductor Arthur B. Rubinstein relied on Marinelli and Banks for the Rubinstein scored films, Blue Thunder (1983) and WarGames (1983). Marinelli is also credited on the Rubinstein score for Best of Times (1986), and Marinelli and Banks are credited on Stakeout (1987). Accustomed to working with classically trained musicians, Rubinstein joined in a musical group with Marinelli, Banks and vocalist Cynthia Morrow called The Beepers. Songs from The Beepers include \\"Murphy's Law\\", the theme song for Blue Thunder, \\"Video Fever\\" and \\"History Lesson\\" in WarGames. Three-time Academy Award winner Giorgio Moroder used Marinelli and Banks on the soundtracks for Cat People (1982), Over the Top (1987), Let it Ride (1989). Marinelli's solo work with Moroder includes: The World (1988), The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter (1990), Moroder and Marinelli co-composed the score together for Jackpot (1992). Oscar-winning composer Jack Nitzsche brought Marinelli and Banks industry credit with Streets of Gold (1986) the Oscar nominated films, Starman (1984) and 'Stand By Me' (1986). A significant milestone for Marinelli and Banks was composing the original score to the #1 box-office hit, Young Guns (1988), prior to their ending their partnership in 1993. Still completing numerous feature films per year, Marinelli's responsibilities increased, more often working with directors rather than in support roles under other composers. With the transition from a partnership in Sonar Productions to the sole proprietor of Music Forever, Marinelli also worked on television commercials. Marinelli continued composing with filmmaker and composer Mike Figgis, writing the theme for Leaving Las Vegas in 1995 and co-composing the scores on Internal Affairs (1990), Timecode (2000) and Hotel (2001). Timecode is a 90-minute experimental film, performed live and filmed on four time-synchronized, hand-held digital cameras. Combining music composition techniques with film-making, the script was developed during single-take rehearsal performances by writer/director Figgis and the actors themselves. Each actor recorded personal script notes on blank, four octave, music paper, with each octave representing a camera view and vertical separations representing each minute of camera time capacity. The film is presented with each camera point-of-view as one fourth of the screen, dialog and music determines which of the four screen-frames is the active frame at that particular moment in time. For special screenings in Los Angeles area theaters, Figgis and Marinelli created alternate/spontaneous live mixes of the dialogue and music from the back of the theater. This allowed new story lines to unfold since the audience could hear dialogue from screen frames not active in the original released version. Marinelli scored the critically acclaimed release of George Hickenlooper's Mayor of the Sunset Strip (2004) documentary. The film is a montage of musicians such as (David Bowie, Cher, Blondie); a cast of Rodney Bingenheimer's \\"A-list\\" friends, \\"God heads\\" as he calls them. Bingenheimer is an autograph hound, turned groupie, turned unlikely star-maker via his trendy punk styled club, English Disco and as a long running disc-jockey for KROQ in Los Angeles. A sampling of Marinelli's solitary composing credits for feature film include: The Man from Elysian Fields (2001), starring Andy Garcia and Mick Jagger, the critically acclaimed independent film, Self Medicated (2005), Jarrett Schaefer's controversial, Chapter 27 (2007), a biography of John Lennon's assassination, My Sexiest Year (2007) which gave Marinelli the opportunity to perform and write songs with Dr John, and Jada Pinkett Smith's, The Human Contract (2008). Recent completions include: Altergeist (2014), written and directed by Tedi Sarafian, Medicine Men (2015), starring Liza Weil, Shawn Hatosy and James LeGros, and Midnight Return (2015), written and directed by Sally Sussman Morina. ===Filmography=== Marinelli has scored the following films: * Rigged (aka Hit and Run) (1986) * Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night (1987) * Nice Girls Don't Explode (1987) * Young Guns (1988) * Voyage of De Liefde (1989) * Spooner (1989) * Graveyard Shift (1990) * Internal Affairs (1990) * Fools Rush In (1991) * Jackpot (1992) * House of Secrets (1993) * There Was a Little Boy (1993) * Reckless Kelly (1993) * Marked for Murder (aka The Sandman) (1993) * Flynn (1993) * A Pig's Tale (1994) * Baby Brokers (aka Stolen Hearts) (1994) * The Innocent (1994) * Just Looking (1995) * Fight for Justice: The Nancy Conn Story (1995) * Payback (1995) * 2 Days in the Valley (1996) * Underworld (1996) * Invasion of Privacy (1996) * One Tough Bastard (1996) * Don King: Only in America (1997) * Seed: A Love Story (1997) * Masterminds (1997) * Hacks (1997) * Scar City (aka Scarred City) (1998) * God Said Ha!

The copper advantage, Metal Architecture, June 2009; www.metalarchitecture.com From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper is used for a variety of architectural elements, including roofs, flashings, gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, wall cladding, and building expansion joints. The history of copper in architecture can be linked to its durability, corrosion resistance, prestigious appearance, and ability to form complex shapes.Austin, Jim (2006). Copper: The peacock of metals, Metal Roofing, April–May 2006; www.metalroofingmag.com For centuries, craftsmen and designers utilized these attributes to build aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting building systems.Seale, Wayne (2007). The role of copper, brass, and bronze in architecture and design; Metal Architecture, May 2007 For the past quarter century, copper has been designed into a much wider range of buildings, incorporating new styles, varieties of colors, and different shapes and textures.The Guide to Copper in Architecture; European Copper in Architecture Campaign; http://www.copperconcept.org/sites/default/files/attachment/2011/pubpdf145.pdf Copper clad walls are a modern design element in both indoor and outdoor environments. Some of the world's most distinguished modern architects have relied on copper. Examples include Frank Lloyd Wright, who specified copper materials in all of his building projects; Michael Graves, an AIA Gold Medalist who designed over 350 buildings worldwide;Michael Graves & Associates Renzo Piano, who designed pre-patinated clad copper for the NEMO-Metropolis Museum of Science in Amsterdam;Metal Sight: The source for metal cladding in architecture; http://www.metalsight.com/projects/metropolis/ Malcolm Holzman, whose patinated copper shingles at the WCCO Television Communications Centre made the facility an architectural standout in Minneaoplis;Malcolm Holzman on Design Inspiration, Buildings, April 27, 2009; http://www.buildings.com/tabid/3334/ArticleID/8322/Default.aspx and Marianne Dahlbäck and Göran Månsson, who designed the Vasa Museum, a prominent feature of Stockholm's skyline, with copper cladding.Vasa Museet; http://www.vasamuseet.se/en/About/The-history-of-the-museum/ Architect Frank O.

Copper in architecture, Business Insider, as published in Resource Investing News, March 14, 2012; http://www.businessinsider.com/copper-in-architecture-2012-3 Copper's most famous trait is its display from a bright metallic colour to iridescent brown to near black and finally to a greenish verdigris patina. Architects describe the array of browns as russet, chocolate, plum, mahogany, and ebony.The glory of copper; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003 The metal's distinctive green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers. This article describes practical and aesthetic benefits of copper in architecture as well as its use in exterior applications, interior design elements, and green buildings. ==History== Copper has played a role in architecture for thousands of years. For example, in ancient Egypt, massive doors to the temple of Amen-Re at Karnak were clad with copper. In the 3rd Century B.C., copper roof shingles were installed atop of the Lowa Maha Paya Temple in Sri Lanka. And the Romans used copper as roof covering for the Pantheon in 27 B.C.Copper roofing in detail; Copper in Architecture; Copper Development Association, U.K., http://copperalliance.org.uk/resource- library/pub-156---copper-roofing-in-detail Centuries later, copper and its alloys were integral in medieval architecture. The doors of the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of Hagia Sophia at Constantinople, of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze. Bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 A.D. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 A.D. by Ghiberti.Architecture, European Copper Institute; http://copperalliance.eu/applications/architecture The copper roof of Hildesheim Cathedral, installed in 1280 A.D., survives to this day.Copper Roofing in Detail; Copper in Architecture; Copper Development Association, U.K., Copper Roofing in Detail And the roof at Kronborg, one of northern Europe's most important Renaissance castles that was immortalized as Elsinore Castle in Shakespeare's Hamlet, was installed in 1585 A.D.Kronborg completed; Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties, København, The copper on the tower was renovated in 2009.Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties, Renovation of the Tower of Christianborg Palace., http://www.slke.dk/en/slotteoghaver/slotte/christiansborgslot/hovedslottet/renoveringaftaarnet.aspx?highlight=copper+roof For years, copper was reserved mainly for public institutions, such as churches, government buildings, and universities. Copper roofs are often one of the most architecturally distinguishable features of these structures. Today, architectural copper is used in roofing systems, flashings and copings, rain gutters and downspouts, building expansion joints, wall cladding, domes, spires, vaults, and various other design elements. Simultaneously, the metal has evolved from a weather barrier and exterior design element into indoor building environments where it is changing the way commercial and residential interiors are decorated.Copper's design potential highlights architectural seminars (2008). Building and Architectural News, Vol 62, No. 4., Reprint A4086 xx/08; Copper Development Association In the 21st century, the use of copper continues to evolve in the indoor environment. Its recently proven antimicrobial properties reduce pathogenic bacterial loads on such products as handrails, bedrails, bathroom fixtures, counter tops, etc. These antimicrobial copper-based products are now being incorporated into public facilities (hospitals, nursing homes, mass transit facilities) as well as in residential buildings because of the public health benefits. (For main article, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces.) ==BenefitsCorrosion resistance=== As an architectural metal, copper provides excellent corrosion resistance.Preventing corrosion on copper roof systems, Professional Roofing, October 2004, www.professionalroofing.net Copper surfaces form tough oxide- sulfate patina coatings that protect underlying copper surfaces and resist corrosion for a very long time. Copper corrodes at negligible rates in unpolluted air, water, de-aerated non-oxidizing acids, and when exposed to saline solutions, alkaline solutions, and organic chemicals. Copper roofing in rural atmospheres corrodes at rates of less than in 200 years.Corrosion of copper and copper alloys; Key to Metals: The world's most comprehensive metals database; http://www.keytometals.com/Article16.htm Unlike most other metals, copper does not suffer from underside corrosion that can cause premature failures in roofing. With a copper roof, supporting substrates and structures usually fail long before the copper on the roof. Architectural copper is, however, susceptible to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation in areas with a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere.Peters, Larry E. (2004). Preventing corrosion on copper roofing systems; Professional Roofing, October 2004, www.professionalroofing.net Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems. A copper weather vane as an architectural element Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, has good resistance to atmospheric corrosion, alkalis, and organic acids. In some potable waters and in seawater, however, brass alloys with 20% or more zinc may suffer corrosive attack.Houska, Catherine, 2002; Architectural metals have many capabilities, but also limitations, Snips; Nov 2002; 71, pgs. 12-24; www.snipsmag.com Detail of roofline at Kresge Auditorium, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the U.S. ===Durability/long-life=== Copper roofs are extremely durable in most environments. They have performed well for over 700 years, primarily because of the protective patina that forms on copper surfaces. Tests conducted on 18th Century copper roofs in Europe showed that, in theory, they could last for one thousand years. ===Low thermal movement=== Properly designed copper roofs minimize movements due to thermal changes. Copper's low thermal expansion, 40% less than zinc and lead, helps to prevent deterioration and failure. Also, copper's high melting point ensures that it will not creep or stretch as some other metals do. thumb On small gable roofs, thermal movement is relatively minor and usually is not an issue. On wide-span buildings over and when long panels are used, an allowance for thermal expansion may be necessary. This enables the roof to \\"float\\" over supporting substructures while remaining secure.Metal roofing basics: corrosion, strength and thermal movement are important issues to consider in specifying metal roofs; The Canadian Architect, Vol. 40, Issue 2 (Feb 1995), pp. 31-37 ===Low maintenance=== Copper does not require cleaning or maintenance. It is particularly suited for areas that are difficult or dangerous to access after installation. ===Lightweight=== When used as a fully supported roof covering, copper is half the weight (including substrate) of lead and only a quarter of tiled roofs. This generally provides savings in supporting structure and materials costs. Copper cladding offers additional opportunities to reduce the weight of copper structures (For more details, see: Copper cladding and Wall cladding). ===Ventilation=== Copper does not require complex ventilation measures. It is suitable for both unventilated 'warm' and ventilated 'cold' roof constructions. ===Radio frequency shielding=== Sensitive electronic equipment are vulnerable to interference and unauthorized surveillance. These products also require protection from high voltages. Radio frequency (RF) shielding can address these issues by reducing the transmission of electric or magnetic fields from one space to another. Copper is an excellent material for RF shielding because it absorbs radio and magnetic waves. Other useful properties for RF shielding is that copper has a high electrical conductivity, is ductile, malleable, and solders easily.Radio frequency shielding: Fundamentals; Copper Development Association; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/radio_shielding.html RF shielding enclosures filter a range of frequencies for specific conditions. Properly designed and constructed copper enclosures satisfy most RF shielding needs, from computer and electrical switching rooms to hospital CAT-scan and MRI facilities.Seale, Wayne (2007). The role of copper, brass, and bronze in architecture and design; Metal Architecture, May 2007 Special attention needs to be addressed regarding potential shield penetrations, such as doors, vents, and cables. A shield can be effective against one type of electromagnetic field but not against another. For example, a copper foil or screen RF shield will be minimally effective against power frequency magnetic fields. A power frequency magnetic shield could offer little reduction of radio frequency fields. The same is true for different RF frequencies. A simple large-mesh screen shield can work well for lower frequencies, but can be ineffective for microwaves.EMF shielding and mitigation alternatives; EMF Services Inc; http://www.emfservices.com/emf-shielding.htm Copper galleon finial. Sheet copper for RF shielding can be formed into essentially any shape and size. Electrical connection to a grounding system provides an effective RF enclosure. ===Lightning protection=== Lightning strike protection minimizes damage to buildings during lightning terminations. This is usually accomplished by providing multiple interconnected pathways of low electrical impedance to the ground. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in residential lightning protections, however in industrial, chemically corrosive environments, the copper may need to be clad in tin.Copper lightning protection systems save lives, billions; Building and Architectural News, #80, Winter 1995; Copper effectively facilitates the transmission of lightning energy to the ground because of its excellent electrical conductivity. Also, it bends easily compared to other conductor materials. When copper roofing, gutters, and rain leaders are electrically bonded to an earth termination facility, a pathway of low electrical impedance to ground is provided, however without dedicated conduction pathways to concentrate the discharge channel, a disperse energized surface may not be the most desirable.Lightning protection; in Copper in Architecture Design Handbook; Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/lightning.html Because copper has a higher electrical conductivity than aluminium and its impedance during a lightning termination is less, copper allows for the use of less cross-sectional surface area per linear length, in its woven wires pathway than does aluminum. Also, aluminium cannot be used in poured concrete or for any component underground due to its galvanic properties.Lightning Protection Institute, FAQ: Is the aluminum and copper combination as durable and safe as the copper-only? And will it give us the same type and amount of protection? http://www.lightning.org/faq?page=11 To be effective, lightning protection systems generally maximize the surface area contact between the conductors and the earth through a ground grid of varying designs. To supplement grounding grids in low-conductivity earth, such as sand or rock, long, hollow copper tubes filled with metallic salts are available. These salts leach through holes in the tube, making the surrounding soil more conductive as well as increasing the overall surface area which decreases effective resistance. Copper roofs may be used as part of a lightning protection scheme where the copper skin, gutters and rainwater pipes can be linked and bonded to an earth termination facility. The thickness of copper specified for roofing materials is usually adequate for lightning protection.Design considerations: European Copper in Architecture Campaign; http://copperalliance.org.uk/docs/librariesprovider5/resources/pub-154-guide- to-copper-in-architecture-pdf.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn;=0 A dedicated lightning protection system may be recommended to adequate lightning protection with an installed copper roof system. The system would include air terminals and intercepting conductors on the roof, a system of ground electrodes, and a system of down-conductors connecting the roof and ground components. It is recommended that the copper roof be bonded to the system of conductors. Bonding ensures that the conductors and roof remain at equipotential and reduce side flashing and possible roof damage. ===Wide range of finishes=== It is sometimes desirable to chemically alter the surface of copper or copper alloys to create a different color. The most common colors produced are brown or statuary finishes for brass or bronze and green or patina finishes for copper.How to apply statuary and patina finishes, Application Data Sheet for Copper, Brass and Bronze, Copper Development Association Inc. Mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings are described elsewhere in this article at: Finishes. ===Design continuity=== Architects often look to architectural copper for continuity in design elements. For example, a copper roofing system may be designed with copper flashings, weatherings, vents, gutters, and downpipes. Cover details may include cornices, moldings, finials and sculptures. With the growing use of vertical cladding, vertical and roofing surfaces can run into each other so that complete continuity of material and performance is maintained. Rain screens and curtain walling (often linked with transoms and mullions) are also gaining popularity in modern architectural design.The guide to copper in architecture; European Copper in Architecture Campaign; http://www.copperconcept.org/sites/default/files/attachment/2011/pubpdf145.pdf ===Antimicrobial=== Extensive worldwide tests have proved that uncoated copper and copper alloys (e.g., brass, bronze, copper nickel, copper-nickel-zinc) have strong intrinsic antimicrobial properties with efficacies against a wide range of disease-resistant bacteria, molds, fungi and viruses.Copper touch surfaces, http://www.coppertouchsurfaces.org/program/index.html After years of testing, the U.S. approved the registration of over 300 different copper alloys (copper, brasses, bronzes, copper-nickels, and nickel-silvers) as antimicrobial materials. These developments are creating markets for antimicrobial copper and copper alloys in interior architecture. To meet the design needs for building surfaces, structures, fixtures, and components, antimicrobial copper-based products are available in a wide range of colors, finishes, and mechanical properties.Antimicrobial Copper, www.antimicrobialcopper.com Copper handrails, counter tops, hallways, doors, push plates, kitchens, and bathrooms are just some of the antimicrobial products approved for hospitals, airports, offices, schools, and army barracks to kill harmful bacteria. See: a list of products approved in the U.S. ===Sustainability=== While a universally accepted definition of sustainability remains elusive, the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability, the long-term maintenance of responsibility, requires the reconciliation of environmental, social equity and economic demands. These \\"three pillars\\" of sustainability encompass the responsible management of resource use. Also, it can mean that we can use a resource which won't cease to be abundant despite increasing intake. Copper is a sustainable material. Its durability offers long service with little maintenance. Its high electrical and thermal energy efficiencies reduce the waste of electrical energy. Its antimicrobial properties destroy pathogenic microorganisms that cause disease. And its high scrap value and ability to be continuously recycled without any loss in performance ensure its responsible management as a valuable resource. Life cycle inventory (LCI) information on copper tube, sheet, and wire products, using ISO standards and covering the mining and primary copper production sectors (i.e., smelting and refining) is available.Life Cycle Center, Deutsches Kupferinstitut, http://www.kupfer- institut.de/lifecycle/ (Life cycle analysis for copper products, Deutsches Kupferinstitut, http://www.kupfer-institut.de/lifecycle/media/pdf/LCI-1.pdf Used in life cycle assessments (LCAs), particularly in the building and construction sector, LCI datasets assist manufacturers of copper-containing products with compliance and voluntary improvement initiatives. They also support policy makers in the development of environmental guidelines and regulations with the aim of fostering sustainable development. The long lifetime of copper roofing and cladding has a significant positive effect on whole life assessments of copper versus other materials in terms of embodied energy consumption (i.e., the total energy consumed during every phase of each lifecycle in MJ/m2), CO2 generation, and cost. {  +Comparison of lifespan, embodied energy, and embodied CO2 emissions of copper, stainless steel, and aluminum in roofing and cladding materials.

Recyclability is a key factor of a sustainable material. It reduces the need to mine new resources and requires less energy than mining. Copper and its alloys are virtually 100% recyclable and can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality (i.e., copper does not degrade (i.e., downcycle) after each recycling loop as do most non-metallic materials, if they are recyclable at all). Copper retains much of its primary metal value: premium-grade scrap normally contains at least 95% of the value of primary metal from newly mined ore. Scrap values for competing materials range from about 60% down to 0%. And copper recycling requires only around 20% of the energy needed to extract and process primary metal. Currently, around 40% of Europe's annual copper demandVoutilainen, Pia and Schonenberger, John 2010. Is copper in architecture sustainable? Copper Forum: The Magazine of Copper in Architecture; 28/2010 and about 55% of copper used in architecture come from recycled sources. New copper coil and sheet often have 75%-100% recycled content. By 1985, more copper was recycled than the total amount of copper that was consumed in 1950. This is due to the relative ease of reusing processing waste and salvaging copper from products after their useful life. Six-sided copper cupola with copper finial and copper rooster weather vane mounted on top. ===Cost effectiveness=== Performance, maintenance, service life, and recovery costs from recycling are factors that determine the cost effectiveness of building components. While copper's initial cost is higher than some other architectural metals, it usually does not need to be replaced during the life of a building. Due to its durability, low maintenance, and ultimate salvage value, the additional cost for copper may be insignificant over the life of a roofing system.Sternthal, Daniel 2000. Copper flashings in contemporary construction; The Construction Specifier, Magazine of the Construction Specifications Institute, October 2000 Copper roofing is considerably less expensive than lead, slate, or hand-made clay tiles. Its costs are comparable with zinc, stainless steel, aluminum and even some clay and concrete tiles when considering overall roofing costs (including structure). Some studies indicate that copper is a more cost-effective material on a life cycle basis than other roof materials with a lifetime of 30 years or more.Goto, Shihoko 2012. Copper in architecture, Business Insider, as published in Resource Investing News, March 14, 2012; http://www.businessinsider.com/copper-in-architecture-2012-3Copper in Architecture Resource Investing News A European study comparing roofing costs of copper with other metals, concrete and clay tiles, slate, and bitumen found that in the medium to long-term (for lives of 60 to 80 years and 100 years and over), copper and stainless steel were the most cost effective roofing materials of all materials examined. Installation techniques such as prefabrication, in-situ machine forming, mechanized seaming, and the long- strip system help to reduce the installation costs of copper roofing. By lowering installation costs, these techniques permit designers to specify copper into a wider array of building types, not just large prestigious projects as had been common in the past. Since scrap copper retains much of its primary value, copper's life cycle costs are reduced when accounting for its salvage value. For more information, see Recyclability section in this article. ==Pure vs. alloyed copper== Pure copper. Unlike other metals, copper is frequently used in its pure (99.9% Cu) unalloyed form for sheet and strip applications in roofing, exterior cladding, and flashing. Tempering is a heat treatment technique used to increase the toughness of metals. Tempers determine the ductility of the metal, and therefore how well it forms and will hold its shape without additional support. In the U.S., copper is available in six tempers: 060 soft, hard cold rolled, cold rolled high yield, half hard, three quarter hard, and hard.Standard specification for copper sheet and strip for building construction, ASTM International, ASTM B370-03, http://www.astm.org/Standards/B370.htmStandard classification for temper designations for copper and copper alloys—wrought and cast, ASTM International, ASTM B601-09; http://www.astm.org/Standards/B601.htm In the U.K., only three designations exist: soft, half-hard, and hard. Copper and its alloys are defined in the U.S. in Standard Designations for Copper and Copper Alloys by ASTM; in Europe by BS EN 1172: 1997 - 'Copper and Copper Alloys in Europe'; and in the U.K. by the British Standard Code of Practice CP143: Part12: 1970. Cold rolled copper temper is by far the most popular in building construction in the U.S. It is less malleable than soft copper but is far stronger. Cold rolled hard tempered copper is often recommended for roofing and flashing installations. Roof sheets with higher tempers may be specified for certain applications.Types of Copper and Properties, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/intro.html Soft tempered copper is extremely malleable and offers far less resistance than cold rolled copper to the stresses induced by expansion and contraction. It is used for intricate ornamental work and where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated thru-wall flashing conditions. The major use for high-yield copper is in flashing products, where malleability and strength are both important. The thickness of sheet and strip copper is measured in the U.S. by its weight in ounces per square foot. Thicknesses commonly used in construction in the U.S. are between and . Since the industry often uses gauge numbers or actual thicknesses for sheet metal or other building materials, it is necessary to convert between the different measurement systems. In Europe, phosphorus de-oxidized non-arsenical copper is used with the designation C106. The copper is rolled to thicknesses ranging between ( for curtain walling) but a thickness is usually used for roofing. Alloyed copper. Copper alloys, such as brass and bronze, are also used in residential and commercial building structures. Variations in color stem primarily from differences in the alloy chemical composition. Some of the more popular copper alloys and their associated Unified Numbering System (UNS) numbers developed by ASTM and SAESAE International are as follows: Colors of copper and various copper alloys used in building structures. {  - !

Further information on architectural copper alloys is available.Copper brass bronze - Architectural Applications, published by the Copper Development Association, www.buildingconstruction@cda.copper.orgCopper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Alloys, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html ==Selection criteria== The criteria by which copper and copper alloys are selected for architectural projects include color, strength, hardness, resistance to fatigue and corrosion, electrical and thermal conductivity, and ease of fabrication.Types of copper and properties, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/intro.html Appropriate thicknesses and tempers for specific applications are essential; substitutions can lead to inadequate performance. Architectural copper is generally used in sheet and strip. Strip is or less in width, while sheet is over in width, up to in width by in length, plus in coil form. ==Structural considerations== Structural considerations play an important role in the proper design of copper applications. The primary concern is about thermal effects: movement and stresses related to temperature variations. Thermal effects can be accommodated by preventing movement and resisting cumulative stresses or by allowing movement at predetermined locations, thereby relieving anticipated thermal stresses.Structural considerations, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/structural_considerations.html Statue of Liberty has of copper sheeting.Welcome to the Statue of Liberty; Vigsnes Copper Museum; http://park.org/Guests/Stavanger/statue.htm New York City, U.S. Wind resistance is an important structural consideration. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) conducted a series of tests on copper roof systems. A copper standing-seam roof with test panels was subjected to the UL 580, Uplift Resistance Test Protocol. The copper system did not exhibit unusual deformation, the cleats did not loosen from the structural deck, and the system passed UL 580 requirements. UL-90 designation was granted.Sternthal, Daniel (2002). Long-pan expansion, wind uplift, and line corrosion; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003Sternthal, Daniel (1998). A primer on copper roofing, The Construction Specifier, Magazine of the Construction Specifications Institute, September 1998 ==Joining== Copper and its alloys are readily joined by mechanical techniques, such as crimping, staking, riveting, and bolting; or by bonding techniques, such as soldering, brazing and welding. Selection of the best joining technique is determined by service requirements, joint configuration, thickness of components, and alloy composition. Soldering is the preferred joining method where strong, watertight joints are required, such as for internal gutters, roofing, and flashing applications. A soldered seam joins two pieces of copper into a cohesive unit that expands and contracts as one piece. Well-soldered seams are often stronger than the original base material and provide many years of service. Mechanical fasteners, such as screws, bolts, and rivets, are often used to strengthen the joints and seams. Continuous, long runs of soldered seams can cause stress fractures and should therefore be avoided.Architectural considerations, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/arch_considerations.html Common 50-50 tin-lead bar solder is often used for uncoated copper; 60-40 tin- lead solder is used for lead-coated copper.Sternthal, Daniel (2000). Copper flashings in contemporary construction, The Construction Specifier, Magazine of the Construction Specifications Institute, October 2000 Many lead-free solders are also acceptable. Adhesives can be used in certain applications. Relatively thin sheet alloys can be bonded to plywood or certain types of foam which act as rigid insulation. Brazing is the preferred method for joining pipe and tube copper alloys. Copper metal sections are joined with a non- ferrous filler material with a melting point above 800 degrees Fahrenheit but below the melting point of the base metals. Blind or concealed joints are recommended since the color match of silver filler material is fair to poor. Welding is a process where pieces of copper are effectively melted together, either by flame, electricity, or high pressure. With increasing availability of modern TIG welding equipment, welding of even light-gauge copper decorative elements is gaining acceptance. Instructional videos are available regarding fluxing and soldering techniques; how to make flat seam solder joints, double- lock standing seams, lap seams, soldering vertical sheet copper lap seams, and stitches (including the butterfly stitch); as well as copper tinning, bending, flaring, and brazing.DIY: Do it proper with copper video series, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/doityourself/homepage.html ==Sealants== Sealants are an alternative to solder where additional strength is not required. In most cases, sealants should not be necessary with a properly designed copper installation. They are at best a relatively short-term solution requiring frequent maintenance. Regardless, sealant-filled joints have been used successfully as a secondary waterproofing measure for standing seam and batten seam roofing applications where low-sloped roofs are less than . Sealants can also be used in joints that are primarily designed to accommodate thermal movement of the copper. The sealants used should be tested by the manufacturer and designated as compatible for use with copper. In general, butyl, polysulfide, polyurethane, and other inorganic or rubber-based sealants are reasonably compatible with copper. Acrylic, neoprene, and nitrile-based sealants actively corrode copper. Silicone sealants are somewhat successful with copper but their suitability should be verified before application. ==Galvanic corrosion== Copper roof at the Minneapolis City Hall. Galvanic corrosion is an electrochemical process whereby one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact with each other in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals is the driving force for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.Sternthal, Daniel 2000. Copper flashings in contemporary construction, The Construction Specifier, October 2000Flashings and copings, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/intro.html Metals are ranked according to galvanic numbers as a qualitative measure of their nobility. These numbers qualify the resistance to corrosion of any metal when in contact with other metals. A larger difference in the galvanic number between two metals in contact with each other indicates a greater potential for corrosion. The galvanic numbers of the most common metals used in construction are ranked as follows:Commercially Pure Copper Galvanic Corrision Information; http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/copper-contact-corrosion.htm 1\\\\. aluminum; 2. zinc; 3. steel; 4. iron; 5. stainless steel - active; 6. tin; 7. lead; 8. copper; 9. stainless steel - passive. Galvanic corrosion is a primary concern with metal roof maintenance. Marine environments present an additional concern due to the higher concentration of salts in the air and water.Metal roofing basics: corrosion, strength and thermal movement are important issues to consider in specifying metal roofs; The Canadian Architect, Vol. 40, Issue 2 (Feb 1995), pp. 31-37). Copper is one of the most noble metals. It will not be harmed by contact with other metals but it will cause corrosion to some other metals if contacted directly. The principal metals of concern regarding direct contact with copper are aluminum, light- gauge steel, and zinc. Aluminum and steel flashings and galvanized steel fasteners should not be used with copper. Runoff from a copper roof corrodes aluminum and steel guttering.Metal roofing basics: corrosion, strength and thermal movement are important issues to consider in specifying metal roofs; The Canadian Architect, Vol. 40, Issue 2 (Feb 1995), pp. 31-37)Craftsman's dream, Roofer's challenge; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003 It is not necessary to isolate copper from lead, tin or many stainless steels under most circumstances.Architectural Considerations, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/arch_considerations.html When it is not possible to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or zinc chromate primers can be used between copper and aluminum. Bituminous, zinc chromate, or a red lead primer can be effective in separating copper from iron and other ferrous metals. Taping or gasketing with non-absorptive materials or sealants are effective in separating copper from all other metals. In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar gasketing materials should be used, except between copper and aluminum. Water draining from copper surfaces should be prevented from exposure to aluminum and galvanized steel as traces of copper salts may accelerate corrosion. In some cases, anodizing may protect thicker aluminum, such as aluminum window system mullions. ==Natural patinas== Copper goes through a natural oxidation process that forms a unique protective patina on the metal. The surface of the metal undergoes a series of color changes: from iridescent/salmon pinks to oranges and reds interspersed with brassy yellows, blues, greens and purples. As the oxide thickens, these colors are replaced by russet and chocolate browns, dull slate grays or blacks, and finally to a light-green or blue-green. Copper's patination process is complex. It starts immediately on exposure to the environment with the initial formation of copper oxide conversion films that are noticeable within six months. Weathering may be uneven at first but the film becomes even after about nine months. Within the first few years, cuprous and cupric sulfide conversion films darken the surface to browns and then dull slate gray or dull black. Continued weathering transforms the sulfide films to sulfates, which are the notable blue-green or gray-green patinas. Copper roofs in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The rate of patination conversion is dependent upon copper's exposure to moisture, salt, and acidity from acid-forming pollutants. In marine climates, the entire patination process can take seven to nine years. In industrial environments, patina formation reaches its final stage in about fifteen to twenty-five years. In clean rural atmospheres with low concentrations of airborne sulfur dioxide, the final stage may take ten to thirty years to develop.Finishes – natural weathering, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., In arid environments, a patina may not form at all if the moisture is insufficient. Where patination does take place in arid environments, it may mature to an ebony or nut brown. In all environments except the coastal areas, patination takes longer for vertical surfaces due to more rapid water runoff. The copper patinas are very thin: just in thickness. Yet, they are highly adherent to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between per year. For a sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion over a period of 100 years.Wallinder, Inger Odnevall; (2011). Copper architecture and the environment, Copper Architecture Forum; 31/2011; http://www.copperconcept.org/sites/default/files/copper- forum/31/copper-forum-2011-31-en.pdf Further information is available on copper patination.Finishes – natural weathering, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook ==Finishes== Copper and its alloys can be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings. These are described here. Mechanical surface treatments. Several types of mechanical surface treatments exist. Mill finishes are derived by normal production processes, such as rolling, extrusion, or casting. \\"Buffeted\\" finishes impart bright mirror-like appearances after grinding, polishing, and buffing. \\"Directional textured\\" finishes provide a smooth, velvety satin sheen in a continuous pattern of fine nearly parallel scratches. \\"Non-directional textured matte\\" finishes achieve a rough texture, primarily on castings, as spray sand or metal shot are applied under high pressure. And \\"patterned\\" finishes, made by pressing a copper alloy sheet between two rolls, produce a textured and embossed look. Chemically induced patina. Architects sometimes request a particular patina color at installation. Factory-applied chemically induced pre-patination systems can produce a wide range of colored finishes similar to natural patination. Pre- patinated copper is particularly useful in repairs when there is need to provide close color matches to old copper roofs.Pinkham, Myra (1997). The new copper story: Green; Metal Center News, 37. Â4;March; pgs. 40-47 Pre- patination is also considered in some modern building materials, such as vertical cladding, soffits, and gutters where patination is desired but would not ordinarily occur. Chemical coloring of metals is an art involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful.Finishes – Chemical weathering, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/finishes/finishes.html#chmwthrng Copper Brass Bronze Design Handbook: Architectural Applications, Copper Development Association, 1994 Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process. Because of the number of variables involved, chemically induced patinas are prone to problems such as a lack of adhesion, excessive staining of adjacent materials, and inability to achieve reasonable color uniformity over large surface areas. Chemical patination applied in the field is not recommended due to variations in temperature, humidity, and chemical requirements. Warranties are prudent when purchasing pre-patinated copper for architectural projects. Useful techniques and recipes for coloring copper, brass, yellow-brass, bronze, cast bronze, gilding metal, along with various physical and chemical textural finishes are available.Hughes, Richard and Rowe, Michael, (1982, 1991), The Coloring, Bronzing, and Patination of Metals; published by The Crafts Council (London, UK), Coatings. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth and metallic tone of copper alloys. However, particularly on exterior applications, they introduce maintenance into what is naturally a maintenance-free material. They are organic chemicals that are dry at ambient temperatures or require heat for curing or solvent evaporation. Examples of clear organic coatings include alkyd, acrylic, cellulose acetate butyrate, epoxy, nitrocellulose, silicone, and urethane. Further details are available.Clear coatings on copper alloys – Technical Report; Copper Application Data, A4027; Copper Development AssociationClear organic finishes for copper and copper alloys; Application Data Sheet 161/0; Copper Development Association Inc. Oils and waxes exclude moisture from copper surfaces and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster and depth of color. Oiling is typically used to prolong the time exposed copper remains in a brown to black tone. It will not keep copper shiny on an exterior installation. Oils and waxes offer short-term protection for exterior applications and longer-term protection for interior applications.Sternthal, Daniel (1998). A primer on copper roofing, The Construction Specifier, Magazine of the Construction Specifications Institute, September Oiling predominates for roofing and flashing work. The most popular oils are Lemon Oil, U.S.P., Lemon Grass Oil, Native E.I., paraffin oils, linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication as infrequently as once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended to from three to five years. Waxing is generally reserved for architectural components subject to close inspection and/or traffic. Mixes considered satisfactory include Carnauba wax and wood turpentine, or beeswax and wood turpentine, or paste waxes. Opaque paint coatings are used primarily for work applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required.Finishes – Coatings, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/finishes/finishes.html#ctngs Zinc-tin coatings are an alternative to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and workability.The glory of copper; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003Sternthal, Daniel 2000.

Craftsmen and designers utilize copper's inherent benefits to build aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting building systems. From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper is used in many products: low-sloped and pitched roofs, soffits, fascias, flashings, gutters, downspouts, building expansion joints, domes, spires, and vaults. Copper is also used to clad walls and other surfaces in the exterior and interior environment.Architectural details, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/details_intro.html ===Roofing=== Copper offers a unique character and durability as a roofing material. Its appearance can complement any style of building, from traditional to modern. Its warmth and beauty make it a desirable material for many architects. Copper also satisfies demands of architects and building owners regarding lifetime cost, ease of fabrication, low maintenance, and environmental friendliness. New copper roof installation. The installation of copper roofing is a craft requiring experienced installers. Its ductility and malleability make it a compatible material to form over irregular roof structures. It is easy to hammer or work into watertight designs without caulk or gaskets.Craftsman's dream, Roofer's challenge; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003 Domes and other curved roof shapes are readily handled with copper. When properly designed and installed, a copper roof provides an economical, long-term roofing solution. Tests on European copper roofs from the 18th century showed that, in theory, copper roofs can last one thousand years. New copper roof of Shinto outdoor altar. Another advantage of copper roofing systems is that they are relatively easy to repair. For small pits or cracks, affected areas can be cleaned and filled with solder. For larger areas, patches can be cut and soldered into place. For major areas, the affected copper can be cut out and replaced using a flat locked soldered seam. Copper roofs can be designed to meet or surpass other materials in terms of energy savings. A vented copper roof assembly at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (U.S.) substantially reduced heat gain versus stone-coated steel shingle (SR246E90) or asphalt shingle (SR093E89), resulting in lower energy costs.Copper roofs are cool, Architecture: Working with Copper, Copper Development Association, 2009; http://www.copper.org/publications/pub_list/pdf/a4094.pdf Types of copper roofs include:Roofing systems, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/roofing/intro.html Standing seam roofing is composed of preformed or field-formed pans. The pans run parallel to the slope of the roof and are joined to adjacent pans with double-locked standing seams. Copper cleats locked into these seams secure the roofing to the deck. Batten seam roofing consists of copper pans running parallel to the roof slope, separated by wood battens. Battens are covered with copper caps that are loose-locked into adjacent pans to help to secure the roofing. Cleats attached to the battens secure the roofing pans. Transverse seams are required to join ends of preformed pans. Horizontal seam roofs, also called the Bermuda style, consist of copper pans where the long dimension runs horizontally across a roof, attached to horizontal wood nailers. A step is used at each nailer to allow adjacent pans to lock effectively. The height and spacing of the steps enable different appearances. A common design for a chevron roof is based on a batten seam construction to which auxiliary battens are attached. With proper design, decorative battens can have almost any shape or size and run in any direction. Flat locked and soldered seam roofing systems are typically used on flat or low-pitched roofs. They are also used on curved surfaces such as domes and barrel vaults. Flat seam unsoldered copper roofing is a shingle-like option for high slope applications. Mansard roofs are used on vertical or nearly vertical surfaces. For the most part, these roofs are based on standing seam or batten seam construction. Long-pan systems (pans and seam lengths greater than ) accommodate the cumulative expansion stress over long spans of copper sheets. These installations can be complicated due to the length of roof pan versus seam length, cleat design and spacing, and the physical expansion characteristics of copper sheets. This expansion must be accommodated by fixing the pan at one end (which accumulates the expansion at the loose end) or by fixing the center of the pan (which accumulates half of the expansion at both free ends).Long-pan expansion, wind uplift, and line corrosion; Metal Roofing Magazine, December 2002/January 2003 In addition to panels, copper roof tiles can add uniqueness to a roofing system. They can be used on any roof shape and in all types of climates.Complement existing and new projects with metal roof tiles; Infolink: Australia's architecture, building, construction and design directory; http://www.infolink.com.au/c/Copper-Roof- Shingles/Compliment-Existing-and-New-Projects-with-Metal-Roof-Tiles-from- Copper-Roof-Shingles-p20516 ===Flashing=== While most modern construction materials are fairly resistant to moisture penetration, many joints between masonry units, panels, and architectural features are not. The effects of natural movement due to settlement, expansion, and contraction may eventually lead to leaks. Copper is an excellent material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, solderability, workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life. This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper's long life is a major cost advantage. Cold rolled hard temper copper is recommended for most flashing applications. This material offers more resistance than soft copper to the stresses of expansion and contraction. Soft copper can be specified where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated roof shapes. Thermal movement in flashings is prevented or is permitted only at predetermined locations. Flashing installed incorrectly can promote line corrosion and shorten the life of valley flashing, especially in acidic environments. The risk is most prevalent at the leading edge of shingles where the shingle edges rest on the copper flashing. Through-wall flashing diverts moisture that has entered the wall before it can cause damage. Counterflashing diverts water to the base flashing, which, in turn, diverts it to other materials. Various types of copper flashings and copings exist. Diagramatic explanations are available.Flashings and copings: Coping covers; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/coping_covers.htmlFlashings and coatings: Counterflashing; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/counterflashing.htmlFlashings and copings: Stepped and chimney flashings; http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/flashings_copings/chimney.html ===Gutters and downspouts=== Copper gutter system showing half round copper gutters, radius copper guttering, copper leader head, round copper downspout pipe, decorative copper gutter hangers. Leaking gutters and downspouts can cause serious damage to a building's interior and exterior. Copper is a good choice for gutters and downspouts because it makes strong leak-proof joints. Gutters and downspouts made with copper are expected to outlast other metal materials and plastics. Even in corrosion-prone seacoast environments or in areas with acid rain or smog, copper gutters and downspouts can provide 50 years or more of service.Textor, Ken (2000). Gutters and downspouts; Country Journal; Vol. 27, No. 2; March/April 2000Gutters and downspouts, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/gutters_downspouts/homepage.html Downspouts can be plain or corrugated, round or rectangular. cold rolled copper is typically used. Decorative designs are also available. Gargoyle rain spout roof scupper combination fashioned from pure copper. Hung copper gutters are supported by brass- or copper brackets or hangers, or by brass straps. Copper gutter linings are often built into wood framed supporting structures. Scuppers are used to provide an outlet through parapet walls or gravel stops on flat and built-up roofs to allow drainage of excess water. They can be used in conjunction with gutters and downspouts to divert water flow to the desired location. Copper roof sumps are generally used for draining small roof areas such as canopies. Roof sump drains are not recommended for general roof drainage systems. Custom-made copper leader head. One of the disadvantages of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper can result in a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper. ===Domes, spires and vaults=== Copper dome made with standing seam copper panels and with a copper finial pineapple mounted on top. The copper finial is handmade from uncoated copper and the pineapple leaves are patinated copper. Copper belfry of St. Laurentius church, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler There are many types of copper domes, spires, and vaults, both with simple geometries or complex curved surfaces and multi- faceted designs.Domes, spires, and vaults, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/domes_spires_vaults/intro.html Examples include circular domes with diagonal flat seam systems, circular domes with standing seam systems, circular domes with flat seam systems, conical spires, flat seam roofing on octagonal spires, standing seam barrel vaults, and flat seam barrel vaults.

Copper-clad spire at the Saïd Business School, Oxford, U.K., is a modern interpretation of \\"Dreaming Spires.\\" ===Wall cladding=== Copper cladding has become popular in modern architecture. The technology enables architects to incorporate visually desirable features into their designs, such as embossed or shaped-metal cladding. Cladding enables structures to be made with much less weight than solid copper. composites weigh , only 35% as much as solid copper of the same thickness.Lightweight copper cladding, Copper Topics, Number 95, Copper Development Association Inc. Copper cladding is used in building exteriors and indoor environments. On building exteriors, copper cladding sheets, shingles, and pre-fabricated panels shield buildings from the elements, acting as first line of defenses against wind, dust, and water. The cladding is lightweight, durable, and corrosion resistant, which is particularly important for large buildings.Wise Geek: What is copper cladding?; http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-copper-cladding.htm Common interior applications include lobby walls, soffits, column facings, and interior walls of elevator cabs. Copper cladding can be cut, routed, sawed, filed, drilled, screwed, welded, and curved to form complex shapes. A variety of finishes and colors are available. Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can be covered with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from sheet material. They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, engineered systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels are designed to be attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat lock panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat lock panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather.Wall cladding, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/wall_cladding/intro.html Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet. The former British Overseas Aircraft Corporation headquarters building in Glasgow is clad with copper. Peckham Library, in London, won the 2000 Stirling Award for Architectural Innovation, the 2001 Copper Cladding Award, and the 2002 Civic Trust Award for excellence in public architecture. Several different copper facade cladding systems are available: Seaming technique. This is a vertical or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and façade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness may not be a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. Double lock standing seams are often not necessary.

System shingles. Shingles are pre-manufactured rectangular or square flat tiles for roofs, walls, and individual building components. They have 1800 folds along all four borders – two folds towards the external side and two towards the internal side. The shingles are interlocked during installation. The fastening is hidden with stainless steel or copper clips on wood sheeting or trapezoidal panels. Machine notching and folding ensures that the shingles have uniform dimensions.

Panels. Panels are sheets of pre-profiled copper with lengths up to and standard widths up to . They are two-sided cladding elements that can be with or without an end base. Assembly is performed using the tongue and groove principle or by overlapping. Panels can be assembled vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There are three basic forms: tongue and groove panels laid vertically as level surface facade cladding; tongue and groove panels laid horizontally as level surface facade cladding; and custom panels laid in different directions with visible or masked fastening, flush against the surface or overlapping.

System cassettes. This is a rigid rectangular ventilated wall system consisting of curved or flat metal panels mounted and secured to a supporting structure. All four borders are pre-folded at the factory. Folded edges on every side allow large sheet metal parts to lie even with the cladding surface. Fixing is usually by riveting, screwing, or by using angle brackets or bolt hooks to fix the cassettes directly to the substrate. System cassettes are pre-profiled to meet specific architectural requirements. Links to representative photographs of cassette cladding are available.TYS-Ikituuri student apartments, in Turku, Finland.

Profiled sheets are well suited for covering large cladding surfaces without joints because of their regular, unimposing profiles. Available in a wide variety of shapes, they are well- suited for new flat roofs, façade and pitched roofs, and renovation work. Profiles available include: sinusoidal wave corrugated profiles; trapezoidal profiles with various geometries; and custom profiles with special geometry and edges. They can be pre-manufactured and specified with embossed patterns or other designs. Special shapes. Special shaped façades are available to impart desired visual effects. Perforated metal sheets are available with a variety of shapes (round, square, oblong, etc.) and arrangements (rectangular, diagonal, parallel width, staggered, etc.). They can be designed to create subtle patterns, 'super graphics,' and text. Mesh and textile structures are also available.

Building expansion joints provide barriers to the exterior and cover spaces between components. Copper is an excellent material for expansion joints because it is easy to form and lasts a long time. Details regarding roof conditions, roof edges, floors, are available.Building expansion joints, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/building_expansion/intro.html ===Indoor design=== Architectural copper cladding in the interior of the Capital Museum, Beijing, People's Republic of China. Copper aesthetically enhances interior wall systems, ceilings, fixtures, furniture, and hardware by evoking an atmosphere of warmth, tranquility, and calm. Regarding performance advantages, it is lightweight, fire resistant, durable, workable, and non- organic (it does not off-gas). Typical copper-based interiors include panels, shingles, screens, ornaments, fixtures, and other decorative enhancements. Cathedral-Basilica Mary Queen of the World, in Montreal. At the transept crossing in front of the main altar stands the Baldacchino with red copper, made in Rome in 1900. Since copper surfaces kill pathogenic microbes, architects who design public facilities, such as hospitals and mass transit facilities, look to copper products as a public health benefit. In recent years, copper countertops, range hoods, sinks, handles, doorknobs, faucets, and furniture embellishments have become trendy – both for their appearance as well as for their antimicrobial properties. (See main article: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces). Copper is joined in indoor environments by butt welding, soldering, rivets, nails, screws, bolting, standing seams, lap seams (with and without fasteners), flat seams, bolted flanges, splines, flush laps, and batten seams. ===Green buildings=== Sustainable materials are key elements of green buildings. Some benefits of sustainable materials include durability, long life, recyclability, and energy and thermal efficiency. Copper ranks highly in all of these categories. Copper is one of nature's most efficient thermal and electrical conductors, which helps to conserve energy. Because of its high thermal conductivity, it is used extensively in building heating systems, direct exchange heat pumps, and solar power and hot water equipment. Its high electrical conductivity increases the efficiency of lighting, electrical motors, fans, and appliances, making a building's operation more cost effective with less energy and environmental impact.Copper: Architecture's green 'enabler' (2007). Building & Architecture News, Vol. 66 No. 3, A408 xx/07, Copper Development Association Inc. Because copper has a better thermal conductivity rating than usual façade and roofing materials, it is well-suited to solar thermal façade systems. The first commercial application of a fully integrated solar thermal copper façade system was installed at the Pori Public Swimming Complex in Finland. The installation is an urban example of sustainability and carbon emissions reduction. The solar façade works in conjunction with roof collectors and is supplemented by roof- mounted photovoltaics that provide 120,000 kWh of heat, an amount of energy equivalent to that used annually by six average family houses in cold-climate Finland.Copper Architecture Forum, 31/2011; http://www.copperconcept.org/sites/default/files/copper-forum/31/copper- forum-2011-31-en.pdf One standard in the United States Green Building Council (USGBC)'s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system (LEED) requires that newly constructed buildings include materials containing pre- and post-consumer recycled content. Most copper products used in construction (except electrical materials that require highly refined virgin copper) contain a large percentage of recycled content.

The Macropodia Rostrata visually mimics many other types of small crabs with the exception of its long legs. By attaching algae to their thin legs, they can be confused with the stem of seaweed. This is both a defense mechanism and a predatory advantage, as unsuspecting fish will hide in seaweed beds from nearby predators. This behavior can be absent among larger crabs, and those that live at great depths like giant Japanese spider crabs. ==Description== Macropodia rostrata has a hairy, or fuzzy appearance due to algae it applies to itself for camouflage. Both the carapace and pereiopods of this species are greyish to yellowish or reddish-brown in colour, with some specimens showing white markings. The carapace grows to a maxiximum length of 16 (28) mm, with the anterior part is narrowing, giving it a pear shape.The length of the carapace is measuredon the median line, from the anterior to the posterior margin. The surface of the carapace surface contains numerous hook-setae. From a dorsal view, the eye-stalks are completely visible. Macropodia rostrata use their eyes as well as other sensory organs to locate and catch prey. Spider crabs are omnivorous and most are underwater scavengers, and will eat anything from algae to mollusks and small fish. Decorator crabs such as the Macropodia rostrata will use the algae covering their limbs as camouflage and an emergency food source. ==Distribution and ecology== Macropodia rostrata is found along the coasts of Europe and western Africa, from 65° N in Norway to South Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. Unlike giant Japanese Spider crabs, you will not find Macropodia Rostrata on the bottom of the ocean. It occurs chiefly at depths of , although it can occasionally be found at up to . It is commonly found in muddy sand, and on kelp. Macropodia rostrata can apply algae to its body to camouflage itself. It is easily preyed upon as it is slow moving. When startled, spider crabs will waive their pincers over their heads, which is their main defense against predators such as gulls and shorebirds. Although not common, large fish and sharks will prey on spider crabs, but are often dissuaded due to their hard shells. == Reproduction == Although it cannot be genetically determined what dictates minimum and maximum post-puberty sizes of Macropodia Rostrata, scientists believe it is the result of varied ecological histories. Interestingly, it was expected that the males of the species Macropodia Rostrata would show modification of the gential papillae and the first intromittent organs coinciding with the molt of puberty, however it was observed that the size of carapace length and gential papillae did not correlate. For male Macropodia Rostrata, the largest pre puberty carapace lengths are 18mm, while the mean is generally 16.4mm. Male macropodia Rostrata can reach a maximum post-puberty carapace length of 23mm. Females of the same species are generally smaller, and reach a maximum post puberty carapace length of 20mm. The largest pre-puberty length a female can reach is about 14 mm, while the average length after puberty is 14.4mm. As macropodia mature sexually, several interesting physiological changes occur. In males sexual maturity is indicated by the swelling and color change of their sperm ducts. This is caused by the production of sperm that is enclosed within spermatophores and gives the ducts a white appearance. In females of the species, change in shape and diameter of ovaries dicattes sexual maturity. For both males and females of the species, the “moult of puberty” is required to reproduce, as females do not ovulate before then and males do not produce sperm. Macropodia Rostrata can then copulate at any time after the “moult of puberty”. After copulation, sperm are stored in a spermathecae and the females can use this for several ovulations. Macropodia Rostrata produce eggs around the size of 0.6mm, and several factors influence how many they can produce. Macropodia Rostrata are continuous breeders, and do not have mating seasons. ==Taxonomy== M. rostrata was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1761 work ', under the name Cancer rostratus. ==References* * Category:Majoidea Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1761 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Macropodia rostrata"},{"id":"35850331","text":"Porculus is a genus of beetles in the family Ciidae, containing the following species:Ciidae Species List at Joel Hallan’s Biology Catalog.

He was subsequently a politician in North Korea, holding posts connected to the Workers' Party of Korea. Born in 1898 at Ulsan, in 1920 he moved to Japan and studied mathematics at Nihon University in Tokyo. While there, he organized a Korean workers' movement and was elected chairman of the Federal Union of Zainichi Koreans. Detained as a political prisoner, he was released on 10 October 1945 after Japan's defeat in the Second World War, and became a member of the executive committee of the JCP. Although the League of Koreans was founded as a non-political organization, his appointment as supreme adviser ensured its drift toward the left. Under Kim's influence, the League purged its anti- communist members and in February 1946 it joined the Korean Democratic National Front.Chapman, p. 27. In 1951, Edward Wagner described Kim as \\"the man who probably is to be credited more than any other with shaping the League's political orientation and preserving its undeviating character\\". He subsequently moved to North Korea in 1950 and became a member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,Kim, p. 79. and from April 1956 he served as chairman of the Fatherland Front. He remained in the Front's presidium through the first half of the 1960s.Lee & Scalapino, p. 519.

He also served as Vogt of the bishoprics of Trent and Brixen. == Life == He was the son of Count Henry I (d. 14 June 1190) and Agnes of Wangen, daughter of Count Adalbero I. He was still a minor when his father died in 1190, and only began to rule independently in 1202. He inherited the office of a Vogt of Trent from his father; in 1210, Bishop Conrad also appointed him Vogt of Brixen. When in 1209 the Counts of Andechs-Merania were banned for their alleged role in the murder of the Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia at the wedding of Duke Otto I of Merania in Bamberg, Albert took over their sovereign rights in the Inn, Wipp, Eisack, and Gader valleys. Shaping the independent County of Tyrol, he consolidated his position by quickly recognizing the now undisputed supremacy of Philip's rival, the Welf emperor Otto IV. After Emperor Otto's death in 1218, he again switched sides and became a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen ruler Frederick II. In 1217 he and Bishop Bertold of Brixen joined the Fifth Crusade. Albert had no sons, so he made sure his daughters would be allowed to inherit. In 1234 he married his daughter Elisabeth (d. 1256) off to the Andechs duke Otto II of Merania and his other daughter, Adelaide (d. 1279), to Count Meinhard of Gorizia, concluding mutual contracts of inheritance with both his sons-in-law. As a result, Albert acquired the Tyrolean possessions held by Otto II of Merania upon his death in 1248 and could also seize the lands of the extinct counts of Eppan in the same year. In the fierce controversy after the deposition of Emperor Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV in 1245, Albert remained a protagonist of the imperial party and took the occasion to invade the ecclesiastical territories of Bishop-elect Philip of Salzburg. In 1252, however, Albert and his son-in-law Meinhard were taken prisoner at Greifenburg by the united forces of Philip and his father Duke Bernard of Carinthia. Held in custody in Friesach, they were not released until December, after they ceded important possessions in Upper Carinthia, paid a large ransom and put up Meinhard's two sons as hostages. Albert IV died the next year and was buried in Stams. His inheritance was at first divided between his sons-in-law Meinhard and Count Gebhard IV of Hischberg, the second husband of his daughter Elisabeth. Gebhard had no children, so after his death, Meinhard's son Meinhard II re-united Albert's possessions. During his lifetime, Albert had tried to unite his possessions in the Tyrol area into a single county. In 1254, this entity was called the or . == Marriage and issue == Around 1211 Albert married Uta (d. 1254),daughter of the Bavarian count Henry II of Frontenhausen-Lechsgemünd (d. 1208).

She further explains that Plupp is neither male nor female, as she wanted to create a character that children of both sexes could identify with. Plupp also has the ability to talk with animals; two of their closest friends are the lemming Lämmel and the stoat Hermelin. The books about Plupp have been translated into Danish, Inari Sami, Northern Sami, Skolt Sami, English, Esperanto, Finnish, French, Faroese, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Norwegian, and German.

Some of the names became politically incompatible with the policies of the Convention nationale and were therefore renamed in 1794; some of the new names became in turn politically unacceptable after the Thermidorian Reaction, yielding new renamings in 1795. The success of the operation encouraged the French state to renew it on several dire occasions: from 1782 to 1790, and later again under the Revolution and the Empire. == Background == By the end of the Seven Years' War, the French Navy had sustained heavy casualties and lost thirty-two ships of the line: fifteen in isolated incidents, five during the Siege of Louisbourg, five during the Battle of Lagos and seven at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. As the State was already in debts, it was impossible to fund the reconstruction of the Navy by conventional means. Choiseul, secretary of State to the Navy, thus devised a scheme to have shipbuilding patronned by the French society directly. In 1762, Choiseul suggested to Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon, then Archbishop of Narbonne who presided the Estates of Languedoc, to incite the delegates of Languedoc to fund a 74-gun ship to the Crown, in the hope that this would set and example and encourage emulation in other provinces. == Fundraising == Allegorical engraving of the Don des vaisseaux, circa 1762, with an incomplete list of the ships built under the programme (with approximative armament). On 26 Novembre 1761, the archbishop gave a speech before the Estates of Langdoc, to the effect that they should Langdoc obliged, and the example was followed the next year by the Estates of the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy, Artois, Flanders; the cities of Paris, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Marseille; some particular institutions such as the Posts, the Six Corps (corporations of the merchants of Paris), the Ferme générale, the Chambers of commerce; and even individuals. == Ships built through donations == Of the 30 ships of the line built between 1760 and 1769, 18 were funded through donations totalling 13 million pounds. It is notably the case of the two three-deckers used during the Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War, Ville de Paris and Bretagne. {  width=100% -valign=\\"top\\" !colspan=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"white\\"Ships funded through fundraising - valign=\\"top\\" ! width=15%; align= center  Ship ! width=5%; align= center  Guns ! width=35%; align= center  Patron ! width=35%; align= center  Notes - valign=\\"top\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Six Corps  align= center  74  align= left  the six Corps of the merchants of Paris  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Provence  align= center  64  align= left  Estates of Provence  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Union  align= center  64  align= left  Individuals  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Diligent  align= center  74  align= left  Head of Posts  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Bordelois  align= center  56  align= left  City of Bordeaux  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Ferme  align= center  56  align= left  Ferme générale  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Ferme  align= center  74  align= left  Ferme générale  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Utile  align= center  56  align= left  Ferme générale  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Flamand  align= center  56  align= left  Estates of Flanders  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Citoyen  align= center  74  align= left  Treasurers of the Extraordinaire des Guerres  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Zélé  align= center  74  align= left  General Director of Finance  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Ville de Paris  align= center  90  align= left  City of Paris  align= left  Later upgraded to 104 guns - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Saint-Esprit  align= center  80  align= left  Order of the Holy Spirit  align= left  Renamed Scipion in 1794 - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Artésien  align= center  64  align= left  Estates of Artois  align= left  - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Languedoc  align= center  80  align= left  Estates of Languedoc  align= left  Renamed Antifédéraliste in 1794 and Victoire in 1795; she was the flagship at the Battle of Grenada in 1779. - valign=\\"top\\"  align= left  Bretagne  align= center  110  align= left  Estates of Brittany  align= left  Renamed Révolutionnaire in 1793.

He began playing at local coffeehouses and was dubbed a \\"folk singing wunderkind\\" by The Baltimore Sun. He later moved to Atlanta, where he formed the duo The Brilliant Inventions. The band became a staple of the Atlanta music scene, winning several local and national music awards and gaining a substantial fan following. In 2010, the band split up and Bronson continued solo, releasing Blackbirds in 2011. In 2012, Bronson released Milwaukee, with his band Yonder Orphans (Kevin Leahy, Will Robertson and Bret Hartley). == Career (2014–present) == In 2014, Bronson signed with independent music label, Saturn 5 Records. The ten-song self- titled album Eliot Bronson was recorded totally analog in Nashville by producer Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell). Going for feel and vibe over modern perfection, he used a rare Helios mixing console and a tape machine on loan from the Norman Petty Estate, which was also used to record Buddy Holly in the 1950s. Eliot Bronson was recorded in one week at Cobb's home studio and The Sound Emporium, and mixed the following week. Other musicians on the album include Bret Hartley, Chris Powell, Adam Gardner, Kristen Rogers and Dave Cobb. The album received critical acclaim and numerous \\"Top Album\\" ranking in the United States and Europe. Bronson was dubbed by Bop n Jazz as \\"maybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan\\". Bronson signed to Nashville-based Rock Ridge Music in a joint deal with Atlanta-based Hubbub! Music in May 2017. In August 2017, he released his next album James also produced by Nashville-based producer Dave Cobb. The album includes Rough Ride, a song about fellow Baltimorean Freddie Gray. The track Mercy was featured on episode 13.13 on the television show Criminal Minds. ==Discography== *Blackbirds (2011) *Milwaukee (2012) *Eliot Bronson (2014) *James (2017) ==Awards== *2005 Winner Eddie's Attic Shootout (The Brilliant Inventions) *2008 Best Local Musical Act from Creative Loafing (The Brilliant Inventions) *2009 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival Emerging Artist Award (The Brilliant Inventions) *2011 New Folk Finalist at the Kerrville Folk Festival *2013 First Place Winner (country) of the Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at MerleFest. *2013 Winner Eddie Owen Presents Songwriter Shootout *2014 Top 5 Most Added Record on the Americana Internet Radio Chart == References  *Official website * *Interview with Eliot Bronson *Live from Paste Category:American folk rock musicians Category:Musicians from Baltimore Category:Musicians from Atlanta Category:American pop musicians Category:1979 births Category:American indie pop musicians Category:Living people ","title":"Eliot Bronson"},{"id":"35850559","text":"Ambrose Lomax (15 August 1867 - 20 January 1943) was a South African photographer and chemist. ==Background== Ambrose Lomax was born in England but grew up in the Cape when his family emigrated. He did his apprenticeship as a chemist in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, qualified at the age of 21, before beginning to do relief work. He settled in Molteno, where he started his own business and photographic studio. The premises of his studios, also used as a pharmacy, still exist and are currently a museum. ==Chemist== Lomax was very interested in testing home remedies and how they could be used as formal medicine. When the Molteno bell tower was constructed in 1903, he registered an image of it as his trademark. Several of his brands swiftly became known nationally. He moved to Adelaide, Eastern Cape in 1909 and started a new business as A. Lomax Ltd which was very successful and run by his family after his death.De Kock, W.J. 1968. Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek. Pretoria: Nasionale Raad vir Sosiale Navorsing, Departement van Hoër Onderwys. ==Photographer== Lomax was also known for his early and high quality photographic image of Molteno and its people. He soon produced a renowned artistic collection, though he was as interested in the scientific methods of developing the quality of his images. During the Boer War he took hundreds of photographs of British soldiers and military themes. His collection of negatives was discovered in 1960 when his old photographic studio in Molteno was taken over by a new pharmaceutical firm. Approximately 1400 studies were found, offering a compelling picture of South Africa at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. His photographic art gallery in Molteno is today a prominent attraction.Johannes Meintjes. 1964. Portret van 'n Suid- Afrikaanse Dorp deur Ambrose Lomax. Molteno: Bamboesberg-Uitgewers. ==Private life and family== He was a very quiet man who seldom spoke. His primary pastime other than his work was his passion for golf. He married on 5 May 1904, Ellen Augusta Dodd, of Molteno. Of their eight children, three sons became physicians and a fourth qualified as a pharmacist. ==References== Category:South African photographers Category:South African chemists Category:English emigrants to South Africa Category:1867 births Category:1943 deaths ","title":"Ambrose Lomax"},{"id":"35850563","text":"Luis María Carregado (born October 19, 1950 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a former Argentine footballer who played for clubs of Argentina, Chile and Mexico. ==Teams== * Boca Juniors 1970-1971 * Estudiantes de La Plata 1972 * Boca Juniors 1973-1974 * Unión Española 1975 * Atlante 1976 * San Martín de Tucumán 1977 * All Boys 1978-1980 * Talleres de Remedios de Escalada 1981-1983 ==Titles== * Boca Juniors 1970 (Primera División Argentina Championship) * Unión Española 1975 (Chilean Primera División Championship) ==References== * Profile at BDFA Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Estudiantes de La Plata footballers Category:San Martín de Tucumán footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:All Boys footballers Category:Atlante F.C. footballers Category:Unión Española footballers Category:Chilean Primera División players Category:Argentine Primera División players Category:Liga MX players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Luis María Carregado"},{"id":"35850566","text":"The Bokros package (; named after the then-Minister of Finance Lajos Bokros) was a series of austerity measures announced by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Gyula Horn in Hungary on 12 March 1995. == Background == Having lost the free election in 1990 to the right-wing, reformist parties, the Hungarian Socialist Party, which had been in opposition to the Magyar Democrat Forum's government 1990–1994, won an absolute majority (54.1% of seats) in parliament on the 1994 election, running on a platform of more social harmony and attention to the needs of the poor.Linda J. Cook and Mitchell A. Orenstein, \\"The Return of the Left and Its Impact on the Welfare State in Poland, Hungary, and Russia,\\" in Left Parties and Social Policy in Postcommunist Europe, ed. Linda J. Cook, Mitchell A. Orenstein, and Marilyn Rueschemeyer (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1999), p. 91 Despite winning a majority of seats, the reformed socialists formed a coalition government with the economically liberal Free Democrats. In addition, the socialists themselves were divided between a more traditional leftist wing and an economically liberal wing, some representatives of which could even be characterized as economically to the right of Free Democrats. Indeed, initially the new government initiated negotiations over a 'social pact'; there were also tensions between the prime minister Horn and his finance minister László Békesi, a leading liberal. However, as the danger of a financial crash became evident, the government changed its course, choosing neoliberal shock therapy, arguably well to the right of the previous government's policies. ==Key elements== The catalog of restrictive fiscal policy measures was aimed at preventing the threat of a national bankruptcy.Andreas Schmidt-Schweizer Politische Geschichte Ungarns von 1985 bis 2002: von der liberalisierten Einparteienherrschaft zur Demokratie in der Konsolidierungsphase. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007. p. 293 First, in March 1995 the ministry introduced a mechanism of gradual devaluation of the forint (called crawling peg) to cope with the looming deficit in the balance of accounts. The social benefits were limited in September 1995, tuition fees were introduced, the nominal wages in the public service were to increase from that time on only by 6–15%, which meant in the conditions of an inflation rate of 20% a significant reduction of real wages. In addition to this, the privatization process was accelerated.Andreas Schmidt-Schweizer Politische Geschichte Ungarns von 1985 bis 2002: von der liberalisierten Einparteienherrschaft zur Demokratie in der Konsolidierungsphase. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007. p. 293 == Reactions == The Bokros package sparked fierce criticism and was deeply unpopular with the population.

As a consequence, three ministers resigned.Sándor Kurtán, Karin Liebhart, Andreas Pribersky Ungarn p. 142 Nevertheless, the Prime Minister Horn won the majority of the Socialists behind himself. Thousands participated in a demonstration organized by the Hungarian Teachers' Union on 1 May protesting welfare and education cuts; the head of the teachers' union was Ilona Szőllősi, a Socialist MP, revealing deep splits in the ruling Socialist Party. Szőllősi stated that \\"The economic philosophy the government is pursuing is a wild-liberal, not a socialist policy\\".Cook & Orenstein, 1999, p. 95 == Consequences == The package, including its deep social cuts, has been characterized as the most radical adjustment program ever attempted in Hungary.(Cook & Orenstein, 1999, p. 92) Although the Bokros package had as a result a significant reduction in real income, the Hungarian economy experienced a revival since 1997: 1997–2000 it grew at an annual rate of 4.2% to 5.2%.Peter Matthias Trick: Die Integration Ungarns in den europäischen Wirtschaftsraum: Eine Analyse der außenwirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen Ungarns.

Donations were asked for and architects invited to submit designs. The foundation stone was laid on 26 December 1869, the day of the celebrations. The design chosen was by the master builder of the royal parliament, Hermann Eggert from Berlin, who ran the project from beginning to end. In summer 1872 the 13 foot high rock foundation of the tower was built and in the following winter the earthworks began. In 1873 the first storey was completed. At that point, the money ran out. Not until 1875 was the second storey and internal staircase built. In 1876 the third storey and the dome followed, so that on 6 October that year the topping out ceremony (Richtfest) was celebrated. In 1877 the 26.7 metre-high monument was finally completed. == Literature == * Erich Anmack: Zum 50jährigen Bestehen des E. M. Arndt-Denkmals auf dem Rugard.

Laricks was the season one winner of Fashion Star. ==Personal life== Kara Laricks was a fourth grade elementary school teacher for ten years before she quit to become a fashion designer. She loved design as a child and chose to become a teacher because it was a \\"safe career.\\" Laricks lives and works in New York, New York. Laricks attended the Academy of Art University and graduated in 2008. Laricks is a lesbian who hid her orientation whilst a schoolteacher but remained out personally. She came out publicly on national television during the first season of Fashion Star. She stated she was nervous about coming out on television. ==Professional lifeDesign aesthetic=== Laricks' design aesthetic is very contemporary with men's fashion influences. Laricks cites designer Yohji Yamamoto as her \\"design idol.\\" She finds influence in Yamamoto's \\"minimalistic color palette and the avant garde cut of his designs.\\" Her other favorite designers are Yves Saint Laurent and Jil Sander. She also cites actor Tilda Swinton as a style hero. Laricks has described her design aesthetic as \\"modern-day Annie Hall meets a Japanese street style.\\" Fashion Star As a designer, Laricks has been described as having a \\"unique perspective,\\" by H&M; fashion buyer Nicole Christie. Her first round of designs during the first episode of Fashion Star featured her signature men's tie, which was made from the collars of men's dress shirts. Laricks designed only ties and was almost eliminated from the show. Saks Fifth Avenue fashion buyer Terron Schaefer questioned whether she was a \\"one trick pony,\\" which was challenged after the second episode and Larick designed a drape-tie dress which resulted in a bidding war between the programs buyers. In the final episode of Fashion Star, Laricks introduced a pair of drop crotch pants, similar to harem pants, which Rolling Stone described as \\"a bit too contemporary.\\" Designer John Varvatos called them \\"too crotchety.\\" After presenting three capsule collections to buyers from H&M;, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue, Jessica Simpson responded that Laricks challenged \\"every woman to step outside the box.\\" This outsider design style lends Laricks to being considered a specialty designer. Laricks won the first season of the reality- contest program. Rolling Stone credited the show with embracing an \\"unconventionial\\" designer and applauded the buyers, especially Macy's, for thinking outside the box and awarding Laricks. Laricks was awarded a grand prize of $6 million of purchases by Macy's, H&M; and Saks Fifth Avenue.

She developed emotional brain training, a method of emotional regulation that rapidly reduces stress and promotes rewiring stress-induced problems. == Personal background == Laurel Mellin was born April 17, 1949, in Marin County, California. She is a graduate of Redwood High School and holds a Bachelor of Arts in Humanities from the University of California, Berkeley and a PhD in Health Psychology from Northcentral University. She lives in San Anselmo, CA with her husband, Walt Rose, and has three children: Haley Mellin, Joseph Mellin, and John Rosenthal. == Professional background == Mellin is a health psychologist and an Associate Clinical Professor of Family and Community Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine. Mellin is also the founder of emotional brain training in Larkspur, California, a method for rewiring stress and promoting resilience. The conceptual bases for EBT is brain-based health, using the executive functioning of the brain to rewire the circuits of reflexive responses in the unconscious mind. The approach is based on optimizing personal control over health and well-being and promoting emotional evolution. She teaches UCSF medical students the science and practice of EBT and has authored nine books, and is a New York Times bestselling author. Mellin also directs the nonprofit organization The Solution Foundation, which provides education in using EBT for public health needs. Website: http://www.EBT.org Blog: https://www.brainbasedhealth.org == Emotional brain training == According to EBT, the tools of the method provide the public with more control over the emotional brain, which traditionally has been seen as controlled by mental health professions through psychotherapy, medications, or procedures. With her colleagues at UCSF (Igor Mitrovic, Lynda Frassetto, and Lindsey Fish), she developed the EBT tools as a public health way to switch off and over time, weaken the circuits that are a root cause of up to 90 percent of health problems. Self-help methods have focused on changing the neocortex, however, the faulty emotional circuits that are a root cause of stress overload (allostasis and allostatic load) are stored in the emotional brain. Cognitive tools are effective in low-stress but not in the high-stress levels that are normal in modern life. According to EBT theory, stress is good for people as it activates faulty circuits and it is only when they are activated that emotional processing can change them. The emotional tools of EBT give users a resource for activating and switching off these circuits to promote well-being and lasting improvements in stress-related emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and physiologic problems. The program is evidence-based with ten studies supporting its effectiveness. In 2011, the EBT research team published a summary of this approach to healthcare: rewiring the stress response. == Published works == * Mellin, Laurel.

In Spanish, it is huevos de caballo, cojones de burro, cojón de mico, or cojotón. The name, huevos de caballo, comes from the oval shape of the tree's hanging fruit. It is native to Mexico and Central America. The type locality is San Felipe, Retalhuleu in Guatemala. Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii is similar to Tabernaemontana glabra, except that its leaves and flowers are smaller and its fruit is larger. Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii lives in a variety of habitats, including various types of forest, the forest edge, and pastures. It grows up to tall, although the height is partially dependent on the habitat. Trees living in secondary growth areas, forest edges and pastures are generally shorter but broader than those in forests. The flowers are yellow, and may appear at different times of the year depending on the location. Foster and McDiarmid found that the slow growing fruit is about long and weighs an average of about . The fruit is enclosed in a woody husk which represents more than three-quarters of the fruit's weight. When the fruit is open, a slit forms in the husk permitting access to the arils, each of which covers a seed. The fruit of Tabernaemontana donnell-smithii is eaten by birds such as parrots, and by the white-headed capuchin, and the seeds are eaten by birds such as flycatchers, motmots, honeycreepers, manakins and woodpeckers. Many primarily insectivorous birds eat the fruits opportunistically late in the dry season, when the most of the fruit ripens and when insects are relatively scarce. Its seeds are dispersed primarily by birds. A study by McDiarmid, Ricklefs and Foster found that birds also help the seeds germinate, both by removing the arils from the seeds and also by scarifying the seeds. The bark contains the alkaloids tabernanthine and voacamine.

Prior to his eighteen years in that position he played basketball at UCLA, where he was part of the 1975 team that won that year's NCAA championship, the last for coach John Wooden. He later played at Hawaii, where he set the school's still- standing single-season scoring record of 23.4 points per game. He had a small role as a bartender in Cobb, the 1994 biopic of baseball player Ty Cobb. On the night of May 1, 2012, Smith left a friend's house in Oak Park, California, where he had been staying due to reported marital difficulties. It does not appear he planned to be away long. When he failed to pick up one of his sons for school the next morning, his family reported him missing. Two years later, with Smith still missing and no evidence of his presence anywhere past the night of his disappearance, he was retroactively declared legally dead. Several months later, on October 26, 2014, hikers chanced upon Smith's remains near Palmdale in the Antelope Valley. In January 2015, John Lenzie Creech, a convicted drug dealer who had begun an eight-year prison sentence on that charge shortly after Smith disappeared, was arrested again and charged with the murder. His wife, Chandrika Cade-Creech, had reportedly been romantically involved with Smith. Creech's attorney said the death was a \\"tragic accident\\". According to testimony before the grand jury that indicted Creech on the murder charge, he allegedly beat Smith to death after catching him and his wife together. Creech was convicted of voluntary manslaughter on July 3, 2017. ==Early life and education== A native of the San Fernando Valley, the Gavin Smith was a star player on the Van Nuys High School boys' basketball team in the early 1970s. He was named a second-team All-American by Parade magazine as a senior in 1973. Smith went on to attend the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and play there for coach John Wooden. In his sophomore year he was a forward on the 1975 team which won that year's NCAA championship, Wooden's tenth and last. Smith did not play in UCLA's 92–85 title-game defeat of Kentucky. The next season was his best at UCLA, as he appeared in all but two games, averaging 5.9 points per game (ppg). In the 1976 Final Four, he appeared twice. Against Indiana, the eventual champs, he scored six points, adding eight points and four rebounds in the third-place game victory over Rutgers. After the season, he transferred to Hawaii for a season and finished his playing career there, setting the school's single-season scoring record of 23.4 ppg, a mark that still stands despite the subsequent introduction of the three-point field goal. While at Hawaii, Smith became recognizable for complementing his then long hair with a bandana, and bringing his dog to practice. Former Rainbow Warriors coach Riley Wallace, who coached against Smith at the time, remembered him as a formidable opponent. \\"He frustrated me as a coach,\\" Wallace recalls. \\"He could score from anywhere on the floor ... [he was] probably one of the best shooters in the history of Hawaii.\\" ==Career== Smith eventually began a career in the film industry, at first in front of the camera. He made his acting debut playing a bodyguard in a televised adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Glitz. The following year, he had a small role in Greg Mottola's debut short, \\"Swingin' in the Painter's Room.\\" After playing a bartender in the 1994 film Cobb, a biopic of baseball player Ty Cobb, Smith went into the business side of the industry as an executive. He took a job in 20th Century Fox's distribution department, making sure that films got to the theaters they were scheduled to appear in. While he was not involved with the creative aspect of the business, he has been credited with helping films such as Titanic, Avatar and the rereleases of the original Star Wars trilogy succeed. By 2012 he was Fox's regional branch manager for theaters in the Dallas and Oklahoma City areas, working out of the company's Calabasas offices. According to friends, he had talked about returning to acting when he retired from Fox, as he expected to do in a few years. ==Personal life== He had settled in the West Hills area of the Valley with his wife, Lisa, and their three sons. One of his sons, Evan, played basketball for University of Southern California. In the meantime, his success was offset by marital, financial and substance abuse difficulties. He spent time in drug rehab. Regarding the Smiths' financial problems, they had bought their house when the market was booming and prices were high. \\"Upside-down\\" as a result of the Panic of 2008, the market value of his home plunged to less than the balance owed on the mortgage, leaving him under significant pressure, steeped in a negative equity position. They were trying to sell the house. ==Disappearance== Smith attended CinemaCon, the annual convention of the National Association of Theatre Owners in Las Vegas. Upon his return to the Los Angeles area, he went not to his West Hills home but, due to recent problems in his marriage, that of a female colleague and family friend who lived on Kellwood Court in nearby Oak Park. The Smith family says the overnight stay at Gavin's friend's home was planned. Recent marital difficulties had led Evan Smith to criticize his father for \\"leaving the family\\" in a tweet (since deleted) two weeks earlier. He reportedly stopped speaking to Gavin as well. Evan later denied his parents were separating, saying \\"they were just going through normal stuff couples go through.\\" According to the friend Smith was staying with, the two were up watching television until sometime after 9 p.m. When the friend went to bed, Smith told her he would be following shortly. Instead, around 10 p.m., he apparently got into his black 2000 Mercedes-Benz E420 with California license plate 6EKT044, and left. One report claims someone on the street actually saw the car as it departed. Lisa Smith, who had been busy attending to her ill mother, says she spoke with him during the day to arrange for him to pick up one of their other sons from school the morning of May 2. His family agreed it was unlike Smith to leave the house in the late evening without plans to do so, or at least giving notice that the trip was unplanned. Their family friend reported that when she last saw Smith he was wearing the purple workout pants he had borrowed from Evan, with the intent of wearing them off to bed. This choice of clothing, they believe, makes it unlikely Smith's sudden departure was expected, or that he was going somewhere he anticipated being seen. Furthermore, that he had left his cellphone charger, a shaving kit, and other personal belongings at the Oak Park residence, likelihood loomed large Smith did not expect anything beyond an immediate return. In May 2014, two years after Smith was last seen, law enforcement officials declared Gavin Smith dead and a judge issued a death certificate. His date of death was declared to have been the night he disappeared. \\"I think the idea of a person that goes missing out of nowhere is intriguing and tragic,\\" said a spokesman for the LACSD. ===Investigation=== When Smith did not show up the next morning, at work nor to pick up his son, his family and coworkers reported him missing. Among the personal belongings that he did take with him when he left the Oak Park house were his cell phone and credit cards. Neither had been used since his disappearance. They could not identify anyone who might have had a reason to harm him, but believed that his fate or whereabouts were known. \\"We know someone knows something. There's no doubt that someone knows something,\\" Smith's wife said. They believed his clothing and general appearance would not go unnoticed or unremembered. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LACSD) was leading the investigation. They had suggested that they had pings from Smith's cell phone after 10 p.m. the night he disappeared, although they did not make the specifics public. \\"He was bouncing around the Valley or, at least, his phone was,\\" said LACSD Sgt. John O'Brien. \\"We are talking about after bars close.\\" On May 8, a male body was found in the Angeles National Forest near the Angeles Crest Highway above La Cañada Flintridge, but it was not Smith's. The Smiths and their friends had been looking in ravines in the area or other places where his car might have gone off the road, without success. A volunteer search of remote areas planned for the weekend of May 19–20 was called off due to the lack of \\"a specific area of defined interest\\" in which to search. Flyers were distributed and the LACSD had a special hotline number which, it said, received \\"lots of tips\\". The family had put up a blog dedicated to the search and was offering a $20,000 reward. Evan Smith had been using his Twitter feed to spread the word on the search as well. A possible sighting of Smith subsequent to the disappearance was reported at the end of the month. David Brill of Madison, Wisconsin, who had been traveling to Southern California on business around the time Smith disappeared, told a TV station in his hometown that he had seen Smith with a woman at a restaurant in Morro Bay on May 7. The next morning he read the story online and identified Smith as the man. The waitress who served the man also believed him to be Smith, and said that he paid in cash and told her that he and his companion would be staying in town for a couple of days and then continuing north up the Pacific coast. The restaurant claimed to have a security camera tape but would not release it to the media. On June 8, police, accompanied by a SWAT team, executed a search warrant at a Canoga Park home belonging to a couple identified as John and Chandrika Creech, in connection with the case. After five hours, they emerged with several boxes and a computer, and towed away a black Audi sport-utility vehicle. Although searches like this are unusual in a missing-persons case, and homicide detectives were reportedly among the investigators present, the LACSD emphasized that it was still a missing- persons case and no evidence of foul play had yet been discovered. A lawyer for the Creeches who spoke with reporters at the scene said it was the second search of the house in the past month, but refused to comment further. Later, it was reported that more than 20 search warrants had been issued so far and police had seized cellphones and other files from the Creech house. Two weeks later, more details about why the Creeches' house might have been searched were reported. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Dolson said Gavin Smith met Chandrika Creech while they were both in drug rehab, and that they were in a romantic relationship. After it had started in 2008, she had broken it off at the request of her husband John Creech, a convicted drug dealer who was facing new charges at the time of the search, and had reportedly had no contact with Smith other than an email exchange in 2008. Smith's family and friends spent the second weekend of July passing out fliers and putting up posters in Sylmar, the city's northernmost neighborhood. According to them, the detectives investigating Smith's disappearance said his last cellphone ping had come from the area. \\"The police have led us specifically to this area,\\" she said to reporters. Since the search of the Creeches, the LACSD had not made any more public moves related to the case. John Creech pleaded guilty to the drug charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison in September 2012. America's Most Wanted did a segment on the case in October. Confronted by his wife, Smith initially broke off the affair with Creech. In 2010 however, Smith and Creech resumed their relationship and had begun exchanging romantic messages. Smith's wife discovered the messages and, in an impulsive decision, drove her two sons to Creech’s home where they told John Creech of the affair. He initially indicated his intent to kill their father, but later relented, telling the sons, \\"... you just saved your father's life by coming here today.\\" In 2012, when the romance rekindled yet again, Creech allegedly made good on his threat, stalking Chandrika Creech using a cell phone GPS tracking application to follow her to the point of the rendezvous. Creech then allegedly pummeled Smith to his death, temporarily ditched his car and body at an accomplice's garage near Porter Ranch after the killing, and returned later to retrieve the body and tow Smith's car to a secluded, clandestine location. In August, Fox cleaned out Smith's office, and sent anything that the police did not need for their investigation to the Smiths' home. Gavin Smith's sister Tara Addeo, and John Creech's lawyer, Daniel Teola, told The Hollywood Reporter that the LACSD's search of the Creech residence had not yielded anything of use. She had nevertheless come to believe that he had become the victim of a crime. \\"I know that Gavin would not hurt himself, and I have a hard time believing that Gavin would ever walk away from his sons,\\" she said. \\"The only other alternative is that there would have been foul play.\\" A month later Lisa Smith told the Reporter that she had reached a similar conclusion. \\"I just don't picture him walking in and saying, 'I'm sorry; I just needed a breather.' I'm prepared for the worst.\\" On January 23, 2013, a vehicle seized at an unrelated Granada Hills drug bust turned out to belong to Creech. It led investigators to Gavin's missing Mercedes, found a month later at a Simi Valley storage facility, also connected with Creech, whom police continued to describe as a person of interest. In March 2013, a sheriff's statement said detectives were now investigating the case as a homicide, although Gavin's body had not been found. Officials also revealed that they believed they had identified the motive in the alleged crime. However, citing the ongoing investigation, they declined to elaborate on the possible motive or any other details of the case. Discovery of body On October 26, 2014, Smith's body was found in Palmdale, California. A group of hikers found a shallow grave containing a skull, some bones, and clothing in a rural area between Palmdale and Acton just outside the Angeles National Forest. Authorities announced the body's discovery 11 days later, after it had been positively identified as Smith. The cause of his death was not initially known, as the county coroner's office was working to establish it. Investigators said it might take some time to do so, if indeed they could. \\"It could be months, if ever, worst-case scenario,\\" said a spokesman for the coroner. Nevertheless, the Los Angeles Times quoted anonymous sources as saying that investigators believe that Smith was killed at the direction of one person, by others with experience in violent crime. At a press conference held the day the body's discovery was announced, investigators shared more information. Their theory was that Smith was killed in his car shortly after he disappeared. Based on that evidence, they had \\"confidently labeled Smith's death a homicide\\" after finding the car in 2013. They believed the death would prove to be the result of blunt force trauma; although they could not yet rule out gunshot wounds they did not believe that there would be any. Arrest In January 2015, a little over three months after Smith's body was discovered, Creech, two years into an eight-year sentence, was rearrested and charged with his murder. The arraignment was postponed for a month. Creech's attorney called Smith's death a \\"tragic accident\\", saying his client was innocent of the murder charge. \\"There may have been a fight, but I can tell you there was no criminal intent,\\" said Alex Kessel. In May of that year, the prosecution released transcripts of testimony before the grand jury that indicted Creech on murder charges. According to witnesses, on the night of May 1 he borrowed a van and went to where Smith had parked his Mercedes with Chandrika Creech. Surprising them there, he beat Smith severely while Chandrika, who believed she would be next, escaped and screamed for help. Later Creech, who did not initially believe Smith had been fatally injured, drove Smith's car to Stan McQuay's home in Porter Ranch. He and McQuay then extracted Smith's body and disposed of it, wrapped in a bloodied sheet, and buried it in a shallow grave east of Acton in the Antelope Valley off Angeles Forest Highway. McQuay temporarily stored Smith's missing vehicle in his garage one week from the night of Smith's murder, affording Creech time sufficient to make clandestine arrangements for its long term concealment; it was then parked in a car-sized room at a public storage facility just west of McQuay's Porter Ranch residence, in Simi Valley. ==Trial and conviction== John Creech was accused by prosecutors of first-degree murder. They said he tracked his wife Chandrika and Gavin Smith through hidden GPS, and made good on his earlier threat to kill Smith if the affair continued.https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Mans-Conviction-Upheld-for- Fox-Executives-Beating-Death-507064261.html Creech testified in his own defense, saying that he had been attacked by Smith, and fought to save himself. He admitted that he should have called 911 to administer to Smith afterward. Faced with a choice of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or voluntary manslaughter, the jury took only one hour to acquit on the first two charges, and to convict on voluntary manslaughter. Two months after the July 2017 verdict, the judge sentenced Creech to the maximum sentence allowed by law: 11 years behind bars. All the others involved in helping Creech dispose of the evidence were given plea deals by the prosecution in exchange for their testimony against Creech. None served jail time. ==References * Category:1954 births Category:2014 deaths Category:2012 murders in the United States Category:American film studio executives Category:Basketball players from California Category:Hawaii Rainbow Warriors basketball players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:UCLA Bruins men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 1976 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:People declared dead in absentia Category:Sportspeople from Ventura County, California Category:Crimes in California Category:Formerly missing people found dead Category:People murdered in Los Angeles Category:Deaths by beating in the United States Category:People from West Hills, Los Angeles Category:American men's basketball players Category:Missing person cases in California Category:Forwards (basketball) ","title":"Gavin Smith (film studio executive)"},{"id":"35850921","text":"thumb Helgi Hjörvar (born 9 June 1967 in Reykjavík, Iceland) is an Icelandic politician.

The limestone cave has been closed to the public for some time, due to concerns over the safety aspect, but new safety checks reveal that it is probably not as bad as had been first envisaged and the cave hosted a “by invitation only” charity event in January 2012. It is hoped that this may lead to more similar events, or even permanent re-opening, or as envisaged by the local authority, as a classroom for visiting schools and for other special events. This area of the seafront (and of Roker itself), which has a rich history, was declared a Conservation Area in 1995 in recognition of its architectural and historic interest.

In the entrance was a small figure, said to be Spottee who was turned to stone by a witch he argued with and was still visible in the entrance up until the late 1970s, now covered by 'rubble' (all figures approximate) ==Legend== It gets its name from the stranded foreign sailor who could not speak English, and as he could not converse with the locals, he was thought by some to be a poor lunatic, and is so referred to in The Bishoprick Garland by (Sir) Cuthbert Sharp. He earned his name “Spottee” from the spotted shirt he wore.

It has a steep snout, and, like other wolffish, has long, canine teeth that protrude out past the tips of the jaws. It can grow to 112 cm and 15 kg in weight, is dark brown in colour and lacks any distinct markings other than some slight blotching or palish marbling. The head of juveniles may have multiple dark spots and four to five dark coloured longitudinal stripes on the upper body. The head length is approximately 19 to 21 percent of the total body length. This species differs from the five other species in the genus in having at least 53 anal rays, 81 to 86 dorsal fin spines, and more rounded, deeper caudal fins. ==Distribution== The Bering wolffish species has an inconsistent distribution. It is found from the Northeastern Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido to the Sea of Okhotsk, to Alaska. Although insufficiently documented, it is also known to occur across the Northwestern Pacific, the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. ==Habitat== The Bering wolffish lives on rocky, gravel and sandy substrates, and algae-encrusted bottoms in shallow, inshore locations. ==Behaviour== 150px Bering wolffishes are known to practice nesting habits. They produce very big eggs which hatch into larvae remaining in the pelagic zone. ==Diet== Benthic invertebrates such as crabs and molluscs. == References Further reading== *Fruge, D.J., and Wiswar, D.W. 1991.

It was shown at film festivals in 2011 and placed in general release by Kino Lorber in 2012. 5 Broken Cameras is a first-hand account of protests in Bil'in, a West Bank village affected by the Israeli West Bank barrier. The documentary was shot almost entirely by Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat, who bought his first camera in 2005 to record the birth of his youngest son. In 2009 Israeli co-director Guy Davidi joined the project. Structured around the destruction of Burnat's cameras, the filmmakers' collaboration follows one family's evolution over five years of turmoil. The film won a 2012 Sundance Film Festival award, it won the Golden Apricot at the 2012 Yerevan International Film Festival, Armenia, for Best Documentary Film, won the 2013 International Emmy Award, and was nominated for a 2013 Academy Award. ==Synopsis== There are five cameras — each with its own story. When his fourth son, Gibreel, is born in 2005, self-taught cameraman Emad Burnat, a Palestinian villager, gets his first camera. At the same time in his village of Bil’in, the Israelis begin bulldozing village olive groves to build a barrier to separate Bil'in from the Jewish Settlement Modi'in Illit. The barrier's route cuts off 60% of Bil'in farmland and the villagers resist this seizure of more of their land by the settlers. During the next year, Burnat films this struggle, which is led by two of his best friends including his brother Iyad, while at the same time recording the growth of his son. Very soon, these events begin to affect his family and his own life. Emad films the Army and Police beating and arresting villagers and activists who come to support them. Settlers destroy Palestinian olive trees and attack Burnat when he tries to film them. The Army raids the village in the middle of the night to arrest children. He, his friends, and brothers are arrested or shot; some are killed. Each camera used to document these events is shot or smashed. Eventually, in 2009, Burnat approaches Guy Davidi – an Israeli filmmaker and together, from these five broken cameras and the stories that they represent, these two filmmakers create the film. ==ProductionBackground and Emad Burnat=== Israel began construction of an Israeli West Bank barrier in the West Bank village of Bil’in, Palestine in 2005. Discovering that the wall would cut through their agricultural land, confiscating half of it, the villagers initiated popular protests and were joined by Israeli and international activists. At that point Burnat received a camera to document the movement. In 2007 the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the barrier rerouted, and four years later, after village access to some of the land was restored, the demonstrations were called off. A case against Canada, for failing to prevent Canadian corporations from being complicit in the building of the settlements, is currently pending before the UN Human Rights Committee. The first year, Burnat filmed mainly to serve the purposes of activists. His footage was introduced as evidence in Israeli court and posted on YouTube to spread awareness of the growing movement. As media interest in Bil’in grew, Burnat's footage gained international recognition and was used by local and international news agencies. He started working as a freelance photographer for Reuters and provided footage documenting the villagers' fight to professional filmmakers. This footage was used in such notable films as Shai Carmeli Pollac's Bil’in, My Love and Guy Davidi's and Alesandre Goetschmann Interrupted Streams. ===Pre-Production and Guy Davidi=== Burnat was approached in 2009 by Greenhouse, a Mediterranean film development project, to develop a documentary. The project focused on the non-violent movement and especially on Bassem Abu-Rahme, who was killed earlier that year at a demonstration in Bil’in. After some difficulties, Burnat approached Israeli filmmaker, Guy Davidi who had just finished editing “Interrupted Streams”, Davidi's first feature documentary which was released in 2010 at the Jerusalem International Film Festival. Earlier, Davidi had been involved in the left-wing organizations Indymedia and Anarchists Against the Wall. “Until my twenties,” Davidi has said in an interview, “it was very hard for me to work in Israel. I felt it was a very destructive environment, a very violent environment.... There is a lot of aggression expressed towards the arts in Israel. I connect it completely with the political situation....So I left for Paris and I found time to reflect on my life.... I kind of found a freedom in Paris and I wanted to express it as well in Israel. And ever since my life was connected with the West Bank.” Davidi provided Burnat's film with a new concept: Burnat himself, the cameraman, would be the protagonist, and the story would be told from his point of view. Davidi also proposed that the film be structured around the history of the destruction of Burnat's cameras. Footage that Burnat shot of his family was also incorporated into the film, thus enhancing the personal element. Beginning in 2009, Burnat, adhering to the new concept for the film, focused more extensively on his family's reactions to events. A few important scenes shot by other cameramen (including Guy Davidi) were used to supplement the narrative, and to introduce Burnat as a character. ===Editing=== Starting in 2009, Davidi worked on the voice-overs and structuring the film. In 2011 French editor Véronique Lagoarde–Ségot joined the project to edit the final cut of the 90-minute film and to create the 52-minute television version. The film takes the form of a diary, and is divided into 5 sections, each of which recounts the story of one of the five cameras that Burnat used over the years. In a prologue, Burnat is shown with his 5 broken cameras laid out on a table. This scene is returned to at the end of the film. Title cards identifying the time periods during which each camera was used are shown at the start of each episode as well as the epilogue. The story shifts frequently between the dramatic public events in the village and the highly intimate scenes involving Burnat's family. The most prominent narrative is of Burnat's fourth son Gibreel, whose growth throughout almost 6 years is documented in the film. The birth of Gibreel occurs at the same time as the birth of the non-violent movement in the village; later in the film, Gibreel's first words are “wall” and “cartridge,” uttered when he crosses the barrier with his brothers and finally writes his name on the second concrete wall at the end of the film. Beginning with the episode involving the third camera, the personal and village movement narratives grow more integrated. Burnat becomes more conspicuous as a protagonist. First he is placed under house arrest and films himself, then he is filmed at the moment a bullet directly hits his third camera. ===Funding=== The film was initially developed by the Greenhouse Development Project, a Mediterranean development project initiated by an Israeli foundation and sponsored by the European Union. Later it received funding from international and Israeli sources such as the New Israeli Cinema Fund (Israel), the Jan Vrijman Fund (Netherland), ITVS (USA). Still later, funding was provided by Israel's Channel 8, Dutch Television IKON, and sources in Canada, South Korea, and the UK. Ultimately French television and the CNC French Cinema Fund provided help. It was pitched at the 2010 Sheffield Doc/Fest MeetMarket. ==Reception== 5 Broken Cameras has received positive reviews from numerous critics. It has a fresh rating of 96%, based on 48 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes. It also has a score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/5-broken-cameras A.O. Scott of The New York Times while stating that the film was “unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again” and was a “hardly neutral...piece of advocacy journalism,” also said that it was a \\"visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art\\" that deserved \\"to be appreciated for the lyrical delicacy of [Burnat's] voice and the precision of his eye.\\" Artinfo magazine's J. Hoberman noted that the documentary was \\"gripping from the get go\\" and that seeing it is to \\"wonder what it would have been like to have a black Alabaman’s 8mm documentation of the civil rights struggle.\\" Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York gave the film four stars, describing it as a \\"proudly defiant work, devoted to a community and created by its members\\" that shows the \\"largely unreported details\\" of normal life in the West Bank. An NPR review of the film noted that it “is unabashedly pro-Palestinian, an indictment of Israel's settlement policy that never examines either the settlers' claims or the security forces' point of view” and quoted Anav Silverman of the Tazpit News Agency as saying that “the conflict in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] has become a camera war.” ===Reception in Israel=== The film was released in Israel in July 2012 and immediately won the Best Documentary Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, where it competed against another Oscar-nominated film, \\"The Gatekeepers.\\" The film also received an award named after the slain Palestinian-Israeli filmmaker Juliano Mer Khamis, at the Cinema South Film Festival in Sderot. In Israel, 5 Broken Cameras received overwhelming positive reviews, with Timeout Israel calling it “a masterpiece” and Israeli film critic Shmulik Duvdevani naming it \\"the most important cinematic event of the year.\\" Even Israel's most popular right-wing newspaper, Israel Hayom, called the film \\"the best documentary of the year\\" (2012). Both directors, Guy Davidi and Emat Burnat, also appeared on the cover of the cultural weekend section of Israel's leading newspaper, Yediot Achronot. In 2013 the film was nominated for the Israeli Film Academy's award (Ophir Award) for Best Documentary. There was also considerable negative response to the film in Israel, however. Davidi said that when he first screened the film for Israeli high school students, “they got angry at me, accused me of lying and being a traitor. But the anger is really against the whole system that lied to them....So I tell the kids, ‘Go ahead and get mad at me. Take it all out on me. Soon you will realize that your anger is not against me, but against the whole system that lied to you.’” According to the AP, the film “has infuriated people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide,” with some Israelis “asking why the government helped fund a film so scathing in its criticism of its own policies, while Palestinians are shocked that the film is winning accolades for being 'Israeli.'” The Israeli nonprofit Consensus petitioned the Israeli Attorney General claiming that Davidi and Burnat “should be charged with slander and prosecuted for 'incitement.'” === Reaction to the Oscar Nomination in Israel=== When the film was nominated for an Oscar, the Israeli media referred to it as an Israeli film that would be representing Israel at the Academy Awards, even though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not consider films nominated in the documentary category as representing their countries of origin. In addition, the fact that the film was also a Palestinian work often went unmentioned. Davidi sparked controversy and was criticized by Israeli officials when he stated in an interview that “he does not represent Israel, only himself.” There was considerable controversy over whether the film should be identified as an Israeli or Palestinian production. Burnat described it as a “Palestinian film” while Davidi said it was “first and foremost...a Palestinian film\\" in contradiction of the Israeli embassy in the United States which in a tweet identified it as an Israeli film. Davidi told The Forward that \\"the film is not representing a country\\" and for him \\"films have no nationalities; the film is a Palestinian-Israeli-French co- production, [with] Israeli and Palestinian directors and a story that is told [with] Palestinian characters and in the West Bank.\\" ===Palestinian response=== Burnat was criticized in Ramallah for working with Israelis, and Davidi was made to feel that “I had not sufficiently proved myself. I thought to myself that maybe we needed an Israeli activist to die in order to win credibility. Perhaps not enough Israeli blood has been spilled.” ==Awards== 5 Broken Cameras won the World Cinema Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. it won the 2013 International Emmy Award. The film also received the Special Broadcaster IDFA Audience Award and the Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2011. In addition, the film won the Golden Apricot at the 2012 Yerevan International Film Festival, for Best Documentary Film, the Van Leer Group Foundation Award for Best Israeli Documentary at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2012, and the Busan Cinephile Award at the 17th Busan International Film Festival in 2012. The film also won Sheffield Doc/Fest Audience Award at the 2012 Sheffield Doc/Fest. 5 Broken Cameras was nominated for Best Documentary Feature in the 85th Academy Awards, and for the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Documentary of 2012. ==See also== * List of Palestinian films ==References* * * Category:2011 documentary films Category:Arabic- language films Category:Hebrew-language films Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Israeli films Category:Palestinian documentary films Category:Documentary films about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Category:Documentary films about films Category:Nonviolence Category:Documentary films about citizen media Category:Films directed by Guy Davidi Category:International Emmy Award winners Category:Filmed killings ","title":"5 Broken Cameras"},{"id":"35851074","text":"Steve Marshall may refer to: *Steve Marshall (politician) (born 1964), Attorney General of Alabama *Steve Marshall (magician), magician, clown, writer and artist *Steve Marshall (wrestler) (born 1960), Canadian wrestler ==See also== * Stephen Marshall (disambiguation) * Steven Marshall (born 1968), Australian politician * Steven Marshall (volleyball) (born 1989), Canadian volleyball player ","title":"Steve Marshall"},{"id":"35851094","text":"Mörður Árnason (born 30 October 1953) is an Icelandic politician.

In 1967 Stinco and fellow-architects Jean Aubert and Jean- Paul Jungmann formed the group \\"Utopie\\" along with sociologists Hubert Tonka, Jean Baudrillard and others. Their goal was to create buildings that would be buoyant, mobile and ephemeral, in contrast to the intert and repressed post- war architecture of the time. The architects organized an exhibition in March 1968 at the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris called \\"Structures Gonflables\\". Stinco contributed the design for an inflatable mobile exhibition hall in which everyday things would be exhibited, drawing on the work of German structural engineer Frei Otto for the bubble-based form and on the philosophy of the Marxist Henri Lefebvre for the commonplace exhibits. ==Later work and philosophy== Stinco later moved into a more conventional office-based architectural practice. From 1974 to 1976 he participated with GAU (Urban Architecture Group) in a project to renew urban architecture in France. In 1984 he opened his own architectural firm. Between 1993 and 1999 he taught in the sculpture department at the Beaux-Art in Paris. He was given the job of renovating the 1968 Maison de la Culture in Grenoble and adding a new wing, with the work completed in 2004. He said that he saw the challenge as \\"unlocking a building suspended above a green space, without resisting its architecture. I did not want to arrive at a vocabulary that opposed this building which symbolizes Grenoble's 'heroic period'...\\". Talking of his construction of new buildings at the Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers, he said \\"I set myself a rule: release me from flat and literal compliance with the architecture of the past, and also from the ridiculous fear of not being 'modern'\\". ==Sample projects== With his company he specializes in construction and renovation of museums and exhibition rooms.

The stream rises in McMinn County and flows toward the northeast, paralleling the trend of the valleys and ridges, for through Monroe and Loudon counties, entering Watts Bar Reservoir in Loudon County at a location downstream from the city of Loudon and a short distance upstream from the I-75 bridge. It flows through the city of Sweetwater in Monroe County and provides most of that city's public water supply. The towns of Niota and Philadelphia are also located along Sweetwater Creek. Bacon Creek is a named tributary to Sweetwater Creek. ==Name== The name \\"Sweetwater\\" is thought to derive from the high quality of the water obtained from springs in the stream's valley. In the 1910s, local historian W.B. Lenoir concocted a different version of the name's origin. In a 1913 newspaper article and 1916 book, he reported that the name came from early white settlers' interpretation of \\"Soitee Woitee\\", the Cherokee name for the stream and its associated valley, which name he said meant \\"happy homes.\\". Reprinted 1976 by Regional Publishing Company: . He later admitted that this was a made- up story with no factual basis. ==Watershed characteristics and hydrology== The stream drains a watershed of 38,844 acres (60.69 square miles or 157 km2). Much of the watershed is underlain by carbonate (dolomite and limestone) bedrock. Sinkholes and other topographic features characteristic of karst hydrology are present. As is typical of carbonate landscapes, there is significant interaction between groundwater and the stream. A large fraction of the stream's flow enters from groundwater, particularly during dry periods. Streamflow was measured from 1964 through 1981 at two gauging stations located downstream from Sweetwater. The gauging site used from 1964 to April 1970 had a drainage area of and the site used from May 1970 through 1981 had a drainage area of . Annual average flows measured at these sites ranged from 35 to 83 cubic feet per second (86–203 million liters/day). The lowest observed daily average flow was 4.3 cubic feet per second (10 million liters/day), in 1980, and the highest daily average was 887 cubic feet per second (2.2 billion liters/day), in 1973. During the unusually dry weather conditions of 1980, three-quarters of the stream's flow is estimated to have been groundwater inflow. ==Uses and water quality== Sweetwater Creek provides the majority of the public water supply that is provided to the city of Sweetwater by the Sweetwater Utilities Board. Daily withdrawals averaged 810,000 gallons (3.1 million liters) as of 2000 and were expected to increase to more than 1.1 million gallons (4.2 million liters) by 2030. The city also receives an average of 540,000 gallons (2 million liters) per day of groundwater from a spring. Because the city's water requirements represent a large fraction of Sweetwater Creek streamflow during dry periods, there has been some concern that water supply may not be adequate to meet the city's future needs. Most of the creek watershed is in forest (42%) and agricultural uses (40% pasture and hay land and 12% cropland). In 2002, there were 1,825 beef cows, 675 milk cows, 720 horses, 25 hogs, 30 sheep, and 110,500 poultry animals housed in the watershed. Residential and urban uses occupy about 6% of the watershed area. As of 1997, there were 3,640 people using septic systems in the watershed. Treated effluent from Sweetwater's sewage treatment plant is discharged to the stream. The stream is considered to have impaired water quality due to elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria, nitrates, and sediment, which are attributed to factors including sewage effluent discharge, grazing and concentrated feeding of farm animals, land development, and channelization. ==See also== *List of rivers of Tennessee ==References== Category:Tributaries of the Tennessee River Category:Rivers of Tennessee Category:Rivers of Loudon County, Tennessee Category:Rivers of McMinn County, Tennessee Category:Rivers of Monroe County, Tennessee ","title":"Sweetwater Creek (Tennessee River tributary)"},{"id":"35851124","text":"Alpha-substitution reactions occur at the position next to the carbonyl group, the α-position, and involve the substitution of an α hydrogen atom by an electrophile, E, through either an enol or enolate ion intermediate. 390px ==Reaction mechanism== Because their double bonds are electron rich, enols behave as nucleophiles and react with electrophiles in much the same way that alkenes do. But because of resonance electron donation of a lonepair of electrons on the neighboring oxygen, enols are more electron- rich and correspondingly more reactive than alkenes. Notice in the following electrostatic potential map of ethenol (H2C=CHOH) how there is a substantial amount of electron density on the α carbon. Alpha substitution mechanism2 When an alkene reacts with an electrophile, such as HCl, initial addition of H+ gives an intermediate cation and subsequent reaction with Cl− yields an addition product. When an enol reacts with an electrophile, however, only the initial addition step is the same. Instead of reacting with CI− to give an addition product, the intermediate cation loses the OH− proton to give an α-substituted carbonyl compound. ==Alpha-halogenation of aldehydes and ketones== A particularly common α-substitution reaction in the laboratory is the halogenation of aldehydes and ketones at their α positions by reaction Cl2, Br2 or I2 in acidic solution. Bromine in acetic acid solvent is often used. Remarkably, ketone halogenation also occurs in biological systems, particularly in marine alga, where dibromoacetaldehyde, bromoacetone, 1, l,l -tribromoacetone, and other related compounds have been found. The halogenation is a typical α-substitution reaction that proceeds by acid catalyzed formation of an enol intermediate. ==Acidity of alpha-hydrogen atoms: enolate ion formation== A hydrogen on the α position of a carbonyl compound is weakly acidic and can be removed by a strong base to yield an enolate ion. In comparing acetone (pKa= 19.3) with ethane (pKa= 60), for instance, the presence of a neighboring carbonyl group increases the acidity of the ketone over the alkane by a factor of 1040. Abstraction of a proton from a carbonyl compound occurs when the a C-H bond is oriented roughly parallel to the p orbitals of the carbonyl group. The α carbon atom of the enolate ion is sp2-hybridized and has a p orbital that overlaps the neighboring carbonyl p orbitals. Thus, the negative charge is shared by the electronegative oxygen atom, and the enolate ion is stabilized by resonance. Carbonyl compounds are more acidic than alkanes for the same reason that carboxylic acids are more acidic than alcohols. In both cases, the anions are stabilized by resonance. Enolate ions differ from carboxylate ions, however, in that their two resonance forms are not equivalent- the form with the negative charge on oxygen is lower in energy than the form with the charge on carbon. Nevertheless, the principle behind resonance stabilization is the same in both cases. Because carbonyl compounds are only weakly acidic, a strong base is needed for enolate ion formation . If an alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide is used as base, deprotonation takes place only to the extent of about 0.1% because acetone is a weaker acid than ethanol (pKa= 16). If, however, a more powerful base such as sodium hydride (NaH) or lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is used, a carbonyl compound can be completely converted into its enolate ion. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), which is easily prepared by reaction of the strong base butyllithium with diisopropylamine, is widely used in the laboratory as a base for preparing enolate ions from carbonyl compounds. Many types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA. Note that nitriles, too, are acidic and can be converted into enolate-like anions (referred to as nitrile anions). When a hydrogen atom is flanked by two carbonyl groups, its acidity is enhanced even more. This enhanced acidity of β-dicarbonyl compounds is due to the stabilization of the resultant enolate ions by delocalization of the negative charge over both carbonyl groups. ==Reactivity of enolate ions== Enolate ions are more useful than enols for two reasons. First, pure enols can't normally be isolated but are instead generated only as short lived intermediates in low concentration. By contrast, stable solutions of pure enolate ions are easily prepared from most carbonyl compounds by reaction with a strong base. Second, enolate ions are more reactive than enols and undergo many reactions that enols don't. Whereas enols are neutral, enolate ions are negatively charged, making them much better nucleophiles. As a result, enolate ions are more common than enols in both laboratory and biological chemistry. Because they are resonance hybrids of two nonequivalent forms, enolate ions can be looked at either as vinylic alkoxides (C=C- O−) or as α-ketocarbanions (−C-C= O). Thus, enolate ions can react with electrophiles either on oxygen or on carbon. Reaction on oxygen yields an enol derivative, while reaction on carbon yields an α-substituted carbonyl compound. Both kinds of reactivity are known, but reaction on carbon is more common. ==Alkylation of enolate ions== Perhaps the single most important reaction of enolate ions is their alkylation by treatment with an alkyl halide or tosylate, thereby forming a new C-C bond and joining two smaller pieces into one larger molecule. Alkylation occurs when the nucleophilic enolate ion reacts with the electrophilic alkyl halide in an SN2 reaction and displaces the leaving group by backside attack. Alkylation Alkylation reactions are subject to the same constraints that affect all SN2 reactions. Thus, the leaving group X in the alkylating agent R-X can be chloride, bromide, iodide, or tosylate . Tile alkyl group R should be primary or methyl, and preferably should be allylic or benzylic. Secondary halides react poorly, and tertiary halides don't react at all because a competing E2 elimination of HX occurs instead. Vinylic and aryl halides are also unreactive because backside approach is sterically prevented. ==References== Category:Substitution reactions Category:Organic reactions ","title":"Carbonyl alpha-substitution reactions"},{"id":"35851133","text":"Valgerður Bjarnadóttir (born 13 January 1950) is an Icelandic politician. ==References External links == * Non auto-biography of Valgerður Bjarnadóttir on the parliament website Valgerdur Bjarnadottir Category:Living people Category:1950 births Valgerdur Bjarnadottir Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Valgerður Bjarnadóttir"},{"id":"35851139","text":"Valentine (1832) is a novel published by French author George Sand. This was the second novel published in Sand's career as an independent author, the novel is notable for displaying many of Sand's preoccupations as an emerging novelist: love, social class, greed, liberty, and family ties. Like many of Sand's novels, the novel takes its name from its title character Valentine, who is born into an aristocratic family but falls in love with the peasant farmer, Benedict. Star-crossed lovers belonging to different social classes were to become a major theme in Sand's works, which interrogated what the author perceived as the hypocrisy and rigidity of social norms in the Restoration-period French republic. ==Themes== Sand's main theme in the novel is marriage. Marriages of convenience are expected in the novel. Évariste de Lansac, Valentine's fiancé, is a greedy character who pursues marriage for land and wealth. However, while marriage between Valentine and Benedict would be based on genuine love, it is also forbidden by their class differences. The snobbery of the upper class is embodied by Valentine's grandmother. The novel depicts the limited education given to women in the 1830s. Having completed a basic education in preparation for her marriage, Valentine complains she is \\"miserable.\\" She is able to draw, sing, and dance, but does not have knowledge of the world beyond what would prepare her for a domestic life as a wife. Valentine's sister, Louise, represents a rebellious alternative. Louise becomes entangled romantically with Benedict. Benedict is then in love with both sisters. The novel offers no solutions for these social problems, but simply allows them to unfold. The novel's fictional backdrop is shared by many of Sand's later rustic novels, the Black Valley in the Berri region. These novels are based on the region where Sand had her own country estate. ==Reception== In the Revue de Romans, an 1839 reviewer of the novel noted Sand's unique use of the romance genre. \\"Valentine is the work of a woman author who depicts in this novel, and with unexpected vigor for this often- silly genre of writing, the trials and tribulations of a woman whom society has condemned to waste away her days in a place whether neither the people nor their ages are varied, and neither love nor affection are easily obtained; in short, it is a hyperbolic critique of the institution of marriage, but it is a charming work of great interest and poetry.\\" (Translated from the French, Source: http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Revue_des_Romans/George_Sand) ==References== Source text: * Valentine- Book in French * Valentine- Audiobook in French Review (in French) * An 1839 review of Valentine Literary criticism: * Aimée Boutin, Out of Place: Family Dysfunction and Displacement in Valentine, Romantic Review 96(3/4): 311–324.

Founded in 1938, The Society of Orpheus and Bacchus is the second longest-running a cappella group in the United States, after the Yale Whiffenpoofs. Alumni of the SOBs have gone on to be founding members of other college a cappella groups such as The Pitchforks of Duke University (Jeff Warren 1978) and The Chorallaries of MIT (David H. Bass 1975, also composer of their Engineer's Drinking Song). ==History== On October 31, 1938, twelve Yale undergraduates gathered at Mory's Temple Bar to form an alternative a cappella group to the Yale Whiffenpoofs. The group capitalized on a back-handed compliment received from an audience member: \\"These SOBs are good!\\" and formed a backronym. ==Music and comedy== Custom necktie, reads \\"Designed Exclusively for the Society of Orpheus & Bacchus\\" The society’s repertoire, which contains over 200 arrangements, is composed entirely of music arranged by current and former members of the group during its more than seven decades of existence. It spans a variety of genres from barbershop to jazz to songs by more contemporary artists like Queen, MIKA, Radiohead, Ariana Grande, Tenacious D, Kanye West and Michael Bublé. In addition to singing, the group prides itself on its comedy, with a typical concert including shtick written by members of the group. Each year, the Society of Orpheus and Bacchus performs across the USA and around the world, typically wearing tuxedos or suits with custom group neckties. They have performed at the White House, La Fortaleza in Puerto Rico, the American Airlines Arena for the NBA team the Miami Heat, as well as at country clubs, yacht clubs, churches, schools and resorts. The SOBs are one of only three groups — along with the Whiffenpoofs and Whim 'n Rhythm — that have a weekly engagement at Mory's Temple Bar. ==Discography== The Society of Orpheus and Bacchus records a new album every other year.

It was written by poet and lyricist Hachiro Sato and composer Tadashi Manjome, who was also the producer of the film. The song was sung as a duet between the Japanese actress Michiko Namiki and the singer Noboru Kirishima and released on recording January 1946. It is considered the first hit song in Japan after World War II. was released on October 11, 1945, and was the first movie produced after World War II in Japan. It was a commercial success, but was severely criticized by movie critics. As autumn advanced, the song Ringo no Uta from the movie spread in popularity, becoming more famous than the film's theme song, Soyokaze. Ringo no Uta was broadcast on a radio for the first time on December 10, 1945, and the 78rpm record was released by Nippon Colombia in January 1946. Sato's lyrics expressed a girl's feeling in a red apple, one which matched the feelings of freedom after the war. The record recorded unprecedented sales which exceed 100,000 copies. == Background == The history of Ringo no Uta has the twists and turns. Soyokaze is a happy movie featured songs and love. However, originally the film script was written in order to whip up Japanese people's fighting spirit in wartime. Of course, Ringo no Uta was also made as a war song with the same intention, but did not pass the censorship by the then Japanese military authorities. Lyricist Hachiro Sato intended to write a bright military march, but the military authorities reached the conclusion that the song was too soft music under the wartime. However, the situation changed completely when the war was over on August 15, 1945. The plan to produce the first postwar film started just two weeks later in order to relieve and encourage the Japanese who were in poverty and suffered from the blow of defeat. Soyokaze was chosen as the object of the plan and the production of Ringo no Uta was also resumed. Composer Tadashi Manjome who was the producer of the movie Soyokaze discussed with Sato and changed words in wartime into the present words. Michiko Namiki was appointed as the leading role on Manjome and Sato's recommendation. Manjome and Sato advised Namiki to sing more brightly, but Namiki could not readily bring herself to sing so because she lost her parents and elder brother and lover in war. She continued worrying about that for a while. But, it recorded the unprecedented hit as a hopeful song by her bright voice, and contributed greatly to the revival of the postwar Japanese culture. == References  External links == * Michiko Namiki discography (Nippon Columbia) Category:1946 songs Category:Japanese- language songs Category:Japanese film songs ","title":"Ringo no Uta (1946 song)"},{"id":"35851391","text":"Snape Marshes is a 19.8 hectare nature reserve south-east of Snape in Suffolk.

In addition to being used as a pharmaceutical drug itself, levomethadone is the main therapeutic component of methadone. Where it is used, levomethadone is used for narcotic maintenance in place of, or in some cases alongside as an alternative, to racemic methadone, owing to concern about the cardiotoxic and QT-prolonging action of racemic methadone being exclusively caused by the dextrorotatory enantiomer, dextromethadone. ==PharmacologyPharmacodynamics=== Levomethadone has approximately 50x the potency of the S-(+)-enantiomer as well as greater μ-opioid receptor selectivity. Accordingly, it is about twice as potent as methadone by weight and its effects are virtually identical in comparison. In addition to its activity at the opioid receptors, levomethadone has been found to act as a weak competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex and as a potent noncompetitive antagonist of the α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor. ==Chemistry== The separation of the stereoisomers is one of the easier in organic chemistry and is described in the original patent.

The first game in the series, Monster Trucks Nitro was released on December 19, 2008 for the Flash, Windows and Mac OS X platforms and on March 27, 2009 for the iOS platform. A sequel, entitled Monster Trucks Nitro 2, was released on April 5, 2010 exclusively for the iOS platform. The game is played by controlling the throttle, brake and pitch of a monster truck as they proceed through a level. The original Nitro received mixed reviews from critics. The PC version holds a 54% score at aggregate website GameRankings. Monster Trucks Nitro 2 received higher scores in general, and currently has an aggregate score of 80/100 at Metacritic. ==Gameplay== In the Monster Trucks Nitro series players must guide a monster truck along a two-dimensional path as quickly as possible. The Monster Trucks Nitro series is played as a sidescrolling racing game. Players have control over the monster truck's acceleration and brakes and have can also control the vehicle's pitch while in the air. A limited amount of pitch control is given to the player while on a surface, augmented by accelerating or braking. The Nitro part of the series' title comes from the game's focus on earning nitrous by either collecting bottles or performing flips while in the air. Depending on the game version the nitrous either fires immediately or charges, waiting for the player to press the nitrous button. In either case it provides a speed boost for the truck. Gameplay varies slightly depending on the platform and game played. On iOS devices both Monster Trucks Nitro and its sequel are played using on- screen touch controls in combination with tilting the device. The original Monster Trucks Nitro is played using the keyboard on the Flash, Windows and Mac OS X platforms. The Flash version is also unique in that it does not use a 3D engine, but rather a 2D version similar to RedLynx's original Trials game. ==Development and marketing== The original Monster Trucks Nitro game was released on December 19, 2008 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It was released for iOS devices on March 23, 2009. On July 5, 2010 an update was released which added additional content. A new monster truck with a paint scheme resembling the American flag was added, along with additional races. In the press release that announced the update RedLynx stated that the game had received over 1.5 million downloads. Monster Trucks Nitro 2 was announced on March 26, 2010.

Born in Bloomington, Minnesota, he was the first pilot hired by Northwest Airways in 1926. In 1928, Holman set a world's record of 1,433 consecutive loops in an airplane in five hours over the St. Paul Airport.(nd) Ask A Historian . Ramsey County Historical Society. Retrieved 5/31/07. ==Biography== He was born in Bloomington, Minnesota on December 27, 1898. In 1917 Holman raced motorcycles at the Minnesota State Fair, earning the nickname \\"Slim\\", and later, \\"Speed\\". In 1918, Holman offered to work as a mechanic in exchange for flying lessons with Walter Bullock. To earn money, he quickly added parachute jumps and wingwalking to his skills. In 1924 Holman won second place in the \\"on to Dayton\\" race. In 1926 he became an airmail pilot on the CAM-9 route from Minneapolis to Chicago, along with Matty Laird. In 1927 he won the New York to Spokane cross country air derby in a Laird commercial biplane. CAM-9 was reorganized by William Bushnell Stout with several financiers to form Northwest Airlines, hiring Holman as its first pilot, later becoming its chief pilot. Holman's first pilot's license, issued in 1927, was signed by Orville Wright. By 1929, Holman was a leading pilot for Northwest airlines, gaining more notoriety becoming the fourth person in the world to perform the outside loop, and first to do so in a commercial aircraft. Holman became a major investor in the airline, buying $2,000 worth of stock. In 1930 Matty Laird was commissioned to build a racing plane based on the Laird Speedwing by B.F. Goodrich's Lee Schoenhair for the 1930 Thompson Trophy race. Schoenhair backed out of the project, believing the aircraft would not be tested in time. Laird entered the Laird Solution with Holman as the pilot only a few minutes after Holman flew the aircraft on its maiden flight.

Gairdner was principally known for a number of research studies in neonatology at a time when that subject was being developed as perhaps the most rewarding application of basic physiology to patient care, and later his most important contributions as editor, firstly editing Recent Advances in Paediatrics and then of Archives of Disease in Childhood for 15 years, turning the latter into an international journal of repute with its exemplary standards of content and presentation. ==Early life== Gairdner, the son of William Henry Temple Gairdner, an Anglican missionary, and grandson of Sir William Tennant Gairdner, KCB, a medical doctor and professor, was born in Scotland on 19 November 1910. His mother was Mary Mitchell. He was the great-nephew of historian James Gairdner. Gairdner was named for his father's late friend, Douglas M. Thornton who had died three years before Gairdner's birth. Gairdner had four siblings. His very early life was spent in Egypt where his father was a missionary. Gairdner's father died in 1928, when Gairdner was 17 years of age. Gairdner attended Kelvinside Academy, Glasgow Dragon School, Oxford; and Gresham's School, Holt. He went to school with W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten and sang madrigals with classmate Peter Pears. He read chemistry at the University of Oxford but switched to medicine, did clinical training at Middlesex Hospital and was awarded his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery Degree in 1936. He did his residency (house physician) in paediatrics at The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street in Bloomsbury, London in 1937-8. Gairdner described his experience there in a memoir written a half- century later. He wrote, \\"I recall the sheer enjoyment of working there, but also the periods of overwhelming exhaustion.\\" ==Professional career== Gairdner worked as a fellow in paediatrics at Bellevue Hospital in 1939. During the Second World War, served in the Royal Army Medical Corps for five years, retiring with the rank of Major. He became first assistant in the paediatric department at Newcastle where he began to work under Professor Sir James Calvert Spence in 1945. In 1948, he became a consultant paediatrician at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and associate lecturer in paediatrics at the University of Cambridge, where he remained until his retirement in 1975. His obituary in the British Medical Journal described Gairdner as \\"an outstanding figure in the development of British Paediatrics after the second world war\\". His statistics from the special care baby unit were \\"invaluable in monitoring trends in perinatal mortality and morbidity since 1950.\\" He constantly produced important research over a range of topics and he improved the management of respiratory problems in the newborn. He was appointed editor of the Archives of Disease in Childhood in 1964, a position he held for 15 years, until his retirement in 1979. During that time the journal \\"steadlily increased in size, scientific content, and international reputation.\\" Gairdner's 1949 article, The Fate of the Foreskin: A Study of Circumcision, was described as \\"a model of perceptive and pungent writing.\\" It concluded that if circumcision became uncommon it would result in \\"the saving of about 16 children's lives lost from circumcision each year in this country...\\" According to Wallerstein, the article \\"began to affect the practice of circumcision by the British\\". Gairdner was pleased with the success of the article. Gairdner also opposed unnecessary tonsillectomy, drawing attention to the risks of the operation at the time (1951) and suggested more conservative ways of treating repeated respiratory infections. Gairdner served as editor of Recent Advances in Paediatrics, an annual book publication, for several years from 1954. Gairdner's research interests included Schōnlein-Henoch purpura, nephrotic syndrome, circumcision, and the formation of red blood cells in infancy. He made contributions to the field of neonatology with studies on improving the management of respiratory problems of the newborn. PubMed lists sixty-one published papers by Dr Gairdner. ==Honours== The James Spence Medal of the British Paediatric Association was awarded to Gairdner in 1976. He received the Dawson Williams Prize of the British Medical Association in 1978 for his creative editing of the Archives of Disease in Childhood. Gairdner vacationed several times in Portugal as guest of the Portuguese Academy of Paediatrics where he won the respect of the local paediatricians who called him \\"the best paediatric ambassador who ever came to Portugal.\\" ==Personal life== Gairdner lived in a detached house on Rutherford Road in Cambridge. Gairdner and his wife, Nancy, had four girls. The youngest was killed in a road accident. Gairdner was a talented musician who played the ukulele, the flute, and the tuba. He was a member of the Royston Town Band, a brass band that plays in and around the city of Royston, Hertfordshire (about 13 miles south-west of Cambridge).Royston Brass Band He also was a sailor and kept a boat named the \\"Merry Thought\\". Gairdner loved to read and told of his wide- ranging interests in an article published by the British Medical Journal. He was described as a man with a strong sense of social responsibility who took politics seriously and a radical by temperament who \\"found it difficult to combine his feel for tradition with the need for change.\\" ==Death== Gairdner died on 10 May 1992 at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, Nancy, three daughters, and five grandchildren. ==See also== * William Tennant Gairdner * William Henry Temple Gairdner * History of male circumcision * Circumcision controversies ==References== *Douglas Gairdner (obituary), The Times, London, 13 May 1992, page 15 Category:1910 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge Category:British editors Category:British medical researchers Category:20th-century English medical doctors Category:British paediatricians Category:People educated at Kelvinside Academy Category:People educated at Gresham's School Category:People educated at The Dragon School Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Recipients of the James Spence Medal ","title":"Douglas Gairdner"},{"id":"35851712","text":"Francis van Bossuit (detail of a commemorative engraving by Matthys Pool after a portrait by Barent Graat) Francis van Bossuit (1635, Brussels - 1692, Amsterdam), was a Flemish sculptor, working mostly in terracotta, wood, and ivory.Francis van Bossuit in the RKD ==Biography== According to the RKD, he traveled to Rome and joined the Bentvueghels with the nickname \\"Waarnemer\\" (meaning delegate, observer, or reporter). He worked with Barent Graat and Matthys Pool and consorted with Florentine academy students. He travelled back north around 1680 with the painter Bonaventura van Overbeke. He is known for ivory and wood sculptures, and his motifes became popular and are found in the works of other contemporary artists such as Jan van Mieris and Willem van Mieris, Ignatius van Logteren, Barend Graat, and Nicolaas Verkolje. Roeland van Eynden and Adriaan van der Willigen, in their Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst, write that he was given the title \\"Waarnemer\\" by his Schildersbent friends in Rome due to his precise observations of the classic statues there. Equipped with the skills to create poetic sculptures, he returned north with Bonaventura van Overbeek, and became an internationally recognized artist due to the unusual tenderness of his ivory sculptures of the classics.Biography of Francis van Bossuit in Roeland van Eynden and Adriaan van der Willigen's Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst, 1840, Vol. I, p. 150 (reprint 1979) His international fame was probably mostly due to the educational book published in 1727 by Matthys Pool called Cabinet de l'Art de Sculpture, with engravings after drawings of his works that illustrated stories from Ovid and other classics.

Plume hunting is the hunting of wild birds to harvest their feathers, especially the more decorative plumes which were sold for use as ornamentation, such as aigrettes in millinery. The movement against the plume trade in the United Kingdom was led by Etta Lemon and other women and led to the establishment of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The plume trade was at its height in the late 19th and was brought to an end in the early 20th century. By the late 19th century, plume hunters had nearly wiped out the snowy egret population of the United States. Flamingoes, roseate spoonbills, great egrets and peafowl have also been targeted by plume hunters. The Empress of Germany's bird of paradise was also a popular target of plume hunters. Victorian era fashion included large hats with wide brims decorated in elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and exotic plumes. Hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Plumage often came from birds in the Florida everglades, some of which were nearly extinguished by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists such as Adeline Knapp were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds were being killed every year, including 95 percent of Florida's shore birds. In Hawaii, Kāhili are feather standards worn by the chiefly class. Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) did not hunt and kill the birds. Native American war bonnets and various feather headdresses also feature feathers. ==Hunt for plumes== Early 20th century illustration of plume types At the turn of the 20th century, thousands of birds were being killed in order to provide feathers to decorate women's hats. The fashion craze, which began in the 1870s, became so widespread that by 1886 birds were being killed for the millinery trade at a rate of five million a year; many species faced extinction as a result.McIver, p. xiii. In Florida, plume birds were first driven away from the most populated areas in the northern part of the state, and forced to nest further south. Rookeries concentrated in and around the Everglades area, which had abundant food and seasonal dry periods, ideal for nesting birds. By the late 1880s, there were no longer any large numbers of plume birds within reach of Florida's most settled cities.McIver, p. 46. The most popular plumes came from various species of egret, known as \\"little snowies\\" for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the \\"nuptial plumes\\", grown during the mating season and displayed by birds during courtship.Shearer, p. 36. So-called \\"osprey\\" plumes, actually egret plumes, were used as part of British army uniforms until they were discontinued in 1889. Poachers often entered the densely populated rookeries, where they would shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot. Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure. One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, \\"The heads and necks of the young birds were hanging out of the nests by the hundreds. I am done with bird hunting forever!\\"Huffstodt, pp. 42-43. Egrets, including the great egret, were decimated in the past by plume hunters, but numbers recovered when given protection in the 20th century.Hammerson, Geoffrey A., Connecticut Wildlife: Biodiversity, Natural History, and Conservation, University Press of New England: Hanover, New Hampshire, and London, 2004, , Chapter 20 \\"Birds\\" In 1886, 5 million birds were estimated to be killed for their feathers.Grunwald, p. 120. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915 — which was also the price of gold then.McCally, p. 117. Millinery was a $17 million a year industryDouglas, p. 310. that motivated plume harvesters to lay in wait at the nests of egrets and other birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades water birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.McCally, pp. 117–118. ==Guy Bradley== In 1885, 15-year-old Guy Bradley and his older brother Louis served as scouts for noted French plume hunter Jean Chevalier on his trip to the Everglades.Tebeau, p. 75. Accompanied by their friend Charlie Pierce, the men set sail on Pierce's craft, the Bonton, ending their journey in Key West. At the time, plume feathers--selling for more than $20 an ounce ($ in 2011)--were reportedly more valuable per weight than gold.McIver, p. 16. On their expedition, which lasted several weeks, the young men and Chevalier's party killed 1,397 birds of 36 species.McIver, p. 29. Bradley eventually became a warden protecting birds from the plume hunting trade. ==Conservation== A great egret family; plume birds were often shot while sitting on their nests. In Florida, in an effort to control plume hunting, the American Ornithologists Union and the National Association of Audubon Societies (now the National Audubon Society) persuaded the Florida State Legislature to pass a model non- game bird protection law in 1901. These organizations then employed wardens to protect rookeries, in effect establishing colonial bird sanctuaries. Pelican Island NWR Such public concern, combined with the conservation-minded President Theodore Roosevelt, led to his executive order of President on March 14, 1903, established Pelican Island as the first national wildlife refuge in the United States to protect egrets and other birds from extinction by plume hunters. This resulted in the initial federal land specifically set aside for a non-marketable form of wildlife (the brown pelican) when Pelican Island was proclaimed a Federal Bird Reservation in 1903. Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge is said to be the first bona fide \\"refuge\\". The first warden employed by the government at Pelican Island, Paul Kroegel, was an Audubon warden whose salary was $1 a month. Plume hunter guide turned game warden Guy Bradley was shot and killed after confronting plume hunters.\\"Everglades Biographies: Guy Bradley\\". Everglades Digital Library. Retrieved on July 1, 2010. Following the modest trend begun with Pelican Island, many other islands and parcels of land and water were quickly dedicated for the protection of various species of colonial nesting birds that were being destroyed for their plumes and other feathers. Such refuge areas included Breton National Wildlife Refuge in Breton, Louisiana (1904), Passage Key National Wildlife Refuge in Passage Key, Florida (1905), Shell Keys National Wildlife Refuge in Shell Keys, Louisiana (1907), and Key West National Wildlife Refuge in Key West, Florida (1908). ==Bird City== Bird City is a private wildfowl refuge or bird sanctuary located on Avery Island in coastal Iberia Parish, Louisiana, founded by Tabasco sauce heir and conservationist Edward Avery McIlhenny, whose family owned Avery Island. McIlhenny established the refuge around 1895 on his own personal tract of the island, a estate known eventually as Jungle Gardens because of its lush tropical flora in response to late 19th century plume hunters nearly wiping out the snowy egret population of the United States while in pursuit of the bird's delicate feathers. McIlhenny searched the Gulf Coast and located several surviving egrets, which he took back to his estate on Avery Island. There he turned the birds loose in a type of aviary he called a \\"flying cage,\\" where the birds soon adapted to their new surroundings. In the fall McIlhenny set the birds loose to migrate south for the winter. As he hoped, the birds returned to Avery Island in the spring, bringing with them even more snowy egrets. This pattern continued until, by 1911, the refuge served as the summer nesting ground for an estimated 100,000 egrets.Edward Avery McIlhenny, Bird City (Boston: Christopher Publishing House, 1935), passim. Because of its early founding and example to others, Theodore Roosevelt, father of American conservationism, once referred to Bird City as \\"the most noteworthy reserve in the country.\\"Theodore, Roosevelt, \\"Bird Reserves at the Mouth of the Mississippi River,\\" A Book-Lover’s Holidays in the Open (1916), n.p. Today, snowy egrets continue to return to Bird City each spring to nest until resuming their migration in the fall. ==Empress of Germany's bird of paradise and captive breeding== The Empress of Germany's bird of paradise was one of the most heavily hunted birds of paradise in the plume-hunting era, and was the first bird of paradise to breed in captivity. It was bred and observed by Prince R.S. Dharmakumarsinhji of India in 1940. ==ReferencesSources== *Douglas, Marjory (1947).

Ujamaa Place took over some of the services a previous program, Awali Place offered, when Awali lost its funding due to 2009 budget cuts. Ujamaa Place received its non-profit status in 2010. ==History== In 2009, a group of leaders in the St. Paul African-American community, including the St. Paul Chief of Police John Harrington, Executive Director of the St. Paul YWCA Billy Collins, St. Paul City Council Member Melvin Carter III, Thad Wilderson, Mary K. Boyd, the NAACP, and several members of the Black Ministerial Alliance and the Council on Black Minnesotans, identified that there was a significant gap in social welfare delivery system and programming for this population in Saint Paul, which needed immediate attention. The organizers realized that without intervention from a program like Ujamaa Place, this would be a “lost generation” of young men who die at a young age or are incarcerated for most of their lives. A similar program to Ujamaa Place was developed by Twin Cities RISE! (TCR!) and piloted in St. Paul in 2008 and part of 2009. In 2009, TCR! determined that the program (Awali Place) would be part of a budget reduction since it was not closely aligned with their core mission. A group of concerned citizens (several of whom are mentioned above) decided to work together to establish Ujamaa Place to further develop the program and build on the good work conducted within the Awali Place program. Ujamaa Place received 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in April 2010, and opened its doors at 1885 University Avenue in St. Paul in November 2010. ==Program== Ujamaa Place programming is made available at no cost to participants, but it is a program that demands mutual accountability. It helps men develop the skills it takes to be a successful individual, father, employee, and citizen. Trained coaches develop high- context relationships that are individualized for each participant, rather than applying a prescribed approach to all. Coaches have often overcome similar obstacles in their own lives, providing inspiration and models of empowerment for participants. To graduate from the program, an Ujamaa Place participant must demonstrate job skills, empowerment skills and life skills through the following: *Completion of his GED *Demonstrated use of Empowerment Skills in his daily life *Remained drug-free *No recent criminal offenses *Secured stable housing *Held a job for a minimum of three months Ujamaa Place is not a holding place, but a place of new beginnings and transition. Graduates continue to successfully hold jobs and are enrolled in job training programs in which they gain the skills necessary to secure high skill jobs with benefits. ==Board of directors== *Mary K.

They served as a farm team of the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche and the American Hockey League's Lake Erie Monsters. Based in Denver, Colorado, the Cutthroats played their home games at the Denver Coliseum. On August 20, 2014, after only two seasons in the CHL, the Cutthroats announced they would go dormant for the 2014–15 season, with hopes to gain additional investors for 2015–16. Besides sharing the city/market with their parent club the Avalanche, the Cutthroats were the fifth hockey team to play at the Denver Coliseum, after the original International Hockey League's Denver Mavericks (1958–59), the original Western Hockey League's Denver Invaders (1963–64), the Denver Spurs of the WHL (and later the original Central Hockey League) (1968–75), and finally the IHL's Denver Rangers (1987–89). ==History== Reports of a CHL team playing at the Coliseum for 2012-13 came as early as February, with initial reports stating they would be named the Denver Grizzlies, after the city's most recent IHL franchise which won the Turner Cup in its only season in the city and is widely credited for garnering enough interest to entice the Quebec Nordiques to relocate to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche. However, once the team was officially announced on April 10, 2012, it was confirmed the team would not go by the \\"Denver Grizzlies\\" name because of unspecified copyright issues (likely related to the Utah Grizzlies ownership of said name). Although the team had registered the \\"Denver Cutthroats\\" name with the city and the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the name was still not officially announced, with the team holding a \\"Guess the Name\\" contest in the meantime. On May 17, 2012, the Cutthroats officially announced their name, logo, and color scheme. With the addition of the Cutthroats, the CHL aligned to the one Berry Conference. The Cutthroats opened the season in Denver against the Missouri Mavericks on October 19, marking the first hockey game in the Coliseum since 1989. The Cutthroats' first season saw them skate to 30 wins, and the 8th seed in the 2013 Ray Miron's President's Cup Playoffs. They faced the top seeded (and eventual CHL champions) Allen Americans, and, after taking game 1, the Cutthroats lost 4 straight to lose the series 4-1. In the following 2013–14 season, a vastly improved Cutthroats team, with the help of CHL MVP Garett Bembridge, recorded 38 wins, and the 2nd seed in the Ray Miron's President's Cup Playoffs. The Cutthroats won their first playoff series in team history, defeating the Tulsa Oilers in 6 games before advancing to the finals after a 4-1 series win over the Arizona Sundogs. This marked the Cutthroats' first berth in the Ray Miron Cup Final in only their second year of existence. In the final, the Cutthroats once more faced the defending champions in the Allen Americans who had dispatched them a year earlier. After taking game 1, the Cutthroats again lost 4 straight games, allowing Allen to win back-to-back championships. After months of rumors, and speculation, on August 20, 2014, the Denver Cutthroats announced an immediate suspension of operations and elected for dormancy for the 2014–15 season. All players of the Cutthroats were rendered free agents, however the Cutthroats planned to seek additional investors to re-join the league for the 2015–16 season, an ambition made moot by the league itself folding a few months later. ==Staff== The Cutthroats were owned by Boulder resident John Hayes, CEO of Broomfield-based Ball Corp.. Former NHL player Derek Armstrong served as the Cutthroats' first head coach; although his NHL career had him playing for the New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, New York Rangers, Los Angeles Kings and St. Louis Blues, he is best remembered in Denver for being a member of the Grizzlies' 1994-95 Turner Cup run. After their inaugural season, Armstrong was joined by former teammate and Cutthroat Brad Smyth as an assistant coach and assistant of hockey operations. ==Season-by-season resultsRegular season=== {   - !Season!!

The story tells of the love of the outcast chandala Prakriti for the monk Ānanda. Although both are ostracised by the other monks, Buddha permits their chaste union, and allows Prakriti to join the monastic community.Wagner (1995), 385-6 Writing to Marie Sayn-Wittgenstein in 1857, Wagner refers to the girl as 'Savitri' and suggests a three-act structure.Wagner (1987). 365-6.

At Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, serandite occurs in sodalite xenoliths and pegmatites cutting syenites within an intrusive alkalic gabbro- syenite complex. In Point of Rocks, New Mexico, it occurs in vugs in phonolite. At the Tumannoe deposit in Russia, serandite occurs in a manganese rich deposit associated with volcanic rocks and terrigenous (non-marine) sediments which has been altered by contact metamorphism. Serandite has been found in association with aegirine, analcime, arfvedsonite, astrophyllite, eudialyte, fluorite, leucophanite, mangan-neptunite, microcline, nepheline, sodalite, and villiaumite. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== Category:Triclinic minerals Category:Sodium minerals Category:Manganese(II) minerals Category:Calcium minerals Category:Hydroxide minerals Category:Inosilicates Category:Gemstones ","title":"Serandite"},{"id":"35852019","text":"Ferenc Wekler (born October 23, 1955) is a Hungarian politician, who served as one of the Deputy Speakers of the National Assembly of Hungary from June 18, 1998 to September 15, 2004.

Despite its proud Police history, very few current players are members of the Bermuda Police Service. ==History== The Barbarians were the first to break away from the B.A.A. (Bermuda Athletic Association). This was in 1954 when a number of policemen and some of their friends decided to form their own team. The better Police players were already playing for the B.A.A. at this time, but they joined their brothers in this new venture which strengthened them considerably, and therefore made them a viable entity. After four years the team officially became the Police Recreation Club's Rugby Football Section, alias \\"THE POLICE\\", or B.P.R.F.C., which it still is today. In 1959 (against the very strong recommendations of the chief superintendent) the Government of Bermuda, decided to move the police headquarters from the centre of activity in Hamilton to the then recently vacated military complex at Prospect. At the same time the Police Club was also moved there as well. The Bermuda Police Rugby Football Club (B.P.R.F.C.) came into being on Monday, 7 September 1959. The first chairman of the B.P.R.F.C. was the police commissioner at that time Mr. R.G. Henderson, a strong supporter of the game and a former Scottish International. He played against both England and Ireland in 1924, and was a member of the British party that toured Africa in that same year. The first game played by the B.P.R.F.C. was against H.M.S. Troubridge, on Wednesday 4 November 1959. The Police won handsomely 35–0, with Peter Stubbs (who would go on to be a chairman of the club) taking the place of Dave Lunn Sr, and ending up kicking the first conversion of the day. The first captain of the B.P.R.F.C. was a non-police officer, Mr. Paul Rich, a member of Her Majesty's Armed Forces left behind in Bermuda to tidy up the final details of over 180 years of Garrison duty. He was a most popular choice, and his skills on the rugby field, where he played at standoff, were matched only by his ability to get the best out of his players. In 1960, Dave Lunn Sr persuaded the club to adopt the \\"Police Blue\\" which is still worn to this day. Prior to that time, the police officers and the associate members of the club had been wearing the black strip of the \\"Barbarians\\" Rugby Club, whose short history has never been officially recorded. They played out of the old Police Barracks on Victoria Street, where the City Hall car-park stands today, and used the former Army Garrison Field at Prospect, which has now made way for the National Stadium. In the same year Mr. John Logan (a former Hon. Secretary and Club Stalwart, whose many recorded minutes and reports make up a lot of what you are reading now), negotiated the club's affiliation to Twickenham (the R.F.U.), as he had done four years earlier in relation to the Bermuda Rugby Association. The club's affiliation came into effect on 1 September 1962. In 1961 the club began 2nd XV Rugby, mainly against the many British Royal Navy ships patrolling the area at the time. In the very beginning the B.P.R.F.C. did not do much better than the Barbarians before them, winning some while losing more, but gradually they began to acquire more and more better players. The B.P.R.F.C. won the Robin Hood Trophy and the John White League Trophy. Consequently, the B.P.R.F.C. has developed into possibly the strongest of the four local clubs on the island, winning numerous League and Cup Honours on a regular basis over the last 40 years. Its most notable season (until 2013 / 14) was in the 1989/90 when the B.P.R.F.C. 1st XV became the first and only team to win the coveted Grand Slam of all that season's trophies. The club also honours the memory of one of its most enthusiastic supporters and a former police commissioner, Mr. George Duckett O.B.E., who was assassinated whilst serving as the head of the Force, along with the governor of the Island in the 1972 riots. A memorial game has been played in his name every year since his death. For past few years, this game has been played back up on the new Police Field, where an enormous amount of work goes into transforming this ground from Soccer/Cricket pitch into a Rugby pitch for this one-off event. The B.P.R.F.C. in the past have played at Prospect, where they used to play at the Old Army Garrison Field, which was given to them to share with the other sporting groups from the Police Recreation Club. But when the Government decided it would turn half of the Prospect buildings into schools, it was not long before the education department were casting envious eyes on the playing field. Sure enough, within a couple of years of the euphoria of the club eventually getting its own field, this field was gone altogether. Although the players and other club members were disappointed at this reversal, it wasn't a major catastrophe as far as they were concerned. That was until they went to retrieve their goalposts only to find them gone. Four 35-foot-long tapered wooden poles painted royal blue and white, don't just pick up their -foot crossbars and walk away ... But these ones did! The make-up of B.P.R.F.C. players has changed dramatically; without an influx of players coming from within the Police Service. Around the mid 1990s, the Bermuda Government put a stop to the practice of bringing in expatriate police officers, so the need to find players from other sources was ever more apparent. This proved to be a very demanding cause and still does to this day. But, as always, the B.P.R.F.C. seems to cope well with all matters thrown in its path. After the initial downside it now seems to be rectifying itself with chefs, accountants, brokers and even students making up a lot of the players these days. The 1997/98 season, for instance, saw for the first time a B.P.R.F.C. 1st XV take to the field without a single police officer on the team sheet. Despite this fact the club today continues to have a healthy Blue Vein running right through it. In October 2005 the idea was first floated of forming a ladies section in the B.P.R.F.C. in order to provide competition for the women's squads that the Renegades and Mariners clubs were training. The ladies first started training with Ryan \\"Kermit\\" Sommerville as coach – lovingly nicknamed \\"The Couch\\" by the Ladies with Jennifer Baird appointed as the first Ladies Captain. Their first league game was a 2–1 win over the Renegades at the Malabar field in December 2005. The ladies touch league was thus established and after Christmas 2005, regular league games were played alongside the men's fixtures. The 2005/06 season has been the only season so far that the ladies fielded a serving police officer (Denise Downey) on the roster. She retired after a short but eventful career, but the ladies are hoping that more serving women police officers will join in the future! The first ladies game at the Duckett Memorial was held in January 2006 and the ladies trophy for this contest was named after \\"Roseanda Young\\" – the Deputy Police Commissioner at the time and the first lady to hold such a high post in the Bermuda Police Service. The B.P.R.F.C Ladies team won this inaugural game. Over the last few seasons, the ladies league has seen a change from touch to flag rugby and back to touch again. The women's game is growing rapidly in Bermuda. The B.P.R.F.C. Ladies have had 6 members selected to play with the Bermuda women's contact squad in 2009. The B.P.R.F.C. men's section has toured extensively and rather enthusiastically at times since its inception, including a touring party to Toronto, Ontario in May 1999 for a game against its colleagues the Toronto Metropolitan Police (The Wild Boar's RFC) for our 40th Anniversary. The tour destination in May 2008 was to Costa Rica, where they played against a Costa Rican national select side, defeating them 31–20. The tour was a great success with 28 tourists attending – a blend of club veterans and rookies ranging in age from the esteemed tour veteran and retired police officer, John Williams (Age undisclosed!) to tour rookie, Reserve Police Officer Gregory White (Age 23). In 2009 they toured the Dominican Republic and once again played the national team; successfully defeating them 20–0. In 2010 the B.P.R.F.C toured Austin in Texas, playing the Austin Huns RFC \\"Silverbacks\\" team and completing a hat-trick of tour wins with a 35–5 victory. The 2010/11 season is the 51st for the B.P.R.F.C. and for the first time since the 1998/99 season, the B.P.R.F.C. 1st XV has won the BRFU League. In 2011 the BPRFC continued their winning streak with a win against Memphis RFC In 2013 the BPRFC were honoured to travel and play Key West RFC. The touring party was 22 strong and had a great victory whilst having a 'fun filled' tour. The 2013/2014 season was another to savour. The Police Men's team won the Bermuda ’Grand Slam’ for the 1st time since 1991! Winning the league and Cup double along with the Duckett Memorial, Marsden Memorial and 7s Cup. The women's team also won the league with a near unbeaten season. During September to October 2018 the BPRFC won the 7s cup, 10s cup and the Mad Hatters tournament prior to the commencement of the 2018/19 season. ==Internationally capped players== * Sean FIELD-LAMENT* * Alan GORBUTT* * Gareth DAVIES* * David BIRD* * Alan OLIVER* * Tom GALLAGHER * Bill BUTTERWORTH* * Maurice PETT* * Ryan SOMMERVILLE * Keith CASSIDY* * Jonathan CASSIDY * Richard (Billy) Tempest-Mitchell• * Andrea BATTISTON * Flt Lt Benjamin BEASLEY (later Major)* * Darren RICHARDSON * Tom EDWARDS * Neville ZUILL * David PRINGLE * Dan COLE* * Paull DAVIS * Paul CANFIELD* * Adam RICHARDS * Patrick GRAHAM * Nigel BURGESS * Ryan MURRAY *Denotes Police or Former Police Officer == BPRFC members 'capped' for outstanding services to the club for an extended period of time == In the mid 1990s, the BPRFC Executive decided that members of the BPRFC who had served the club honourably for an extended period of time would be honoured with a \\"cap\\".

Custance (1910–1985) was a Canadian physiologist and writer, best known for his advocation of gap creationism. ==Early life and career== Custance was born in Norfolk, England. He received his early education there and moved to Canada at age 19. He attended the University of Toronto where he obtained B.A. and M.A. degrees in biblical languages.Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design. Harvard University Press. p. 271. . He also became a Christian during this time. Custance obtained a Ph.D. in education from the University of Ottawa, which has been incorrectly cited in creationist literature as a Ph.D. in anthropology or physiology.Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design. Harvard University Press. p. 417. . Between 1957 and 1972 he wrote the ten volume \\"Doorway Papers\\" that attempt to bridge the gap between a scientific and a Christian worldview. In his scientific career, Custance \\"developed and designed respirator mask, mask- sizing meter, anthropometric facial contour measuring device. and the Custance Sudorimeter for accurate measurement of levels of heat stress\\". (see http://custance.org) He also wrote Without Form and Void (1970), an in-depth treatment of Gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989). Creationism: Intellectual Origins, Cultural Context, and Theoretical Diversity. University of California, Los Angeles. An expert on the most ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek versions of the bible, he concluded that the opening lines of the English version of Genesis should be translated as \\"In a former state God perfected the heavens and the earth; but the earth had become a devastated ruin.\\" === Seed of the Woman === Writing on the virgin birth, The Seed of the Woman, Custance explains the necessity of the virgin birth for the Messiah to be sinless. Custance asserts that the sin nature or the propensity to sin (in Hebraic writings the yetzer hara) is passed through the male line genetically, starting from the first Adam, thus allowing a full human genetic complement through Mary. This understanding of male transmission of the sin nature is one alternative to two other theories that consider the virgin birth as intrinsically connected to the sinless nature of the Messiah, necessary for the atoning sacrifice. One is the Roman Catholic conception of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Another has the virgin birth as a divine implantation in which Mary did not contribute genetically. The viewpoint expounded by Custance is popular in Christian evangelical circles, although usually given without the type of in depth exposition supplied by Custance. Apologist Matt Slick of CARM expresses this position in Why wasn't Jesus born with original sin?. Robert L. and Charles W. Asbell studied directly with Arthur Custance and write of these ideas in Scripture Research Vol 4, No 5, 2007. Charles Spurgeon, in writing \\"He is born of a woman, that he might be human; but not by man, that he might not be sinful.\\" in \\"A Popular Exposition to the Gospel According to Matthew\\" is essentially expounding a short summary of this understanding. There are additional theories that only look at the virgin birth as historically, but not intrinsically, significant to the question of the sinless Messiah. Those theories can see the virgin birth as related to incarnational or Biblical terminology, such as the Son of God, without directly being causal to the sinless nature of the Messiah. Lambert Dolphin summarizes the Custance view from an evangelical perspective in The Seed of the Serpent : :Some years ago, a Canadian scholar, Arthur Custance, suggested the possibility that \\"original sin\\" (which causes the death of the body, and our innate and total predisposition to sin)—is transmitted to the next generation through the male sperm, not through the female ovum ... Custance suggests that a child born to an ordinary woman, a descendant of Eve, could be a sinless child if her ovum were fertilized supernaturally. Thus he is suggesting a mechanism for the virgin birth of our Lord Jesus. Most scholars consider that the phrase the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15 does refer to the virgin birth of Jesus as the Redeemer and Savior of our race. In fact verse 15 is often called \\"the protevangelium,\\" or first announcement of the gospel. == Works == * \\"Journey Out of Time\\" Doorway Papers, 1981 * Was Adam evolved or created?

It was discovered in 1907 in what is now Zambia and named for Percy Tarbutt. ==Description and habit== Tarbuttite is white, yellow, red, green, brown, or colorless; in transmitted light it is colorless. Traces of copper cause green coloring, while iron hydroxides cause the other colors. Colorless crystals tend to be transparent while colored specimens have varying degrees of transparency. The mineral occurs as equant to short prismatic crystals up to , in sheaf-like or saddle-shaped aggregates, or as crusts. Individual crystals are commonly rounded and striated. ==Structure== Zinc ions are surrounded by oxygen in a nearly perfect trigonal bipyramid and phosphate groups are tetrahedral. The crystal structure consists of zig-zag chains of Zn1 polyhedra linked by phosphate groups and pairs of Zn2 polyhedra. In each unit cell are two formula units of Zn2(PO4)(OH).Cocco, p. 321. ==History== Tarbuttite was discovered in 1907 in Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia, (now Kabwe, Zambia).Spencer, p. 1. The mineral was described from specimens in cellular limonite in the largest hill of the group, Kopje No. 2.Spencer, p. 2. In a cave discovered in Kopje No. 1 by boring a tunnel, tarbuttite was also found in association with hopeite as obscure crystals and crystals smaller than Spencer, p. 30. and as an encrustation on some bones.Spencer, p. 31. Several specimens of the mineral were collected by Percy Coventry Tarbutt, a director of the Broken Hill Exploration Company.Spencer, p. 22. In 1907, the name tarbuttite was proposed by L.J. Spencer in the journal Nature in honor of Tarbutt. When the International Mineralogical Association was founded, tarbuttite was grandfathered as a valid mineral species. ==Occurrence== Tarbuttite has been found in Algeria, Angola, Australia, Canada, China, Namibia, the United States, and Zambia. Tarbuttite forms as secondary mineral in oxidized zinc deposits. It has been found in association with cerussite, descloizite, hemimorphite, hopeite, hydrozincite, \\"limonite\\", parahopeite, pyromorphite, scholzite, smithsonite, and vanadinite. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * *Palache, P.; Berman H.; Frondel, C.

The illicit offers were filmed by Willerton and other contestants, and were later uploaded to YouTube under the title \\"Confessions of a Beauty Queen\\". Subsequently, she and the contestants Aletha Shepherd of Guyana, and Pamela Peralta of Costa Rica, fled their hotel to the airport. The fleeing contestants claimed the pageant organizers tried to detain them against their will and followed them to the airport to keep them from escaping. The Korean National Police Agency and organizers denied all accusations. Willerton claimed that the organizers bribed the police officers, \\"When the police arrived they called in one of the chairmen of the pageant who actually got his wallet out straight away and we were all pushed back by the organizers so we couldn't speak...Our translator would not translate for us, so we were completely helpless.\\" In September 2014, the pageant organizer's registered office in Seoul was identified as a small room in a shared office space. May Myat Noe, the winner of the 2014 pageant, was 'dethroned' three months after her win. The organizers claim that May Myat Noe repeatedly complained about her schedule after the win and wanted her mother to stay with her during that 3-month period without having to pay the added expenses that would be incurred. Organizers also claimed she was rude and not returning phone calls. In her press conference, May Myat Noe criticized the organizers by saying, \\"I'm not even proud of this crown, I don't want a crown from an organization with such a bad reputation. But I won't give it back to the Koreans unless they apologize. Not just to me but my country for giving it a bad image\\". She stated she would hand over the crown to the Burmese authorities but not allow it to return to the organizers in South Korea until she received a formal apology. She further stated that she, a 16-year-old, was coerced to escort Korean tycoons: \\"I was told that, in order to generate funds to produce my music album, I need to accept invitations to escort some business tycoons whenever they require my company\\". During a media interview with MBC TV on Sept 14 in Yangon, Myanmar, she said \\"I am still a minor. If I'm saying I've operated my breast, then the organization is backward. When my mother and I signed the consent operation agreement, I thought it was medical check. I didn't know the meaning of the signature\\". It was then revealed that Noe lied about her age to participate in a local pageant in Yangon in 2013. In September 2015, the organization filed charges against May Myat Noe with the Gangnam, Seoul, Police Station, for defamation, false accusation and breach of management contract.'MBC 리얼스토리 눈' 미스 미얀마 아웅 가슴 성형? \\"건강검진인줄 알고…\\", 더팩트 2014.09.16\\"성접대 강요\\" 폭로 미스 미얀마, 100억원대 피소, 데일리안 2014.09.27 The organization then filed a libel suit against Andre Jung Weon-young and other newspapers. The organization formally accused Noe of defamation in September 2015. ==Titleholders== Himangini Singh Yadu (left, with Sushmita Sen) returns after winning Miss Asia Pacific World 2012 {  !Year !Country !Miss Asia Pacific World !National Title !Location !Delegates -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2014   Swetha Raj Femina Miss India  rowspan=\\"2\\" Seoul, South Korea 39 -  May Myat Noe (Dethroned) Miss Myanmar 38 - 2013  Srishti Rana Miss Diva Mar Del Plata, Argentina 41 - 2012  Himangini Singh Yadu  I am she-Miss Universe India Seoul, South Korea 39 - 2011  Diana Starkova  Miss Ukraine Viña Del Mar, Chile 54 - } Note: Pageant Not Held from 2015–2019 ==By year2011=== The 2011 competition was the first edition of the Miss Asia Pacific World pageant.

At the age of four, he, along with his parents, left Sikkim for Dehradun to get basic education and later went to Ludhiana , Punjab University for his graduation. In 1945, he went to United Services Pre-Cadet College Belgaum to join the army. He was court-martialed due to his direct and open letter to a high-ranking army officer, on the corrupt practices of his superiors. In his letter he stated about “the dissatisfaction prevailing in 2/5 Gurkha Rifles”, which was not supported by other high-ranking officers. He was sent for a rigorous three months imprisonment, but was released after spending one and a half months in the jail. After resigning from the Indian Army, he went to the Himalayas in search for spiritual satisfaction. After a brief sojourn in the Himalayan foothills he returned home to his wife (Sumitra) and his children. In 1961, he sat for the Sikkim's first Civil Service Examinations and was appointed as a magistrate in Gangtok. The life of a public servant in a feudal monarchy was not his cup of tea. He resigned and left for Kathmandu where he worked as a journalist. His close relations with student leaders active in the pro democracy movement of Nepal led to his arrest and incarceration for nine months. This experience of jail in Nepal is documented in his book \\"His Majesty's Paying Guest\\". ==Politics== Basnet joined the Sikkim National Congress, a political party headed by L.D. Kazi appointed as Joint Secretary of the Party. In the general election of 1967, the Sikkim National Congress won 10 out of 18 seats. Much credit for the victory goes to Basnett for his political stalwartness. Because of his divergent political views with L.D. Kazi he resigned from the Sikkim National Congress and founded the Sikkim Janata Party in 1969.Author Search His party was active in the pro-democracy movement in the kingdom of Sikkim. After victory in the election of 1979, he was elected as the deputy speaker of the Sikkim Legislative Assembly. ==Bibliography== * Sikkim: A Short Political History by Lal Bahadur Basnet. S.

A Republican, Morris has been a member of the Louisiana State Senate for the 35th district in North Louisiana since 2020. From 2012 until 2020, Morris was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 14, which encompasses Ouachita and Morehouse parishes in the northeastern portion of his state. ==Background== Morris formerly worked on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., for former U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a Democrat. He was also a staff member at one time for the Louisiana Municipal Association. He is a partner of the law firm, Dean Morris, LLP. Prior to residing in Monroe, Morris lived in St. Joseph in Tensas Parish, Rayville in Richland Parish, and New Orleans. ==Unseating Sam Little== Morris won the state representative position in the general election held on November 19, 2011, when he unseated fellow Republican Sam Little, a retired farmer, originally from Bastrop in Morehouse Parish. Morris polled 5,005 votes (59.1 percent) to Little's 3,463 ballots (40.9 percent). In the campaign for the heavily redistricted seat, Little and Morris accused each other of engaging in negative campaigning. Morris is a graduate of Louisiana State University and the Louisiana State University Law Center, both in Baton Rouge. Morris led the three-candidate field in the primary held on October 22, with 5,078 votes (42.6 percent). Little trailed with 4,384 ballots (36.7 percent). A third Republican, Michael Echols, held the remaining but critical 2,471 votes (20.7 percent). Echols ran without opposition in the 2019 primary to choose Morris' House successor. From 1991 to 2008, the District 14 seat was held by the Democrat Charles R. McDonald of Bastrop in Morehouse Parish. ==Congressional defeat== On August 13, 2013, Morris announced that he would enter Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election, 2013 to choose a successor to Republican Rodney Alexander, who resigned from Congress effective September 30, 2013, to accept the position of secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs under Governor Bobby Jindal. Despite an aggressive campaign with radio spots on The Moon Griffon Show, Morris finished in sixth place with 7,083 votes (7 percent) and was eliminated from further contention. He led in no parishes and polled his strongest total, 2,932 votes, in his own Ouachita Parish, but even there he finished fourth. The runoff election was held on November 16, 2013 between two Republicans, State Senator Neil Riser of Columbia in Caldwell Parish, the front-runner backed by the party establishment, and a dark horse contender, Vance McAllister, a Monroe-area businessman originally from West Carroll Parish who carries the celebrity endorsement of Phil Robertson of the A&E; Network reality show, Duck Dynasty, filmed in West Monroe. McAllister's positions are similar to those of Morris, and the two candidates hence competed from the same pool of voters. McAllister scored a major upset when he defeated Riser by a margin of nearly 60 to 40 percent. ==Legislative ratings, record and issues== Morris's legislative ratings have ranged from 78 to 94 percent from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2012, he was rated 100 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2013 and 2014, he was rated 80 and 90 percent, respectively, by the conservative Louisiana Family Forum. In 2013 and 2014, Louisiana Right to Life scored him 100 percent. The Louisiana Association of Educators rated him 8 and 25 percent, respectively. In 2014, Morris co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; the bill was approved by the full House, 88-5. In 2014, he voted for the extension of time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He voted against the prohibition of the transportation of dogs in the beds of pick-up trucks while traveling on interstate highways; the measure passed the House, 53-34. He voted against the requirement that companies must give notice when they engage in hydraulic fracking. He voted against the repeal of the anti-sodomy laws. He supported the establishment of surrogacy contracts. He voted against reducing the penalties for the possession of marijuana, but the measure passed the House, 54-38. He voted for lifetime concealed carry gun permits and the establishment of concealed-carry privileges in restaurants that sell alcoholic beverages. He co-sponsored the prohibition against making information about gun permit holders a matter of public record. He voted in 2013 against an increase in judicial pay, which passed the House, 78-18. He supported the removal of the mandatory retirement age for judges, which was rejected 63-33. In 2012, Morris voted against the prohibition of the use of telephones while driving; the ban nevertheless passed the House, 68-29. He opposed tax incentives for attracting a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana, which passed the House, 60-41. He backed the establishment of state income tax deductions for individuals who contribute to scholarship funds, which was approved 66-37. He voted to reduce the number of hours that polling locations remain open; Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. He supported drug testing of certain welfare recipients; the bill passed the House, 65 to 26. He supported changes in the teacher tenure law. Morris ran unopposed for reelection to a second term in the state House in the nonpartisan blanket primary election held on October 24, 2015. In May 2017, Morris opposed in the House Ways and Means Committee a plan by his Republican colleague, Rob Shadoin of Ruston which collectively would have raised taxes on businesses and lowered them for what Shadoin said would constitute 90 percent of individual taxpayers. When his measure was killed in committee, Shadoin said, \\"You can kiss tax reform goodbye.\\" Four individual bills were combined into one on the advice of Shadoin's Democratic ally, Major Thibaut of New Roads. Morris said that the opponents of Shadoin's bill managed to stop the legislation on the premise that the measure \\"would not help the state's fiscal situation and would in fact make it worse. At the same time it would have made the tax code much more progressive (making higher income earners pay more) and would have eliminated the deduction for federal income. The committee didn't see the benefit from a set of bills that made the state fiscal situation worse in the name of purported tax reform.\\" ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Louisiana state senators Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Businesspeople from Louisiana Category:Louisiana lawyers Category:Politicians from Monroe, Louisiana Category:People from St. Joseph, Louisiana Category:People from Rayville, Louisiana Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:Louisiana State University Law Center alumni Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Jay Morris"},{"id":"35852238","text":"Cretanaspis lushangfenensis is a species of beetle in the family Mordellidae, the only species in the genus Cretanaspis. ==References== Category:Mordellidae Category:Beetles described in 1999 ","title":"Cretanaspis"},{"id":"35852240","text":"Eygló Harðardóttir (born 12 December 1972) is an Icelandic politician.

Blo' Norton Fen is in the parish of Blo' Norton in Norfolk and Thelnetham Fen is in Thelnetham parish in Suffolk. It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 2, and part of the Waveney and Little Ouse Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation, Thelnetham Fen is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust and Blo' Norton Fen by the Little Ouse Headwaters Project (LOHP). ==Location== The site is located on the Norfolk-Suffolk border to the south of A1066 Diss to Thetford road and north of the A143 between Diss and Bury St Edmunds. It is west of Diss, south- east of Thetford and north-east of Bury St Edmunds. The Redgrave and Lopham Fen SSSI is east of the site. ==Ecology== The site consists of areas of calcareous fen wetland and associated carr woodland and meadow along the Little Ouse river which marks the county boundary. It is notable for being an internationally important site for the rare black bog rush Schoenus nigricans and saw sedge Cladium mariscus plant species. The site supports a \\"very large number of plant species\\" on the wetter fen areas. Dominant species tend to be black bog rush Schoenus nigricans, saw sedge Cladium mariscus and purple moor grass Molinia caerulea, with species such as fen orchid Dactylorchis praetermissa, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, long-stalked yellow sedge Carex lepidocarpa, quaking grass Briza media, parnassus Parnassia palustris and a number of rare mosses also found in these areas. Other areas of the fen become drier during periods of dry weather and support a different range of plant life. Taller vegetation is more common, particularly reed Phragmites australis and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria. Different plants are associated with this vegetation, increasing biodiversity to include species such as hemp agrimony Eupatorium cannabinum, purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria and great hairy willowherb Epilobium hirsutum. Scrub and woodland vegetation has developed throughout the fens with sallow and alder predominant in these areas, although Blo' Norton Fen has some oak and ash woodland. Surrounding meadowlands and ditches support other species, including, for example, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, marsh marigold Caltha palustris. Bird species found on the site include snipe and grasshopper warbler and the protected Eurasian water shrew is found in the area. ==Management== Management includes the managed cutting of fen vegetation on a four year rotation in order to maintain biodiversity and a range of habitats.Blo' Norton Fen, Little Ouse Headwaters Project. Retrieved 2013-01-31. The adjacent area of Hinderclay Fen was removed from the SSSI area in 1983 following drainage projects causing the area to dry out.Hinderclay Fen, Little Ouse Headwaters Project. Retrieved 2013-01-31. The LOHP has begun to manage the area to return the area to a more semi-natural state, including cutting scrub vegetation and creating ponds on the site. The fen areas were traditionally used for sites for cutting peat for fuel and for fuelwood. Marked paths, including areas of boardwalk and a footbridge across the Little Ouse, provide access for visitors and the Angles Way path passes through the SSSI. ==Access== There is access to Thelnetham Fen from Loggers Lane and Blo' Norton Fen from Fen Road.

In transshipment, transportation may or must go through intermediate nodes, possibly changing modes of transport. The Transshipment problem has its origins in medieval times when trading started to become a mass phenomenon. Obtaining the minimum-cost route had been the main priority. However, technological development slowly gave priority to minimum-duration transportation problems. == Overview == Transshipment or Transhipment is the shipment of goods or containers to an intermediate destination, and then from there to yet another destination. One possible reason is to change the means of transport during the journey (for example from ship transport to road transport), known as transloading. Another reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment (consolidation), dividing the large shipment at the other end (deconsolidation). Transshipment usually takes place in transport hubs. Much international transshipment also takes place in designated customs areas, thus avoiding the need for customs checks or duties, otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport. == Formulation of the problem == A few initial assumptions are required in order to formulate the transshipment problem completely: * The system consists of m origins and n destinations, with the following indexing respectively: i=1,\\\\ldots, m, j=1,\\\\ldots, n * One uniform good exists which needs to be shipped * The required amount of good at the destinations equals the produced quantity available at the origins * Transportation simultaneously starts at the origins and is possible from any node to any other (also to an origin and from a destination) * Transportation costs are independent of the shipped amount == Notations == * t_{r,s}: time of transportation from node r to node s * a_i: goods available at node i * b_{m+j}: demand for the good at node (m+j) * x_{r,s}: actual amount transported from node r to node s == Mathematical formulation of the problem == The goal is to minimize \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^m \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j=1}^n t_{i,j} x_{i,j} subject to: * x_{r,s}\\\\geq 0 ; \\\\forall r=1\\\\ldots m , s=1\\\\ldots n * \\\\sum_{s=1}^{m+n}{x_{i,s}}-\\\\sum_{r=1}^{m+n}{x_{r,i}}=a_i; \\\\forall i=1\\\\ldots m * \\\\sum_{r=1}^{m+n}{x_{r,m+j}}-\\\\sum_{s=1}^{m+n}{x_{m+j,s}}=b_{m+j}; \\\\forall j=1\\\\ldots n * \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{a_i}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{b_{m+j}} == Solution == Since in most cases an explicit expression for the objective function does not exist, an alternative method is suggested by Rajeev and Satya. The method uses two consecutive phases to reveal the minimal durational route from the origins to the destinations. The first phase is willing to solve n\\\\cdot m time- minimizing problem, in each case using the remained n+m-2 intermediate nodes as transshipment points. This also leads to the minimal-durational transportation between all sources and destinations. During the second phase a standard time-minimizing problem needs to be solved. The solution of the time- minimizing transshipment problem is the joint solution outcome of these two phases. === Phase 1 === Since costs are independent from the shipped amount, in each individual problem one can normalize the shipped quantity to 1. The problem now is simplified to an assignment problem from i to m+j. Let x'_{r,s}=1 be 1 if the edge between nodes r and s is used during the optimization, and 0 otherwise. Now the goal is to determine all x'_{r,s} which minimize the objective function: T_{i,m+j}=\\\\sum_{r=1}^{m+n}\\\\sum_{s=1}^{m+n}{t_{r,s}\\\\cdot x'_{r,s}}, such that * \\\\sum_{s=1}^{m+n}{x'_{r,s}}=1 * \\\\sum_{r=1}^{m+n}{x'_{r,s}}=1 * x'_{m+j,i}=1 * x'_{r,s}=0,1.  Corollary  * x'_{r,r}=1 and x'_{m+j,i}=1 need to be excluded from the model; on the other hand, without the x'_{m+j,i}=1 constraint the optimal path would consist only of x'_{r,r}-type loops which obviously can not be a feasible solution. * Instead of x'_{m+j,i}=1, t_{m+j,i}=-M can be written, where M is an arbitrarily large positive number. With that modification the formulation above is reduced to the form of a standard assignment problem, possible to solve with the Hungarian method. === Phase 2 === During the second phase, a time minimization problem is solved with m origins and n destinations without transshipment. This phase differs in two main aspects from the original setup: * Transportation is only possible from an origin to a destination * Transportation time from i to m+j is the sum of durations coming from the optimal route calculated in Phase 1. Worthy to be denoted by t'_{i,m+j} in order to separate it from the times introduced during the first stage.  In mathematical form  The goal is to find x_{i,m+j}\\\\geq 0 which minimize z=max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{t'_{i,m+j}: x_{i,m+j}>0\\\\;\\\\; (i=1\\\\ldots m,\\\\; j=1\\\\ldots n)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, such that * \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{x_{i,m+j}}=a_i * \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_{i,m+j}}=b_{m+j} * \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{a_i}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{b_{m+j}} This problem is easy to be solved with the method developed by Prakash. The set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{t'_{i,m+j}, i=1\\\\ldots m,\\\\; j=1\\\\ldots n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} needs to be partitioned into subgroups L_k, k=1\\\\ldots q, where each L_k contain the t'_{i,m+j}-s with the same value. The sequence L_k is organized as L_1 contains the largest valued t'_{i,m+j}'s L_2 the second largest and so on. Furthermore, M_k positive priority factors are assigned to the subgroups \\\\sum_{L_k}{x_{i,m+j}}, with the following rule: \\\\alpha M_k-\\\\beta M_{k+1}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{cc}-ve, & if\\\\; \\\\alpha<0\\\\\\\\\\\\ ve, & if\\\\; \\\\alpha>0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right. for all \\\\beta.

She is also currently a member of the Louisiana delegation of the Republican National Committee. Whitney lost her bid for a second term in the runoff election held on November 21, 2015. A year earlier, she had been an unsuccessful candidate in the nonpartisan blanket primary for Louisiana's 6th congressional district seat. ==Background== Whitney graduated from Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma and obtained an associate degree in business from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Since she was sixteen, she has operated a small business. She claims to have sales experience in oil field fabrication, repair and maintenance, and the media and telecommunications. Her husband, Lee Whitney, operates Whitney Signs Company in Houma. He was reared in Houma and Upper Caillou and established a lifelong friendship with the politically connected Chabert family. Whitney traces her family tree on the Ledet and Boquet side directly to the Bourg/Montegut's families. Whitney has two children, both graduates of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. ==Political career== In 2011, Whitney won the right to succeed the term- limited Democrat Damon Baldone by defeating fellow Republican Billy Hebert, a member of the Terrebonne Parish Council, 3,709 (59 percent) to 2,552 (41 percent). District 53 encompasses the Oakshire, Broadmoor, Park Avenue, Bayou Blue, Cocodrie, Montegut, Bourg, and Pointe-aux-Chenes sections of Houma, the parish seat of Terrebonne Parish. Whitney is the first woman to represent Terrebonne in the legislature and the first Republican to hold the District 53 seat. On September 19, 2014, Whitney received the \\"Outstanding Family Advocate Award\\" from the Louisiana Family Forum. Whitney ran in the November 4, 2014, nonpartisan blanket primary for Louisiana's 6th congressional district, being vacated by the physician Bill Cassidy, who is instead challenging Mary Landrieu for the United States Senate. Four of her intraparty opponents were Garret Graves, Trey Thomas, Paul Dietzel, II, grandson of a Louisiana State University football coach and athletic director, and attorney Dan Claitor of Baton Rouge, who in 2009 succeeded Cassidy in the Louisiana State Senate. A Democratic candidate in the running, former Governor Edwin Edwards, led the field in the primary and faces a December 6 runoff election with the second- place candidate, Garret Graves. Whitney finished a distant fifth with 19,146 votes (7.4 percent) of the ballots cast. ===Campaign controversy=== On June 25, 2014, Lenar Whitney stated in a campaign video that human-caused climate change is \\"the greatest deception in the history of mankind.\\" Dismissing evidence of global warming presented in Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth and the consensus of scientific opinion that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities, Whitney claimed that in the past ten years the planet \\"has done nothing but get colder each year.\\" As evidence, Whitney stated \\"any 10-year-old can invalidate [the theses of climate scientists] with one of the simplest scientific devices known to man: a thermometer.\\" Fact checker website PolitiFact.com ruled that, \\"There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney's supporting evidence falls flat. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.\\" Whitney further stated in her campaign video that she attributes the phasing out of high-energy light bulbs in the United States to \\"progressives\\" instead of U.S. President George W. Bush, who signed that law. Whitney also stated that she believes that \\"many Middle East countries\\" want to \\"blow the United States off the face of the Earth,\\" using funds from selling petroleum to the United States, citing no evidence. Nonpartisan analyst David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report called Whitney \\"the most frightening candidate I've met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls.\\" Wasserman reported that while interviewing her on July 23, 2014, he asked Whitney for the source of her claim that the earth is getting colder. \\"She froze and was unable to cite a single scientist, journal, or news source to back up her beliefs.\\" When Whitney was asked if she doubted the Hawaiian birthplace of U.S. President Barack Obama, her campaign consultants pulled her from the interview and thereafter called Wasserman's attitude \\"belittling\\". Wasserman said, \\"It was the first time in hundreds of Cook Political Report meetings that a candidate has fled the room.\\" Whitney later claimed that Wasserman attacked her: \\"It was obvious, from the onset of the interview, that Wasserman had planned to jump me simply because I am a conservative woman... liberal shills like [him] want to destroy us.\\" Steve Benen, producer of The Rachel Maddow Show, commented, \\"A tip for candidates everywhere: if you literally run away from questions, you’re doing it wrong.\\" ===2015 reelection defeat=== Whitney's congressional race may have negatively impacted her prospects for holding on to her state House seat for a second term. With 3,064 votes (34.25 percent), she fell nine votes short of a plurality in the October 24 primary. The leading candidate was a second Republican candidate, attorney Tanner Magee of Houma, who received 3,073 votes (34.35 percent). Holding the key to victory was the Democratic candidate, Brenda Leroux Babin, who polled 2,809 ballots (31.4 percent). In the runoff election on November 21 in conjunction with the victory of the Democrat John Bel Edwards as governor, Whitney was handily unseated by Tanner Magee, who polled 4,978 votes (60.8 percent) to her 3,206 votes (39.2 percent). ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:Businesspeople from Louisiana Category:Nicholls State University alumni Category:Women state legislators in Louisiana Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:People from Houma, Louisiana Category:American people of French descent Category:Republican National Committee members ","title":"Lenar Whitney"},{"id":"35852353","text":"Captain John Buxton Pelham, 8th Earl of Chichester (12 June 1912 – 21 February 1944), styled The Honourable John Pelham until 1926, was a British diplomat.

It is only known from Fuding in northeastern Fujian, from the locality where it was described as a new species in 2010. Although it is genetically similar to the Chinese fire belly newt (C. orientalis), it is morphologically more similar to the Dayang fire belly newt (C. orphicus). The range of C. fudingensis is separate from both other species. A revised taxonomy of Salamandridae places this species (together with all other Chinese species of Cynops) in genus Hypselotriton. Cynops fudingensis is a small newt, usually less than in total length. The population from which the species was described lives in small, still-water puddles and ditches of a deserted agricultural field on a hillside near Taimushan (Mt. Taimu), west of Fuding City. Another nearby population may already be extinct. The species is not known from elsewhere, and the known population is threatened by habitat destruction associated with tourism, introduced predators (such as bullfrogs and red-eared slider turtles), and collection by herpetological hobbyists. Reproduction requires the presence of a larger group of newts. Eggs are laid in April and are wrapped singly in leaves of water plants.

Henry Jackson Ellicott (June 22 or 23, 1847 in Annapolis, Maryland - February 11, 1901 in Washington, D.C.) was an American sculptor and architectural sculptor, best known for his work on American Civil War monuments. ==Biography== Plaster statue of Abraham Lincoln, in United States Capitol rotunda, August 1868. The son of James P. Ellicott and Fannie Adelaide Ince, he attended Rock Hill College School in Ellicott City, Maryland, and Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C. He studied at Georgetown Medical College, and may have served in the Civil War.An 1896 New York Times article implies that the 16-year-old Ellicott was present at the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. At age 19, he completed a larger-than-life plaster statue of Abraham Lincoln - likely an entry in the Lincoln Monument Association's competition for a marble statue - that was exhibited for two years in the United States Capitol rotunda. The competition was won by sculptor Lot Flannery, whose statue is at District of Columbia City Hall. The fate of Ellicott's Lincoln statue is unknown.Louis A. Warren, \\"The Curious Story of Ellicott's Lincoln,\\" Lincoln Herald, vol. 48-49, 1946.

It contains a single species, Marmoretta oxoniensis. ==Discovery== Marmoretta is known from holotype BMNH R.12020, the anterior region of a right maxilla. Many specimens are referred to the species from the type locality, and together represent a nearly complete skull. All specimens are housed in the Natural History Museum. They were collected from the Mammal Bed of the Forest Marble Formation, at Kirtlington, Oxfordshire, which has yielded a rich assemblage of small vertebrates including mammals, frogs, salamanders and other small reptiles. Marmoretta is very common in that locality but its remains are fragmentary. In 1994, additional specimens of Marmoretta were described from the Kilmaluag Formation (previously known as the Ostracod Limestones) of the Great Estuarine Group in Skye. Thesa material of Marmoretta includes the first associated skull and postcranial remains. They confirm the original description and reconstruction, and provide additional support for position of Marmoretta as the sister taxon of Lepidosauria. Both localities dates to the Late Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic period, about 166.2-164.7 million years ago. ==Phylogeny== Susan E. Evans and Magdalena Borsuk−Białynicka (2009) performed a phylogenetic analysis that recovered Sophineta as the sister group of Lepidosauria. The inclusion of Sophineta displaced the relictual Middle Jurassic Marmoretta and gave the origin of Lepidosauria much older age. The cladogram below follows their results. ==Etymology== Marmoretta was first described and named by Susan E. Evans in 1991 and the type species is Marmoretta oxoniensis. The generic name is derived from Latin marmoros, meaning \\"Marble\\" and refers to the Forest Marble Formation - the source of the initial specimens of Marmoretta. The specific name is derived from Oxonia, the Latinised form of \\"Oxford\\", in reference to Oxfordshire. ==References== Category:Jurassic lepidosauromorphs Category:Fossil taxa described in 1991 Category:Extinct animals of Europe Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Taxa named by Susan E.

He was educated at the common schools there and later became a farmer. Warman married Ida Blanch Hays of St. Jacob, Illinois in 1879. In 1880, after failing as a wheat broker in Pocahontas, Illinois, Mr. Warman migrated to Denver, Colorado where the Colorado Silver Mining Boom was in progress. There, Warman worked for the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad progressing from a \\"wiper\\" (charged with keeping the engine area clean) to locomotive fireman and later to railroad engineer. These experiences became the basis for many of his early writings. In 1888, Mr. Warman became editor of the publication Western Railway. He sold his interest in Western Railway in March 1892 and relocated to Creede, Colorado at the height of the Creede mining boom. There, he founded the Creede Daily Chronicle. Warman achieved national recognition in 1892 when, after riding from New York City to Chicago in the cab of the locomotive The Exposition Flyer, he wrote his first railroad story, \\"A Thousand Miles in a Night\\" for McClure's Magazine. This was the first of a series of widely popular \\"True Tales of the Railroad\\" articles written for McClure's. Warman's first wife, Ida, died in 1887. Warman remarried in 1892 to Miss Marie Myrtle Jones. Miss Jones inspired the lines for \\"Sweet Marie\\", a song which became a popular success in 1893 and was later featured in the 1947 film Life With Father starring Irene Dunne and William Powell. Warman's writing also attracted the attention of the editors of the New York Sun. The Sun sponsored him in a journey of over 500 miles on horseback throughout the San Juan mining district of Colorado. The writings inspired by this journey were then published as regular and occasional pieces by The Sun. For two years after his early successes, Warman traveled in Europe and the Far East as well as Alaska. Upon his return, he lived in Washington for several years and finally built a home in London, Ontario where he lived until his death in 1914. ==Death== In the winter of 1913-1914, Warman was stricken with paralysis while in a hotel in Chicago. He died several months later at the St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago after having been acutely ill for several weeks. ==Partial List of WorksBooks And Pamphlets=== *1892: *1894: *1895: *1897: *1898: *1899: *1899: *1904: With Patrick Donan. *1906: *1906: *1908: *1911: ===Journals and Periodicals=== *1892: Poetry. *1893: *1894: *1894: *1894: *1894: *1894: Poetry. *1895: *1895: *1895: *1896: *1896: *1896: *1897: *1897: *1897: Poetry. *1898: *1898: *1898: *1899: *1900: *1900: Poetry. *1900: *1902: *1903: Poetry. *1906: *1906: *1906: *1911: ==See also== * Warman, Saskatchewan * Warman railway station * Robert W.

The Musée du Pays Châtillonnais, or Trésor de Vix, formerly called the musée archéologique de Châtillon-sur-Seine (Côte-d'Or), was created in the late nineteenth century and is managed by the community of communes of the Pays Châtillonnais. The museum houses the finding of the Vix Grave, and especially the famous Vix krater, dated to circa 500 BCE and testifying to the links between the Gauls and the Greeks at that period. ==History== The old museum building, July 2008 Throughout France the second half of the nineteenth century was an era of growing interest in archeology. The subject was particularly popular in the Côte-d'Or region since major excavations had been organized by Napoleon III on the site of Alesia, from Châtillon. In 1882 the Châtillon Archaeological and Historical Society opened the first museum, to be a museum of archaeology. The region is rich in archaeological relics. The excavations of the Gallo-Roman Vertillum, about fifteen miles away, and those of Mount Lassois, produced a large number of objects. In 1928 the society acquired a Renaissance hotel downtown, the hotel Philandrier, named after William Philandrier, an architect born in Chatillon in the 16th century. In 1950 the museum expanded with a move into the hotel, which provided an exhibition area of . Three years later the discovery of the Vix Grave, a burial of prime importance for its richness and historical interest, brought international recognition to the museum. It was able to collect all the treasures of the site, which otherwise would probably have been taken to the National Archaeological Museum at Saint-Germain-en- Laye. In 2009, the museum left the hotel Philandrier, which had become too cramped, and moved to the old abbey of Notre-Dame de Châtillon. Founded in the 12th century by Bernard of Clairvaux and rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries, the chateau had until recently been a hospital and nursing home. The design of the new museum was assigned to the architect Antoine Stinco. The new museum site has in a prestigious setting. Taking advantage of the move, the museum reorganized its collection, which now covers the entire prehistory and history of the region up to the 18th century. ==Collections == *Prehistory: Numerous chance finds, excavations of mount Lassois Mount and the Cave of La Grande Baume at Balot. *Early History: The graves of Sainte- Colombe-sur-Seine, the Treasure of Vix with the famous Cratère de Vix.

He was the third son of Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones, 1st Marquis of Mondéjar and Francesca Pacheco. His siblings were Luis, Maria, Antonio and Diego Hurtado. ==Early days of naval career== Bernardino was destined for a career in the Spanish Navy. Already in his youth, he sailed with two galleys to fight the Barbary corsairs in the Mediterranean Sea, at his own expense. In October 1525, he participated in the failed attempt to reconquer Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, led by his brother Luis Hurtado de Mendoza y Pacheco, 2nd Marquis of Mondéjar and Captain General of Granada. ==Captain General of the Galleys of Spain== In 1533, he became Captain General of the Galleys of Spain. In 1535 he led twelve galleys, some of them previously captured from the Turks, to take part in the Conquest of Tunis (1535). He remained in Tunis, to defend the fortress of La Goleta at the head of 1,000 Spanish troops. He returned to sea with six galleys, but was recalled to La Goleta to prevent the unpaid and mutinous Spanish garrison from selling the fortress to the Turks. He sailed them to Sicily with a promise of payment. When they were not paid there either, the troops caused problems in Sicily. In 1540, Bernardino gained an important victory in the Battle of Alborán, crushing superior Turkish forces. He was injured at the head and partially lost control of the use of his arms. One year later, he led 15 galleys in the failed Algiers expedition. In 1550, he won another important battle against the Turks, when he took Mahdiye. ==Foreign wars and his death== In 1555, he was temporarily Viceroy of Naples because Cardinal Pedro Pacheco de Villena attended the Papal conclave, May 1555. One year later, King Philip II of Spain made him State Councilor. Very uncomfortable at court, Bernardino soon left for Flanders to fight under Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy against the French. After the Battle of St. Quentin (1557), he was charged with reinforcing the city's defences, but he died soon after from his wounds received in the battle. == Marriage and children == He married Elvira Carrillo y Córdoba and had at least 5 children : * Juan Hurtado de Mendoza y Carrillo, also Captain General of the galleys and commander of La Goleta.

Asian Affairs 35, no. 1 (2008): 15-29. It is unclear what happened during the armed conflict because reports of the incident vary greatly. == Chinese account == According Chinese records, four major planning meetings were held in the run up to the insurrection, one of which was devoted to the procuring of supplies, including weapons and white uniforms. Toward the end of March 1990, the rebels ran a training camp to prepare for the fight ahead. Stolen money was used to buy weapons and vehicles. According to Chinese records, the Uyghurs were forced to move more quickly than they had intended because their plot was on the verge of being discovered. Hundreds of homemade bombs were made in a blacksmith shop in Kashgar and transported to Barin before the rebellion. (Sourced to the Xinjiang Public Security Gazette (), pages 790-795) Chinese sources state that the uprising was initiated by 200 Uyghur militants armed with advanced weaponry who attacked Chinese paramilitary forces throughout the township of Barin (Baren). These reports indicate that Afghani militia forces may have been directly involved. Reportedly, Afghan-trained Islamists set up loudspeakers in mosques of Barin Township urging the local Uyghur population to \\"rise up against Chinese oppression and work toward establishing an independent Uyghur Islamic state\\" while praising jihad. A large group of rebels reportedly attacked and burned a police bus, killing the police with knives and taking their weapons. In response, Chinese government forces crushed the uprising by force over the course of three days. == Uyghur account == On April 5, 1990, in Kizilsu's Akto County and in the township of Barin (Baren), Zeydin Yusup, the leader of the East Turkistan Islamic Party, led a protest with around 200 men. They marched to the local government office and demanded an end to the mass immigration of Han Chinese into Xinjiang. One source states that the protests were the result of 250 forced abortions imposed upon local Uyghur women by the Chinese government. Another source states that the protests were the result of local Uyghurs not being allowed to build a mosque. The Chinese government initially sent in a detachment of armed police to the site of the disturbance. The Uyghur forces and the authorities started fighting, and the violence spread through the town. The uprising, which lasted for several days, ended when the Chinese government sent hundreds of heavily armed police and soldiers to quell the riots. The Turkistan Islamic Party mentioned the Barin (Baren) Township riot in issue 1 of its magazine, Islamic Turkistan, in an article about the region's history. The third issue of its magazine commemorated the death of Zeydin Yusup (Dia al din bin Yusuf), the TIP member involved in the Barin Township riot. Khalid Turkistani wrote an article in Issue 13 of the \\"Islamic Turkistan\\" magazine, saying he was a participant in the \\"jihad\\" in Barin and was jailed for it by the Chinese government in 1990. Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı mentioned a brief history of the Turkistan Islamic Party, from Zeyiddin Yusuf founding it in 1988 in \\"East Turkestan\\", to its participation in the riots and insurgency, its \\"jihad in the path of Allah\\", its migration in 1996 under Hasan Mahsum to the Taliban controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, and its war since 2001 against the \\"Crusaders\\" for 15 years in the \\"Afghan jihad\\", to 2012, when it entered the Syrian Civil War. == Aftermath == One source states that the conflict ended on April 10, 1990, with 23 dead total and 21 injured, and that 232 Uyghur fighters were captured. In July 1990 the Chinese government in Xinjiang announced the arrest of 7,900 people citing the \\"criminal activities of ethnic splittists and other criminal offenders\\" as the reason. In 2020, the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile commemorated the thirtieth anniversary of the event in its official journal. ==References== Category:Political riots Category:Xinjiang conflict Category:1990 in China Category:1990 riots Category:East Turkestan independence movement ","title":"Baren Township riot"},{"id":"35852815","text":"Veterans Memorial Park is one of four parks located along the Mississippi River in downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara put the total profits in the scheme at over $60 million, telling a news conference it was the largest hedge fund insider trading case in United States history. Jim Walden, an attorney for Mr. Rajaratnam, said his client is innocent and will fight the insider-trading charges. Rajaratnam allegedly profited from information received from: * Robert Moffat, a senior executive of IBM considered next in line to be CEO * Anil Kumar, a senior executive of McKinsey and close friend of Gupta (its former CEO) who was later also accused of passing information to Rajaratnam * Rajiv Goel, a midlevel Intel Capital executive * Roomy Khan, previously convicted of wire fraud for providing inside information from her employer, Intel, to Rajaratnam.USDC NDCA case no. 5:01-cr-20029-JW USA v.

The Sri Lankan stock market fell sharply after his arrest on insider trading charges in October 2009. Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the active stock trading of Raj Rajaratnam with a view of identifying any insider trading. It said he also conspired to get confidential information on the $5 billion purchase by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway of Goldman preferred stock before the September 2008 announcement of that transaction. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that a former member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs and former McKinsey & Company chief executive Rajat Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's investment before it became public. Gupta stood to profit as would-be chairman of Galleon International, a co-founder of New Silk Route with Rajaratnam, and as a friend of Rajaratnam. In March 2011 Gupta was charged in an administrative proceeding by the SEC. Gupta maintained his innocence, countersued, won dismissal of the administrative charge, then was arrested on criminal charges. ==Gupta charges and trial== On March 19, 2010, it was announced that Gupta had decided not to stand for re-election to the Goldman Sach's board of directors. At the time this was seen as a reaction to the insider trading implications; however, wiretaps released over a year later in U.S. v Rajaratnam of Anil Kumar speaking to Rajaratnam reveal an anticipated conflict-of-interest with a senior advisory role at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Gupta has since stepped down as senior advisor to KKR. On April 15, 2010, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in the United States were investigating Gupta's involvement in providing insider information to Galleon hedge-fund founder Raj Rajaratnam during the financial crisis, in particular the $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman Sachs at the height of the financial crisis in Financial crisis of 2007–2008#Impact on financial markets.James, Frank, \\"Goldman Sachs Director Tied To Insider-Trading Scandal\\", NPR \\"two-way\\" blog, April 23, 2010 12:47 pm.

It is alleged that he illegally tipped Rajaratnam with insider information about Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble while serving on the boards of both companies. Rajaratnam, it is alleged, \\"used the information from Gupta to illegally profit in hedge fund trades. ... The information on Goldman made Rajaratnam's funds $17 million richer. ...

Wiretaps in U.S. v Rajaratnam were later played of Gupta asking Rajaratnam, \\"I want ... us to keep having the dialog as to ... how I can be helpful in Galleon International [and] Galleon Group.\\" After Rajaratnam's conviction and the revelations about to Gupta in the Rajaratnam trial, the difficulty of SEC's proving even the civil charges against Gupta was still deemed considerable by observers.

By April 2011 he had resigned from every board chairmanship or membership. In the high- profile insider trading case U.S. v Rajaratnam unfolding near the same time (March 2011), wiretaps were played of Gupta describing to Rajaratnam elements of the confidential meetings of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs, including its possible willingness to purchase commercial bank Wachovia or insurer AIG. On March 15, 2011 an FBI wiretap from July 28, 2008 was played in the U.S. v Rajaratnam trial between Rajat Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam in which the two men discuss Goldman Sachs, Anil Kumar, Galleon International and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The tapes caused concern for several reasons: * confidentiality Gupta revealed board-privileged material on Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, after a 34-year career respecting client confidentiality at McKinsey. This by itself, however, is unlikely to be sufficient to criminally charge Gupta, as it may not meet the standard for insider trading. The call can simply be construed as one friend calling another for help in preparing for a meeting with Gary Cohn, Goldman's president. (“AIG was definitely in the discussion mix.”) * habituality Gupta's information to Rajaratnam was delivered very casually, as though it were not uncommon. A Bloomberg profile quotes a CEO saying the wiretaps \\"sounded to him just like Gupta consulting a client.\\" * gain A key notion in insider trading is that of benefit to the tipper. This benefit does not have to be monetary; in the case of Galleon co- conspirator Robert Moffat of IBM, the gain was relational with Danielle Chiesi. Here the gain is clearly a chairman role in Rajaratnam-owned Galleon International and further investment opportunities with Rajaratnam, including New Silk Route and other Galleon funds. (“You’ve given me a position at Galleon International…that’s good enough.”) * complicity Gupta, as head of McKinsey for a decade, was well aware of McKinsey's rules prohibiting outside consulting. Yet he was neither surprised nor upset at protégé and business partner Anil Kumar’s illegal (by McKinsey rules) external dealings with Rajaratnam, particularly the offshore cash payments. It remains unclear whether Gupta was aware Rajaratnam was paying Kumar for inside information. (“I think you're being very generous...he [Kumar] should sometimes say thank you for that.”) * legal maneuvering Gupta's lawyer had released statements saying \\"There are no tapes or any other direct evidence of me tipping Mr Rajaratnam\\" and that \\"the business relationship between Mr Rajaratnam and I were strained.\\" Yet the tapes reveal Gupta divulging confidential (if not material nonpublic) information, and Gupta asking Rajaratnam for career advice. (“I wanted to get your straight opinion on whether you think I should do this KKR thing.”) * fragmentation In another tape, Anil Kumar asks Rajaratnam, \\"It’s now reached a point where it’s physically and humanly impossible to do the things he’s doing, right?\\" and the two wonder about Gupta's \\"fragmented\\" state. In another wiretap, Rajaratnam suggests to Kumar that Gupta \\"seemed tormented\\" at their last meeting. As the tapes were released McKinsey was holding its regular annual partners conference, and according to a spokeswoman was \\"monitoring the matter and taking it seriously as you would expect.” They later released a statement saying they were \\"appalled and deeply dismayed.\\" The firm has come under heavy criticism for having its former longtime senior partners and leaders (Gupta and Kumar) as well as a junior partner (Palecek) all involved in the insider trading scandal. On March 18, 2011 Gupta countersued the SEC (SDNY 11 Cv. 1900). The court filing read, \\"Mr. Gupta denies all allegations of wrongdoing and stands ready to mount a defense against each and every one of the Commission's charges. Yet under current Commission rules, Mr. Gupta would be deprived of a jury trial, the right to use the discovery procedures of the federal court to shape his defense and the protections of the federal rules of evidence, which were crafted to bar unreliable evidence.\\" The countersuit said the SEC action \\"'unfairly and unconstitutionally' singles him out,” as he is to date the only person not employed by a broker-dealer ever charged by the SEC in administrative proceedings.Bray, Chad, \\"Ex-Goldman Director Sues SEC Over Charges\\", The Wall Street Journal (partially restricted access), March 19, 2011 It is not known whether the provisions of Dodd-Frank (the law allowing for SEC administrative proceedings in this instance) may be applied retroactively to before the law's existence, as the SEC has claimed in charging Gupta.Gupta v. SEC suit document wsj.com'. On March 23, 2011 Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified that Gupta had in fact divulged board- privileged material to Rajaratnam, though the particular information was allegedly confidential and not material nonpublic (the legal standard for insider trading). In July 2011, U.S. District Judge Rakoff refused to throw out the countersuit against the SEC\\"Judge Rakoff Won't Toss Rajat Gupta Suit Against SEC\\"; posted by Nate Raymond; from The Litigation Daily; July 12, 2011 4:59 PM.

Rajaratnam also \\"loaned Mr Gupta money so he could increase his investment in a Galleon fund.\\" Gupta knew that Rajaratnam was sending money to Kumar against McKinsey policies and possibly illegally. The three men were also not above gossip: Rajaratnam said Gupta \\"seemed tormented\\" while on the phone with Kumar, then turned around and called Kumar a \\"mini-Rajat\\" while on the phone with Gupta. Rajaratnam also told Kumar that \\"there had been a lot of innuendos\\" about Gupta and Lata Krishnan, with whom Gupta had co-founded the American India Foundation. ==Other concurrent insider-trading cases== With the conviction of Gupta, the US attorney in Manhattan Bharara's office had the case of Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the once-prominent hedge fund Level Global Investors, still ahead of it.Ahmed, Azam, and Peter Lattman, \\"Victory Spurs Speculation on Bharara’s Next Move\\", The New York Times DealBook blog, June 15, 2012.

It only consists of three known dinosaur genera: Condorraptor, Marshosaurus, and Piatnitzkysaurus. The most complete and well known member of this family is Piatnitzkysaurus, which also gives the family its name. ==Description== A skull of Marshosaurus showing the maxilla So far all known piatnitzkysaurids have only been found in Jurassic deposits of the western hemisphere. Piatnitzkysaurus and Condorraptor hail from the Cañadón Asfalto Formation of Argentina, which has been dated to the Middle Jurassic (approximately 165 million years ago). Marshosaurus was found in the Morrison Formation of the United States, which was dated to the Late Jurassic. Piatnitzkysaurids were among the first large theropods present in South America, and are evidence for a radiation of megalosauroids and other tetanurans in the middle Jurassic. Although there is strong support for their megalosauroid affinities, piatnitzkysaurids also share some traits with allosaurids, such as a 'sigmoidal' humerus. Piatnitzkysaurids can be distinguished from other megalosauroids due to the following synapomorphies (distinguishing features): * Nutrient foramina on the surface of the maxilla which are arranged in two parallel rows (also found in Eocarcharia and Shaochilong). * Vertically striated or ridged paradental plates (also found in Abelisauridae, Megalosaurus and Proceratosaurus). * Reduced parapophyses on the axis (also found in Coelophysoidea, Eustreptospondylus and Afrovenator). * Anteriorly inclined posterior dorsal neural spines (in parallel with Allosauroidea). * A humerus with a canted (bent forward, away from the body) distal condyle (also in Dilophosaurus, Poekilopleuron, Allosauridae and Fukuiraptor). This form has also been described as 'sigmoidal' (S-shaped). In addition, this family shows several reversals to basal Tetanuran traits. These include: * A short or absent anterior process of the maxilla (also in Metriacanthosauridae and Carcharodontosauridae). * Moderately developed (rather than reduced or absent) diapophyses on the axis. * No pleurocoels on the axis. ==Classification== Life restoration of Piatnitzkysaurus Piatnitzkysauridae is defined as all members of Megalosauroidea more closely related to Piatnitzkysaurus than to either Spinosaurus or Megalosaurus. Condorraptor, Marshosaurus, and Piatnitzkysaurus were all placed in a clade by Benson in 2010 during a redescription of Megalosaurus. This clade was defined as a family by Carrano et al in 2012. Piatnitzkysauridae has been recovered as the sister taxa to Megalosauria, a clade containing the megalosaurids (such as Megalosaurus and Torvosaurus) and the spinosaurids (such as Spinosaurus and Baryonyx). Condorraptor and Piatnitzkysaurus are generally grouped together within this family in a clade excluding Marshosaurus. This is not only due to Condorraptor and Piatnitzkysaurus being from the same locality and time period, but also due to them having flat anterior faces of presacral vertebrae as well as a pronounced ventral keel on the anterior dorsal vertebrae. Due to the strong resemblance to Piatnitzkysaurus, it has been suggested that the sister taxa Condorraptor could be better interpreted as the result of individual variation within the species, and not as separate taxa. The main noted differences between the two dinosaurs include both a less well developed enemial crest and a first sacral vertebra with a shallower fossa in Condorraptor.Novas, Fernando (2009). The Age of Dinosaurs in South America. Indiana University Press. p. 118. . Xuanhanosaurus, a problematic tetanuran with uncertain affinities, was placed as the sister taxon of these three genera when their relation was first observed in 2010. However, due to the incompleteness of Xuanhanosaurus's remains, this placement is considered uncertain. Other studies have considered Xuanhanosaurus a basal tetanuran. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. Because the authors amended the definition of Allosauroidea to include all theropods that are closer to Allosaurus fragilis than to either Megalosaurus bucklandii or Neornithes, the Piatnitzkysauridae was found to fall within Allosauroidea.

Combining the natural strength of kangaroo leather with a reinforced toe, Tackaberry had the winning combination. The following year in 1906, Tackaberry was flooded with orders from Hall's team members, the business took off from there and this specific style of boot became known as the Tackaberry. With his passing in 1937, Tackaberry's wife Helen sold the patent to CCM.

It was governed by the Tamil principles of: Aram, Maram, Pazhi, and Nan. If a monarch failed in the act of aram, it would then bring eternal blame (pali) from their own subjects. If, on the other hand, they failed in the act of muram, it would be shame (nan) to them. There were Aramkuru Avaiams in the capital cities of the Chera, the Chola and the Pandyas. ==The monarch== The King was the final court of appeal. A Pandya king mentions that he should be put into the boiling water for having appointed an unscrupulous person as judge in his court of justice. From this statement of the king it is possible to infer that the kings used to appoint Judges. It is said that a certain King transacted justice even while in a bath. ===Virtue and Valour=== Although Aram is normally translated as virtue and equated to the Sanskrit Dharma, and because of the interaction between them it has been impossible to draw a distinction between them. Aram co-existed with another concept of Maram; ara is used with reference to virtue, justice, actions taken with due consideration of context and custom; maram, on the other hand, is used to denote valour, courage, wrath, hatred, killing and strength. Hence, it was quite different from the concept Dharma. Maram got degenerated in its usage in course of time from valour into a vice. As such the distinction in Aram and Maram was a part of a dynamic system. It may be compared to the distinction between martial virtues and philosophical virtues in China. ===Aram as Justice=== The cardinal principle of law in that divine work is righteousness or aram. Persons who administered justice during the Sangam period were governed by the principles of equity embodied in the word, aram. Aram has a great latitude of meaning. Eight meanings are given to it as shown above. In the chapter called Chengonmai of Tirukkural, Tiruvalluvar conceptualises that: Government has to examine the crimes, which may be committed to show no favor to anyone, and to inflict such punishment as may be wisely resolved on. Kural 541 ==Courts of Law== The courts had various names including: Aram Vazhangum Manram (The Council which safeguards Justice), Ulaka aravai (Seat of World Justice) and Aramkurum avaiyam (Assembly that speaks Justice). The name was Sanskritised into Dharmasanam (Place of Dharma) after the Sangam period. ==Trials by Jury== Although the monarch was the supreme arbiter in all civil and criminal cases, the administration of Justice was devolved to Judges. The presiding Judge in each Court wore a peculiar headgear by which they were distinguished from other officers of the Court. Justice was administered free of charge to the suitors ; but the punishments were very severe and hence crimes were rare. The members of the jury never erred from the path of etiquette. They went into the details of the cases that came before them, studied them well arrived at the truth and gave their verdict. Those who served as juries were disinterested persons without likes or dislikes and without fear or favour. They maintained equanimity. They were known for honesty and integrity. ==Trials by ordeal== Sometimes peculiar methods were used to resolve cases. A particular method of trial by ordeal was to call upon the plaintiff to thrust his hand into a pot containing a cobra. If the cobra bit him, he was guilty and he was sentenced: if the cobra did not bite him, he was found innocent. ==Witnesses== When a certain case was presented to the court, one method of enquiry was by the examination of witnesses, there were then, as now, both false and true witnesses. The Sirupancamulam condemns the witness who deposes to an untruth. The false witness is mentioned as one among the six offenders of a State. The other five are pseudo-Sannyasins, housewives loose in morals, disloyal ministers, adulterers and tale-bearers. In different places of the Silappathikaram, deposing as false witness is treated as a great crime. Thus, we see how carefully justice was administered and the dignity of law and order was maintained. ==Legal code== There are references to the Book implying there was a Tamil legal code, but such a document has not yet been discovered. Although, some historians suggest it was the Tirukkural; this, however, is controversial. ==Specific cases== An interesting instance is that of a young lover who has gained the love of a woman but not the approval of her parents. The lover contemplates to lake the case to the Aramkuru Avaiam. In case a lover deserted a girl after having enjoyed her, and refused to marry her, the girl could bring the matter to the notice of the avai and it was the duty of avai to ascertain the truth and punish the offender. In the epic Cilapatikaram, Kovalan is infamously killed without trial by the Pandyan Kingdom. ==References== Category:Legal history of India Category:Ancient Tamil Nadu Category:Tamilakam ","title":"Legal system of ancient Tamil country"},{"id":"35853172","text":"Stenomordella is a genus of beetles in the family Mordellidae, containing the following species: * Stenomordella longeantennalis Ermisch, 1941 * Stenomordella macrocephala Franciscolo, 1965 * Stenomordella ochii Kiyoyama, 1975 ==References== Category:Mordellidae ","title":"Stenomordella"},{"id":"35853186","text":"St Illtyd's parish church Newcastle is an area and electoral ward of the town of Bridgend, Wales.

The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good. It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece. Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market. ==Decorative art as a trade commodity== The trade commodities included in the definition of \\"visual art\\" include the following: painting, drawing, sculpture in various materials, printmaking, photography, maps, performance art, installation art, mail art, assemblage art, textile arts, fashion design, video art, digital art, and product design. These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints. Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal. Therefore, art is considered intellectual property. The 4-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) classifies \\"Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques\\" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as \\"fine\\" art. The 4-digit harmonized commodity description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for \\"fine\\" art is 9701, which is classified as \\"Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand\\". ==History of international art trade== The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when Pope Pius II prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States. It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets. Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased. Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets. Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the Netherlands and New Spain. Throughout much of the early modern period, if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad. Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of Christie's and Sotheby's of London, which both still survive today. Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties. For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good. At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property. { +Highlights of Official Treatments of Imported Paintings and Sculpture in the USA, 1789–1865 - !

Context of change, exemptions -  1789  5  -  1790  10  A general increase in duties was prompted by revenue requirements -  1800  12.5  Upward revisions were made to \\"defray expenses in relation to the Barbary States\\". -  1812  30  Duties were more than doubled to finance the war with Britain -  1816  15  Imports of \\"any society incorporated for philosophical or literary purposes or for the encouragement of the fine arts\\" were placed on the free list. -  1824  15  Protectionist pressures generated advances in duties, overall, but duties on imported art were not changed. -  1832  0  Tariff Act of 1832: All paintings and sculpture were placed on the free list. -  1841–1842  20  Overall increase in rates was driven by needs of an empty Treasury. Though art duties were re-imposed, the \\"productions of American artists residing abroad\\" were added to the free list, along with imports of nonprofit cultural institutions. -  1846  0  All paintings entered free when imported as an object of taste and not of merchandise. -  1861  10  The requirements of the Civil War finance elevated overall rates. } During World War II, neutral Switzerland became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent. Most \\"degenerate\\" works of art that the Nazi government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered black markets. Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works. For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners. Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property. Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as eBay and Lauritz.com. ==Economic theory of art trade== Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the \\"secondary market\\" – rather than the \\"primary market\\" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer. For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture. It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data. Comparative advantage is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods. There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art, making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property. Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the marginal cost of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price. Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences. But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism: a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices. ===Determination of prices=== Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends. Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness. Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine. Economists use the hedonic regression (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art. This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to. ==Protectionism vs. Liberalization== Protectionism is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity. Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad. America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports. Protectionists view this as a modern form of American imperialism, which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete. Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity. Australian economist David Throsby argues that investment in \\"cultural capital\\" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture. Paul M. Bator, who helped negotiate and draft the UNESCO convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones. He explains in The International Trade in Art that \\"art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home\\". Proponents of liberalization in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products. Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight. Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, economies of scale, and agglomeration economies – enhance the case for opening markets. Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare. The \\"commodification objection\\" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists. Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market. This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade. The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate. In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics. More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated. ==Largest countries by total trade in art== The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960. The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition. {  align=\\"right\\" +Top World Importers in 2010 - !Country !!

The novel centers on an unhappy marriage between a retired soldier, aged 35 (Jacques), and his young teenaged bride, Fernanade. The novel is the first by Sand to be named after a male character. While previously, her novels had focused on female experiences within marriage, in Jacques, she turns her attention to describing a male partner in a marriage. The novel details how he feels about ongoing events in often painful detail. It has been suggested by some critics that the character of Jacques later reappears as an unnamed fellow traveler in Sand's fictionalized travel account Letters of a Voyager. ==Plot== Jacques and Fernanda are newlyweds, but they are mismatched in many ways, not least in age and education. Both enter into marriage with high hopes, but these are quickly dashed by a massive quarrel early on in the book, which becomes an important turning point in the book. The means of reconciliation used by the two characters are very different. After the fight, Fernande attempts to mend the rift by begging and pleading, but Jacques responds with disgust. Following this, Jacques invites his sister Sylvia and her companion Octave to stay with the couple as guests. Octave and Fernande fall in love. Faced with no choice but to challenge Octave to a duel or concede the marriage, Jacques can find no suitable alternative. He decides to disappear into a crevice in the Alps, never to return. ==Themes== While the novel never provides an explanation for the dissolution of Jacques and Fernande's marriage, the novel highlights that differences in how the couple express emotion and how they see the world. The inability of the couple to comprehend one other may be what causes their relationship, although the question is left open. However, Sand also highlights the social aspects of this problem by emphasizing the youth of Ferndande, who is married by her family as a teenager, and the impossibility of the couple's divorcing under Napoleonic law. Like many of Sand's novels, Jacques argued in favor of the education and independence of 19th century women and against a view of marriage in which the husband dominated the wife legally. Unlike her prior novels, Jacques depicts misunderstandings in a marriage not arranged out of convenience but originally based on love. Thus the novelist tackles a new topic in this exploration of men and women's intimate relations, differences in communication. ==Relation to Other Works== Jacques is the third of Sand's novels. Many critics have compared it to her first two works, Indiana and Valentine due to their specific interest in women's equality, including the legal rights, education, and familial roles of women. Sand's early career focused on these issues extensively. While these were controversial topics, writing about them also helped build her reputation and attracted a wide following of readers who were interested in these themes. ==References * Novel online (in French) * George Sand: Some Aspects of Her Life and Writings Category:Novels by George Sand Category:1833 French novels ","title":"Jacques (novel)"},{"id":"35853315","text":"Peter Read may refer to: *Peter Read (publisher), see Music of Arkansas *Peter Read (boxer) *Peter Read, historian Professor at the Australian National University, was the first to use the phrase \\"stolen generation\\" ==See also== *Peter Reade (born 1939), British former sailor *Peter Reed (disambiguation) *Peter Reid (disambiguation) ","title":"Peter Read"},{"id":"35853321","text":"Interhill Logging Sdn.

Optimal weighting methods reflect the nature of the specific network, conform to the designer's objectives and aim at minimizing information loss. == Background == Bipartite networks are a particular class of complex networks, whose nodes are divided into two sets X and Y, and only connections between two nodes in different sets are allowed. For the convenience of directly showing the relation structure among a particular set of nodes, bipartite networks are usually compressed by one-mode projection. This means that the ensuing network contains nodes of only either of the two sets, and two X (or, alternatively, Y) nodes are connected only if when they have at least one common neighboring Y (or, alternatively, X) node. \\"Possible projections of a simple bipartite network\\" The simplest method involves projecting the bipartite network onto an unweighted network, without taking into account the topology of the network or the frequency of sharing a connection to the elements of the opposing set. Since bipartite networks with largely different structures can have exactly the same one-mode representation in this case, a lucid illustration of the original network topology usually requires the use of some weighting method. == Possible weighting methods == According to the designer's needs and the topological properties of the given network, several different weighting methods have been proposed. Since the redistribution of weights is found to have a strong effect on the community structure (especially in dense networks), the methodological choice must be made with care.\\"The effect of weight on community structure of networks\\" by Ying Fan, Menghui Li, Peng Zhang, Jinshan Wu, Zengru Di in PHYSICA A 378 (2007) 583–590 # Simple weighting. Simple weighting means that edges are weighted directly by the number of times the common association is repeated. (This is the method applied in the attached graph on the right.) This approach works fine for a wide range of settings such as molecular gastronomy or most social networks. However, it can be misleading if the marginal impact of one additional association is not fixed but dependent on some characteristics of the network (e.g. on the original weight between the respective nodes). This can be the case for example in scientific collaborations as pointed out by Fan et al.. # Hyperbolic weighting. In the common case of decreasing marginal contribution of additional links to a node, the use of simple weighting might not be very illuminating. For example, in scientific collaboration networks, two scientists whose names appear on a paper together with many other coauthors are expected to know one another less than two who were the sole authors of a paper.\\"Scientific collaboration networks. II. Shortest paths, weighted networks, and centrality\\" by M. E. J. Newman in PHYSICAL REVIEW E, vol. 64, 016132 (2001) In order to account for this so-called saturation effect, it has been proposed to weight edges inversely according to the number of common affiliations in the neighboring set. This is most easily achieved by introducing a scaling factor 1/(n - 1) onto the simple count, which weakens the link between nodes with more popular common matches. # Weighting based on resource allocation. With simple and hyperbolic weighting, the projected adjacency matrix is always set to be symmetrical, which implies that a link between two projected nodes carries the same weight for both vertices. Moreover, information contained by edges whose \\"target\\" nodes are of degree 1 in the original network will be lost in the projection, which can have grievous consequences in some real networks with a lot of independent edge sets. To overcome these shortcomings, Zhou et al. has proposed a weighting method that is based on assuming that a certain amount of resource is associated with each node in the projection, and the directional weight w_ij represents the proportion of the resource node j would like to distribute to node i. Resource allocation is based on the bipartite graph, involves equal distribution across neighbors and consists of two steps: first from the projected set to the non-projected set, and then back. Numerical simulations indicate that this projecting method can perform remarkably than some widely used method (such as collaborative filtering) for personal recommendation purposes. == Some notable applications == * Flavor network and the principles of food pairing * Scientific collaboration network \\"Why social networks are different from other types of networks\\" by Newman and Park in PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 036122 (2003) * Corporate elite network \\"The Small World of the American Corporate Elite, 1982-2001\\" by Davis, Yoo and Baker in STRATEGIC ORGANIZATION August 2003 vol. 1 no. 3 301-326 * Human disease network \\"The human disease network\\" by Kwang-Il Goh, Michael E.

Valentine, who disagrees with the scientific consensus on global warming, interviewed scientists about the validity of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth and the facts presented within. The scientists he interviews deny that there is a consensus on the issue of global warming or climate change. The film argues that global warming proponents keep changing its label, basing their argument on what Valentine says is shaky scientific ground. ==Synopsis== An Inconsistent Truth is Valentine's investigation into man-made global warming. The title alludes to Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Valentine talks with scientists and politicians who reject the scientific consensus on climate change, and explores the culture of the global warming movement; often in a satirical way. The topics covered include being called a pollutant, Gore's contention that polar bears are dying off and the global ice is melting, among others. Valentine also delves into the motivation behind the movement. ==Production== The film features a 1985 Mercedes 300D, named Bennie the BioBenz, Valentine bought with the purpose of running it on biodiesel. Valentine makes his own biodiesel by collecting used vegetable oil and running it through a machine called the Fuelmeister. Bennie the BioBenz underwent a facelift prior to its close-ups in the movie from Vogely & Todd Paint and Body Shop in Nashville, TN. When Valentine bought Bennie it had a crushed right front fender, and then the car delivery service damaged Bennie's hood. Valentine purchased a used fender from a junk dealer in Memphis, and the hood was replaced. The car was stripped down to the metal and repainted as well as having its interior restored. Additionally, the famous Mercedes \\"Turbo Diesel\\" badging on the car was replaced with a custom \\"Biodiesel\\" badge. Bennie can be seen throughout the movie and can be seen on some of the movie's posters. ==Theatrical release== An Inconsistent Truth held its world premiere in Nashville at the Regal Hollywood 27 Theaters on January 26, 2012. It opened to the public the next night and was the top-grossing movie per screen in the country for its first two weeks, grossing a total of US$20,733 on the one screen it played on. When it closed , it had made a total of $69,394. On September 23, 2013, the film was released on DVD. , it is the 27th top-grossing English-language nature documentary of all time at the box office. ==Soundtrack== The movie score was written and performed by Michael Thomas Benoit. The soundtrack features original music from Pacific Heat, Willie B. Green, Chadwick Station, and Phil Valentine & The Heartthrobs. Green's \\"Dirt People\\" plays as the end credits roll. ==People appearing in the film== * Phil Valentine, narrator * Newt Gingrich * Jim DeMint * James Inhofe * Fred Singer * John Christy * Roy Spencer * Ken Green * Greg Walden * Steven Milloy * Drew Johnson ==Reception== John Beifuss, writing in The Commercial Appeal noted the tiny release of the film, but still found the opening box office to be \\"extraordinarily impressive.\\" He observed similarities between the film's producer, Phil Valentine, and another documentary filmmaker, Michael Moore, particularly the way in which Valentine hounds Al Gore for an interview. Film critic Prairie Miller was skeptical of the film's premise: that Al Gore's environmental activism is motivated by a desire for money and power. She criticized the direction of Shayne Edwards, writing that it's \\"really a case of wagging the dog with smug narrator Phil Valentine calling the shots.\\" She also faults Valentine for not disclosing his affiliations with conservative causes.An Inconsistent Truth Movie Review: Tea Party Tirade Gores Al ==See also== * An Inconvenient Truth...Or Convenient Fiction? * Global warming controversy ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Official website * An Inconsistent Truth on Imdb Category:2012 films Category:Documentary films about global warming Category:Documentary films about conspiracy theories Category:Environmentally skeptical films Category:Climate change denial ","title":"An Inconsistent Truth"},{"id":"35853523","text":"Falsopseudomoxia tertia is a species of beetle in the family Mordellidae, the only species in the genus Falsopseudomoxia. ==References== Category:Mordellidae Category:Beetles described in 1965 ","title":"Falsopseudomoxia"},{"id":"35853538","text":"Orionides is a clade of tetanuran theropod dinosaurs from the Middle Jurassic to the Present. The clade includes most theropod dinosaurs, including birds. ==Relationships== Although many phylogenetic analyses found basal tetanurans that were outside both Megalosauroidea and Avetheropoda, the core dichotomy was named only in 2012. Carrano, Benson and Sampson (2012) named that clade Orionides, and defined it as the node comprising Megalosauroidea, Avetheropoda, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants. In 2015, Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus clarified this definition, specifying it as the least inclusive clade including Allosaurus fragilis, Megalosaurus bucklandii, and Passer domesticus. The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis published by Zanno and Makovicky in 2013. ==Range== Large, predatory spinosaurids and allosaurids flourished during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, especially in Gondwana, but seem to have died out before the end of the Cretaceous, possibly due to competition from abelisaurid ceratosaurs and tyrannosaurid coelurosaurs. The diverse coelurosaurs persisted until the end of the Mesozoic Era, when all except for crown clade avians died out. Modern birds are the only living representatives of the clade Tetanurae. ==Etymology== The clade name \\"Orionides\\" was first established by Matthew T. Carrano, Roger B. J. Benson and Scott D. Sampson in 2012. It is derived from Orion, the giant hunter of Greek mythology in references to the large size and carnivorism of basal orionidans.

Musa Kesedžija is on the left. Musa Kesedžija, Musa Arbanas (Serbian and , ), also described as Musa the Robber, Musa the Outlaw, Musa the Highwayman or Musa the Beheader, is a popular legendary villain of Serbian epic poetry and Bulgarian and Macedonian folklore. He is most famous as a rival of Prince Marko (Serbian: Марко Краљевић), a hero of Serbian and South Slavic folklore. In the poem Musa is an Albanian highwayman who confronts Prince Marko, a vassal of the Sultan, at the Kačanik Gorge, today in modern Kosovo. == Musa Kesedžija in literature and arts  Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija === Musa Kesedžija first appeared in the poem Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija, which was recorded for the first time in Sremski Karlovci and published in 1815 by Vuk Karadžić. Karadžić recorded the poem sung by Tešan Podrugović. Musa had three hearts which is a sign of exceptional heroism in Serbian epic poetry. Because of his three hearts, Musa can be seen as an anthropomorphised descendant of chthonic monsters, as their anthropomorphosis can be reflected in the multiplication of body parts. === Other literature works === Petar I Petrović-Njegoš (1747–1830) mentions Musa and Marko Kraljević in his song The Sons of Ivan-bey (), which was after his death published first in 1835 and then by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš in his 1845 song collection Serbian Mirror (). Musa appears in Macedonian folklore as a symbol of the oppressive Ottoman government. The song about Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija also exists in Bulgarian literature as an epic retelling (). In 1972 Werner Cohn published a gypsy story about Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija, which is also in the form of a retelling of another epic song — Marko Kraljević and Djemo the Monuntaineer. In Zakarpattia the epic poetry about Marko Kraljević and Musa Kesedžija has been modified into stories connected with the Kosovo battle. == Historical background  Historical persons === The epic villain Musa Kesedžija is based on actual historical people. According to some authors he is the result of merging several historical people including Musa Çelebi son of Bayezid I and Musa (Teodor II Muzaka) from the Muzaka Albanian noble family with whom Marko had dispute over Kostur, modern day Kastoria. Jovan Tomić thinks that Musa Kesedžija is based on another historical person, on the supporter of Jegen Osman Pasha who has been transformed into another epic hero — Djemo the Mountaineer () in Serbian epic poetry. The epic poetry describes Djemo as Kesedžija's brother. === Historical events === Actual historical events do not support a plot in which Prince Marko (who died in 1395) killed Musa Çelebi (died in 1413) or Moisi Arianit Golemi (died in 1465). John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. emphasized that Sandalj Hranić should have been the epic hero who fought and killed Kesedžija rather than Marko Kraljević, because it was Hranić who significantly contributed to the death of Musa Çelebi. == See also == * Korun Kesedžija == References  Sources == * Category:Characters in Serbian epic poetry Category:Bulgarian folklore Category:Fictional outlaws Category:North Macedonia folklore ","title":"Musa Kesedžija"},{"id":"35853548","text":"Jetmore Municipal Airport is a city-owned airport seven miles south of Jetmore, a city in Hodgeman County, Kansas. == Facilities and == The airport covers 1,181 acres (478 ha) at an elevation of 2,466 feet (752 m).

Aged two, his parents took him to Limerick, where he grew up. From there, he emigrated with his parents in 1859 on the ship Tornado to Auckland. He assisted his father on his farm at Mangapai and was a reporter on the Auckland Weekly News. In 1864 he went to the West Coast goldfields of the South Island, working as a miner at the Greenstone, Red Jack's Gully, and other districts of the Grey. On the opening of the Thames as a goldfield, McCullough returned to Auckland, and 'tried his luck' on the new field, acting as a miner and mine manager for several years, and subsequently joining the Times as mining reporter. A few years later he became proprietor of the Thames Star. McCullough held many official positions in the Thames District, including mayor (1878–1879) and councillor (1881–1882), president of the Hospital Board, chairman of the Harbour Board, and chairman of the Board of Governors of the High School. McCullough purchased the printing business of William Arthur, in Auckland. In 1896 he attended the Burns Centenary Celebration at Duntroon, Scotland, as a delegate from the Auckland Burns Club. As a Freemason, McCullough held the office of right worthy provincial grand master of the North Island, Scotch Constitution, he succeeded Frederick Whitaker in this position. McCullough was called to the Legislative Council by the Ballance Ministry on 15 October 1892 as the representative of a goldfields district. He served for one seven-year term until 14 October 1899 and was not reappointed. McCullough died on 22 July 1925 in Thames. He had been retired for five years. ==References== *alt= This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Category:1843 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Members of the New Zealand Legislative Council Category:Irish emigrants to New Zealand (before 1923) Category:Mayors of Thames ","title":"William McCullough (politician)"},{"id":"35853615","text":"Gymnostena holosericea is a species of beetle in the family Mordellidae, the only species in the genus Gymnostena. ==References== Category:Mordellidae ","title":"Gymnostena"},{"id":"35853647","text":"Calyce cardinalis is a species of beetle in the Calyce genus.

In either prokaryotes or mitochondria they are localized to the outer membrane, and have been shown to bind and transport dicarboxylic tetrapyrrole intermediates of the haem biosynthetic pathway. They are associated with the major outer membrane porins (in prokaryotes) and with the voltage-dependent anion channel (in mitochondria). TspO of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is involved in signal transduction, functioning as a negative regulator of the expression of some photosynthesis genes (PpsR/AppA repressor/antirepressor regulon). This down-regulation is believed to be in response to oxygen levels. TspO works through (or modulates) the PpsR/AppA system and acts upstream of the site of action of these regulatory proteins. It has been suggested that the TspO regulatory pathway works by regulating the efflux of certain tetrapyrrole intermediates of the haem/bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways in response to the availability of molecular oxygen, thereby causing the accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate that serves as a corepressor for the regulated genes. A homologue of the TspO protein in Sinorhizobium meliloti is involved in regulating expression of the ndi locus in response to stress conditions. In animals, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is a mitochondrial protein (located in the outer mitochondrial membrane) characterised by its ability to bind with nanomolar affinity to a variety of benzodiazepine-like drugs, as well as to dicarboxylic tetrapyrrole intermediates of the haem biosynthetic pathway. Depending upon the tissue, it was shown to be involved in steroidogenesis, haem biosynthesis, apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation, mitochondrial respiratory control, and immune and stress response, but the precise function of the PBR remains unclear. The role of PBR in the regulation of cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate- determining step in steroid biosynthesis, has been studied in detail. PBR is required for the binding, uptake and release, upon ligand activation, of the substrate cholesterol. PBR forms a multimeric complex with the voltage- dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide carrier. Molecular modeling of PBR suggested that it might function as a channel for cholesterol. Indeed, cholesterol uptake and transport by bacterial cells was induced upon PBR expression. Mutagenesis studies identified a cholesterol recognition/interaction motif (CRAC) in the cytoplasmic C terminus of PBR. In complementation experiments, rat PBR (pk18) protein functionally substitutes for its homologue TspO in R. sphaeroides, negatively affecting transcription of specific photosynthesis genes. This suggests that PBR may function as an oxygen sensor, transducing an oxygen-triggered signal leading to an adaptive cellular response. These observations suggest that fundamental aspects of this receptor and the downstream signal transduction pathway are conserved in bacteria and higher eukaryotic mitochondria. The alpha-3 subdivision of the purple bacteria is considered to be a likely source of the endosymbiont that ultimately gave rise to the mitochondrion. Therefore, it is possible that the mammalian PBR remains both evolutionarily and functionally related to the TspO of R. sphaeroides. ==References== Category:Protein families Category:Signal transduction Category:Transmembrane proteins ","title":"Tryptophan-rich sensory protein"},{"id":"35853791","text":"Paramordellistena exilis is a species of beetle in the family Mordellidae, the only species in the genus Paramordellistena. ==References== Category:Mordellidae Category:Beetles described in 1848 ","title":"Paramordellistena"},{"id":"35853800","text":"Phunginus apicalis is a species of beetle in the family Mordellidae, the only species in the genus Phunginus. ==References== Category:Mordellidae Category:Beetles described in 1922 ","title":"Phunginus"},{"id":"35853811","text":"Pselaphokentron is a genus of beetles in the family Mordellidae, containing the following species: * Pselaphokentron aculeatum Franciscolo, 1990 * Pselaphokentron bradypygum Franciscolo, 1955 * Pselaphokentron brunneipenne Ermisch, 1969 ==References== Category:Mordellidae ","title":"Pselaphokentron"},{"id":"35853817","text":"Pseudodellamora is a genus of beetles in the family Mordellidae, containing the following species: * Pseudodellamora brevicollis (Emery, 1876) * Pseudodellamora championi (Schilsky, 1899) * Pseudodellamora distinguenda Ermisch, 1963 * Pseudodellamora grossepalpalis Ermisch, 1942 ==References== Category:Mordellidae ","title":"Pseudodellamora"},{"id":"35853837","text":"Passandrella is a genus of beetles in the family Passandridae.Passandridae at insects.tamu.edu. ==Species== * Passandrella tuberculata Burckhardt & Slipinski * Passandrella visenda Grouvelle, 1916 ==References== Category:Passandridae ","title":"Passandrella"},{"id":"35853840","text":"Raymordella is a genus of beetles in the family Mordellidae, containing the following species: *Subgenus Raymordella Franciscolo, 1956 :*Raymordella adusta Franciscolo, 1967 :*Raymordella ambigua Franciscolo, 1956 :*Raymordella transversalis Franciscolo, 1967 *Subgenus Raymordellina Franciscolo, 1967 :*Raymordella xanthosoma Franciscolo, 1967 ==References== Category:Mordellidae ","title":"Raymordella"},{"id":"35853843","text":"Pseudodellamora brevicollis is a beetle in the genus Pseudodellamora of the family Mordellidae.

After returning to the US, and to music, a year and a half later. Stern is a tenor with a wide vocal range and he performs a variety of musical styles including opera, cabaret, jazz, klezmer, bohemian, Balkan music, and many others. As an opera singer, Stern has appeared in over thirty operas including leading roles in La Boheme (Schaunard), Die Fledermaus (Dr. Falke), Gianni Schicchi (Gerardo), Carmen (El Dancairo), and the American Premiere of The Beggar’s Opera (Ben Lockit).

Toulon's dam, Green Rock was a daughter of Infra Green, who won Prix Ganay and produced good winners including Infrasonic (Queen's Vase) and Greensmith (second in the St James's Palace Stakes). The colt was sent into training with André Fabre at Chantilly. He was ridden in all but his first and last races European races by the veteran Irish jockey Pat Eddery. ==Racing career1990: two-year-old season=== Toulon did not appear on a racecourse until the late autumn of 1990. On 25 October he ran against two opponents in the Prix de Sablonville over 1800m at Longchamp. Ridden for the only time by Cash Asmussen, he won by a neck from Sarajoudin. ===1991: three- year-old season=== On his first appearance of 1991, Toulon was stepped up in class for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe at Longchamp, in which he was ridden for the first time by Pat Eddery. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Suave Dancer who won comfortably by four lengths, with Toulon in third. With Suave Dancer being aimed at the Prix du Jockey Club, Toulon's connections targeted The Derby and sent him to England for the Chester Vase on 7 May. Eddery held up the French-trained colt for a late challenge, but struggled to obtain a clear run and was badly hampered before Toulon broke clear to win easily from Luchiroverte. Toulon's Chester win saw him regarded as a major contender for the Derby, and Epsom on 5 June, he started 4/1 joint favourite for the race against twelve opponents. He was towards the back of the field from the start and never challenged the leaders, finishing ninth behind Generous. In July, Toulon returned to France to race against older horses in the Prix Maurice de Nieuil at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. Toulon took the lead 200m from the finish and went clear of his opponents before being eased down in the final strides to win by two lengths from the Irish four-year-old Topanoora. On 14 September Toulon started 5/2 favourite for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Eddery restrained Toulon in the early stages before moving him up to challenge the leader Saddler's Hall in the straight. The two colts drew fifteen lengths clear of the rest of the runners, with Toulon being \\"driven out\\" by Eddery to prevail by one and a half lengths. On his final start of the season, Toulon was brought back in distance to face Suave Dancer, Generous and eleven others in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He finished fourth, six lengths behind Suave Dancer, but ahead of important winners including In the Groove, Quest for Fame, Generous, Miss Alleged, Jet Ski Lady and Snurge. ===1992: four-year-old season=== Toulon was well-beaten in all four of his races in 1992. He was third when favourite for the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket and then finished last of the six runners in the Prix Jean de Chaudenay. He ran fourth in the Grand Prix d'Evry in June and was then off the course until autumn. On his final European appearance he was sent to Germany and finished fourth of the five runners in the Preis der Spielbanken des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen at Düsseldorf in October, a race in which he was ridden by Paul Eddery. ===1993: five-year-old season=== In 1993, Toulon was sent to be trained by Bobby Frankel in California. He produced two \\"dismal\\" performances at Santa Anita Park before winning the Jim Murray Memorial Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack ==Stud career== Toulon retired to stud in Ireland where he sired four crops of foals before his death in 1998. Toulon sired some winners of flat races but was much more successful as a National Hunt stallion. His best winners included the steeplechaser Kingscliff (Betfair Chase) and the Irish- trained mare Solerina who won twenty-two races including three runnings of the Hatton's Grace Hurdle. ==Pedigree References == Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:1988 racehorse births Category:Thoroughbred family 3-c Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Toulon (horse)"},{"id":"35853980","text":"Gregg L.

The key event, taking place on the Friday, is the Pride Parade itself which attracts over 250,000 attendees. As of June 2019, it is the largest LGBT Parade in Asia. == Historical background == Gay rights in Israel have progressed drastically since the years following the British Mandate over Palestine, when homosexuality was outlawed. The clause stated that “every man who allowed another man to have intercourse with him risked up to ten years of imprisonment.” In the 1960s, the Israeli Minister of Internal Affairs, Dr. Yosef Burg, described the phrase of \\"homosexual Jews\\" as an oxymoron given the biblical rejection of queer behavior. This provides a framework for the negative perceptions of homosexuality amongst Israeli politicians in the past. The legal code in Israel that once outlawed homosexuality was changed on March 22, 1988, effectively decriminalizing being gay. The terms \\"pride\\" and \\"proud\\", in this context, seem to have been created in Israel, as the result of similarity of words. Since homosexuals were labeled \\"gay\\" in the United States and elsewhere, Hebrew-speaking people noticed the vocal similarity of the English word \\"gay\\" to the Hebrew word \\"גֵאה,\\" pronounced \\"geh-eh\\", which means \\"proud\\". Israeli LGBTQ people soon transformed it to \\"proud\\", which evidently and understandably matched their own perceptions. Thus the labels \\"proud\\" and \\"Pride Parade\\" emerged spontaneously and became international. === Pride Parade === The first event that many consider to be the first 'Pride' event to take place in Israel was a protest in 1979 at Rabin Square. The first time that the Tel Aviv Pride Parade took place was in 1993. The parade assembles and begins at Meir Park, then travels along Bugrashov Street, Ben Yehuda Street and Ben Gurion Boulevard, and culminates in a party in Charles Clore Park on the seafront. There were 200,000 participants reported in 2016, making it one of the largest in the world. The parade is the biggest pride celebration in continental Asia, drawing more than 200,000 people in 2017, approximately 30,000 of them tourists. There were more than 250,000 participants reported in both 2018 and 2019. As of June 2019, it is the largest LGBTQ event in Asia and also the first city in Israel to host a Pride parade. Smaller annual pride parades are also held in Jerusalem, Haifa and Be'er Sheva. ==As a part of Tel Aviv culture== Tel Aviv Pride 2010 Tel Aviv Pride 2007 In the early years of the Pride Parade, the majority of participants were politically motivated. Later on, as the Parade grew, people who took part came with the notion that the Parade should focus on LGBT rights, equality and equal representation, and should not be used as a stage for radical politics, which are not accepted by most of the Parade's participants. Gradually, the Parade came to be less political due to the scale and diversity of participation. In recent years, the Parade's reputation for inclusiveness, along with Tel Aviv's world-class status as a gay-friendly destination and a top party city, has attracted more than 100,000 participants, many of them from around the world. By 2000, the Parade had evolved from being a political demonstration and became more of a social- entertainment event and street celebration. The eleventh Tel Aviv Pride Parade, which took place in 2008, was accompanied by the opening of the LGBT Centre in Tel Aviv. This is the first municipal gay centre in Israel, whose purpose is to provide services specifically for members of the city's LGBT community such as health care, cultural events, meetings of different LGBT groups, a coffee shop, and many others. During the 2009 Pride Parade, which coincided with the centennial celebration of Tel Aviv's historic establishment as a city, five same-sex couples got married in what was called \\"the wedding of the century\\" by the Israeli celebrity Gal Uchovsky. The parade on 10 June 2011 grew to an estimated 100,000 participants and included official representatives of LGBT groups from global companies such as Google and Microsoft. (Tel Aviv boasts one of the largest concentrations of hi-tech companies of any city in the world.) In 2012, the parade attracted crowds exceeding 100,000, making it again the largest gay pride event in the Middle East and Asia. The event is advertised all around the world by the Israeli Tourism Ministry, marking the city of Tel Aviv as \\"the\\" premiere LGBT tourism destination. For 2014, with an anticipated parade attendance of 150,000, a decision was made to move the after-parade beach party from Gordon Beach to Charles Clore Park. The event was hosted by Israeli actress/supermodel Moran Attias, with performances by Dana International, Mei Feingold, and Ninet. == Criticism of the Parade == In Israel, LGBT activist groups have also criticized the Ministry of Tourism for disproportionately allocating funds to LGBT tourism as opposed to the real LGBT activist organizations. In 2016, the Ministry of Tourism spent $3 million on a campaign that concluded with a press release advertising a rainbow adorned airplane that the Ministry was going to use to transport gay bloggers and journalists to Israel. Meanwhile, Israeli LGBT organizations only receive one tenth of the amount budgeted for this advertisement on a yearly basis. This disproportionate spending angered leaders of the LGBT organizations and caused Chen Arieli and Imri Kalman, who were the co-chairs of The Aguda – Israel's LGBT Task Force, to threaten to cancel the parade. The parade still took place that year, but the main outcome of this threat was that the Ministry of Tourism suspended its budget to attract gay tourism and added separate items to its budget for the LGBT organizations. == Support for the Parade == Proponents of the Pride Parade argue that it is an effective mechanism of integrating the LGBTQ community into Israeli society. While the parade could have resulted in increased homophobia and anti-gay sentiment, it has fostered positive intergroup relationships. The parade is also supported financially and logistically by the Tel Aviv City Hall. This was the outcome of consistent requests made by Aguda, Israel's LGBT Task Force, in the first five years of the parade's existence. ==See also== * LGBT rights in Israel * LGBT history in Israel * TLVFest LGBT Film Festival * Jerusalem gay pride parade * Haifa Pride ==References * Toi Staff, Over 250,000 revelers flood Tel Aviv for Israel’s biggest ever Gay Pride parade, The Times of Israel, June 8, 2018 * Information regarding Tel Aviv Pride on Gay Tel Aviv Website.

The idea was stated in its general form by the American statistician Morris H. DeGroot; antecedents were articulated by John R. P. French and Frank Harary. The model has been used in physics, computer science and most widely in the theory of social networks. == Setup and the learning process == Take a society of n agents where everybody has an opinion on a subject, represented by a vector of probabilities p(0) = (p_1(0), \\\\dots, p_n(0) ) . Agents obtain no new information based on which they can update their opinions but they communicate with other agents. Links between agents (who knows whom) and the weight they put on each other's opinions is represented by a trust matrix T where T_{ij} is the weight that agent i puts on agent j 's opinion. The trust matrix is thus in a one-to-one relationship with a weighted, directed graph where there is an edge between i and j if and only if T_{ij} > 0 . The trust matrix is stochastic, its rows consists of nonnegative real numbers, with each row summing to 1. Formally, the beliefs are updated in each period as : p(t) = T p(t-1) so the t th period opinions are related to the initial opinions by : p(t) = T^t p(0) == Convergence of beliefs and consensus == An important question is whether beliefs converge to a limit and to each other in the long run. As the trust matrix is stochastic, standard results in Markov chain theory can be used to state conditions under which the limit : p(\\\\infty) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} p(t) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} T^t p(0) exists for any initial beliefs p(0) \\\\in [0, 1]^n . The following cases are treated in Golub and Jackson (2010). === Strongly connected case === If the social network graph (represented by the trust matrix) is strongly connected, convergence of beliefs is equivalent to each of the following properties: * the graph represented by T is aperiodic * there is a unique left eigenvector s of T corresponding to eigenvalue 1 whose entries sum to 1 such that, for every p \\\\in [0, 1]^n , \\\\left( \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} T^t p \\\\right)_i = s \\\\cdot p for every i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n \\\\\\\\} where \\\\cdot denotes the dot product. The equivalence between the last two is a direct consequence from Perron–Frobenius theorem. === General case === It is not necessary to have a strongly connected social network to have convergent beliefs, however, the equality of limiting beliefs does not hold in general. We say that a group of agents C \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n \\\\\\\\} is closed if for any i \\\\in C , T_{ij} > 0 only if j \\\\in C . Beliefs are convergent if and only if every set of nodes (representing individuals) that is strongly connected and closed is also aperiodic. === Consensus === A group C of individuals is said to reach a consensus if p_i(\\\\infty)= p_j(\\\\infty) for any i, j \\\\in C . This means that, as a result of the learning process, in the limit they have the same belief on the subject. With a strongly connected and aperiodic network the whole group reaches a consensus. In general, any strongly connected and closed group C of individuals reaches a consensus for every initial vector of beliefs if and only if it is aperiodic. If, for example, there are two groups satisfying these assumptions, they reach a consensus inside the groups but there is not necessarily a consensus at the society level. == Social influence == Take a strongly connected and aperiodic social network. In this case, the common limiting belief is determined by the initial beliefs through : p(\\\\infty) = s \\\\cdot p(0) where s is the unique unit length left eigenvector of T corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. The vector s shows the weights that agents put on each other's initial beliefs in the consensus limit. Thus, the higher is s_i , the more influence individual i has on the consensus belief. The eigenvector property s = s T implies that : s_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n T_{ji} s_j This means that the influence of i is a weighted average of those agents' influence s_j who pay attention to i , with weights of their level of trust. Hence influential agents are characterized by being trusted by other individuals with high influence. == Examples == These examples appear in Jackson (2008). === Convergence of beliefs === A society with convergent beliefs Consider a three-individual society with the following trust matrix: : T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} Hence the first person weights the beliefs of the other two with equally, while the second listens only to the first, the third only to the second individual. For this social trust structure, the limit exists and equals : \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} T^t p(0) = \\\\left(\\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} T^t\\\\right) p(0) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2/5 & 2/5 & 1/5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2/5 & 2/5 & 1/5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2/5 & 2/5 & 1/5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} p(0) so the influence vector is s = \\\\left( 2/5, 2/5, 1/5 \\\\right) and the consensus belief is 2/5 p_1(0) + 2/5 p_2(0) + 1/5 p_3(0) . In words, independently of the initial beliefs, individuals reach a consensus where the initial belief of the first and the second person has twice as high influence than the third one's. === Non-convergent beliefs === A society with non-convergent beliefs If we change the previous example such that the third person also listens exclusively to the first one, we have the following trust matrix: : T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} In this case for any k \\\\geq 1 we have : T^{2k - 1} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} and : T^{2k} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} so \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} T^t does not exist and beliefs do not converge in the limit. Intuitively, 1 is updating based on 2 and 3's beliefs while 2 and 3 update solely based on 1's belief so they interchange their beliefs in each period. == Asymptotic properties in large societies: wisdom == It is possible to examine the outcome of the DeGroot learning process in large societies, that is, in the n \\\\to \\\\infty limit. Let the subject on which people have opinions be a \\"true state\\" \\\\mu \\\\in [0, 1] . Assume that individuals have independent noisy signals p_i^{(0)}(n) of \\\\mu (now superscript refers to time, the argument to the size of the society). Assume that for all n the trust matrix T(n) is such that the limiting beliefs p_i^{(\\\\infty)}(n) exists independently from the initial beliefs. Then the sequence of societies \\\\left( T(n) \\\\right)_{n = 1}^{\\\\infty} is called wise if : \\\\max_{i \\\\leq n}  p_i^{(\\\\infty)} - \\\\mu  \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\ p\\\\ } 0 where \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\ p\\\\ } denotes convergence in probability. This means that if the society grows without bound, over time they will have a common and accurate belief on the uncertain subject. A necessary and sufficient condition for wisdom can be given with the help of influence vectors. A sequence of societies is wise if and only if : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\max_{i \\\\leq n} s_i(n) = 0 that is, the society is wise precisely when even the most influential individual's influence vanishes in the large society limit.

Frontispice of his book Politicarum dissertationum syntagma, 1608 ==Life== He was born at Itzehoe, Holstein, the son of a tradesman, and educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He went to study at Rostock and Helmstedt in 1616, and in 1617 was in Leiden. After a period at Hamburg, where he encountered in particular Holstenius, he returned to Leiden in 1624, where he received a doctorate in law. Loccenius was recruited by Johan Skytte for Gustavus Adolphus, and went to Sweden. From 1628 to 1642 he taught a humanist and political syllabus as professor skytteanus; from 1634 he also taught Roman law. As librarian also at the University of Uppsala, he received the embassy of Bulstrode Whitelocke, and they discussed English jurists including Francis Bacon and John Selden. ==Works== De jure maritimo et navali, 1652. The De jure maritimo was a commentary on Swedish maritime law as published in the Legisterium Sueciæ. As De jure maritimo et navali it went through a number of editions. The maritime law work of Loccenius was later republished, with works by Franz Stypmann and Reinhold Kuricke, by Johann Gottlieb Heineccius. Latin in Imprints Loccenius wrote in particular on piracy. He was an early author on legal concepts of territorial waters, whose views were quoted long afterwards. As legal antiquarian Loccenius published an edition of the corpus of Swedish provincial law, the Lex Sueo-Gothorum. His Synopsis juris ad leges Sueticas accommodata (1648) was an early example of the 17th-century use of the Decalogue to classify capital crimes. The Lexicon juris Svevo-Gothicae (1651) was a largely linguistic work. Loccenius was given the title Rikshistoriograf in 1651. In the 1650s he moved from the study of Swedish medieval law to writing on the general history of Sweden. He initially minimised the pre-Christian period, and he followed Ericus Olai in arguing that foreign kings were responsible for negative aspects of the history.

Its author was the Freifechter Joachim Meyer. This manual was made for and was dedicated to Meyer's patron Count Palatine Johann Casimir. This fechtbuch builds on his earlier work, a manuscript written in 1560 - the MS A.4°.2, and presents a complex, multi- weapon treatise. Meyer's complete system often marks the end of and the compilation of the German fencing system in the Johannes Liechtenauer tradition.

He succeeded Democratic Representative Mark Critz, whom he defeated in the 2012 election. Prior to serving in Congress, he worked as an attorney. After new congressional district maps were released by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in February 2018, Rothfus became a candidate in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, where he was defeated for re- election by the incumbent from the 18th district, Democrat Conor Lamb. ==Early life and education== Rothfus was born in 1962 in Endicott, New York. He graduated from West Seneca West Senior High School in 1980. He graduated from the State University of New York College at Buffalo with a bachelor's degree in information systems. He later earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School in 1994. ==Law career== For most of his adult life, Rothfus has been a corporate attorney. He was employed by the United States Department of Homeland Security from 2006 to 2007. He has also been a member of the Edgeworth, Pennsylvania zoning board. He serves on the board of directors of the Veterans Leadership Program of Western Pennsylvania. ==U.S. House of Representatives== 113th Congress ===Elections=== ;2010 Rothfus decided to run for Congress in Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In the Republican primary, he defeated U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan 65%–35%. Rothfus challenged Democratic U.S. Congressman Jason Altmire, losing 51%–49%. ;2012 After redistricting, most of the 4th District was merged with the Johnstown-based Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district. Rothfus won the Republican primary unopposed. In the general election, he faced incumbent Democrat Mark Critz, who had defeated incumbent Jason Altmire in the Democratic primary. Rothfus led Critz in fundraising for the second half of 2012. It was a highly competitive election, with outside groups spending nearly $10 million. Rothfus defeated Critz 52%–48%. He took office when the 113th Congress convened on January 3, 2013. ;2014 Rothfus sought a second term in the U.S. House in 2014. He was re-nominated in the May 20 Republican primary and faced Democratic nominee Erin McClelland in the general election. He defeated McClelland 59%–41%, winning a second term. ;2016 Rothfus sought a third term in the U.S. House in 2016. He again faced Democratic candidate Erin McClelland in the general election. He defeated McClelland 62%–38%, winning a third term. ;2018 For his first three terms, Rothfus represented a district stretching from the northwestern suburbs of Pittsburgh to Johnstown. After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out the old congressional map as unconstitutional and replaced it with a map of its own, Rothfus' district was renumbered as the 17th District and reconfigured as a more compact district in the northern and western suburbs of Pittsburgh. Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election for the neighboring 18th District, had his home drawn into the new 17th and filed to run for a full term there on March 20. On paper, the new 17th is far less Republican than its predecessor; President Trump carried the old 12th by 20 points, but would have carried the new 17th by just 2.5 points. In the November 2018 general election, Rothfus was defeated by Lamb. Lamb won 56% of the vote to Rothfus's 44%. The political action committee America First Policies bought advertisements in support of Rothfus's campaign. ===Committee assignments=== * Committee on Financial Services ** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Judiciary Committee === Caucus memberships === * Friends of Wales Caucus ==Political positions== Rothfus, a conservative, was a member of the Republican Study Committee. === Finance === On July 20, 2017, Rothfus introduced H.J.Res.111, which nullifies a rule submitted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. === Healthcare === In early 2017, efforts were made to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Approximately 130 of Rothfus's constituents requested a town hall to discuss their concerns about removed/reduced health coverage. Frustrated citizens sponsored and invited Rothfus to a town hall; he declined. Some of Rothfus's constituents reportedly started a PAC to motivate him to meet with them. On June 3, activists and constituents purportedly frustrated with Rothfus's refusal to host a town hall interrupted a Chamber of Commerce meeting that Rothfus was attending. === Human trafficking === Along with Congressman Juan Vargas (D-CA), Rothfus introduced the \\"Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act\\" (or the FIND Trafficking Act), H.R. 6069. On July 17, 2018, the House passed the S.488, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, which contained the text of the FIND Trafficking Act. The FIND Trafficking Act directs the Comptroller of the Currency to study how virtual currencies can facilitate human trafficking. === Insurance regulation === On September 12, 2018, a bill that Rothfus had introduced, the State Insurance Regulation Preservation Act (H.R. 5059), passed in the U.S. House of Representatives. The legislation would tailor the supervision of the Federal Reserve over holding companies that own thrifts (savings and loans banks). The bill streamlines regulator's approach to insurance savings and loan holding companies (ISLHCs) by enacting several reforms. === LGBT rights === In 2015, he signed onto a resolution which would amend the U.S. Constitution so that only marriages between men and women are legal. Rothfus has a 0 rating from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group. === Natural disasters === In 2013, Rothfus voted against a bill to provide disaster relief funding to victims of Hurricane Sandy. Referring to the bill's funding offsets for the National Flood Insurance Program, he said it was \\"irresponsible to raise an insolvent program's debt ceiling without making reforms.\\" === Refugee crisis === In January 2017, Rothfus issued a statement in support of President Trump's executive order on refugees. In May 2017, Rothfus voted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, including provisions to defund Planned Parenthood. The bill included an exemption for Congress that was later removed, and the MacArthur amendment, which allowed states to opt out of covering preexisting conditions. ==Personal life== Rothfus resides with his wife, Elsie, and their six children in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. He is a survivor of appendix cancer. He and his family attend St. James Roman Catholic Church in Sewickley. ==ReferencesCategory:1962 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Appendix cancer survivors Category:Catholics from New York (state) Category:Catholics from Pennsylvania Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Notre Dame Law School alumni Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:People from Edgeworth, Pennsylvania Category:People from Endicott, New York Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Buffalo State College alumni Category:United States Department of Homeland Security officials ","title":"Keith Rothfus"},{"id":"35854198","text":"A single Amonix 7700 System A technician engaged in field testing an Amonix 7700 System The Alamosa Solar Generating Plant is a 35.3 MWp (30.0 MWAC) concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) power station, the largest in the world when it was completed, in May 2012.

Calvo based on the creepypasta of the same name. The movie had its world release on March 2, 2013 at the Miami International Film Festival and was released to DVD on August 12, 2014. Filming took place Wallingford, Connecticut in April and May 2012, and stars Renee Olstead. ==Plot== Perky blonde teenager Kaitlan (Renee Olstead) has decided to invite over a few of her friends after she finds that her parents are leaving her home alone for the weekend. She's planning for a small, relatively quiet get together with her friends Jenna (Valentina de Angelis) and Rose (Shelby Young), but Kaitlan soon finds that Rose has invited boys to the party, Shane (Guy Wilson) and Jeff (Spencer Daniels). Not wanting to seem uncool, Kaitlan allows the boys to stay and party. Eventually Shane suggests that they play The Midnight Game, where participants confess their deepest fears while performing a strange ritual. Anyone who performs the ritual inaccurately runs the risk of running into the Midnight Man, a terrifying figure that can bring the participants' fears to life. They must carry candles, and if the candle extinguishes then they must relight it in ten seconds or surround themselves instantly with a circle of salt, or the Midnight Man will catch them. The teenagers originally think the game sounds fun and do not take the idea of the ritual seriously, beginning the game gleefully. Nothing happens for the first hour and a half, yet just as the group is starting to become complacent they begin to hear noises, and their candles start to go out. The boys decide to explore upstairs where they can hear unusual sounds, whilst the girls remain downstairs. Jeff and Shane discover a crucifix upstairs which unnerves them, and they are drawn back downstairs by the sound of the girls screaming; they saw a dark figure moving around outside the house. The candles all start to go out, and the group panics. Kaitlan attempts to end the game by turning on the lights, only to find that they do not work even though the power for the house is still running. After some time has passed, they eventually draw a circle of salt around themselves and huddle together, eventually falling asleep. At 3:33 AM the lights turn back on and the group awakes, thinking that the game is over. They do not realise that having failed to relight their candles in ten seconds and drawing the circle of salt well after they needed to, the Midnight Man has won the game. The next morning, Rose awakes to find Jeff is gone. She goes downstairs to the kitchen, and finds that no one knows where Jeff is; Shane assumes that he has gone to basketball practice and texts him, with no response. Jenna, unprovoked, begins to verbally abuse Rose in a bout of sudden anger, accusing her of wanting to steal Shane and always trying to copy her. The others are stunned by Jenna's sudden moodswing, and later she apologises. Shane, Kaitlan and Jenna decide to go for a hike, whilst Rose chooses to stay at the house and take a nap. On the hike, Jenna begins accusing Shane of cheating on her and acts extremely angry for no reason, until her mood suddenly changes and she is abnormally happy, seeing shapes in the clouds that do not exist and skipping along. Meanwhile, back at the house, Rose begins to hear strange noises and hallucinate unnerving things. Eventually, she walks into a room and sees the Midnight Man, a demonic pitch black figure. On the hike, Shane receives a text from Rose begging him to help her, and despite Jenna screaming for no reason when he suggests they go back, he and the others return to the house to find Rose huddled in the kitchen, clutching a knife and having a panic attack from seeing the Midnight Man. Shane coaxes Rose to drop the knife, and as she does Jenna begins panicking and acting paranoid. The group deduces that this must be because of the Midnight Game, and Rose decides to go home. On her way home, Rose starts to hallucinate the Midnight Man again. She sees Jeff at the side of the road and pulls over to talk to him, only to find that he is undead. Rose backs away, and is hit by a car. She then wakes up in the car and realises that this was a hallucination, and decides to go back to the house. Back at the house, Jenna has been growing increasingly panicked and paranoid, hallucinating that Shane cheated on her with Kaitlan. She breaks down, and Shane attempts to comfort her. The group realise that the reason these things are happening to them is because they did not follow the rules of the Midnight Game, and they decide to play again to see if that will end the chain of horrific events. As they begin the game for the second time, Shane recalls a blog he read on the internet about a boy who did not follow the rules of the game and ended up reliving his worst fears over and over until his death, and the theories he has read that people get trapped in an endless cycle of reliving their death over and over. He fears that this will happen to them. As they play the game, the candles blow out and they are unable to relight them. They intend to surround themselves with salt, but accidentally spill the salt, leaving them trapped to face the Midnight Man. Jenna goes upstairs, where she is taunted by a hallucination saying that everyone is against her and is driven to hang herself. Kaitlan is pushed off the balcony by the Midnight Man. Shane receives a text from Jeff stating he is in the basement, and discovers Jeff's corpse in a casket. When he returns to the house, Rose states that \\"he is behind you'\\", and he turns to see the Midnight Man. Shane runs out the house, pursued by the Midnight Man. Suddenly, the clock turns to 3:33, and Shane, Rose, Kaitlan and Jenna all wake up on the floor, still alive. Jeff enters the house with a bottle of wine, and they are shocked to see that he is okay. It seems as though the five have survived the midnight game and that things will return to normal. However, the house is then shown to have been vacated for two years, and a realtor shows a prospective tenant around the house. He is put off buying it when he realizes it is where \\"the incident with the high school kids\\" took place and discusses the incident with the realtor; how four high school students died, and one (Shane) disappeared, believed to have killed the others. As the man and the realtor pull away from the house, Rose's car is shown pulling up to the front as it had at the beginning of the film, and the events from the beginning play out for a few minutes. As the camera pans away from the girls entering the house, Shane's corpse is shown in a pile of leaves across the street, vaguely hinting that the five teenagers are all dead and are stuck in an endless cycle of the Midnight Game. ==Cast== *Renee Olstead as Kaitlan *Shelby Young as Rose *Guy Wilson as Shane *Valentina de Angelis as Jenna *Spencer Daniels as Jeff *Robert Romanus as Derrick ==Release== The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay/Starz on August 12, 2014. ==Critical reception== The Midnight Game has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Fangoria gave the film two and a half out of four skulls, writing \\"THE MIDNIGHT GAME could probably delve a little deeper into its characters’ hauntings/psychotic episodes and even add a few more visceral scares throughout, but Calvo's ability to create atmosphere and build suspense lends welcome dimension to a film that could also have easily devolved into a series of shock cuts and big bangs—and a new blade on a vintage saw is rarely a bad thing.\\" Bloody Disgusting commented that while some of the film was \\"generic\\" it was also enjoyable. HorrorTalk.com gave the film a mostly review, complimenting the film's competent direction, cinematography, and acting, but criticized the film's climax as being too heavy-handed. FilmReel.com gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"For fans of various creepy pasta stories, this will be a worthwhile film.

He started at school at the age of 12. He works as an information officer for UK Athletics. He wrote a book about his marathon performance in Greece in a book titled \\"The Road to Athens\\". () He was invited to start the Athens Classic Marathon in 2002. == Athletics career == He joined the Coventry Godiva Harriers at the age of fourteen. In 1964, he ran his first marathon, in Port Talbot, finishing second in a time of 2:19:29. In 1965, he won the Amateur Athletic Association of England title in the marathon, held in Port Talbot, beating nearest rival Brian Kilby by over 40 seconds. In 1966, he represented England and won silver medal in the Commonwealth Games marathon, finishing 5 seconds behind Scotland's Jim Alder. In 1968, he competed in the marathon at the Olympics, finishing in fifth. He also medalled for a second and final time at the AAA Marathon Championships in Cwmbran, losing out on the title by 15 seconds. Later that year he ran his personal best for the marathon distance while winning at the Fukuoka Marathon, running 2:10:48, a time which was just a minute outside the world record (which had been set on the same course a year previously) at the time, and was a new European record. To date he is still the only Briton to have won the Fukuoka Marathon. In 1969, he ran in the Athens Classic Marathon, which is run over the same course as the original marathon run by Pheidippides. He set a course record, clocking 2:11:07, which was not broken until 2004, when Stefano Baldini broke the record. He also raced in the CAU (Counties Athletics Union) 20 Miles Championships, winning the title. In 1970, he won the Midland Counties 10,000 metres title. He also won the Lake Biwa Marathon that year, setting a new course record in 2:13:46. He represented England in the marathon, at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1972, he won the CAU 20 Miles Championships again, running 1:39:01, setting a British record. He currently holds the 20 miles British National, British Domestic and British All-Comers record for times set during a race over that distance, although faster intermediate marks have been set in races over longer distances. Adcocks ran 10 marathons under 2:20. In 17 total marathons, he won 5 times and placed second 5 times. ==References== * Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:English male marathon runners Category:Sportspeople from Coventry Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for England Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics ","title":"Bill Adcocks"},{"id":"35854560","text":"Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America is a non-fiction book by Lillian Faderman chronicling lesbian life in the 20th century.

Faderman wrote that the rises and falls of the social acceptance of lesbianism in the United States coincides with gains and losses in women's economic and political freedom more broadly. She describes the relatively liberated 1920s as a period in which lesbian communities formed and that lesbianism had a certain cachet in some circles, In the 1930s, a social conservatism driven in part by the Great Depression led to a period of greater repression. The 1940s and World War II brought a greater demand for women's skills and talent, which led to a temporary tolerance of female independence and female homosexuality. The post- war period and the McCarthyist conservatism of the 1950s led to mainstream intolerance of homosexuality. McCarthyist purges resulted in lesbians losing their jobs, and raids on their homes and gathering places. One result of this repression was an increase secrecy in the lesbian community, and Faderman credits this secrecy with the development of multiple lesbian subcultures. By the late 1960s, the stigma associated with lesbianism had lessened. She records the lesbian movements of the 1970s as characterized by separatism and a search for ideal community. The 1980s again saw an increase in acceptance, and more lesbians choosing middle class lifestyles, but also a backlash against homosexuality in the wake of the AIDS crisis as the 1990s dawned (and the books was published). The material in the book is drawn from a variety of sources, including \\"memoirs, literary work, personal correspondence, journalism and 186 interviews.\\" The book looks to the nineteenth century to examine the roots of lesbian identities. She explores the romantic friendships of middle-class, and/or college-educated women such as reformer Jane Addams, feminist leader Carrie Chapman Catt, and Bryn Mawr College president M. Carey Thomas, saying that this form of friendship was considered socially acceptable. She asserts that these relationships were primarily emotional and not necessarily sexual. She argues that although the increase in women's sexual freedom since then has benefited lesbians, it has also \\"undercut\\" romantic friendship. ==Reception== Writing in the Los Angeles Times, novelist Francine Prose described Faderman's book as \\"full of facts and wonderful details that readers may not have encountered, things that are a pleasure to learn and that seem valuable to know.\\"Francine Prose, \\"Women Without Men : Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America, By Lillian Faderman\\", Los Angeles Times, June 9, 1991.

The song and the lyrics give inspiration about being depressed without being dark, which gives way to hope and reminisce, like experiencing the first sunset after sorrow or bereavement. == Composition and peripherals == Josh Silver plays the piano to begin the song while Peter Steele sings. The piano section sounds similar to songs featured on another Type O Negative album October Rust, hence the third line of lyrics beginning with the words 'October's Rust.' Kenny Hickey sings the heavier part while he plays the guitar. After that, the song repeats the first two parts again, but with different lyrics during the piano part. Then the song goes to the next section featuring slow, powerful and repeated riffs, sung by Steele. Then during the last quarter of this song, it plays a military-like symphonic tune of emotional riffs that gives an extremely airy feeling to listeners. Hickey sings the last section. On the album version, the final section has an airy ending, followed by a constant line of repeated notes from a synthesizer while alternating between high and low notes in the downward trend, signifying the end of the song with a backmasked message by Steele. The message is from a voicemail left on a friend's answering machine in 1998.

During the 1920s and 1930s, it produced the core of senior maintenance specialists for the Navy’s communication equipment that “paved the way to United States world leadership in electronics.”Chester W. Nimitz, “Introduction,” in Howeth, Linwod S.; History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy; Gov. Printing Office, 1963; ==Background== Although Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated Morse-code radio communication to the U.S. Navy in late 1899, it was two years before the decision was made to adopt this technology. At that time, Chief Electricians James H. Bell and William C. Bean were sent to Europe to examine available equipment and its operation and maintenance, thereby becoming the first radio technicians in the U.S. Navy. The Navy purchased its first communication sets from foreign manufacturers, but these were soon replaced with American products.Howeth, op. cit., Ch. III & IV In the 1905-1916 period, the Navy continually expanded its radio communication capabilities.Howeth, op. cit., Ch. VI – IX Stemming from the time when Navy communications were by flag signals and Ardois night-lights, radio equipment was operated by personnel with a Petty officer rating of Quartermaster. The operators were capable of making minor repairs to the equipment, but major maintenance was by persons with an Electrician rating. The Navy had no formal schools in radio communications; personnel attained the necessary knowledge through self-study and on-the-job training (called “striking for rate””Navy Training and Rating,” Bluejacket’s Manual, U.S. Naval Institute). With war with Germany approaching, the Navy greatly increased its fleet and had major requirements for radio operators. In 1917, two large schools were opened for Morse-code radio operators: one at Harvard University and the other at Mare Island, California. Within a year, about 5,000 students were attending the 4-month operator courses. Some of these students were also given a brief course on equipment maintenance. During World War I (WWI), the Navy operated the largest radio communication system in the world.Howeth, op. cit., Ch. XXV In 1921, twenty years after the Navy began using radio communications, the Petty-officer ratings of Radioman and Electrician's Mate were finally adopted.“Compilation of Enlisted Ratings and Apprenticeships, U.S. Navy, 1775 to 1969,” Naval History and Heritage Command; http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq78-3.htm#anchora === U.S. Naval Radio School at Harvard 1917-1919 === The Navy established a radio school at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in early 1917. With the entry of the United States into World War I, the student body grew exponentially, necessitating the move to a more suitable location. Later that year, the US Naval Radio School was launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where for the remainder of the war it occupied Harvard campus buildings for classrooms and, somewhat controversially, erected a temporary barracks nearby on Cambridge Common. Training focused on raising the student’s Morse Code operating ability, measured at the rate of words per minute. Students were drawn from Naval Reserve stations around the country. A recruit was sent to Harvard upon reaching an aptitude of 10 words per minute; when he improved to 22 words per minute he was graduated and immediately transferred to the fleet. By Armistice in November 1918, enrollment reached its peak at 3,480 men under instruction. With the war over, enrollment dwindled, and in April 1919 the remaining personnel were transferred to the Great Lakes. While enrolled at the school, students lived in dormitories and barracks on campus, while some boarded in local homes. Downtime was spent on excursions around the Boston region as well as socializing with local Cambridge residents in organized settings as well as spontaneously, and occasionally on a romantic basis. ==A central radio maintenance school== In the years just before and during World War I, there were significant advancements in many technologies. One of the most noteworthy was the application of the triode vacuum tube in receivers and transmitters, inaugurating the field of electronics.Johnson, T., Jr., \\"Naval Radio Tube Transmitters,\\" Proc. IRE, vol. 9, no. 5, (May 1921) Recognizing the advantage to the Navy of both using and contributing to technology advancements, Thomas Edison led the Naval Consulting Board in recommending that the U.S. Congress establish a central naval research laboratory, charged with identifying and shepherding state-of-the-art military inventions. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) opened in July 1923, initially with a five-building campus on the east bank of the Potomac River at Bellevue in the District of Columbia.Amato, Ivan; Pushing the Horizon: Seventy-Five Years of High Stakes Science and Technology at the Naval Research Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, 1998, Ch. 1-3; http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content_images/horizon.pdf The Radio Division, headed by Albert H. Taylor, was the first NRL unit to become fully operational. Taylor, who was previously a university professor and had earned a doctorate from the University of Göttingen, realized that highly trained personnel would be needed to maintain the electronic equipment originating at the NRL. Training within the Navy was the responsibility of the Personnel Division of the Bureau of Navigation (BuNav). With urging from Taylor and other NRL officials, BuNav opened the Radio Materiel School (RMS) in 1924. In 1927, a Radio Engineering School (RES) for Warrant Officers was opened and collocated with the RMS.Taylor, A. Hoyt; Radio Reminiscences: A Half Century, Naval Research Laboratory, 1948, pp. 82-83 ===RMS operations=== The RMS occupied space in one of the five initial buildings on the NRL campus and, although not directly under the NRL, it received administrative support from this organization. The mission of the RMS was to train enlisted men in the theory and maintenance of electronic equipment. Entrance required passing a difficult examination and several years of Navy experience in radio hardware. An extensive manual preparing candidate students was published by the NRL This manual included exercises for self-study in mathematics, electrical physics, and basic radio theory, as well as information on the organization and operation of the RMS.”Preparation Required for Candidates, Radio Materiel School,” Naval Research Laboratory, 1928 and about every three years thereafter The six-month curriculum combined theory and hands-on practice, with the students as familiar with a slide rule as with a soldering iron. Lecture topics included advanced algebra, trigonometry, the slide rule, electrical and electronic circuits, communication receivers and transmitters, antennas, and servomechanisms. The laboratories involved experiments related to the lecture topics, use of electronic instruments, and radio communication system maintenance. All formal instruction was by senior Petty Officers or Warrant Officers. As new electronic equipment came from the NRL, it was incorporated in the instruction, often with special lectures and demonstrations by the same scientists who were doing the research and development. Navy students normally held a Petty-officer rating as a Radioman or Electrician’s Mate, and the top graduates were often promoted to Chief Petty Officer. During the initial decade, the RMS had two classes a year with 50 students each; on the average, about 70 percent of the entering students graduated.”Preparation Required for Candidates,” op. cit., 1934 edition In addition to Navy personnel, the RMS had select students from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Marines. Arthur Godfrey, who later became a well-known radio and television entertainer, was a 1929 RMS graduate from the Coast Guard. A student and then instructor in that period was Marine Sergeant William P. Battell; he was later commissioned and, during World War II, served as the Marine Quartermaster General.Schuon, Karl; U.S. Marine Corps Biographical Dictionary, Franklin Watts, 1963 Nelson M. Cooke was a well-known instructor at the RMS. A 1928 RMS graduate, he later studied at the RES and was promoted to Radio Electrician. Further promotion to Chief Radio Electrician came in 1934, and in 1938, he was made a senior instructor in both the RMS and the RES. In this capacity, he wrote the applied mathematics textbook used in these schools; the book was later a highly successful publication of McGraw- Hill.Cooke, Nelson M.; Mathematics for Electricians and Radiomen; McGraw-Hill, 1942 Cooke also devised a special slide rule for radio calculations that was manufactured and sold by Keuffel and Esser.\\"Cooke Radio Slide Rule\\"; http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KEModels/ke4139family.htm ===RMS expansion=== Starting in the mid-1930s, the potential of another major war led to a major increase in Navy strength. To support this, the RMS also enlarged its training of senior-level maintenance personnel; it increased class size and students per class, and new buildings were added on the NRL campus.Amato, op. cit., pp. 53-54 To obtain more student applicants, the requirement for radio experience in the Navy was eliminated. To compensate for this, the course length was increased to eight months and split into two segments. A three-month Primary segment covered mathematics, the slide rule, and introductory electric and electronic circuits; about half the time was spent in laboratories and fabrication shops. Chief Radio Electrician Cooke developed and led the Primary segment. A five-month Secondary or Advanced segment had the advanced lecture topics from the earlier six-month RMS curriculum, but with more laboratory time devoted to communication system and radio direction finder equipment. In this same period, a revolutionary new radio application – later called radar – was emerging. At the NRL Radio Division, target detection and ranging by radio was first demonstrated by Robert M. Page in December 1934,Page, Robert Morris; The Origin of Radar; Doubleday, 1962, p. 66, Buderi, Robert; The Invention That Changed the World, Simon & Schuster, 1996, p. 63, was demonstrated aboard the USS Leary (DD-158) in July 1936, and began to be installed on battleships in 1939, thus beginning a new era in warfare. This technology was highly classified, and the acronym RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) was coined by the Navy for use in unclassified identification; the noun radar quickly followed. Elementary radar was added to the RMS curriculum in 1940. By early 1941, the RMS had increased its capabilities such that about 300 graduates per year might be possible. BuNav, however, was projecting the war- time requirements for radio technicians to be in the thousands. Thus, major changes in the training program were necessary. An aggressive recruiting activity in the civilian population was started in cooperation with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). In this, the requirement of prior Navy experience in radio would be eliminated for new recruits who had a year or more experience as a licensed amateur radio operator or a commercial radio service technician. Such volunteers, after Recruit training (Boot Camp), would be entered into the RMS as a 3rd- or 2nd-class Petty Officer Radioman and without having to pass the admission examination.”Outstanding opportunity for amateurs to serve their country in Class V6 of the Naval Reserve.” QST (ARRL magazine), vol. 26. no. 2 (Feb. 1942) To provide a major increase in training, BuPers directed that another school be opened on Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. To be called the RMS-Treasure Island, this would have an authorized complement of 800 and a curriculum replicating the RMS-Bellevue operation. Led by Lieutenant Commander Wallace J. Miller, the RMS-Bellevue Officer-in-Charge, development started in October 1941.Breckel, Harry F.; “History of Establishment and Operation, Naval Training School (Electronics Materiel), 1941-1945, Treasure Island, San Francisco, California,” U.S. Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1948 At the same time that the RMS-Treasure Island was being planned, the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) started the development of a totally new training program, the Airborne Radio Materiel School (ARMS). To be located on the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the ARMS would be a five-months course, entirely devoted to airborne radar maintenance. Sidney R. Stock, who had earlier founded a university radio and aviation program, was recruited as a Lieutenant Commander to organize this school. The annual output would be 500 Petty Officers rated as Aviation Radiomen. In early 1942, this was transferred to a more secure location, Ward Island, Texas.Stoddard, George K., “Naval Air Technical Training Center, Ward Island, Corpus Christi, Texas, 1942-1944,” Commander’s Summary Report to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel, June 1944 ==WWII Electronics Training Program== With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II, the Navy had a crisis concerning maintenance of electronic equipment. Huge numbers of new ships, submarines, and aircraft were under production or in planning, all loaded with the latest electronics, but, for their vital maintenance, only a few hundred qualified technicians were available or being trained. An ad hoc committee had been formed at the Navy Headquarters to address this problem. The committee included Lieutenant Commander Stock, Lieutenant Commander Wallace, Chief Radio Electrician Cooke, and training specialists from BuNav. On 8 December 1941, William C. Eddy, a medically retired Navy Lieutenant who had earlier started a submarine electronics school, joined the committee and quickly became its leader. (Upon returning to active duty, Eddy was promoted to the rank of Captain in less than three years.)Lange, Henry; “The Eddy Genius,” Four-part series on William Crawford Eddy, The News-Dispatch (Michigan City, Indiana), 25–28 March 1985 The training program that they designed was commonly called the Electronics Training Program (ETP). With Primary and Secondary Schools, the Primary portion would be given by engineering colleges across the Nation, and upgraded portions of the existing RMS would become the ETP Secondary Schools. Admission would be through a stringent classification examination (later commonly called the Eddy Test). Plans for the new activity were approved by BuNav on 7 January 1942, and a prototype Primary School opened in downtown Chicago five days later.”Navy Establishes New Radio School,” Chicago Daily Tribune, 13 Jan. 1942 The ETP was very successful and remained in operation throughout the war, training an estimated 30,000 technicians.Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; Solving the Naval Radar Crisis, Trafford Publishing, 2007, ==Notes== Category:United States Navy schools and training Category:United States Navy in the 20th century ","title":"Radio Materiel School"},{"id":"35854778","text":"Christian Brothers College was established by the Christian Brothers in Carlisle St, Rose Bay, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1935.

He attended Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City, California, and was selected by the Washington Nationals in the first round in the 2012 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut with the Nationals in 2016. His fastball has been clocked as high as . In 2019, as a member of the White Sox, he was named to the MLB All-Star Game and pitched one scoreless inning in a 4–3 victory for the American League. On August 25, 2020, he became the 19th player in White Sox history to throw a no- hitter in a 4–0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Giolito struck out 13 batters with just one walk to become the first White Sox player to toss a no- hitter with 10 or more strikeouts. == Early Life == Giolito was born at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, on July 14, 1994. He grew up in Santa Monica, California. Giolito began playing Tee-ball at the age of 5, and he played Little League Baseball at Santa Monica Little League. He threw his very first pitch the day before his 14th birthday. ==Amateur career== Giolito attended Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. He was part of a Harvard-Westlake baseball team that included Max Fried and Jack Flaherty, with Ethan Katz as their pitching coach. In March 2012, his senior year, Giolito sprained the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, sidelining him for the rest of his high school season. Giolito had committed to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and play for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. Although some thought he was good enough to be selected with the first overall choice of the 2012 MLB draft, concerns about his elbow caused him to fall to the 16th overall selection, where he was picked by the Washington Nationals. ==Professional careerMinor leagues=== Giolito signed with the Nationals on July 13, 2012—thirty seconds before the deadline—to a minor league contract with a $2.925 million signing bonus. By the end of the month, the team had scheduled Tommy John surgery to repair his injured elbow ligament. By the following summer, he made eight starts for the Gulf Coast Nationals of the rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2013 and posted a 2.78 earned run average (ERA). He was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, and allowed one earned run in the 16 innings he pitched. In 2014, Giolito played his first full season of professional baseball with the Hagerstown Suns of the Class A South Atlantic League. He went 10–2 with a 2.20 ERA and 110 strikeouts compared to 28 walks over 20 starts. He was selected as the 2014 South Atlantic League Most Valuable Pitcher and Top Minor League Prospect. He also appeared in the All-Star Futures Game. Giolito began the 2015 season with the Potomac Nationals of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League, and received a midseason promotion to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League. The Nationals assigned Giolito to Harrisburg to start the 2016 season. He received a promotion to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League in July.Syracuse Chiefs pitcher Lucas Giolito wows 'em in Triple-A debut  syracuse.com ===Major leagues=== Washington Nationals Giolito trying out virtual reality with the Washington Nationals in 2016 Spring Training On June 28, 2016, the Nationals added Giolito to their active roster and he made his major league debut that night against the New York Mets. In his debut, he pitched four shutout innings, allowing one hit and two walks, while getting one strikeout. Chicago White Sox On December 7, 2016, the Nationals traded Giolito, Reynaldo López, and Dane Dunning to the Chicago White Sox for Adam Eaton. Giolito began the 2017 season with the Charlotte Knights of the International League.Baseball  Knights pitcher Lucas Giolito working on craft in Charlotte  04.05.17  Charlotte Observer On August 27, 2017, Giolito earned his first MLB victory in a 7–1 White Sox win over the Detroit Tigers. Giolito threw seven scoreless innings yielding only three hits and striking out four Tigers. Giolito finished the season going 3–3 with a 2.38 ERA in 7 starts. The following season, in 2018, he was part of the starting rotation, making 32 starts for the White Sox, going 10–13 with a 6.13 ERA. In innings, he struck out 125 but led the American League in walks (90) and earned runs (118), and was 3rd in the league in hit by pitch (15), 4th in wild pitches (13), and 9th in home runs allowed (27).Lucas Giolito Stats  Baseball-Reference.com In 2018 he had the highest rate of bases on balls per 9 innings pitched in the majors (4.67), and had the highest WHIP among major league pitchers (1.48).Major League Leaderboards » 2018 » Pitchers » Advanced Statistics  FanGraphs BaseballMajor League Leaderboards » 2018 » Pitchers » Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball He also had the worst left on base percentage of all qualifying major league pitchers, stranding only 63.5% of base runners.Major League Leaderboards » 2018 » Pitchers » Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball In 2019, Giolito's third season and second in the White Sox starting rotation, he greatly improved from the previous year as he went on a nine game winning streak after starting the year with a 1–1 record. He pitched his first career shutout on May 23 against the Houston Astros. He was also rewarded AL pitcher of the month for the month of May. On June 30, 2019, Giolito was named as one of the American League pitchers for the 2019 MLB All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection. On September 16, 2019, the White Sox shut down Giolito for the rest of the season due to a mild lat strain in his pitching arm. Giolito finished the season with a 14–9 record, a 3.41 ERA, 228 strikeouts and three complete games over innings in 29 starts. On August 25, 2020, Giolito no-hit the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–0 at Guaranteed Rate Field. He struck out 13 batters and threw 74 of 101 pitches for strikes; a fourth-inning walk to Erik González was the only blemish in an otherwise perfect game. The no-hitter was the 19th in White Sox history, the most recent having been Philip Humber's perfect game on April 21, 2012, and the most recent by a White Sox pitcher at Guaranteed Rate Field having been Mark Buehrle's perfect game on July 23, 2009. That season, Giolito made 12 starts. In those 12 starts, he went 4–3 with an ERA of 3.48, and struck out 97 in innings as the White Sox made the playoffs that season. Giolito made his postseason debut against the Oakland Athletics in game 1 of the Wild Card Series. He pitched 7 innings giving up 2 hits, 1 walk, 1 run, and struck out 8. He even retired the first 18 batters he faced in that game. He picked up the win as the White Sox beat the Athletics with a final score of 4–1. ==Personal== Giolito is the son of actress Lindsay Frost and video game producer Rick Giolito. His grandfather, Warren Frost, was an actor. His brother Casey is also an actor. His uncle, Mark Frost, is a novelist, television screenwriter, and producer, while his other uncle, Scott Frost, is a writer. In December of 2018, Giolito married his high school sweetheart, Ariana Dubelko-Giolito. ==References : Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Baseball players from California Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:American League All-Stars Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Gulf Coast Nationals players Category:Auburn Doubledays players Category:Hagerstown Suns players Category:Potomac Nationals players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Charlotte Knights players Category:Frost family Category:Harvard- Westlake School alumni ","title":"Lucas Giolito"},{"id":"35855164","text":"Asadiyeh (, also Romanized as Āsadīyeh) is a village in Miyandasht Rural District, in the Central District of Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He was born in Kristiania (present-day Oslo, Norway). He was CEO of the trade association from 1920 to 1952. Frank is particularly remembered for his tireless agitation against governmental price controls. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1946, Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, Knight of the Order of the Polar Star and Commander of the Order of Vasa. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Frank was imprisoned in Møllergata 19 from June to July 1941, then in Grini concentration camp from 12 September 1941 to 26 November 1942. He was arrested a third time in June 1944; after a month in Åkebergveien he was incarcerated in Grini from July to August 1944. He had endeavored to keep Norges Handelsstands Forbund from being usurped by the Nazis. His organization was one of forty-three to protest nazification attempts on 15 May 1941, in a letter addressed directly to Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. This protest of the 43 was met with harsh reactions; by 12 June 1941 an arrest order had been issued on Frank's fellow signatory from Norges Handelsstands Forbund, Erling Steen. On 18 June six more protesters were arrested, including Frank.

It is located at the eastern end of Whitecross Street, within the medieval town walls. The area features the Monmouth War Memorial and the controversial, historic Indian Bean Tree. In addition, in 2010, the square was the site of discovery of the first Mesolithic artefacts in Monmouth. St James Square is lined with numerous listed buildings. ==History and location== 1610 map of Monmouth by cartographer John Speed, showing Dixton (East) Gate (marked M) \\"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree.\\" This is the description of St James Square (pictured) in Monmouth, Wales that appeared in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006. The Monmouth War Memorial, which commemorates the fallen of the First and Second World Wars, was the work of sculptor W. Clarke of Llandaff. The monument was installed near the western tip of triangular St James Square in 1921, in front of a mature Catalpa. The Catalpa or Indian Bean Tree, one of the oldest and largest specimens in the United Kingdom, was planted on the square about 1900. The grade II listed cenotaph and tree, with adjacent lawn and flowers, are enclosed by railings. In 2005, the Catalpa was the focus of controversy when the Monmouthshire County Council condemned the tree. Other groups in the community joined together to hire a professional to investigate the tree's condition. Eventually, metal rods were installed to support a number of the tree's branches. St James Square continues to bring the community together. It serves as the site of ceremonies held on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday (link to photograph of ceremony below). While St James Square does not appear on the 1610 map of Monmouth drawn by cartographer John Speed, Dixton Gate (East Gate), just east of the square, is shown on the early 17th-century map (pictured). St James Square is located within the medieval walls of Monmouth. Whitecross Street extends from Church Street eastward, terminating at the roundabout encircling St James Square. On some maps of Monmouth, the eastern segment of Whitecross Street, from its intersection with Monk Street to its termination on the roundabout, is also given the name St James Square. As a consequence, some buildings along that stretch of street have both Whitecross and St James addresses. In addition, St James Street and Old Dixton Road intersect with the roundabout at its eastern aspect. In 2010, during the course of gas main replacement work at St James Square and Wyebridge Street, Mesolithic era artefacts, including flints, were excavated (link to photograph of flints below). This represented the first discovery of Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth. ==The buildings== remembrance poppies next to Monmouth War Memorial in the square, with the Dispensary (to the left) and Ebberley House (behind Catalpa) St James House (pictured below) at 10 St James Square also has an address recorded at Whitecross Street. It is on the north side of the western end of the square. The 18th-century, grade II listed building has a red brick exterior. The three-storey, five-bay house features a tall, arched window above the entrance. The building was part of Monmouth School, used as a boarding house. 12 St James Square is a two-storey, listed building. While the facade is of the 18th century, the original house is believed to be older. The building has a slate roof and stucco exterior. 19 St James Square, Burton House, is an early 19th-century, listed building. The three-storey building has a pebbledash (roughcast) exterior and operates as a guest house. The Dispensary (pictured above and below) in St James Square is also referred to as Cartref. It is recorded as being at 23 St James Square in at least one document. Cartref is a mid-18th-century, Grade II listed building. It is one of 24 blue plaque buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The three-storey, five-bay building features a hipped roof of Welsh slate with spike finials and large brick chimneys. Ebberley House (pictured above and below) is also recorded at 23 St James Square in at least one document. It is a grade II listed building, just to the right of the Dispensary. The record held by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales indicates that a \\"mid 19th century painting shows a pair of double gabled, 17th century houses\\" at the location. The current exterior appears to be of the 19th century, with stucco over brick. The entrance to the left features a round headed doorway with fanlight and six-panelled door. To the right of the entrance, there is a large, tripartite window. Cast iron railings are present. The house now operates as a bed and breakfast. 25 St James Square is an early 19th-century, listed building. It has a three-storey, two-bay elevation and a pedimented doorway. 33 St James Square (pictured below) has an alternate address, 33 Whitecross Street. The grade II listed house is most probably of the 18th century. While the house is three storeys at the front elevation, the rear has a two-storey elevation. There is a circa 1900 canted bay to the right of the entrance, which has a six-panelled door. The Old Nag's Head (pictured above and below) at St James Square and Old Dixton Road is an early 19th- century building which incorporates the remnants of the East Gate, the Dixton Gate. The gate was otherwise demolished and replaced by the turnpike gate on Old Dixton Road. The medieval portion of the tower gate is red sandstone. The half-round tower of unpainted sandstone projects from the north gable of the building. The remaining portion of the inn is painted. The roof is of Welsh slate and there are red brick chimneys. The Dixton Gate or East Gate (pictured below and in map above) at St James Square and Old Dixton Road represents the only standing remains of Monmouth's medieval town walls and gates other than the Monnow Bridge Gatehouse. Listed with Cadw, it is incorporated into The Old Nag's Head as described above. The red sandstone tower gate has a battered base. The Old Toll House or Dixton Gate Turnpike at 16 Old Dixton Road and the square is a listed building. The toll house is positioned on the left side of the road, with its canted end facing toward the street. The early 19th-century turnpike toll house has a Welsh slate roof and is painted. This was replaced by the toll house on New Dixton Road after the new street was laid out in 1837. ==Gallery== File:St James House, Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 648860.jpgSt James House, address also at Whitecross Street File:33 Whitecross Street, Monmouth.jpg33 St James Square, also 33 Whitecross Street File:Whitecross Street, Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 648859.jpg33 St James Square (left), St James House (right) 15 The Old Dispensary HTsmall.jpgThe Dispensary, Cartref, at St James Square File:The Old Dispensary, Monmouth - Geograph-2099249-by- John-Grayson.jpgThe Dispensary (centre) and Ebberley House (right) File:The Old Nag's Head, Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 618238.jpgThe Old Nag's Head from St James Square File:The Old Nag's Head, Monmouth 2.JPGThe Old Nag's Head at Old Dixton Road File:Rear of Nags Head Monmouth showing the stone work of Monmouth's Dixton Gate.JPGDixton Gate (East Gate) at The Old Nag's Head ==See also== * Whitecross Street, Monmouth * Monmouth in the Mesolithic period * Monmouth Town Walls and Defences == References  External links == * Photograph of Remembrance Day at St James Square * Photograph of Mesolithic flints found in St James Square Category:Streets and squares in Monmouth, Wales Category:Archaeological sites in Monmouthshire Category:Stone Age sites in Wales Category:Prehistoric Wales ","title":"St James Square, Monmouth"},{"id":"35855573","text":"Plausible Prejudices: Essays on American Writing is a 1985 collection of essays by Joseph Epstein dealing with literary criticism and other subjects. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews said that \\"his collection of prejudices doesn't add up to a coherent position or a serious argument.\\" Richard Eder of The Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"you wonder at times what he is defending.\\" Chicago Tribune critic Stevenson Swanson said that the book needs more content. ==References== Category:1985 books Category:Essay collections ","title":"Plausible Prejudices"},{"id":"35855575","text":"The Weather Underground organized collectives around the country in an attempt \\"to challenge the state directly in solidarity with Third World liberation movements, particularly the Black Power movement here and the Vietnamese in Southeast Asia.\\" Collectives organized the white working class against imperialism by holding militant demonstrations and engaging in small scale property damage. ==Formation of the Seattle Collective== During the Ave Riots in Seattle's University District on August 10–14, 1969, the women who were participating came together and from this bonding experience, formed \\"the core of the Seattle Weathermen\\". The Ave Riots were part of larger actions around the country protesting the Vietnam War. Rioters in Seattle were also protesting police brutality, but news reports from the time claim that the group was just \\"teenagers looking for trouble.\\" However, less than a week after these Riots, the Seattle Weather Collective was formed. ==Preparing for Chicago's Days of Rage== The first item on the Seattle collective's agenda was to help organize for the Days of Rage that would be in Chicago in October 1969. Members of the Seattle collective produced pamphlets about the Days of Rage in order to raise awareness of the event and encourage people to travel to Chicago to participate. ===Jailbreaks=== Members of the Seattle Collective would visit several high schools a day in an attempt to recruit members and encourage students to travel to Chicago for the Days of Rage. They titled this action jailbreaks, taking over classrooms while one member stood on a desk speaking to the students. Other members would block doorways and telephones so no one of authority could be notified to what was going on. Others would spray paint the group's slogans on the blackboards. ==ROTC attacks== Reserve Officers' Training Corps centers were a popular place for protesting. These offices are where college students are trained for the U.S. military. In May 1970 alone, \\"thirty ROTC buildings were burned or bombed and National Guard units were mobilized on twenty-one campuses in sixteen states.\\" By protesting these offices that prepare officers for war, Weather Underground was protesting an \\"empire [that] feeds on war.\\" ===September 30, 1969=== Female members of the collective stormed the Air Force ROTC office on the University of Washington campus. They \\"spray [painted] walls, throwing ink bombs, and resisting ROTC cadets who tried to detain them\\". The women surprised the ROTC cadets who were chasing them by turning back for a member who had been detained and attacking the men. ===October 02, 1969=== News of the September 30th ROTC attack attracted three hundred people to a rally that preceded the Students for a Democratic Society's first meeting of the year in Seattle. Following several speakers, Susan Stern stood up and declared \\"we're going to smash an ROTC building\\". A group of people jumped up and followed Stern to the University of Washington's Clark Hall where there was an ROTC office. Once again, the group spray painted walls and resisted the cadets trying to stop them. No one was arrested for this action. The University of Washington later banned six non-students who had been present for the action. ===December 01, 1969=== The ROTC office in the University of Washington's Savery Hall was attacked. This was the final straw for the University of Washington, they no longer recognized Students for a Democratic Society as a student organization on their campus. ===January 18, 1970=== On the day before the Seattle Liberation Front's organizing meeting, two members of the Seattle collective, Trim Bissell and his wife Judith were caught planting a bomb under the Air Force ROTC building at the University of Washington. ===April 30, 1970=== President Nixon announced he was sending United States troops into Cambodia. Protests erupted around the country, and Seattle. On the University of Washington campus, ROTC offices were attacked in a similar manner to previous Weather Underground attacks on the ROTC offices and Downtown demonstrators attacked the Boeing Employment Center. ==References== Category:Far-left politics in the United States Category:Guerrilla organizations Category:Weather Underground Category:COINTELPRO targets Category:Defunct American political movements Category:Political violence in the United States Category:History of Seattle Category:Crimes in Washington (state) Category:1969 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Left-wing militant groups in the United States ","title":"Seattle Weather Collective"},{"id":"35855583","text":"Nowzad or Nawzad or Nauzad (Persian: نوزاد) may refer to: * Nawzad, Afghanistan, a small town in Helmand Province, Afghanistan ** Nawzad District, a district in the north of Helmand Province, Afghanistan * Nowzad, Kerman, Iran * Nowzad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran * Nowzad, Kashmar, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran * Nowzad, Darmian, South Khorasan Province, Iran * Nowzad, Sarbisheh, South Khorasan Province, Iran ","title":"Nowzad"},{"id":"35855585","text":"MIAA logo Nebraska–Kearney's colors The University of Nebraska–Kearney Lopers are the sports teams of University of Nebraska at Kearney located in Kearney, Nebraska.

Band members included Dalton Diehl on vocals, piano and guitar, Darren Harms on guitar and Ryan Lytle on the bass guitar. Their first studio album, The Alignment, was released on February 28, 2012, by Sparrow Records, produced by Pete Kipley and Paul Moak. They are best known for their first single, \\"Hurricane\\". It reached No. 4 on Air 1's Top Songs Chart on November 12, 2011. In March 2013 the band launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for an independent EP, The Boxer & The Thief. It was successfully funded and the EP was available in July to backers. On the September 18, 2013, the band announced on their Facebook page that they were parting ways. ==Background== Samestate was formed in 2008 in Olathe, Kansas. Diehl was the impetus for the creation of the band because he was the worship leader at MidAmerica Nazarene University during his sophomore year, which was when he added Harms and Leoni to the band. Diehl said that he began composing songs to perform during meetings at camps and retreats and at places such as Sheridan's Frozen Custard and Chick-fil-A. This caused him to seek out and add the last two members to the band, Lytle and Wyatt, soon after they had formed the trio. The band signed with Sparrow Records in 2011, who released a taster EP called Samestate, a precursor to 2012's The Alignment. The band decided to sign with Sparrow Records instead of remaining independent, citing the talent at Sparrow could help foster their career. ==Tours== The band's first tour began in August 2011. Called \\"So Long Summer\\", it was with a band named Caleb (composed of Caleb and Will Chapman, who are sons of Steven Curtis Chapman). Samestate's second outing was the \\"Rise Up\\" tour with Family Force 5 during March and April 2012.

The pair made their observations independently on 4 December that year (24 November under the Julian calendar then used in England); Horrocks from Carr House, then in the village of Much Hoole, Lancashire, and Crabtree from his home in Broughton, near Manchester. The friends, followers of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self- taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's Rudolphine tables by observation and measurement. In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing the size of the Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy. ==Background== Kepler's De raris mirisque Anni 1631 notice to astronomers of the impending transits of Mercury and Venus, 1631 By the 17th century, two developments allowed for the transits of planets across the face of the Sun to be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits. In 1627, Kepler published his Rudolphine Tables. Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De raris mirisque Anni 1631 which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761. The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected. Although Kepler's calculations indicated that the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers should be prepared to observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean should have been able to view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121 years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas. ===Jeremiah Horrocks=== Jeremiah Horrocks (1618 – 3 January 1641) was born in Lower Lodge, Toxteth Park – now part of Liverpool but at that time a separate town. His father James was a watchmaker, and his mother Mary Aspinwall was from a notable Toxteth Park family. Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade, and it is said that a watchmaker uncle first interested Jeremiah in astronomy. Jeremiah joined Emmanuel College on 11 May 1632 and matriculated as a member of the University of Cambridge on 5 July 1632 as a sizar, which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees. At Cambridge, he would have studied the arts, classical languages, a little geometry, and some traditional astronomy, but not the latest work by Galileo, Tycho Brahe and Kepler. He used his spare time to teach himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking. Horrocks read most of the astronomical treatises of his day, identified their weaknesses, and was suggesting new lines of research by the age of 17. In 1635, he left Cambridge without formally graduating, presumably owing to the cost of the graduation ceremony. After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks returned to his home in Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole. This was probably to become tutor to the children of the Stones family, prosperous haberdashers who lived at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton. Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth.'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p12: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically the properties of the force that became known as gravity. Decades later, Isaac Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to the Moon in Newton's Principia.Newton, Isaac; 'Principia', Book 3, Proposition 35, Scholium ===William Crabtree=== Ivy Cottage, Broughton: the house from which William Crabtree is thought to have made his observation of the transit William Crabtree (1610–1644) was a cloth merchant from Broughton Spout, a hamlet in the township of Broughton near Manchester, which is now part of Salford. The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester – probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School, which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham's School of Music. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers – William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley – and Samuel Foster, Professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London and alumnus of Emmanuel College.\\"Crabtree, William.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, 2008; Retrieved May 10, 2012 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901016.html It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as nos Keplari (we Keplarians). Crabtree's observations had convinced him that, despite their errors, Kepler's Rudolphine Tables were superior to the commonly used Lansberg's tables, and he became one of the first converts to Kepler's new astronomy. By 1637, he had convinced Horrocks of the superiority of the Keplerian system, and, using their own planetary observations, both men made many corrections to Kepler's tables, which Crabtree converted to decimal form. ===Transit of Mercury=== On 29 September 1638, Horrocks wrote to Crabtree about a likely forthcoming transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 (Old Style) which Kepler had not predicted. He explained that he intended to construct what would later be called a helioscope by attaching his telescope to an \\"oblong stick, carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun’s image\\", and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project the image of the Sun. In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus. In October 1639, Horrocks had calculated that transits of Venus occur not singly, but in pairs eight years apart, and realised that the second transit would occur in less than four weeks. He was convinced that a measurement could be made of the apparent diameter of the planet to within a fraction of a second of arc when it was seen as a dull black disk on the face of the Sun, compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as the bright morning star close to the Sun. He wrote to his younger brother and to Crabtree in Broughton, advising them to observe the event on Sunday, 24 November (4 December New Style). To quote Horrocks: \\"The more accurate calculations of Rudolphi very much confirmed my expectations; and I rejoiced exceedingly in the prospect of seeing Venus\\". ==Observation of the transit== Crabtree watching the transit of Venus A.D. 1639 by Ford Madox Brown – one of the Manchester Murals. Crabtree is depicted as an old man although he was only 29 years old when he made the observation. An image of the solar disk Hevelius added to his report, based on Horrocks's description of his observation. The image does not, however, give a true representation of what Horrocks would have seen. Horrocks was concerned that the weather would be unfavourable for the transit as he believed the rare planetary conjunction would produce severe weather: At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened his room and focused the rays of sunlight coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00 pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15 pm, and observed for half an hour until sunset at 3:53 pm. Crabtree made his observations using a similar set-up but had insufficient time to make any measurements, as it was cloudy in Broughton, and thus he only saw the transit briefly. According to Horrocks: \\"Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy ... In a little while, the clouds again obscured the face of the Sun, so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time.\\" Afterwards, he made \\"so rapid a sketch\\" of Venus as it had passed across the Sun's disc, allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1' 3\\", accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size; Horrocks's estimate of 1' 12\\" was less accurate. ==Results== Kepler had found that the distance between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun, and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony, and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way. He had written in 1618, \\"Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres\\". When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets (with the exception of Mars) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun, this being 28 arc seconds. This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true, and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet and the Sun was about 15,000 times its radius. Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles (97 million km), suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed. His figure was much lower than the 93 million miles (150 million km) that the Astronomical Unit is known to be today, but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time. By 1640, William Gascoigne had developed a reticle and a micrometer for his telescope, both of which would have been invaluable to Horrocks. Gascoigne showed them to Crabtree, who told Horrocks about them, and reported back to Gascoigne saying: \\"My friend Mr Horrox professeth, that little Touch I gave him, hath ravished his mind quite from itself, and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement. I beseech you, Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders.\\" Horrocks produced several drafts of a Latin treatise Venus in sole visa (Venus seen on the Sun) based on his observations, which he presumably intended to publish, but he died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, aged 22. ==Legacy== accessdate=5 June 2012 --> Some of the drafts of Venus in Sole Visa were kept by Crabtree, who died in 1644, three years after Horrocks. Their other correspondent, William Gascoigne, died the same year in the Battle of Marston Moor. Horrocks's papers remained with his family for a short time; some were destroyed during the civil war, some were taken to Ireland by a brother, Jonas, and never seen again, and others passed into the collection of antiquarian and astronomer, Christopher Towneley, where they were consulted by Jeremy Shakerley, who wrote three books on astronomy in the mid-17th century. Others were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The manuscripts were widely circulated from the late 1650s although they remained unpublished for many years. The coronation of King Charles II took place on 23 April 1661 (3 May, New Style), the day of a Mercury transit across the Sun. Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens attended the coronation, during which he heard about the Horrocks's manuscript, found in 1659 by John Worthington (Master of Jesus College, Cambridge and alumnus of Emmanuel College, where he was a contemporary of Horrocks), together with some fragments of correspondence with Crabtree. Huygens knew the eminent Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius, and gave him the manuscript copy; Hevelius appended the manuscript to his report on the Mercury transit, Mercurius in sole visus Gedani, published in 1662. The publication of Venus in Sole Visa by Hevelius caused great consternation at the newly founded Royal Society when it was realised that such an elegant and important paper by an Englishman had been neglected in his own country for so long. The mathematician John Wallis, who was a friend of Horrocks at Emmanuel College, and a founder member and leading light of the society, summed up the view of its members when he wrote: > I cannot help being displeased, that this valuable observation, purchasable > with no money, elegantly described and prepared for the press, should have > laid for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should have been found to > take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light > a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our > country's credit and for the advantage of mankind. The Royal Society assumed responsibility for publication of most of the remainder of Horrocks's work as Jeremiae Horroccii Opera Posthuma in 1672–73. The recording of the transit is seen by many as the birth of modern astronomy in Britain. John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three folio volume, Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643. ==Commemorations== thumb Plaque commemorating Crabtree's observation near his home in Broughton During the 19th century there was a revival of interest in Horrocks's and Crabtree's achievement. Rev. A. B. Whatton, who translated Venus in sole visa from Latin, assumed that Horrocks's comment about \\"business of the highest importance which, for these ornamental pursuits, I could not with propriety neglect\\" must have referred to the duties of a curate, although it seems more probable they were his duties as tutor at the house, or perhaps his \\"business\\" was merely to attend the church. The notion of the impoverished curate gained popular traction and in 1874, after much lobbying, a memorial was mounted in Westminster Abbey opposite to that of Newton which reads: > In memory of Jeremiah Horrocks, Curate of Hoole in Lancashire who died on > 3rd of Jan, 1641 in or near his 22nd year. Having in so short a life > detected the long inequality in the mean motion of Jupiter and Saturn > discovered the orbit of the moon to be an ellipse determined the motion of > the lunar apse suggested the physical cause of its revolution and of Venus > which was seen by himself and his friend William Crabtree on Sunday the 24th > of November (O.S.) 1639. This tablet facing the monument of Newton was > raised after the lapse of more than two centuries. Dec. 9, 1874. The Rev. Robert Brickel, Rector of St. Michael's Church, Hoole from 1848–1881, raised money by public subscription in Lancashire, Oxford and Cambridge to fund the creation of a new chancel and sanctuary to the church to be named \\"The Horrocks Chapel\\". The chancel was completed by 1824, and the sanctuary by 1858. The vestry was extended in 1998–1999, and the first window in the north wall, originally installed in 1872, has stained glass roundels commemorating the transits of Venus of 1874 and 2004. There is also a marble tablet commemorating Horrocks. The church clock, contributed by the parishioners as their commemoration of Horrocks, was installed in 1859; the sundial, installed in 1875, has a quotation from Horrocks (\\"Sine Sole Sileo\\") that translates as \\"Without the sun I am silent\\". In 1903 the artist Ford Madox Brown was commissioned to produce the murals known as The Manchester Murals for Manchester Town Hall. The painting entitled Crabtree watching the transit of Venus AD 1639 is a romanticised depiction of Crabtree's observation of the event. On 9 June 2004, the day after the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits occurred as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family at the time he was collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6 June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house. ==NotesReferences== Notes Bibliography * Category:1639 in science 1639 Category:Astrometry Category:Astrological aspects ","title":"1639 transit of Venus"},{"id":"35855849","text":"Kalateh-ye Baluch (, also Romanized as Kalāteh-ye Balūch and Kalateh Balooch; also known as Kalāt-e Balūch and Kalāteh-ye Rokh) is a village in Gazik Rural District, Gazik District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Heliopsis helianthoides is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial growing tall. The toothed leaf blades are oval to triangular or lance-shaped and may be smooth or hairy or rough in texture. The flowers are produced from midsummer to early autumn (fall). The inflorescence contains one to many composite flowerheads. Each head contains yellow ray florets which are generally long. At the center are many yellow to brownish disc florets. The fruit is an achene about long. In the wild, H. helianthoides may be found in wooded areas and tallgrass prairie, and sometimes along roadsides. It is a popular garden plant for moist, fertile soil in full sun. Plants grow stiff and tall, so may require staking. Several cultivars are available with flowers of varying colors and shades. These include 'Summer Sun', 'Golden Plume', and 'Prairie Sunset'. The following cultivars of H. helianthoides var. scabra (\\"rough\\") have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: * 'Benzinggold' * 'Light of Loddon' * 'Sonnenglut' * 'Spitzentänzerin' * 'Waterperry Gold' H. helianthoides ='Helhan' is also a recipient of this award. ==ReferencesPhoto of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 2005 helianthoides Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Heliopsis helianthoides"},{"id":"35855873","text":"Kalateh-ye Baluch or Kalateh-ye Baluch () may refer to: * Kalateh-ye Baluch, Darmian * Kalateh-ye Boluch, Sarbisheh ","title":"Kalateh-ye Baluch"},{"id":"35855889","text":"Kalateh-ye Gavich (, also Romanized as Kalāteh-ye Gāvīch) is a village in Gazik Rural District, Gazik District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

In 2015 24% was renewable, 6% short of the goal. Wind is the predominant generating technology.Final Report of the NYS RPS Annual Performance Report through December 31, 2015 In 2018, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority awarded long-term contracts to 22 utility-scale solar farms, totaling a combined capacity of 646 MW. In 2012, LIPA adopted a Power Purchase Agreement (limited to 50 MW), which will pay $0.22/kWh for solar generation for installations ranging from 50 kW to 20 MW. A $500 to $5000 application fee favors larger power plants represents roughly the first 10 days of generation for a 50 kW to 500 kW system, but less than 2 hours of generation for a 20 MW installation. The term of the agreement is 20 years, and systems must be interconnected to the grid at the 13.2 kV level. Unlike the feed-in tariff programs in many other places, customers pay for their own electricity as if they were not generating any, making this actually a power purchase agreement, and not a feed-in tariff.

The remaining 35 MW is available to systems of all sizes. If fully subscribed in the first year, the average household will pay an estimated $0.44/month to pay for the program, which will generate an estimated 79.4 million kWh/year. Estimated costs are based on an average avoided cost rate of $0.075/kWh, although peak generation costs can exceed $0.22/kWh, eliminating any cost.Feed-in tariff proposal LIPA's total generation capacity, in 2011, was 6,800 MW.Questions as LIPA fails to use Edge program Solar Splash, a solar powered boat race Solar Splash, a solar powered boat race, was held in Buffalo, New York, in 2002. { class= style=\\"text-align:right;\\" +Installed Photovoltaics ! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Year !! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Total (MW) !! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Installed (MW)New York Solar -  2007  15.4  -  2008  21.9  6.5 -  2009  33.9  12 -  2010  55.5  21.6 -  2011  123.8  68.3 -  2012  179.4  55.6 -  2013  240.5  61.1 -  2014  397  147 -  2015  638  241 - 2016 937 186 - 2017 1,038 101 - 2018 1,073 35 (Partial) - 2019 1,571 498 } ==See also== *Wind power in New York *Solar 1 *Solar power in the United States *Renewable energy in the United States ==References *New York City Solar Map *New York Solar Energy Society *New York Solar Energy *Incentives and Policies **Long Island Feed-in tariff (Power Purchase Agreement) **PV Incentive Program Category:Energy in New York (state) Category:Solar power in the United States by state ","title":"Solar power in New York"},{"id":"35855957","text":"Aliabad (, also Romanized as ‘Alīābād) is a village in Tabas-e Masina Rural District, Gazik District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Today the lands house Thunstetten Castle, which is a national landmark of Switzerland. ==HistoryCommandery=== The commandery was established prior to 1210 for the Knights Hospitaller by an unknown benefactor. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the commandery lands grew with donations and purchases from local nobles. At the height of their power, they owned land in Oberaargau, the Bernese Seeland and around Solothurn. They bought vineyards in Twann and rights over village churches in Lotzwil, Ursenbach, Egerkingen, Aetigen, Rohrbach and Waldkirchen (now part of Niederbipp). The commandery was granted limited rights of citizenship by its neighboring cities of Wangen an der Aare (1320) and Bern (starting in 1329). The commandery complex consisted of the commander's house (now the rectory), the 18th-century Church of St. John the Baptist—although the belltower possibly dates from the founding of the commandery—and the monastery building. The commandery at Thunstetten was often under the authority of commander at Münchenbuchsee, though each house would have its own prior. In 1274 Thunstetten was granted its own seal. At the start of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland in 1528, Peter Englisberg, the commander of both houses at the time, supported the secularization of this commandery as well as his own, for which he received a castle as his reward. The lands of the commandery were seized and became the property of the City of Bern.Thunstetten municipal website accessed 17 May 2012 ===Schloss Tunstettin=== Courtyard of Thunstetten Castle The lands of the former commandery were acquired about 1710 by Landvogt Hieronymus von Erlach, who proceeded to have Thunstetten Castle built on its grounds over the next several years. He then had the lands of the estate established by the city as his domain, in exchange for his prior one in Inkwil. The castle is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The castle was built as a country manor house in the Bernese Oberaargau, by the noted architect Joseph Abeille. The castle remained with the Erlach family until 1746. From that year until 1970, it passed through the hands of numerous owners. In 1970 the Stiftung Schloss Thunstetten (Thunstetten Castle Foundation) took over management of the building and grounds. Today rooms in the castle or the entire castle can be rented for events or meetings. ==References== Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:Preceptories of the Knights Hospitaller in Switzerland Category:Buildings and structures in the Canton of Bern Category:1528 disestablishments in Europe Category:16th-century disestablishments in the Old Swiss Confederacy ","title":"Thunstetten Commandery"},{"id":"35856405","text":"David Rosenbaum may refer to: * David Rosenbaum (journalist) (1942–2006), American journalist * David Rosenbaum (soccer) (born 1986), American soccer player ","title":"David Rosenbaum"},{"id":"35856407","text":"David Kramer may refer to: * David Kramer (singer) (born 1951), South African singer, songwriter, playwright and director * David Kramer (soccer) (born 1972), retired American soccer goalkeeper * David Kramer (talent agent) (born 1969), American talent agency executive * David J.

He was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He played college football at Tulsa. Kinne converted from quarterback to wide receiver in 2015 in hopes of making the Eagles roster in 2015, but failed to make the team. He was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL in 2016, and later signed with the Roughriders in June 2016 before moving into coaching. ==Early years== Kinne was born in Mesquite, Texas, a suburb just east of Dallas, to Gary Joe Kinne and Jocelyne Carter. His father was a former standout linebacker at Baylor University and later an assistant coach at Allen High School, Kaufman High School, and was the defensive coordinator at Mesquite High School. In 2003, his father accepted the head coaching job at Canton High School in East Texas, a town about 70 miles east of Dallas. Kinne became the starting quarterback of the Eagle varsity football team as a freshman. In his first game against rival Grand Saline High School, Kinne played well and exhibited a strong arm and good accuracy despite a 20–13 loss. It would be a rare loss as he led Canton High to its first playoff victory since 1964 and finished the year as Class AAA area finalists with an 8–4 record. He was named All East Texas and was named The Tyler Morning Telegraph's East Texas Newcomer of the year. As a sophomore, he led CHS to another good season with an 8–2 record but narrowly missed the playoffs. In March 2017 he married Summer Dawn McCall, a former Tulsa cheerleader. === Attempted murder of father === In the spring of 2005, Kinne's father, who was also his coach at Canton High, was shot in the chest by the disgruntled parent of one of the players he coached. According to police reports, Jeffery Doyle Robertson, the father of a player who had often complained to coaches and administrators regarding the way his son was treated, walked into the Canton Fieldhouse and shot Coach Kinne at point blank range. Robertson then fled in his pickup truck and headed east towards Tyler, Texas. Kinne Sr. was on the phone with another coach who was at another school when he was shot. Kinne Jr. was taken by police into protective custody, and then told that his father had died when in fact he had survived despite being given only a 10% chance to live. Robertson was later apprehended in an area north of Tyler near Interstate 20 where he had slashed his wrists in an apparent suicide attempt. Robertson was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Ed Thomas, Iowa Aplington-Parkersburg high school football coach, is shot to death - ESPN ===Senior year=== After the shooting, Kinne stayed one more year at Canton High School, leading the team to its best season in school history with a 12–2 record, losing to Tatum High School, the eventual state champion. After the 2005 season, Kinne's father, who had recovered from his wounds, was offered a job at Baylor University, which he accepted. Kinne then decided to move to Gilmer, Texas about 70 miles to the east of Canton, to live with his mother and step-father. The decision to move was controversial as many speculated that Kinne moved for athletic reasons, which is prohibited by the UIL, the governing body of Texas High school athletics. Kinne enrolled at Gilmer High School and became the starting quarterback, leading the Buckeyes to a 10-0 record, but was upset in the first round of the playoffs by Liberty-Eylau High School. He finished his career with 11,695 passing yards and 130 touchdown passes. He also rushed 3,327 yards with 48 touchdowns. Kinne committed to Texas on December 28, 2006. Kinne also received football scholarships from Baylor, Florida, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Tennessee. ==College career== Kinne attended the University of Texas at Austin as a redshirt freshman in 2007, but was buried in the depth chart and decided to transfer. On May 7, 2008, he announced that he would transfer to the University of Tulsa. After sitting out the 2008 season due to transfer rules, Kinne became the starting quarterback for the Golden Hurricane in 2009 and remained the starter throughout his career. He finished his career with 9,472 yards and 81 touchdowns, and was named most valuable player in the 2012 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. ==Professional careerNew York Jets=== Kinne signed with the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent on April 28, 2012. He was waived by the team on June 28. ===Omaha Nighthawks=== Kinne joined the roster of the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League for their 2012 season. The United Football League folded later that year. ===San Antonio Talons=== Kinne signed with the San Antonio Talons of the Arena Football League in December 2012. ===Philadelphia Eagles=== On February 28, 2013, Kinne signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, and he was released on August 30, 2013. On October 22, 2013 Kinne was re-signed to the Eagles practice squad because of injuries to both of its top quarterbacks, Michael Vick and Nick Foles.\\"Source: Eagles to add QB Kinne to prax squad\\", Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia, October 21, 2013.\\"Eagles sign G.J.

He was released on August 30, but signed to the practice squad the next day. Kinne signed a futures contract with the Eagles on December 30, 2014. He converted to wide receiver in May 2015. On Sunday, August 30, 2015, Kinne was again waived by the Eagles. ===New York Giants=== On September 9, 2015, Kinne was signed by the New York Giants and was placed on the practice squad. On September 16, 2015, he was released by the Giants. On September 30, 2015, he was re-signed to the Giants' practice squad. On January 4, 2016, Kinne signed a reserve/future contract with the Giants. On May 5, 2016, the Giants waived Kinne. ===Calgary Stampeders=== Kinne signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) on June 13, 2016. Less than a week later, on June 19, 2016, Kinne was released by the team. ===Saskatchewan Roughriders=== Signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders (CFL) on June 24, 2016. Kinne made his CFL debut in the final game of the 2016 CFL season, completing 4 of 11 pass attempts for 24 yards. Kinne announced his retirement from professional football on May 9, 2017. ==Coaching careerEarly coaching career=== In 2017, Kinne was hired as an assistant coach with SMU under coach Chad Morris. When Morris joined the University of Arkansas before SMU played in the Frisco Bowl, new head coach Sonny Dykes chose to have Kinne serve as offensive coordinator and play caller for the bowl game. Kinne eventually followed Morris to Arkansas in 2018 as an offensive analyst. On February 25, 2019, Kinne was named an offensive assistant coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, working with special projects. ===Hawaii=== On January 31, 2020, it was announced that Kinne was leaving the Eagles to become the offensive coordinator for the University of Hawaii under head coach Todd Graham. ==References * Hawaii profile * SMU profile Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mesquite, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Canadian football quarterbacks Category:American players of Canadian football Category:Tulsa Golden Hurricane football players Category:New York Jets players Category:Omaha Nighthawks players Category:San Antonio Talons players Category:Philadelphia Eagles players Category:Philadelphia Eagles coaches Category:New York Giants players Category:Calgary Stampeders players Category:Saskatchewan Roughriders players Category:American football wide receivers Category:People from Gilmer, Texas Category:Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football coaches ","title":"G.

These characteristics are widely observed in nature, from biology to language to some social networks. == Concept == The hierarchical network model is part of the scale- free model family sharing their main property of having proportionally more hubs among the nodes than by random generation; however, it significantly differs from the other similar models (Barabási–Albert, Watts–Strogatz) in the distribution of the nodes' clustering coefficients: as other models would predict a constant clustering coefficient as the function of the degree of the node, in hierarchical models nodes with more links are expected to have a lower clustering coefficient. Moreover, while the Barabási-Albert model predicts a decreasing average clustering coefficient as the number of nodes increases, in the case of the hierarchical models there is no relationship between the size of the network and its average clustering coefficient. The development of hierarchical network models was mainly motivated by the failure of the other scale-free models in incorporating the scale-free topology and high clustering into one single model. Since several real-life networks (metabolic networks, the protein interaction network, the World Wide Web or some social networks) exhibit such properties, different hierarchical topologies were introduced in order to account for these various characteristics. == Algorithm == Hierarchical network models are usually derived in an iterative way by replicating the initial cluster of the network according to a certain rule. For instance, consider an initial network of five fully interconnected nodes (N=5). As a next step, create four replicas of this cluster and connect the peripheral nodes of each replica to the central node of the original cluster (N=25). This step can be repeated indefinitely, thereby for any k steps the number of nodes in the system can be derived by N=5k+1. Of course there have been several different ways for creating hierarchical systems proposed in the literature. These systems generally differ in the structure of the initial cluster as well as in the degree of expansion which is often referred to as the replication factor of the model. Example of a hierarchical network structure. == Properties  Degree distribution === Being part of the scale-free model family, the degree distribution of the hierarchical network model follows the power law meaning that a randomly selected node in the network has k edges with a probability : P\\\\left(k\\\\right)\\\\sim ck^{-\\\\gamma} \\\\, where c is a constant and γ is the degree exponent. In most real world networks exhibiting scale-free properties γ lies in the interval [2,3]. As a specific result for hierarchical models it has been shown that the degree exponent of the distribution function can be calculated as : \\\\gamma=1+\\\\frac{\\\\ln M}{\\\\ln (M-1)} where M represents the replication factor of the model. === Clustering coefficient === In contrast to the other scale-free models (Erdős–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, Watts–Strogatz) where the clustering coefficient is independent of the degree of a specific node, in hierarchical networks the clustering coefficient can be expressed as a function of the degree in the following way: : C\\\\left(k\\\\right)\\\\sim k^{-\\\\beta} \\\\, It has been analytically shown that in deterministic scale-free networks the exponent β takes the value of 1. == Examples  Actor network === Based on the actor database available at www.IMDB.com the network is defined by Hollywood actors who are connected to each other if they both appeared in the same movie, resulting in a data set of 392,340 nodes and 15,347,957 edges. As earlier studies have shown, this network exhibits scale- free properties at least for high values of k. Moreover, the clustering coefficients seem to follow the required scaling law with the parameter -1 providing evidence for the hierarchical topology of the network. Intuitively, one-performance actors have by definition a clustering coefficient of one while actors starring in several movies are highly unlikely to work with the same crew which in general results in a decreasing clustering coefficient as the number of co-stars grows. === Language network === Words can be regarded as network if one specifies the linkage criteria between them. Defining links as appearance as a synonym in the Merriam-Webster dictionary a semantic web of 182,853 nodes with 317,658 edges was constructed. As it turned out, the obtained network of words indeed follows a power law in its degree distribution while the distribution of the clustering coefficient indicates that the underlying web follows a hierarchical structure with γ=3.25 and β=1. === Network of webpages === By mapping the www.nd.edu domain a network of 325,729 nodes and 1,497,135 edges was obtained whose degree distribution followed a power law with γout=2.45 and γin=2.1 for the out- and in-degrees, respectively. The evidence for the scaling law distribution of the clustering coefficients is significantly weaker than in the previous cases although there is a clearly visible declining pattern in the distribution of C(k) indicating that the more links a domain has the less interconnected the linked/linking web pages are. === Domain network === The domain network, i.e. the internet at the autonomous system (AS) level where the administrative domains are said to be connected in case there is a router which connects them, was found to comprise 65,520 nodes and 24,412 links between them and exhibit the properties of a scale-free network. The sample distribution of the clustering coefficients was fitted by the scaling function C(k)~k−0.75 whose exponent is (in absolute terms) somewhat smaller than the theoretical parameter for deterministic scale-free networks. == References == Category:Networks Category:Social networks ","title":"Hierarchical network model"},{"id":"35856462","text":"is the second extended playiTunes - ミュージック - immi「クラクション - EP」 by Japanese electropop singer Immi.

He is best known for his work on the Human Genome Project, for which he was a pioneer along with John Sulston. ==Biography== Robert Waterston was born in 1943 in Detroit, Michigan. He went to Princeton as an undergraduate where he majored in engineering while spending as much time as possible studying the humanities; he wrote his senior dissertation on the plays of Eugene O'Neill. By this time he was thinking of switching to medicine but had never studied biology. While on what we might now call a 'gap year' visit to Germany he took courses in biology – in German – and returned to take up a place at the school of medicine of the University of Chicago. By 1972 he had acquired both MD and PhD degrees. A chance meeting with Sydney Brenner on a physiology summer school at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in 1969 had introduced him to the grand project then beginning at the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, England: to understand life at the molecular level through studying the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. At the earliest possible opportunity, Waterston left for Cambridge to become the third American post-doctoral researcher to join Brenner's group to work on the worm. Brenner was looking for worms with mutations that affected their behavior, as part of the search for genes controlling the nervous system and muscles. Waterston took on the task of looking at the cellular and molecular level for abnormalities in the muscle mutants, and within a few years had made discoveries that led to the cloning of genes for two important muscle proteins. He returned to the USA in 1976 as an assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology, at Washington University in St. Louis and set up a lab dedicated to studying the molecular biology of muscle in the worm. There, he and his colleagues identified many more muscle genes and investigated their role in muscle assembly and contraction, as well as discovering and analyzing transposable elements and nonsense suppressors. A few years later he switched to the Department of Genetics, where by 1991 he became chair. In the mid-1980s he made a sabbatical visit to the LMB, ostensibly to continue his work with Brenner. But the only space available was in the room where John Sulston and Alan Coulson were beginning to map the worm genome. Waterston joined them, and after his return to St Louis the worm map became a collaborative project between the two labs. In 1989, one of the first Human Genome Project grants went to Waterston and Sulston to begin the sequencing of the worm genome. They were so successful that at the same time that the Wellcome Trust established the Sanger Centre with Sulston at its head, Waterston received funding from the National Human Genome Research Institute to undertake large-scale human sequencing at his Washington University lab. The partnership became the first to complete the sequence of a multicellular organism when the worm genome was published in December 1998, and both labs played key roles in the sequencing of the human genome, with Waterston’s lab contributing more of the finished sequence than any other US lab. The partnership went on have leading roles in the sequencing of both the mouse and chimpanzee genomes. Waterston, like his colleague John Sulston, has always been committed to the free release of scientific information, and he was an influential voice in establishing the Bermuda Principles on data sharing in 1996. In the past few years Waterston and Sulston have jointly won numerous awards for their scientific work and their support for the scientific community, including the Gairdner Award, the General Motors prize, the Dan David Prize and the George W Beadle medal of the Genetics Society of America. Waterston also received the Gruber Prize in genetics. In January 2003, Waterston moved from St Louis to become the new William Gates III Endowed Chair in Biomedical Science, Professor and Chair of the Department of Genome Sciences, at the University of Washington in Seattle. He is leading research into the genetic control of development in the nematode. He has developed novel technology to decipher automatically the dynamic expression of genes with single cell resolution and minute time resolution and applied the technology to describe the expression patterns of more than 200 transcription factors. As part of the NHGRI modENCODE project, with collaborators he has collected data that accurately defines the complement of both protein coding and many noncoding genes of the nematode. In another modENCODE project he and collaborators are defining the binding sites for those transcription factors. They are now combining these sets of data to construct increasingly complete regulatory networks directing C. elegans embryonic development. Recently, he has used next generation sequencing methods to develop a collection of mutant C. elegans strains containing more than million mutations to probe the function of the more than 20,000 C. elegans genes. Collaborations, both inside and outside of the university, have helped the Genome Sciences Department bolster an exciting teamwork atmosphere. It has formed close ties with the School of Medicine to study human variation more effectively. The faculty also partner with clinicians interested in applying genomic technologies to medical problems. In addition, the Department has established a strong outreach program. By bringing leading-edge science and ethics teachers to K-12 classes, the Department helps address the unique social and ethical challenges implied in the new discoveries in genome sciences. Today, the UW Department of Genome Sciences is carrying on its legacy of collaboration. It is a world pioneer of genome interpretation and technology innovation, ranking in the top three Genetics/ Genomics graduate programs in the United States It brings national prominence to the University of Washington and is at the forefront in unlocking life-changing secrets of the genome. \\\\- Adapted from the Wellcome Trust biography written by Georgina Ferry. == References == Category:Living people Category:1943 births Category:Scientists from Detroit Category:Human Genome Project scientists Category:21st-century American biologists ","title":"Bob Waterston"},{"id":"35856467","text":"Asfich (, also Romanized as Āsfīch; also known as Esfīj) is a village in Fakhrud Rural District, Qohestan District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The film is about the singing and acting career of Tally Brown, a classically trained opera and blues singer who was a star of underground films in New York City and a denizen of its underworld in the late 1960s. In this documentary, Praunheim relies on extensive interviews with Brown, as she recounts her collaboration with Andy Warhol, Taylor Mead and others, as well as her friendships with artist Ching Ho Cheng, performers Holly Woodlawn, and Divine. Brown opens the film with a cover of David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" and concludes with \\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.\\" The film captures not only Tally Brown's career but also a particular New York milieu in the 1970s. In the same year of its release, the documentary won the Film Award in Silver at the German Film Awards for Outstanding Non-Feature Film. The documentary is also noteworthy for being the first of Von Praunheim's many portraits of women, usually aging legendary performers, who have become cult figures among the LGBT community. ==Notes * == References == *Murray, Raymond.

Built in 1838 by John Meigs Hall, it was the home of 19th century industrialist and philanthropist Samuel Simpson. Some of the house's structural beams, repurposed from an older building in the same location, date back to the 1600s. Around 1867, the home was extensively redesigned by renowned New Haven, Connecticut architect Henry Austin, giving it Renaissance Revival characteristics. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. == History  Simpson- Taber Residence === The house originally stood at 216 North Main Street in downtown Wallingford. Simpson, a silver manufacturer, partnered with Robert Wallace in the firm of R. Wallace & Sons, the forerunner of Wallace Silversmiths Inc. He was later president of Simpson, Hall, Miller, & Co., which was one of the founding companies of the International Silver Company. Simpson was a noted philanthropist and benefactor to Wallingford, and his house was a prominent fixture in the town's downtown area. Simpson's great- granddaughter, Margaret Tibbets Taber (1891-1985), later ran a bookstore in the house. Known for her philanthropy and dedication to the public library, Taber sold the property to the town in 1978 under the condition that the land be used for library purposes. === Preservation Debate and Relocation === In 1982, the Wallingford Public Library moved from its original location at 60 North Main Street to a newly constructed building on the former Taber property, alongside the Simpson House. The library Board of Managers, reluctant to use library funds for maintenance of the aging mansion, suggested demolishing the house and repurposing the site as a garden and outdoor reading area. In 1984, given a three-month deadline to avoid demolition, community members formed the Simpson-Taber Residence Preservation Committee. The committee sought to raise donations to keep the Taber house in its current location and use it as a meeting place for local community groups. In a 7-2 vote, the Town Council rejected the committee's plans, but agreed to consider proposals to move the house to a new location rather than demolish it. In 1987, a local developer purchased the house from the town for one dollar and had it moved to its current location on Scard Road. A portion of the original wrought iron fence remains on the original property outside of the library building. ==Appearances in pop culture== In 2012, the Samuel Simpson House served as the main location in director A.D. Calvo's film The Midnight Game. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Greek Revival houses in Connecticut Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1838 Category:Buildings and structures in Wallingford, Connecticut Category:Houses in New Haven County, Connecticut ","title":"Samuel Simpson House"},{"id":"35856718","text":"Sik (, also Romanized as Sīk) is a village in Marz Rural District, Chah Dadkhoda District, Qaleh Ganj County, Kerman Province, Iran.

They are currently members of and are affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA. ==History== Cribbs Football Club was founded in London in 1958 as Sun Life Assurance. The Bristol team was established in 1976 when Sun Life first relocated to Bristol. Initially, two teams were run, participating in the Bristol and Avon League, playing at Dundridge Farm. However, when the Cribbs Causeway ground was opened in 1978, the first team were promoted straight to the Avon Premier Combination League (later renamed Bristol Premier Combination) where they stayed for 20 years until they eventually won promotion to the County League in 1999–2000. In the summer of 2011, the club changed from AXA to its new name of Cribbs Friends Life FC ready for the 2011–12 season. The 2011–12 season was Cribbs' most successful season to date as the club claimed its first Gloucestershire County League title on its way to an unprecedented League and Cup double, with the team later adding the Les James League Cup to the League Championship, in the process becoming the first and only side to achieve this feat. As well as winning the double, the club finally earned promotion to the Western League Division One for the 2012–13 season as a result of being crowned champions. The season turned out to be a successful one for the club in general as the Reserve and 'A' sides also gained promotion. In 2013, Cribbs Friends Life F.C. changed their name to Cribbs F.C. after losing the backing of their sponsors. ==Other sides== Today the club runs four Saturday sides, spread across the Western League, Bristol Premier Combination and the Bristol and District League, one Sunday side in the Bristol Regional League, one veterans' side who play in the Bristol Casuals League and an U18 side that plays in the Bristol U18s' Combination League. In season 2018/2019, the reserve side completed a unique treble by winning the Bristol Premier Combination League and Cup along with success in the Gloucestershire FA Senior Amateur Cup. The 1st XI also won the Gloucestershire FA Challenge Trophy in 2018/2019 with success against Bishop's Cleeve FC. ==Ground== Cribbs play their home matches at The Lawns, Station Road, Henbury, Bristol, BS10 7TB. The grounds consist of 4 full size grass football pitches, 2 tennis courts and a 3G astro turf. The 1st team pitch and surrounding area is fully compliant with FA ground grading requirements for the Western League. Hard standing surrounds the pitch in addition to a perimeter barrier. A 50 seater stand with room for an additional 100 standing was built in 2013.

Her main achievement was taking charge of the state legislation that gave women of Nevada the right to vote. She was the first head of the department of history of the University of Nevada (1897–1901) And was active in the suffrage movement in England in 1909–1911, working with Emmeline Pankhurst. She was president of the Nevada equal franchise society in 1912, and the first national chairman of the National Woman's Party in 1916. She was the first woman to run for the United States Senate; She lost twice, in 1918 and 1920.Anderson, Kathryn. \\"Anne Henrietta Martin.\\" American National Biography Online. N.p., Feb. 2000. Web. 1 Mar. 2014. . ==Early years== Martin was the daughter of William O'Hara Martin, of Irish descent, who served as a Nevada State Senator, and her mother, Louise Stadtmuller Martin, was Bavarian. She attended Bishop Whitaker's School for Girls in Reno. Anne attended the University of Nevada (1891–1894), where she earned a degree in History. She earned a second B.A. in 1896 and an M.A. in History in 1897 from Stanford University. ==Career== In 1897, Martin established the University of Nevada's department of history. After two years in the department, she left to study at Columbia University, Chase's Art School, University of London, and University of Leipzig; but returned to the department in 1901–1903. During her leave from the university, Martin recommended the Board of Regents replace her with Jeanne Wier, a friend of hers from Stanford who was just finishing her degree.Chung, Su Kim. (2015). \\"We Seek to Be Patient\\": Jeanne Wier and the Nevada Historical Society, 1904–1950. UCLA: Information Studies 045A. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/51d75576 p. 72 Martin returned from Europe in 1901 to attend her father's funeral. Her father's death gave her a revelation, \\"suddenly made a feminist of me! . . . I found that I stood alone in my family against a man-controlled world.\\" Martin traveled in Europe and Asia and experienced the women's revolution in England between 1909 and 1911, she became a Fabian Socialist, and wrote short stories and political articles, occasionally under the pen name of Anne O'Hara. Martin was arrested in 1910 over an issue of trying to enfranchise British women. Her friend from Stanford, Lou Henry Hoover, sent husband, Herbert Hoover, to pay Martin's bail, but Frederick Pethick-Lawrence had already taken care of that. After returning to Nevada in the fall of 1911, she became president of the Nevada Equal Franchise Society in February 1912 and organized a campaign over sparsely populated deserts that convinced male voters to enfranchise women on November 3, 1914. This success led to her representation of the national movement as a speaker and executive committee member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the Congressional Union. Martin helped organize voting women in the West in 1916 to challenge Democrats. She was one of the Silent Sentinels, National Woman's Party women who picketed for suffrage in front of the White House on July 14, 1917; as a result, she was sentenced to Occoquan Workhouse, but was pardoned less than a week later by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1918, representing Nevada, Martin was the first American woman to run for the US Senate. Martin's campaigns focused on illuminating how women could act as a positive influence in the political world. Her platforms focused on providing better working conditions for men and women and nationalization of railroads and public utilities alienated women suffragists. Between her 1918 and 1920 campaigns Martin wrote a series of articles and essays and in these essays Martin urges women to form autonomous political organizations. Martin moved to Carmel, California, in 1921, and recuperated from a heart attack in 1930. In the 1940s, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Nevada (1945); and wrote two articles for the Encyclopædia Britannica (Josephine Butler, 1944 edition; and White Slavery, 1948 edition). == Death == Anne Henrietta Martin died in Carmel, California in 1951. ==See also== *List of suffragists and suffragettes *Timeline of women's suffrage *Women's suffrage organizations ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Howard, Anne Bail (1985), The long campaign: a biography of Anne Martin, ==External links== *Anne Henrietta Martin Papers BANC MSS P-G 282.

Owned by the Charleston Importing and Exporting Company, Syren made her first run on 5 November 1863, importing supplies for the Confederacy from Nassau to Wilmington. Syren completed a record 33 runs through the Union blockade, the most of any blockade runner, before invading Union forces captured her while Syren was berthed at Charleston Harbor.Frajola, 2012 p.6 ==History== After President Lincoln had proclaimed a blockade along the coastlines surrounding the newly formed Confederate States, the Confederacy was forced to turn to overseas sources for much of its supply. Getting this supply into southern harbors involved running through and evading the Union ships on blockade patrol. To meet this special task special 'blockade runners' were designed and built by various prominent shipping companies of the time. Among the most notable was The 'Charleston Importing and Exporting Company' who built the SS Syren, while 'John Fraser and Company', built Fox, the 'Chicora Importing and Exporting Company' building Chicora, and 'Druid Company', with their Druid.Wise, 1991 p.210 Syren was a seagoing steam vessel and as a blockade runner, was constructed long and narrow with a flat bottom and with lighter gauge steel for its hull, giving the ship a shallow draft that allowed it to cut through the water much easier. Equipped with two steam engines and a twin paddle-wheel system these blockade runners were the fastest seagoing vessels in use at that time. Because most of the runs were made at night these vessels were painted a dark gray color to better conceal their profile against the night sea, a practiced that eventually earned them the name greyhound. Just before coming into sight of the Confederate coastline the steamers would often switch to burning a smokeless anthracite coal which greatly reduced their profile against the horizon. A typical blockade runner would burn 50-60 tons of coal a day. Sometimes cotton soaked in turpentine would be used as fuel, as it gave off little smoke while producing an intense heat that resulted in a marked increase in the ship's speed.Peters, 1939 p.18McNeil, 2002 p.46 ===Blockade running=== SS Syren began her career as a blockade runner later in the war taking her maiden voyage on 5 November 1863 from Nassau to Wilmington. She was used to transport badly needed arms and other military supplies from Nassau into Charleston Harbor. Along with carrying cargo, she was used to carry mail and other correspondence in and out of the Confederacy. Surviving examples of this mail are scarce and are kept by historians, collectors and museums as dated documentation of the various voyages made by this ship. Little is known about the various commanders who served aboard Syren, but much of this ship's success as a blockade runner can be attributed to her daring captains who, because of the ships faster speed, ignored many of the norms of blockade-running. With her tremendous success rate Syren was considered the only steamship necessary to make substantial profits for the Charleston Importing and Exporting Company.Wise, 1991 p.163 ===Capture=== Syren was captured, along with Celt, Deer and Lady Davis on February 18, 1865, in Charleston harbor at the Ashley River where she had successfully slipped through the blockade the night before. She was captured by the USS Gladiolus,U.S.Navy, DANFS, USS Gladiolus, page article acting Ensign Napoleon Boughton in command. The USS Commodore Macdonough had also arrived at the scene but turned back because Gladiolus had already secured the scene. After being abandoned by her crew, her pipes cut and set on fire, the Union Army and Navy soon appeared on the scene and organized a fire brigade of soldiers and blacks, extinguishing the flames before they took hold and did much damage. After the ship was saved and salvaged she was sailed north to Boston for condemnation as a prize of war where the crew of Gladiolus claimed both salvage and prize-money. Because Syren was abandoned and not actually captured at the hands of the crew who first arrived at the scene but as a result of the siege of Charleston by Union forces there was litigation that followed involving the dispersal of this prize of war between the U.S. Government and the 'capturing' crew members of Gladious, i.e. the claimants.Federal Cases, 1896 pp.233-235 Syren later served as a merchantman for the U.S. Navy.Wise, 1991 p.211 ==See also== *Blockade runners of the American Civil War *List of ships captured in the American Civil War *Bibliography of American Civil War naval history *Union blockade, the 'Anaconda plan' *Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War *Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War *Glossary of nautical terms ==CitationsReferences== * * Url * Url * Url * Url * Url ===Primary sources=== * Url1 Url2 * Url . * Url ==External links== * The Confederate Naval Historical Society * The American Civil War Home Page *N.Y.

Cherry is the President and co-founder of Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, a non-profit civil rights organization located in Paris, Texas. Founded in 2003, CCFRE co-sponsored events with the U.S. Department of Justice, Lone Star Legal Aid, and the American Civil Liberties Union. == Early life == Cherry grew up in Blossom Texas. Her late father, Zeb Reynolds, was a farmer, and her mother, Irene Whitney, was a domestic worker. She began school at T.G. Givens, which was then, a segregated school in Paris, Texas. She had to be bused 10 miles to the school even though there was a local school district in the town where she lived. After the schools were forced to integrate, she attended the formerly \\"whites only\\" school in Blossom. Cherry graduated from Prairiland High School in Pattonville, Texas. She went on to attend Paris Junior College and East Texas State University. Cherry worked as a Licensed Vocational Nurse for 9 years before becoming a civil rights activist. Cherry has two daughters, Shauncia Cherry and Tiffany Cherry, and one son, Rico Lewis. == Activism == Brenda Cherry with Paris resident Patrick Lyons protesting in 2010 === Schoolyard assault === On October 23, 2003, an 11-year-old black student was reportedly attacked by a principal at Crockett Middle School in Paris, Texas. The child was removed from the school and sent to a detention center. Cherry, along with a small group of people, including the child's mother and grandfather, staged a protest in front of the school. During the protest, the child was released from the detention center. This event marked the beginning of several future protest demonstrations in the town. === Shaquanda Cotton === Brenda Cherry along with Shaquanda Cotton, Erykah Badu, and Creola Cotton at the Africa Care Academy 10th Annual Educational Awards Banquet in Dallas, Texas Shaquanda Cotton was an African-American student that attended Paris High School in Paris, Texas. On March 16, 2006, Cotton, aged 14, was arrested for allegedly shoving a school hall monitor. Having no prior criminal history, Cotton was tried and sentenced to up to 7 years in the Texas Youth Commission. During the same time frame, the judge in the case, Chuck Superville, sentenced a Caucasian 14-year-old girl who had a prior criminal history to probation after committing the confirmed crime of arson. Writer Darwin Campbell with African- American News and Issues broke the story, which garnered attention to Cotton's sentencing. After serving a year and one month in prison, the Chicago Tribune story written by Howard Witt led the case to national exposure. A large protest led by comedian Rickey Smiley was held at the Lamar County Courthouse in Paris, Texas. Approximately two weeks after the Tribune article and protest, ShaQuanda was released. Cherry was interviewed by the BBC regarding Cotton, and the case was included in a BBC documentary by United Kingdom reporter Julian O'Halloran. === Brandon McClelland === Rally for Brandon McClelland in Paris, Texas Brandon McClelland was a 24-year-old African American male who lived in Paris, Texas. On September 16, 2008, his body was found partially dismembered and mutilated on a farm road approximately 17 miles from his home. The local newspaper, The Paris News, reported the death as a hit-and-run by an unknown truck. Due to the activism of Cherry and the Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, the case gained national attention. After dispute about whether McClelland was dragged under the truck or behind it, and while awaiting autopsy reports, USA Today interviewed Cherry. \\"Authorities have not seriously considered the possibility that this was a hate crime. There's a problem in Paris, Texas. I don't see a difference in getting dragged behind a truck and getting dragged under a truck.\\" Further investigation revealed that McClelland was last seen alive with two Caucasian men, Shannon Finley and Charles Ryan Crostley, both of whom had extensive criminal history. Anderson Cooper 360° reported that the two men were charged with killing McClelland and both subsequently plead \\"not guilty.\\" Special prosecutor Toby Shook cited lack of evidence to the case, and the murder charges were dropped in June 2009. The two men were released. CBS News quoted Cherry, \\"His body was dragged and nobody gets charged? Even if a trucker came forward, that's all it takes? Even the trucker's not charged? If you hit someone, you don't get charged? Nobody gets charged with this? It's not surprising, but it's sad. It appears that a black man's life means nothing here in Paris.\\" Multiple protests have been led by Cherry, along with Jim Blackwell and the New Black Panther Party. The case remains an open murder investigation. === Brandarian Thomas === Brandarian Thomas was a 14-year-old African American student at Travis Junior High School in Paris, Texas. In June 2008, Police handcuffed and arrested Thomas at his home for allegedly \\"touching a female student's butt and crotch\\" in class. Thomas denied the accusations. Thomas' mother contacted Cherry, who convinced her to take the case to trial rather than accept a plea deal. Texas Observer reporter Forrest Wilder documented the case. Cherry views the Cotton and Thomas prosecutions as extreme examples of a larger pattern of racial discrimination in Paris public schools. Cherry stated, \\"The black kids are punished more often, more harshly. I think they go to extremes; they punish them for little things. A lot of times, they see a black kid as more menacing.\\" Though prosecutors offered a plea deal to Thomas (two years of probation in exchange for a guilty plea), Cherry helped convince Thomas' mother to take the matter to trial in front of the same judge who heard the Cotton case. \\"It's ridiculous,\\" Cherry stated. \\"He was 14. You're going to ruin his life because you can't make him plead guilty?\\" === Cornelius Gill === Cornelius Gill was an 18-year-old African American high school student in Paris, Texas. On November 11, 2009, Gill was picking up pecans when he was approached by a Paris police officer who questioned him about a stolen car that had been found a few blocks away. Gill refused to be questioned and said a curse word. The officer arrested Gill and placed him in handcuffs behind his back. When another police car pulled up, Gill was lifted and body slammed face down onto the vehicle. Cherry witnessed a portion of the incident and she, along with Gill's mother, filed a complaint with the Paris Police Department. Cherry obtained the video of the incident. Gill was sentenced to 100 days in jail by Judge Chuck Superville. Although the video footage shows no evidence of such, the officer claimed Gill assaulted him while placing him in the patrol car. Gill was charged with Assault of a Public Servant and Resisting Arrest. The complaint resulted in a suspension of the officer, but the suspension was lifted when the officer appealed. The case resulted in an outcry from civilians regarding police brutality and unnecessary force. According to the Huffington Post, Cherry stated that the ruling sends a message to local police that they can do whatever they want. \\"What's going to stop the officer from doing that again and again? It makes me fearful,\\" she said. The dash cam video was released after Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality filed an open records request. \\"We're already in a bad situation here in Paris, and this just makes it worse,\\" Cherry stated. === Bobby Yates === Bobby Yates was a 51-year-old African American man in Paris, Texas. Yates was paralyzed from the waist down due to a gunshot wound during a hunting accident approximately 20 years earlier. His lower body was removed from his hips down due to an infection. On a late night in 2008, Yates made a 911 call to the local police stating that he had been beaten by a 16-year-old white female and two adult males who were at his home that refused to leave. When the police came, the female claimed that Yates had sexually assaulted her. The two males were with her the entire time. The police sided with the female, and Yates was later arrested and charged with sexual assault. Cherry along with her organization held protests and filed complaints on Yates' behalf. After 3 years of legal action, the sexual assault charge was dismissed. Brenda Cherry along with Jim Blackwell on the Robert Ashley Show on KHVN === Aaron Hart === Aaron Hart was 18 years old when he was arrested and charged with sexual assault. Hart has an intellectual disability and an IQ of 47. Hart had been playing with a 5-year-old child and they exposed and touched each other's private parts. At trial, Hart's court-appointed attorney called no witnesses on Hart's behalf and failed to obtain an independent doctor for a competency hearing. Judge Eric Clifford sentenced Hart to 100 years in prison on June 10, 2009, claiming that he had no other choice. Within the same time frame, Clifford had sentenced a defendant charged with the same offense, and without a disability, to four years in prison. Hart was allegedly sexually assaulted while awaiting trial in Lamar County Jail. Cherry and her organization advocated on Hart's behalf. Numerous protest marches were held, led by CCFRE and Jim Blackwell of the Tarrant County Local Organizing Committee. The case gained national attention. \\"This is just horrible,\\" stated Cherry in a Los Angeles Times article after Judge Clifford made his ruling. \\"How could the judge not take his mental ability into consideration?\\" Hart was given a new trial on appeal. Hart ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 10 years in prison where he remains. === Turner Industries === Brenda Cherry with Turner Industries employees in Louisiana Turner Industries is a privately owned industrial plant with facilities in several cities and states including Paris, Texas. In February 2009, Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality received complaints and photos regarding a noose, racist graffiti, Confederate flags, and salary and advancement discrimination against black workers in the Turner Industries Paris plant. Activism led to a federal investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The findings led to a federal lawsuit which was settled out of court, as well as changes in Turner Industries employment practices. Cherry stated, \\"One of my biggest concerns regarding the racist graffiti, noose, and other things found at the plant is the mentality of those who put it there. Those same people serve on juries, and some go on to have supervisory positions or other positions of authority.\\" The Turner Industries investigation was one of the largest civil rights investigations ever undertaken in the State of Texas. === Roping and bullying of autistic student === On April 20, 2011, a 14-year-old African American autistic student was taken by an 18-year-old Caucasian student into the greenhouse at Paris High School. The 18-year-old threw a rope over a beam and placed the other end around the waist of the 14-year-old. He kicked his feet and beat his hand with a stick until bloody when the 14-year-old attempted to get free. The girlfriend of the 18-year-old student stood laughing and recorded the incident with her cell phone. When the group returned to class, a male teacher took the recording and erased it. After the school refused to discipline the 18-year-old and his girlfriend, or the teacher who erased the evidence, Cherry and CCFRE advocated on behalf of the mother, Tina Washington, and her son. The county attorney refused to charge the 18-year-old student even though it was a felony offense. Several protests were led by Cherry and Jim Blackwell regarding the incident. The case is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. == Advocacy == Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality co- sponsored a community reconciliation meeting with the U.S. Department of Justice which was featured in the Chicago Tribune. \\"I'm here to talk about racism. I don't see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn't exist,\\" stated Cherry. \\"When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention—it's racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that's not racism, what is it? \\"This town is being forced to look at things they never wanted to look at before,\\" stated Cherry in an excerpt from Newsweek. Cherry, along with Lone Star Legal Aid, a local nonprofit law firm, compiled statistics showing that the Paris Independent School District punished black kids eight times more often than white ones, even though blacks make up a minority of the population. The U.S. Department of Education ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to attribute the discrepancy to racism. The New York Times quoted Cherry, \\"I think we are probably stuck in 1930 right about now. If you complain about anything, you are going to be punished.\\" Cherry has been an advocate for civil and human rights, and continues her work to address race and humanitarian issues. == References == Category:American women activists Category:African-American activists Category:Living people Category:Civil rights and liberties Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:American humanitarians Category:1958 births Category:People from Paris, Texas Category:American civil rights activists ","title":"Brenda Cherry"},{"id":"35857002","text":"Joculator cossignanii is a species of minute sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Cerithiopsidae.Joculator cossignanii at World Register of Marine Species.

He resided in Evanston, Illinois, after spending most of his adult life in Washington, D.C., Germany and Serbia. ==Early childhood and education== Binder was born on February 22, 1931, in London, England, along with his twin sister Deborah, to American parents Abner Carroll Binder, an American journalist best known for contributions as a newspaper correspondent and editor for the Chicago Daily News and the Minneapolis Tribune, and Dorothy (Walton) Binder. He and his twin sister had two other siblings.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?pid=177787011 Binder was particularly close to his siblings, his twin sister Debbie, his older sister Mary \\"Sis\\" Kelsey and his older brother Carroll Jr., who was later killed in action over France during World War II. His brother's untimely death — the subject of the book \\"One Crowded Hour: The Saga of An American Boy\\" by Jenane (Patterson) Binder — was the source of considerable despair for his family and eventually led to his enrollment at a distant boarding school in Pennsylvania at the age of 13.https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Binder.xml The Carroll Binder Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University is named after Binder's father, a 1916 Harvard graduate, and Binder's brother, also a 1943 Harvard graduate, and is part of the Nieman Fellowship program at Harvard that \\"allow[s] a group of accomplished journalists — half American, half international — to come to Harvard for a year of study on the subjects of their choice.\\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/05/announcing-the-75th-class-of-nieman- fellows/ Born in London, Binder was raised in Highland Park, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, until the age of 13, when he left home to attend George School,\\"Chicago Park Tour Brings Alumni Together.\\" George School: a Quaker, coeducational boarding and day school, grades nine through twelve..

Following the academic path previously taken by his father and his older brother, he graduated from Harvard University in 1953, before attending the University of Cologne for graduate study on a Fulbright Scholarship. He worked as an assistant in American literature at the Salzburg Seminar in Austria in the summer of 1953. ==Personal life== Binder married Dr. Helga Binder, née Wagner, a German physician whom he had met in East Berlin during his stint in Germany and who went on to become a pediatric physician at Children's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Binder had three daughters and numerous grandchildren. Upon their retirement, Binder and his wife moved from Chevy Chase, Maryland, to Evanston, Illinois, to be close to their youngest daughter (Dr. Alena Binder) and her family and his early childhood home in Highland Park, Illinois, where a memorial honoring his World War II veteran brother stands in the town center. ==CareerEarly journalist years=== Binder started his journalist career as a reporter and an editor for Carbondale Free Press-Southern-Illinoisan (1951), Louisville Times (1954–1956), Institute of Current World Affairs in Germany (1957–1959), Daily Mail in London (1959–1960) and Minneapolis Tribune (1960–1961). He also contributed to other publications including The Reporter, The Nation, The New Republic, Foreign Policy (published in Washington), Politika (a daily published in Belgrade), Vreme (a weekly published in Belgrade), Weltwoche (a Swiss weekly published in Zurich), der Spiegel (a German weekly published in Hamburg), Stern (a German magazine published in Hamburg), Neues Deutschland (a daily published in Berlin), Blaetter fuer deutsche und internationale Politik (published in Bonn), and The Wilson Quarterly (published in Washington). In 1970, he was elected president of the Verein der Auslaendischen Presse (Foreign Press Association) of Germany. ===New York Times years=== Binder was a journalist for the New York Times from 1961 to 2004, reporting on topics regarding Eastern and Western Europe, the Soviet Union, the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico. He served as a foreign correspondent in 1961 in Berlin, where he reported on the building of the Berlin wall.Binder, David. \\"BERLIN WALL BECOMES A 'LIVING, GROWING THING'; East Germans Strengthen Barrier With Many New Fortifications 'Vopos' Surly on Patrol Duty.\\" New York Times [New York City] 26 11 1961, 1st ed.

During the latter period, he reported on the gradual rapprochement between East and West Germany, and on the Prague Spring of 1968. He then transferred to the Washington, D.C. bureau as a diplomatic correspondent, later serving as the bureau's assistant news editor, and again as a reporter. Binder served on numerous occasions as a special correspondent for the New York Times, including reporting on the decline of the Soviet Bloc in 1987, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Communist regimes in the German Democratic Republic,Adler, Ruth. A day in the life of. Reprint. Ayer Publishing, 1981. 14-15. Web. Romania, Albania and Yugoslavia in 1990–1992. In the 1990s, he traveled extensively in the Balkans to report on the wars that brought about the dissolution of Yugoslavia (1990–1995) and the post-Communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania. He also reported on the unification of West and East Germany. In 2000 and 2001, he went back to the Balkans to report on the burgeoning sex trade and drug smuggling in the region for MSNBC. Early in his career, he also worked briefly as a science reporter for the New York Times, and then returned to the post more than three decades later to report on wildlife biology. In all, Binder published over 2,400 articles, books, book reviews and commentaries before retiring from the New York Times in 2004. David published original text in English and German, and was proficient in Serbo-Croatian, Greek and French. During his tenure at the New York Times, Binder also published a number of lighthearted articles about his family, including those about the clumsiness of the men in his family and his road trip with his youngest daughter. The New York Times' July 1, 2019 article by Robert D. McFadden on Binder's career, entitled \\"David Binder, 88, Dies; Chronicled the Cold War and Its Aftermath,\\" stated that Binder was \\"[a] restless, relentless journalist [who] covered the Berlin Wall’s construction in 1961 and its destruction in 1989 — bookends to his many hundreds of reports on East-West tensions and life under the Communist regimes in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/media/david-binder-dead.html ===Post-New York Times years=== After his retirement from the New York Times, Binder continued to contribute to the newspaper with his researched and detailed obituaries of political or cultural figures including Egon Bahr, John Keegan, Rauf Denktash, Christa Wolf, Judith Coplon, Werner Eberlein, Spike Milligan, Hildegard Knef, Stefan Heym, Budd Boetticher and Ruth Werner. Binder was one of the contributors to the New York Times obituary of Zbigniew Brzezinski, a National Security Adviser for the Jimmy Carter administration, who died on May 26, 2017. Binder gave lectures at Columbia University (\\"A Correspondent Reflects on Serbia 1963 - 1990\\"), the Wilson Center (\\"Combating Organized Crime in the Balkans\\"), the Serbian American Museum St. Sava and Indiana University and commented in articles published in various newspapers. ===Television appearances=== Binder also appeared on a number of televised news segments including CNN \\"Insight - The Macedonia Flashpoint\\", C-SPAN \\"Kosovo Liberation Army\\", C-SPAN \\"Situation in Kosovo\\", C-SPAN \\"Bosnia: How Did We Get There?\\", C-SPAN \\"U.S. Policy in the Balkans\\" and C-SPAN \\"Are the Western Media Combatants in Bosnia?\\" ===Other publications and books=== In 1989, Binder was appointed to the Editorial Advisory Board of the newly created Mediterranean Quarterly.Binder, David. \\"Approaching Albania\\".

SVM algorithms categorize multidimensional data, with the goal of fitting the training set data well, but also avoiding overfitting, so that the solution generalizes to new data points. Regularization algorithms also aim to fit training set data and avoid overfitting. They do this by choosing a fitting function that has low error on the training set, but also is not too complicated, where complicated functions are functions with high norms in some function space. Specifically, Tikhonov regularization algorithms choose a function that minimizes the sum of training-set error plus the function's norm. The training-set error can be calculated with different loss functions. For example, regularized least squares is a special case of Tikhonov regularization using the squared error loss as the loss function. Regularization perspectives on support-vector machines interpret SVM as a special case of Tikhonov regularization, specifically Tikhonov regularization with the hinge loss for a loss function. This provides a theoretical framework with which to analyze SVM algorithms and compare them to other algorithms with the same goals: to generalize without overfitting. SVM was first proposed in 1995 by Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik, and framed geometrically as a method for finding hyperplanes that can separate multidimensional data into two categories. This traditional geometric interpretation of SVMs provides useful intuition about how SVMs work, but is difficult to relate to other machine-learning techniques for avoiding overfitting, like regularization, early stopping, sparsity and Bayesian inference. However, once it was discovered that SVM is also a special case of Tikhonov regularization, regularization perspectives on SVM provided the theory necessary to fit SVM within a broader class of algorithms. This has enabled detailed comparisons between SVM and other forms of Tikhonov regularization, and theoretical grounding for why it is beneficial to use SVM's loss function, the hinge loss. ==Theoretical background== In the statistical learning theory framework, an algorithm is a strategy for choosing a function f \\\\colon \\\\mathbf X \\\\to \\\\mathbf Y given a training set S = \\\\\\\\{(x_1, y_1), \\\\ldots, (x_n, y_n)\\\\\\\\} of inputs x_i and their labels y_i (the labels are usually \\\\pm1). Regularization strategies avoid overfitting by choosing a function that fits the data, but is not too complex. Specifically: : f = \\\\underset{f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\operatorname{argmin}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n V(y_i, f(x_i)) + \\\\lambda\\\\f\\\\^2_\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\mathcal{H} is a hypothesis spaceA hypothesis space is the set of functions used to model the data in a machine- learning problem. Each function corresponds to a hypothesis about the structure of the data. Typically the functions in a hypothesis space form a Hilbert space of functions with norm formed from the loss function. of functions, V \\\\colon \\\\mathbf Y \\\\times \\\\mathbf Y \\\\to \\\\mathbb R is the loss function, \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_\\\\mathcal H is a norm on the hypothesis space of functions, and \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb R is the regularization parameter.For insight on choosing the parameter, see, e.g., When \\\\mathcal{H} is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, there exists a kernel function K \\\\colon \\\\mathbf X \\\\times \\\\mathbf X \\\\to \\\\mathbb R that can be written as an n \\\\times n symmetric positive-definite matrix \\\\mathbf K. By the representer theorem,See : f(x_i) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n c_j \\\\mathbf K_{ij}, \\\\text{ and } \\\\f\\\\^2_{\\\\mathcal H} = \\\\langle f, f\\\\rangle_\\\\mathcal H = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n c_i c_jK(x_i, x_j) = c^T \\\\mathbf K c. ==Special properties of the hinge loss== Hinge and misclassification loss functions The simplest and most intuitive loss function for categorization is the misclassification loss, or 0–1 loss, which is 0 if f(x_i) = y_i and 1 if f(x_i) eq y_i, i.e. the Heaviside step function on -y_if(x_i). However, this loss function is not convex, which makes the regularization problem very difficult to minimize computationally. Therefore, we look for convex substitutes for the 0–1 loss. The hinge loss, V\\\\big(y_i, f(x_i)\\\\big) = \\\\big(1 - yf(x)\\\\big)_+, where (s)_+ = \\\\max(s, 0), provides such a convex relaxation. In fact, the hinge loss is the tightest convex upper bound to the 0–1 misclassification loss function, and with infinite data returns the Bayes-optimal solution: : f_b(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & p(1\\\\mid x) > p(-1\\\\mid x), \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1, & p(1\\\\mid x) < p(-1\\\\mid x). \\\\end{cases} ==Derivation== The Tikhonov regularization problem can be shown to be equivalent to traditional formulations of SVM by expressing it in terms of the hinge loss.For a detailed derivation, see With the hinge loss : V\\\\big(y_i, f(x_i)\\\\big) = \\\\big(1 - yf(x)\\\\big)_+, where (s)_+ = \\\\max(s, 0), the regularization problem becomes : f = \\\\underset{f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\operatorname{argmin} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\big(1 - yf(x)\\\\big)_+ + \\\\lambda\\\\f\\\\^2_\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}.

Under the supervision of the Oklahoma Secretary of Education, EQA provides oversight and accountability to the public education services provided through the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The Office of Educational Quality and Accountability is overseen by the seven-member Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability, which is the agency's governing body. The Secretary of Education serves as the chair of the Commission and as the Office's executive officer. The current Secretary of Education is Phyllis Hudecki, who was appointed by Governor Mary Fallin in 2011. The Office of Educational Quality and Accountability is set to be established January 1, 2013. ==Overview== The Office of Educational Quality and Accountability serves as the independent oversight and accountability agency for the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The Office monitors the Education Department's programs to ensure local school districts are performing in accordance with State standards. The Office's mission focus is divided into two mission areas: Educational Quality through teacher preparation and training and Accountability through performance reviews *Educational Quality - The Office is responsible for implementing the Oklahoma Teacher Preparation Act by approving and accrediting teacher education programs and through the assessment of candidates seeking teacher certification. To implementing this mission, the Office, with input from the State Education Department, reviews and assess approved, accredited and new programs of teacher education, and encourage studies and research designed to improve teacher education *Accountability - The Office is responsible for administering the Oklahoma Educational Indicators Program (OEIP) and the Oklahoma School Performance Review Program (OSPRP). Under OEIP and in cooperation with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the Office develops and implements a standardized performance measure to gauge the performance of local school districts. Under OSPRP, the Office conducts performance reviews of local school districts to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of their budget and operations, either due to low performance or as requested by the Governor of Oklahoma. ==History== The Office of Accountability was created in 1990 to oversee school performance and the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation was created in 1995 to establish standards for teacher candidates. In 2012, Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin signed SB 1797 into law, consolidating the two agencies into the single Office of Educational Quality and Accountability.Governor Fallin Signs into Law Educational Accountability Measure, Office of Governor Fallin, State of Oklahoma, 2012-05-08 SB 1797 placed the new Office under the authority of the Oklahoma Secretary of Education. Pursuant to SB 1797, the new Office will be established on January 1, 2013, at which time the former Office of Accountability and Commission for Teacher Preparation will be dissolved. ==Budget and staff== As of the passage of SB 1797 in May 2012, the Oklahoma Legislature has yet to approve a budget for the new State agency. In accordance with SB 1797, all monies and personnel of the former Office of Accountability and Commission for Teacher Preparation will be transferred to the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. For Fiscal Year 2012, the combined budget of the former agencies is $5.5 million while the combined authorized employee levels are 12 FTE.FY 2012 State Budget, Oklahoma Office of State Finance ==See also== *Oklahoma Secretary of Education *Oklahoma State Department of Education ==References== Office of Educational Quality and Accountability Office of Educational Quality and Accountability ","title":"Oklahoma Office of Educational Quality and Accountability"},{"id":"35857181","text":"The Cardenas Basalt, also known as either the Cardenas Lava or Cardenas Lavas, is a rock formation that outcrops over an area of about 310 km2 (120 mi2) in the eastern Grand Canyon, Coconino County, Arizona. The lower part of the Cardenas Basalt forms granular talus slopes. Its upper part forms nearly continuous low cliffs that are parallel to the general course of the Colorado River. The most complete, readily accessible, and easily studied exposure of the Cardenas Basalt lies in Basalt Canyon. This is also its type locality.Hendricks, JD, and GM Stevenson (2003) Grand Canyon Supergroup: Unkar Group. In SS Beus and M Morales, eds., pp. 39-52, Grand Canyon Geology, 2nd ed.

Geology. 11(3):177–181. The Cardenas Basalt is part of the Unkar Group. The Unkar Group is about thick and composed, in ascending order, of the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, Shinumo Quartzite, Dox Formation, and Cardenas Basalt. In ascending order, the Cardenas Basalt is overlain by the Nankoweap Formation, about thick; the Chuar Group, about thick; and the Sixtymile Formation, about thick. The Grand Canyon Supergroup, of which the Unkar Group is the lowermost part, overlies deeply eroded granites, gneisses, pegmatites, and schists that comprise Vishnu Basement Rocks.Elston, DP, and EH McKee (1982) Age and correlation of the late Proterozoic Grand Canyon disturbance, northern Arizona.

Note horizontal bedding (with interbedding) of the Dox Formation; also cliffs of Tapeats Sandstone below greenish slopes of the Bright Angel Shale. ==Description== The Cardenas Basalt is about thick and is typically divided into lower and upper units. The lower unit ranges in thickness from and forms low, talus covered slopes. It consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone. Within the lower part of the Cardenas Basalt, the basaltic lavas are highly fractured and weather into rubble that is about in diameter. The lava within this unit consists of pahoehoe lava flows of olivine-rich basalt. Within the lower part of the Cardenas Basalt, the lava is highly altered and might have been glassy at one time. Near the top of the lower unit the basalt is more massive and less altered. The hyaloclastite is highly altered, and contains secondary chlorite, epidote, talc, and zeolites. Although this unit is highly altered and weathered, many of the primary features are preserved. Thin discontinuous sandstone beds are interbedded with lava flows and hyaloclastite. The brown, maroon, purple sandstones consist of texturally immature, planar-bedded, poorly sorted quartz and feldspar in a matrix of mica and clay. The coarser grains range from medium sand to silt.Timmons, JM, KE Karlstrom, MT Heizler, SA Bowring, GE Gehrels, and LJ Crossey (2005) Tectonic inferences from the ca. 1254-1100 Ma Unkar Group and Nankoweap Formation, Grand Canyon: Intracratonic deformation and basin formation during protracted Grenville orogenesis.

(downstream view, ~west/southwest) ( high resolution expandable photo - Note:massive sections of Cardenas on both sides of river) The upper unit of the Cardenas Basalt is a series of cliff- forming basaltic and andesitic lava flows that are interbedded with beds of breccia, sandstone, and lapillite. It is about thick and contains four to six, prominent lava flows that range in composition from quartz tholeiite to tholeiitic andesite (icelandite). Some of the lava flows are fan-jointed, ropy, and have porphyritic to aphanitic and vesicular textures. The sandstones within the upper part of the Cardenas Basalt contain eroded fragments of lava and have been baked by overlying lava flows. The lapillite bed ranges in thickness from a few meters to several tens of meters and consists of scoriaceous lapilli, volcanic blocks, and volcanic bombs. The basaltic and andesitic dikes and sills that occur within the strata underlying the Cardenas Basalt are similar in mineralogy and chemistry to the Cardenas volcanic rocks. This suggests that these intrusive and extrusive rocks are coeval and share a common source. The sills range in thickness from a few tens of meters to as thick as 300 m. The dikes typically are much thinner and locally follow fault planes. == Nature of contacts== The basal contact of the Cardenas Basalt with the underlying Dox Formation is smooth, planar, parallel to bedding and locally interfingering. In places the sandstones of the Dox Formation have small folds and convolutions that are indicative of soft sediment deformation. In addition, in places, the uppermost of the Dox Formation is mildly baked. A thin lava flow occurs within the uppermost part of the Dox Formation. Thus, the contact between the Cardenas Lavas and the Dox Formation is conformable and interfingering. This indicates that sands were still being deposited when the first lavas erupted and that deposition occurred during the transition from the accumulation of Dox Formation to Cardenas Basalt.Timmons, JM, J. Bloch, K. Fletcher, KE Karlstrom, M Heizler, and LJ Crossey (2012) The Grand Canyon Unkar Group: Mesoproterozoic basin formation in the continental interior during supercontinent assembly. In JM Timmons and KE Karlstrom, eds., pp. 25-47, Grand Canyon geology: Two billion years of earth's history. Special Paper no 294, Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado. The contact between the Cardenas Basalt and the overlying Nankoweap Formation is an erosion surface that is a disconformity or even a slight angular unconformity. Locally, the contact is a low relief erosional surface associated with a thin weathering zone developed in the lavas of the Cardenas Basalt. Along the length of the outcrop of this unconformity, it cuts as much as down into the Cardenas Basalt. The lowest part of the Nankoweap Formation consists of a basal conglomerate that is composed chiefly of gravel derived from the Cardenas Basalt. The contact between the Tapeats Sandstone and the Cardenas Basalt and rest of the folded and faulted Unkar Group is a prominent angular unconformity. The differential erosion of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite as topographic highs, ancient monadnocks, that are now buried by sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the Tonto Group. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone and other members of the Tonto Group. == Fossils== No fossils have been reported from the sediments interbedded within the Cardenas Basalt. ==Depositional environment== The lava flows of the Cardenas Basalt represent the subaerial eruption of basaltic and andesitic magma. The interbedded sandstones and hyaloclastites provide evidence that these eruptions occurred in wet coastal environments such as river deltas or tidal flats. The coarseness of the lapillites in the upper unit indicates that the volcanic vents from which this material erupted were close to present day outcrops. The character of the individual flow units suggest that the volcanic strata accumulated at a slightly greater rate than basin subsidence. ==Age== Geologists have attempted to date the Cardenas Basalt for many years. On the basis of other geologic criteria, geologists have found that the dates, which range from 700 to 1,000 million years ago, obtained for the age of the Cardenas Basalt and upper age of the Unkar Group were too young and something was clearly perturbing the dating systematics. The current interpretation is that the deposition of the overlying Chuar Group in a marine setting disrupted the potassium-argon (K-Ar) radiometric system. Apparently, fluids associated with the deposition of the Chuar Group have altered the older Cardenas Basalt, partially degraded the minerals, and therefore disrupted the K-Ar systematics. Using newer dating techniques and approaches not available to earlier geologists, the Cardenas Basalt and intrusive sills have been re-dated. New data acquired using newer dating techniques and approaches, indicate that the Cardenas Basalt erupted about 1,104 million years ago. This date marks the end of Unkar time. ==Tanner Trail, Lava Butte== Lava Butte in front of the massive Chuar Butte The Tanner Trail from Desert View point region to the Colorado River, has views north to the Colorado River and Lava Butte, which is made of the Cardenas Basalt and is one of the ancient topographic highs (monadnocks) and lies directly north. Temple Butte, the Palisades of the Desert, is on the East Rim, to the right (east) of Lava Butte. The buttes lie on the west bank of the Colorado River as it flows due-south on the east, southeast side of the Kaibab Plateau, (Cape Royal at Walhalla Plateau).

The brewery was founded in 1791 and was owned and operated by the same family till its seventh generation decided to sell to AB InBev in September 2016. Bosteels brew three beers: Tripel Karmeliet, DeuS, and Pauwel Kwak. ==Tripel Karmeliet== Tripel Karmeliet in a glass Tripel Karmeliet (Dutch for \\"Tripel Carmelite\\") is a golden Belgian beer with 8.4% alcohol by volume brewed by Brouwerij Bosteels in Buggenhout, Belgium. It was first brewed in 1996 and uses three cereals: wheat, oats and barley. It is brewed according to a 1679 recipe derived from the old Carmelite convent in Dendermonde. The beer is then bottled unfiltered, a process known as bottle- conditioned. As a result of high demand after winning the Best Pale Ale at the World Beer Awards in 2008,World Beer Awards 2008Tripel Karmeliet – World Beer Awards sales increased unexpectedly in 2009 and numerous pubs didn't have enough delivered. To meet the new demand, production was increased by 30% with the addition of a new brew vessel, accounting for an additional annually. Te weinig Tripel Karmeliet Tripel Karmeliet has also been given two awards in the \\"Best Belgian-Style Tripel\\" category at the World Beer Cup: gold in 1998, and silver in 2002. Tripel Karmeliet has a complex gold to blond colour, with a little head. This is partly due to the cereals but also to the limited use of Styrian hops, the abundant herbs and fruity aroma (banana and vanilla) of the used yeast. This beer has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats, and it also has a spicy, lemony dryness almost reminiscent of quinine. ==DeuS== DeuS, or Brut des Flandres, is a Bière de Champagne with 11.5% abv served in 75cl bottles. During the brewing process, it is fermented over a month with two yeasts, re-fermented near Épernay in Champagne, France, and then bottled, after which it is left in a cellar for 9 months and rotated for a week, and then the yeast removed. The process of the second fermentation and storage is also referred to as the \\"Méthode Champenoise\\" or \\"Méthode Traditionnelle\\". ==Pauwel Kwak== Kwak beer served in its traditional glass Pauwel Kwak is an amber ale brewed since the 1980s with 8.4% abv. Supposedly it is named after an 18th-century innkeeper and brewer, Pauwel Kwak. The beer is filtered before packaging in bottles and kegs.The Oxford Bottled Beer Database As with many other Belgian beers, Kwak has a branded glass with its own distinctive shape.Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Down on your knees to bless monks' top ale It is held upright in a wooden stand; the brewery claims the glass was designed by the innkeeper Pauwel Kwak in the early 19th century for coachmen who would stop at his coaching tavern and brewery named \\"De Hoorn\\", though the beer and the glass were not launched until the 1980s.Jackson, Michael, Great Beers of Belgium, Regional Specialties, pp 277–278, ==References * *Brewery Bosteels Brewery and beer details from BeerTourism.com Category:Belgian brands Category:Breweries of Flanders Category:Companies based in East Flanders Category:Buggenhout Category:InBev brands ","title":"Bosteels Brewery"},{"id":"35857252","text":"New York orthohantavirus or New York virus is an Orthohantavirus.

J Med Virol. 1995 May;46(1):35–39. == Natural reservoir == While several species are responsible for Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever syndrome (HFS) and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), each species of hantavirus is unique to a single reservoir. This makes host evolution and geography important factors in understanding transmission and prevention of spread of disease to humans.Klein SL, Calisher CH.Emergence and persistence of hantaviruses.Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2007;315:217–52. == Transmission == BCCV, like other species of hantavirus, is transmitted via droplet respiration when rodent excreta becomes aerosolized. The greater the concentration of rodent excreta, as occurs in seasonal use structures such as sheds, vacation cabins, and camp grounds, the greater the likelihood of transmission and infection. The Dade County patient is thought to have contracted the previously undocumented BCCV in the seven weeks prior to his hospitalization. The 33 year old man resided in a semirural area of southern Dade County. The residence was surrounded by grassy fields observed to have active rodent populations of several species. The patient reported observing rodents in both his home and the fields immediately surrounding the residence. == Case Study Dade County == Patient was hospitalized in October 1993 with sepsis, acute kidney injury, acute rhabdomyolysis, and suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation: an overactivity of clotting proteins that can lead to eventual hemorrhage as the proteins are degraded. Self-reported history of illness included a four day prodrome of fever, malaise, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and abdominal pain. By the third day of illness, the patient's fever had reached , blood pressure acutely narrow and hypotensive (74/50 mmHg), elevated breathing rate (24 breaths/min), and exhibited abnormal hematological and chemical profiles. Patient went on to develop acute kidney failure along with pulmonary edema, alveolar edema with small pleural effusions, and resulting severe hypoxia. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as supplemental fluids and oxygen. Patient was intubated for a 12 day period and given vasopressor treatment for three days following continued and severe hypotension. Twelve days after admission patient showed extreme improvement in airway management. Peripheral edema spontaneously diuresed. Patient removed from ventilation and discharged 5 days post-extubation in good condition. == See also == *Sin Nombre orthohantavirus *1993 Four Corners hantavirus outbreak == References  External links == *\\"Hantaviruses, with emphasis on Four Corners Hantavirus\\" by Brian Hjelle, M.D., Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of New Mexico * CDC's Hantavirus Technical Information Index page * Viralzone: Hantavirus * Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): Hantaviridae * Occurrences and deaths in North and South America Category:Hantaviridae Category:Zoonoses ","title":"Black Creek Canal orthohantavirus"},{"id":"35857273","text":"The 2012–13 Cypriot Cup was the 71st edition of the Cypriot Cup.

Apollon Limassol won their 7th Cypriot Cup trophy after beating AEL Limassol 2–1 (aet) in the final. ==Format== In the 2012–13 Cypriot Cup, participated all the teams of the Cypriot First Division and the Cypriot Second Division. Teams from the two lower divisions (Third and Fourth) competed in a separate cup competition. The competition consisted of five rounds. In the first round each tie was played as a single leg and was held at the home ground of the one of the two teams, according to the draw results. Each tie winner was qualifying to the next round. If a match was drawn, extra time was following. If extra time was drawn, there was a replay at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. If the rematch was also drawn, then extra time was following and if the match remained drawn after extra time the winner was decided by penalty shoot-out. The next three rounds were played in a two-legged format, each team playing a home and an away match against their opponent. The team which scored more goals on aggregate, was qualifying to the next round. If the two teams scored the same number of goals on aggregate, then the team which scored more goals away from home was advancing to the next round.

Prosecutors alleged that she shot her husband in the head, and then attempted to stage his murder as a suicide. The judge, in the third trial, directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on May 10, 2017. \\"The record taken as a whole does not support a finding of sufficient evidence,\\" Judge Summers said. \\"The state has failed to meet its burden.\\" ==Early life== Raynella Bernardene Large was born on October 25, 1948, to Annie Irene (née Owens) and Dewey Ernest Large, a nuclear scientist and raised in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. She attended Oak Ridge High School and graduated in 1966. She went on to become a registered nurse, and she married her first husband, Ed Dossett, the Knox County District Attorney, in 1970. The couple had three children, and the family lived on a farm west of Knoxville. She held a Tennessee social work license which she agreed to surrender after she was charged with murder. ==Death of first husband== On July 9, 1992, Ed Dossett, who at that time was in the late stages of terminal cancer, was found dead in the couple's corral, supposedly having been trampled by cattle. Despite the medical examiner's suspicions about a double indemnity clause in Ed's life insurance policy, his death was initially ruled to be an agricultural accident by the first medical examiner who autopsied him. Six months after his death, Raynella married her second husband, a retired barber, David Leath. Dossett's death was re-investigated in 2006 after David Leath's death. ==Death of second husband== On March 13, 2003, Raynella found the body of her second husband David Leath in their bedroom. She called 9-1-1 and reported her husband's death as a suicide. The physical evidence suggested that three shots were fired from a .38 caliber Colt revolver, but police argued that it was the second shot that killed David Leath. Following this incident, authorities re-investigated the death of Ed Dossett. A new medical examiner revealed that the morphine levels in his system were \\"so extraordinarily high it is unlikely that any human could function in an ambulatory manner or continue to live\\". In 2006, Raynella was charged with administering an overdose of morphine. Two years later, in 2008, she was charged with the first-degree murder of David Leath. ==Attempted murder charge== In 1995, after the death of her first husband, Raynella discovered that he had an affair with another woman that resulted in the birth of a child. Her late husband's mistress, Kaye Clift Walker, was in the middle of a divorce with Steve Walker; the mistress revealed to Raynella that she had an affair with Dossett and that he had fathered one of her children. Soon after, Raynella lured Walker to her farm, where she allegedly opened fire on Walker until she ran out of bullets. She was charged with attempted murder, but plea bargained to a lesser charge. She served six years on probation and her criminal record was expunged. ==Murder trial== In May 2009, Raynella Dossett Leath went on trial for the murder of her second husband, David. She maintained that his death was a suicide. After hours of jury deliberation, there was no verdict and the judge declared a hung jury. A retrial began in January 2010. The prosecutor began his opening statement by playing Raynella's 911 call, then explaining why David's death was murder rather than suicide. The prosecutor said three shots were fired and the second shot killed David instantly. He also told the jury that David was also drugged with a combination similar to that used for patients undergoing surgery. In this trial, Raynella's defense argued that David's death was in fact a homicide, but that Raynella had an alibi. After a day of deliberation, the jury had not reached a unanimous verdict. However, on January 25, 2010, Raynella Dossett Leath was convicted of first-degree murder and was automatically sentenced to between 51 years and life in prison. Immediately following her conviction, the charges relating to her first husband's death were dropped. ==Aftermath== Following her conviction, Raynella appealed for a new trial on the basis of Judge Richard Baumgartner's judicial misconduct relative to his drug use. She cited the murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom case, which resulted in all of the defendants' convictions being overturned. She was released in May 2016 pending a retrial in January 2017. In the retrial special judge Paul Summers waited for all evidence to be presented and then declared that insufficient evidence had been presented that Raynella was the murderer and did not permit the jury to decide the case. ==In popular culture== True crime author Diane Fanning published Her Deadly Web in 2012 about the Raynella Dossett Leath case. Her case was first profiled on Deadly Women on November 18, 2011, and subsequently on Snapped on June 17, 2012, and Deadly Sins on January 26, 2013. On September 30, 2017, the TV show \\"48 Hours\\" profiled her and her 2017 murder trial in the episode \\"The Widow on Solway Road,\\" names in reference to where her farm is located in Knoxville. == References == Category:1948 births Category:American female murderers Category:American female criminals Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Living people Category:People from Oak Ridge, Tennessee Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Tennessee Category:Mariticides ","title":"Raynella Leath"},{"id":"35857321","text":"Linda L.

It is a triangle center and it is designated as the center X(99) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. Jakob Steiner (1796–1863), Swiss mathematician, described this point in 1826. The point was given Steiner's name by Joseph Neuberg in 1886. ==Definition== The line through A parallel to B'C' , the line through B parallel to C'A' , and the line through C parallel to A'B' concur at the Steiner point. The Steiner point is defined as follows. (This is not the way in which Steiner defined it.) :Let ABC be any given triangle. Let O be the circumcenter and K be the symmedian point of triangle ABC. The circle with OK as diameter is the Brocard circle of triangle ABC. The line through O perpendicular to the line BC intersects the Brocard circle at another point A' . The line through O perpendicular to the line CA intersects the Brocard circle at another point B' . The line through O perpendicular to the line AB intersects the Brocard circle at another point C' . (The triangle A'B'C' is the Brocard triangle of triangle ABC.) Let LA be the line through A parallel to the line B'C' , LB be the line through B parallel to the line C'A' and LC be the line through C parallel to the line A'B' . Then the three lines LA, LB and LC are concurrent. The point of concurrency is the Steiner point of triangle ABC. In the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers the Steiner point is defined as follows; Alternative construction of the Steiner point :Let ABC be any given triangle. Let O be the circumcenter and K be the symmedian point of triangle ABC. Let lA be the reflection of the line OK in the line BC, lB be the reflection of the line OK in the line CA and lC be the reflection of the line OK in the line AB. Let the lines lB and lC intersect at A″, the lines lC and lA intersect at B″ and the lines lA and lB intersect at C″. Then the lines AA″, BB″ and CC″ are concurrent. The point of concurrency is the Steiner point of triangle ABC. ==Trilinear coordinates== The trilinear coordinates of the Steiner point are given below. :( bc / ( b2 − c2) : ca / (c2 − a2) : ab / (a2 − b2 ) ) := ( b2c2 csc(B − C) : c2a2 csc(C − A) : a2b2 csc(A − B) ) ==Properties== #The Steiner circumellipse of triangle ABC, also called the Steiner ellipse, is the ellipse of least area that passes through the vertices A, B and C. The Steiner point of triangle ABC lies on the Steiner circumellipse of triangle ABC. #Honsberger stated the following as a property of Steiner point: The Steiner point of a triangle is the center of mass of the system obtained by suspending at each vertex a mass equal to the magnitude of the exterior angle at that vertex. The center of mass of such a system is in fact not the Steiner point, but the Steiner curvature centroid, which has the trilinear coordinates \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi - A}{a} : \\\\frac{\\\\pi - B}{b} : \\\\frac{\\\\pi - C}{c}\\\\right). It is the triangle center designated as X(1115) in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. #The Simson line of the Steiner point of a triangle ABC is parallel to the line OK where O is the circumcenter and K is the symmmedian point of triangle ABC. ==Tarry point== The line through A perpendicular to B'C' , the line through B perpendicular to C'A' , and the line through C perpendicular to A'B' concur at the Tarry point. The Tarry point of a triangle is closely related to the Steiner point of the triangle. Let ABC be any given triangle. The point on the circumcircle of triangle ABC diametrically opposite to the Steiner point of triangle ABC is called the Tarry point of triangle ABC. The Tarry point is a triangle center and it is designated as the center X(98) in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The trilinear coordinates of the Tarry point are given below: :( sec ( A + ω ) : sec (B + ω ) : sec ( C + ω ) ), :::where ω is the Brocard angle of triangle ABC. := ( f( a, b, c ) : f( b, c, a ) : f( c, a, b ) ), :::where f( a, b, c ) = bc / ( b4 \\\\+ c4 − a2b2 − a2c2 ) Similar to the definition of the Steiner point, the Tarry point can be defined as follows: :Let ABC be any given triangle. Let A'B'C' be the Brocard triangle of triangle ABC. Let LA be the line through A perpendicular to the line B'C' , LB be the line through B perpendicular to the line C'A' and LC be the line through C perpendicular to the line A'B' .

The 19th century scholar Sheikh Ali bin Hasan al-Biladi says in his book Anwar al-Badrain that after the failed coup, al-Sitri attempted to revitalize the rebellion against Sheikh Isa through gaining foreign support. In order to achieve this, Al-Sitri met with the ruler of Persia, Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar, who assured him that he would be on his side as that country belongs to Persia. However, the Qajar Persian government was powerless to give aid at the time due to European colonization and the subsequent rise of semi- independent political entities throughout Iran. Thus, al-Sitri was inclined to meet with the ruler of Shiraz to support his venture of overthrowing the Hakim of Bahrain.Anwar al-Badrain. Page 242. However, as the Bahraini government received news of al-Shirazi's correspondence with the Iranians, they bribed the ruler of Shiraz with gifts and money to co-opt him from a cooperation with Al-Sitri. So when al-Sitri went to Shiraz, the ruler of that area did not meet with him and did not look upon what he wanted to tell him. Sayyid Shubar died fourth months later in Shiraz. == Aftermath of coup attempt == The failed coup d'etat had bloody consequences, \\"many of the people of Bahrain were apparently killed in this rebellion\\". Numerous Bedouin tribes fled the bloodshed through migrating to Qatar (then under Ottoman hegemony), thus renouncing their status as subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrain. During this time period, the Ottomans were battling the Al Khalifas for control of Zubarah, as the Khalifas did not commit to vassalage under the Ottomans. This led to the Porte sending 400 Turkish troops in a warship to conquer Zubarah. The Ottomans then utilized the migrant Bedouin tribes from Bahrain to invade that island, with newly conquered Zubarah as their base for the invasion. The migrant tribes, \\"led by the Al Bin Ali and supported by the Ottomans\\" prepared to invade Bahrain in 1895 with a \\"large number\\" of boats, \\"armed and prepared for sea\\". The British repelled the invasion force before it took place, destroying or capturing many ships. The Bedouin tribes, led by the Al Bin Ali, subsequently sued for peace and the migrant tribes' threat to Bahrain neutralized. == Works == He wrote some works on Islamic (Shi’ite) jurisprudence, creed and other Islamic topics, which include: *Mi’rājut Tahqīq ilā Miāhajet Tasdīq.

Swaffelen was named as the word of the year in the Netherlands and Belgium in 2008. The act of swaffelen often takes place in the form of teasing, crude humour or a degrading context, but can also be a sexual act. When the act is practised on a person, it is often the person's cheek that is hit with an erect penis. ==Origin== The term \\"swaffelen\\" is believed to have originated in English- speaking areas. It is believed to originate from Dutch words meaning swing, sway and swoop, as well as the German words for tail or penis (Schweif and Schwanz). ==Media coverage== In April 2008, the term received wide media attention in the Netherlands and Belgium, Algemeen Dagblad, 14 april 2008: Zaak 'swaffelaar' erg opgeblazen.\\" when a Dutch student committed the act on the Taj Mahal and uploaded the video to YouTube.

In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that \\"In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium.\\" The \\"pioneering program\\" made Poole a \\"surprise star\\". Marcel LaFollette argues that contemporary science television such as NOVA and the Discovery Channel are derived from the innovations of Poole and others. Poole was born in Eagle Grove, Iowa. He received his bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University in 1936, and a master's degree in 1937. In 1938 he joined the staff of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where he directed the education department. In 1941 he married Gray Johnson, then working as a journalist at The Evening Sun. Following service during World War II as a public relations officer for the VII Bomber Command, in 1946 he joined Johns Hopkins University as its first director of public relations. ==The Johns Hopkins Science Review== Poole began producing the weekly, live television program The Johns Hopkins Science Review in 1948. Poole was not educated as a scientist, but he nonetheless wrote most of the programs, and acted as its on-air host and interviewer. As LaFollete describes it, he was a \\"new phenotype\\" and \\"created the persona of the scientist's facile promoter and authoritative interpreter.\\" Each week's half-hour show typically introduced one or more guests, often from the Johns Hopkins faculty and staff. The guest might show how a scientific apparatus such an electron microscope or an oscilloscope worked, or would briefly explain scientific ideas to the viewers. In the December 5, 1950 episode, the live broadcast of a fluoroscope screen was used by doctors in New York and Chicago to diagnose the injuries to a machinist in the hospital in Baltimore. This show demonstrated the medical possibilities both of the fluoroscope and of television itself.Lucanio and Coville (2002) discuss this show at length, pp. 112–113. In the April 21, 1952 episode, a scientist drank a solution containing the radioactive isotope of iodine, and then followed its progress in his own body with a Geiger counter. Poole occasionally did demonstrations himself, such as eating a grasshopper on live television. The guests included national figures like rocket scientist Wernher von Braun (October 20, 1952). Some shows served as conduits for public information, as in the show of April 3, 1951 on biological warfare, which featured Norman Kiefer of the Federal Civil Defense Administration. Lucanio and Coville have written, \\"What is unique about the series is that in a time of political and social conservatism, Science Review tackled controversial issues with a seeming lack of concern for any possible repercussions. While other shows sidestepped the use of the word \\"pregnant\\", for example, Science Review was amazingly forthright in showing the first live birth on television. In a related episode, Science Review presented a straightforward program demonstrating to women viewers how to examine themselves for breast cancer, and then went on to talk frankly about mastectomies.\\" From 1950 to 1955, the program was syndicated nationally by the DuMont Television Network, and won Peabody Awards in 1950 (honorable mention) and 1952. Poole produced three successor series through 1960, when Johns Hopkins ended production. Kinescope films survived for many episodes of these series, which is unusual for early live television. Copies have been archived at the Johns Hopkins library. Poole documented the techniques he developed for television programming devoted to science in a 1950 book, Science via Television. LaFollette notes that, \\"Production approaches that are now standard practice on NOVA and the Discovery Channel derive, in fact, from experimentation by television pioneers like Lynn Poole and Don Herbert and such programs as Adventure, Zoo Parade, Science in Action, and the Bell Telephone System's science specials. These early efforts were also influenced by television's love of the dramatic, refined during its first decade and continuing to shape news and public affairs programming, as well as fiction and fantasy, today.\\" ==Writing career== Poole was also a prolific author, mostly of popular and young adult books about science. An early title related to several episodes of the Science Review program was Your Trip into Space (1953). A second volume that was noted in The New York Times was Science: The Super Sleuth (1954), which was about forensic science. Paid access. Many of his books were published after his television work ceased in 1960. Poole and his wife Gray Johnson Poole wrote at least 16 nonfiction books together, beginning in 1960 with Scientists Who Changed the World, published by Dodd, Mead in its Makers of Our Modern World series. The Pooles also published at least one novel, The Magnificent Traitor; a Novel of Alcibiades and the Golden Age of Pericles (1968). One Passion, Two Loves; the story of Heinrich and Sophia Schliemann, discoverers of Troy (Crowell, 1966) is their work most widely held in WorldCat libraries. Poole retired from Johns Hopkins in 1965, but continued his writing career. Poole died of a heart attack in 1969, at the age of 58. He'd had the first of several heart attacks in 1957, and of course had published a book, I am a Chronic Cardiac (1964), about his experiences. Gray Poole wrote at least four more books that were published during the 1970s. The de Grummond Children's Literature Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg holds an unprocessed collection of the papers of Lynn and Gray Johnson Poole.

In a phylogenetic context, younginids are near the base of the clade Neodiapsida. Younginidae includes the species Youngina capensis from the Late Permian of South Africa and Thadeosaurus colcanapi from the Late Permian and Early Triassic of Madagascar. Heleosuchus griesbachi from the Late Permian of South Africa may also be a member of the family. Younginidae was traditionally assigned to Eosuchia, an order containing an assemblage of basal diapsids now thought to represent an evolutionary grade rather than a true clade. In 1945 paleontologist Alfred Romer reclassified Younginidae within a new group, Younginiformes, grouping it with the families Tangasauridae and Prolacertidae. Romer considered Younginidae to include many genera that are no longer classified as younginids: Paliguana, Palaegama, and Saurosternon are now considered basal lepidosauromorphs, Galesphyrus and Heleosuchus are diapsids of uncertain affinities (incertae sedis), Heleophilus is now a millerettid, and Heleosaurus is now thought to be a varanopid synapsid. Like Eosuchia, Younginiformes is no longer considered valid; for example, the phylogenetic analysis of Reisz et al. place younginids close to Sauria, the clade including the still-living archosauromorph and lepidosauromorph reptiles, while the younginiform family Tangasauridae takes a more basal position in Neodiapsida.

It is defined as taking great care concerning what should be adopted and what should be avoided.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 634-635.Kunsang (2004), p. 24. In the Pāli Canon, a collection of the Buddha's earliest teachings, the term appamāda is quite significant and the essence of the meaning can not be captured with one English word. \\"Heedfulness\\", \\"diligence\\", and \\"conscientiousness\\", are all words that capture some aspects of appamāda. It is identified as one of the eleven virtuous mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings. ==Etymology== The word is a negation of pamāda, which means \\"negligent\\" or \\"lax.\\" Appamāda, therefore, means non-negligence, or non-laxity, correctly translated as \\"heedfulness\\", or whichever word fully captures the mood of the term. \\"Heedfulness\\", \\"diligence\\", and \\"conscientiousness\\", all captures certain aspects of the word. ==Explanation== The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is concern? From taking its stand on non-attachment (alobha), non-hatred (adveṣa), and non-deludedness (amoha) coupled with diligence (vīrya), it considers whatever is positive and protects the mind against things which cannot satisfy. Its function is to make complete and to realize all worldly and transworldly excellences. Alexander Berzin states:Berzin (2006) : A caring attitude (bag-yod, carefulness) is a subsidiary awareness that, while remaining in a state of detachment, imperturbability, lack of naivety, and joyful perseverance, causes us to meditate on constructive things and safeguards against leaning toward tainted (negative) things. In other words, being disgusted with and not longing for compulsive existence, not wanting to cause harm in response to its suffering, not being naive about the effects of our behavior, and taking joy in acting constructively, a caring attitude brings us to act constructively and to refrain from destructive behavior. This is because we care about the situations of others and ourselves and about the effects of our actions on both; we take them seriously. Robert Thurman emphasizes the high degree of apramāda of someone who has realized emptiness (a.k.a. \\"voidness\\"):Thurman (2008), p. 158. : This denotes a type of awareness of the most seemingly insignificant aspects of daily life, an awareness derived as a consequence of the highest realization of the ultimate nature of reality. As it is stated in the Anavataptaparipṛcchasutra: \\"He who realizes voidness, that person is consciously aware.\\" \\"Ultimate realization,\\" far from obliterating the relative world, brings it into highly specific, albeit dreamlike, focus. This term is described at length in chapter four of the Bodhicharyavatara. ==Alternate translations== * A caring attitude (Alexander Berzin) * Carefulness (Alexander Berzin) * Conscious awareness (Robert Thurman) * Conscientiousness * Concern (Herbert Guenther) * Prudent ==Importance== To really get an understanding of the range of the word appamāda, we have to examine it in the context of key sutta (Buddha's discourse) passages. The important point is that Appamāda (\\"Heedfulness\\") not only leads to perfection of ethical conduct (which on its own only leads to heavenly rebirth), but to all the various skillful methods taught in the Buddha's dispensation that culminate in the realization of nibbāna (transcending the entire cycle of endless rebirth and death). Appamāda (\\"Heedfulness\\") is the source of all skillful qualities. AN 10.15 has a series of similes all with this refrain: ...all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them. In the passage below, the Buddha, exhorting his followers for the last time before dying, advised them to be \\"heedful\\", and then demonstrated complete mastery of the 9 meditative attainments in forward and reverse order. In other sutta passages such as the chapter of Appamāda of the Dhammapada, the context makes it clear that Appamāda (\\"Heedfulness\\") is to be developed in a way leading to mental mastery, meditative attainments, culminating in nibbāna. Before the Buddha passed (death) into final nibbāna, his last advice to the order of monks: [SN 6.15 pari-nibbāna Sutta] Atha kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi: handa dāni bhikkhave āmantayāmi vo vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethāti. Ayaṃ tathāgatassa pacchimā vācā. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, \\"Now, then, monks, I exhort you: All fabrications are subject to decay. Bring about completion by being heedful (Appamāda).\\" Those were the Tathāgata's last words. (The Buddha then goes into 9 meditative attainments in forward and reverse order before passing) == See also == * Buddhist meditation * Mental factors (Buddhism) * Mindfulness ==References Sources == * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Guenther, Herbert V. & Leslie S.

The group was signed to RedOne's 2101 Records and to Capitol. ==Career2009–12: Formation and beginning=== Midnight Red was originally formed by Eric Secharia, Anthony Ladao, and Thomas Augusto. Secharia and Augusto auditioned for the 2007 rebirth of popular boy band Menudo. The group recruited Joey Diggs Jr. from a referral by a fellow producer, while Colton Rudloff was found on YouTube. In 2009, after relocating to California, the group formed FLYTE. The group caught the eye of one of the music producers of RedOne, who worked with Akon, Lady Gaga, Pitbull, and Jennifer Lopez, among other artists. Once signed to Interscope Records, the group renamed itself Midnight Red. In the video for \\"Body Talk\\", Augusto says \\"Midnight is that time that everyone wants to sneak out and party, and red is a very dominant, 'in your face' color and it represents what Midnight Red wants to do with its music.\\" Red is also part of their name, in honor of REDone. In the spring of 2011, Interscope released Midnight Red's self-titled EP on iTunes. The EP featured their first song \\"One Club at a Time\\", which was used for FOX's So You Think You Can Dance for National Dance Day, as well as a cover of \\"Step by Step\\" by New Kids on the Block. The group received rave reviews as the opening act on the NKOTBSB Tour in the summer of 2011. After the tour the group flew to Paris in December 2011 to continue recording material for their debut album. The group performed for many events including Larry King's \\"Guard a Heart\\" Pre Grammy Performance, opening for Carly Rae Jepsen at Universal City Walk, and Young Hollywood-Uneeqability. Their first official single, \\"Hell Yeah\\", has received airplay on Minnesota's Mix 94.9 KMXK FM and was released for radio in the latter half of May 2012. The video for the single was shot in April 2012 in California and was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who has worked with artists like Taylor Swift and One Direction.\\"Hell Yeah\\" was released to iTunes on June 19, 2012. ===2013–present: Midnight Red=== Midnight Red released their single \\"Take Me Home\\" on July 16, 2013.

The single was produced by RedOne and recorded in Los Angeles, CA. \\"Take Me Home\\" was also featured in a Coca-Cola commercial that ran in movie theaters nationwide. Midnight Red signed to Capitol Records in June 2013 through a joint venture with 2101 Records. They released their debut self-titled EP on December 10, 2013. To promote their single, Midnight Red performed in a number of holiday shows in the United States, following a successful radio tour. In 2014, the band was chosen as Elvis Duran's Artist of the Month and appeared on NBC's Today show with Hoda Kotb and Kathy Lee Gifford performing \\"Take Me Home\\". As the band calls their fans \\"redheads\\", the hosts Hoda and Kathy Lee were shown wearing red wigs while the band performed an acoustic version of the song live. Also in 2014, Midnight Red toured with Austin Mahone on MTV's Artist to Watch Tour. This tour consisted of stops across the eastern United States in 10 cities and other acts included Becky G and W3 The Future.

The same instrument is played by the Mansi people (formerly known as Vogul), and is known as sangkultap (or sangvyltap, санквылтап) in the Vogul language. Various names and spellings include: naresyuk, nars-yukh, naras-yux, nars-juh, nares-yuk, possibly nanus narsus, panan-juh, or shongoort. ==Construction and playing== In the traditional form, the hollow body of the instrument is carved from a single piece of wood (fir or cedar) around 100 cm long. One end is pointed and the other is forked into two arms which carry a crossbar to hold the tuning mechanism. The soundboard is around 0.5 cm in thickness and covers the whole of the body except the forked end. A bridge is fitted, towards the pointed end of the body. A soundpost is fitted inside the instrument, between the back of the body and the soundboard, to provide support at the position of the bridge. There are typically five strings of tendon or gut. Wood or bone tuning levers are used to tension the strings by pulling them around the crossbar. The strings are tuned diatonically, to a major or minor pentachord. These lyres are also distinguished by the placing of pebbles within the resonating body, causing a rattle. Modern examples may have metal strings, an increased number of strings, tuning pegs or pins, and a body which lacks the forked end. The nares-jux is played with a blocking technique: the player strums the strings with the right hand and uses the fingers of the left hand to damp those strings which are not intended to sound. ==See also== *Khutang, an arched- angular lap-harp of the Khanty and Mansi *Tonkori, a similarly-shaped long five-string zither of the Ainu people of northern Japan ==References== Category:Lyres Category:Russian musical instruments Category:Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug ru:Санквылтап ","title":"Nares-jux"},{"id":"35857599","text":"Jannusan (Arabic: جنوسان) is a village in Bahrain, near Sar.

The college is located in the area of San Isidro. It was founded by the Irish Christian Brothers who still provide staff. The motto of the college is \\"Fight the Good Fight\\" (in Latin: Certa Bonum Certamen) which is taken from St. Paul's first letter to Timothy in which Paul writes \\"fight the good fight of faith to win for yourself eternal life\\" (Timothy 6:12).\\" The Christian Brothers seek to educate men with the vision of his founder, Edmund Ignatius Rice (1762–1844). \\"Honesty, loyalty, solidarity, and deep moral values; give them the strength to fight for good causes, with honor and moral integrity\\". The college is an important centre for Rugby union in Argentina and Club Newman has close connections with it.Cardenal Newman (retrieved 31 May 2016) ==Origins== The college was founded in 1948 as the result of many years' effort by the Irish immigrant community in Argentina to obtain a pastoral and education ministry from the Irish Catholic Church. The Passionists had arrived in the mid-19th century and one of their priests, Father Fahy, who had established a boys’ school in 1860, suggested then that the Christian Brothers should take it over. However, this request was refused by the order because they were concentrating their efforts in the United States and, later, in Australia and New Zealand, where much greater numbers of Irish people had migrated. In 1946, Father Dominic Moore, provincial of the Passionist Order, visited the Superior of the Christian Brothers in Dublin, and once again promoted a new foundation in Argentina. His request was accepted, and in November 1947, Brothers Joseph Ignatius Doorley (founder of various schools in USA) and Cornelius O’Reilly arrived in Buenos Aires. Father Moore found a suitable building in Belgrano 1548 and the new school was named after Cardinal Newman. Colegio Cardenal Newman was opened on the Belgrano site on 29 March 1948. The national education programme in Spanish was followed during the morning, allowing the afternoons to be devoted to English. Brother Alphonsus L. Pakenham was the first Rector. He presided over a community of 7 brothers, 8 lay teachers, and 148 students, 27 of whom were boarders. In 1949 the roll increased to 200 boys and there \\"would have been more had there been more vacancies\\".María José Roger, \\"The Children of the Diaspora: Irish Schools and Educators in Argentina, 1850-1950\\", Society for Irish Latin American Studies (retrieved 22 May 2012) The Christian Brothers encouraged the playing of Rugby UnionBrother Sean Hayes, \\"Why did the Christian Brothers choose Rugby?\\", Club Newman website (Retrieved 2 February 2018) and so began a great tradition at the college which led also to the founding of Club Newman in 1975. ==Development== In 1971 the college changed its location to San Isidro where a new complex was built on a large campus with ample space for sports fields and other facilities.\\"Historia del Colegio Cardenal Newman\\", Colegio cardenal Newman website (Retrieved 24 January 2018) The college offers wide curricula and extra-carricula choices. == Rectors == * Brother Alphonsus L.

The action was part of a larger operation in which the French tried to trap Ballesteros but failed. Instead, the Spanish general lashed out at one of the French columns. The French escaped disaster when they fought their way out, but a French-allied Spanish battalion either surrendered or switched sides. Bornos is about northeast of Jerez de la Frontera on Route 342. The battle occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. ==Background== In the fall of 1811, the British navy transported Francisco Ballesteros and a small army to Algeciras. The Spanish force marched inland on another one of many forays. The French commander in Andalusia, Marshal Nicolas Soult was irritated by the continual raiding of his territory by Ballesteros and he determined to catch the clever Spanish general.Gates (2002), 277 ==Battle== To trap Ballesteros, Soult organized three columns under General of Division Nicolas Godinot, General of Division Pierre Barrois, and General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Pierre de Semellé.Rickard (2008), Combat of Bornos In July 1811, Godinot commanded the 2nd Division of the I Corps, with a strength of 8,133 men in 13 battalions.Gates (2002), 504 Godinot set out from Seville while Barrois and Semellé left the Siege of Cadiz lines. Ballesteros detected the converging French forces and raced south to Gibraltar where he found refuge. On 14 October, 10,000 French troops arrived in front of Gibraltar. Lacking the supplies for a siege, the French retreated the next day. Godinot tried to march on Tarifa but his troops were bombarded by British warships as they marched on the coast road. Giving up the attempt, he withdrew to Seville. Blamed for the operation's failure, Godinot later committed suicide. On 5 November, Ballesteros marched to Bornos where he surprised Semellé, who commanded 1,500 men of the 16th Light Infantry and a French-allied Juramentados battalion. Semellé and the 16th Light cut their way out of the trap, but the Juramentados either surrendered or defected en masse during the fighting. The 16th Light suffered 100 casualties in the combat. Since Semellé commanded 2,300 men, including 1,500 French, presumably the lost Juramentados battalion counted 800 men. Ballesteros led a force consisting of both regular and irregular elements. Spanish strengths and casualties in the action were not given.Smith (1998), 368-369 ==Second Bornos== A second Battle of Bornos occurred on 31 May 1812 when Ballesteros surprised Nicolas François Conroux's troops in the town. The outnumbered French fought back effectively and drove off the Spanish troops with serious losses.Gates (2002), 361 ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Battles of the Peninsular War Category:Battles in Andalusia Category:Battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Battles involving Spain Category:Battles involving France Category:Conflicts in 1811 Category:November 1811 events ","title":"Battle of Bornos (1811)"},{"id":"35857816","text":"Hound Run Airport is a privately owned, public use airport located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) north of the central business district of Hallettsville, a city in Lavaca County, Texas, United States. == Facilities and aircraft == Hound Run Airport covers an area of 96 acres (39 ha) at an elevation of 385 feet (117 m) above mean sea level.

The airfield is located in Luskintyre, approximately north west of Maitland. The airfield site has an area of and is home to the Luskintyre Aviation Flying Museum; and is primarily used for the restoration of vintage aircraft, particularly de Havilland Tiger Moths. The museum has the largest fleet of operational Tiger Moths in Australia. There are five hangars on the property used for storage and restoration. ==History and events== A Tiger Moth similar to those under restoration at Luskintyre The airfield was established in 1977 with the aim of restoring and operating vintage aircraft. A company specialising in the repair and restoration of early de Havilland aircraft was later established and has operated from a hangar on the airfield for over 30 years. On 1 May 1994, a visiting Tiger Moth lost engine power and crashed while performing a wing walking demonstration at Luskintyre. Both the pilot and the wing-walker were killed in the accident. In October 2003, Tiger Moths from Luskintyre participated in The Great Tiger Moth Air Race, an event celebrating 100 years of powered flight and sponsored by aircraft manufacturer Airbus. In September 2010, the airfield hosted flying displays and events coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the first de Havilland aircraft. 'Lunch with the Tiger Moths' is a regular event held on the first Saturday of each month (weather permitting). The event allows visitors to inspect airworthy and under-restoration Tiger Moths and view the museum's collection of memorabilia. Many recreational pilots as well as professional pilots use the airfield. It is also frequented by aerobatic champion Paul Bennet, and his formation flying team the SkyAces. ==See also== * de Havilland Australia * List of airports in New South Wales ==References * Luskintyre Airfield - official site Category:Airports in New South Wales Category:Transport museums in New South Wales Category:Aerospace museums in Australia Category:Air transport in the Hunter Region Category:Maitland, New South Wales Category:Airports established in 1977 Category:Museums established in 1977 ","title":"Luskintyre Airfield"},{"id":"35857836","text":"Zu is a small genus of ribbonfishes with currently two recognized species: * Zu cristatus (Bonelli, 1819) (scalloped ribbonfish) * Zu elongatus Heemstra & Kannemeyer, 1984 (taper-tail ribbonfish) The scalloped ribbonfish is found around the oceans of the world in the tropical latitudes, but the taper-tail ribbonfish is limited to the southeast Atlantic. ==References== Category:Lampriformes ","title":"Zu (fish)"},{"id":"35857864","text":"Map of Manama in 1926.

It is published by Eklavya foundation, a non-profit, non-governmental organization that focuses on children's education. Sandarbh primarily serves as a resource on a variety of topics for teachers and students in primary, middle, and high schools. In addition to feature articles, analyses of curricula and pedagogies, reviews of text-books and children's literature, biographies, interviews, teacher's experiences, and fiction also find space in the magazine. In every issue there is also an attempt to publish answers to questions in science sent in by readers - Sawaliram. The magazine covers articles on various topics in education, social studies art, literature, language, botany, zoology, evolution, chemistry, physics and mathematics. Articles published in this magazine are written in a relatively casual, non-textbook style without compromising on accuracy and rigour. Sandarbh means 'context' in Hindi, and the articles provide a relevant context for learning topics covered in schools in India. ==History== The idea of a magazine in Hindi that could serve the needs of teachers and students in schools was first conceived in the early '90s. Members of the Eklavya foundation had been part of a pioneering science education programme in over 1000 middle schools in Hoshangabad and other districts of Madhya Pradesh, known as the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme (HSTP). To provide a platform for teachers and resource persons associated with HSTP, a bulletin was started in 1983. Based on their experiences over many years in science teaching and the HSTP Bulletin, many felt that such material should be available to teachers and those interested in education, also those outside HSTP. The magazine was initially supported by the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development, under its Science Improvement Scheme. In subsequent years subscriptions have covered the publishing costs of Sandarbh with support from Eklavya's other programmes when necessary. ==Readership== The nearly 7000 subscribers of Sandarbh consist of school and college teachers, teacher educators, some students as well as general readers. While most of the subscribers reside in the Hindi speaking states of India, some are scattered across the country. ==Articles and contributors== Contributing writers to Sandarbh come from all over the country. They also include members of the editorial team of the magazine and resource persons associated with various Eklavya programmes. While many write in Hindi, articles submitted in English and other languages are also translated and published. The majority of articles published in Sandarbh are written for the magazine. A smaller but significant number come from other publications. They tend to be articles that may be interesting and useful to Sandarbh readers but which, for various reasons, may be beyond their reach. Likewise, articles from Sandarbh are carried by other publications, both in Hindi and other languages. ==Sandarbh in other Indian languages== In 1998, a Pune-based organization \\"Palak Neeti\\" began publishing Shaikshanik Sandarbh in Marathi. Till now 74 issues of this magazine have been published. Since 2003, 21 issues of Sandarbh have also been published in Gujarati by \\"Arch Vahini\\" in Dharampur, Gujarat. They are both independent, fraternal ventures that collaborate with the Hindi Sandarbh on magazine content. == References  * Sandarbh online archive * NCERT list of Indian Journals * Online store to purchase Sandarbh magazine Category:1994 establishments in India Category:Bi-monthly magazines published in India Category:Education in Madhya Pradesh Category:Education magazines Category:Hindi-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1994 Category:Mass media in Madhya Pradesh Category:Science and technology magazines published in India ","title":"Sandarbh"},{"id":"35857896","text":"The khutang (literally \\"swan\\", also called Ostyak harp, kiotang, sotang, shotang) is a type of harp played by the Khanty and Mansi people of Siberia.

They released an independent EP, The What What What EP, before signing to Tooth & Nail Records and releasing a second EP, American Dream EP and a debut full-length, Secrets Don't Make Friends, which was produced by Matt Grabe and released on April 24, 2012. ==Band historyFormation and first EP (2008-2010)=== Lead Singer Brandon Ellis and Drummer Peter Kalinowski co-founded Rocky Loves Emily. They knew of each other in the local music scene but met for the first time while on tour with different bands at a show somewhere in Minnesota. They kept in contact, and when their former bands broke up they started Rocky Loves Emily. One day Pete Kalinowski, Stephen Hull, and Brandon Ellis had lunch together discussing band names. Pete Kalinowski and Steve Hull came up with the band name. \\"We were talking about old 90's movies that we remembered watching as kids. I remember Steve saying, did you guys ever see 3 ninjas, I immediately started chanting Rocky Loves Emily and paused and said that's it! That's our band name!\\" -Peter Kalinowski. Taking their name from a line in the 1992 film 3 Ninjas. A debut EP entitled What What What was released to iTunes in July of that year. The band spent the next several months touring, most notably playing acoustic shows at Hot Topic stores, and was a finalist in Alternative Press's January 2010 \\"Hometown Heroes\\" competition. ===Signing and American Dream EP (2010-2011)=== In April 2010, the band had a day off in Seattle and attended Copeland's Farewell Tour, the band encountered an A&R; executive from Tooth & Nail Records and ended up giving him a copy of their EP.

Following this and a tour with Freshman 15, Brandon Ellis announced that the band was in the process of writing their first full-length album for Tooth & Nail, stating that it would be \\"a step in a new direction for us as a band...I feel a lot of growing up has happened in the past year and that will definitely be expressed in the new music. Bottom line, I cannot wait for people to hear this, I've never been more excited about music in my life.\\" A music video for the title track was released on March 14. Following that, a second SXSW appearance as part of an HM Magazine showcase, and three more singles (one of which was given an exclusive release by AbsolutePunk), the album, Secrets Don't Make Friends, was released on April 24, 2012.

Matt Collar of AllMusic described Secrets Don't Make Friends as containing \\"power pop-influenced rock tunes\\" and a delivery that matched the band's \\"emo-pop aesthetic\\". Drummer Pete Kalinowski has defined the band's sound as \\"pop, rock, with just a pinch of country/classic rock.\\" He also revealed that the band originally started with a \\"weird grungy/indie sound\\" before settling into pop, admitting that they \\"didn't really know what we were trying to go for\\" at the time. === Influences === Brandon Ellis has said that his songwriting is influenced by Tom Petty and Bryan Adams: \\"I really like the songwriting structures...the way their guitar riffs and vocals fit together. I think they set the tone for a lot of bands today whether [those] bands realize it or not.\\" Kalinowski lists Kiss, Foo Fighters, Neil Young, Soundgarden, and Def Leppard among his personal influences. Ellis has also noted the influence of the band's collective Christian faith: \\"I do think that because I’m a Christian and we’re all Christians, regardless of whether we try not to make our music Christian...it just bleeds through because it’s who we are. I feel like it’s going to happen regardless of what I try to set out to do because God’s in me.

Unlike other districts in the Manama Souq, Fareeq el-Fadhel used to be inhabited by Omanis, Indians (especially the Buhra) and Jewish families, alongside the Baharna. Although it used to be a predominantly Bahrani Shi'a district, according to Ahmad Matar, both Shi'a and Sunnis mourned Imam Hussain and celebrated other religious and national celebrations together.http://www.alahdnews.com/content.php?action=news&newsid;=4382&issue;_id=78 ==See also== *Muharram in Bahrain ==References== Category:Neighborhoods of Manama ","title":"Fareej el-Fadhel"},{"id":"35858017","text":"Joculator introspectus is a species of minute sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Cerithiopsidae.Joculator introspectus at World Register of Marine Species.

It had been recorded from a series of performances from 2004 to 2010 on Kelly's A – Z Tours in various locations. The tours led to Kelly writing his memoir, How to Make Gravy (named for the song of the same name), also in September 2010. Kelly's A – Z Tours continued until March 2012. Rolling Stones Jason Cohen described the release as \\"a 106-track, eight-CD boxed set culled from Kelly's now-trademark A to Z live performances\\" and, with the associated memoir, Kelly \\"might be creating the world's longest CD liner notes\\" at 568 pages. ==Background== alt=56-year-old Kelly is standing at a microphone with his guitar slung over his shoulders. His right arm is bent at the elbow towards the viewer, while his left is at his hip. He wears a grey suit with an orange shirt. The A – Z Recordings originate from a series of acoustic concerts by Australian rock musician, Paul Kelly starting in December 2004 with 100 songs performed alphabetically over four nights at The Famous Spiegeltent in Melbourne. In November–December 2006 Kelly undertook his A – Z Tour at the Brisbane Powerhouse, Melbourne's Spiegeltent, and at the Sydney Opera House. On his A – Z Tours, over subsequent years to 2010, Kelly was often accompanied by his nephew, Dan Kelly, on guitar and vocals and sometimes by his then- girlfriend, Sian Prior, on clarinet and vocals. For some of his North American shows, he cut back his performance to only one or two nights, \\"the speed-dial version\\". Kelly would provide anecdotes or background for each song, which led to his writing a memoir, How to Make Gravy (named for the song of the same name), issued in September 2010. The book contains a chapter per song with the lyrics supplied followed by Kelly's description of varied topics. According to Rolling Stones Jason Cohen, Kelly \\"might be creating the world's longest CD liner notes\\" at 568 pages. It was released in \\"tandem with The A to Z Recordings, a 106-track, eight-CD boxed set culled from Kelly's now-trademark A to Z live performances\\". The boxed set was issued on 24 September 2010 by Gawd Aggie Records in Australia and Universal Import in North America. In October that year, the book and boxed set were packaged together and issued as How to Make Gravy: The A – Z Recordings. In January 2011 The Sydney Morning Heralds Bernard Zuel caught the first two nights of a four night set, he disputed the \\"accepted wisdom that acoustic performances were the test of a song's lasting quality\\" and preferred when Kelly's nephew Dan \\"add[ed] colour guitar or extra vocals to particular songs\\" or when Prior \\"provided scattered 'furnishings', playing clarinet, briefly bringing some operatic vocals to the party and noticeably brightening proceedings\\". Zuel felt the first night was \\"lacking some energy, vocal and physical\\" and that \\"the show's highlights came in the purely solo songs about or from the perspective of women\\". Kelly's A – Z Tours continued until March 2012. ==Composition and recording== In November 2011, The A – Z Recordings were featured in two parts on The Weekend Planet program on Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) with Doug Spencer presenting tracks \\"beside another artist's utterly different (often, wordless) take on the same subject, or closely related theme\\". Spencer described some of the collection's tracks: \\"Adelaide\\" is a \\"21st century 'live' version of a song Paul wrote early in the 1980s, when his former home- city was a fresher 'wound'\\". For the song Kelly \\"sings and strums acoustic guitar, with nephew Dan Kelly's electric guitar\\". \\"Cities of Texas\\" is \\"spare – Paul's voice, [acoustic] guitar and harmonica – in the persona of the wind\\". Kelly's inspirations are seeing Dallas from the front of a tour bus in 1987 and reading Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet Ozymandias. \\"Don't Explain\\" is \\"a deliciously wry song, in persona of an older woman, brushing off her 'toy boy'. Kelly, solo – voice and [acoustic] guitar\\". It was written as an answer song to Billie Holiday's 1946 track of the same name. \\"Lately\\" is \\"as close to 'croon-ville' as Paul Kelly gets\\", and is partly inspired by Frank Sinatra's songbook. Kelly's singing and chordal acoustic guitar, is joined by Sian Prior's clarinet. \\"If I Could Just Start Today Again\\" is regarded by Kelly \\"as his 'most precise', most perfectly proportioned song. He says he has no idea how he wrote it, 'without thought or struggle'\\". For the track he sings and fingerpicks his guitar. On \\"I Can't Believe We Were Married\\" he is joined by Dan on harmony vocal. Spencer finds \\"Dumb Things\\" is a \\"very exuberant version, 'live' with [Kelly's] vocal and whooping and [acoustic] guitar, with [Dan] playing up a storm on ripe [electric] guitar\\". The second program showcased \\"Winter Coat\\" which Spencer declared was \\"a superbly written, bittersweet song, in which the coat lives on, long after the departure of the lover who bought it for him\\" with Kelly playing solo. While \\"You Can Put Your Shoes Under My Bed\\" addresses \\"a somewhat errant longtime friend/ former flame\\" with Kelly providing vocals, piano and harmonica. His rendition of \\"Maralinga (Rainy Land)\\" is a \\"[v]ery good performance of an extraordinary song. It adopts the personae of two of the (many) indigenous Australians who were irradiated when Britain dropped atomic bombs into South Australia's desert country in 1957 and 1958\\". Kelly is joined by Dan on electric guitar and backing vocals. \\"Shane Warne\\" is perceived as a \\"nicely silly calypso- cricket song about Shane Warne. [Prior] plays the clarinet. [Kelly] borrowed the tune from Lord Kitchener's \\"London is the Place for Me\\". \\"Smoke Under the Bridge\\" tells the story of its protagonist, 'Banjo' Clark, \\"a young black man in mid-century rural Australia ... [who, later] was well-known, widely respected and much loved\\". It was delivered as an \\"intimate, quiet song, performed solo\\". \\"Meet Me in the Middle of the Air\\" was performed a capella with the title \\"common to various blues, gospel and spiritual songs. The other words come from Psalm 23\\". \\"My Way Is to You\\" is a \\"[v]ery haunting song and performance. Kelly sings and plays acoustic guitar. Nephew and co-author Dan plays atmospheric electric guitar. The lyric is – by design – equally open to 'entirely secular' and to 'sacred' interpretations\\". \\"Other People's Houses\\" has the lyrics spoken instead of sung – except the choruses. Spencer feels it is \\"[b]eautifully written, eventually blurring the 'he' and the 'I' and the 'child, then' and the 'adult, now', still haunted thirty years later\\". In a 2002 interview with Debbie Kruger, Kelly indicated that the song, \\"To Her Door\\" (1987) took seven years to write. Kelly uses the same protagonist in \\"Love Never Runs on Time\\" from 1994's Wanted Man and then in 1996's \\"How to Make Gravy\\" from the extended play of the same name. All three tracks appear on The A – Z Recordings. ==Track listing== All tracks are written by Paul Kelly except as shown. *The A – Z Recordings parallels Kelly's memoir, How to Make Gravy, however, \\"[t]wo songs, 'This Land Is Mine' and 'Treaty' are not included in the box set as they defy stripped-back reworking\\". ==Personnel== Musicians * Paul Kelly – acoustic guitar, harmonica, lead vocals, piano * Dan Kelly – electric guitar, vocals, ukulele * Sian Prior – clarinet, vocals (on six tracks) Production details * Paul Kelly – producer ==References== ;General * ;Specific Category:Paul Kelly (Australian musician) albums Category:2010 live albums ","title":"The A – Z Recordings"},{"id":"35858050","text":"Heat Wave is an album by American jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal featuring performances recorded in 1966 and released on the Cadet label.Ahmad Jamal discography accessed May 18, 2012 ==Track listing== # \\"Heat Wave\\" (Irving Berlin) – 3:35 # \\"April in Paris\\" (Vernon Duke, E.

Fareej Mushbir (Arabic: فريج مشبر) is an old district neighbouring the Manama Souq, in the city of Manama, Bahrain. The district was part of the original core of Old Manama, prior to its expansion in the 20th century. It was established in the early 19th century by Iranians living in that country. ==Mushbir canal== The area is most famous for the Mushbir canal (also called the Manama Canal), part of a series of ancient canals lining the north of Bahrain, which was the most important source water supply in the capital. Predominately Shia neighbourhoods grew around the canal, local folklore suggests that it led to the formation of the current Mushbir district and the Hammam district, then an agricultural hamlet. It also led to the establishment of the two oldest religious institutions in Manama; the Jami' al Mu'min (first mentioned in 1738) and Matam bin Aman, where Ashura processions are organised. It is also believed that, during the 1783 Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain, the Mushbir canal was used by the Bani Utbah to capture the Persian-held Diwan Fort, then the administrative headquarters of Bahrain. ===Disuse=== The canal fell into disuse as did much of the country's old canal system during the 19th and 20th century. However, vegetation continued to grow around the canals. In 1904–1905, a wave of cholera and plague struck Bahrain, killing hundreds. It was thought that the canals harboured deadly microbes and it was transmitted in clothes people washed in the canals. Historian Mohammed Ali Al-Tajir described Manama at the time as \\"the land of Manama consists of marshes and swamps that pollute the air with increasing epidemics\\".

He along with Boubacar Messaoud founded the human rights organization to abolish slavery in Mauritania. ==Life== As a 7 year old Abdel, was given the choice between gifts, and he choose to assume ownership of Yebawa Ould Keihel, a young dark skinned boy. Despite their bond, formed from childhood and nursing together, the two boys had been thrust into a master-slave relationship, and were prevented from fraternizing. While studying in Nouakchott, Abdel received a thorough education while living a nomadic life style. One notable aspect of Abdel's education, was his quirky European tutor who assigned Abdel to the French Cultural Center, to supplement his education. While studying there, he became enamored by something he read in a text about the French revolution: This saying would soon take on greater significance to Nasser over the next few years, as it began an awakening that would forever alter his values. After a period of reflection, he consulted with his father for advice. Abdel discovered that his father not only encouraged his dissent from this custom, but in the past had tried to free his slaves, only to be met with resistance from the slaves themselves. Abdel, now able to contextualize the circumstances which allow for slavery to be perpetuated in his country, began to denounce slavery. He trained himself to do the basics, everyday tasks which were once performed by his slaves. ===International Work=== Abdel is a UN advisor to the office of West Africa. He is also a member of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council. ==SOS Slaves== In 1995, Abdel founded SOS Slaves with Boubacar Messaoud, a former slave. Together they sought to end the practice of slavery in Mauritania, which had already been illegal since 1981. Both men have been arrested and beaten in their attempt to convince both the slave owning class, and blacks, of the wrongness of slavery. SOS Slaves published the stories of slaves who had been freed, in addition to lobbying on the behalf of slaves who had not yet been freed. In 2007 the Mauritanian government voted unanimously to make slave ownership a crime. ==References * The Human Rights Foundation * Oslo Freedom Forum Category:Mauritanian human rights activists Category:Mauritanian activists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Abdel Nasser Ould Ethmane"},{"id":"35858086","text":"Cohen & Grigsby is a United States-based law firm with over 140 attorneys.

The show debuted on the Nine Network on 2 September 2012. Set in Melbourne, House Husbands stars Firass Dirani, Gyton Grantley, Rhys Muldoon and Gary Sweet as four fathers who stay at home to raise their children. The program also focuses on their interconnected families and friends. In 2013, House Husbands won Most Popular Drama Series at the 2013 Logie Awards. In February 2018, Nine confirmed the series would not be returning for a sixth season and was officially cancelled. ==ProductionConception=== On 6 May 2012, the Nine Network announced it had commissioned House Husbands, a ten-part comedy-drama about the issues of changing gender roles. The series focuses on four modern families where the men are in charge of raising the children. Nine's director of television, Michael Healy, stated \\"House Husbands is a fresh and dynamic look at Australian family life, with a very modern twist. Audiences will fall in love with our characters as they deal with the challenges of raising families in today's hectic world.\\" House Husbands was conceived by Ellie Beaumont and Drew Proffitt. It was directed by Geoff Bennett and Shirley Barrett with Jo Rooney, Andy Ryan and Playmaker Media's David Maher and David Taylor serving as executive producers. House Husbands received funding from Screen Australia and filming on the series commenced at the end of May. On 23 September 2012, Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald reported Nine had renewed House Husbands for a second series. The network's director of television, Michael Healy, stated \\"I couldn't be happier that Australian audiences have taken House Husbands to their hearts and made it the number one drama in the country. I am thrilled to confirm a second series of House Husbands will go into production with the same acclaimed cast and crew.\\" Filming for the second series took place from 4 February to 6 June 2013. Series two began airing from 8 April 2013. In June 2013, House Husbands was picked up for a third season, which began airing in 2014. The Nine Network and Playmaker Media confirmed that all of the cast members would return. In July 2014, the Nine Network renewed House Husbands for a fourth season to air in 2015. The four male leads, as well as Morris and Saleeba, returned. On 23 May 2016, TV Tonight reported that filming would begin in the last days of May, with all the main cast returning except for Gyton Grantley. On 28 October 2015, the Nine Network announced via Facebook that House Husbands had been renewed for a fifth season. The fifth season was set to air in 2016 but that August, Nine delayed the season to air on 6 February 2017. On 4 February 2018, it was confirmed that Nine had officially cancelled the show after five seasons. The network also decided not to go ahead with a potential spin-off centred around Lewis Crabb (Sweet). ===Casting=== Casting of the series was announced on 18 May 2012 with Gary Sweet, Rhys Muldoon, Gyton Grantley and Firass Dirani cast as the house husbands. Sweet stars as Lewis, a successful builder who has become a stay-at-home dad to Matilda, while his partner, Gemma, is a senior nurse at the local hospital. Sweet commented \\"When I first got the House Husbands scripts I just felt like this was something that had legs.\\" Julia Morris and Anna McGahan were cast as Lewis's partner Gemma and daughter Lucy. Muldoon plays Mark and Natalie Saleeba plays his wife Abi. Grantley plays Abi's brother Kane, who is in a relationship with Tom (Tim Campbell) and helping to raise his niece, Stella (Edwina Royce). Kane and Tom mark the first time that an Australian drama has featured a gay couple raising a child. Proffitt commented that Grantley was cast because of his comic timing and Campbell was cast because of his chemistry with the actor. Dirani plays Justin a disgraced former footballer who has broken up with the mother of his three children, Nicola (Leah de Niese). Nicholas Coghlan was cast as Rodney, Nicola's new partner. The main cast members from season one all returned for the second series. Jo Rooney and Andy Ryan, the heads of drama at the Nine Network commented \\"We are thrilled to have House Husbands returning for a second season. With such a strong cast and some great names joining the series, we're excited to be providing more fantastic local drama for our viewers.\\" Series two saw Geraldine Turner and Madeleine West join the cast as Wendy Horne and Dimity respectively. Craig McLachlan began appearing as Damo from episode three. Rick Donald stars as new school teacher, Mr. Tuck, while Kane and Tom welcomed a foster child called Finn, played by Ben Crundwell, into their family. On 14 December 2013, it was announced that Campbell's character had been written out of the show and that he would not be returning for the third season. Campbell was surprised and disappointed with the decision, which came at the last minute. He commented \\"as a fan of the show I'm disappointed that a unique TV family is no more and Tom would leave his partner and children suddenly off screen. Don't blame me, I'm just the actor.\\" A spokeswoman for Nine added that there would be other casting changes ahead of filming for the third season. The following month, it was announced that Lincoln Lewis had joined the cast as a \\"mysterious character that ignites tension\\" among the families. Actress Rachel Griffiths also joined the cast as Belle, a character \\"who brings friction to the series.\\" Darren McMullen was cast \\"a love interest who ruffles feathers\\". On 26 March 2015, it was announced Justine Clarke had joined the cast for the fourth season. She plays Eve, a rival for Kane. Actors Indiana Evans, Akos Armont and Jane Kennedy also join the cast as single mother Tash, the \\"ambitious\\" Dr Saxon and Belinda, the Director of Medical Services, respectively. Coghlan (Rodney) and Jane Allsop who previously appeared in the first series returned, alongside Danielle Horvat as Frankie from series three. Actor Hugh Sheridan and singer Delta Goodrem joined the cast for the fifth season. Sheridan is Nick Gazecki, a new music teacher who makes an enemy of Lewis. While Goodrem plays Izzy Dreyfus, a reading recovery teacher at the Nepean South Primary School. Her character was billed as \\"both beautiful and slightly tomboyish. She excites and frightens everyone in the House Husbands world.\\" Nancye Hayes and Roy Billing were cast as Mark's parents Liz and Bernie, and Rahart Adams joined as Justin's brother Rafiq. ==Cast and charactersMain=== * Firass Dirani as Justin Baynie * Rhys Muldoon as Mark Oliver * Gary Sweet as Lewis Crabb * Julia Morris as Gemma Horne Crabb * Natalie Saleeba as Abigail \\"Abi\\" Albert * Gyton Grantley as Kane Albert * Jane Allsop as Rachel Hilton (season 1, 4–5) * Hugh Sheridan as Nick Gazecki (season 5) * Delta Goodrem as Izzy Dreyfus (season 5) * Anna McGahan as Lucy Crabb (seasons 1–3) * Georgia Flood as Phoebe Crabb (seasons 1–3) * Tim Campbell as Tom Parker (seasons 1–2) * Leah de Niese as Nicola Panas Baynie (seasons 1–2) * Lincoln Lewis as Ned (season 3) * Rachel Griffiths as Belle Crabb (season 3) * Darren McMullen as Alex Larden (season 3–4) * Justine Clarke as Eve (season 4) ===Supporting=== * Louise Siversen as Heather Looby * Lily Jones as Poppy Oliver * Madison Torres-Davy as Tilda Crabb * Allegra Volange as Angie Baynie * Fletcher Grant as Jacob Baynie * Riley Webb as Zac Baynie * Danielle Horvat as Frankie (season 3–4) * Ava and Audrey Bellert as Sophie Oliver (season 3–5) * Edwina Royce (season 1–3) and Jade Knight (season 4) as Stella Parker * Nicholas Coghlan as Rodney (season 1, 4) * Kate Jenkinson as Miss Nadir (season 1) * Madeleine West as Dimity (season 2) * Rick Donald as Mr. Harry Tuck (season 2) * Les Hill as Simon Lawson-West (season 2) * Terence Donovan as Doug (season 2) * Ryan Johnson as Will (season 3) * Ben Crundwell as Finn (seasons 2–4) * Ben Schumann as Ryan (seasons 2–3) * Helen Dallimore as Gaby (season 2-3) * Craig McLachlan as Damo (season 2–3) * Geraldine Turner as Wendy Horne (season 2–3) * Denise Scott as Nurse Toni (season 4-5) ==EpisodesReception== Of House Husbands, Graeme Blundell from The Australian wrote \\"It's a nice premise for a show, a kind of Aussie Modern Family and, while not as stylish, or stylised for that matter -- it's underplayed in a kind of low-key naturalism -- its producers similarly lace the family shenanigans with real emotion to balance the humour. Directed with flair by Geoff Bennett, it's a nicely paced character-based comedy-drama constructed from the comings and goings of, as one of the characters says, a bunch of 'useless parents having a crack'.\\" Blundell went on to say that the show is \\"far removed from the childish shenanigans\\" of Two and a Half Men and is not as soapy as Packed to the Rafters, a show that it could replace as \\"TV's favourite family hour\\". He added \\"Sure, there's a blokey edge to House Husbands though, so far at least, it's never lascivious, sexist or plain dumb.\\" The first episode of House Husbands averaged 1.376 million viewers overnight, which was a ratings record. It also ranked first in the 16-39, 18-49 and 25-54-year-old demographics. Holly Byrnes from the Herald Sun reported that the show became the number one new Australian drama and a popular subject on social networking site Twitter, where it trended in Australia and gained praise from viewers who dubbed it Underbelly: Dads.

The current light is the second to be built on the headland, superseding the original which now forms part of the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses. ==History== The original light at Kinnaird Head Lighthouse was established by Thomas Smith on 1 December 1787. A lantern was set above the sea on a tower of the old castle. Whale oil lamps produced a fixed light, each backed by a parabolic reflector. Kinnaird Head was the most powerful light of its time, and contained 17 reflectors arranged in 3 horizontal tiers. It was reported to be visible from . In 1824, internal alternations were made to construct a new lighthouse tower through the original castle tower. This tower supported a new lantern and reflector array by Robert Stevenson (civil engineer). In 1851 Robert's son, Alan Stevenson, installed a first order dioptric lens at Kinnaird Head. The lens was standing and gave a fixed character. The site was further improved in 1853 with the site's first purpose built accommodation blocks designed by brothers David and Thomas Stevenson. David Alan Stevenson further upgraded the site in 1902 by installing a flashing lens apparatus. The hyperradiant fresnel lens gave one flash every fifteen seconds and was visible for 25–27 miles. The lens was designed by David and his brother Charles Alexander Stevenson, and was made by the Chance Brothers. Only nine Scottish lights were given hyperradials, Hyskeir and Kinnaird Head being the only stations to retain their hyperradials today. A foghorn was also built and was operational from 1903 giving a 7-second blast every 90 seconds. In 1906 the light was converted to incandescent operation. In 1929 Kinnaird Head became home to the first radio beacon in Scotland. The Fog Signal was discontinued in 1987, although the horn is still in place. The original lighthouse is no longer operational and is now home to The Museum of Scottish Lighthouses. A new automatic light was established beside the original light in 1991. In 2012 the old Kinnaird Head Lighthouse was lit for two anniversary celebrations. First, on 2 June 2012 the light was exhibited in celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. This coincided with the lighting of the NLB's Queen's Diamond Jubilee Beacon at Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. Secondly, the light was exhibited on 1 December 2012 in celebration of Kinnaird Head's 225th anniversary. The light was lit at 3.31pm, and extinguished at 8.30am the next morning, marking a full 17-hour shift. On that occasion Kinnaird Head was the only manned lighthouse in the British Isles, albeit outwith NLB service. Both events were organised by the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses. ==See also== * List of lighthouses in Scotland * List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses ==References External links == * Northern Lighthouse Board * Museum of Scottish lighthouses * Panorama from the lantern room (QuickTime required) Category:Lighthouses completed in 1787 Category:Category A listed lighthouses Category:Towers completed in 1787 Category:Lighthouses in Scotland Category:1787 establishments in Scotland Category:Lighthouse museums in the United Kingdom Category:Museums in Aberdeenshire ","title":"Kinnaird Head Lighthouse"},{"id":"35858107","text":"The 2012 Samford Bulldogs football team represented Samford University in the 2012 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

APAC was founded in 1995 with the purpose of providing an \\"interesting, well-rounded extra-curricular program for international schools in the Asia-Pacific area\\". For the years that the APAC events have taken place, there have been sports tournaments and arts exchanges involving international schools from China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Every year a different school in different locations in Asia and the Pacific will host various APAC tournaments, thus students from international schools get the opportunity to travel within Asia-Pacific to not only compete in athletics and in the arts, but also experience new cultures and destinations. Being selected as part of the APAC delegates of a school is a privilege and the chosen participants are usually part of a school's varsity team or the like. ==History== In 1993, activities directors from Brent International School Manila and Canadian Academy met. They discussed the prospect of friendly international competition between their schools. This conversation led to the founding of the Asia Pacific Activities Conference in 1995. This international extra-curricular program started with sports and five schools. Seoul Foreign School joined Brent, Canadian Academy, International School of Beijing, Shanghai American School-Puxi, and Osaka International School as the sixth member in 1997. APAC has strived to offer a well-rounded range of events since its start. First came volleyball, basketball and soccer tournaments. Choir became the first non-competitive event in 1997. The organization added more athletic competitions and performing art exchanges in the following years. (See competitions and performing arts below). APAC events were great opportunities for arts and sports exchange between the schools involved. It garnered the attention of many international schools in the Asia-Pacific area. In 2008, APAC welcomed Hong Kong International School, Shanghai American School-Pudong, Taejon Christian International School, Western Academy of Beijing, American International School of Guangzhou, and Concordia International School Shanghai into the fold. The United Nations School in Hanoi joined in 2010, completing APAC’s expansion to a 12-school format. The intent is to provide participants with a sense of pride and accomplishment for being very mediocre. As for cost, we selected initial values based upon how much money we want and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before the competition. Among other things, we're looking at average per-participant family income rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that participants have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via competing. We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on wikipedia, our forums and across numerous social media outlets. Our administration will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can. ==Participating schools== {  - ! School !!

The hosting school will usually provide accommodation for the visiting APAC teams through homestays, a process where visiting students are assigned to a host-student's house. Each of the mentioned international schools compete in various athletic, arts and music competitions (all called APAC) throughout the school year (August – June). Each competition is hosted by a different school every year, and often because there is such a large number of schools competing in APAC, the tournaments are broken into two tournaments hosting six schools (instead of one tournament hosting twelve schools). ==APAC divisions== For most of the activities, there are two divisions: the Asia and Pacific division. The schools in a division are different every year, so participants will have a chance to meet other people from different schools. Every four years there is a \\"Super APAC\\" conference including all participating schools for the activities where there are two divisions. ==Competitions and Performing Arts== Visual and Performing Arts (Non-Competitive) {  - !

The following times for APAC are by month because there is not usually a concrete date for each and every APAC that will be held, although they always occur within the same month. The corresponding time for APAC for all sports in the first season is October (e.g. Rugby, Volleyball and Tennis), APAC for all sports that are in the second season occurs in February (Basketball), and APAC for all third season sports is in April (e.g. soccer/football and badminton). == External links == Asia Pacific Activities Conference ==References== Category:Asian international sports competitions ","title":"Asia Pacific Activities Conference"},{"id":"35858264","text":"Chris Heaphy is a New Zealand artist who is based in Auckland. His work explores cultural issues with a greater focus on the relationship between Maori and Pakeha due to the artist's background. Chris Heaphy, Maukatere, 2012, acrylic on canvas. Courtesy of the artist and Gow Langsford Gallery ==Early life and education== Chris Heaphy was born in 1965 and is of Ngāi Tahu and European descent. He graduated from the Ilam school of Fine Arts in Canterbury, New Zealand in 1991 where he studied towards a BFA. In 1998, Heaphy completed a MFA in painting at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Over the years, Heaphy was granted several awards and fellowships, including: the Te Waka Toi Grant (1993), the Olivia Spencer Bower Award (1995), the Research Grant Residency, the RMIT University (1998), the Creative New Zealand Grant (1999), and the Veuve Cliquot Ponsardin Residency, Champagne, France (2000–2001). ==His career== Although Chris Heaphy remains concerned with cultural heritage and history, his style has changed over time. Whereas his earlier compositions are subdued in tones, his later work confronts the viewer to vibrant colours. Heaphy's compositions are complex. He introduces an array of motifs drawn from Maori and European iconography demonstrating his interest in cross-cultural exchanges as well as referring to his personal history. His installation After the Big Bang (2003) formed the bridge between Heaphy's previous body of works and his more recent works included in his first solo exhibition Sea of Tranquility at Gow Langsford Gallery that demonstrated Heaphy's new collage-style of paintings which he had started exploring back in 2003. Heaphy stated that his work After the Big Bang: \\"... developed like an inventory of the symbols [he] had used earlier, and it was a continuation of the earlier wall paintings, however it was more about drawing with shadows. The new paintings are a continuation of those ideas.\\" Heaphy is interested in the \\"inevitable change or slippage of meaning of the symbol.\\" According to Heaphy, these symbols represent his identity. Heaphy's bicultural heritage continues to inform his work as seen with his recent exhibition Maukatere at Gow Langsford Gallery. The works in this exhibition presents the viewer with a mixture of Maori and Pakeha symbols brought together in colourful compositions. In addition to his work as a visual artist, Heaphy is also a noted musician, collaborating with fellow guitarist Roy Montgomery on the album 'True'. ==Selected exhibitions== Heaphy has gained national and international recognition through a variety of solo and group exhibitions across Australasia and Europe including: Selected solo exhibitions 2009 Gallery Barry Keldoulis, Sydney, Australia Jonathan smart Gallery, Christchurch, New Zealand 2008 Daisy in my lazy eye, Plum Blossoms Gallery, Hong Kong Sea of Tranquility, Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland, NZ 2007 The End of Nothing, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ 2005 Stereo, Michael Lett, Auckland, NZ After the Big Bang, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ 2004 Michael Lett, Auckland, NZ Stereo, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ 2003 Stereo, Michael Lett, Auckland, NZ 2002 Wonder works, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ 2001 New Works, Cite Gallery, Paris, France 2000 Wonder Works, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ Selected group exhibitions 2008 Sacred XIV, Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland, NZ 2007 Frieze Art Fair, London, Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York City 2006 Triple Candy, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ Turn Off The Century, Pataka Gallery, Porirui, NZ Group Exhibition, Jonathan Smart Gallery, Christchurch, NZ 2005 Ka Kino To Pounamu He Pounamu Onamata, Auckland Art Gallery, NZ Contexts: Being Bicultural in Contemporary Art, Hawke’s Bay Cultural Trust, Napier, NZ Michael Lett, Auckland, NZ 2004 Michael Lett Gallery stand, Melbourne Art Fair, Melbourne, Australia 2003 Changing times in painting, Conny Dietzschold Gallery, Sydney, Australia Slow Light, Curated by Wystan Curnow, Gus Fisher Gallery, University of Auckland, Auckland, NZ 2001 Painted Spaces, Australia Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, Australia Parihaka, City Gallery, Wellington, NZ Accents Australians, Adamski Gallery, Paris, France Painted spaces, Auckland City Art Gallery, New Gallery, NZ ==Selected bibliography== * Cross, David.

The group's leads were Leslie Anne Jordan on vocals and guitar and David Alan Leonard on vocals and piano. They are worship leaders at Journey Church in Franklin, which is a non-denominational church. They have four full- length, commercial album releases, all on the Integrity Music label: Season One, Live, All Sons & Daughters and Poets & Saints. On February 9, 2018, after taking a year off they announced that their \\"season as a band has come to an end\\". ==Background== All Sons & Daughters formed in 2009, signing with their label Integrity in October 2010. They released three EPs, which were Brokenness Aside: EP No. 1, Prone To Wander: A Collection of Hymns EP and Reason To Sing: EP No. 2 that charted at No. 12 on Christian Albums chart and No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums chart, before their first full-length studio album called Season One. The album was released on March 13, 2012. Their second album, Live, was released April 23, 2013. David Alan Leonard, formerly a member of Jackson Waters, decided he wanted deeper and more authentic connection with a planted body of believers. Leslie Anne Jordan had grown up in worship leading settings since high school, where she wrestled with a calling into a full career of ministry. The two were equally devoted to recording music that was authentic and raw. They joined together to write songs that have been called \\"unpolished\\" due to the unedited nature of their music. Both Leslie and David wanted to remain connected to the church body they shared.

His title was royal acquaintance (with right of) access. He is known in Egyptology because his burial was found undisturbed. It was discovered on 21 December 1862 by Luigi Vassalli who worked for Auguste Mariette in Dra' Abu el-Naga' at Thebes. Gaston Maspero published the tomb group in 1892. A. Mariette: Monuments divers recueillis en Egypte et en Nubie par Auguste Mariette-Pacha. Ouvrage publie sous le auspices de S.A. Ismaile Paha Khedivve d'Egypte, Texte par G. Maspero, Paris 1892, pl. 51 The burial contained the rishi coffin of Hornakht and a set of objects, some of them inscribed with the names of other officials some of these objects perhaps gifts to Hornakht. There was a throw stick with the name of king Seqenenre Djehuty-aa (Seqenenre Tao of the 17th Dynasty) also inscribed with the name of the king's son Tjuiu. The object provides an idea of Hornakht's dating. A box bears the name of the mayor Minemhat and there was a cosmetic spoon inscribed with the name and title of the mayor of Hierakonpolis Sobeknakht. These people are all most likely contemporary with Hornakht. A vase bears the name of an Idi and dates most likely to the Old Kingdom. Other objects found in the tomb are scarabs, stone vessels, a pair of sandals, a headrest and a gaming board. Originally, Vassalli assigned the tomb to Tjuiu, but later called the tomb owner Aqhor, as he was reading the name on the coffin. However, most recent scholar read the name on the coffin as Hornakht. Aq is clearly a part of the title and translates as access, while the old reading of the name simply missed the name element nakht.Gianluca Miniaci: Rishi coffins and the funerary culture of Second Intermediate Period Egypt, London 2011, , 58–59, 313 == References == Category:Officials of the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt ","title":"Hornakht (17th Dynasty)"},{"id":"35858390","text":" The Magnanime class was a class of two 74-gun ships of the line built for France in the late 1770s.

They have great potential, and I , for one, can’t wait to hear them grow from here!\\" CCM Magazine's Andy Argyrakis wrote that Samestate has \\"a knack for catchy choruses and mighty melodies, along with a lyrical bent of leading listeners to embrace God's plan for their lives.\\" Christian Music Zine's Joshua Andre wrote that \\"the band have crafted 10 songs of southern goodness\\". In addition, Andre noted that \\"Their alternative rock sound certainly brings a flair and a creativity to the table, and for me to say I was captivated during the 40 minute musical and lyrical journey is an understatement by far. It’s hard not to draw comparisons between Dalton’s raw and unique voice with Bear Rineheart’s [sic], from Needtobreathe, one of the first things striking me as special about this Sparrow Records group.\\" Christianity Today's Joel Oliphint wrote that \\"Samestate has enough hooks and ardor to make a name for itself.\\" Cross Rhythms' Jamie Maxwell wrote that \\"In one sense it all sounds fairly familiar: the songs are fairly standard driving rock numbers that are pleasantly anthemic [sic] without being outstanding, but while Samestate don't bring much that is completely new, they seem to do the stadium-style rock thing better than most. The musicianship here is excellent and the production is of a high standard. Singer Dalton Diehl has a distinctive quality to his voice, intriguingly reminiscent of Marcus Mumford, which lends credence to the well put-together lyrics.\\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre wrote that \\"Samestate’s debut record incorporates a little imagery and symbolism, hope and passionate song-writing, motivation to love our creator and our fellow mankind, but also to understand the full love of Christ with His creation. These ten songs are heartfelt, providing an avenue of reflection and reminders of Christ in a world where little reminders are certainly needed. On a similar vein to either Switchfoot, Aaron Gillespie or Needtobreathe; The Alignment certainly stands tall along with Crave, I Choose Jesus and The Rescue (For King and Country, Moriah Peters, and Adam Cappa respectively) as one of the most compelling debut projects of 2012!\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Roger Gelwicks wrote that \\"Good radio pop is hard to come by, but when a band performs even a little bit above standard expectations, it's a sound to behold. Enter Sparrow Records signees [sic] Samestate; with The Alignment already in full force, it juggles the line between complacent musicmaking [sic] and innovative aptitude, but fortunately for listeners, it opts more for the latter than the former.\\" Furthermore, Gelwicks concluded, when he noted \\"The highlights of Samestate's sound become more and more noticeable upon each listen, and there's evident potential here for a glowing record on the horizon. When great talent and great songwriting align, it reaches beyond just what the radio expects to broadcast; casual radio pop fans will ravenously devour Samestate's inclinations in The Alignment, but with the band's debut in the books, their next venture as a signed band will hopefully be something unmistakably their own.\\" Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies wrote that \\"Every album has different styles of songs but on this album there is actually a rhythm and feel to it that keeps the flow of the whole album together. There are some truly stunning tracks on this album, I mean truly stunning, from the heartfelt raw tracks to the out and out anthems. This what Samestate are about and what a great way to be introduced to this very talented band that really know how to write a beautiful set of songs.\\" New Release Tuesday's Logan Leasure wrote that \\"What Samestate has managed to do is successfully make worship relevant. In a generation of Christian bands that seems to have shifted their focus on making it big in the mainstream, Samestate--whose roots lie in Kansas City--has decidedly stayed true to the profound passion that they so evidently have for their faith.

Notably, entry can be denied to persons who renounced their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying income taxes. The United States is one of two countries in the world that taxes its citizens' income earned abroad for citizens whose primary residence is abroad.The other country to do so is Eritrea. The Amendment was named for its author Jack Reed, and passed into law as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Though the Reed Amendment received strong bipartisan support during the committee stage, Democratic lawmakers including Daniel Patrick Moynihan later criticised it as inappropriate, embarrassing, and badly-drafted. Efforts at establishing procedures to enforce the amendment ran into early difficulties, and the executive branch never promulgated the implementing regulations. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that they cannot obtain the information required to enforce the amendment unless the former U.S. citizen \\"affirmatively admit[s]\\" his or her reasons for renouncing citizenship, and so from 2002 to 2015, only two people were denied entry to the United States on the grounds of the amendment. Various Democratic and Republican politicians including Reed himself, Chuck Schumer, Chuck Grassley, Lamar S. Smith, and others have made many unsuccessful efforts to enact clearer definitions of the classes of former citizens to be banned from re-entry, and to enable executive agencies to share information with each other in order to enforce the ban. ==Overview and legislative history== The Reed Amendment added the following text to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952's list of \\"Classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admissions\\", under the \\"Miscellaneous grounds\\" category: :;(E) Former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation :Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who officially renounces United States citizenship and who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States is inadmissible. This provision is located at INA 212(a)(10)(E) (). It was introduced by then-Representative Jack Reed (D-RI). Reed first introduced his eponymous amendment during the debate on the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995 (). He stated that \\"there's no attempt by this legislation to prevent someone from renouncing their citizenship\\", but that people who did so for purposes of tax avoidance should \\"not be able to return to the United States\\". At the time, the issue of giving up U.S. citizenship for tax purposes was receiving a large amount of media attention, which also resulted in Congress adding provisions to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to broaden the \\"expatriation tax\\" () and to make public the names of people giving up U.S. citizenship. Reed's amendment ostensibly intended to address the issue of wealthy individuals who had renounced U.S. citizenship but then later attempted to obtain residency visas to return to the United States.; also available in PDF form from the website of the Government Printing Office. One example discussed was Kenneth Dart of Dart Container, who had become a citizen of Belize and then attempted to obtain a diplomatic visa to serve as Belize's new consul in Sarasota, Florida. Florida Congressmen Sam Gibbons and Dan Miller both wrote to the State Department to protest, and by October 1995, the government of Belize had withdrawn its nomination of Dart as consul. Wealthy people who renounced U.S. citizenship for tax reasons were estimated to comprise about a dozen of the roughly one thousand people per year who became ex-Americans. The House Committee on the Judiciary approved Reed's amendment by a vote of 25 to 5, over objections from opponents of the law arguing that it was punitive, difficult to enforce, and gave too much discretion to the Attorney General. All 12 Democratic members of the committee, as well as 13 of the 18 Republican members, voted in support; the five opposers were Howard Coble (R-NC), George Gekas (R-PA), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA), Bill McCollum (R-FL), and Lamar S. Smith (R-TX). Another similar bill, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, contained the Reed Amendment in its originally-introduced version, and went on to be enacted on September 30, 1996. ==Reactions== Senator Daniel Moynihan (D-NY) stated that the Reed Amendment \\"does not reflect well on a free society\\". In the aftermath of IIRIRA's passage, Reed's fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan made a speech on the Senate floor denouncing the Reed Amendment in harsh terms, saying: \\"The wording of the statute is embarrassing. How can an alien renounce U.S. citizenship? In what capacity would said alien do so officially? One assumes that a court of law would find the language incoherent and unenforceable ... This is the way we legislate at 5 o'clock in the morning 4 days before adjournment.\\" Moynihan went on to state that it was inappropriate to use visa restrictions to enforce the tax law, called it a provision \\"which does not reflect well on a free society\\", and advocated for the alternative plan of modifying the expatriation tax to tax accrued capital gains instead. Among various academics' and practitioners' criticisms of the law, Renee S. Liu describes it as \\"an inappropriate response\\" to the problem it sought to address, while Michelle Leigh Carter argues that it may \\"unconstitutionally infringe on the fundamental right to expatriate\\". Temple University law professor Peter Spiro also suggested that it conflicts with the Expatriation Act of 1868, as well as the guarantees in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that all people have the right to leave any country and to change their nationality. ==Official and unofficial enforcementGeneral issues=== The U.S. government has never issued regulations to implement the Reed Amendment. One issue with the enforcement of the law was that the Attorney General was never authorized to obtain the required information from the Internal Revenue Service in order to be able to make the determination whether a former American's loss of citizenship was motivated by tax reasons. This restriction arises from . Michael G. Pfeifer of Caplin & Drysdale states that it is unclear whether the Reed Amendment is intended to apply to all persons \\"relinquishing\\" U.S. citizenship by committing an \\"expatriating act\\" with the intention of losing U.S. citizenship (all the acts listed in , including (1) obtaining nationality in a foreign country, (2) swearing allegiance to a foreign government, (3) serving in a foreign military under certain conditions, or (4) working for a foreign government), or only those who specifically \\"renounced\\" by making a formal renunciation of nationality under § 1481(a)(5) or (6). Mark Nestmann of The Nestmann Group states that despite non-enforcement of the Reed Amendment, he advises his clients to avoid making a formal renunciation of nationality, and instead to naturalize as a citizen of a foreign country and then obtain a U.S. Certificate of Loss of Nationality on the basis of having committed an \\"expatriating act\\" under § 1481(a)(1). ===At ports of entry=== Passport control at John F. Kennedy International Airport. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officers decide whether former U.S. citizens arriving in the U.S. are inadmissible based on the Reed Amendment. They have only found two people inadmissible in the past 15 years. According to retired IRS international tax counsel Willard Yates, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service and the IRS' Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International) worked together in an effort to create procedures to work around the limitation. Under their proposal, the Customs Service (now Customs and Border Protection) would have been required to check the names of all aliens appearing at U.S. ports of entry against the list of former United States citizens published by the IRS under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Those who were identified as former U.S. citizens would be required to sign a waiver of their rights under § 6103; Customs would then fax the waiver to the IRS so that the IRS could provide Customs with tax information relating to the former citizen, in particular whether the former citizen met the asset thresholds of , and any private letter ruling regarding whether or not the former citizen had tax motivations for giving up U.S. citizenship. However, there were various practical difficulties with these proposed regulations. Most notably, only one IRS agent would have been assigned to handling such requests; if a former U.S. citizen arrived on a weekend, he or she might have to be detained until Monday in order for border agents to make the required determination of tax motivation, as no IRS staff might be available to respond to the request for information on a weekend. Additionally, the IRS already had a large workload drafting other guidance for former citizens and green card holders under newly passed tax laws. Furthermore, DHS later indicated that even if the department were able to obtain tax information on former citizens, their agents \\"lack[ed] the expertise and resources to review tax filings meaningfully or engage in complicated tax liability analysis, involving both domestic and foreign tax law\\". In the end, the proposed regulations were never issued. In June 2014, Reed used his position on the Senate Committee on Appropriations to insert language into the Senate report on one version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 () directing DHS to report, within 90 days of the act's passage, on the steps it was undertaking to enforce the Reed Amendment, including a schedule for issuing guidance or regulations, if necessary. DHS' report, submitted to Congress in November 2015, stated that \\"there currently are no advisable options for altering enforcement of the inadmissibility ground against persons who do not affirmatively admit to renouncing their U.S. citizenship for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation\\". DHS considered implementing the Reed Amendment by presuming that a former citizen seeking entry had renounced U.S. citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation if he or she failed to pay the expatriation tax, obtained a windfall shortly after renunciation, or established residence in a tax haven, and placing the burden of proof on the individual to rebut this presumption; however, the department concluded that this procedure would have both many false negatives (failing to identify people who renounced for tax avoidance reasons) as well as many false positives (incorrectly denying entry to people who had other reasons for renouncing U.S. citizenship). According to the DHS report, two individuals were denied admission to the United States on the grounds of the Reed Amendment between 2002 and 2015, while another five individuals \\"were identified as possibly inadmissible\\" on that basis but were not removed. Joel Paget of Ryan, Swanson & Cleveland states that one such denial (against a person who renounced before the enactment of the Reed Amendment) was reversed after the renunciant's lawyer submitted a legal brief to CBP. ===In the visa application process=== The U.S. Embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados (pictured) rejected ex-U.S. citizen businessman Roger Ver's application for a U.S. visa, but he states that he was later able to obtain a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Sources disagree whether the Reed Amendment had anything to do with this visa rejection. According to the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), due to the lack of regulations, the Department of State has no procedures in effect to implement the Reed Amendment. The FAM instructs consular officers that \\"[t]he role of the Department and the consular officer is very limited in implementing this ground of inadmissibility. Unless the applicant appears as a hit in the lookout system revealing a finding of inadmissibility under INA 212(a)(10)(E), you must assume the applicant is eligible.\\" Finally, the FAM states that a person who is found inadmissible due to the Reed Amendment could request a Waiver of Inadmissibility under INA 212(d)(3)(A) to obtain a non-immigrant visa, but that no waiver is available to obtain an immigrant visa. Between 2000, the first year for which the State Department's Report of the Visa Office included the relevant statistics, and 2015, no consular officer found any visa applicant ineligible for entry into the United States on the grounds of the Reed Amendment.\\"Table XX: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Visa Ineligibilities (by Grounds for Refusal Under the Immigration and Nationality Act) for Fiscal Years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015\\", Report of the Visa Office. U.S. Department of State. Retrieved 2014-06-05. The statistics on legal grounds which resulted in zero findings of ineligibility are not included in the 2003 report, while the 2014 report only includes information on immigrant visa ineligibilities and not non-immigrant visa ineligibilities under the Reed Amendment. However in the Department of State Fiscal Year 2016 report, there were two INA 212(a)(10(E) findings and one ineligibility overcome; in FY 2017, there was one ineligibility finding and one overcome. Charles M. Bruce of Moore & Bruce LLP states that some U.S. consular officers may have \\"unofficially and improperly\\" applied the Reed Amendment to refuse issuance of visas to former U.S. citizens. Mark Nestmann similarly states that he knows of occasional cases in which former citizens have been denied U.S. visas, with consuls citing the Reed Amendment as their authority. Nevertheless, Eugene Chow of Chow & King Associates states that in spite of the Reed Amendment, consular officers \\"routinely issue visas\\" to ex-U.S. citizens, and the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser has reversed denials based on the Reed Amendment after being made aware of them. ==Further unenacted legislative proposals== Since 2002, both Democratic and Republican legislators have introduced bills or amendments aiming to change the language of and clarify its scope. Academics have also written papers in legal journals suggesting changes to the Reed Amendment. None of these proposals have become law. ===Baucus–Bingaman–Burns amendment=== In June 2002, Max Baucus (D-MT), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), and Conrad Burns (R-MT) sponsored an amendment to an appropriations bill to add a provision which would rewrite as follows: :;(E) Former citizens not in compliance with expatriation revenue provisions.— :Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who relinquishes United States citizenship (within the meaning of section 877A(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and who is determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, not to be in compliance with sections 877A and 2801 of such Code (relating to expatriation). The Baucus-Bingaman-Burns amendment also included a variety of other spending offsets related to former citizens, among them new versions of the expatriation tax and the gift tax for ex-citizens ( and mentioned in the above quote), as well as changes to to allow the Internal Revenue Service to share ex-citizens' tax information with the Attorney-General in order to enforce the entry ban. to the Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002, In September 2002, Tom Harkin (D-IA) added the same language to the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2002 during the Joint Committee on Taxation markup of the bill. Q.v. the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2002, , and the Senate Finance Committee report, S.Rept. 107-283. From then until 2008 (i.e. the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses), many veterans' benefits and tax bills introduced in the Senate contained the above provisions (i.e. the enactment of and , and the amendments to and ), while the Senate Finance Committee or its members inserted these provisions into various House-originated bills as well.A partial list includes the Veterans and Military Personnel Fairness Act of 2003, ; the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 (AFTFA), ; to another version of the AFTFA, ; another version of the AFTFA, ; the Tax Relief Act of 2005, ; by Chuck Grassley to the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005; the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007, One of the attempts which saw the most support was in a Senate version of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which passed the Senate 94-3 but was never brought up for consideration in the House. to , sponsored by Max Baucus. The last attempt to introduce this provision was by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a renewable energy bill in February 2008.American Renewable Energy Act of 2008, In June 2008, the expatriation tax and gift tax provisions of the original Baucus-Bingaman-Burns amendment (i.e. and ), but not its inadmissibility or tax information privacy waiver provisions, passed into law as part of a veteran's assistance bill sponsored by Charles B. Rangel (D-NY).Heroes Earnings Assistance Relief Tax Act of 2008, , . ===SAFER Act=== Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), who originally opposed the Reed Amendment, later attempted to broaden it to cover all people who had renounced U.S. citizenship. The Securing America's Freedom Through Enforcement Reform Act, an immigration reform bill introduced by Reed Amendment opponent George Gekas (R-PA) in July 2002, and co-sponsored by 44 other Republicans including fellow Reed Amendment opponent Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), would have broadened the entry ban in to cover all renunciants regardless of whether or not they had tax avoidance motivations:Securing America's Freedom Through Enforcement Reform Act, :;(E) Former citizens who renounced citizenship.— :Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who officially renounced United States citizenship is inadmissible. The same provision was also included in bills introduced in 2003 and 2005; it did not pass either time.Securing America's Freedom Through Enforcement Reform Act of 2003, ; Securing America's Freedom Through Enforcement Reform Act of 2005, . It is not related to the SAFER Act of 2009, ; nor the SAFER Act of 2013, . ===Ex-PATRIOT Act=== In May 2012, following news that Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin had renounced his U.S. citizenship, there was speculation that the Reed Amendment might be invoked against him, and Reed himself (by then senior RI senator) sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano urging her to bar Saverin from re-entry. However, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that the Reed Amendment \\"was written in a manner that inhibits its enforcement\\", and so he and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced new legislation, the Ex-PATRIOT Act, which would make certain former U.S. citizens inadmissible to the United States and charge them 30% capital gains tax on their U.S. investments, but it died in committee. The following year, Reed himself, along with Schumer and Casey, moved the Ex-PATRIOT Act as an amendment to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, but their amendment did not appear in the final version of the bill which passed the Senate in June that year, nor in the version of the bill which was introduced in the House in October that year. ===Other=== In the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Congress amended the law concerning the expatriation tax, adding provisions to account for the possibility that a former citizen who met the asset or tax liability thresholds to trigger the tax might subsequently spend significant amounts of time in the United States. Kirsch describes this as \\"implicit recognition\\" of the \\"substantive and technical problems\\" of the Reed Amendment. Kirsch outlined an alternative proposal to more narrowly tailor the Reed Amendment in a way he suggested would make it enforceable. ==References *Reed's 2012 letter to Napolitano urging enforcement of the Reed Amendment against Eduardo Saverin Category:Acts of the 104th United States Congress Category:Visa policy of the United States ","title":"Reed Amendment (immigration)"},{"id":"35858520","text":" The Hector class was a type of 74-gun ship of the line designed for the French Navy in the 1750s.

He describes the buildings in the town as unkept and rundown: \\"Generations of neglect were written into the faces of these derelict buildings. The walls had shed their meagre mud linings, and a few of the buildings tilted to one side or another, making it as dangerous a proposition to stand in their scant shade as to live in them.\\" His opinion of the inhabitants is equally unkind, detailing how at night the marketplace was transformed into a stage where drunken peasants perpetuated blood feuds generations old. \\"Peasants didn't go to police or courts for justice.

In 1958, Chiro was one of 27 places in Ethiopia officially ranked as First Class Township. The Ethiopian News Agency reported in mid-July 1976 that negotiations held at Chiro by representatives of hostile groups of the Afars and Issas had led to a peace agreement. When Nega Mezlekia visited the town the following year, he learned that the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party and Oromo National Liberation Movement were more active around Chiro than in the rest of the province. \\"There was a strong peasant base around the town that provided a great deal of support for the party. The forest cover in the areas nearby furnished hideout.\\" However, when he returned in 1978, he found the town far more peaceful. \\"It seemed that most of the threatening political opponents of the regime were dead, in exile or rotting in prison, and the going was good for those in power.\\"Notes from the Hyena's Belly, pp. 280, 316 ==Demographics== The Oromo make up the largest ethnic group in the town.

He graduated from the Pedagogical Seminary in Gori 1882, where he associated closely with Georgian populists (Russian term narodniki). He then entered the faculty of Law of St. Petersburg University (Russia) in 1883, as a non-credit student, but returned to Georgia in 1884 due to financial constraints. Here he found employment as a teacher of the Georgian language. He also attained prominence as a famous representative of the National-Liberation movement of Georgia. Vazha-Pshavela embarked on his literary career in the mid-1880s. In his works, he portrayed the everyday life and psychology of his contemporary Pshavs. Vazha-Pshavela is the author of many world-class literary works – 36 epics, about 400 poems (\\"Aluda Ketelauri\\", \\"Bakhtrioni\\", \\"Gogotur and Apshina\\", \\"Host and Guest\\", \\"Snake eater\\", \\"Eteri\\", \\"Mindia\\", etc.), plays, and stories, as well as literary criticism, journalism and scholarly articles of ethnographic interest. Even in his fiction he evokes the life of the Georgian highlander with a near-ethnographic precision and depicts an entire world of mythological concepts. In his poetry, the poet addresses the heroic past of his people and extols the struggle against enemies both external and internal. (poems A Wounded Snow Leopard (1890), A Letter of a Pshav Soldier to His Mother (1915), etc.). In the best of his epic compositions, Vazha-Pshavela deals powerfully with the problems raised by the interaction of the individual with society, of humankind with the natural world and of human love with love of country. The conflict between an individual and a temi (community) is depicted in the epics Aluda Ketelauri (1888, Russian translation, 1939) and Guest and Host (1893, Russian translation 1935). The principal characters in both works come to question and ultimately to disregard outdated laws upheld by their respective communities,in their personal journey toward a greater humanity that transcends the merely parochial. The poet's overarching theme is that of a strong-willed people, its dignity, and its zeal for freedom. The same themes are touched upon in the play The Rejected One (1894). Vazha- Pshavela idealizes the Pshavs' time-honoured rituals, their purity, and their 'non-degeneracy' comparing and contrasting these with the values of what he considers 'false civilization'. He argues that 'Every true patriot is cosmopolitan and every genuine cosmopolitan is a patriot'. The wise man Mindia in the epic Snake-Eater (1901, Russian translation 1934) dies because he cannot reconcile his ideals with the needs of his family and those of society. The catalytic plot device of Mindia's consumption of serpent's flesh in an attempt at suicide – which results instead in his obtaining of occult knowledge, constitutes a literary employment of the central, folk tale motif present in The White Snake (Brothers Grimm) which epitomizes tale type 673 in the Aarne-Thompson classification system. The epic Bakhtrioni (1892, Russian translation 1943) tells of the part played by the tribes of the Georgian highlands in the uprising of Kakheti (East Georgia) against the Iranian oppressors in 1659. Vazha-Pshavela is also unrivalled in the field of Georgian poetry in his idiosyncratic and evocative depictions of Nature – for which he felt a deep love. His landscapes are full of motion and internal conflicts. His poetic diction is saturated with all the riches of his native tongue, and yet this is an impeccably exact literary language. Thanks to excellent translations into Russian (by Nikolay Zabolotsky, V. Derzhavin, Osip Mandelshtam, Boris Pasternak, S. Spassky, Marina Tsvetaeva, and others),into English (by Donald Rayfield, Venera Urushadze, Lela Jgerenaia, Nino Ramishvili, and others),into French (by Gaston Bouatchidzé), and into German (by Yolanda Marchev, Steffi Chotiwari-Jünger), the poet's work has found the wider audience that it undoubtedly deserves. Furthermore, Vazha-Pshavela's compositions have also become available to representatives of other nationalities of the ex-USSR. To date, his poems and narrative compositions have been published in more than 20 languages Vazha-Pshavela died in Tiflis on 10 July 1915 and was buried there, in the ancient capital city of his native land, being accorded the signal honour of a tomb in the prestigious Pantheon of the Mtatsminda Mountain, in recognition both of his literary achievements and his role as a representative of the National Liberation movement of Georgia. The mountaineer poet Vazha-Pshavela is indeed, as Donald Rayfield writes, \\"qualitatively of a greater magnitude than any other Georgian writer\\". The five epic poems of Vazha-Pshavela ('Aluda Ketelauri' (1888), 'Bakhtrioni' (1892), 'Host and Guest' (1893), 'The Avenger of the Blood' (1897) and 'Snake Eater' (1901)) are composed on the principle of the Golden ratio, and thus invite comparison with the works of Ancient and Renaissance authors similarly inspired.

There were 24 holders of the office. ==History== The Thames Gold Rush in the late 1860s and the early 1870s made Thames known as a locality, and the township developed from diggers settling in the area. The area was controlled by the Auckland Provincial Council. In late 1871, a public meeting in Grahamstown (one of the two historic towns that now forms Thames) resolved: > That in the opinion of the meeting it is desirable that a Municipal > Corporation should be established for the Thames. This resulted in the forming of a Thames Municipality Committee in early 1872. The Borough of Thames was gazetted in November 1873. The first Borough Council was elected in March 1874. As was practice at the time, the councillors voted one of themselves to be the mayor. William Davies was the only person proposed and voted into the role unanimously in April 1874. After having served as mayor for a year, James McAndrew was re-elected unopposed in 1890.

Iva frutescens is a subshrub or shrub with erect stems up to 3.5 meters (almost 12 feet) tall. The leaves are lance-shaped or somewhat oval and have toothed edges. They are variable in size, measuring from 3 to 12 centimeters (1.2-8.0 inches) or more in length. The inflorescence is an elongated array of many small flower heads with whitish florets.Iva frutescens. Flora of North America, Iva frutescens Linnaeus, 1753. Iva frutescens is very common in salt marsh habitat throughout its native range. While it is tolerant of salinity, it is not very tolerant of flooding, so it tends to grow in a narrow band along the upper margins of marshes. The band may be just a few meters wide, and individuals nearest the water may be stunted. The largest individuals have their roots in water less than 7% of the time, and the longer the roots are submerged, the smaller the plants are. However, this slight tolerance of flooding allows the plant to compete with other species on the marsh margins. This competition on one side and flooding on the other keeps the plant restricted to a narrow band. This species' position in the malophe front line of waterway erosion. It sometimes grows on substrate that has been dredged and laid out along the edges of waterways. This species provides habitat for salt marsh animals such as the marsh wren. ==References *Photo of herbarium at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Louisiana in 2008 *Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas *Go Botany, New England Wildflower Society *Delaware Wildflowers Category:Heliantheae Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Iva frutescens"},{"id":"35859017","text":"Errington is a surname found in the English-speaking world. ==Notable people with this name== *Elizabeth Errington, British archaeologist and numismatist *Sir Eric Errington, 1st Baronet (1900–1973), a British barrister and Conservative Party politician *Frank R.

It covers an area of , is long and ranges in width from . It has an average depth of . The Scotian Shelf contains the ecologically important Scotian Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) and the Scotian Shelf Waters (SSW). The northeastern boundary is defined by the Laurentian Channel, where it drops off to . Further south is the continental slope, which sharply drops off to a depth of more than . The southwestern boundary ends at the Northeast Channel, including the Gulf of Maine. The Scotian Shelf is characterized by shallow, offshore banks under the ocean surface, with deep basins and troughs between that vary in depth from . These culminate at Sable Island. A southwesterly ocean current, (occasionally containing runoff from the Gulf of St Lawrence) flows over the inner shelf. The water flow over the banks is weaker and tends have greater variation. The Scotian Shelf contains a canyon called the \\"Gully\\", which is more than deep. Currents flow through this canyon southward, mixing offshore waters with the Nova Scotia Current. This causes an increase in biological productivity toward the east, across the Continental Shelf. The Scotian Shelf is heavily influenced by the Gulf Stream, resulting in a variety of marine species being present which are normally found further south. These appear at regular intervals due to the main current spinning off cores of warm water. ==Marine life== Bathymetry near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including the Scotian Shelf. The Scotian Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) contains numerous species, including a broad range of shellfish and fishes that use the area as spawning and nursery grounds. This abundance is the reason that the Scotian Shelf is one of the Atlantic Ocean's most fished areas. The right whale has a critical habitat in the Roseway Basin, the northeastern part of the Scotian Shelf. Approximately 30 percent of the known population uses this habitat throughout the course of the year. The northern bottlenose whale also lives in the Scotian Shelf Waters area, in particular, the Gully. About 230 individual specimens have been recorded there. Other species, such as the sperm whale and harbour seal, are also found in this region, including the grey seal, which is common on Sable Island. Various waterfowl use the coastal areas as a migratory staging area. Offshore areas are used by such birds as shearwaters, sea ducks such as the common eider, and alcids such as dovekies and murres. ==References * Image *Benthic habitat mapping on the Scotian Shelf based on multibeam bathymetry, surficial geology and sea floor photographs, Marine Ecology Progress Series, Vol. 219: 121–137, September 10, 2001 *The Scotian Shelf In Context: State of the Scotian Shelf Report, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, *Eastern Scotian Shelf And Barents Sea Intercomparison: Climate Fluctuation, Human Impact and System Resilience, ICES Annual Science Conference, Nantes 20.-24.

Sharpe, 1994 and published in 1907 to wide acclaim. Thinly disguising his own views in those of Lao Can, the physician hero, Liu describes the rise of the Boxers in the countryside, the decay of the Yellow River control system, and the hypocritical incompetence of the bureaucracy. Its social satireThe Travels of Lao Can showed the limits of the old elite and officialdom and gave an in- depth look into everyday life in the countryside in the late Qing period. ==Publication history== The first 13 chapters were serialized in the bi-weekly Xiuxiang Xiaoshuo (; Illustrated Fiction) from March 1903 to January 1904, in issues 9 through 18. It was published in the Tianjin Riri Xinwen Bao (United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, p. 188.) in a 20 chapter version with a prologue.Doleželová-Velingerová, p. 724. ==Plot== In the prologue Lao Can (T: 老殘, S: 老残; literally, \\"Old Decrepit\\"), a traveling medical practitioner, dreams of China being a sinking ship. After the dream ends, Lao Can goes on a journey to fix the problems experienced by China. In the story Lao Can attempts to correct injustices, change attitudes towards women, and engage in philosophical discussions about China's future. Lao Can also acts as a detective in several small crime-related plots.Doleželová- Velingerová, p. 725. ==Style== The scholar Milena Doleželová-Velingerová writes that the integration of the detective subplots, \\"entirely dissimilar to its lyrical components,\\" \\"makes the novel so innovative.\\"Doleželová- Velingerová, p. 724-725. She remarks on the use of poetry and symbolism that \\"What sets this novel apart from the others is just this nonaction discourse, including the famous poetic descriptions of Chinese landscape, which are, however, meant to be understood not merely as images of natural beauty but as metaphorical statements about the condition of society.\\" ==Analysis== Donald Holoch argues that the entire book and not merely the prologue should be viewed as an allegory, and that if any other approach had been used, the novel would lack unity.Hegel, p. 190. In particular he believes that the novel's characters and events illustrate a \\"complex conservatism\\" that concludes that technology instead of social change is the answer to the problems experienced by China. Cordell D. K. Yee's review of The Chinese Novel at the Turn of the Century, however, argues that \\"it is doubtful that all episodes conform\\" to the allegory concept.Yee, p. 574. Robert E. Hegel, in a review argues that Holoch's interpretation is persuasive and \\"makes a substantial contribution to the studies of the novel\\". ==English translations== * This extensively annotated translation was finished in 1939, published by Cornell University Press in 1952, and issued in paperback in 1990 with a new Introduction. Timothy Wong finds that \\"more than anyone, Shaddick succeeds in capturing in English Liu E's riveting descriptions, which critics from Hu Shih and C.T.

(Ireland) and L.M., MD Berne (23 September 1859 – 1949) was one of the first women to qualify as a doctor and was a significant contributor to the modern practice of midwifery. ==Early years== Annie McCall was born in Manchester. Even as a child she knew she wanted to go into medicine, and was encouraged and supported by her mother, who provided her with an excellent education. She studied in Göttingen Germany, Paris, Berne and Vienna before entering the London School of Medicine for Women. She qualified as a doctor in 1885 as one of the first 50 women doctors and her interests included midwifery and tuberculosis. ==Founder of Clapham Maternity Hospital== Dr McCall was from the beginning deeply concerned about the high death rate of mothers during childbirth and shortly after qualifying in 1885 she started a school of midwifery in her own home at 165 Clapham Road. In 1889, with Miss Marion Ritchie, she opened the Clapham Maternity Hospital at 41 & 43 Jeffreys Road, Stockwell. This had both antenatal and postnatal clinics and set high standards of hygiene and nursing care. The hospital was the first maternity hospital staffed entirely by women doctors and only women students were admitted. A district midwifery service was also provided to deliver women in their own homes. The hospital was renamed the Annie McCall Maternity Hospital in 1936. In 1938 it was expanded when 39 Jeffreys Road was purchased, giving the hospital the capacity for fifty beds for in-patients. Unfortunately the hospital was bombed during the Second World War in 1940, causing it to be closed down. Dr McCall retired in 1941 and died in 1949 but the hospital was rebuilt after her death and the main hospital building continued as an NHS maternity hospital until 1970. The building is a grade II listed building and was converted to residential use in 2014. As a member of the Temperance movement, Dr. McCall did not allow her nurses or patients to drink alcohol. Smoking was only permitted outside the hospital. The hospital also had a Battersea branch at 31 & 33 Albert Bridge Road which opened in 1892, with a dispensary at 2 Albert Bridge Road. ==Pioneering work in midwifery and childcare== Through her pioneering work in the fields of midwifery and childcare she achieved very low death rates among her patients. The hospital was also going against the tide in taking in all women who needed attention during childbirth, including poor women, and unmarried women. Annie's attention to detail was such that each patient received a manual;‘What to do to have a Healthy Baby’. This manual contained all sorts of advice from the diet the pregnant woman should stick to prior to birth, to the kind of exercise she should be taking. Dr McCall was the vice chair of the London County Council Midwives Act Committee. ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People in health professions from Manchester Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:English women medical doctors Category:Alumni of the London School of Medicine for Women Category:20th-century English medical doctors Category:Health in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:History of the London Borough of Lambeth Category:20th-century women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians ","title":"Annie McCall"},{"id":"35859419","text":"Old Belvedere Cricket Club was a cricket club in Dublin, Ireland, that played in the Leinster Senior League.

The company was founded in 2008. Meow Wolf's attractions are located in Santa Fe and Denver, and additional attractions are slated to open in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Washington DC. Its flagship attraction, House of Eternal Return in Santa Fe, is a 20,000-square- foot facility that includes an immersive art installation, learning center, and concert venue. ==History== Meow Wolf was formed in February 2008 as an Artist Collective by \\"a group of young residents hoping to supply Santa Fe with an alternative art and music venue.\\" At the first meeting of the collective, everyone present put two scraps of paper with a word on each one in a hat, and the first two scraps drawn became the name of the collective, Meow Wolf. In 2016 Meow Wolf opened their first permanent installation, House of Eternal Return, which was built by a collective of 135 artists in Santa Fe, New Mexico. As a company, they focus on sharing abilities and processes amongst their artists to create elaborate maximalist art installations with a focus on interactivity, narrative and immersive art. ==Early projects 2008–2014== Notable Santa Fe-based installations created by Meow Wolf include \\"Biome Neuro Norb\\" (2008) a Sci-Fi inspired installation, \\"Auto Wolf\\" (2009) an installation centered around the destruction and reuse of a donated car, \\"The Moon is to Live On\\", a multimedia theatrical play, \\"Geodecadent I\\" and \\"Geodecadent II\\" (both 2010) a series of installations based on geodesic domes, \\"The Due Return\\" (2011) an installation consisting of a 70-foot long ship with two levels, and filled with rooms and objects suggesting details of implied fictional inhabitants' lives. In pursuit of teaching collaborative arts practices Meow Wolf formed CHIMERA in 2011. In 2012 CHIMERA worked with approximately one thousand Santa Fe students to create \\"Omega Mart\\", a collaborative art installation in the form of a fictitious grocery store stocked with hand-made satirical goods. \\"Omega Mart\\" was deliberately placed away from Santa Fe's arts district to attract a more diverse audience. The Omega Mart concept is currently set to be revived for the Las Vegas Meow Wolf location in 2021.https://news.yahoo.com/meow-wolf-set-transform- themed-105919686.html In 2013, CHIMERA began working with the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History's classroom mentorship program for gifted students to create an installation named \\"Project Dreamscape\\". Meow Wolf has built notable shows outside of Santa Fe. \\"Glitteropolis\\" (2011), at the New Mexico State University Art Gallery, used 50 pounds of glitter for the installation. \\"Nucleotide\\" (2013) was a drippy pastel cave-like installation built by Meow Wolf artists in Chicago at the Thomas Robertello Gallery. The majority of \\"Nucleotide\\" was conceived and built in Chicago over a 3-month period by 18 members of the collective. ==House of Eternal Return== In January 2015, author George R. R. Martin pledged $2.7 million to renovate and lease a vacant bowling alley to create a permanent facility for Meow Wolf. This was supplemented by additional funding, including $50,000 from the city of Santa Fe and $100,000 from a crowd-funding campaign. The installation, called House of Eternal Return opened March 17, 2016. It received a 2017 TEA Award and has been cited as the tenth best music venue in the United States. In 2018, TimeOut Magazine called it one of the 50 best things to do in the world right now. House of Eternal Return is focused around the story of the Selig family, who disappeared after experimenting with interdimensional travel by tapping into a mysterious force known as \\"The Anomaly\\" in an effort to bring back deceased family members, causing the house to fracture open paths to alternate dimensions. A secret government organization called the Charter was able to contain the Anomaly's effects and passes off the containment warehouse as an art installation. In January 2018, Meow Wolf announced that it will be opening two new art complexes in Las Vegas, Nevada and Denver, Colorado. On November 29, 2018, the documentary Meow Wolf: Origin Story was released in movie theaters around the United States in a one-time only showing. On January 8, 2019, rock band The Revivalists shot a music video for their song Change at House of Eternal Return. The video was released on February 19, 2019. Ninja Sex Party have filmed music videos at House of Eternal Return for their cover of Africa by Toto and We Built This City by Starship In March 2019, rapper T-Pain filmed a music video for his song A Million Times at House of Eternal Return. ==Meow Wolf's Kaleidoscape== On August 22, 2018, Meow Wolf's Kaleidoscape, an \\"other-worldly\\" dark ride based around the concept of entering a piece of contemporary art, was announced for Elitch Gardens Theme Park in Denver, Colorado, replacing Ghost Blasters. According to Meow Wolf, the attraction is intended as a prequel to their blockbuster Denver exhibit opening in 2020. ==Omega Mart== In January 2018, Meow Wolf announced that it would open its second interactive art installation in Las Vegas, Nevada as the anchor attraction at a new retail, art and entertainment complex called AREA15. Scheduled to open in early 2021, Omega Mart is a 52,000-square-foot multisensory grocery store that blends narrative storytelling, technical wizardry, and commerce. Omega Mart will prod guests into fantastical areas with overt themes tackling American consumerism and corporate responsibility – a space complete with a pharmacy, floral section, surreal products and custom- made art by Las Vegas locals. ==References * *Omega Mart Official website *New York Times T Magazine \\"The House That Art, Fantasy, and Mystery Built\\" *Santa Fe New Mexican Pasatiempo \\"Forever home: Meow Wolf opens \\"House of Eternal Return\\" \\" *Durango Herald \\"New mind-blowing Santa Fe art installation: You.

The irrigation game is a transferable utility game assigned to a cost-tree problem. A common example of this cost-tree problems are the irrigation networks. The irrigation ditch is represented by a graph, its nodes are water users, the edges are sections of the ditch. There is a cost of maintaining the ditch (each section has an own maintenance cost), and we are looking for the fair division of the costs among the users. The irrigation games are mentioned first by Aadland and Kolpin 1998, but the formal concept and the characterization of the game class is introduced by Márkus et al. 2011. == Mathematical definition == The definition of Márkus et al. 2011 is the following: A graph is a pair G =(V;A ), where the elements of V are called vertices or nodes, and A stands for the ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs or edges. A rooted tree is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path, and one vertex has been designated the root, in which case the edges have a natural orientation, away from the root. The tree-order is the partial ordering on the vertices of a rooted tree with i \\\\leq j, if the unique path from the root to j passes through i. For any e \\\\in A, e = \\\\overline{ij} means e is an edge between vertices i; j \\\\in V such that i \\\\leq j. Let c : A \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}_+. Then c and (G; c) are called cost function and cost-tree respectively: for any e \\\\in A, e = \\\\overline{ij}, c_e is the cost of joining player j to player i. Assume that the cost-tree problems have fixed, at least two, number of players (\\\\\\\\# V \\\\geq 3, \\\\\\\\# N\\\\geq 2). Let (G; c) be a cost-tree, and N be the set of the players (the vertices but the root). Consider an S\\\\subseteq N non-empty coalition, then the cost of connecting the players of S to the root is given by the cost of the minimal rooted tree which covers coalition S. By this method for each cost-tree we can define a game, called irrigation game. Formally: Definition (Irrigation game): For any cost-tree (G; c), let N=V\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{root\\\\\\\\} be the player set, and for any coalition S (the empty sum is 0) let v_{(G; c)}(S)=\\\\sum \\\\limits_{e\\\\in A_s} c(e). == Example == File:Example of irrigation game.png The above graph represents a simple irrigation game played by three players. G=(V,A) is as follows: V=\\\\\\\\{root,1,2,3\\\\\\\\}, A=\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{root1},\\\\overline{root2}, \\\\overline{23}\\\\\\\\}, and the cost function c is defined as c(\\\\overline{root1})=11,\\\\ \\\\ c(\\\\overline{root2})=5 and c(\\\\overline{23})=7. Then the irrigation game is the following: v_{(G; c)}(\\\\emptyset)=0, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\})=11, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\})=5, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\})=7, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\})=16, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{1,3\\\\\\\\})=23, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{2,3\\\\\\\\})=12, v_{(G; c)}(\\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\})=23. == Properties and Results == Márkus et al. 2011 reported several important properties of the class of the irrigation games. First, the well-known class of the airport games is a proper subset of the class of irrigation games, since the airport games are defined on special rooted trees, on chains (see: Airport problem). Second, the class of irrigation games is a non-convex cone which is a proper subset of the finite convex cone spanned by the duals of the unanimity games, therefore every irrigation game is concave. Márkus et al. 2011 also extended the Shapley and Young axiomatizations of the Shapley value to the class of irrigation games and showed that the Shapley value of an irrigation game is always in the core of the game. == References == Category:Cooperative games ","title":"Irrigation game"},{"id":"35859549","text":"Robert Eriksson (born 7 September 1971) is a former professional tennis player from Sweden.ITF Pro Circuit Profile Eriksson lost in the opening round of the 1994 US Open to Andre Agassi, who went on to win the tournament.ATP World Tour Profile ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish male tennis players ","title":"Robert Eriksson (tennis)"},{"id":"35859553","text":"Midakegn is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia.

It is a widespread plant that favours damp sunny sites. Many insect larvae have been recorded feeding on the red-fruit saw-sedge. It may grow over tall. Gahnia sieberiana was described by German botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth in 1837. It is one of the many species named in honour of the Bohemian collector, Franz Wilhelm Sieber. Gahnia sieberiana grows as a tall strappy tussock to high and wide, with rough flat leaves. The leaf margins have tiny serrations that are sharp and can cut the hands of those handling the plant. The tall black flowers grow in spikes from the centre of the plant and can rise another metre above the clump, appearing in spring and summer. They are followed by shiny red or red-brown round nuts, which measure long, in diameter. Gahnia sieberiana is found across eastern Australia, from Tasmania to North Queensland, as well as Malesia, from sea level to an altitude of . It is found on clay and sandy soils. Seeds appear to germinate after bushfire. The caterpillars of the dingy grass-skipper (Toxidia peron), montane sedge-skipper (Oreisplanus perornata), silver sedge-skipper (Hesperilla crypsargyra), flame sedge-skipper (Hesperilla idothea), golden-haired sedge-skipper (Hesperilla chrysotricha), heath sand-skipper (Antipodia chaostola), sword-grass brown (Tisiphone abeona) and northern sword-grass brown (Tisiphone helena) feed on the leaves. For Australian gardens, Gahnia sieberiana has been suggested as a native replacement for pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana), which is a noxious weed there. Cultivation is hampered by difficulties in propagation by seed. Clumps can be divided to make more plants. ==ReferencesCited text=== * Category:Taxa named by Carl Sigismund Kunth siberiana Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Poales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1837 ","title":"Gahnia sieberiana"},{"id":"35859611","text":"Sayo Nole is one of the woredas in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia.

He was best known for his plays Rocket Range and Billets and Badges. Crawford wrote twenty-four plays and twenty-one skits which are known about. Some of the plays were turned into radio dramas. Crawford also wrote numerous newspaper articles in relation to political and social problems at the time which led him to be well respected in the community.Crawford 1971 Possible photo of James Crawford. Found in Fryer Library Collection UQFL301. Box 9, Folder 4 Crawford was born in Manchester, England in 1908 and arrived in Australia in 1924.Crawford 1971, 1 As a playwright, Crawford was influenced by William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. He was also greatly influenced by the Communist Party of Australia and the ideals it stood for. In an article written by Crawford about Elizabethan Theatre he wrote that \\"In the Elizabethan Theatre, Marlowe spoke with the voice of the radical intellectual. Shakespeare spoke with the voice of the people.\\" From the themes of the plays written by Crawford it is clear he has tried to emulate both Marlowe and Shakespeare.Crawford 1964, 4 Crawford was an important member of the Roving Reds Revue Company, New Theatre Club and Realist Writers Group. He also made contributions to several other groups. Crawford also spent time in the Army Services after marrying Ursula Hills in 1938. After his divorce from Ursula, Crawford married Pamela Crawford (née Seeman) in 1949. Crawford continued writing right up until his death at Greenslopes Hospital on 11 November 1973.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 ==HistoryEarly years=== James Crawford was the son of John 'Oakden' Potter, a civil engineer, and Janet Keer, who was originally from the island of Arran. He was born in Manchester, England on 6 December 1908 as John Oakden.Healy 2012 Crawford was the youngest of the family with four other brothers and sisters. Crawford's mother died when he was eleven years old, leaving his eldest sister to run the household, as Crawford's father travelled for work. Whilst attending a school in Manchester, Crawford began to develop an interest in Shakespeare which he was taught to perform instead of reading it out aloud.Crawford 1971, 1 In 1924 Crawford finished up at his grammar school with the intention of traveling.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 At the young age of 16 he found himself on a ship destined for Australia, and arrived on its shores in 1924.Healy 2012 Crawford had originally intended to travel to Canada, however, his father suggested Australia because of the warmer climate.Crawford 1971, 2 Crawford described his younger self as a \\"starry eyed idealist\\". Once in Australia, Crawford worked as a stockman on a cattle station known as 'Kamileroi'.Healy 2012 For the next five years, he worked as a station hand in the Gulf Country. Working in the Gulf Country alongside the Indigenous Australian people and seeing the brutal way in which they were treated spurred Crawford's passion for equal rights.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 His empathy for the Indigenous Australians can be seen in this quote taken from an interview, \\"the Aborigine has always been a very good, humane person\\".Crawford 1971, 4 Crawford's first brush with the law was because he gave meat (intended for white people) to Aboriginal stockmen while he worked as a butcher. He considered himself lucky as he was not thrown in gaol but given a warning by the police. He used this personal experience as inspiration for his plays.Healy 2012 With the intention of travelling around Australia, Crawford undertook menial work to make the necessary money. Although his time working and travelling around Australia was an experience, Crawford stated \\"you wouldn't get me back there\\".Crawford 1971, 4 Crawford left for New Zealand in 1929 and stayed there until 1932.Crawford 1971, 4 His intention was to travel to South America and then head back to England, but when boarding a ship that was supposedly going to Valparaíso, it landed in Australia. Australia was going through the depression which forced Crawford to join the unemployed bagman.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 ===Career, writing, associations=== During 1932, Crawford joined the Unemployed Workers Movement, which was active in protests in Cairns and participated in riots in Mackay.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 While unemployed and living at the 'Bagman's Camp' in Victoria Park, Brisbane, he gave lectures on William Shakespeare to his unemployed acquaintances.Crawford 1971, 6 Whilst based at the camp Crawford was introduced to The Communist Manifesto and after reading and agreeing with its political stand point joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1934. Jim regarded himself as a socialist and was very impressed by Engels' work which was the Origin of the Family and Private Property and the State (1984). These inspirations gave Jim knowledge about Aboriginal law and society. Crawford also studied the science of Marxism and Leninism.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 Jim Crawford helped found the Roving Reds Revue Company with fellow bagmen. The group was also known as The Proletarian Players. The Roving Reds Revue Company was described as the most sectarian group that had ever existed in Australia.Crawford 1971, 6 This group was created for two purposes; to raise money for the Unemployed Workers' Movement and also to criticise the Australian establishment in every possible way.Lowenstein 1978, 45 However, this theatrical group only lasted for a short while due to the competition with the Student Theatre.Arrow 2002, 161 Crawford originally wanted to become an actor, however, being told he was superior in playwriting he began writing for the company.Piffard 1946, 3 Yet, Crawford stated that he was chosen to become the playwright for the Roving Reds as he was known to \\"quote the second soliloquy of Hamlet\\" while drunk.Lowenstein 1978, 45 Crawford travelled on his bike around Australia to explain the reason for the Proletarian Revolution.Crawford 1971, 7 His travels gained him the nickname the 'Anarchy Bull-Bearing Bum' .Crawford 1971, 7 While travelling, he had various jobs such as working on cotton farms in Callide Valley (Queensland), cutting wood for bakers' ovens in New South Wales, milking cows and packing tomatoes. In 1935, Crawford went to Melbourne where he stayed for eleven years, excluding the five years he spent in war service. He was involved in groups during his time in Melbourne such as the Left Book Club, the Victorian Communist Party, The Unity Theatre and the Worker's Voice, which was the forerunner of the Victorian Guardian.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 During pre-war period, the Worker's Voice had the largest circulation of any Communist Party paper in the Southern Hemisphere.Crawford 1971, 8 During the years he worked as a journalist, Crawford passionately helped to expose the struggles of the times. For example, he helped to expose the spy mission of the German naval submarine commander, Count von Luckner also known as the 'Yachtsman adventurer'. Luckner was a Nazi who travelled around the world spying for Adolf Hitler.Crawford 1971, 8 Due to his participation in the 'No Scrap Iron for Imperialist Japan' demonstrations in Melbourne, Crawford spent two days in the jail cell that Ned Kelly was incarcerated in just before he was hung. Alan Marshall and Crawford interviewed Hewlett Johnson, The Red Dean of Canterbury, together for the Worker's Voice. The Red Dean, also known as Dr Hewlett Johnson, was the dean of Canterbury in 1931 and has been described as \\"one of the most famous men in the world\\".London Review of Books 2011, 1 Marshall noted Crawford as being an outstanding journalist and one of the best at the Worker's Voice.Marshall 1983, 34 On 8 August 1939, Crawford married Ursula Mary Hill using his birth name John Oakden-Potter.Healy 2012, 1 While working at the Victorian Guardian newspaper, he wrote a weekly column under the name Jim Crawford.Healy 2012, 1 In 1940, he adopted the name 'Jim Crawford' by deed poll as he became well- known through his weekly column. In the same year, Crawford had to go underground when the Australian Government outlawed the Communist Party. Because the Victorian Guardian Newspaper wrote about Communist issues, it was also prohibited.Crawford 1971, 7 Crawford wrote illegal newspapers in Communist follower's basements.Healy 2012, 1 His friend Cecil Sharpley used to deliver the supplies. As Crawford was still involved with the illegal newspaper he was continuously on the run from the police. Towards the end of the war he discovered that Sharpley was the one who exposed his involvement with the newspaper. It was only when the Soviet Union entered the war that the ban on the Communist Party was lifted and the paper became legalised. However, due to the censorship of the war period, the paper had reduced in size.Crawford 1971, 8 On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps.Healy 2012, 1 Crawford wanted to enlist earlier but he had not been medically fit.Crawford 1971, 8 When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla.Piffard 1946, 3 While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to stop work of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates they were after, however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava.Crawford 1971, 7 In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had to shovel coal into the furnace. This coal shovelling had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema.Crawford 1971, 8 In January 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer.Healy 2012, 1 Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.Piffard 1946, 3 The separation of the war had caused damage to his relationship with his wife and he divorced Ursula, in 1946. During the latter part of 1948, Jim worked with the Queensland Guardian in Brisbane on a temporary basis. He lived in Brisbane for the rest of his life.Crawford 1971, 7 In 1948, Crawford got a serious case of pneumonia and was given up for dead. However, he managed to pull through and got married six months later to Pamela Mary Seeman on 22 December 1949. Pamela was an artist, and once married they bought several acres of rainforest on Tamborine Mountain and settled on the mountain. Possible photo of James and Pamela Crawford. Found in Fryer Library Collection UQFL301. Box 9, Folder 4. It was during this time that Crawford began writing for the theatre. Throughout his lifetime, Crawford wrote around seventeen plays.Healy 2012, 1 In addition to his plays, he wrote several short stories, such as, Pipers All and The Bottle.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974, 7 He was described as a controversial left-wing journalist with his plays being described as propagandist.Parsons 1995, 13 His first play was a one-act called Welcome Home.Healy 2012, 1 His second play was Rocket Range which explored the unfair treatment of Aboriginals in Central Australia.Parsons 1995, 13 Rocket Range was first produced in Melbourne in 1947 and afterwards the Sydney New Theatre.Obituary Jim Crawford – Playwright of the Working Class 1974 This play received awards and entered the British Drama League Festival in 1947.Healy 2012, 1 Crawford wrote several plays in support for Aboriginal Rights but Rocket Range would become the most well known and the most controversial. The play was entered into the British Drama League Festival in 1947 and although the play received a score of 75 out of a possible 100 it was thrown out for being 'ideological propaganda'. The play received 10/10 for Stage Presentation, 40/40 for Acting and 25/30 for Overall Production. However, the play received no marks under the section 'Choice of Play' and festival adjudicator Mr Harvey Adams had the following comments to make about the reasons behind the plays zero score: 'From the point of view of 'theatre' there was no reason either to write or produce this play. As Adjudicator I am not concerned with either the authors or the society's object in presenting it. It was obviously designed to 'tilt at the windmill' and it falls very short of its mark. The authors intentions appear to advocate that Australian civilisation is not only wrong but in extremely bad taste.' The Adjudicator then goes on to compare the intentions of the play to that of 'the spirit of the Chartist Riots Chartism and continued, 'Just as looms came to take their rightful place in modern advancement, so will all future inventions and developments in science, and no puny, pinchbeck efforts, having their roots bugged in the swamps of sentimental ignorance will be able to item their advance toward the betterment of mankind. I cannot but feel that this play has been chosen for presentation for not other reason than ideological propaganda and as such, I have no opinion but to throw it out of what is designed as a 'Theatrical' Festival.' Despite this, the play was well received later in 1953 in the Ipswich Play Festival.Crawford 1971, 7 In 1957, the Rocket Range was banned at a play reading held at the Municipal Library Hall (Brisbane) for being too 'political'.Healy 2012, 1 In 1947, Jim Crawford also wrote a play Refugee which addressed the issues around antisemitism. During the late 1940s Crawford wrote Uneasy Stages, Miner's Right, and Frame-Up.Healy 2012, 1 Crawford wrote another three-act play called Governor's Stables which was entered into the Theatre Council of West Australia's playwriting competition in 1951. It won the first prize which was one hundred and fifty pounds.Crawford 1971, 7 Of all the Australian male playwrights produced at the New Theatre only Jim Crawford and another playwright, Dick Diamond, author of Reedy River had their plays performed in Sydney and more than one production.Arrow 2002, 161 Jim Crawford wrote for the Junior Youth League of Queensland to perform at a Youth Carnival in Sydney.Healy 2012, 1 He wrote a one-act play called Bushland Picnic, in 1952, and afterwards, he wrote another one-act children's play called The Man-eating Clock. In March 1953, Crawford wrote a one-act play the People's Paper for the Land Guardian Festival. This play contrasted the reporting of events in Progressive newspapers and the capitalist press.Crawford 1971, 7 At the end of 1953, Crawford went to Townsville for several months to assist in reporting for the Guardian newspaper on the very successful North QLD Rank and File Worker's convention. The Playwrights Advisory Board sponsored a playwriting competition in 1955 and Crawford entered a three-act play. This play was titled The Wit to Woo and was about a hospitalised patient who had a dream of finding a hard working life.Crawford 1971, 7 Crawford wrote another play for the Ipswich Drama Festival of 1956 called They Passed this Way. It was about the old Windmill cum Observatory on Wickham Terrace, Brisbane and was performed in Brisbane by New Theatre. Jim wrote several radio features about this time, The Avenging Ghost of Campbell Town and The Celebrated Mr Barrington with various successes.Crawford 1971, 7 ===Later years and death=== In Crawford's later years he continued to write plays. For the Queensland Peace Committee, Crawford wrote A Most Important Letter!, in 1962.Healy 2012 In the same year, he wrote a three-act play called The Colour of His Money. In 1963, he wrote three plays, Shakespeare at Cedar Creek and A Little Bird Told Me for the Junior Youth League and Under the Bunya for the Wattle Dance Group. In 1969, Crawford created a play titled the Billets or Badges for the Queensland Centenary celebrations.Crawford 1971, 12 This play was about the famous Tramways Strike in Brisbane during 1912 and made quite an impact among the audience. The last full-length play that Jim Crawford wrote was The Cavern and the Tavern. Jim Crawford died on 11 November 1973 of myocardial infarction in the Greenslopes Respiration Hospital.Healy 2012 He had no children but was survived by his wife, Pamela. Crawford was known for his good humour which was aimed at the enemies of the workers.Crawford 1971, 12 ==Style and influence== Jim Crawford was a Realist writer and a part of the National Council of Groups.Healy 2012 He was associated with many other playwrights in Australia at the time, who were both Communists and playwrights. Crawford's political interests were his biggest influences and his career as a journalist gave him access to the latest political news stories and contemporary feelings on issues such as Aboriginal rights, women's rights and the rethinking of Capitalist ideas.Healy 2000, 63 Crawford's life on a cattle station was the inspiration for his short sketch/play 'The Cattle King' as well as other pieces that explored the treatment of Aboriginals. He also drew inspiration from contemporary socio-political issues such as nuclear testing at Woomera ('Rocket Range') and the 1912 Tramway Strike in Brisbane (Billets and Badges). He also took an interest in the Beatnik culture which arose in the USA and which spread to Australia in the sixties as their values reflected some of the socialist values and goals of the local Communist Party. This became the inspiration for 'The Ice Age Delinquents'. Crawford was deeply influenced by the work of William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. His articles which appeared in Queensland Guardian and The Tribune shows Crawford to have had historical and textual knowledge of the work of these two artists. Crawford endeavoured to write work that was politically and socially engaging and to write work that had a positive influence on the audience.Crawford 1964, 4 ==Plays== {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Production Detail ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes/Synopsis - Welcome Home One Act, Three Scenes The themes of this play centred on ex-service men returning home from the war and the post war housing shortage.

Written first half of 1964 and sent under the non-de-plume of \\"Wonga\\" to the competition for a one-act play sponsored by the New South Wales Gould League of Bird Lovers. The theme of the play, which had to be suitable for school children, was to emphasise the necessity of protecting Australian birds and their natural habitat. The original idea for 'A Little Bird Told Me' was first prompted in mid-1963 when a request came from the organisers of the International Children's Day for a pageant type play for children of varying age; a different form of celebration that for that years International Children's Day was adopted. Play was sent away by the playwright but nothing more was heard from them.

However, he was unhappy with idea and the format as it would not be standard time for a three-act play. It was abandoned then for the time being and when the closing date of the competition was extended to the end of May, Crawford wrote The Colour of His Money and entered it instead. The Cavern and The Tavern was rewritten in 1968 and was close to being finalised although Crawford was still unhappy about the ending of the play. He decided that Act One could in fact be a play in its own right and so took it and titled it 10,000 B.C or The Ice Age Delinquents: A Rumination in One Act. 'It is simply a mild satire on true-blue Conservatives who, throughout all recorded history, at least, have always attacked innovations, but finished up by making use of them after they had previously failed to suppress them.' (Introduction, Box 1 Folder 2) The play takes place between 10,000 BC and 6,000 BC in a cave in France (not unlike Le TroisFreres in France) and explores these themes as two young ice age rebels, Big Ears and Bentneck revolt against the constant, stereotypical dancing of the highly respectable Buffalo Fertility Dance.

Many of the performers, playwrights, musicians and production team were gathered from the unemployment camps set up in several parks around Brisbane. Crawford, otherwise known as 'Anarchy, the Ball-Bearing Bum',Wendy Lowenstein 1978, 223 was the scriptwriter for the Roving Reds, as well as one of the founding members of the group. Most of the plays' themes centred on the social and political problems associated the depression and war. The topic of Soviet Russia and their workers' state was also popular with the militant unemployed. The play, The Metro Ticket Trial was quite a popular production as the theme of the play was about the 'contemporary press attacks on all aspects of Soviet life'.Letter to Mary Murnane from Jim Crawford The main aim of The Roving Reds was to provide funding to the 'Wobble You Em' or more formally known as the Unemployed Workers' Movement.Wendy Lowenstein 1978, 223 As time went on the group's name changed to The Proletarian Players and were considered similar to the other worker's drama groups established in other states.Healy 2000, 67 Eventually The Proletarian Players disappeared as each member moved onto more pressing things. The Roving Reds also known as The Proletarian Players is seen to be the starting point for a lifelong commitment to working class theatre for Crawford. ==New Theatre Club== The New Theatre movement started in America in the late 1920s. It was motivated by the depressed economic climate which resulted in widespread unemployment, more people on welfare and evictions of those who could not pay their rent.Mona Brand 1984, 1 Most of the pieces performed where agit prop which attempted to capture social reality. When New Theatre groups were formed in Australia (beginning mainly as Worker's arts groups) they continued using agit prop in their plays. They were also committed to developing the highest possible theatrical standards as well as to introduce it to the Australian people by infusing theatre into cultural groups in all industries, organisations and districts.Spotlight National 1959, 7 Active participants in the groups were a mix of communists, members of the Labor Party and political unaligned who wanted to be actively involved in the group.Mona Brand 1984, 2 \\"Can you imagine living in the thirties, without a job, without a good square meal, without a bed to stretch out on, just drifting without a purpose? And then (imagine this too) somebody shows you that life has a purpose. That's what New Theatre offered in the late thirties.\\" Notes on the history of New Theatre, Australia 1959 This was a selling point for many who had no job, no food and no roof over their heads. To make a stand and try to reclaim what is theirs through political and socially fuelled theatre presentations. Crawford was a homeless bagman, interested in theatre and experience at writing and producing plays through his work for the Roving Reds (AKA The Proletarian Players). It was only natural that Crawford should find his home with in the New Theatre society. Crawford's first play to be performed by a New Theatre group was Welcome Home by the Melbourne branch in 1946. The views held on social and political problems by the New Theatre group aligned with Crawford's. Some the topics covered by other New Theatre writers included racial discrimination, war and peace, unemployment and other social problems. Some themes of Crawford's plays include the impact of military armament testing on Aboriginal society (Rocket Range), post war housing shortages (Welcome Home) and political commentary plays (Frame Up) just to name a few. Many plays were written to be entered into competitions on behalf of the New Theatre club.List of plays by Jim Crawford Crawford continued working with the New Theatre group for many years and wrote many plays that were performed by them. ==Involvement in political and social movements== As well as being an active playwright, Jim Crawford was very interested in social and political movements that affected the wellbeing and rights of others. Crawford was very active in his quest for equality and fairness, attending many conferences and writing articles for newspapers and magazines. Many of Crawford's stage and radio plays included themes of the battler fighting against the establishment; people trying to gain rights, as well as issues within society which he thought may need attention from a larger audience. Joe Harris, a follow Communist Party member, outlined the aim of a progressive writer in a letter of correspondence between himself and Crawford in regards to the manuscript of Billets or Badges: \\"It will be agreed that the task of progressive writers is to use art as a weapon in the working class struggle. Helping to defeat employing class ideas – helping to bring correct methods of struggle before the working class and so on\\".Joe Harris The fundamental ideology in Crawford's work is emphasised in this and hence Crawford worked in alliance with a number of groups in order to help provide the working class with equal opportunities. ===Communist Party=== With a strong belief in supporting the needs of the working class, Crawford was actively involved om the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). The party was formed in Sydney in October 1920, following the Russian Revolution. While the CPA never made a significant political challenge to the social order already established in Australia, it did however make an imprint on the trade unions, and help to establish and pioneer social movements. Crawford also contributed to the Eureka Youth League (EYL), which is an organisation associated with the CPA. According to the EYL constitution its objective was to unite all young fighters for socialism, to work and fight for a socialist Australia.Reason in Revolt 2004 Crawford also wrote the play called Refugee, which the EYL held a production for.Crawford 1947 The production was reported on in an article published on 11 November 1949.Eureka Youth League Crawford's participation in the CPA is highlighted by his invitation to the party's 40th anniversary celebration. Furthermore, the invitation reveals the ideology of the CPA where it says, \\"The Communist Party of Australia is a working class Party, having no interests separate and apart from those of the working class\\".CPA Invitation Crawford also wrote a short sketch titled \\"The Remedy\\" in 1961, which was to be performed by New Theatre Club at their rallies, as a part of their election campaign.List of plays by Jim Crawford ===Union of Australian Women=== The Union of Australian Women was first started in Sydney in August 1950 and spread to other states quite quickly. In 1956 it was decided that a national organisation would be formed uniting each state branch. Many of the founding members included those who were communists, Australian Labor Party supporters, Christian activists and Members of the New Housewives Association. The main goals of the Union of Australian Women included \\"improving the status of women and children, disarmament and a halt to nuclear testing and mining, equal distribution of wealth, increased welfare services, equal pay for Indigenous Australians, abortion law reform, and opposition to the White Australia policy.\\"The Australian Women's Register 2010 Crawford also wrote the sketch titled \\"Bus Stop Sketch\\" for the Union of Australian Women, which is a discussion between three women about unequal pay.List of plays by Jim Crawford ===Brisbane Realist Writers Group=== The Realist Writers Group was a collective of writers, usually communists but also composed of left wing supporters and established in Australia in 1944. The first collective began in Melbourne and the movement spread to Brisbane in 1950, then to Sydney in 1952, Perth in 1960 and Newcastle in 1963. In 1960 a National Council of Groups was established to internationally link the branches with groups in New Zealand, Canada, the USA and countries under communist rule. The Realist Writers intentions were defined by their constitution as 'literary organizations of the working class movement... to carry forward the revolutionary and democratic traditions of Australian literature'. The first published journal came from the Melbourne branch titled Realist Writer and appeared quarterly from March 1952 to April 1954 when it was incorporated into Overland. The first two issues were edited by Bill Wannan and by Stephen Murray-Smith for the next seven. Noteworthy contributors included David Martin, Frank Hardy, Laurence Collinson, John Manifold, John Morrison, Eric Lambert and Katharine Susannah Prichard. A version of the Realist Writer appeared from the Sydney branch in renewed form in 1958 edited by Frank Hardy and from 1960 appeared three times a year until the groups began to disintegrate in the 1970s. When the National Council of Groups was formed in 1960 the Realist Writer came under its responsibility. In 1964 the name was changed to The Realist! and from 1962-70 was edited by Ray Williams. Its contributors included Len Fox, Wilma Hedley and Ron Tullipan.William H. Wilde et al. Jim Crawford became a councillor for the National Council of Groups. On 2 February 1965 Ray Williams wrote to Crawford that after having conversations with Bill Sutton and Wilma and Lauria Hedley he had become aware of Crawford's career as a playwright and to his knowledge had already written 25 plays. Mr Williams invited Crawford to contribute to The Realist! as both a journalist and a playwright. \\"We should be most grateful if you should write an article for us – on any topic that suits you... Furthermore, I see no reason why we could not publish a portion of one of your plays, say an Act or a few scenes, at least.\\" Crawford agreed to this and went on to also write reviews for other playwrights such as Mary Gilmore as well as write as a freelance journalist.Realist Writers Group Papers Crawford was also chosen as one of the Queensland representations on the editorial board and the list was published in the Realist Writers magazine, issues 8 - March 1962.William Hatherell 2007 ===Aboriginal rights=== Crawford experienced first hand the working conditions of the Aboriginal people during the time he lived in Western Queensland, the gulf country and the Northern Territory. Lowenstein recalls an interview held with Crawford in which he describes working on cattle stations in Australia. He described to the interviewer the how the cattle industry is built upon the torment and cruelty towards millions of animals, and of the exploitation of Aboriginal labour. However without the Aboriginal labour they would not have been able to run the stations. The Government had control over the Aboriginal people and forced them to work for free as well as forcing them to remain on the stations.Lowenstein 1977, 25 After witnessing such injustice first hand, Crawford became involved in movements defending the rights of Aboriginal people. He wrote a number of articles predominantly for the Queensland Guardian regarding the rights of Indigenous Australians. His articles focused on a conference in Cairns on 1–2 December 1962, which Crawford attended. The conference was called together by the Cairns branch of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Advancement League in order to create equal working conditions for Aboriginals.Crawford 1962, 5 ==See also== * \\"James Crawford\\" The Australian Dictionary of Biography ==ReferencesBibliography== * Arrow, Michele.

Before 1600, it was the home of the McDonald's, a Scottish galloglass family who helped defend The O'Neill in Dungannon. ==Overview== The area known as Clonaneese is situated midway between Dungannon and Ballygawley in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The 1609 Bodley map shows 27 townlands there. One of these townlands, Killeeshil, gave its name to the parish which covers the most of Clonaneese. The Clonaneese name was used for the Poor Law Union and the electoral district, but is mainly associated with the two Presbyterian congregations, Lower and Upper Clonaneese. The first Presbyterians in the Clonaneese area worshipped in the Parish Church in Killeeshil. In 1617 the Rev Robert Hamilton, a Scottish Presbyterian, was installed as rector. He did not conduct the services according to the rituals of the Anglican Church and was ejected for this non-conformity in 1622. The Presbyterians built a small mud house in the townland of Innish, commonly called the \\"Clabber House\\", to meet for worship. In 1728 they applied for a Minister of their own and supplies of preaching were granted. In 1743 they rented land from the Earl of Charlemont and built a new meeting house the next year, 1744. Some years later, a mill race was dug within a few feet off the meeting house and this caused flooding. So in 1788 money was raised to raise the building, which was built in a hollow beside the Oona Water. When the money was raised the minister and a majority of the Congregation decided to build a new meeting house on higher ground. Many others objected, saying they did not want to be \\"removed from their ancient seat\\". The new meeting house was built while the others remained, both called themselves Clonaneese, but in 1809 they were in the Presbyteries of Upper and Lower Tyrone, and as geographically the upper and lower names suited they have been officially known as this since. In 2009 the Killeeshil and Clonaneese Historical Society was formed, bringing together the names by which this area is known, and the people of Killeeshil and Clonaneese. Various community events have taken place and one of the highlights was being the subject of a Lesser Spotted Ulster program on UTV. == See also == * List of townlands of County Tyrone ==References *Clonaneese official website *Killeeshil and Clonaneese Historical Society website * * Category:Geography of County Tyrone ","title":"Clonaneese"},{"id":"35859748","text":"Thomas Loebb (born 11 July 1957 in Gelsenkirchen) is a German former water polo player who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics. ==See also== * List of Olympic medalists in water polo * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo ==References * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:German male water polo players Category:Olympic water polo players of West Germany Category:Water polo players at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for West Germany Category:Olympic medalists in water polo Category:Sportspeople from Gelsenkirchen Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics ","title":"Thomas Loebb"},{"id":"35859758","text":"Werner Obschernikat (born 9 July 1955 in Duisburg) is a German former water polo player who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics, in the 1984 Summer Olympics, and in the 1988 Summer Olympics.

It was produced and written by Max Glass, an adaptation of the 1894 novel Trilby by the British writer George du Maurier. This is one of the adaptations of the novel that shifts the focus of the story more to Svengali, since at this time anti- Semitism was on the rise in Germany, and Svengali was portrayed as an evil Jew in the film. German actress Anita Dorris appeared in very few other silent films, none of which are well known today. Italian director Righelli on the other hand directed numerous films during his career, although his main claim to fame today is that he was the grandfather of Italian horror film director Sergio Martino. Svengali was remade in 1931 as a sound film starring John Barrymore. ==Plot== A pretty young artist's model named Trilby falls under the spell of a mesmerist named Svengali who turns her into a leading opera singer with no will of her own. German horror film star Paul Wegener plays Svengali, who uses hypnosis to enslave the beautiful young Trilby, preventing her marriage to her fiancée even though he cannot make her love him. The strain of controlling her and shaping her into an opera star takes a toll on both of them, and when Svengali dies suddenly, Trilby inexplicably dies with him. ==Cast== * Paul Wegener - Svengali * Anita Dorris - Trilby * André Mattoni - Billy (artist) * Teddy Bill - Leard (artist) * Hans Brausewetter - Taffy (artist) * Paul Biensfeldt - Martine (model) * Alexander Granach - Geiger Gecko * Alice Torning - Martine's wife * Hertha von Walther - Sascha (dancer) * Irma Green - Student * Hermann Picha - Landlord of cafe * Emil Heyse ==Production== Svengali had previously been filmed in 1914 as an Austrian film directed by Luise Kolm and Jacob Fleck. There were also three notable earlier silent film versions of Trilby...Trilby (1914 film), Trilby (1915 film), and again Trilby (1923 film). ==Bibliography== * Isenberg, Noah.

The devotion to Our Lady of Salvation is based on a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary that was first venerated in Joroan (now part of Tiwi, Albay) in the Philippines. The image was canonically crowned by the Catholic Church on 25 August 1976, as the heavenly patroness of the province of Albay.de Leon (1988). p I.

Fulay (1919–1935), in his booklet An Kasaysayan Kan Ladawan Ni Birhen de Salvacion. ===The Calpi tree=== According to the Fulay account, in the 1770s a certain haciendero named Don Silverio Arcilla of Buhi, assigned a tenant farmer called Mariano Dacoba, to one of his vast estates in Joroan (once known as Cagnipa), which was a satellite barrio of Buhi. While Dacoba was clearing parts of Arcilla's hacienda one day, he chopped down a big Calpi tree. Although already severed at the base, the tree's leaves did not wilt and maintained its life and freshness. The tenant informed Arcilla about it, and the latter consulted with the pastor of Buhi.de Leon (1988). pp 2-3.Nuestra Señora de Salvación and Joroan Albay Tourism Website accessed May 25, 2012Joroan was under the jurisdiction of Buhi during the Spanish colonial period A certain sculptor called Bagacumba was commissioned by the pastor of Buhi to carve an image from the Calpi trunk that Dacoba had found. Three images were carved out of the wood: that of Our Lady of Salvation, one of Our Lady of Solitude, and that of Saint Anthony of Padua.The statues of Our Lady of Salvation, Our Lady of Solitude, and St. Anthony of Padua were given to the barrios of Joroan, Buhi, and Tambo respectively On 25 August 1776, the image of Our Lady of Salvation was lent to Joroan on condition that the village's residents build a chapel at the centre of their barrio. Consequently, a certain Sotera Cababag was assigned as the chapel's Hermana Mayor, in charge of caring for the image.de Leon (1988). pp 2-3. ===The 1853 agreement=== Buhi was initially the image's rightful owner as Arcilla (who owned the land the statue's wood came from), the parish priest who had it commissioned, and the sculptor were all from the town. On 21 January 1853, Buhi and Joroan had an agreement transferring rights over the image to the latter. Buhi's parish priest and Gobernadorcillo, Rev Antonio Guadalajara and Mariano Buenaflor, respectively, made the pact with Joroan's barrio lieutenants. In accordance with the agreement, Buhi surrendered all its rights over the image if the people of Joroan made an offering of fifty pesos, and an additional twenty- five for a bell.de Leon (1988). pp 3-4. ===Miracles=== First miracle Joroan, according to Fulay, was often the target of Muslim marauders due to its proximity to the sea. During an attack, the people of Joroan would flock to the image and pray to the Virgin for protection. Tradition notes that Muslims pillaging Joroan would constantly fail to ignite houses, and this was attributed to the Virgin.de Leon (1988). pp 2-3.According to Fulay, the exact period of the phenomenon of the torch is unknown, although he suggests that it was sometime during the reign of Manuel Grivaljo as Bishop of the See of Nueva Cáceres (1748-1761) Deliverance of Hermana Tiray The second miracle was when a Hermana Mayora known only as Tiray was captured in a Moro raid. After a year of being held captive in Sulu, Tiray fell into a deep sleep and upon waking up, had realised that she was not in her quarters but was standing in an unknown forest. She then saw in a strange, white deer in the woods, which she, out of curiosity, followed through the mountains until she lost sight of it. Tiray discovered that she had already been miraculously transported to Legazpi, and was now only 38 km away from Joroan. After this incident, the people of Joroan moved the chapel further away from the sea to a higher location in the mountains, in order to avoid its desecration by raiders. Apparition The Beaches of Joroan, where Muslim raiders mounted their attacks, was also where folklore situates the apparition of Our Lady of Salvation. The third miracle was an apparition of Our Lady of Salvation. Four devotees from the island of Catanduanes went on a pilgrimage to Joroan, bringing along with them a set of beeswax candles which they intended to offer at the shrine. Upon reaching shore, three of them made a detour to Buhi to light candles for Saint Anthony, while the fourth pilgrim was left to guard their boat. As the fourth man strolled along the beach at dusk, he met a woman carrying her child. The woman asked him for a candle that she may light her way home to the mountains, as it was almost dark. The man refused since the candle was not his, but the woman was insistent and promised that she would return the candle the next morning if he would come to her house uphill. Out of generosity, the man acquiesced to the lady, who told him he can the next day enquire where she lived from the town lieutenant of Joroan, so that she can return him his candle. The next day, the man did as he was told, but the town lieutenant did not know where the mysterious lady lived. The lieutenant referred the pilgrim to the Hermana Mayor, who was also of no help, save for advising the man to seek divine guidance at the chapel of Our Lady of Salvation. Upon arriving at the chapel, the pilgrim was surprised when, at the foot of the image, lay unused and unlit exactly the same candle which he had lent the mysterious lady the day before. Upon seeing that the image resembled the mysterious woman, the man was filled with compunction. and after leaving the candle alone, prostrated and asked the Virgin to pray for his sins.de Leon (1988). pp 4-5. Final Muslim raid Iranun pirate. The fourth miracle attributed to Our Lady of Salvation occurred during the years that a Dominga de los Reyes succeeded Tiray as Hermana Mayor. While on one of their raids, the Moro pirates were said to have retreated almost immediately after seeing a vision of heavily armed men. The vision was said to have traumatised the raiders so much that it was the last Muslim attack on the shores of Joroan.de Leon (1988). p 5.It can be said that the vision was just a means of scaring the Muslim raiders; no actual army was ever recorded to have been on that occasion, hence an illusion The Boat On the eve of the feast of Our Lady of Salvation in 1884, a group from the Partido was sailing to Joroan when a whirlwind attacked the boat. Giant waves almost capsized their boat, which suddenly regained its balance. Even though they were almost dumped into the water, the passengers' clothes were completely dry as though freshly ironed. The people in the boat attributed their escape from death to Our Lady of Salvation.de Leon (1988). p 7. ===Boundary dispute=== In the late 19th century, a territorial dispute arose over whether Joroan was governed from Buhi in Ambos Camarines, or Tiwi in Albay. A Captain Vera of Albay, however, argued that Tiwi's proximity to Joroan gave it rightful jurisdiction. Vera won the case, and Joroan was annexed by Tiwi.de Leon (1988). p 6. ===Construction of a new church=== Joroan became very peaceful in the 1860s, as the boundary dispute was resolved, and the Muslims no longer attacked the barrio. During this time, Doña Clara de Vera, the wife of a certain landlord named Don Vicente de Vera,Don Vicente de Vera was known in Joroan as a wealthy landlord became the image's Hermana Mayor. Doña Clara vowed to care for the image until her death, and financed its silver and gold plating.de Leon (1988). pp 6-7. Unsatisfied with her lifetime service, De Vera initiated constriction of a new church at the centre of the Joroan. In her eagerness to construct, she sought the help of her friend, Doña Saturnina de Bayot of Tabaco, to finance the project. Another acquaintance, Don Manuel Casa of Manila, also contributed greatly, sending the needed materials and an architect. During the long trip to Joroan, the architect Casa had dispatched fell seriously ill, and men had to support him as he supervised construction. After a great deal of pain, the architect was suddenly cured on the ninth day of his work. ===Disputes with Tiwi=== The Church in Tiwi where the image was enshrined from 1895 to 1919. Traslación After the church was finished, the image was translated from the mountain chapel to the new shrine, beginning the annual custom of the image's traslación to Tiwi. The people of Tiwi were also ardent devotees of Our Lady of Salvation. Tradition gives account that whenever the fiesta in Tiwi was approaching, the parish priest would personally retrieve the image from Joroan.Traslación can be generally defined as a Spanish term for an action and effect of moving from place to someone or something The arrival of the image in Tiwi was a moment of great rejoicing, and a band would accompany its entry into the town.de Leon (1988). p 8.Transportation from Joroan to Tiwi was either by land or by sea. However, a 9km land travel was very difficult during that time due to the lack of proper roads leading to Joroan, so travel by sea was more convenient The practice was cut short by the typhoon that devastated Joroan in 1895. The chapel was completely destroyed, but the image was miraculously still standing intact on its pedestal. The people of Joroan reconstructed half of the chapel from the debris, but later on everything deteriorated. A long and bitter rift between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi began, and since the former was under the rule of the latter, Rev Francisco Borondia took the image to Tiwi until a proper chapel was built in Joroan.de Leon (1988). p 8. This meant that the direction of the traslación was reversed, and it was now the people of Joroan who borrowed the image during fiestas-- an arrangement they greatly resented. They almost lost their right to it; that is why they had spent a lot of time, effort, and money to recover it, and had to inevitably incur the ire of the people of Tiwi. Disputes with Ricardo Sayson Most Rev. John Bernard McGinley, Bishop of Nueva Cáceres and arbiter of the dispute between Tiwi and Joroan over the image. In 1917, Joroan planned to hold a grand celebration from the beginning of the novena honouring the image up to a few days after the fiesta. On the ninth day, the people of Joroan requested of Rev Ricardo Sayson, the Tiwi parish priest, that the image be allowed to stay a little longer in Joroan so that might make further homage to the Virgin. Sayson refused, and arrogantly taunted the people, daring them to file a complaint at court.de Leon (1988). pp 9-11. The people of Joroan drafted a letter to Most Rev John Bernard McGinley, Bishop of Nueva Cáceres, requesting designation of a separate pastor for Joroan. Pedro Colar I and Lino Clutario were tasked to deliver the request, and immediately set out for the see in Naga, but turned back since McGinley was visiting Albay. The emissaries overtook McGinley in Iriga, but the bishop refused to discuss the matter there, suggesting that they talk about it in Malinao on 17 November 1917. On the appointed date, Joroan again sent Clutario, this time with Miguel Diolata, and the brothers Felipe and Lorenzo Clutario.Felipe and Lorenzo Clutario are brothers. Lino Clutario was the group's spokesman, as he had the best command of English. During their audience, Clutario told Bishop McGinley that Joroan wanted a separate pastor for their barrio, and that the image of Our Lady of Salvation be ordered returned to them. The Bishop declined the first request due to a lack of priests in his diocese, but contemplated on the second with the order of the verification of the origin of the image. Another audience was set for two days later, this time with Tiwi as the venue, but nothing favourable for the people of Joroan resulted from the conference. The issue was brought to court, with Narciso Cultivo spearheading the case of the real owner of the image, and Domingo Imperial as lawyer. The civil court however deemed it an ecclesiastical matter and soon dropped it, endorsing the case to Bishop McGinley. Creation of Joroan Parish In 1918, Rev. Tomás Bernales succeeded Sayson as pastor of Tiwi. Bishop McGinley authorised him to settle the dispute with Joroan. In May of that year, Councilor Alfajara and Lieutenant Cultivo of Joroan met with Bernales, and both sides agreed that Joroan was to become a separate parish covering Sogod, Matalibong, Bariis, Maynonong, Misibis, Dapdap, and Mayong. Bishop McGinley was informed of the agreement, and named Rev. Lamberto S. Fulay as its first parish priest. The Parish of Joroan was canonically erected on 18 September 1919, with Fulay assuming duties as curé on 8 October. The image of the Lady of Salvation was still in Tiwi, so in accordance with the 1918 agreement, another Traslación was scheduled for 20 November 1919. Joroan Church had no proper paraphernalia for the time being, so Bernales lent some of his things, while donations began to pour in from all over Albay to the newly established parish.de Leon (1988). pp 12-15. The images was greeted with fireworks as its boat docked at Joroan, and there great jubilation among the townsfolk. Early the next morning, a solemn High Mass was celebrated with a huge number of pilgrims from all over the Bicolandia in attendance. Also present were the Vicar Forane; the pastors of Tiwi, Tabaco, and Nabua; the Governor of Albay; the board members of the Provincial Government; the Municipal President; the Municipal Council; and other prominent people. Episcopal Decree of 1919 Among the terms of agreement made when Joroan was raised to the status of parish was the Episcopal Decree Constandoonos of 18 September 1919. The decree states that: Although already a parish by now, Joroan still had several issues. The Decree was no guarantee that the image was now fully in Joroan's possession, so a committee was organised with the purpose of appealing to Bishop McGinley for the Decree's revision and removal of the clause “except for a span of fifteen days”. McGinley rejected the request by further stating that the Decree is part of the terms of agreement for the elevation of Joroan to the status of a parish, and that its representatives signed it.de Leon (1988) pp. 16-20 Rising tensions In 1920, Joroan was reminded to comply with the Decree. The people however, were still adamant for fear that something unfavourable might happen and majority of the people, especially the women, no longer favoured the idea of lending the image of the Lady of Salvation to Tiwi. This prompted Bishop McGinley to dispatch to Joroan Fr. Luis Dimaruba, a priest vested with ecclesiastical authority, to advise the people regarding their insolence, and to persuade them about the urgency of lending the image to Tiwi since the fiesta was approaching. However, it was only after the encouragement and assurance of the image’s return by their parish priest that led the people to reluctantly lend Tiwi the image. On 6 August 1920, a cohort with Bernales leading them, arrived in Joroan to take the image. Before the image was taken, Bernales reassured the people that the image shall be returned after fifteen days. The absence of the image in the altar of their church made the people of Joroan so anxious that they never lost track of the fifteen-day promise. However, realizing that Tiwi had not yet returned the image even though the fifteen-day agreement had already expired, the people dispatched a big boat to Tiwi so that they could remind Bernales that the agreement had already expired and also to personally get the image. The August Riot When Fulay greeted Bernales, the later was compelled to return the image. A huge number of people from Tiwi were present in the church to bid the image farewell. However, when the image was about to be handed over to Fulay, one of the onlookers screamed and seized the image from Bernales. The visitors from Joroan cried foul and rioting ensued. The message was clear: the people of Tiwi refused to give back the image by violently declaring that the image was theirs. This claim is backed by the alleged testimony of the elders of Tiwi that the image in question was just a copy of the original: the copy belonged to Tiwi, while the original was Joroan’s. Folklore held that in those days there was an antique image of Our Lady of Salvation, and that the image’s Hermana Mayor was a certain Mitay. When it was still in a good condition it used to be brought down to the chapel whenever the image was in Tiwi, but that this has already been deteriorated with age. The people of Joroan abandoned it, and that the title of Our Lady of Salvation which the present image now bears originated from this antique image. Final settlement Fulay, seeing that the brawl would do no good, advised his parishioners to go home instead. He then wrote a letter to Bishop McGinley about the heightened tensions between the peoples of Joroan and Tiwi. In response, McGinley reassured Joroan that the image will be returned to them. Owing to the previous rioting, the image was kept in the house of Vicente Vera for more than a month, and it was only on 28 September of that year that the image was returned to Joroan. To prevent future violence, Bishop McGinley on 18 August 1920 declared that: To keep the ardour of the same Marian devotion in Tiwi and to prevent further tensions, McGinley also permitted the creation of a replica for Tiwi. The original image has been permanently enshrined in Joroan since 1920. ===Later years=== Coronation On 8 December 1975, Teotimo Pacis, the Bishop of Legazpi, formally declared the Virgin Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Salvation, as the heavenly patroness of Albay. In 1976, the Diocese formally celebrated the Bicentennial Jubilee of its patroness. One of the projects during the Bicentennial was the completion of the shrine. The original design of the shrine was the handiwork of Juanito Pelea of Tiwi, but was later redesigned and finished under the supervision of Fidel Siapno of Legazpi City. After its completion, Bishop Pacis blessed the shrine on 21 August 1976. On 25 August, as a culmination to its Bicentennial year, Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, crowned Our Lady of Salvation, while the Joroan Church was proclaimed a Diocesan shrine. ==Veneration== Every year, during the month of August until September, devotees from all over the Bicol Region visit the shrine of the Lady of Salvation in Joroan. The last Saturday of August is traditionally reserved as a special day of veneration wherein pilgrims would walk in a procession for 9 km from the St. Lawrence Church of Tiwi to the Diocesan Shrine in Joroan.Barcelona (2004) Ynang Maria: A Celebration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Philippines.Pilgrimage to Joroan aboutph.com accessed May 25, 2012 In Barangay Pasadena, San Juan, Metro Manila, the image is fêted on the third weekend of May with a Mass and procession.

He is a fast bowler. He became a key member of the Trinidad and Tobago's attack quickly after his debut in 2010. Following a neck injury to Ravi Rampaul, which forced him out of the match, Gabriel made his Test match debut for West Indies in May 2012, against England at Lord's. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut on 21 June 2016 against Australia. ==Domestic career== Born 28 April 1988 in Trinidad and Tobago, Gabriel made his debut in first-class cricket on 29 January 2010 playing for Trinidad and Tobago against the Leeward Islands in the 2009–10 Regional Four Day Competition. Opening the bowling with Richard Kelly, Gabriel's first wicket was that of Mali Richards. He finished with two wickets for 46 runs in the match as Trinidad and Tobago won by 45 runs. Gabriel played two further first-class matches that season, finishing with four wickets at a cost of 39.75 runs each. In June 2010, the West Indies Cricket Board founded the West Indies High Performance Centre to improve the quality of young cricketers in the region. Gabriel was included in the centre's first intake of 15 players aged 19 to 27. The centre fielded a team in the 2010/11 WICB Cup, the regional 50-over competition. He made his List A debut in the competition on 15 October, opening the bowling and taking two wickets for 30 runs against Guyana. He played two further matches in the 2010/11 Cup without taking another wicket. In October 2018, Cricket West Indies (CWI) awarded him a red-ball contract for the 2018–19 season. ==International career== In his debut test match against England in May 2012, he took four wickets while conceding 86 runs in the match, with a good economy rate. However, during his debut Gabriel experienced pain in his back and bowled just five overs as England successfully chased 191 runs to win. He was sent home from the tour to rest the injury and Tino Best was called up in his place. On 4 March 2017 against Pakistan, Gabriel took his second Test fifer, in the fourth innings of the match. West Indies provide a margin of 186 for the visitors to win the match and seal the series. However, from the very first ball, Gabriel started to swing the ball in and out of the batsman, where batting was extremely impossible for Pakistan. Finally, Pakistan all out for 81 runs, which is their lowest total against Windies and series levelled 1-1. Gabriel took 5 for just 11 runs and he won man of the match award as well. ===Suspension=== The England cricket team toured the West Indies at the start of 2019 to play three Tests, five ODIs and three T20I matches. Gabriel was not originally named in the West Indies' ODI squad, but was added to the team after injuries to Rovman Powell and Keemo Paul. However, during the third Test in February 2019, Gabriel was heard saying a homophobic remark towards England's captain Joe Root. As a result, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Gabriel for four ODI matches. ===Return=== In April 2019, he was named in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In June 2020, Gabriel was named as one of eleven reserve players in the West Indies' Test squad, for their series against England. The Test series was originally scheduled to start in May 2020, but was moved back to July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the conclusion of two practice matches, Gabriel was added to the West Indies' Test squad. ==References * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Trinidad and Tobago cricketers Category:St Lucia Zouks cricketers Category:Barbados Tridents cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Trinbago Knight Riders cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup ","title":"Shannon Gabriel"},{"id":"35859972","text":"Summit cairn of Wool Knott, with view of Beacon Tarn Woodland Fell is an upland area in the south of the English Lake District, south of Torver, Cumbria.

They are no longer issued, having been superseded by Zimbabwean passports in 1980, with the country's reconstitution and renaming as Zimbabwe. Rhodesian passports were ostensibly valid for travel by Rhodesians anywhere in the world, but in practice they were accepted by very few countries. Following its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, Rhodesia's predominantly white minority government was unrecognised, causing the legality of its passports to become ambiguous. From 1968, United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 called on all UN member states to refuse entry to Rhodesian passport holders. The passports continued to be accepted by some non-UN countries, such as Switzerland, as well as a few UN members, including Portugal and South Africa, but they were not recognised as legal by most foreign powers. For example, when Rhodesian politicians travelled to the United States on official business during the 1970s they were issued visas on separate pieces of paper, their passports unstamped. The dispute surrounding the passports made it difficult for many Rhodesians to travel overseas, and also impacted on Rhodesia's entry into international sports competitions, such as the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cup, and the Davis Cup. Because a Rhodesian passport was of little use in practice, many Rhodesian citizens obtained documents issued by other governments, most commonly British passports, which according to a 1978 report from the International Committee of the Red Cross were held by over two-thirds of the country's white population. When the country was reorganised under black majority rule in June 1979 as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, its passports were renamed appropriately. Following the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979 and the imposition of temporary British rule, applications for Zimbabwe Rhodesian passports trebled; Zambia announced in March 1980 that it would start accepting Zimbabwe Rhodesian travellers. These passports continued to be issued for a few months following the recognised independence of Zimbabwe in 1980, stopping only when stocks were exhausted. Since then, Zimbabwean passports have been issued and used by the country's citizens. == Acceptance == Following Rhodesia's 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain, which went unrecognised by the international community, the breakaway state's passport holders faced various difficulties in overseas travel. United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 (passed in 1968) called upon all United Nations members to refuse entry to persons holding passports issued by \\"the illegal régime in Southern Rhodesia\\". However, Portugal (a UN member) as well as Switzerland and South Africa (both non-UN members at the time) accepted Rhodesian passports for travel. There were exceptions for \\"study and compassionate reasons\\" as well. The United Kingdom and the United States occasionally permitted entry to Rhodesian passport holders, particularly blacks. There were a number of instances of refusal of admission to Rhodesian passport holders over the years. The United Kingdom routinely refused admission. In one case in 1969, the Rhodesian government accused the British Home Office of detaining a Rhodesian man, Henry Ncube for three days while he transited in the United Kingdom on the way from the United States due to his refusal to apply for a British passport; Ncube was ill at the time, and reportedly did not want to apply for a British passport because he feared it could bring him trouble with Rhodesian authorities upon his return to the country. Though it was initially speculated that Australia might adopt an unofficial policy of leniency towards Rhodesian passport holders, in fact Australia also routinely refused admission to Rhodesian passport holders. However, some Rhodesians were able to proceed to Australia as migrants, for example 170 such persons in 1977. === Impact === The Rhodesian Olympic team was barred from participating in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. The refusals applied equally to black and white holders of Rhodesian passports. In September 1969, South Korea refused admission to the mostly black Rhodesian national football team, which had been billed to contest a FIFA World Cup qualifying tournament there for nearly a year. The Korean government refused to budge on this, but FIFA was adamant that Rhodesia should play; a compromise was eventually worked out whereby the winner of the series would play Rhodesia in a \\"neutral\\" country that would admit the Rhodesians. The winning team from the Korean series, Australia, ultimately took on and defeated Rhodesia in Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique over three games in November 1969. Attitudes towards Rhodesia's participation in the Davis Cup international tennis tournament were varied; having first entered in 1963, it was allowed to play up to and including 1970. Following five years of absence afterwards, it returned for two years during the late 1970s, taking part in the 1975 and 1976 competitions, but thereafter did not play again under the Rhodesian name, returning in 1981 as Zimbabwe. == Alternative documents == Rhodesian passport holders who needed to travel to other countries often ended up applying for other travel documents, including passports issued by other governments. One widely noted case involved Air Vice-Marshal Harold Hawkins, the commander of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force, who had emigrated to Rhodesia from Australia in 1946. To circumvent the logistical issues associated with his Rhodesian citizenship he successfully reapplied for an Australian passport in 1968. Many others resorted to Garry Davis' World Passport, a legally ambiguous document which few authorities recognised. In 1978, as the Rhodesian Bush War intensified, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimated that 260,000 white Rhodesians had British passports, while only 100,000 had Rhodesian passports; the ICRC was making preparations to issue laissez-passers to the latter if they needed to leave the country at the end of the war. Rhodesian officials were sometimes issued single-sheet travel letters to facilitate their entry into or exit from countries applying sanctions, for the purposes of negotiations. When Frederick Crawford went to London to discuss Rhodesia's ban from the 1968 Olympics, his British passport was seized and he departed the country on an emergency travel letter; he then declared his intention to apply for a Rhodesian passport if his British passport was not returned. Similarly, the United States Carter administration's Department of State issued visas to Prime Minister Ian Smith and his ministers on separate pieces of paper rather than stamping their Rhodesian passports, which the U.S. regarded as illegal. == Transitional passports== When Rhodesia was reconstituted under black majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979, following the Internal Settlement the previous year, the passports its government issued were altered appropriately. However, the new administration failed to gain international acceptance. With the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979, the Bush War formally ended and the country was placed under the temporary control of Britain while fresh elections were organised and held, after which recognised independence would be granted, with the country's name shortened to Zimbabwe. Passports continued to be issued during this interim period, and were first accepted by Zambia in March 1980; around this time the number of Zimbabwe Rhodesian passport applications trebled. Following the independence of Zimbabwe in April 1980, Zimbabwean passports came into use, though the old documents continued to be issued until stocks were exhausted. == Camouflage passports == More recently, a market has developed on the internet for \\"camouflage passports\\", false documents intended to mask a traveller's true nationality. These \\"passports\\" look largely genuine, but purport to be issued by country that no longer exists, or which has changed its name. The theory is that such a document could provide cover for a traveller whose genuine passport could cause him to be targeted by terrorists. Camouflage passports often claim to be Rhodesian. Though these documents hold no authenticity, Mark B. Salter writes that they are sometimes carried by members of the United States Armed Forces \\"when off duty in 'difficult' countries\\". == References == Category:Defunct passports Passport Category:Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations ","title":"Rhodesian passport"},{"id":"35860131","text":"Gustav Bauernfeind (4 September 1848, Sulz am Neckar – 24 December 1904, Jerusalem) was a German painter, illustrator and architect of partly Jewish origin.Son père, pharmacien juif autrichien installé en Bade-Wurtemberg, s'était converti au catholicisme. Cf. Adrian Darmon, Autour de l'Art Juif, Ed. Carnot, 2003, p.125 He is considered to be one of the most notable Orientalist painters of Germany. ==Life and career== After completing his architectural studies at the Polytechnic Institute in Stuttgart, he worked in the architectural firm of Professor Wilhelm Bäumer and later in that of Adolph Gnauth, where he also learned painting. In his earlier paintings, Bauernfeind focused on local views of Germany, as well as motifs from Italy. During his journey to the Levant from 1880 to 1882, he became interested in the Orient and repeated his travels again and again. In 1896 he moved with his wife and son all the way to Israel and subsequently settled in Jerusalem in 1898. He also lived and worked in Lebanon and Syria. His work is characterized primarily by architectural views of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The paintings of Bauernfeind are mostly meticulously crafted, intricately composed and almost photographically accurate cityscapes and images of known sanctuaries in oil. In addition, he produced landscape scenes and watercolours. During his lifetime he was the most popular Orientalist painter of Germany, but soon fell into oblivion after his death. However, since the early 1980s, Bauernfeind was gradually rediscovered, with his paintings appearing at auctions with high prices. Thus, his oil painting The Wailing Wall was sold at Christie's in London for the equivalent of €326,000 in 1992. The same painting would reach at Sotheby's in London the equivalent of €4.5 million in a later auction in 2007.Sefanie Stadel: Aufstieg eines Orientmalers. In: Welt am Sonntag, Nr. 27/2007, S. 74 In 1997, another oil painting of Bauernfeind, The Port of Jaffa, was sold at the Van Ham Kunstauktionen in Cologne for 1,510,000 DM, thus becoming the most expensive 19th-century painting ever sold in Germany. At his birthplace in Sulz am Neckar, the life and work of the painter is commemorated by the Gustav Bauernfeind Museum with a large permanent exhibition.

She joined the Swarovski family company in 1995, 100 years after it was founded by her great- great-grandfather Daniel Swarovski in 1895 in Wattens, Austria. She is the first female member of the executive board, and leads the global brand strategy and communications of the business, which turned over approximately €3.5 billion in 2017. She also heads up the company's Sustainability strategy and the Swarovski Waterschool community investment program, and is Chairperson of the Swarovski Foundation. == Early life and education == Nadja was born in Germany and grew up in Austria, the fifth generation of her family to be involved in the Swarovski Crystal Business. Her great-great-grandfather Daniel supplied Swarovski crystals to embellish dresses for Queen Victoria; and her grandfather Manfred Swarovski worked with Christian Dior to create the iconic 'Aurora Borealis' stones. Her father Helmut Swarovski ensured that Swarovski remained at the forefront of technological advances and new market opportunities. Having led the company's manufacturing for 45 years, he remains a member of the 'Beirat' supervisory board. She received a BA in Art History and Foreign Languages with a minor in Latin American Studies at Southern Methodist University in Texas, and studied at Sotheby's Institute of Art and the Gemological Institute of America in New York City. == Career == Nadja's career began at the Gagosian Gallery, before she went on to work for New York fashion PR Eleanor Lambert. She first worked for the Swarovski Crystal Business in Hong Kong before developing its branding and creative services functions in New York, followed by Paris, London and Singapore. Over the past 20 years, Nadja has driven a program of collaborations between the Swarovski brand and leading figures in fashion and jewelry, design and architecture, and stage and screen. Through these collaborations she has sought to position the company at the vanguard of creative and lifestyle trends and has established herself as a leading patron of creativity. In fashion, Nadja has initiated and overseen Swarovski's collaborations with more than 200 designers, including Alexander McQueen, Philip Treacy, Jason Wu, Hussein Chalayan, Erdem and Mary Katrantzou, as well as supporting emerging and established design talent through the Swarovski Collective initiative. In addition, Swarovski has supported the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Awards since 2002; and since 2016 Swarovski has partnered with the British Fashion Council as official partner sponsor of the Fashion Awards, held annually in London. In 2002, Nadja launched Swarovski Crystal Palace, a program of commissions that reimagines the traditional chandelier through collaborations with designers in the medium of Swarovski crystal. Featured designers have included Zaha Hadid, John Pawson, Tom Dixon, Ross Lovegrove, Arik Levy and Yves Behar. Nadja has also furthered the company's long relationship with the film industry through collaborations with costume and set designers. Swarovski crystals have appeared in silver screen classics since the 1930s, including Blonde Venus, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Breakfast at Tiffany’s. In recent years, Swarovski crystals have featured in movies including Moulin Rouge!, Black Swan, Skyfall and Disney's live-action Cinderella. In the music industry Nadja has overseen collaborations with costume designers for performers such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna. In 2007, Nadja set up Atelier Swarovski, a jewelry and accessories line which offers cutting-edge pieces created in collaboration with designers that highlight creativity, innovation and craftsmanship with crystal. Past collaborators include Christopher Kane, Viktor & Rolf, Jean Paul Gaultier and Karl Lagerfeld. In 2016, Atelier Swarovski launched its home décor range, partnering with designers such as Daniel Libeskind, Ron Arad, Tord Boontje, and Fredrikson Stallard. In 2017, Nadja oversaw the launch of Atelier Swarovski Fine Jewelry made with Swarovski Created Diamonds. This launch saw the brand further its commitment to ‘conscious luxury’, a concept it defines as creating beautiful products with the best available materials in a responsible way. In 2018, Nadja collaborated with two-time Oscar-nominated filmmaker Eric Valli and fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier on The Soul of Swarovski, a documentary short which captures the creative process behind a Swarovski crystal collaboration. Since 2012, Nadja has led Swarovski's Sustainability strategy and overseen Swarovski's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. Building on Daniel Swarovski's founding principles of doing business in a way that respects the wellbeing of people and the planet, she has steered the company in the direction of designing and manufacturing luxury goods that prioritize sustainable and ethical practices, while aligning Swarovski's efforts with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nadja publicly champions gender equality on international platforms and uses the company's brand visibility to promote women's empowerment. Swarovski is a signatory of the United Nations’ Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), and part of the UN Women UK National Committee Corporate Advisory Group; and, in 2018, the company supported a research program with BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) to explore and improve the lives of women in the jewelry supply chain. == Other work == Nadja set up and chairs the philanthropic Swarovski Foundation, which was established in 2013 to support charitable initiatives and organizations working in three areas: culture and creativity, promoting human empowerment and conserving natural resources. Key Swarovski Foundation partners include Barefoot College, Nest, and The Nature Conservancy, while major projects include the creation of the Swarovski Foundation Centre for Learning at the Design Museum in London. Nadja leads the efforts of Swarovski Waterschool, the company's flagship community investment program, which educates students in seven countries across the globe about safe and sustainable water use. In 2018, Swarovski collaborated with the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television to create WATERSCHOOL, a feature-length documentary which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was released globally on Netflix.

He is most recognised as the man responsible for various iconic images of Björk, The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, David Lynch, Arctic Monkeys, R.E.M. and U2. == Early life == He was born in Sønderborg, Denmark. He completed a B.A. in Nordic Literature at Århus University, then later a B.A. in Photography at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) in the Czech Republic. He established a studio in Copenhagen in 1996. When he married in 2001 took the surname Starbird from his American wife. After the marriage ended, Søren reverted to his birth name Søren Solkær.http://sorensolkaer.com/news/formerly-known-as == Career == In the beginning of his artistic career, Søren teamed up with Sune Rose Wagner of The Raveonettes on various projects, with Sune at one point accompanying him as his assistant on shoots. Søren was responsible for the strong visual tone of The Raveonettes from the early stages of their career, and he also made his music video directorial debut with \\"Beat City\\" – the second single released from The Raveonettes' Whip It On (2002) album. His collaboration with the band during the 1990s and 2000s marked his entry into the Danish music scene as a photographer of musicians. Concurrent to his work with musicians, Solkær furthered his specialisation in portraits by undertaking an eight-year project. Photographers Posed comprised 45 photographers from 15 countries, including Arnold Newman, Duane Michals, Pierre et Gilles, Anton Corbijn, Jan Saudek and Jeanloup Sieff. The collection featured Solkær's portrayals of the style associated with each of his subjects and was exhibited in galleries in Chicago, Copenhagen, Cologne, Prague and Odense. Solkær was contributing photographer for Q Magazine, Rolling Stone and GQ. As a result, he toured with Franz Ferdinand in Russia, Metallica in Portugal and Oasis in Argentina. He has also moved into the world of cinema, photographing James Franco, Danny Boyle, Tim Burton, David Lynch and John Waters. In addition, he has taken pictures for EKKO, Gaffa and Soundvenue. He has been commissioned by Universal, Sony and EMI to photograph individual artists and groups, including Metallica, The White Stripes, Primal Scream, Mark Ronson, Kasabian, Tom Jones, Regina Spektor, Stereophonics, Vampire Weekend and Led Zeppelin. In addition to his work with celebrities, between 1999 and 2009, Solkær photographed thousands of practitioners of Raja yoga meditation in Rajasthan, India. In 2009 he portrayed a large delegation of spiritual leaders at the UN Cop 15 Summit in Copenhagen. At Roskilde Festival in 2009 he built a studio in a shipping container and for 6 days, took photos of festivalgoers. == Works == Solkær has released five photography books. Beat City (2006) documents his earlier work with musicians juxtaposed with cinematic city scapes from across the world whilst his followup, CLOSER (2011), is a hard-cover coffee table book containing 238 pages of portraits of musicians. In late 2011, Solkær released his third book, Souls. Souls features portraits of meditating yogis taken on the top of Mount Abu, Rajasthan, India – the result of Solkær's seven journeys to the region. The project has been exhibited in New York, Oxford, Copenhagen, Milan, Naples, Bratislava and Reykjavík. Solkær's fourth book, SURFACE, with portraits of street artists and graffiti writers, was released by Gingko Press in 2015. His fifth book, Portraits 1993-2018 was released in 2018. The CLOSER exhibition in Øksnehallen, Copenhagen was noteworthy for its scale – occupying over 24,000 square feet of exhibition space and featuring 327 images in formats up to 3x4.5 meters. The exhibition was largely praised by the Danish media and received a 'six out of six' rating from Politiken and was subsequently nominated for best Cultural Event 2009 by AOK. Notably, Solkær's images are featured in the cover art for Franz Ferdinand's 2009 album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand as well as Stereophonics' seventh studio album Keep Calm and Carry On. Solkær's works are also featured as part of the permanent collection in the Royal Danish Library and The National Portrait Collection in Frederiksborg Castle, Denmark. == Selected solo exhibitions == * 2019: BLACK SUN, Minä Perhonen Galleria, Kyoto Japan * 2018: SURFACE, Museum of Urban Contemporary Art, Munich * 2018: BLACK SUN, Sage Gallery, Los Angeles * 2018: 25 year portrait retrospective, The National Portrait Gallery, Frederiksborg Castle, Denmark * 2017: SURFACE, UTZON CENTER, Aalborg, Denmark * 2017: CLOSER, Martin Asbæk Gallery * 2016: SURFACE, Vroom&Varossieau; Gallery, Amsterdam, Holland * 2015: SURFACE, Øksnehallen, Copenhagen, Denmark * 2015: SURFACE, The Burrard Arts Center, Vancouver, Canada * 2015: SURFACE, Allouche Gallery, New York, USA * 2015: SURFACE, Art Equity, Sydney, Australia * 2015: SURFACE, Subliminal Projects, Los Angeles, USA * 2015: SURFACE, NKN Gallery, Melbourne, Australia * 2015: SURFACE, Art Equity, Sydney, Australia * 2014: Face to Face, Kistefos Museum, Norway * 2013: Face to Face, Trapholt Museum, Kolding, Denmark * 2012: CLOSER.

Galleri Radost FX, Prague, Czech Republic == Inspirations and style == Solkær's photography is characterised by finding a tension point between intimacy and edginess. His portraits are often regarded as cinematic in tone with a distinctive colour palette. He cites the inspirations for his style as ranging from filmmakers David Lynch and Wong Kar-Wai through to the works of photographer Philip-Lorca diCorcia and painter Caspar David Friedrich. == Critical reception == Michael Stipe of R.E.M. commented that \\"Søren has a great understanding of light, and a rare eye for beauty and portraiture,\\" while Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand said that \\"working with Søren, nothing feels invasive or exploitative. You trust him and you forget about his lens. It becomes invisible. It makes him the photographer he is - not just how he responds to his light meter, sets his aperture or chooses a composition, but how he can capture what makes us the humans we are.\\" Ricky Wilson of Kaiser Chiefs once jokingly remarked \\"anyone who can keep five uninterested grown men in coats from Leeds in his view-finder for more than five seconds, must be some kind of a genius.\\" ==References External links == * Category:20th- century Danish photographers Category:21st-century Danish photographers Category:Danish photographers Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Aarhus University alumni Category:People from Sønderborg Municipality ","title":"Søren Solkær"},{"id":"35860242","text":"FIVB World Championship may refer to * FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship * FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship ","title":"FIVB World Championship"},{"id":"35860261","text":"Nonhyeon can refer to several places in South Korea. == Administrative divisions == * Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. * Nonhyeon-dong, Namdong-gu, Incheon. == Railroad stations == * In Nonhyeon-dong, Seoul: ** Nonhyeon Station on the Seoul Subway Line 7. ** Sinnonhyeon Station on the Seoul Subway Line 9. * In Nonhyeon-dong, Incheon: ** Incheon Nonhyeon Station on the Suin Line.

The Unkar Group is a sequence of strata of Proterozoic age that are subdivided into five geologic formations and exposed within the Grand Canyon, Arizona, Southwestern United States. The 5-unit Unkar Group is the basal member of the 8-member Grand Canyon Supergroup. The Unkar is about thick and composed, in ascending order, of the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, Shinumo Quartzite, Dox Formation, and Cardenas Basalt. Units 4 & 5 are found mostly in the eastern region of Grand Canyon. Units 1 through 3 are found in central Grand Canyon. The Unkar Group accumulated approximately between 1250 and 1104 Ma (1,104 million years ago, 1.1 billion). In ascending order, the Unkar Group is overlain by the Nankoweap Formation, about thick; the Chuar Group, about thick; and the Sixtymile Formation, about thick. These are all of the units of the Grand Canyon Supergroup.Hendricks, JD, and GM Stevenson (2003) Grand Canyon Supergroup: Unkar Group.

The Unkar Group makes up approximately half of the thickness of the 8-unit Supergroup. In general, the strata comprising the Unkar Group dip northeast (10°–30°) toward normal faults that dip 60+° toward the southwest. This can be seen at the Palisades fault in the eastern part of the main Unkar Group outcrop area (below East Rim). Within the central Grand Canyon, Unkar strata occur in small, rotated, downfaulted blocks or slivers where they commonly are only partially exposed. Within this center part of the Grand Canyon, the Unkar Group is incomplete because pre-Tonto Group erosion has removed strata above the level of the middle part of the Dox Formation. The missing part of the Unkar Group and the remainder of the overlying Grand Canyon Supergroup are preserved in a prominent syncline and fault block that is exposed in the eastern Grand Canyon. Examples of these fault blocks can be seen at the Isis Temple prominence, \\"Cheops Pyramid,\\" and the intersection of Phantom Creek with the Bright Angel Canyon, (North Kaibab Trail). The Unkar Group also contains thick basaltic sills and a number of small, dark dikes. In the area of Desert View and west of Palisades of the Desert, the basaltic sills form very prominent, dark gray cliffs.Lucchitta, I (2001) Hiking Arizona's Geology. Mountaineers's Books. (softcover, ) Using gravity and aeromagnetic data, combined with gravity modeling, it was inferred that Proterozoic grabens, and half-grabens filled with strata of the Unkar Group – lie buried beneath Phanerozoic rocks in northern Arizona that surround the Grand Canyon. The grabens and half grabens filled with strata of the Unkar group are associated with northwest–southeast trending Mesoproterozoic fault systems that have curving, southwest-dipping traces. These fault systems were later reactivated during the Neoproterozoic, to form basins in which the following Chuar Group accumulated, and during the Cenozoic, to form geologic structures, i.e., faults, anticlines, synclines, and monoclines, that are exposed at the surface.Seeley, JM, and KG Randy (2003) Delineation of subsurface Proterozoic Unkar and Chuar Group sedimentary basins in northern Arizona using gravity and magnetics., implications for hydrocarbon source potential. American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin. 87(8): 1299–1321. Close-up Major unconformities separate the Unkar Group from the strata overlying and underlying it. First, the Unkar Group, as the bottom unit of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, lies directly upon deeply eroded granites, gneisses, pegmatites, and schists that comprise Vishnu Basement Rocks. Second, an angular unconformity, with a dip of less than 10°, separates the base of the Nankoweap Formation from the underlying Unkar Group. Finally, a well-defined angular unconformity at the base of the relatively flat-lying Tonto Group separates it from the underlying faulted and folded strata of the Unkar Group and the rest of the Grand Canyon Supergroup that are typically tilted at angles of 10°–30°.

Walcott as the \\"Unkar terrane\\" in 1894. It and his “Chuar terrane” comprised what was then named the “Grand Canyon series” of \\"Proterozoic (Algonkian)\\" age. He regarded the Cardenas Basalt, unnamed at that time, as the uppermost unit in his \\"Unkar terrane.\\" In 1910 and 1914, Levi F. Noble later divided what he called the \\"Unkar Group\\" into five subunits, which were the Hotauta Conglomerate, Bass Limestone, Hakatai Shale, Shinumo Quartzite, and Dox Sandstone. The still unnamed Cardenas Basalt is only briefly noted as exposures of it are absent in the Shinumo 15-minute quadrangle. Although a recognized part of the Unkar Group, the basalt lava flows that overlie the Dox Formation were generally ignored and simply described as \\"basalt and diabase.\\" In 1938, Charles R. Keyes applied the name \\"Cardenesan Series\\" to the basaltic volcanic rocks within the Unkar Group.Keyes, C (1938) Basement complex of the Grand Canyon: Pan American Geologist. 20: 91–116. In 1973, the current definition of the Unkar Group developed when the Nankoweap Formation, which had been earlier added to the Unkar Group was formally removed from it and the unconformity that separates the Nankoweap Formation from the Unkar Group - was recognized.The Development of Geological Studies in the Grand Canyon. Tyrona, Miscellaneous Publications no. 17. Department of Malacology, The Academy of, Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Formations of the Unkar Group== The Bass Formation not only contains gray to red-gray dolomite and sandy dolomite but also interbedded purple-brown to dark red and reddish brown sandstone (arkose), and silty sandstone, prominent interbeds of conglomerate, and subordinate interbeds of argillite and limestone. A prominent conglomerate, the Hotauta Member, fills paleovalleys cut into the underlying Vishu basement complex at its base. The Bass Formation also contains stromatolite beds and thin volcanic ash layers. The Hotauta Member is regarded to be fluvial in origin. The remainder of the Bass Formation accumulated in relatively warm shallow marine waters.Timmons, JM, KE Karlstrom, MT Heizler, SA Bowring, GE Gehrels, and LJ Crossey, (2005) Tectonic inferences from the ca. 1254–1100 Ma Unkar Group and Nankoweap Formation, Grand Canyon: Intracratonic deformation and basin formation during protracted Grenville orogenesis. Geological Society of America Bulletin. 117(11–12): 1573–95. The Hakatai Shale consists of purple, reddish-purple, reddish-orange, and pale purple or lavender mudstone, sandy siltstone, siltstone, and arkosic sandstone. The brightly colored slopes of the Hakatai Shale contrasts sharply against the grayish outcrops of the Bass Formation. The sloping exposures of the Hakatai Shale also contrast greatly with the steep cliffs formed by the overlying Shinumo Quartzite. Stromatolites occur in the transitional zone between the Hakatai Shale and Bass Formation. The Hakatai Shale accumulated in low-energy, shallow, near-shore, marine environments. In sharp contrast to argillaceous strata above and below it, the Shinumo Quartzite consists characteristically of beds that are red, brown, or purple sedimentary quartzites and lesser massive white, red, or purple sandstone; also conglomeratic sandstone. Within these cliff-forming sandstones, mudstone-rich intervals occur. Some of these sandstone beds exhibit well-developed soft- sediment deformation structures. No fossils have been found in the Shinumo Quartzite. The lower and middle parts of the Shinumo Quartzite accumulated in coastal tidal flats and the upper part of it represents the deposits of river deltas. The gradational contact between the Shinumo Quartzite and Dox Formation above indicates a shift from deposition in coastal deltas – to fluvial deposition by a large river system. Of note, the 'soft-sediment deformation' seen in this Shinumo Quartzite formation indicates significant earthquake and tectonic activity during its deposition. The Dox Formation consists of a heterogeneous mixture of light-tan to greenish brown, siliceous quartz sandstone; calcareous lithic and arkosic sandstone; dark-brown-to-green shale and mudstone; red mudstone, siltstone, and quartz sandstone; sandy argillite; micaceous mudstone; and red quartzose, silty sandstone. In ascending order, these sediments have been subdivided into the Escalante Creek, Solomon Temple, Comanche Point, and Ochoa Point Members. Stromatolites have been reported from the Comanche Point Member. The Dox Formation locally interfingers with, and is baked by, basalt lava flows of the overlying Cardenas Basalt. Within the central Grand Canyon, pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion has removed parts of the Unkar Group above the level of the middle part of the Dox Formation. The missing part of the Dox Formation and overlying Cardenas Basalt and Chuar Group can be found in a prominent syncline and fault block in the eastern Grand Canyon. The Dox Formation accumulated in a variety of marine, coastal, estuarine, and fluvial environments.Lucchitta, I, and JD Hendricks (1983) Characteristics, depositional environment and tectonic interpretations of the Proterozoic Cardenas Lavas, eastern Grand Canyon, Arizona. Geology. 11(3): 177–81. Deep reddish, (and dipping), Dox Formation overlain by Cardenas Basalt, in contact above with multi-banded, horizontal Nankoweap Formation-(Grand Canyon Supergroup), downstream from Tanner Canyon, Tanner Rapid, and Tanner Graben. The Cardenas Basalt is composed mainly of thin discontinuous beds of pahoehoe lava flows of olivine-rich basalt. The lower part of this formation consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone that form low, talus-covered slopes. The upper unit of the Cardenas Basalt consists of cliff- forming basaltic and andesitic lava flows that are interbedded with beds of breccia, sandstone, and lapillite. No fossils have been found in the Cardenas Basalt. The Cardenas Basalt was formed by the subaerial eruption of basaltic and andesitic magma in wet coastal environments such as river deltas or tidal flats. Angular unconformities of vastly differing magnitudes separate the Cardenas Basalt from the overlying Nankoweap Formation and Tonto Group. Mafic sills and dikes (basalt resp. diabase) intrude all rocks within Unkar Group members below the Cardenas Basalt. They consist of black, medium- to coarse- grained, olivine-rich basalt that contains plagioclase, olivine, clinopyroxene, magnetite-ilmenite, and biotite. Their chemical composition indicates that they share a common source with the pyroclastic deposits and lavas of the Cardenas Basalt. The isochron ages of these sills and dikes and the Cardenas Basalt lavas are basically identical. Only sills are exposed in outcrops of the Bass Formation and Hakatai Shale. These sills range in thickness from at Hance Rapids, eastern Grand Canyon, to in Hakatai Canyon in the Shinumo Creek area. Basaltic sills form very prominent, dark gray cliffs in the area below Desert View and west of Palisades of the Desert. Exposures of the Shinumo Quartzite, and Dox Formation expose several basaltic dikes. The feeder dikes to the basaltic sills are not exposed. However, the feeder dikes for the Cardenas Basalt can be traced, discontinuously, to within a few meters of their bases. ==Unconformities== The base of the Unkar Group is a major unconformity that also forms the base of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. This unconformity is a nonconformity that separates the underlying and deeply eroded crystalline basement, which consists of granites, gneisses, pegmatites, and schists of the Vishnu Basement Rocks, from stratified Proterozoic rocks of the Unkar Group. This contact is a remarkably smooth surface that has a relief of about in the Shinuino 15-minute topographic quadrangle and in both the Bright Angel and Vishnu 15-minute topographic quadrangles. In Hotauta Canyon, and at Granite Narrows, this surface is extremely smooth with a relief of only a few meters. The greatest relief on this surface can be seen opposite the mouth of Shinumo Creek where low rounded hills of Vishnu Basement Rocks rise above the general level of a relatively flat surface. The Hotauta Member of the Bass Formation fills shallow paleovalleys that are part of this nonconformity. The Vishnu Basement Rocks underlying this surface are often deeply weathered to an average depth of below it. Where it has not been removed by erosion prior to and during the deposition of the overlying Bass Formation, a residual regolith – developed by subaerial weathering of the underlying basement rocks – is present. Typically, this regolith consists of dark-reddish brown, structureless, ferrigenous sediment that is usually a few centimeters to thick. This contact is regarded to be a classic example of an ancient peneplain.Sharp, R. P. (1940) Ep-Archean and Ep-Algonkian erosion surfaces, Grand Canyon, Arizona. Geological Society of America Bulletin. 51(8): 1235–69. The contact between the Tonto Group and Unkar Group is a prominent angular unconformity, which is part of the Great Unconformity. The surface of this angular unconformity truncates dipping strata comprising the folded and faulted Unkar Group. Though this surface is typically a plane, differential erosion of the tilted strata of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the upper layer Cardenas Basalt and the middle layer Shinumo Quartzite as ancient hills, called monadnocks. These ancient hills, which are ridges formed by block faulting, are up to tall. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group either cover or drape onto most of these ancient monadnocks. However, the summits of the highest monadnocks protrude up through the base layer Tapeats Sandstone and are blanketed by overlying Bright Angel Shale as can be seen at Isis Temple. Lava Butte is a partially exhumed prehistoric monadnock associated with this unconformity that consists of Cardenas Basalt. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the marine transgression that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone (Tapeats Sea), and other members of the Tonto Group. Within the Unkar Group, the contact between the Hakatai Shale and overlying Shinumo Sandstone is a distinct disconformity. This contact is the only significant unconformity that occurs within the Unkar Group. This disconformity is sharp and locally truncates cross-bedding and channels exhibited by sandstones in the underlying Hakatai Shale. Within the Shinumo Quartzite, a basal lag composed of a layer of conglomerate, which contains basement clasts up to across, lies on the eroded surface that forms this disconformity. This basal conglomerate contains quartzite clasts that lack any known equivalents in the Grand Canyon region. As documented by the dating of detrital zircon, this disconformity is estimated to represent a period of about 75 million years. Basalt dike in bright-orange Hakatai Shale along Colorado River at Hance Rapid, river mile 76.5, Grand Canyon. ==Age== The age and exhumation history of the underlying Vishnu Basement Rocks constrain the age of the Unkar Group. Radiometric dating of these basement rocks demonstrate that these basement rocks underwent metamorphism and deformation at mid-crustal depths of about between about 1840 and 1660 Ma ago. Prior to the deposition of the Bass Formation, these rocks were uplifted to the Earth's surface from mid-crustal depths and eroded to form the surface of the nonconformity on which the Unkar Group lies. As these rocks were uplifted from mid-crustal depths, the timing of their cooling was recorded in cooling ages of feldspars and other minerals. As determined from these cooling ages, these basement rocks were uplifted from depths of between 1750 and 1660 Ma. Then, they were uplifted from a depth of to the Earth's surface between 1300 and 1250 Ma. Thus, the surface on which the Unkar Group accumulated, is about 1250 Ma old, and the Unkar Group that buried it, is younger. The maximum age of the Unkar Group is also established by uranium- lead (U-Pb) dating of zircons from an ash bed from the Bass Formation in the basal Unkar Group of 1254 Ma near river Mile 78 (List of Colorado River rapids and features). The dating of detrital zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age may be a bit too old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages. As a result, the 1254 Ma dates remain the best estimate for the age of initial deposition of the Unkar Group. Geologists have attempted to date the Cardenas Basalt for many years. On the basis of other geologic criteria, geologists have found that the dates, which range from 1,000 to 700 million years ago, obtained for the age of the Cardenas Basalt and upper age of the Unkar Group, were too young, and something was clearly perturbing the dating systematics. The current interpretation is that the deposition of the overlying Chuar Group, in a marine setting, disrupted the potassium-argon (K-Ar) radiometric system. Apparently, fluids associated with the deposition of the Chuar Group have altered the older Cardenas Basalt, partially degraded the minerals, and therefore producing a disruption in the K-Ar systematics. Using newer dating techniques and approaches not available to earlier geologists, the Cardenas Basalt and intrusive sills have been re-dated. New data acquired using newer dating techniques and approaches, indicate that the Cardenas Basalt erupted about 1,104 million years ago. This date marks the end of the deposition of the Unkar Group. These radiometric dates are corroborated by the radiometric dating of detrial micas and zircons from the Hakatai Shale, Shinumo Quartzite, and Dox Formation. Based on all of these radiometric dates, researchers have concluded that the Unkar Group was deposited between about 1254 and 1100 Ma, with a hiatus of unknown duration between the Hakatai Shale and Shinumo Quartzite. ==References External links == * Anonymous (2011a) Unkar Group of Grand Canyon Supergroup.

This spelling was also called Soewandi Spelling (in Indonesian: edjaan Soewandi) after the Indonesian Minister of Education (Raden Soewandi) at the time. This spelling replaced the earlier spelling system, the Van Ophuijsen Spelling System, which was in force from 1901. While it simplified the van Ophuijsen system somewhat (notably with the introduction of the letter \\"u\\" and the removal of diacritics), it retained other aspects of the old system, such as the Dutch-influenced digraphs \\"ch\\", \\"dj\\" and \\"tj\\". The differences between the Van Ophuijsen Spelling System and this system are: * The vowel , which in the Van Ophuijsen Spelling System was written as oe, became u, for example goeroe became guru. * The glottal stop , which was written as ' in the van Ophuijsen Spelling System, was written as k in Republican Spelling, for example tak (formerly ta'), pak (formerly pa'), maklum (formerly ma'lum) and rakyat (formerly ra'jat). * reduplicated words could be written using the numeral 2, for example ubur2, ber-main2 and ke-barat2-an. * Both the prefix 'di-' and the preposition 'di' were written without a space after the preposition or prefix. Thus, the preposition di (for example dirumah and disawah) was not differentiated from the prefix di- (for example dibeli and dimakan). Soewandi Spelling was in force from 1947 until 1972, when it was replaced by the Perfected Spelling System (also called EYD or Ejaan yang Disempurnakan) when Mashuri Saleh became Minister of Education and Culture.

It is a week long event which falls between first and second weeks of May every year. This festival is to offer prayers to the goddess Gangamma, the Gramadevata (the goddess looking after the village) of Tirupati. ==Legend== Sri Thathaya Gunta Gangamma is Grama Devatha of Tirupati town. Once upon a time when Tirupati and surrounding areas were ruled by Palegondulu, harassment on women was enormous – they use to rape and harass any woman seen. During this time, in a village \\"Avilala\\", the Goddess Gangamma was born and grew into a most beautiful women. When the Palegondulu wanted to harm Goddess Gangamma, she with her grace and power tried to kill him. Palegondulu, fearing her, hid in a remote place. To take him out of hiding, the Gangamma planned \\"Ganga Jathara\\" where the people in Tirupathi do vichitra veshadarana and curse Gangamma for a period of 7 days. On the seventh day, the Palegondulu comes out of hiding and was killed by Goddess Gangamma for the LokaKalyanam (well being of all people). ==About== Ganga Jatara, the folk festival of Tirupati, begins with the formal Chatimpu (announcement) around midnight of Tuesday. The Gangamma Jatara is held by the Theallaya Mirasi Achari family – Eepur Achari and Kasi Achari take charge of Jatara festival and make all arrangements. The Gangamma Jatara is a very famous local festival for the people of Tirupati. It is done every year in May. As the Gangamma temple was in the banks of Thathaya gunta, the temple is famously known as \\"Thathaya Gunta Gangamma Temple\\". Priests performed the initiatory rituals and tied \`Vadibalu' to the \`Viswaroopa Sthambam' in front of the temple, that set the stage for the fete. Men making the Chatimpu roam through the old town beating dappus to announce that the festival has begun and hence the residents should not leave the town till the festival is over. Priests make the traditional huge clay idol of the goddess at the temple's portico. Everyone during the festival comes and prays to the goddess to offer her pongal, sarees, turmeric and kumkum, etc. During the last day of festival, the portico will be smashed it into pieces at the auspicious moment. Devotees then clamour around to get the clay smithereens, which they consider as sacred, to be either preserved in the ‘Puja' room or consumed by mixing it in water. Though there is a ban on animal sacrifice, goats and fowls were chopped at will at a corner of the temple. This festival is being celebrated on 13, 14 and 15 May every year, in most of the areas in Chittoor district (like Chittoor, Palamaner and Tirupati etc.), Andhra Pradesh, India. ==The FestivalDay 0: Chatimpu=== The Jatara (Folk Festival) cfficially begins with Chatimpu (official announcement) during midnight of 2nd Tuesday of the month of May. Traditionally town folk stay away from streets during Chatimpu. This announcement is carried by playing musical instruments known as Dappu. ===Day 1: Bhairagi Vesham=== The day after chatimpu is Bhairagi Vesham. On this day, (Wednesday) people used to smear their body with white color paste (Namam Kommu) and wear a garland made of \\"Rella kaya\\" (fruit). They will hold neem leaves with the hand and also tie their waist with neem leaves. Devotees will walk to the temple through the city and will leave those neem leaves and Rella Kaya graland there at the temple after the darshan of the Goddess. Devotees will do such procession on each day for the rest of the festival duration. ===Day 2: Banda Vesham=== On this day devotees used to smear their body with kumkum color paste and ties a ribbon to the head. ===Day 3: Thoti Vesham=== On this day devotees used to smear their body with charcoal and wears a garland made out of neem leaves. ===Day 4: Sunnapu Gandalu=== On the sixth day of the festival, devotees smear their body with white color paste and applies dots with charcoal. And carries a pot (Veyyi kalla Dutta) on their head. ===Day 5: Dora Vesham=== On this day devotees used to smear their body with sandal paste (Chandanam) and wears a garland made out of neem leaves and lemons. ===Day 6: Mathangi Vesham=== Gangamma who killed Palegadu in Dhora Vesham, consoled Chieftain's wife in Mathangi Vesham. ===Day 7: Gangamma Jatara=== The last day of the festival is celebrated as Ganga Jatara. During this day, all Gangamma temples in Tirupati are flocked with lakhs of devotees. People used to visit temple and offer \\"pongallu\\" and/or Sarees to Gangamma. Few Devotees used to have darshan of Gangamma by wearing \\"Sapparalu\\" (A special gopuram like object made of bamboo) along with \\"Dappu Vaidyam\\" (A musical instrument). \\"Ragi Ambali\\" is served to the devotes visiting temples all over the city. After the midnight, a clay idol of Gangamma(Viswaroopam) is installed in front of the Temple. A guy will dress up like \\"Perantallu\\" and will remove the chempa (cheek) of viswaroopam which is referred to as \\"Chempa Tholagimpu\\". The clay is later distributed to the Devotees which is believed to have curing powers. By this event the entire seven-day Jatara will come to an end. ==OfferingsAnimals=== Some devotees offer the goddess goats and hens. ===Pongal=== Women prepare pongal (dish prepared with rice, mung beans and sugar) in the temple and offer to the goddess. ===Walking on knees=== Similarly, there is another practice for women to come on their knees from their home to the temple. First, they roll a coconut on the road and then walk on their knees up to the point, pick up the coconut and roll it again. These practices bear testimony to the strong faith the native residents of Tirupati have in the goddess. ===Drinks=== ‘Ragi Ambali', a drink made of ragi and rice, is offered to the goddess and is then distributed to the devotees. ==See also== *Hindu Temples in Tirupati *Tirupati *Gangamma Jatara ==References== Category:Festivals in Andhra Pradesh Category:Tirupati ","title":"Tirupati Ganga Jatara"},{"id":"35860457","text":"J.

It is bypassed by the M2 to the south and traverses the historic A2, on the route of the Roman road of Watling Street. ==Norton Ash and Lewson StreetHistory and Buildings=== In 1798, Edward Hasted records that Norton, was written in ancient records as 'Northtune'. The manor was previously owned by Odo, Earl of Kent (as the Bishop of Bayeux), at the time of the Domesday Survey. It was recorded as 'Nortone'. The parish had three churches, and three mills without tallage (land tax),and two fisheries of twelve pence. Wood for the pannage (grazing) of forty hogs. But after his trial (for fraud) in 1076. His assets were re-apportioned including Badlesmere. The parish returned to the crown who passed it to 'Hugo de Port'. Then it passed to John de Campania (of Newenham), with a rent of 30 shillings going to Rochester Castle. In 1790, it passed to John Bennett, esquire of Faversham. This central area constitutes the main settlement with the parish church. The two most populated roads of the parish are Lewson Street Road, forming with one side road a distinct, largely thatched roof hamlet with the relatively large public house, 'The Plough', and the oldest listed cottage World's End, both 16th century, and the mainly agricultural nearby Norton Road. On the latter are Norton Court, listed grade II*, dating to the 17th century remodelled by architect Sir Reginald Blomfield and Norton Court Lodge, grade II. The church lies along a straight east-west footpath from the Court leading to a large house named Provender, listed grade II* and dating to the 16th century. ===Parish Church=== The flint church of St Mary's, is Grade I listed, most parts date between the 12th–14th centuries. It is within the diocese of Canterbury, and deanery of Ospringe. It features partly restored thirteen century triple lancet windows with ogee doorway and 14th century trefoil headed lancet windows with ogee surrounds. It contains a bibliologically inspired pictorial white memorial to Rt Hon Mary Elizabeth, Lady Sondes d.1818 and one to George Finch who died in 1584. ==Buckland== Once named in ancient Latin deeds as 'Bocheland' (book land). The Manor of Buckland was also under the control of Odo, Earl of Kent. It was later granted to the family of Crevequer. It had its own church, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, which was a ruin in 1798. It had a spire, which was still standing in 1719. 250 m east along the A2 Provender Lane branches off, facing which are Buckland Cottages and opposite is the Cricket Green on the Lane's west side; along that lane lie the (Grade II listed) Old Rectory, Barbary Farmhouse (also Grade II listed) and Coronation Cottages, finally the lane passes Provender Court, Provender Farm and further cottages, turning west and rejoining Norton Road close to Lewson Street. The lane is surrounded by orchards and has an oast house, similar to Norton Road. ==Historic Stone== Stone, or Stone-next- Faversham, found close to Ospringe in the east has just a cottage, a farm and its Anglo-Saxon chapel, which is a scheduled ancient monument. Once named in ancient Latin deeds as 'Stanes'. Edward Hasted, refers to it as \\"a small obscure parish, hardly known to anyone\\". The parish is under the control of the manor of Elverton in Luddenham. Which is written in the Domesday survey as 'Ernolton', and in ancient Latin deeds as 'Eylwartone'. The chapel was called 'the chapel of our Lady of Eylwarton'. Which is within the diocese of Canterbury, and deanery of Ospringe. In 1227, the chapel appears in the 'Black Book' (Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae) of the archdeacon of Canterbury 'Stephen Langton'. English Heritage's Maison Dieu (in Ospringe), is a museum, housing archaeological finds from the chapel and from the Roman cemetery of the town of Durolevum, the westerly predecessor to Faversham. ==Sports and Amenities== There is a cricket section and football section of the sports club on Provender Lane on an \\"open space has been and will always be one to be enjoyed by the local children and older members of the parish\\". There is a village hall providing social clubs and leisure activities. From the 1930s until 1942, there was a water softening plant in the south of the parish, about midway to Painter's Forstal. It has since been converted to a private home, known as the 'Lime Works'.The Lime Works (Savills) ==Transport== The nearest motorway junction is at Faversham, and the nearest railway station is in Teynham, to the west. ==External links== *More information on the village ==References== Category:Villages in Kent Category:Civil parishes in Kent Category:Flint buildings ","title":"Norton, Buckland and Stone"},{"id":"35860564","text":"Sheikh Ahmad Al-Ajmi (Arabic: الشيخ أحمد بن علي بن محمد آل سليمان العجمي) is a Saudi quran reciter and imam.

Distributed by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, which became a sister company to Twilight studio Summit Entertainment in 2012, it wound up released only on DVD in the United States.Comicsonline.com ==Plot== One night, a young man named Ronald (Michael Hamilton) is attacked by an unseen assailant, and during the course of the attack he loses his shirt, then one of his teeth, and gains a tattoo. Finally, he's bitten on his buttocks, which causes him to begin transforming into a vampire and incessantly break wind. A year later, Bella (Heather Ann Davis) asks her boyfriend Edward Colon (Eric Callero) to transform her into a vampire, but he insists that he marry her first. Bella also has to deal with the affections of Jacob (Frank Pacheco), a member of a pack of overweight, flatulent werewolves (who oddly never transforms). One night, Edward gets a vision of Ronald breaking into Bella's room, and brings her to the Colon family home for help, but they are unsure of what to do. Jacob then takes her to meet his grandfather (Danny Trejo), who recounts the time that he faced an ancient evil that manifested itself as \\"different characters all played the exact same way\\" (a stab at Johnny Depp and his performances as Jack Sparrow, Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka and The Mad Hatter), and believes that a similar incident is about to occur. With this information and a recent spate of people going missing, the Colons are able to deduce that a rogue vampire is creating an army of newborns (or \\"noobs\\"). The army turns out to be under the control of Victoria (Kelsey Collins), who tricks Ronald into believing Edward killed Gary Coleman and killing Bella will avenge him. The noobs get Bella's scent from a pornographic magazine, and the Colons realize that they cannot protect her, especially because of Rosalie's homicidal rages toward her and Carlisle's (John Stevenson) inability to stop himself from drinking her blood. She seeks refuge with her flamboyantly homosexual father Charlie (Flip Schultz), but soon realizes that she cannot stay with him either, due to his insistence in graphically describing his sex acts and holding orgies at his house. Eventually, Edward works out a compromise with Jacob, who takes Bella to safety and uses his flatulence to mask her scent. That night, Edward meets with Bella and Jacob and the three spend the night in a tent, where Jacob has sex with Bella as an oblivious Edward talks about how he thinks he and Jacob could be friends if they put their differences aside. The following morning the noobs catch up with the trio, but the Colons and Jacob's pack also arrive, and a fight ensues. Bella distracts the noobs by eating a special cake given to her by Jacob, which causes her to experience severe flatulence and creates a smell bad enough to distract Victoria and the noobs long enough for the Colons to kill them all. Bella agrees to marry Edward, while Jacob accidentally ends up stabbing himself to death during a fight with a TMZ reporter. A year later a pregnant Bella learns a dwarf-like copy of Edward (who had been hitting on her throughout the film, despite her obvious disgust) somehow fathered the child instead. The movie then ends by parodying the trailer to Breaking Dawn – Part 1, followed by a segment ridiculing the reactions to said trailer (in the form of YouTube videos) by certain \\"Twi-Hard\\" fans of the series. ==CastReception== Breaking Wind was met with negative reviews, mostly comparing it unfavorably to a similar Twilight parody, Vampires Suck,Rotten Tomatoes which was already panned.

The Beermen were on top by 14 points, 72-58, with five minutes left in the final period. ===Game 2=== Danny Ildefonso scored 15 of his career-high 32 points in the third quarter as the Beermen outscored the Gin Kings, 25-14, to take a 68-59 lead at the end of 36 minutes of play. ===Game 3=== Ronald Magtulis' two offensive rebounds off missed shots by Vergel Meneses and Bal David with less than a minute left in the game preserve the Gin Kings in securing a two-point victory. ===Game 4=== From a close third quarter, Ginebra suddenly erupted with fastbreak plays and long-range baskets. Danny Seigle was the biggest letdown for the Beermen, shooting 2-of-24 from the floor and 0-of-17 from the outside in San Miguel's worst loss in the conference. Jayjay Helterbrand made 12 of his 14 points while Jun Limpot hit 7 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter. ===Game 5=== Danny Ildefonso hit two crucial free throws in the final 16.6 seconds in overtime. After Ildefonso's charities, rookie Mark Caguioa, who made a career-high 30 points, had a chance to push the game into second overtime but his three-pointer bounced off the rim as time expired. ===Game 6=== Danny Seigle, firing from all angles, finished the first half with 19 points. The Beermen took a 50–39 halftime lead and there was no stopping San Miguel from thereon, dominating the boards and pulling away with a flurry of baskets in the third period to open a 19-point spread. The Beermen had their largest lead of 28 points in the fourth quarter at 92–64. Danny Seigle won on his fourth Finals MVP and San Miguel captures won on his championship 16th title. { class= style=\\"text- align:center; margin:auto\\" !2001 PBA All-Filipino Cup Champions -  San Miguel Beermen 16th title } ==RostersBroadcast notes== {class= - !Game !!

A wide variety of forms of plague cross existed in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, until plague largely disappeared by the eighteenth century. ==Plague notices== At times of plague, it was common to mark the doors of victims of the disease with a large painted cross, either in red or black paint. In later times, large printed crosses were often affixed to doors. Daniel Defoe reported, at the time of the Great Plague in 1665, that the Lord Mayor of London, in his regulations, stated:Daniel Defoe, Journal of the Plague Year > \\"That every house visited [by the disease] be marked with a red cross of a > foot long in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these > usual printed words, that is to say, \\"Lord, have mercy upon us,\\" to be set > close over the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the > same house.\\" About the same time, Samuel Pepys wrote on 7 June 1665: Samuel Pepys, Diary, June 7, 1665 > \\"I did in Drury-lane see two or three houses marked with a red cross upon > the doors, and \\"Lord have mercy upon us\\" writ there - which was a sad sight > to me, being the first of that kind that to my remembrance I ever saw.\\" ==Market structures and \\"vinegar stones\\"== In some locations, stone structures were set up outside established market areas, as temporary market crosses denoting places where town and country dwellers could trade with one another while supposedly minimising the risk of contagion. For example, at Macclesfield in Cheshire in 1603 and 1646, Greenway cross was \\"used as a 'plague cross,' to which country people came to sell their provisions to the dwellers in the town.\\"Chetham Society, Remains, Historical & Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester, Volume 97, 1876 At York, stone crosses were erected during an outbreak of plague in 1604, on main roads about one mile outside the city, to denote temporary locations where trading could take place. There, each cross held a small pool of water into which money was placed and from which it could be removed in trading. Toledo Blade, June 11, 1903, Plague Cross.

It is enclosed by city walls built in the late 5th century, and repaired and reinforced in the Middle Ages and early modern periods. ==History== The castle was built by the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518), who came from Durrës (ancient Dyrrhachium). At the time, Anastasius made the city one of the most fortified cities on the Adriatic. The ancient walls were devastated in an earthquake in 1273, and had to be extensively repaired.Durrës in 1573 Currently the medieval walls stand at nearly 15 feet (4.6 meters) in height and the three entrances of some of the fortification towers are preserved in nearly one-third of the original length of the city walls. The castle was reinforced with several guard towers by the Republic of Venice and during the period of rule in Albania by the Ottoman Empire the wall was reinforced.Kalaja e Durrësit, Durrës Guide (in Albanian) On 7 April 1939, Albanian patriots fought the Italian invasion of Albania. In Durrës, a force of only 360 Albanians, mostly gendarmes and townspeople, led by Abaz Kupi, the commander of the gendarmerie in Durrës, and Mujo Ulqinaku, a marine official, tried to halt the Italian advance. Armed only with small arms and three machine guns, they succeeded in keeping the Italians at bay for several hours until a large number of light tanks disembarked from the latter's naval vessels. After that, resistance diminished and within five hours the Italian forces had captured the entire city.Albania and King Zog: independence, republic and monarchy 1908-1939 Author Owen Pearson Edition illustrated Publisher I.B.Tauris, 2004 , p. 444-445 Today the castle is coffe bar ==Gallery== 07Durres01.jpgDurrës Ancient City Wall Entrance File:Durrës city wall.jpgDurrës city wall in 2009 File:Torra Veneciane.jpgVenetian tower File:Kalaja në Qytetin e Durrësit 07.jpgLiria Square ==See also== *Durrës *History of Albania *Venetian Albania *Anastasius I (emperor) *Thopia family *Karl Thopia *Italian invasion of Albania *Mujo Ulqinaku *Tourism in Albania *List of castles in Albania *Architecture of Albania ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 5th century Category:Castles in Albania Category:Byzantine military architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Durrës Category:Tourist attractions in Durrës County Category:Roman fortifications in Macedonia Category:City walls Category:5th-century fortifications ","title":"Durrës Castle"},{"id":"35860720","text":"Nerijus is a Lithuanian masculine given name.

He is the author of about twenty books of fiction and a dozen volumes of essays in anthropology.Francesco Bachis and Antonio Maria Pusceddu, Promemoria bibliografico delle opere di Giulio Angioni, in F. Bachis, A.M. Pusceddu (eds), Cose da prendere sul serio. Le antropologie di Giulio Angioni, Il Maestrale, Nuoro: 365-383. . In his anthropological essays (especially in Fare, dire, sentire: l’identico e il diverso nelle culture, 2011), Angioni places the variety of forms of the human life in a dimension of maximum amplitude of time and space, starting from the anthropopoietic value of doing, saying, thinking and feeling as interrelated dimensions (although usually separate and hierarchical) of human 'nature', which here is understood as characterized by culture, i. e. the human ability of continuous learning. In particular Angioni criticizes two western clichés: the superiority of speech as a solely human feature, and the separateness of the aesthetic dimension from the rest of life. Best known as a writer, Angioni is considered along with Sergio Atzeni and Salvatore Mannuzzu, to have been one of the initiators of a so-called Sardinian Literary Spring, the Sardinian narrative of today in the European arena (with the work of authors such as Salvatore Niffoi, Alberto Capitta, Giorgio Todde, Michela Murgia and many others), which followed the works of individual prominent figures such as Grazia Deledda, Emilio Lussu, Giuseppe Dessì, Gavino Ledda, Salvatore Satta. The best novels of Angioni are considered to be Le fiamme di Toledo (Flames of Toledo), Assandira, Doppio cielo (Double sky), L'oro di Fraus (The gold of Fraus). His poetic works (Tempus in 2008, Oremari in 2011) in Sardinian language and Italian came later in his career. ==Literary works== *L'oro di Fraus (Editori Riuniti 1988, Il Maestrale 2000) *Il sale sulla ferita ( 1990, Il Maestrale 2010), finalist at the Premio Viareggio 1990 *Una ignota compagnia (Feltrinelli 1992, Il Maestrale 2007), finalist at the Premio Viareggio 1992 *La casa della palma (Avagliano 2002) *Millant'anni (Il Maestrale 2002, 2009) *Il mare intorno (Sellerio 2003) *Assandira (Sellerio 2004) *Alba dei giorni bui (Il Maestrale 2005, 2009), Premio Dessi 2005 *Le fiamme di Toledo (Sellerio 2006), Premio Corrado Alvaro 2006, Premio Mondello 2006 *La pelle intera (Il Maestrale 2007) *Afa (Sellerio 2008) *Gabbiani sul Carso (Sellerio 2010) *Doppio cielo (Il Maestrale 2010) * Sulla faccia della terra (2015) ==Essays== * Ethnic Groups, in Journal of the Europeanists: * Tre saggi sull'antropologia dell'età coloniale, Flaccovio 1973 * Sa Laurera: Il lavoro contadino in Sardegna, Edes 1976 e Il Maestrale 2005: * Il sapere della mano: saggi di antroplogia del lavoro, Sellerio 1986 * Pane e formaggio e altre cose di Sardegna, Zonza 2000 * Fare dire sentire.

Ruins date from various periods, most notably the 10th, 11th, 13th and 14th centuries.Ministry of Culture listing The present 13th-century castle, with its prominent keep, succeeded a castle built in the 11th century, and an earlier foundation, built from 991 to 1015. The castle is a rectilinear pentagonal plan, with five surviving towers, one of which is much larger than the rest and serves as the keep, forming the point of the pentagon, at the end of the ridge. A gate tower protected the entrance on the opposite site. Recent evidence suggests that there may have a second court or bailey extending in front of the present gate, as well as a substantial chapel inside the presumed lower court. Thanks to its position, the keep was notably connected with the scientific experiments of Pierre Gassendi (measurement of the speed of sound), Claude Chappe (experiments with optical telegraphy in 1794) and Alfred Cornu (measurement of the speed of light in 1874). Visitors today can see the keep, the well, the moat and the remains of the curtain wall. The castle is state property. It has been listed since 1840 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Compounds are screened in cellular or animal disease models to identify compounds that cause a desirable change in phenotype. Only after the compounds have been discovered are efforts made to determine the biological targets of the compounds - a process known as target deconvolution. This overall strategy is referred to as \\"classical pharmacology\\", \\"forward pharmacology\\" or \\"phenotypic drug discovery\\" (PDD). More recently it has become popular to develop a hypothesis that a certain biological target is disease modifying, and then screen for compounds that modulate the activity of this purified target. Afterwards, these compounds are tested in animals to see if they have the desired effect. This approach is known as \\"reverse pharmacology\\" or \\"target based drug discovery\\" (TDD). However recent statistical analysis reveals that a disproportionate number of first-in-class drugs with novel mechanisms of action come from phenotypic screening which has led to a resurgence of interest in this method. == Types  In vitro === The simplest phenotypic screens employ cell lines and monitor a single parameter such as cellular death or the production of a particular protein. High-content screening where changes in the expression of several proteins can be simultaneously monitored is also often used. === In vivo === In whole animal-based approaches, phenotypic screening is best exemplified where a substance is evaluated for potential therapeutic benefit across many different types of animal models representing different disease states. Phenotypic screening in animal-based systems utilize model organisms to evaluate the effects of a test agent in fully assembled biological systems. Example organisms used for high-content screening include the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mice (Mus musculus). In some instances the term phenotypic screening is used to include the serendipitous findings that occur in clinical trial settings particularly when new and unanticipated therapeutic effects of a therapeutic candidate are uncovered. Screening in model organism offers the advantage of interrogating test agents, or alterations in targets of interest, in the context of fully integrated, assembled, biological systems, providing insights that could otherwise not be obtained in cellular systems. Some have argued that cellular based systems are unable to adequately model human disease processes that involve many different cell types across many different organ systems and that this type of complexity can only be emulated in model organisms. The productivity of drug discovery by phenotypic screening in organisms, including serendipitous findings in the clinic, are consistent with this notion. Phenotypic screening in vivo can also be readily done utilizing the cell painting assay developed by Anne E. Carpenter. A variety of differentially- tuned fluorophores label major components of cell cultures, and have great efficacy when applied to High-content screening of reference chemicals' impacts on differing eukaryotic cell lines. == Use in drug repositioning == Animal based approaches to phenotypic screening are not as amenable to screening libraries containing thousands of small molecules. Therefore, these approaches have found more utility in evaluating already approved drugs or late stage drug candidates for drug repositioning. A number of companies including Melior Discovery, Phylonix, and Sosei have specialized in using phenotypic screening in animal disease models for drug positioning. Many other companies are involved in phenotypic screening research approaches, including Evotec, Dharmacon, ThermoScientific, Cellecta, and Persomics. == Collaborative research == The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has formalized collaborative efforts with various 3rd parties aimed at conducting phenotypic screening of selected small molecules. == References  Further reading == * * Category:Drug discovery ","title":"Phenotypic screening"},{"id":"35860950","text":"Max Glass (12 June 1881 – 18 July 1965) was an Austrian screenwriter, film director, and producer.

Following the Nazi takeover of power in Germany in 1933, Glass' production companies were shut down and he was forced to go into exile in France. Glass again worked as a producer, but ran into further trouble following the German invasion of France during the Second World War. In 1942 the collaborationist Vichy Government stripped him of his citizenship. Glass and Werner then went to Brazil and United States for the remainder of the conflict, only returning to France once the war was over. They finally married in 1957. ==Selected filmography Writer === * Die entfesselte Menschheit (novel; 1920 - that year the novel was adapted to the screen to a film by the same name) ===Director=== * The Man in the Iron Mask (1923) * Bob and Mary (1923) * La reine des resquilleuses (1937) * Le chemin de Damas (1952) === Screenwriter === * Humanity Unleashed (1920) * Countess Maritza (1925) * The Humble Man and the Chanteuse (1925) * If You Have an Aunt (1925) * Why Get a Divorce?

It lies east of Newby Bridge, near the south end of Windermere, northeast of Ulverston. It is sometimes known as Staveley-in- Furness. Both names distinguish it from another Staveley in Cumbria. ==History== Historically, the village lay in the county of Lancashire. When local government underwent reorganisation in 1974 it was named \\"in Cartmel\\" to distinguish it from the other Staveley in Cumbria, which is also called Staveley-in-Westmorland or Staveley-in-Kendal to ensure that they are differentiated. It gives its name to an electoral ward which elects one councillor to South Lakeland district council, and the village has a parish council. In 1831, Samuel Lewis noted that it contained 350 inhabitants, saying \\"the living is a perpetual curacy, in the archdeaconry of Richmond, and Diocese of Chester, endowed with £800 royal bounty, and in the patronage of Lord G. Cavendish.\\" John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) states the population at the time to have been 409 people living in 76 houses and covering 2,480 acres, and that the manor belonged to the Duke of Devonshire.Wilson, John Marius, Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) ==Governance== An electoral ward in the same name exists. The wards stretches south to Field Broughton and has a total population taken from the 2011 Census of 1,991. There is a parish council. ==Geography== The neighbouring parishes are Windermere to the north west, Cartmel Fell to the north and north east, Lindale and Newton-in-Cartmel to the south east, Broughton East and Lower Allithwaite to the south, and Haverthwaite to the south west. The A590 road from Kendal to Barrow-in-Furness runs across the parish; at Newby Bridge the A592 road branches off and heads north towards Bowness. ==Landmarks== View of Windermere from Fell Foot Park The parish church is the Church of St Mary, in the Windermere deanery of the Diocese of Carlisle. The church was built by 1618 and extended or restored in 1678, 1793, and 1896–97. Since 1976 the church has formed part of the United Benefice of Leven Valley, along with those of Finsthwaite and Haverthwaite. At the furthest south east shore of the lake can be found Fell Foot Park, owned by the National Trust. Also of note is Fell Foot House (demolished) and neighbouring Town Head House, and several very old farms. 4 miles away is Buck Crag, which was once the residence of Edmund Law, curate of Staveley-in- Cartmel and local teacher. Two endowed schools respectively for boys and girls were recorded in the early 1870s. To the east is Simpson Ground Reservoir. There are 23 listed buildings and structures in the parish; the bridge over the River Leven at Newby Bridge, which was repaired in the 17th century, is grade II* listed, and the others grade II. Enter parish name to search Alfred Wainwright identifies the upland to the north east of the village as Staveley Fell, although this name does not appear on Ordnance Survey maps.

The episode premiered on NBC on May 17, 2012. In the episode, Michael learns more about the truth of the accident. He tries to get evidence that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman) tried to kill him, and finds out that Hawkins' commanding officer Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik) was also in on this setup. The story and concept of the episode was written by Evan Katz, with teleplay by Howard Gordon and Davey Holmes. It was directed by Milan Cheylov. \\"Two Birds\\" was well received by critics, who praised its storylines. Commentators noted that the script was well written. Upon airing, \\"Two Birds\\" obtained 2.1 million viewers in the United States and a 0.7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. == Plot == The episode starts with Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) trying to convince therapists Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman) tried to kill him. The therapists claim that he is imagining the plot to cope. Later, Michael tells Rex he must stay with his Aunt Carol, as Michael is working on a case with a dangerous suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality. Michael tells his wife to stay somewhere safe, and then tells the red reality Bird to meet him in the park. He tells Bird what he found out in the green reality (where his son is alive and his wife is dead) regarding Hawkins, his accident and the encrypted file and convinces Bird to copy it from Hawkins' computer, though neither of them know Hawkins has been watching them. Hawkins meets immediately with Tricia Harper and Carl Kessel (revealed to be Bird and Hawkins' precinct chief in this reality) and Kessel says they will kill both Michael and Bird and make it look like Michael did it, given his recently unstable behavior. Captain Harper shows doubts and remorse at this idea, but agrees. Still in the red reality (where his son is dead and his wife is alive), Michael visits the hacker suggested in the green reality. He gains Hawkins' password and unlocks the file. The files tell Michael that Hawkins and Kessel had a shipping container where they had been storing the heroin. Bird tells Michael that they will meet at his house, but when Michael gets there, Hawkins has killed Bird and tries to kill Michael. Hawkins, however, only manages to injure him. Hawkins calls in that Michael killed Bird and Captain Harper tells her precinct to use deadly force to bring Michael in, much to Detective Vega's surprise. Vega tries to tell Harper that, even deranged, Michael would never kill Bird, but Harper emotionally rebuts him, saying he is showing sympathy for a killer. This leaves Vega confused and suspicious. Michael manages to escape Hawkins, but passes out from his wound and wakes up back in the green reality. He finds himself back in his car, handcuffed, but relieved to see that the green reality Bird is still alive. He gives Bird Hawkins' password (\\"tulip\\"), and the information regarding Kessel and the shipping container convinces Bird that something is wrong. He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned. Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying that if they do not find any evidence of his accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins. == Production == The story and concept of the episode was written by consulting producer Evan Katz, with teleplay by executive producer Howard Gordon and co-executive producer Davey Holmes; it was Katz's third writing credit, Gordon's fourth writing credit, and Holmes' second writing credit. It was directed by Milan Cheylov, his first directing credit for the series. In January 2012, it was announced that Kevin Weisman would appear in multiple episodes of Awake. This is Weisman's second appearance on the series as Ed Hawkins. Other guest stars included Laura Innes as Tricia Harper and Daniela Bobadilla as Emma. == Reception  Ratings === \\"Two Birds\\" was originally broadcast on in the United States on NBC between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., and obtained 2.1 million viewers in the United States, slightly down from the previous episode. It acquired a 0.7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings, meaning that it was seen by 0.9% of all 18- to 49-year- olds. === Critical response === The episode was met with praise from most critics. IGN rated it 9 of 10 as \\"amazing\\", and wrote that \\"it really ramped up the intensity\\". Alan Sepinwall from HitFix complimented parts of the episode, notably the \\"excellent work from Jason Isaacs, Steve Harris and Laura Innes in both realities\\", despite claiming that they did not particularly care for the script. TV Fanatic rated it 4.6 out of 5, and noted that \\"Awake works so much better when there’s one unifying case\\". Screenrant praised the episode, claiming that there was \\"some fantastic editing and writing that allows two conversations between three people to appear as one cohesive interchange, basically setting up the remainder of the episode\\". ScreenCrush claimed that \\"a conspiracy that saw NBC running this great show off the road, or a simple unfortunate accident.\\". The Voice of TV graded the episode a \\"A-\\", despite claiming that it is annoying that he doesn't tell his family members about his new knowledge. The TV.com official blog claimed the episode was \\"impossible to sustain\\". The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"B+\\", claiming that it was \\"completely entertaining and engrossing\\", and that \\"it's just a slight tick down from last week's \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\", which was the best episode since Awake pilot, and the most surreal since the hallucinations of \\"That's Not My Penguin.\\" == References  External links == * \\"Two Birds\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Awake (TV series) episodes ","title":"Two Birds (Awake)"},{"id":"35861242","text":"The Wellington Daily News is an American daily newspaper published in Wellington, Kansas.

The series is published by Media Factory and since December 2010 and ended on January 25, 2019 with a total of 12 volumes released. There are two manga adaptation series, both serialized in Media Factory's Monthly Comic Alive magazine. An anime adaptation by Silver Link aired in Japan from October 5 to December 21, 2012. ==Premise== After 6 years of living apart due to the death of their parents, the Himenokōji twins, Akito and Akiko, are finally reunited when Akito desires to live as a member of the family once more. Although things are fine at first, Akiko begins to express her incestuous love for her older brother, who only sees her as his little sister. Things become more complicated for her when more girls move in with the siblings. ==Characters== ; : : Akito recently transferred to Saint Liliana High School where he is placed in class 2A. His twin sister, from whom he has been separated for six years, is a student at the school. Akito has a laid- back personality and hopes to live a calm, normal life, but he will work with his full strength to achieve a goal. He started to take care of his sister when they were younger, however when their parents died, the siblings were separated. Six years later, he moved out of the Takanomiya household (the people who adopted him after he was separated from Akiko) to live on his own and was finally able to reunite with his sister, only to find out that she has a brother complex which had developed while they were separated. It is later revealed that he was actually adopted by his former parents, and therefore has no blood relationship with his sister, but he has chosen to keep this as a secret, especially from her. He loves to tease Akiko and watching others tease her. Akito is quite protective of Akiko, and people around him often comment that Akito has a serious sister complex, although he insists that he only sees her as his little sister. He has secretly made a living by writing erotic novels of brother-sister incest under the pen name \\"Kōichirō Shindo\\", which are very popular since before the siblings started living together. He uses his relationship with his sister as an inspiration for his novels, with the characters' names being very similar to their own. He was given the job of Student Council \\"Vice-Assistant of Proxy of Secretary\\" so that the girls on the Council could spend more time with him. Arashi happily claims that the position was fabricated for her underground lover; technically, he is the assistant of Akiko, the student council secretary. ; : :A Saint Liliana High School second year student. Akiko is Akito's sister, is very pretty and has polite manners. Akiko was adopted by the Arisugawa family when she and Akito were separated after their parents died. She has a very serious brother- complex, and is making every effort to seduce Akito. She is also very proud of her brother complex and makes no effort in hiding it. At the same time she denies that her brother in turn has a sister-complex. She is the secretary of Saint Liliana High School Student Council and does not like it when Akito interacts with other student council members. She doesn't know that Akito has no blood relationship with her and believes that they are twins. She is a fan of Kōichirō Shindo, and wishes that her brother would be as aggressive as the brother in Kōichirō Shindo's novel. She hasn't noticed that the beginning of his novel is based on their relationship nor does she know that Kōichirō Shindo is actually her brother. ; : :A Saint Liliana High School second year student and the Vice-President of the Student Council. She is the daughter of the owner of Nasuhara industry, a world-wide company. Anastasia is half- Russian and half-American with blonde twin tails. She has a cold personality and often asks strange questions, for example asking Akito if he was a cherry boy (a term for virgin) when they first met. She is Akiko's rival and proud that she wins a little in almost everything, including height, grades, breast size, rank during the Miss Saint Liliana High School Election, and Student Council rank. However, she is extremely bad at house chores due to her upbringing in a wealthy family, to the point that she will gladly admit it and try to escape from doing them. She also loves cute things, and not only keeps many plushies in her room, but also loves to play with Arisa. Despite being Akiko's rival, she gets along very well with Akito and confessed to him on his first day at school. Akito hasn't had a chance to answer her due to the chaotic situation that the confession brought about. She demands that Akito call her Ana, but teases him whenever he does so (because ana (穴) means hole in Japanese). ; : :Akito's childhood friend. Despite having a boyish name and way of talking, Ginbei is a girl and secretly has feelings for Akito. Due to her merchant family tradition, she was raised as a boy and not allowed to take a job herself, living only on her family's financial support. She later transferred to Saint Liliana High School (to be closer to Akito) and became the accountant of the Student Council. Despite the fact that she moved and transferred schools to follow him, Akito often refers to her as his best (normal) friend, which greatly disappoints her. She has a habit of mumbling about Akito's ignorance whenever he overlooks her feelings. ; : :A Saint Liliana High School third year student and the President of the Student Council, Arashi wears a ponytail, has heterochromia and is seen often wearing an eyepatch over her right eye. She is also often seen carrying a real katana. She has the best grades among the 3rd year students and is a powerful leader, being able not only to handle most of the Student Council chores by herself, but also to take control of most of the school's activities. She is bisexual and very sexually aggressive, claiming she has had over 30 lovers, thus gaining the nickname \\"The Predator\\". However, later in the story she decides to peacefully break up with her lovers in order to make the Student Council into her harem. She also has the habit of referring to Akito as either her underground lover or sex slave. She is actually Akito's cousin from before his adoption by Akiko's parents, and is aware that Akito was adopted by her family. She is also the only one on the Student Council who knows that Akito is Kōichirō Shindo. ; : :The daughter of Akito's second adoptive family and also his fiancée. Arisa/Alisa is a genius; despite being only 12 years old, she has already graduated from a famous university, and her thesis was published in a famous journal. She is very good at household chores. At the end of the 4th novel, she moves in with the student council members. While most of the student council members say that the engagement doesn't count due to her age, Akiko views her as a love rival. However, after arguing over which of them is better for Akito, the two of them decide to work together as they have noticed that Akito sees both of them as his sisters rather than as potential love interests. She has a habit of going silent and showing her emotions on her face when she is upset, which is so cute that people who see it can't resist accepting her will. She also has the habit of stripping naked in her sleep. ; : :Kōichirō Shindo's personal editor, Kaoruko worries that Akito has a sister complex and is trying to fix the situation. Kaoruko worries about this is because of the way Akito writes about BroXSis doujins. The two main characters in his novel even sharing a similar name to his and Akiko. She tries at first to seduce Akito at the office when they were alone together, but was mistaken by Akito as Kaoruko imitating a story that he read. ==MediaLight novel=== OniAi started as a Japanese light novel series, written by Daisuke Suzuki, with illustrations by Gekka Urū.

Like similar wide-area surveillance systems, such as Gorgon Stare, ARGUS-IS or the aerostat-mounted Kestrel, Constant Hawk was designed to give operators a fuller view of an area (such as a battlefield or operating base) than they would normally get from standard full-motion video cameras. The Army first deployed Constant Hawk in 2006 as part of a Quick Reaction Capability to help combat enemy ambushes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq. Constant Hawk flew on Short 360-300s in Iraq under the command of Task Force ODIN. And the system was introduced to Afghanistan in 2009, where it is still in use aboard MC-12W Liberty aircraft. ==Development== Initial work on Constant Hawk began in the early 2000s (decade) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the Sonoma Persistent Surveillance Program, a U.S. Department of Energy effort to monitor nuclear proliferation. In 2005, Constant Hawk was passed to the U.S. Department of Defense, which led to its development under the Army Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, MD. Since 2005, MIT has been developing processing algorithms enabling efficient formation, exploitation and dissemination of Constant Hawk imagery. In 2009, BAE Systems provided an additional, infrared payload for Constant Hawk called the Airborne Wide Area Persistent Surveillance Sensor (AWAPSS). In 2013, the MIT sensor MASIVS was deployed by Constant Hawk increasing pixel counts by an order of magnitude and providing full color imagery processed in real-time on board the aircraft. ==Features== Constant Hawk includes a 96-megapixel camera as part of its sensor suite and software that detects changes and patterns in collected imagery. This allows intelligence analysts to detect roadside bombs and prepared ambushes. ==Upgrades and Similar Systems== In 2007, the U.S. Marine Corps developed an upgrade to Constant Hawk called Angel Fire. In 2011, a Constant Hawk spinoff called Kestrel began deployment on aerostats in Afghanistan. Additionally, many of Constant Hawk's capabilities have been miniaturized or improved in newer wide-area persistent surveillance systems such as Logos Technologies' Kestrel. Kestrel reduces size and weight, while increasing image resolution and adding a day/night surveillance capability. In addition, the U.S. Air Force is working on Gorgon Stare, a wide-area persistence surveillance system designed for the MQ-9 Reaper. Gorgon Stare was initially scheduled for deployment in 2010. Another system still in development by DARPA is ARGUS-IS. ==See also== * Wide-area_motion_imagery ==References== Category:Military intelligence collection Category:United States Army equipment ","title":"Constant Hawk"},{"id":"35861334","text":"Tsai Cheng-fu (; 1929 - 13 July 2016)Tsai Cheng-fu's obituary was a Taiwanese hurdler who competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics.

As it developed the theme changed from one of solely popular songs to encompass many older traditional songs, aiming to spread the popularity of the book to a wider audience. It is now an invaluable source of historical reference providing wealth of information. The second edition followed in the following year of 1863. 1864 saw the third edition now entitled \\"A choice collection of Tyneside songs by E. Corvan, G. Ridley, J.P. Robson, R Emery ... etc.”. 1872, a further edition was published. The edition of 1873 was called \\"A choice collection of Tyneside songs by Wilson, Corvan, Mitford, Gilchrist, Robson, Harrison, Emery, Ridley, Oliver, Shield, &c;,. &c.;, &c.; with lives of the authors illustrated with views of the town and portraits of the poets and eccentrics of Newcastle.\\" It was published by Allan, 62 Dean Street, Newcastle upon Tyne: & 16 Collingwood Street, North Shields. (\\"Ralph Allan, Tyne Street, Newcastle upon Tyne\\" was also mentioned on the cover, possibly as a seller) The final edition was published in 1891 and was now called “Allan's illustrative edition of Tyneside Songs and readings with lives, portraits and autographs of the writers and notes on the songs. Revised edition.\\" The publisher was Thomas & George Allan, 18 Blackett Street and 34 Collingwood Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, and the cover stated that it was \\"Sold by W Allan, 80 Grainger Street & B Allan, North Shields: & W Scott of London.\\" == Publication == It is, as the title suggests, a collection of songs which would have been popular, or topical, at the date of publication. There is a considerable amount of additional material relating to biographies and very interesting articles on the lives of the authors, together with historical comments of the day which had influenced them in their choices of songs. == Contents == The contents of the final (1891) edition are: {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !width=70 abbr=\\"page\\"page !width=300 abbr=\\"title of song\\"title !width=200 abbr=\\"author\\"songwriter !width=130 abbr=\\"tune/air\\"tune !width=250 abbr=\\"comments\\" comments !width=70 abbr=\\"Notes\\"Notes !width=350abbr=\\"Ref\\" Ref - vContents (pages \\"v\\" to \\"x\\") -   - v Part I – introduction - vIntroductory Note - vi to xviContents - 1Part II – The main section - 1(Weel May) The Keel RowTraditional – before 1760¹ - 1a mention ofJoihn StokoeWriting in the Monthly Chronicle ³ - 1a mention ofWilliam ShieldA famous Swalwell musician³ - 1a mention ofJoseph RitsonRitson's \\" Northumberland Garland\\" 1703³  - 1(Weel May) The Keel RowStreet version - 2Waggoner (The)not given - 2Bobby ShaftoeTraditional¹ - 2a mention ofWilliam Brockie³ - 2a mention ofCuthbert SharpThe Bishoprick Garland 1834³ - 3Bonny Pit Laddie (The)not given - 3a mention ofJoseph RitsonNorthumberland Garland or Newcastle Nightingale³ - 4Bonny Keel Laddie (The)unknown - 4a mention ofRichard Oliver Heslopfrom \\"Northumberland Words\\"³ - 5Ride through Sandgatenot givenfragment of old rhyme about the siege of 1644 - 5a mention ofCuthbert SharpThe Bishoprick Garland 1834³ - 5Collier's Wedding – (The)Edward Chicken - 5Short bioEdward Chicken - 5a mention ofMr W CallPublished a new version of the song in 1829³ - 8My Eppie not given - 8a mention ofWilliam Brockie³ - 9Northumbrian's Sigh for his Native Country (The) - 9Sair Fail'd, Hinneynot givenVariation on \\"The awd man to the oak tree\\" - 10a mention ofCuthbert SharpThe Bishoprick Garland 1834³ - 10Old Man and the Oak (The)not givenVariation on \\"Sair Fail'd, Hinney\\"from Ritson, in \\"Gammer Gurton's Garland - 10a mention ofJoseph RitsonGammer Gurton's Garland³ - 10Short bioThomas Whittle - 11William Carstairs, SchoolmasterThomas Whittleon one of his contemporaries - 11Short bioWilliam Carstairs - 12Sawney Ogilby's Duel with his WifeThomas Whittle - 13Little Moody, Razor-setter Thomas Whittle - 15Jesmond Dene ³a mention of – and Lord Armstrong³ - 15Short bioPhill “Primrose” Hodgson - 15Une BagatellePhill “Primrose” Hodgson - 15Jessamond MillPhill “Primrose” Hodgson - 16Pandon Deneoriginally named as \\"Bosalinda\\" – or \\"Rosalinda\\" May have been a Miss Harrey of NewcastleA-G2 - 18Short bioJohn Cunningham - 19Elegy on a Pile of Ruins – Extract from John CunninghamNo....tho' the palace bar her golden gate - 19Death of John Cunningham – (Lament on the)Robert Gilchrist - 20Holiday Gown John Cunningham - 21North Shields Song (A)not given - 22Alice Marley – (A new song made on)unknownAn Alewife at Pictree, near Chester-le- Street - 23Donocht Head George PickeringYe Banks and Braes - 23Short bioGeorge Pickering - 25Collier's Rant (The)unknown - 25a mention ofSir Cuthbert Sharp³ - 27Little P.

The famine in Ireland had already caused many of the Irish to seek refuge in Liverpool, where famine fever raged among the Irish residents. With his own money Fr. Murphy purchased a Methodist Chapel in the district, which he converted into a Catholic church. For three years he ministered to the spiritual and physical needs of his fellow Irish men and women. ==Return to Cork== In 1847, his uncle, Bishop Murphy, of Cork died, and was succeeded by Bishop Delany, who recalled Fr. Murphy back to Cork and appointed him as chaplain to the Presentation Sisters in Bandon, Co. Cork. That same year, at his own request, he was transferred to Goleen (Schull). Again out of his own resources he provided food for the victims of the Famine. In 1848 he was recalled to Cork City and appointed administrator of Ss. Peter & Paul's. His first duties as administrator was the provision of a larger church to replace the inadequate Carey's Lane Church. ==Founder== Fr. John Murphy contributed largely out of his own funds to build Ss. Peter and Paul's Church in 1866. In addition to this, he founded the Mercy Hospital in 1867, which had formally been the Mansion House, but was then used as the Diocesan Seminary - administered by the Vincentian Fathers. On its being turned into a hospital, the Vincentian Order founded a new home in St. Patrick's Place, which became known as St. Finbarr's Seminary. Fr. Murphy also built the Chapel and residence at the North Infirmary Hospital for the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. ==Death== Murphy died oo 10/3/1883 i St. Vincent's Presbytery, Sunday's Well Rd., Cork.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 6, 2012. The episode plot mainly revolves around Roger rediscovering his alter-ego \\"Ricky Spanish\\" and Steve helping Roger's alter-ego make amends with everyone he has wronged. This episode was written by Erik Sommers and directed by Shawn Murray. This episode generally received positive reviews; Kevin McFarland from The A.V. Club rated this episode a B. It features guest performances from Werner Herzog, Rose Byrne and Wayne Brady, as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses from the series. ==Plot== After a pack of caterpillars chew holes in most of Roger's disguises, Roger rediscovers an outfit in the back of the closet. He puts it on excitedly, unable to recall the persona to which it belongs, only to discover that when he walks through town he draws stares of hatred, culminating in an assault at the hands of Brian Lewis. Roger is reminded that the persona is Ricky Spanish, the most hated man in town. Roger goes into hiding and has Steve bring him another outfit, then on the way home he tells Steve that Ricky was the worst persona he ever created, and that he has earned the hatred of every single person in Langley Falls in one way or another. Using one of the caterpillars he placed into a jar as a metaphor for changing, Steve convinces Roger to let him help Ricky try to make right all the wrong that he has done. Roger and Steve go first to Brian's houseboat where Brian recalls how Ricky knocked him out and left him penniless and without ID in Tijuana. Next they go to Bullock's house, where Ricky has to remind a coked-up Bullock of how he killed his wife. Both Brian and Bullock forgive him. Next on the list is Daniel, a former partner-in-crime that Ricky let take the fall in a sweater heist. After getting Daniel out of jail, Steve stops Daniel from killing Roger/Ricky on the spot, insisting that he has changed. Later, at a Burger Joint, Roger secretly reveals to Daniel that he has another heist plan and that Steve will take the fall for this one. Borrowing Brian Lewis' houseboat and guns from Bullock, they arrive at the docks where Steve learns of the plan and is knocked out by Daniel. Steve comes to after a short time and tries to stop them but the guards are alerted and give chase. When Steve starts to fall from a stack of shipping containers, he is caught by Roger who steals his wallet before letting him drop and be beaten by the guards below and Ricky and Daniel take off. Steve spends time in prison before being freed by Stan and Francine, while the butterfly in the jar emerges but dies in captivity. Werner Herzog provides narration over the final scene, and a title card stating 'A Werner Herzog Film' appears. Meanwhile, Stan and Francine are in for a surprise when Tungee, their sponsored child from Africa shows up on their doorstep. While not even sure if he was real, they had sent encouraging letters inviting him to someday come live with them. His enthusiastic attitude leads them to ditch Tungee at a Costgo, but once home they begin to have regrets about what they have done and rush back, reuniting with Tungee in a psychedelic sequence and promising never to leave him again. On the ride home, Tungee's perkiness immediately begins to annoy them once more and they leap out of the car, allowing it to roll down the road with Tungee still inside staring in horror from the rear window. Stan and Francine immediately begin to miss Tungee once again. ==Production== Wayne Brady (pictured) guest starred in this episode as Tungee. This episode was written by Erik Sommers and directed by Shawn Murray. Seth MacFarlane, the creator and executive producer of American Dad!, as well as its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, served as the executive producer for the episode, along with series veterans Mike Barker, Rick Wiener, Matt Weitzman, and Kenny Schwartz. In addition to the regular cast, John DiMaggio, JB Smoove, Nick Kroll, Rose Byrne, Werner Herzog, and Wayne Brady guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Elizabeth Banks, Mike Barker, Mike Henry, Patrick Stewart and John Viener made minor appearances as well. ==Reception== \\"Ricky Spanish\\" first aired on May 6, 2012 in the United States as part of the animated television night on Fox. Like most of the season, the episode was last in the animation television line-up. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. This episode was watched by 4.82 million U.S. viewers, with a 2.3/6 rating share in the 18–49 demographic group. The episode received generally positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying: \\"The final few minutes are fantastic, as the episode takes a wild leap and becomes a Werner Herzog documentary, with split screen comparisons and soothing, whimsical narration from the famed filmmaker. Steve is like the butterfly, but survives and gets out. Sure, it’s a tacked- on, completely ridiculous way to punt an actual ending, but it’s also really funny. Not every episode of American Dad will pack an emotional wallop, and this was a light, breezy romp through Roger’s penchant for dress-up that had plenty of laughs and nothing egregiously grating.\\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of TV Equals gave this episode a positive review saying: \\"Like many episodes of American Dad, tonight’s episode ended on a dark note. The beautiful butterfly that Steve had been protecting emerged from its cocoon only to wilt and die in a jar at sea; a muscular Steve emerged from his prison cell filled with rage and hatred; and Tungee was forever lost to the Smiths after they abandoned him in the back of their running car. Despite the rather depressing story endings, the episode overall was still very funny. The Werner Herzog bit at the end was fantastic and completely unexpected and in retrospect, it kind of put the entire episode into a new light.\\" == References Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American Dad!

However he quit the party one year later, because he considered the party's leadership was compromising. After that he became a member of the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party (FKGP) on January 12, 1990. He served as chairman of the party in his birthplace between 1990 and 1991. He was a strong supporter of József Torgyán. He unsuccessfully ran for the parliamentary seat for Komárom-Esztergom County 5th Constituency in the elections in 1990. He became Deputy Chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party in July 1994. He was elected to a member of the National Assembly during the 1994 elections from the party's National List. He was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. After the 1998 elections, Gyimóthy became a deputy speaker of the parliament. He frequently used yellow and red cards to rebuke of MPs. In 2000, former Prime Minister Gyula Horn called FKGP leader Torgyán as \\"Pubi\\", that is why Gyimóthy called him to order. Horn answered: \\"This is offensive? Do not be silly, Géza!\\" This moment became a political anecdote in Hungary. In 2001-2002 the FKGP split into two parts and Gyimóthy's relation with the Party Chairman decayed. He was a candidate for the position of Minister of Agriculture, when Torgyán resigned, however he was expelled from the party by Torgyán. As a result, Gyimóthy also lost his legislative deputy speaker function. After the failure 2002 Hungarian parliamentary election for the FKGP, he retired from the politics. ===Trivia=== Géza Gyimóthy was one of the founders of the Szená- torok, the official choir of the National Assembly of Hungary. ==References== *Parlament.hu *Énekes kedvű kisgazda a Torgyán-utód: ápolt bajusszal a koalíciós viszony ápolásáért *Aki sárgalapot mutatott Horn Gyulának Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian Democratic Forum politicians Category:Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party politicians Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1994–1998) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1998–2002) ","title":"Géza Gyimóthy"},{"id":"35861578","text":"Sport Aviation is an aviation magazine published since 1953 starting as The Experimenter.

It has been extensively (and often destructively) excavated over the past century. Many of the objects found at the site are held in the nearby Musée du Pays Châtillonnais. Vertillum was classified as a Historical Monument in 1875. It includes many buried structures, remains of ramparts, thermal baths and a temple. A Gallic oppidum covering about originally occupied the site, surrounded by a stone wall and ditch. Later it evolved into a Gallo-Roman settlement with the typical features of such cities: residential areas, a forum, baths, temple and administrative center. The Roman town would have had between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Excavations in the 19th and early 20th centuries were extremely destructive. Formerly well-preserved buildings, particularly the baths, were destroyed. Vertillum was a center for working copper-based alloys. Unfinished objects and waste material show that the smiths used foundry techniques to work sheet iron and to bronze the iron objects. These include handles, dishes and keys, some ornate and some simple. Unfortunately, the archaeological setting of the older discoveries was not recorded, so it is not possible to define a chronology of metal working at the site.

In 2011, Kumra co-wrote and provided vocals for Tottenham-born rapper Wretch 32's highest charting single to date, \\"Don't Go\\", which reached number one in the official UK charts. == Biography == Early life and career beginnings Kumra grew up in a family home in Swindon, Wiltshire.Biography. joshkumra.com Kumra is one-quarter Indian (his grandfather was from New Delhi) and started playing the guitar 12 years old, which naturally led to him teaching himself to sing. Kumra is a former student of The Academy of Music and Sound in Swindon. === 2011: Breakthrough === In early 2011, Kumra moved from Swindon to London to pursue a career in music and in the first month, met Wretch 32 and together, they created the \\"Don't Go\\" collaboration which went on to reach number one in the UK charts. Due to the song's instant success, Kumra joined Wretch 32 to perform the song on one of the UK's only major music TV shows, Later With Jools Holland and at many of the summer's major festivals. Regarding his subsequent appearance at V Festival, he stated that it was one of his biggest highlights; \\"Me and Wretch performed Don't Go on the same day that it went to number one. It was an incredible feeling; they had to take away the barriers in the tent we were playing in because it was just getting rammed as there were a couple thousand more people than there should've been in there.\\" === 2012–present: Good Things Come To Those Who Don't Wait === Following his success with Wretch 32, Kumra signed to Sony Records, releasing his debut solo effort on 15 July 2012. The single, 'Helicopters & Planes' had its video premiere on Vevo on 18 May. The track features Roc Nation rapper K Koke. He has supported many artists, including Gabrielle Aplin and in late 2012, Kumra joined Nina Nesbitt on her tour as a support act – he also supported Lianne La Havas in early 2013. In April 2013, he supported OneRepublic on their European tour. His debut album 'Good Things Come To Those Who Don't Wait' was released on 22 April 2013, featuring songwriting and production collaborations with Fink, Emeli Sandé, Naughty Boy and Mr Hudson. “We didn't have a brief, we just did what we wanted,\\" says Josh. \\"We had total freedom to mix up soul, blues and gospel songwriting, sometimes with big hip hop beats. But there's no production for the sake of it. And ultimately it comes down to me, the bedroom singer-songwriter with a guitar in my hand. That's what I wanted to come across.\\" The album is, he considers, \\"about my journey, which might sound clichéd, but it's true. The songs are about me, but also about things I've observed. They're love songs, mainly.\\" == Artistry  Influences === Kumra cites Tracy Chapman's self- titled album, The Rolling Stones and Experience by Jimi Hendrix as his three most influential albums whilst growing up.

The term Brazilians in Nigeria can also otherwise refer to first generation expatriates from Brazil. Starting from the 1830s, many emancipated Africans who had been through forced labour and discrimination in Brazil began moving back to Lagos, bringing along with them some cultural and social sensibilities adapted from their sojourn in Brazil. These emancipated Africans were often called \\"Aguda\\" or \\"Amaro\\", and also included returnees from Cuba. ==History== Bahia woman, 1885 At the height of the Transatlantic slave trade in West Africa, many prisoners of war or those kidnapped for sale in slave markets were sold to Europeans and transported across the Atlantic. Estimates of the number of slaves from the Gulf of Guinea to Brazil totaled about 300,000 in the nineteenth century. The captives disembarked in Bahia before moving further south to work on plantations, assist tradesmen or hawk goods for white Brazilians. As some gained manumission, earned savings or got deported as a result of racism, waves of African migration back to the West African coast developed. By the middle nineteenth, an Afro-Brazilian community began to emerge along the West African coast, developed by descendants of slaves who had twice crossed the Atlantic. These Africans brought back Afro-Brazilian sensibilities in food, agriculture, architecture and religion. The first recorded repatriation of African people from Brazil to what is now Nigeria was a government-led deportation in 1835 in the aftermath of a Yoruba and Hausa rebellion in the city of Salvador known as the Malê Revolt. After the rebellion, the Brazilian government - fearful of further insurrection - allowed freed or manumitted Africans the option to return home or keep paying an exorbitant tax to the government. A few Africans who were free and had saved some money were able to return to Africa as a result of the tough conditions, taxation, racism and homesickness. In 1851, 60 Mina Africans put together $4,000 to charter a ship for Badagry. After slavery was abolished in Cuba and Brazil in 1886 and 1888 respectively, further migration to Lagos continued. Many of the returnees chose to return to Nigeria for cultural, missionary and economic reasons. Many of them descended from the Yoruba. In Lagos, they were given the watery terrains of Popo Aguda as their settlement. By the 1880s, they comprised about 9% of the population of Lagos. Towards the end of 1920, the migration stopped. Though coastal Lagos was the preferred destination, most of the returnees were descendants of groups such as Ijeshas, Oyos, Ijebu and Egba based in the interior. The Agudas were aware of their home cities but preferred to set up shop in Lagos because it was conducive for trade, they were warmly received in Badagry and also because of on-going wars in the interior. A ship with Agudas docking in Badagry would be welcomed by crowds of children hailing them as they disembarked from the ship, whereas in the hinterlands strangers were viewed with suspicion. In some cases, the Oba of Lagos gave them land to build a house and provided men to assist them in their transition to local life. This notwithstanding, Lagos was different from Bahia. The elder returnees were comfortable, but many of the children were foreign to Lagos. They held on to elements of Bahia culture such as Catholicism and formed a close knit community within Lagos Island. Because of the retention of Catholicism and Western dressing, indigenous Africans called them \\"black whites\\" or Agudas. Keen on acquiring wealth in Africa, some of the earliest Agudas were morally ambivalent on issues such as slavery and became slave traders themselves,such as Francisco Felix de Sousa and Domingo Martinez. ===Settlement=== When Agudas arrived from Bahia and Pernambuco, they took up residence on the Eastern parts of Lagos on land provided by Oba Ojulari. In 1852, this region was demarcated as the Brazilian quarters (what later came to be known as Popo Aguda). During this time, metropolitan Lagos followed the racial and cultural characteristics evident in the city. The Saros lived in Olowogbowo, a tract of land on the Western corner of Lagos Island, Europeans lived and traded along the long stretch of the Marina and indigenous Lagosians lived on the Northwestern areas of the island. The westernmost corner of Brazilian quarters reached the easternmost parts of Olowogbowo at Tinubu Square, while the center of the Brazilian area was Campos Square - named after Cuban returnee Hilario Campos. Other major streets include Bamgbose and Tokunboh. Within the quarters diasporic sensibilities were evident, the community lacked signs of ethnic grouping, and fluidity was present in the religious practices of the residents. Popo Aguda was also a commercial center of trade, serving as a distribution center for imported goods. Its chief, the Onipopo, today presides over various ceremonies of remembrance that take place in the quarters. A sister community of Brazilians also exists in Ago Egba, the Egba colony in Lagos, which is located on the mainland in Ebute Metta. ==Culture== Returnees from Brazil and their present- day descendants were and are more commonly called \\"Agudas\\" (from , a non- standard Portuguese word for cotton properly rendered as ) or \\"Amaro\\". Most were Catholics, but some worshiped African Orishas which they brought from Brazil. Some of the Agudas are also Muslims. Most of them still have Portuguese names. Some common Portuguese family names in Nigeria include Da Silveira, De Silva, De Souza, and Moreira. In the 1800s, the major distinguishing set of classification was by birth, Agudas taken captive from West Africa who emigrated back to Lagos were called Papae or Mamae and those who were born in Brazil and then returned were called Yaya or Yayo. The British annexation of Lagos in 1861 and the promotion of trade benefited the Brazilian community. Along with the Saros, they became a rising bourgeois. They utilized a western style of dressing, owned race horses and organized waltzes, square dances and musical soirees where Molière was performed. However, with time many began to embrace their heritage and when the children of the returnees were grown, they came to embrace Lagos as their home. The annexation of Lagos that led to the rise of this wealthy class also came with the realisation that the colonists were not leaving soon and any hope of forming a political class was dim. The Brazilians began to cultivate relationships with the traditional authorities in Lagos, while some renewed relationships with Africans in the hinterland by supplying them with weapons. Agudas supplied weapons to the Ijeshas in the war against Ibadan. Beginning in the 1880s, many began to change their names to African ones while the Aurora relief Society was formed to research their culture. Agudas' cuisine in the early 1920s included food considered African in Bahia but considered different from those eaten by indigenes on the Island. They ate pirão de caranguejo during holidays and prepared , (porridge) and (coconut milk beans) as food staples. In agriculture, the returnees also popularized the use of Cassava as a food crop.Faluyi p 11,12. Agudas celebrated Easter with the coming out of Caretas or masked figures, burrinha at Epiphany and Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Our Lord of the Good End) associated with Obatala was celebrated during yuletide. Popo Aguda was a close-knit community and residents were known for their thriftiness and a strong work ethic. ===Religion=== A majority of the Agudas were Catholics, but the community had a significant number of Muslim families and those who still adhered to the traditional religion. Religious differences were not as important nor divisive as they were to indigenous Africans, and they were comfortable marrying from any of the three religions. Prior to the construction of a pro-cathedral, mass was performed in a bamboo building on Broad St, the plot of land where St Mary Convent was later built on. The first priest was Padre Anthonio, he was in charge of the Catholic church before the coming of French missionaries. The practice of baptism was important to the local community and it was also a way to enter the Aguda community. A cathedral, the Holy Cross Pro-Cathedral was completed in 1881, financed by funds from the lay congregation. It was designed to be the most significant structure in Lagos colony when completed. Originally built with one tower, a few years later another tower was added with the structure forming a cruciform structure with two towers. The Church was built by Agudas, but its construction was supervised by French missionaries. Among the builders were the quartet of Francisco Nobre (built one of the towers), Balthazar dos Reis, João da Costa and Lázaro Borges da Silva (master bricklayer) along with their apprentices. This group also built the old Central Mosque, called Jamiu Central Mosque. ==Trade== Trade between Lagos and Brazil rose in the 1860s and in 1869, Brazil was the third largest exporter to Lagos, very much behind Britain but ahead of France. Returnees in Lagos dominated the trade with Brazil and sold cotton, traditional artifacts and kola-nuts to Africans in Bahia. However, this Transatlantic trade gradually declined and by the beginning of the Twentieth century it was virtually non existent. They had pioneered trade with Brazil in the mid nineteenth century but by the 1880s, ruinous competitors and an economic downturn had forced many to abandon the export trade. Agriculture soon became an avenue to supplement shortfalls in economic activity. Before the downturn, many traders had acquired wealth and became prominent families within the community in Lagos. Such patriarchs included Angelo Campos, Esan da Rocha and Joaquim Branco (originally settled in Dahomey) who were able to sponsor their children for further education in Bahia, Havana or Europe. In Bahia, Afro-Brazilians formed the bulk of skilled labor, Aguda returnees brought along trade skills mastered in Bahia and preferred to teach their children a trade or handicraft such as masonry, carpentry or tailoring. Some worked as clerks for the European trading companies. In 1897, of the 96 qualified Aguda artisans listed in a directory, 11 were bricklayers and builders, 6 were cabinet makers, 9 tailors, 21 carpenters, 17 clerks and 24 traders. The leading dressmaker in Victorian Lagos was Yaya Clemencia Guinaries. The Brazilians who engaged in trading of goods also had the benefit of using their connection to their home cities to bypass traditional channels of trade by opening direct routes from Lagos to the interior and ignoring the traditional market cities and middlemen. Apart from trading in goods, investment in properties was also common among the wealthier families. ==Architecture== Baroque style, Bahia Brazilian architecture in Nigeria is a legacy of the thousands of freed slaves who returned to Nigeria in the 19th century.\\"IN NIGERIA, TOUCHES OF BRAZILIAN STYLE\\", The New York Times, 26 March 1987. Trained as carpenters, cabinetmakers, masons and bricklayers in Brazil, the ex-slaves were notably technically skilled artisans and were known for their exuberant and individualistic style on doorways, brightly painted facades and chunky concrete columns which are rooted in the baroque styles popular in Brazil in the 18th century. In early 1800s Lagos, the dominant architectural style was mud houses and houses with stilt using thatched leaves as roofing; these houses were usually divided into compartments to hold the extended family. The residence of the Oba and chiefs were much bigger, they had large courtyards, pillars and arches, a mixture of European and indigenous styles. The European influence took root during the reign of Oba Akinsemoyin who invited Portuguese slavers to Lagos,and the slavers in return renovated his palace using imported bricks from Portugal for the structure and roofing slates. In the 1830s, the migration of emancipated returnees began to change the architectural style. Influenced by the symmetrical plans of the Brazilian colonial house, they introduced a new architectural style to Lagos that was soon embraced by wealthy traders. The Brazilian style of architecture became dominant in Lagos Island by the end of the 19th century. The structures were one storey houses built for middle class residents and others were two or three storeys stuccoed buildings (sobrados) built for wealthier clients. The detached storey buildings conferred prestige on the owners. They were built with shuttered windows, had spaces between the top of the wall and the roof and with a compound. A ground floor usually opens to the street and was sometimes used as a storage, store or housing the domestic help. The houses were built for a nuclear family in contrast to the extended family structure of early Yoruba architecture. This style was prominent in old Lagos during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries but as the city grew, many of the houses have been remodeled or demolished to make way for bigger houses. ===Historical buildings=== * Hephzhi bar house: This house was completed in 1924. It was the residence of P.H. Williams, a Lagos merchant whose parents traveled back to Africa from Trinidad when he was a young boy. The house is a three storey building designed by Herbert Macaulay. The front door opens to a large passage that will lead guests to the living room, two adjoining bedrooms were at the sides. A wooden staircase goes upstairs with the same pattern like the floor below but with smaller passages and rooms. The windows are large and are located at both sides of the structure and also at the back of the building. Afro-Brazilian Catholic Church in Bahia * Holy Cross Cathedral: This was the first Catholic Church and the first brick church built in Lagos. Construction started in 1878 and it was finally completed in 1880. The appearance of the structure is cruciform with aisle naves, transepts and two towers. Though the Brazilian workers preferred a baroque style, the French missionaries who supervised construction imposed a Gothic style that was used. After many years, the two towers were demolished and the Eastern end was enlarged. * Water House: This house was built by Joao Esan da Rocha and then expanded by his son, Candido. It was called the Water House because Joao Esan dug a well at the backyard which was used to sell pipe water to Lagosians. He wanted the house built in a style similar to the house he lived in in Bahia after he gained manumission The house is Brazilian baroque and was originally built for a nuclear family, but structural extensions completed in the 1960s can accommodate more family members. ==See also== * Brazil–Nigeria relations * Tabom people * Nigerian Brazilian ==ReferencesSources== * * * Nigeria Brazilian Category:Brazil–Nigeria relations ","title":"Brazilians in Nigeria"},{"id":"35861981","text":"Yevgeny Yorkin (August 23, 1932 – November 13, 1982)Yevgeni Yorkin's profile at SportStrana.ru was an ice hockey player who played for the Soviet national team.

He has published papers including \\"Google and Art: A commercial/cultural new media art economy?\\" in the ISEA, Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts newsletter and \\"Net Art : au- delà du navigateur… un monde d’objets\\" (Net.art: beyond the browser to a world of things) in Terminal no. 101, \\"Net Art, Technologie ou Création?\\" (Net Art, Technology or Creation), spoken at conferences and events, curated exhibitions and live events, exhibited and performed in a number of international exhibitions and events including \\"Notes on a New Nature\\" at 319 Scholes, \\"The Vending Machine\\" at the 54th Venice Biennale, \\"REFF – Remix the World, Reinvent Reality\\" at Furtherfield Gallery, Jouable; Art, Jeu et Interactivité, and \\"Liminality: The Space Between Worlds\\" at Antena. ==Work== Lynch's work has developed based on a conceptual consideration of the use of networks within artistic practice. Moving initially from a net.art practice and its emphasis on the web and the web browser as artistic form to a networked practice that explores networks in their widest interpretation, his work uses networks as \\"a means, site and context for artistic initiation, creation and discourse\\". Informed by Cybernetics and Communication theory, his discourse frequently deals with issues concerning nodes and their arrangement, the spaces between or the internodal and the behaviour that can occur between nodes in a network. As such he views his work dealing with these concepts and issues as largely opportunist, potentially parasitic in nature and his practice as essentially one of arrangements aligning it with key concerns within conceptual art. He states that his networked practice aims \\"to get people to think about the ideas I'm making connections or links between. I personally like work that makes me think so I try to make work to make others think…What obsesses me is not the internet per se but the idea of networks, all sorts of networks, technological (digital, electronic and electrical), social, biological etc. My work is starting to be a networked art rather than net.art, an internet art\\". Garrett Lynch performing Trav-erse at REFF Furtherfield on 25 February 2011. Since 2001 curating has been a part of Garrett's practice. Initially curating online net.art works through the \\"Banner Art Collective\\", in 2006 he co-founded the sonic arts events \\"Open Ear\\" which ran ten live events at various locations in England and Wales until 2009. Lynch created the site-specific work for the online virtual world of Second Life \\"Between Saying and Doing\\" in 2008 as a critical comment on performance and virtual worlds. This initiated a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces that remains ongoing. In these works Lynch explores the \\"real\\" and the \\"virtual\\" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity. This process involves the use of his real name for his \\"representation\\" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a sandwich board prop stating this that is worn continuously. == References == Category:Irish contemporary artists Category:New media artists Category:Net.artists Category:Irish multimedia artists Category:Postmodern artists Category:Living people Category:Digital artists Category:Irish performance artists Category:Alumni of the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs Category:1977 births ","title":"Garrett Lynch"},{"id":"35862125","text":"Neomordellistena testaceispina is a beetle in the genus Neomordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

The IRT Nostrand Avenue Line splits from the local tracks of the Eastern Parkway Line south of the Franklin Avenue station. ==History Contract 2 line === The Eastern Parkway Line to Atlantic Avenue is part of Contract 2 of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's plan to construct an extension of the original subway, Contract 1. Contract 2 extended the original line from City Hall in Manhattan to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners approved the route on September 27, 1900, and the contract was signed on September 11, 1902. Construction commenced on Contract 2 on March 4, 1903.New York Times, Brooklyn Joyful Over New Subway, May 2, 1908, page 1 In order to cross the East River, a tunnel had to be constructed. That tunnel, the Joralemon Street Tunnel, was the first underwater subway tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn. It opened on January 9, 1908, extending the subway from Bowling Green to Borough Hall. Clifford Milburn Holland served as the assistant engineer during the construction of the tunnel. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 2006. On April 28, 1908, the IRT formally applied with the New York Public Service Commission for permission to open the final section of the Contract 2 line from Borough Hall to Atlantic Avenue near the Flatbush Avenue LIRR station. The application was approved, and the IRT extension opened on May 1, 1908. With the opening of the IRT to Brooklyn on May 1, 1908, ridership fell off on the BRT's elevated and trolley lines over the Brooklyn Bridge with Brooklyn riders choosing to use the new subway. During the construction of the Brooklyn extension, provisions were made for future subway extensions in Brooklyn by the construction of four tracks between Borough Hall and Atlantic Avenue, and the construction of bellmouths at Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue and Lafayette Avenue, and at Atlantic Avenue and Fourth Avenue. On May 26, 1908, the IRT applied with the Public Service Commission to build a route connecting with these provisions along Flatbush Avenue from Fulton Street along the Manhattan Bridge, connecting with the IRT Third Avenue Line at Canal Street and Bowery. === Dual Contracts expansion === In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of Contract 3 of the agreement, between New York City and the IRT, the original subway opened by the IRT in 1904 to City Hall, and extended to Atlantic Avenue in 1908, was to be extended eastward into Brooklyn. The line was to be extended along Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway to Buffalo Street as a four-track subway line, and then along East 98th Street and Livonia Avenue to New Lots Avenue as an elevated two-track line, with provisions for the addition of a third track. In addition, a two- track branch line along Nostrand Avenue branching off east of the Franklin Avenue station was to be constructed. The underground portion of the line became known as the Eastern Parkway Line, or Route 12, while the elevated portion became known as the New Lots Line. In addition, as part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build a branch of the original subway line south down Seventh Avenue, Varick Street, and West Broadway to serve the West Side of Manhattan. South of Chambers Street, there were to be two branches constructed. One of these branches would turn eastward under Park Place and Beekman Street and down William Street and Old Slip. After going through Lower Manhattan, the second branch would go through a tunnel under the East River before running under Clark and Fulton Streets until a junction at Borough Hall with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line, using a provision meant for a line over the Manhattan Bridge. Construction of the Clark Street Tunnel began on October 12, 1914, using a tunneling shield in conjunction with compressed air. The north tube was holed through on November 28, 1916. At 5,900 feet long, with about 3,100 feet underwater, the tunnel was finally opened for revenue service on April 15, 1919.New York Times, Open Clark Street Line, April 16, 1919, page 18 The opening of the tunnel allowed access to Brooklyn via the IRT from both the East and West Sides of Manhattan. This line was expanded as a part of the Dual Contracts from Atlantic Avenue east. The IRT Eastern Parkway Line was built as part of Route 12 from 1915 to 1918, from the section east of the Atlantic Avenue station to Utica Avenue and down the Nostrand Avenue Subway to Flatbush Avenue. On August 23, 1920, the Eastern Parkway Line was extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue. The new lines would be served by trains from Seventh Avenue. Trains operated via the express track between Atlantic Avenue and Franklin Avenue because of the failure of the contractor to perform work as scheduled on the local stations. On October 10, 1920, the three stations that were not ready to be opened with the rest of the line, at Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum, were opened. === Later history === On February 2, 1948 the platform extensions at Hoyt Street opened, allowing 10-car express trains to board as opposed to only 5-car trains. In August 1961, the chairman of the New York City Transit Authority, Charles Patterson, announced a $2.5 million project that would get rid of a trouble spot on the line between Nevins Street and Atlantic Avenue that slows service and backs up the IRT Division. The project was projected to take two years long and it would have involved the reconfiguration of the track layout in this area. The platforms at the two stations would be extended to accommodate 10-car trains, as opposed to the eight and nine-car trains that they could platform at the time. The tracks between the two stations would be straightened, removing some of the bend in the tracks, but not removing it entirely. The tracks were to be straightened enough to allow for the running time between the two stations to be cut by one to two minutes. During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza, Eastern Parkway, Nostrand Avenue and Kingston Avenue were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars. ==Extent and service== The following services use part or all of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line: { !rowspan=2 ! colspan=\\"3\\" Time period !rowspan=2Section of line - !rush hours and middays !evenings and weekends !late nights - width=10 align=center colspan=3local north of Franklin Ave–Medgar Evers College -  align=center colspan=2local  align=\\"center\\" no service full line -  align=center colspan=2express  align=\\"center\\" local skips Hoyt St north of Utica Ave (all except nights) full line (nights) -  align=centerexpress align=center colspan=2no service north of Franklin Ave–Medgar Evers College } === Route description === The IRT Eastern Parkway Line enters Brooklyn through the Joralemon Street Tunnel from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and continues to run under the street that the tunnel was named after, until after Borough Hall. East of Adams Street and Boerum Plaza, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line merges with the line and it runs under Fulton Street, then turns southeast under Flatbush Avenue, which also has the BMT Brighton Line beneath it. The first station along this segment is Nevins Street, which contains a never used lower level, and then joins Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center, the end of the oldest section of the line. Between Bergen Street and Grand Army Plaza, the line splits around the BMT Brighton Line. East of Grand Army Plaza, the line finally moves under its namesake, the first station serving the Brooklyn Museum. The next station is a complex near the Brooklyn Botanic Garden that serves the above ground BMT Franklin Avenue Line and the beginning of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line, which branches off to the south shortly afterwards at Nostrand Junction. The last three stations are a two-over-two track layout with a platform on each level. Afterwards, the IRT Eastern Parkway Line ends under Ralph Avenue, one block east of its originally intended terminus, whereas the local tracks become the IRT New Lots Line, branching off to the southeast emerging from the ground near Buffalo Avenue at Lincoln Terrace Park. The line was built mostly with two levels, with southbound trains on the upper level, and northbound trains on the lower level to protect the trees in the median of Eastern Parkway to the greatest extent possible. ==Station listing== {  - !Neighborhood (approximate) ! !Station !Tracks !Services !Opened !Transfers and notes - !colspan=8 style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"Express tracks continue from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line Express tracks via the Joralemon Street Tunnel () - rowspan=6Downtown Brooklyn -  ↑ Borough Hall all  January 9, 1908  (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line) (BMT Fourth Avenue Line at Court Street) Station is ADA-accessible in the northbound direction only - !colspan=6 style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"Local tracks continue from the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line Brooklyn Branch () -  Hoyt Street local  May 1, 1908  -  Nevins Street all  May 1, 1908  -  Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center all  May 1, 1908  (BMT Brighton Line) (BMT Fourth Avenue Line) Connection to LIRR at Atlantic Terminal - rowspan=3Prospect Heights  Bergen Street local  October 10, 1920  -  Grand Army Plaza local  October 10, 1920  -  Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum local  October 10, 1920  - rowspan=5Crown Heights  Franklin Avenue–Medgar Evers College all  August 23, 1920  (BMT Franklin Avenue Line at Botanic Garden) - !colspan=6 style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"IRT Nostrand Avenue Line splits from the local tracks () at Nostrand Junction -  Nostrand Avenue local  August 23, 1920 B44 Select Bus Service -  Kingston Avenue local  August 23, 1920  -  Crown Heights–Utica Avenue all nowrap nowrapAugust 23, 1920  B46 Select Bus Service - !colspan=7 style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"Express tracks end - !colspan=7 style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"Local tracks continue as the IRT New Lots Line () } ==References * Category:New York City Subway lines Category:Interborough Rapid Transit Company Category:Railway lines opened in 1908 Category:Railway tunnels on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City Category:1908 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"IRT Eastern Parkway Line"},{"id":"35862138","text":"Enrique \\"Kikin\\" Collazo (born 5 October 1988 in Adjuntas) is a professional boxer from Puerto Rico who competed for the 2012 Olympics as a middleweight (75 kg).

The rebellion was part of continued fighting in the region after the formal end of the Second Congo War in 2003. It broke out in 2012 and continued into 2013, when a peace agreement was made among eleven African nations, and the M23 troops surrendered in Uganda. In April 2012, former National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) soldiers mutinied against the DRC government and the peacekeeping contingent of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Mutineers formed a rebel group called the March 23 Movement (M23), also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army. It was composed of former members of the rebel CNDP, and allegedly sponsored by the government of the neighbouring states of Rwanda and Uganda. On 20 November 2012, M23 rebels took control of Goma, a North Kivu provincial capital with a population of one million people. By the end of November that year, the conflict had forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, in addition to the refugees already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the region. After repelling an ill-organized government counterattack and making some further gains, M23 agreed to withdraw from Goma on their own and left the city in early December. On 24 February 2013, eleven African nations signed an agreement designed to bring peace to the region. In October 2013, Congo told the UN that the M23 movement was virtually finished after being pushed back to a small area near Rwanda. On 7 November 2013, following significant defeats to a UN-backed government offensive, M23 troops crossed into Uganda and surrendered. ==Background== The Province of North Kivu (Nord-Kivu) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo In March 2009, National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) rebels signed a peace treaty with the government, in which it agreed to become a political party in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members. On 4 April 2012, it was reported that Bosco Ntaganda and 300 loyal troops defected from the DRC and clashed with government forces in the Rutshuru region north of Goma. According to M23 spokesman Vianney Kazarma, the defection was due to Joseph Kabila's cheating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2011. ==The conflictBeginning of hostilities=== Jason Stearns reported on 4 May 2012 that Colonel Sultani Makenga had joined the M23. Stearns commented that this \\"is a significant development, since Makenga was the second highest ranking CNDP officer behind Ntaganda in the Amani Leo structure as the deputy commander of South Kivu.\\" On 6 July 2012, M23 attacked and took the town of Bunagana less than a kilometer from the border with Uganda. Some 600 DRC troops fled across the border and took refuge in Uganda. The rebels issued a statement that they would cease their offensive if the government agreed to holding peace talks with them. The United Nations condemned rebel attacks in the region after an Indian peacekeeper was killed in the fighting. On 8 July, the rebels captured Rutshuru, 70 kilometers north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. By 10 July, they were 40 kilometers from the city of Goma. Witnesses said rebels appeared to be taking towns and villages with ease, with government troops usually melting away. The towns of Rubare and Ntamugenga had also reportedly fallen to the rebels. On 20 July, M23 and government forces exchanged heavy weapons fire around Kibumba and Rugari, forcing thousands of civilians to flee towards Goma. UN helicopter gunships were seen headed towards the front line. The security situation in eastern Congo was described as rapidly becoming worse. ===November M23 offensive=== Fighting broke out again in November 2012, with reports of heavy gunfire and explosions near Goma. Both sides blamed the other for the outbreak of hostilities. Government forces claimed M23 rebels suffered 110 dead, a claim the rebels denied. Government forces reportedly used tanks and helicopters in the fighting, which saw rebels advance closer to Goma nevertheless. On 15 November, MONUSCO helicopter gunships were deployed to support government forces as they fought to hold off a rebel attack south of Kibumba, flying 17 sorties and firing more than 500 rockets and missiles. The combined army and UN assault killed approximately 64 M23 fighters. However, the rebels resumed their offensive the next day and in larger numbers; their advance put them within 18 miles of Goma. The army retreated under heavy fire to the southern outskirts of Kibumba after being forced back by the rebels, according to the provincial governor. The government army began to regroup around the nearby town of Kilimanyoka after the retreat. Later rebels claimed to have seized control of Kibumba but said they had no plans on attacking Goma. A UN spokesman told that the M23 appeared to be well equipped with night vision equipment and 120mm mortars. On 18 November, it was reported that Congolese troops and the administration were leaving Goma in a hurry as M23 was at the gates of the city. The North Kivu governor left on a boat en route to South Kivu. The United Nations troops did not react when the rebels bypassed their camp on the road to Goma. The following day, M23 demanded that the Congolese government open peace talks, or face an escalation of fighting. Taking of Goma M23 rebels in Goma M23 forces began an assault against army positions in Goma on 19 November, sending mortar shells and machine gun fire into the city which was still being defended by the government army. M23 spokesman Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarma said \\"Fighting is already taking place on the streets of Goma this morning.\\" The DRC government spokesman confirmed the claim saying, \\"We have yet to stop this attack; they have not taken Goma yet.\\" Congolese army units were reported to be holding defensive positions in the city centre and the airport armed with tanks and machine guns. M23 forces entered the city proper on 20 November, advancing on foot up the main road towards the city centre. Heavy bursts of small arms fire could be heard in the city and near the airport. M23 was reported to have captured the Goma International Airport. Though other reports claimed that UN forces retained control of the airport, with Lt. Gen. Chander Prakash, commander of UN forces in the area claiming that M23 attacked the peacekeepers but were repelled. A South African peacekeeper from the MONUSCO force, pictured in 2013 M23 forces moved in two columns past Sake, eventually capturing most of Goma as well as a nearby border post with Rwanda. Some government soldiers took off their uniforms before fleeing the city. By late morning, Congolese government troops had been forced back to the west of the city, with many abandoning their positions and withdrawing westwards from Goma entirely. Rebels marched into the centre without a shot being fired as the government army fled and UN peacekeepers stood down. Local police surrendered their posts and weapons without resistance. M23 made a statement later on announcing: \\"The town of Goma fell at 11:33 local time, despite the attack helicopters, despite the heavy weapons, the FARDC [national army] has let the town fall into our hands.\\" Reuters reports on the scene confirmed that heavily armed M23 soldiers were present and walking through the city unchallenged, and that the UN peacekeepers present were not resisting the M23 advance through the city. Some residents came onto the streets to greet the rebel takeover. After guards of the local prison fled Goma, along with the national army, more than a thousand criminal prisoners escaped through a hole in the prison wall. The rebels ordered civil servants back to work, warning they will not tolerate corruption, and allowed the UN troops to continue to patrol the streets. DR Congo president Joseph Kabila urged the city's people to \\"resist\\" the group's takeover. UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey said peacekeepers \\"cannot substitute\\" for the national army, adding that the 1,500 UN troops in Goma held their fire because they did not want to risk civilian lives. UN Secretary General Ban Ki- moon criticized M23 for alleged human rights violations during the takeover, including destruction of property, \\"intimidation of journalists\\", and the abduction of women and children. Noting that the First Congo War had begun with fighting in the same region, the New York Times described Goma's takeover as \\"raising serious questions about the stability of Congo as a whole.\\" Continued fighting Almost 3,000 members of the Congolese army and police forces switched sides in Goma on 20 November and joined the rebellion as M23 continued its advance, seizing control of the town of Sake and stating that it intends to overthrow the national government. M23 forces began advancing towards the town of Bukavu, capital of South Kivu state on 21 November. They announced their next intended target after Bukavu as the city of Kisangani, the capital of Orientale Province. Government forces, despite having withdrawn from Sake, launched a counterattack to retake the city on 22 November leading to heavy clashes with M23 forces there. The surprise counterattack was badly beaten by the rebels. Thousands of hungry and demoralized government soldiers fled back in disarray to the town of Minova, around 50 km from Goma. They got drunk and reportedly began raping, looting and threatening civilians; the allegations were confirmed by an UN source for The Guardian, which described them as \\"angry and paranoid\\", and contrasted their appearance to the apparent discipline in the rebel ranks. The troops continued raping local civilian women and girls in a systematic way for three days, resulting in international outrage. The \\"UN condemned the atrocity as \\"horrifying\\" in its scale and systematic nature.\\" Mark Townsend, \\"Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo\\" , The Guardian, 13 June 2015; accessed 15 November 2017 The American Bar Association's office in Goma has identified 1,014 victims, but the UN had a final list of about 126. The DRC Army prosecuted officers in 2014 in what was called the Minova Trial, the largest rape trial in DRC history. Only a few junior officers were convicted. There has been insufficient financial support for the women who were victimized, and insufficient protection for them in the years since. ===Peace negotiations and M23 withdrawal=== MONUSCO troops around Goma, 2012 According to the chief of Uganda People's Defence Force, M23 leader met with him and agreed to let him mediate, which resulted in M23 agreeing to withdrawing their forces from Goma and Sake in principle, although a timeframe did not appear to have been agreed upon. However, a DRC military spokesman claimed that M23 had refused to abandon Goma and said: \\"They have refused to leave the city of Goma. This is a declaration of war, and we intend to resume combat.\\" Nevertheless, the next day the situation appeared to ease, with M23 agreeing to a withdrawal from captured territory, with the intention of eventually leaving Goma and returning to their original positions before they took the city. M23 rebels withdrawing from Goma, November 2012 On 1 December, M23 rebels pulled out of Goma, later under Congolese army control. ===Peace agreement=== On 24 February 2013, leaders of 11 African nations signed an agreement designed to bring peace to the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Among the signers were Rwanda and Uganda, both of whom had been accused of aiding the rebellion, a charge the nations deny. The deal, which was brokered by the United Nations, consists of two principle parts. First, it calls on the DRC to implement security reforms, work to strengthen its government, and increase cooperation with its neighbors. Second, it calls on neighboring countries to help structurally reform certain DRC organizations, but to otherwise refrain from interfering with DRC internal affairs. It also opens the possibility of a UN intervention brigade being established in the region. Several African countries have discussed contributing troops to an intervention force, which, if formed, would supplement the 17,000 UN military personal already working in the area. The M23 rebels were not represented in the deal's negotiations or at the signing. M23 spokesperson Bertrand Bisimwa said he had not read the agreement but hoped it would not reignite fighting. technical near Goma, March 2013 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he hopes the accord will usher in \\"an era of peace and stability\\" for Africa's Great Lakes region, but cautioned that the agreement \\"only the beginning of a comprehensive approach that will require sustained engagement.\\" He also said that a special envoy would be deployed in Congo in the near future. United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice said she welcomes the deal and called on the Congolese government to continue working towards peace. In a statement, European Union leaders Catherine Ashton and Andris Piebalgs called the agreement and appointment of a UN envoy \\"important steps\\" in the peace process and commended the spirit of \\"good neighborliness\\" demonstrated. However, regional analyst Theodore Trefon said the agreement was not a long-term solution. \\"You're not going to be able to impose peace from above or the outside on people who don't want peace\\", he remarked. On his blog about Congo, Jason Stearns agrees writing \\"So are we back in a peace process? Not really. Or more precisely: We don’t know yet. The agreement is more a statement of principles than a concrete action plan.\\" Separately, negotiations between the Congolese government and rebel leaders continued in neighboring Uganda. Ugandan Vice President Edward Ssekandi said the discussions had been productive thus far. Joseph Kabila said negotiations would continue, but added that time was running out to reach an agreement, citing the 15 March deadline for the talks. On 18 March 2013, Bosco Ntaganda turned himself in to the U.S. embassy in Kigali, Rwanda,BBC News – Bosco Ntaganda: Wanted Congolese in US mission in Rwanda . Bbc.co.uk (18 March 2013). Retrieved on 2013-09-04. where he requested transfer to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Though the reasons for his surrender are unknown it was speculated that he was either pressured to do so by Rwanda or feared infighting within the M23 movement and its military leader Sultani Makenga, which had recently forced Ntaganda's forces to flee the DRC into Rwanda. Though Rwanda was not a signatory to the Rome Statute, the media speculated it would be forced to turn him over to the ICC. The U.S. also had listed him on its War Crimes Rewards Programme. On 22 March, he was detained by the ICC. Four days later, he made his first appearance in front of the Court. ===Internal clashes=== On 25 February, disagreement between factions of the M23 about how to react to the peace agreement led to violence. M23's political leader, Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, was sacked. In a statement signed by M23's military leader, Sultani Makenga, he was accused of treason because of \\"financial embezzlement, divisions, ethnic hatred, deceit and political immaturity\\". Makenga declared himself interim leader and clashes between those loyal to Sultani Makenga and those loyal to Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, who is allied with Bosco Ntaganda, have killed ten men and two others were hospitalized. M23 has denied that it is hit by dissent. ===United Nations Force Intervention Brigade=== Tanzanian special forces form part of the intervention brigade In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council authorized the deployment of an intervention brigade within MONUSCO to carry out targeted offensive operations, with or without the Congolese national army, against armed groups that threaten peace in eastern DRC. The brigade is based in North Kivu and is made up of a total of 3,069 peacekeepers. It is tasked with neutralizing armed groups, reducing the threat posed to State authority and civilian security and make space for stabilization activities. In May 2013, fighting continued for the first time in six months as M23 attacked the government's forces north of Goma. At least 15 rebels and four government soldiers were killed in the fighting on 20 May as both sides traded artillery fire in the town of Mutaho near Goma after rebels tried to retake it from the government, which had recently seized it from them. Clashes once again broke out in July 2013, as M23 fought back against what it said was an army assault involving aircraft and artillery. Government forces used heavy weapons against the rebels in the town of Muja, just north of Goma. A government spokesman claimed that 120 M23 members were killed, and 10 army soldiers were killed. The claim could not be independently verified. During the same fighting government's forces were accused by the UN of mistreatment of M23 detainees and desecration of corpses of M23 combatants. On 24 July 2013 the government's Mil Mi-24 gunships, piloted by Ukrainian soldiers from high altitudes, inflicted heavy civilian casualties near the village of Rumangabo.Radio Okapi: DR Congo: Army pounded the positions of M23 Rumangabo. 24 July 2013. On 30 July the group were given a 48-hour ultimatum by the U.N. to leave the Goma area or face \\"use of force.\\" Between 21 and 29 August, heavy fighting outside Goma left 57 rebels, 10–23 government soldiers, 14 civilians and one Tanzanian U.N. peacekeeper dead. 720 government soldiers and 10 U.N. peacekeepers were also wounded. ===Congolese army offensive=== In late October, the Congolese army captured two towns from M23 rebels: Kiwanja and Buhumba, both of which are in the Rutshuru area of North Kivu province, near the Rwandan border. In October 2013, Congo told the UN that the movement was virtually finished after being pushed back from its key position at Mount Hehu and Rumanagabo, north of Goma, to an enclave near Rwanda. Congo also re- captured Kiwanja and Rutshuru and discovered mass graves. On 30 October, the first town seized by the rebels in 2012 was stormed by UN-backed Congolese troops as the rebels abandoned Bunagana. Following Uganda's calls for a ceasefire on 1 November and government shelling the next day, as well as a new offensive on 3 November in the hills around the border with Uganda and Rwanda, M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa called to \\"immediately end hostilities\\" and that \\"we call on the facilitator of the Kampala peace talks to immediately put in place a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire.\\" Despite the calls, the army accused the rebels of bombing Bunagana. Army spokesman Olivier Hamuli said: \\"This is not fighting, it is bombs launched by M23 targeting the population of Bunagana. They are targeting civilians.\\" Conversely, the rebels said that they were attacked with heavy weapons. Radio Okapi reported that four civilians were killed and 10 others were wounded in Bunagana on 4 November. UN, EU and AU envoys urged both sides not to undo the progress made in peace talks and that M23 should renounce its rebellion and the army should hold off from further military action. Rebel surrender Government troops of the FARDC near Goma in May 2013 The next day, following the two-week UN-backed offensive the government claimed to have defeated the rebels, as the group said it is ending its rebellion and would disarm and demobilise its forces in order to pursue a political solution. The announcement came hours after its fighters were driven out of its last two strongholds of Tshanzu and Runyoni at about 3:00. Bisimiwa issued a statement that read: \\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo.\\" Government spokesman Laurent Mende said that many rebel fighters were surrendering and that Congo was ready to pursue peace talks. The U.S. special envoy for the African Great Lakes region said from Pretoria: \\"In a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.\\" On 6 November 2013, the March 23 rebels fled the country.Defeated M23 rebels flee DRC. 6 November 2013, 11:11am / The next day, the rebels surrendered at Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda as about 1,500 fighters, believed to be most of the force were held after surrendering in Kisoro by the borders, this included Sultani Makenga.DR Congo rebels surrender in Uganda, Aljazeera. 7 November 2013. M23's surrender has sparked many questions of legal accountability for military leaders, such as Makenga, but also for lower level combatants and other parties to the conflict. ===Agreement=== At a meeting in Entebbe, Uganda, the Congolese government delegation left the talks after a failure to agree to a wording of a document intended to officially end the insurgency. Government spokesman Lambert Mende said: \\"Uganda seems now to be acting as part of the conflict. It has interests in M23.\\" At the same time, no dates for talks to resume were set. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was also accused of subverting the East African Community by marginalising the leaders of Burundi and Tanzania by not inviting them for the talks. Freedom and Unity Front leader General David Sejusa said: \\"He started that rebellion. He gave them arms, he gave them financial support, he gave them equipment, and he gave them uniforms. So, it's not like I’m talking out of the blue. But, then, the chameleon he is, he turns around and then he postures as if he's the one who wants to bring peace.\\" On 12 December 2013, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's spokesman, Manoah Esipisu, said that an agreement had been signed in Nairobi between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 movement. Despite the agreement, there were difficulties in pacifying the region. Over the 14–15 December weekend, at least 21 people were discovered to have been hacked to death in the area, although the perpetrators were not known. There were also concerns about DDR for M23 officers and soldiers who were in Uganda and Rwanda and fears of renewed instability. Furthermore, on 2 January, Colonel Mamadou Ndala, who helped lead the counter-operations, was killed in North Kivu province by the Allied Democratic Forces-NALU (ADF-NALU). ==Allegations of Rwandan involvement== A UN report stated that the rebels were getting support from Rwanda. According to the DR Congo government, 25 Rwandan members of M23 have surrendered as part of a total of over 370 M23 soldiers that have allegedly surrendered by 25 June. On 19 November, Rwanda claimed that the DRC government forces fired tank and mortar shells across the border into its territory. The DRC government confirmed the incident, but claimed that Rwanda shelled its own territory to justify a wider-scale intervention in the DRC. The U.S. government announced on 21 July that it would cut military aid to Rwanda. U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp stated that Rwandan authorities could be charged for \\"aiding and abetting\\" war crimes: \\"There is a line that one can cross under international law where you can be held responsible for aiding a group in a way that makes possible their commission of atrocities.\\" The United States cited Rwandan support for the M23 militia, while they employed child soldiers. Rwanda denied that it was backing the rebels, calling the accusation an attempt to make the nation a \\"scapegoat\\" for DRC's problems. The SANDF said it was unable to confirm that Rwanda has supported M23. On 30 November 2012, the United Kingdom's international development secretary Justine Greening declared that the UK government decided to withhold a multimillion-dollar aid payment to Rwanda over allegations that it is backing M23 rebels. Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo replied that the measure \\"is based on allegations of faulty reports which we have said for the last six months are wrong.\\" ==See also== *Laurent Nkunda ==Notes and referencesFootnotes=References= *Full text of the Agenda for the Dialogue between the Government of the DRC and the M23 on the situation in Eastern Congo, 16 January 2013, UN Peacemaker Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Africa Category:2012 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Conflicts in 2012 Category:Conflicts in 2013 Category:Rebellions in Africa Category:North Kivu Category:2013 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"M23 rebellion"},{"id":"35862161","text":"The candidate information for the Needham Market Ward in Mid-Suffolk, Suffolk, England.

After the discovery of her body, she was later buried at the Maple Mound Cemetery. One man was originally convicted of her murder on circumstantial evidence but was eventually released when the conviction was overturned. Harmon's murder was solved in 2010 when DNA from the individual who raped her was matched to Robert Anthony Buell. ==Case history== The polyester fibers found on Tina Harmon's body which matched the fibers from the van which was used in the abduction of Krista Harrison Tina Harmon was reportedly last seen with a man in his twenties after she had been dropped off by her father's girlfriend in Lodi, Ohio.

Nutmeg-colored carpet fibers and dog hair were found on her clothing.Monahan, Richard, dir. \\"Material Evidence.\\" Forensic Files. TLC, TruTV. October 31, 2000. Television. In 1982, Ernest Holbrook, Jr. and Henry Ray Rucker were convicted of both the rape and murder of Harmon, but after complications with the witnesses' testimonies, one of them recanted. Rucker was given a new trial and was released in 1983. ==Robert Anthony Buell== In 1984, Robert Anthony Buell was convicted of the 1982 murder of Krista Lea Harrison. The dog hairs on Harmon's body were matched to the ones found on a dog buried in Buell's yard, once DNA testing became possible. Buell was later matched to Harmon's murder by comparing his DNA samples with the ones found on Harmon's clothing several years later. In 2009, when the Harmon case was reopened, it was stated Buell's profile was obtained, but they did not have Tina's. The nutmeg-colored carpet fibers that were found on the bodies of both Harmon and Harrison matched as well. However, Buell was never tried for Harmon's murder because he was already on death row. In 2002, Buell was executed for the murder of Harrison at age 62. Cleveland Scene journalist James Renner wrote about similar characteristics of the murders of Harmon, Harrison, and Smith to the 1989 murder of Amy Mihaljevic, the latter two are currently unsolved. Although Buell was incarcerated at the time of Mihaljevic's death, he stated Buell's nephew Ralph Ross Jr. might be responsible and stated he could have been involved in the three preceding murders, if not the sole perpetrator. In 2008, the evidence in Harmon's case was compared to that in the Mihaljevic case. Ross was eliminated as the source of DNA from the Harmon case in 2010. ==See also== *List of solved missing person cases *Murder of Krista Harrison *Robert Anthony Buell ==ReferencesCategory:1980s missing person cases Category:1981 murders in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Deaths by strangulation in the United States Category:Kidnappings in the United States Category:Murdered American children Category:Missing person cases in Ohio Category:Murder in Ohio Category:October 1981 events in the United States Category:Rapes in the United States Category:Victims of serial killers Category:Violence against children ","title":"Murder of Tina Harmon"},{"id":"35862175","text":"Avishk (, also Romanized as Āvīshk and Evīshk; also known as Evick) is a village in Qohestan Rural District, Qohestan District, Darmian County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Whereas there was little attention for Focquenbroch in the nineteenth century, interest in him renewed in the twentieth century. ==Biography== Willem Godschalck van Focquenbroch was born in Amsterdam to Paulus van Focquenbroch, a merchant originally from Antwerp, and Catharina Sweers, the daughter of an Antwerp carpenter. He was baptised on 26 April 1640 in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. Focquenbroch studied medicine at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam.

In a dull first half without many chances, Anderlecht took the lead after 25 minutes when Dennis Praet scored the opening goal. Anderlecht had possession, but was not able to create any chances, while Hamdi Harbaoui almost equalized before half time. Immediately after the break, Jérémy Taravel was wearing the wrong tape around his ankles and asked to change it by the referee, while play continued. Anderlecht used the extra man situation, allowing Dieumerci Mbokani to head in the 2-0. Lokeren coach Peter Maes was furious with Taravel, but could smile again soon after as Ivan Leko lobbed the ball into the Anderlecht goal. On the hour mark, Leko scored the equalizing goal, although Harbaoui had touched the ball with his hands during the play, without being noticed by the referee. Anderlecht then again took control of the match and scored the 3-2 winner 15 minutes from the end through Guillaume Gillet, who shot the ball perfectly into the top corner of the goal. Lokeren was unable to score thereafter, with Anderlecht coming close to a fourth goal as Mbokani hit the post.

Robert Bland Sanderson, born 1825 Slaidburn, and died June 18, 1887 San Angelo, Texas. He was a Senator for the State of Wisconsin as well as one of the Regents of the University of Wisconsin. Robert B. Sanderson (1825 – June 18, 1887) was an American businessman, farmer, rancher and politician from Columbia County, Wisconsin who represented part or all of Columbia County in the Wisconsin State Assembly and the Wisconsin State Senate at various times in the 1860s, before moving to Texas and becoming a prominent businessman in Tom Green County. == Background == He was born in Slaidburn, West Riding of Yorkshire, England in 1825, and moved to the United States at the age of 23, arriving in New York City but moving on to Buffalo, New York, where he went into the slaughtering business for a couple of years. In 1850, he sold out and moved to Wisconsin, and became a farmer and rancher. In 1851, his younger brother Thomas Sanderson left Slaidburn and came to Wisconsin with his wife and children, joining his brother in Columbia County.Jones, J[ames] E., ed. A History of Columbia County, Wisconsin: A Narrative Account of Its Historical Progress, Its People, and Its Principal Interests Volume 2. Chicago and New York: Lewis Publishing Co., 1914; p. 661 In 1856, Robert Sanderson married Mary Currie, daughter of an immigrant from Scotland. From 1858–1860, he was on the town board of Springvale in Columbia County, serving in 1860 as its chairman.The history of Columbia County, Wisconsin, containing an account of its settlement, growth, development and resources; an extensive and minute sketch of its cities, towns and villages—their improvements, industries, manufactories, churches, schools and societies; its war record, biographical sketches, portraits of prominent men and early settlers; the whole preceded by a history of Wisconsin, statistics of the state, and an abstract of its laws and constitution and of the constitution of the United States Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1880; p. 859 His brother Thomas was treasurer of Springvale in 1859. As of 1862, when he first appeared in the Assembly, he was 36 years of age, and had been in Wisconsin for 12 years; he was at that time a resident of Cambria, and a member of the Republican Party. == Legislative service == He was first elected to the Assembly for the 1862 session, representing the 3rd Columbia County district (Courtland, Fort Winnebago, Marcellon, Randolph, Scott, Springvale and Wyocena, succeeding James H. Bonney (also a farmer and a Republican). He was assigned to the standing committee on railroads.Warren, John H.; Dean, John S., eds. The Legislative Manual of the State of Wisconsin. Comprising Jefferson's Manual, the Rules; also lists and tables for reference, with indices First Annual Edition. Madison: Smith and Cullaton, State Printers, 1862; pp. 85, 87, 114 He was succeeded in the 1863 term by Yates Ashley, a fellow Republican. Sanderson (now living in Poynette) returned to the Assembly for the 1866 session, but this time from the 2nd Columbia County district, succeeding Jesse Hand, another farmer and member of the Union Party (the label which the Republicans were using during this era). He was assigned to the committees on the expiration and re-enactment of laws; and on agriculture and manufactures.Stewart, Frank M.; Young, E. W., eds.

Madison: Atwood and Rublee, State Printers, 1867; pp. 155, 168, 169, 204 He returned in 1868, although by that time the Union Party label had been abandoned; he was assigned to the committees on privileges and elections; on agriculture; and on railroads (chairing the latter). He was re-appointed to a new term as a regent, and would serve in that capacity through 1873, including serving on the executive committee of the Board of Regents.The Legislative Manual, of the State of Wisconsin; Comprising Jefferson's Manual, Rules, Forms and Laws, for the Regulation of Business; also, lists and tables for reference Seventh Annual Edition. Madison: Atwood and Rublee, State Printers, 1868; pp. 167, 169–170, 198 He was succeeded in 1869 by fellow Republican William M. Griswold. == After the legislature == By 1870, he had moved to \\"'76 Farm\\" in Dane County four miles outside of Madison, where he raised Clydesdales, shorthorn cattle and other livestock. In 1870, he was the unsuccessful candidate for the 2nd Assembly district of that County against Democrat Knudt Heimdal, with 751 votes to Heidal's 858; but his brother Thomas was elected to Robert's old 2nd Columbia County Assembly seat at that same election.The Legislative Manual of the State of Wisconsin; Comprising Jefferson's Manual, Rules, Forms and Laws for the Regulation of Business; also, lists and tables for reference Tenth Annual Edition.

Bolens, 1875 [Covers 1873/1874] He was also involved in the creation of the Madison and Portage Railway. == Gone to Texas == In 1876 Sanderson sold all his interests in Wisconsin and moved to Texas, whose climate and custom of free range husbandry suited his preferences. After a period as a sheep dealer in San Antonio, he joined his sons in a partnership with J. I. Case (like himself, a former Republican Wisconsin State Senator) and Eli Stilson, raising cattle and sheep. When the partnership dissolved, Case and Stilson took the cattle, and the Sandersons moved to San Angelo, where they continued mostly in the sheep business. When the San Angelo National Bank was organized, Sanderson was elected its president, and held that office until his death on June 18, 1887. He and Mary Currie Sanderson had four sons and two daughters.Cox, James.

HD 33579 lies in a part of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram referred to as the Yellow Evolutionary Void because stars with that combination of luminosity and temperature are extremely unstable. They either expand to become cooler or shed their outer layers completely to become hotter. Yet HD 33579 is relatively stable, hardly even variable. This is thought to be due to its higher mass compared to most stars with similar temperature and luminosity. HD 33579 is an extremely rare type of star currently evolving for the first time through the yellow evolutionary void from being a blue hypergiant to becoming a red hypergiant. This means the star is often referred to as a yellow hypergiant although the spectral type of A3 means it is also described as a white hypergiant. Although HD 33579 has not been formally listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, analysis of Hipparcos photometry confirmed small amplitude variations in its brightness that had been reported in earlier research. Periods of 620 days and 105 days are found, plus other possible shorter periods. The total amplitude is only around 0.1 magnitudes.

Several notable pharmaceutical compounds have a trifluoromethyl group incorporated: fluoxetine, mefloquine, Leflunomide, nulitamide, dutasteride, bicalutamide, aprepitant, celecoxib, fipronil, fluazinam, penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, fluridone, norflurazon, sorafenib and triflurazin. A relevant agrochemical is trifluralin. The development of synthetic methods for adding trifluoromethyl groups to chemical compounds is actively pursued in academic research. ==History== The first to investigate trifluoromethyl groups in relationship to biological activity was F. Lehmann in 1927.Lehmann, F. \\"Chemical constitution and activity. Aromatic fluorine compounds.\\" Arch. exp. Pathol. Pharmakol 130 (1928): 250-255. An early review appeared in 1958. An early synthetic method was developed by Frédéric Swarts in 1892, based on antimony fluoride. In this reaction benzotrichloride was reacted with SbF3 to form PhCF2Cl and PhCF3. In the 1930s Kinetic Chemicals and IG Farben replaced SbF3 with HF. The McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes, iodoaromatic compounds and copper. In 1969 Kobayashi & Kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations. {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\"  McLoughlin-Thrower reaction - McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1968) - } ==ReagentsTrifluoromethyltrimethylsilane=== Preparation of the trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane was reported by Ingo Ruppert in 1984. In 1989, Prakash and Olah first reported activation of TMSCF3 by fluoride to perform nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds. In the same year, Stahly described similar reactions for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated phenols and anilines. Since then TMSCF3 has been widely used as a nucleophilic trifluoromethylating agent. An example is the trifluoromethylation of cyclohexanone in THF using tetrabutylammonium fluoride. {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\"  Cyclohexanol trifluoromethylation - Trifluoromethylation using trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane - } The substrates can be aryl halides. Potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate for this purpose has been synthesised from B(OMe)3, CF3SiMe3 and KF. Aryl functionalization by C-H activation has also been reported. ===Sodium trifluoroacetate=== Sodium trifluoroacetate as a reagent for trifluoromethylations was introduced by Matsui in 1981. In the original scope the substrate was an aromatic halide and the metal salt copper(I)iodide. ===Trifluoromethane=== Fluoroform (CF3H) has been employed as a trifluoromethylation reagent for aldehydes in combination with a strong base {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background- color:white;\\"  Trifluoromethylation fluoroform folleas 1998 - Trifluoromethylation fluoroform folleas 1998 - } ===Trifluoroiodomethane=== Trifluoroiodomethane is a reagent in aromatic coupling reactions. It has also been used with enones, for example with chalcone, a reaction catalysed by diethyl zinc and Wilkinson's catalyst: {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\"  Trifluoromethylation trifluoroiodomethane - Trifluoromethylation using diethyl zinc and Wilkinson's catalyst - } ===Trifluoromethyl sulfone=== Trifluoromethyl sulfone (PhSO2CF3) and trifluoromethyl sulfoxide (PhSOCF3) can be used for trifluoromethylations of electrophiles ===Trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride=== Trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (or triflyl chloride, CF3SO2Cl) can be used in a highly efficient method to introduce a trifluoromethyl group to aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, including known pharmaceuticals such as Lipitor. The chemistry is general and mild, and uses a photoredox catalyst and a light source at room temperature. :Trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes by means of photoredox catalysis ===Sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate=== Sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate (CF3SO2Na) as a trifluoromethylation reagent was introduced by Langlois in 1991. The reaction requires t-butyl hydroperoxide and generally a metal and proceeds through a radical mechanism. The reagent has been applied with heterocyclic substrates {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\"  Trifluorination Langlois reagent 2011 - Trifluorination Langlois reagent 2011 - } === Umemoto reagents === Umemoto reagents are (trifluoromethyl)dibenzoheterocyclic salts. ===Trifluoromethyl-metal reagents=== Many CF3-containing metal complexes have been prepared, and some are useful for trifluoromethylation. The most obvious reagent is CF3Li, which can be generated by lithium-iodide exchange. This compound is however unstable even at low temperatures. It degrades to lithium fluoride and difluorocarbene. Trifluoromethyl copper(I) reagents are more useful. These reagents are generated in situ by reaction of CF3I with copper powder in polar solvents.Donald J. Burton, Long Lu \\"Fluorinated Organometallic Compounds\\" Topics in Current Chemistry, 1997, Vol. 193, p. 45. Hg(CF3)2, prepared by decarboxylation of the trifluoroacetate, has proven useful for the trifluoromethylation of other metals.Reint Eujen \\"Bis(Trifluoromethyl)Mercury\\" 1986, volume 24, p. 52. ==Reaction typesAromatic coupling reactions=== In coupling reactions between aromatic compounds and metal-trifluoromethyl complexes the metal is usually copper, Pd and Ni are less prominent. The reactions are stoichiometric or catalytic. In the McLoughlin-Thrower reaction (1962) iodobenzene reacts with trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) and copper powder in dimethylformamide at 150 °C to trifluoromethylbenzene. The intermediate in this reaction type is a perfluoromethyl-metal complex. A palladium acetate catalysed reaction described in 1982 used zinc powder with the main intermediate believed to be CF3ZnI with Pd(0) is the active catalyst. The first copper catalysed coupling was reported in 2009 and based on an iodoarene, a trifluoromethylsilane, copper iodide and 1,10-phenanthroline. Variations include another CF3 donor potassium (trifluoromethyl)trimethoxyborate, the use of aryl boronic acids or the use of a trifluoromethyl sulfonium salt or the use of a trifluoromethylcopper(I) phenanthroline complex. A catalytic palladium catalysed reaction was reported in 2010 using aryl halides, (trifluoromethyl)triethylsilane and allylpalladium chloride dimer {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background- color:white;font-size:10px;\\" Aromatic trifluoromethylation Kitazume 1982 Aromatic trifluoromethylation Oishi 2009 -  Aromatic trifluoromethylation Kitazume 1982 Aromatic catalytic trifluoromethylation Oishi 2009 - } ===Radical trifluoromethylation=== In radical trifluoromethylation the active species is the trifluoromethyl free radical. Reagents such as bromotrifluoromethane and haloform have been used for this purpose but in response to the Montreal Protocol alternatives such as trifluoroiodomethane have been developed as replacement. One particular combination is CF3I / triethylborane Other reagents that generate the CF3 radical are sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate and bis(trifluoroacetyl) peroxide. {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\" Trifluorododecanone synthesis 1991 - Trifluoromethylation using CF3I and triethylborane. The base is 2,6-lutidine - } In the CF3 radical the fluorine atom is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect but also a weak pi donor through interaction of the fluorine lone pair with the radical center's SOMO. Compared to the methyl radical the CF3 radical is pyramidal (angle 107.8 °C ) with a large inversion barrier, electrophilic and also more reactive. In reaction with styrene it is 440 times more reactive. An early report (1949) describes the photochemical reaction of iodotrifluoromethane with ethylene to 3-iodo-1,1,1-trifluoropropane. Reagents that have been reported for the direct trifluoromethylation of arenes are CF3I, CF3Br (thermal or photochemical), silver trifluoroacetate/TiO2 (photchemical) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate/Cu(OSO2CF3)2/tBuOOH. ===Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation=== In nucleophilic trifluoromethylation the active species is the CF3− anion. It was, however, widely believed that the trifluoromethyl anion is a transient species and thus cannot be isolated or observed in the condensed phase. Contrary to the popular belief, the CF3 anion, with [K(18-crown-6)]+ as a countercation, was produced and characterized by Prakash and coworkers. The challenges associated with observation of CF3 anion are alluded to its strong basic nature and its tendency to form pentacoordinated silicon species, such as [Me3Si(CF3)2]− or [Me3Si(F)(CF3)]−. The reactivity of fluoroform in combination with a strong base such as t-BuOK with carbonyl compounds in DMF is an example. Here CF3− and DMF form an hemiaminolate adduct ([Me2NCH(O)CF3]K). {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\" Trifluoromethylation methyl fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetate - trifluoromethylation using methyl fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetate. The intermediate is CF3Cu - } ===Electrophilic trifluoromethylation=== In electrophilic trifluoromethylation the active trifluoromethyl donor group carries a positive charge. Production of an CF3+ cation has been described as \\"extremely hard\\" The first relevant reagent, a diaryl(trifluoromethyl) sulfonium salt (Ar2S+CF3SbF6−) was developed in 1984 by reaction of an aryltrifluoromethyl sulfoxide 1 with SF3+SbF6− followed by reaction with an electron-rich arene.Yagupolskii, L. M.; Kondratenko, N. V.; Timofeeva, G. N. J. Org. Chem. USSR 1984, 20, 103–106. The reagent was used in trifluoromethylation of a thiophenolate. S-(trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate is a commercially available and known trifluoromethylation reagent based on the same principle first documented in 1990. In this type of compound sulfur has been replaced by oxygen, selenium and tellurium. Examples of substrates that have been investigated are pyridine, aniline, triphenylphosphine and the lithium salt of phenylacetylene. {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background- color:white;\\" +Electrophilic Perfluoroalkylating Agents align=\\"center\\"5-(Trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium trifluoromethanesulfonate align=\\"center\\"5-(Trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate align=\\"center\\"3,3-Dimethyl-1-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-benziodoxole - 5-(Trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium trifluoromethanesulfonate 5-(Trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium tetraborate 3,3-Dimethyl-1-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-benziodoxole - } Another group of trifluoromethyl donors are hypervalent iodine(III)–CF3 reagents for example 3,3-dimethyl-1-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2-benziodoxole. Substrates are thiols, alcohols, phosphines, (hetero) arenes, unactivated olefins and unsaturated carboxylic acids. {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background- color:white;\\"  Togni reagent synth of ethyl-(R)-2-amino-3-(trifluoromethylthio)propanoate hydrochloride - Trifluoromethylation at a thiol group using hypervalent iodine - } The reaction mechanism of electrophilic trifluoromethylations has been described as controversial with polar substitution or single electron transfer as likely candidates. ==Asymmetric trifluoromethylation== In asymmetric trifluoromethylation the trifluoromethyl group is added to the substrate in an enantioselective way. Ruppert's reagent has been used for this purpose in an asymmetric induction approach to functionalise chiral amino acid derivates, saccharides, and steroids. Because Ruppert's reagent requires a tetraalkylammonium fluoride, chiral ammonium fluorides have been employed in asymmetric catalysis. In the field of electrophilic trifluoromethylation an early contribution involved reaction of a metal enolate with a trifluoromethyl chalcogen salt in presence of a chiral boron catalyst {align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"background-color:white;\\" Asymmetic trifluorination Iseki 1994 Asymmetic trifluorination Caron 2003 - Asymmetric trifluoromethylation Iseki 1994 Asymmetric trifluormethylation Caron 2003 -shin } More recent examples of highly enantioselective methods for the α-trifluoromethylation of carbonyls are available through enamine catalysis of aldehydes (photoredox or iodonium), copper catalysis of β-ketoesters, and radical addition to zirconium enolates. ==References== Category:Organic reactions ","title":"Trifluoromethylation"},{"id":"35862388","text":"Kalateh-ye Molla () may refer to: * Kalateh-ye Molla, Gonabad, Razavi Khorasan Province * Kalateh-ye Molla, Zaveh, Razavi Khorasan Province * Kalateh-ye Molla, Damghan, Semnan Province * Kalateh-ye Molla, Meyami, Semnan Province * Kalateh-ye Molla, alternate name of Dehmolla, Semnan Province * Kalateh-ye Molla, South Khorasan ==See also== * Kalateh-ye Molla Aziz * Kalateh-ye Molla Gholamhoseyn * Kalateh-ye Molla Khodadad * Kalateh-ye Molla Mohammad * Kalateh-ye Molla Veys ","title":"Kalateh-ye Molla"},{"id":"35862392","text":"Julian Marshall is a British journalist and radio broadcaster working for the BBC.

Edition Maritim 2009, . in the so-called Hochland (\\"highland\\") area of the island. == Access == Since 1994 the lighthouse, with its 102 steps, has been open to the public. So that it does not become too crowded at the top, only 15 visitors may be admitted at any one time. Visitors must be at least six years old. When wind speeds reach Force 6 or higher, the tower is closed for safety reasons. == Technical details == The lighthouse was built in 1887/1888 of brick construction. It was taken into service on 19 November 1888. It was modified from 1927 to 1929 and fitted with a reinforced-concrete shell. It is 28 metres high and has a focal height of 95 metres above mean sea level in the Baltic Sea. The observation gallery is located at a height of 20 metres. Its light has the following ranges: white 24.9 nautical miles (45 kilometres) and red 21.3 nautical miles (38 kilometres). Its characteristic is Flashing White Red, 2.4 seconds on, 7.6 seconds off. Its light source is a metal-halide lamp. The Stralsund Waterway and Shipping Office has responsible for the servicing and maintenance of the tower since 1990. == Postage stamps == The first postage stamp that depicted Dornbusch Lighthouse appeared on 13 May 1975 and was issued by the Deutsche Post (GDR).

The genus Pediococcus is a spherical cocci shaped bacteria with nonmotile, non spore- forming and homofermentative properties. P. damnosus is a chemo-organotrophic, catalase negative, facultative anaerobe. Strains of this species frequently grow in wine and beer, where they overproduce glucan and spoil products by increasing their viscosity. P. damnosus is a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), that can tolerate the low pH and higher ethanol levels that are found in beer. The ability to grow in beer is a strain specific characteristic of the species P. damnosus.Behr, Jürgen, et al. \\"The Identification of Novel Diagnostic Marker Genes for the Detection of Beer Spoiling Pediococcus damnosus Strains Using the BlAst Diagnostic Gene FindEr\\". PLOS ONE. Pediococcus damnosus LMG 28219 is a lactic acid bacterium that has proved to be capable of growing in beer. ==CharacteristicsGrowth in wine=== Increased viscosity in wines is known as ropiness. Ropiness is a common type of spoilage in wines. Ropy wines have an oily or slimy appearance and higher voscosity due to the production of extracellular polysaccharide glucan. Lactic acid bacteria do not often produce glucan and only a few strains of lactic acid bacteria have been reported to produce glucan. P. damnosus also produces acetic acid and biogenic amines. In alcohol fermentation the presence of acetic acid inhibits the fermentation of ethanol. Increased levels of biogenic amines are correlated to compounds in wine that are indicative of wine spoilage. At increased concentrations, biogenic amines have an enhanced level of toxicity, affecting the hygienic quality of wine. ===Growth conditions for P. damnosus=== P. damnosus has been reported to grow successfully on MRS (CECT 8) medium with 40% beer or wine added to the culture medium with a reported pH of 5.8 and incubated at 26 °C in an anaerobic chamber for 48+ hours. CECT 8 is a growth medium designed to support the growth of lactic acid bacteria. It was designed by de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe in 1960. ==Genome analysisSpoilage identification of P. damnosus=== Identification of spoilage associated diacetyl in strains of P. damnosus can be used to determine the risk of spoilage in the brewery environment. Diacetyl is a plasmid encoded trait that can be identified through diagnostic marker genes(DMG). Diagnostic marker genes are used for the identification of different bacterial groups. BIAst Diagnostic Gene findEr(BADGE) is a tool used to predict DMG's in bacteria. It offers a straightforward procedure to comparative genomics. BADGE is used to successfully identify a DMG called fabZ. fabZ is used to discriminate between strains of P. damnosus capable of growing in beer. ==References Further reading  *Type strain of Pediococcus damnosus at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Lactobacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 1904 ","title":"Pediococcus damnosus"},{"id":"35862474","text":"Stenalia jakli is a beetle in the genus Stenalia of the family Mordellidae.

It is designed to help protect users against attacks that utilize social engineering and drive-by downloads to infect a system by scanning URLs accessed by a user against a blacklist of websites containing known threats. With the Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft placed the SmartScreen settings into the Windows Defender Security Center. ==SmartScreen in Internet ExplorerInternet Explorer 7: Phishing Filter=== SmartScreen was first introduced in Internet Explorer 7 then known as the Phishing Filter. Phishing Filter does not check every website visited by the user, only those that are known to be suspicious. ===Internet Explorer 8: SmartScreen Filter=== With the release of Internet Explorer 8, the Phishing Filter was renamed to SmartScreen and extended to include protection from socially engineered malware. Every website and download is checked against a local list of popular legitimate websites; if the site is not listed, the entire address is sent to Microsoft for further checks. If it has been labeled as an impostor or harmful, Internet Explorer 8 will show a screen prompting that the site is reported harmful and shouldn't be visited. From there the user can either visit their homepage, visit the previous site, or continue to the unsafe page. If a user attempts to download a file from a location reported harmful, then the download is cancelled. The effectiveness of SmartScreen filtering has been reported to be superior to socially engineered malware protection in other browsers. According to Microsoft, the SmartScreen technology used by Internet Explorer 8 was successful against phishing or other malicious sites and in blocking of socially engineered malware. Beginning with Internet Explorer 8, SmartScreen can be enforced using Group Policy. ===Internet Explorer 9: Application Reputation=== Building on top of the SmartScreen Filter introduced in Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9's protection against malware downloads is extended with SmartScreen Application Reputation that detects untrustworthy executables. This warns a person if they are downloading an executable program without a safe reputation, from a site that does not have a safe reputation. ===Internet Explorer Mobile 10=== Internet Explorer Mobile 10 was the first release of Internet Explorer Mobile to support the SmartScreen Filter. ==Windows== SmartScreen filtering at the desktop level, performing reputation checks by default on any file or application downloaded from the Internet, was introduced in Windows 8. Similar to the way SmartScreen works in Internet Explorer 9, if the program does not have an established good reputation, the user is alerted that running the program may harm their computer. When SmartScreen is left at its default settings, the administrator needs to launch and run the program. Microsoft faced concerns surrounding the privacy, legality and effectiveness of the new system, suggesting that the automatic analysis of files (which involves sending a cryptographic hash of the file and the user's IP address to a server) could be used to build a database of users' downloads online, and that the use of the outdated SSL 2.0 protocol for communication could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on the data. In response, Microsoft later issued a statement noting that IP addresses were only being collected as part of the normal operation of the service and would be periodically deleted, that SmartScreen on Windows 8 would only use SSL 3.0 for security reasons, and that information gathered via SmartScreen would not be used for advertising purposes or sold to third parties. ==Outlook.com== Outlook.com uses SmartScreen to protect users from unsolicited e-mail messages (spam), fraudulent emails (phishing) and malware spread via e-mail. After its initial review of the body text, the system focuses on the hyperlinks and attachments. ===Junk mail (spam)=== To filter spam, SmartScreen Filter uses machine learning from Microsoft Research which learns from known spam threats and user feedback when emails are marked as \\"Spam\\" by the user. Over time, these preferences help SmartScreen Filter to distinguish between the characteristics of unwanted and legitimate e-mail and can also determine the reputation of senders by a number of emails having had this checked. Using these algorithms and the reputation of the sender is an SCL rating (Spam Confidence Level score) assigned to each e-mail message (the lower the score, the more desirable). A score of -1, 0, or 1 is considered not spam, and the message is delivered to the recipient's inbox. A score of 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 is considered spam and is delivered to the recipient's Junk Folder. Scores of 5 or 6 are considered to be suspected spam, while a score of 9 is considered certainly spam. The SCL score of an email can be found in the various x-headers of the received email. ===Phishing=== SmartScreen Filter also analyses email messages from fraudulent and suspicious Web links. If such suspicious characteristics are found in an email, the message is either directly sent to the Spam folder with a red information bar at the top of the message which warns of the suspect properties. SmartScreen also protects against spoofed domain names (spoofing) in emails to verify whether an email is sent by the domain which it claims to be sent. For this, it uses the technology Sender ID and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). SmartScreen Filter also ensures that one email from authenticated senders can distinguish more easily by placing a green-shield icon for the subject line of these emails. == In other products == SmartScreen is also included in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server. ==Code Signing Certificates== SmartScreen builds reputation based on code signing certificates that identify the author of the software. This means that once a reputation has been built, new versions of an application can be signed with the same certificate and maintain the same reputation. However, code signing certificates need to be renewed every two years. SmartScreen does not relate a renewed certificate to an expired one. This means that reputations need to be rebuilt every two years, with users getting frightening messages in the meantime. Extended Validation (EV) certificates seem to avoid this issue, but they are expensive and difficult to obtain for small developers. ==Effectiveness== In late 2010, the results of browser malware testing undertaken by NSS Labs were published. The study looked at the browser's capability to prevent users following socially engineered links of a malicious nature and downloading malicious software. It did not test the browser's ability to block malicious web pages or code. According to NSS Labs, Internet Explorer 9 blocked 99% of malware downloads compared to 90% for Internet Explorer 8 that does not have the SmartScreen Application Reputation feature as opposed to the 13% achieved by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari; which all use a Google Safe Browsing malware filter. Opera 11 was found to block just 5% of malware. SmartScreen Filter was also noted for adding legitimate sites to its blocklists almost instantaneously, as opposed to the several hours it took for blocklists to be updated on other browsers. In early 2010, similar tests had given Internet Explorer 8 an 85% passing grade, the 5% improvement being attributed to \\"continued investments in improved data intelligence\\". By comparison, the same research showed that Chrome 6, Firefox 3.6 and Safari 5 scored 6%, 19% and 11%, respectively. Opera 10 scored 0%, failing to \\"detect any of the socially engineered malware samples\\". Manufacturers of other browsers criticized the test, focusing upon the lack of transparency of URLs tested and the lack of consideration of layered security additional to the browser, with Google commenting that \\"The report itself clearly states that it does not evaluate browser security related to vulnerabilities in plug-ins or the browsers themselves\\", and Opera commenting that the results appeared \\"odd that they received no results from our data providers\\" and that \\"social malware protection is not an indicator of overall browser security\\". In July 2010, Microsoft claimed that SmartScreen on Internet Explorer had blocked over a billion attempts to access sites containing security risks. According to Microsoft, the SmartScreen Filter included in Outlook.com blocks 4.5 billion unwanted e-mails daily from reaching users. Microsoft also claims that only 3% of incoming email is junk mail but a test by Cascade Insights says that just under half of all junk mail still arrives in the inbox of users. In a September 2011 blog post, Microsoft stated that 1.5 billion attempted malware attacks and over 150 million attempted phishing attacks have been stopped. ==Criticism== In October 2017, criticisms regarding URL submission methods were addressed with the creation of the Report unsafe site URL submission page. Microsoft now supports URL submissions from this form as opposed to the previous experience of a user having to visit the site and use in-product reporting methods. SmartScreen Filter can be bypassed. Some phishing attacks use a phishing email linking to a front-end URL not in the Microsoft database; clicking this URL in the email redirects the user to the malicious site. The \\"report this website\\" option in Internet Explorer only reports the currently-open page; the front-end URL in the phishing attack cannot be reported to Microsoft and remains accessible. SmartScreen Filter creates a problem for small software vendors when they distribute an updated version of installation or binary files over the internet. Whenever an updated version is released, SmartScreen responds by stating that the file is not commonly downloaded and can therefore install harmful files on your system. This can be fixed by the author digitally signing the distributed software. Reputation is then based not only on a file's hash but on the signing certificate as well. A common distribution method for authors to bypass SmartScreen warnings is to pack their installation program (for example Setup.exe) into a ZIP-archive and distribute it that way, though this can confuse non-expert users. Another criticism is that SmartScreen makes non-commercial/small end software development unaffordable. Developers either have to purchase standard code signing certificates or more expensive extended validation certificates. Extended validation certificates allow the developer to immediately establish reputation with SmartScreen but are often unaffordable for people developing software either for free or not for immediate profit. The standard code signing certicates however pose a \\"catch-22\\" for developers, since SmartScreen warnings make people reluctant to download software, as a consequence to get downloads requires first passing Smartscreen, passing SmartScreen requires getting reputation and getting reputation is dependent on downloads. == See also == * Anti-phishing software * Google Safe Browsing == References  *A detailed FAQ by Microsoft on SmartScreen Filter SmartScreen Category:Computer network security ","title":"Microsoft SmartScreen"},{"id":"35862492","text":"Tre Kronor in November 1958, from the left, standing: Lasse Björn, Karl-Sören \\"Kalle\\" Hedlund, Einar Granath, Sigge Bröms, Nils \\"Double-Nisse\\" Nilsson, Carl-Göran \\"Lill-Stöveln\\" Öberg, Göran Lysén, Uno \\"Garvis\\" Öhrlund, Roland \\"Rolle\\" Stoltz; front row: Sven \\"Tumba\\" Johansson, Hasse Svedberg, Yngve Johansson, Roland \\"Sura-Pelle\\" Pettersson, Vilgot \\"Ville\\" Larsson and Rune Gudmundsson.

Die Photographie 1948. Bildnerische Photographie, Photographik, Bildbericht, Photogramm. held in a still partially destroyed public building in Stuttgart. He gave classes which enabled a group of young photographers to learn and exchange ideas. Peter Keetman, Ludwig Windstosser, Wolfgang Reisewitz and Siegfried Lauterwasser had exhibited in the show, and in 1949 were joined by Toni Schneiders and Otto Steinert and together they established the fotoform group. A shared and passionate interest in a new and unconventional photography suited to their time, required no written manifesto. Otto Steinert was a natural leader who was to become director of the photography programme at the Staatliche Werkkunstschule in Saarbrücken (1954–59) and at the Folkwangschule in Essen (1959–78), and who was also the founder and curator of the photography collection at the Museum Folkwang and a founder of Photokina. It was he who suggested the title fotoform, the name to be purposely be written in lowercase letters, as Steinert did for the subjektive fotografie exhibition title. == Ethos == fotoform was a secession from mainstream, realist post-war photography in West Germany, driven by a desire to reconnect to photographic tendencies of the 1920s and early 1930s, and thus to draw attention to the creative possibilities of photography which had been extinguished by the propagandistic Nazi cultural policy. Otto Steinert asserted that “a new photographic style is one of the demands of our times,”Otto Steinert, Subjektive Fotografie, exhibition catalogue, Staatlische Schule für Kunst und Handwerk Saarbrücken, 1951, p. 5. but also consciously resurrected Bauhaus principles, as exemplified in his X-ray-like photogram Strenges Ballet, Hommage à Oskar Schlemmer of 1949/1950.Stiftung Saarländischer Kulturbesitz, Saarlandmuseum Saarbrücken catalogue no.NI1607 The group's name is a clear reference to its adherence to formalism, obtained through unusual framings or viewpoints, subverting technical aspects of focus and exposure or by manipulation of darkroom processes, while their commitment to 'subjektive' photography is a departure from 'objectivity', and a new direction toward personal expression; as Steinert explained; “subjective photography means humanised, individualised photography and implies the handling of a camera in order to win from the single object the views expressive of its character.”Otto Steinert, Subjektive Fotografie, Bonn, 1952, p. 26. Subjective meant free, personal, non-functional practice. The radical artist Chargesheimer (pseudonym of Karl-Heinz Hargesheimer) having studied graphics and photography at the Cologne Werkschulen (1942–43) and at the Bavarian State Institute for Photography in Munich (1943–44), and pursuing his interest in theatre from 1947 as a freelance photographer for various playhouses in Germany, encountered fotoform and in 1950 participated in their “photo-kino” exhibition in Cologne and also in their legendary exhibitions of “subjektive fotografie” in 1952 and 1954. In 1953 Heinz Hajek-Halke and Christer Christian (the pseudonym of the Swedish photographer Christer Strömholm) joined the group. The photographers of fotoform were concerned with the formed single image and only photographs which had been accepted by all members of the group were validated as fotoform photography. == Style == This group of young photographers, founded in 1949 by Peter Keetman, Otto Steinert, and Ludwig Windstosser was the nucleus of modernism in that country and especially what was called in ‘subjective photography’ to contrast with the ‘new objectivity’ of the pre-war period. Though it focused on abstraction, design, and close observation, it also fostered new approaches to photo-documentary imagery. By concentrating on details, by cropping, by using sharp contrasts and by choosing extreme perspectives the photographers of the fotoform group concentrated on the graphical properties of black and white photography, often taking their experiments so far as to create almost abstract images. Their artistic strategies included photomontage, photograms, solarisation, negative printing and luminograms among others. == Prominence == In 1950, the fotoform group had its first spectacular appearance at the Photokina (then called Photo-Kino). Already in 1951, fotoform member Otto Steinert included works by all fotoform photographers in his exhibition subjektive fotografie in Saarbrücken, Germany. Under this title the German avant-garde photography of the 1950s reconnected to international trends in international photography. == Exhibitions == * fotoform, Photo-Kino Ausstellung, Cologne, Germany 1950 * fotoform, Circolo fotografico Milanese, Milan, Italy 1950 * 10e Internationale tentonstelling van fotokunst, Focus Salon, Amsterdam, Netherlands 1950 * III.

He was the son of Simon Marie (1775–1855) an infantry captain in Napoleon's Grande Armée from a modest background, and Henriette Josephine de Ficquelmont (1780–1843), poor, but from the nobility of Lorraine.Maurice Wolff, Le roman de Clotilde de Vaux et de Auguste Comte, Perrin, 1929, page 4. The financial situation of his father, retired Captain Marie, was dire for a household with a wife and three children: Clotilde (born in 1815), Maximilian (born in 1819) and Leon (born in 1820) therefore, his father was given an office of tax collector in Meru in Oise To help him.Charles de Rouvre, L'amoureuse histoire d'Auguste comte et de Clotilde de Vaux, Calmann-Lévy, 1920. Maximilian spent his childhood in Méru with his older sister Mary and his younger brother Leon. He graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1838 and went on to attend the École d'application de l'artillerie et du génie in Metz as an officer student in artillery. While an officer in training in Metz, he discovered a key element of solid mechanics as he found out how solid matters are moving. Ecole Polytechnique's historic entrance In 1841, he was made a lieutenant-major, but, more attracted by the field of mathematics, he chose to resign from the army and move back to Paris. Close to the positivist movements, Ficquelmont began to spend time with his former professor philosopher Auguste Comte, who soon became his mentor.Henri Gouhier, La vie d'Auguste Comte (1931, rééd. 1997), libr. phil. Vrin, Coll. bibl. des textes Phil In 1844, Maximilien Marie introduced him to his sister Clotilde de Vaux. Comte fell passionately in love with her, a feeling that she did not reciprocate,André Thérive, Clotilde de Vaux ou La déesse morte, Albin Michel, 1957 and the one-sided affair ended when Clotilde suddenly died of tuberculosis a year later. Following Clotilde's death in 1846, Maximilien Marie and Comte grow apart while Comte dedicated himself to reorganising his previous philosophical system into a new positivist secular religion inspired by Clotilde's moral values:Auguste Comte, Système de politique positive (1851–1854) the Positivist Church or Religion of Humanity. In 1862, backed by the famous mathematicians Joseph Liouville and General Jean-Victor Poncelet, Maximilien Marie was appointed professor of Mechanics at the École Polytechnique. In 1875, he was appointed head of admissions . Besides his academic achievements at the Polytechnique, he wrote the book Théorie des fonctions de variables imaginaires relating to the Imaginary unit.Théorie des fonctions de variables imaginaires, tomes I à III, Gauthier-Villars, 1874–1876, 3 vol. Growing old, he entered politics during the Third Republic and became mayor of Châtillon. In 1890, he retired from the Polytechnique and died a year later. == Honors == Maximilien Marie was made chevalier (1876) and officer (12 juillet 1880), of the Légion d’honneur. == Works == He published a 12-volume encyclopedia, History of the Mathematics,Maximilien Marie, Histoire des sciences mathématiques et physiques (volume 3 : de Viète à Descartes), 1884 which was divided into two parts: Théorie des fonctions de variables imaginaires (tomes I à III, Gauthier-Villars, 1874–1876, 3 vol.) and Histoire des sciences mathématiques et physiques (tomes I à XII, Gauthier-Villars, 1883–1888, 12 vol.) == Family == Maximilien's sister, Clotilde de Vaux He had one elder sister, the famous positivist muse Clotilde de Vaux, and one younger brother,Léonard Marie (1820–1860), chevalier of the Légion d'honneur, who was also a military officer trained at the École Polytechnique and who died without issue at the Battle of Palikao.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 13, 2012. The episode plot mainly revolves around Stan trying to stop his fourteen-year-old son, Steve from playing with toys. The title and Steve's fantasy parodies Toy Story. This episode was written by Matt Fusfeld and Alex Cuthbertson and directed by Tim Parsons and Jennifer Graves. This episode generally received positive reviews. Kevin McFarland from The A.V. Club rated this episode a B-. ==Plot== Stan gets tired of Steve's playing and insists that it is time he becomes an adult. Stan hatches a plot to get rid of Steve's toys but Steve overhears and thwarts Stan's plan. When Klaus suggests that Steve will lose interest in toys after he loses his virginity, Stan decides to take Steve to Mexico to have sex with a prostitute. On the way, Stan becomes annoyed when he discovers Steve has brought one of his toys. When they arrive at the brothel, Steve declines intercourse. Stan also finds his car's tires have been stolen. Getting a ride, they find that their chauffeurs are a drug cartel and are kidnapped. Stan becomes despondent in captivity, but Steve improvises a toy to make Stan eat and keep his strength up. Stan eventually joins Steve's fantasy and regains hope. When Steve sees his kidnappers are also suffering, he invites them into his fantasy, managing to trap them in the cell while he and Stan escape. Impressed by his son's resilience, Stan realizes Steve uses make—believe to escape the harshness of reality and grudgingly accepts the need for play. As they throw away the makeshift toy, a cockroach named Pedro, it complains about being abandoned. Meanwhile, Francine falls at the store and gets free steaks. Roger offers to get some wine but finds he is out and goes out, crashing his car in the process. Arriving at the wine store, he finds the bottle he wants has been sold to Greg and Terry. He goes to see them about getting the wine but they refuse to let go of it. Roger continues to try but fails. Frustrated, Francine goes over and helps herself to the wine but when she opens the bottle she is knocked through the wall by one of Roger's traps allowing Roger to take both steaks. ==Reception== \\"Toy Whorey\\" first aired on May 13, 2012 in the United States as part of the animated television night on Fox. Like most of the season, the episode was last in the animation television line-up. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show.This episode was watched by 4.13 million U.S. viewers, with a 2.0/5 rating share in the 18-49 demographic group. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- saying: \\"'Toy Whorey' isn't intended as a finale due to the nature of animation production cycles, but it's a lesser version of other episodes this season. 'Wheels & The Legman And The Case Of Grandpa's Key' more effectively used whimsical fantasy; 'The Scarlett Getter' used every character and had a great guest star, and the aforementioned 'Virtual In-Stanity' was a more emotionally affecting father/son plot with bigger laughs.\\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review saying: \\"What Stan couldn't realize until the end of their adventures, was that while Steve still enjoyed using his imagination and playing with toys, he was not necessarily immature. Steve is interested in girls, he's got friends, and he's got hobbies. Still, in keeping with the typical American Dad structure for plots that revolve around Stan, he was incapable of realizing these things until he had put everyone through hell so he could learn that lesson on his own terms.\\" == References Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American Dad!

Volume I of the dictionary went to print in 1815, 1822 and 1823 followed by Volumes II and III in 1820 and 1822 respectively. According to Morrison writing in the preface to Volume I of the dictionary, Thoms had to work largely alone, serving as compositor, pressman, reader and corrector, \\"aided only by Natives who understood not the English language. \\" Thom's received a salary of 1,250 dollars (£300) per annum from the East India Company. p. 327 Over time, the fonts he created for Morrison's dictionary grew in numbers and variety and were used to print over twenty dictionaries and other works designed as Chinese learning aids until they were destroyed by fire in 1856. p. 603 ===Ancient Chinese vases=== While in China, Thom developed an interest in ancient Chinese vases and began work on a book that would trace their development through the various dynasties of ancient Chinese history alongside \\"improvements in the written character during the same period\\".Thoms 1851, p.8 However, having completed the printing of Morrison's dictionary, he returned to England in March 1825 where he was unable to continue with his researches \\"from the want of the assistance of educated natives.\\" In the 1830s he had his own printing shop at 12 Warwick Square, London.Brown, Philip A. H. (1982) London Publishers and Printers c.1800-1870. London: British Library. , p. 201. Sometime later Thoms met a native of Canton named A-lae, which enabled him to produce a short work on vases of the Shang Dynasty dating from 1743 to 1496 BC. The illustrations and descriptions in the book followed an ancient Chinese work entitled the Bógǔ Tú (博古圖), which comprised sixteen large Chinese volumes.Thoms 1851, p. 3 Woodcut engravings from the book produced by A-lae were exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851 held at Hyde Park, London.Thoms 1851, p. 8 The Chinese Repository in its review of the book noted: > \\"This is a very pretty addition to our books on China, and besides having > the minor merit of being an elegant specimen of printing, will also be > prized by the sinologue as a valuable treatise on a little known subjectThe > Chinese Repository (1850) Volume 20, p. 480.\\" ===First Opium War=== During the First Opium War (18391842), at the behest of British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot, Thom acted as translator to Major General Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough at the Second Battle of Canton in May 1841. ===Other activities=== Thoms also translated Chinese poetry and contributed to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1849 he printed A Vocabulary Containing Chinese Words and Phrases Peculiar to Canton and Macau and to the Trade of those Places written by John Francis Davis, former British Superintendent of Trade in China and governor and commander-in-chief of the colony of Hong Kong until 1848. ==Death== Thoms died in December 1855 in Clerkenwell, London, aged 63.England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1837-1915England & Wales, Non-Conformist and Non-Parochial Registers, 1567-1970 ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:British sinologists Category:British expatriates in China Category:English printers Category:1791 births Category:1855 deaths Category:People from Exeter ","title":"Peter Perring Thoms"},{"id":"35862936","text":"Louis Hippolyte Joseph de Mauris, Vicomte de Malartic (1769–1832) was a French aristocrat and military officer who served in the French Army as well as in the United States Army in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. ==Early life and career== He was born on 1 March 1769; he attended the French Military School at the age of 14. He graduated in 1784 and was commissioned a sub- lieutenant. He joined the French Guards as an ensign, and in 1789 transferred to the artillery company in that unit. ==Military campaigns in United States== As the French Revolution unfolded, he left France in 1790 following the disbanding of the French Guards for the United States.Edouard Laboylaye to John M. Newton, 26 February 1874, printed in The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, (Historical Society of Pennsylvania) No. 42 (1918), pp. 181-182. Once there he moved to Gallipolis, a frontier settlement in Ohio. He participated in two military campaigns against the Indian tribes of the Northwest Frontier during his time on the frontier. In 1791, Malartic served as the aide-de-camp for Major General Arthur St. Clair in his operation against the Indians of the Northwest Frontier that culminated in the disastrous battle at the Wabash river known as St. Clair's Defeat and the destruction of the U.S. Army. Malartic himself was wounded at the battle. ==Return to France== After his recovery, he returned to France to join the military forces attempting to restore the monarchy. He remained in military service to the pretender in exile during the Revolution, serving as well in Prussian and Austrian service, eventually rising to become field marshal in 1799 under Louis XVIII. He returned to France in 1814, and remained in military service until 1830, when, unwilling to support Louis Philippe I after the July Revolution, he resigned.Eduard Laboylayle to John M.
