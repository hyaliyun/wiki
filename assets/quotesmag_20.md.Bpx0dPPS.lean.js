He has had previous loan spells with Hellas Verona in Italy, Slovan Liberec in the Czech Republic and Scottish club Motherwell, and in England with Sheffield Wednesday and Wycombe Wanderers. Born in Jamaica, he has represented England at under-20 international level. == Club career  Newcastle United === Aarons joined Newcastle United in 2012 after being released by his home town club Bristol City. He made his reserve team debut on 8 February 2013 against Stoke City and scored in his second reserve game against Crystal Palace 17 days later. Aarons travelled with the Newcastle squad to their game against Fulham. He was not included in the matchday squad as the Magpies lost 1–0. Reserves teammate Ľubomír Šatka also travelled with the squad for the first time. On 1 April 2014, Aarons signed a professional contract with Newcastle United. 2014–15 season Aarons had an impressive pre-season prior to the 2014–15 season, scoring one goal and creating one assist in the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup against Bundesliga team Schalke. Shortly after, he was allocated the number 16 shirt. On 17 August 2014, he made his Premier League debut in their first match of the campaign, replacing Yoan Gouffran for the final 16 minutes of a 2–0 home defeat to Manchester City. He scored his first senior goal in the 3–3 draw with Crystal Palace on 30 August. He also set up teammate Mike Williamson for Newcastle's third goal in the same match, striking the post with his own effort. His contribution to the match described by The Guardian as \\"thrillingly incisive\\". Aarons came back from England U20 duty with a hamstring injury; scans in mid-September determined that it would take around six weeks for the injury to heal. On 29 October, Aarons returned from injury to score his second goal for the club in the fourth round of the League Cup, opening the scoring in Newcastle's 2–0 away victory over holders Manchester City. In early November, Aarons suffered a recurrence of his hamstring injury, ruling him out for another month. Loans In 2018, Aarons spent time out on loan with Hellas Verona under Fabio Pecchia, Benítez's former assistant at Newcastle, and Slovan Liberec. After 13 appearances in all competitions for the Czech side, he returned to Newcastle in December 2018. On 31 January 2019, deadline day for the winter transfer window, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season. Aarons signed for Wycombe Wanderers on 2 September 2019 on a short-term loan. The loan spell came to an end on 12 January 2020. On 31 January 2020, Aarons moved on loan to Scottish Premiership club Motherwell for the remainder of the season. But on 31 May 2020 Aarons's loan spell ended with the Scottish outfit. == International career == Aarons is eligible to represent either England or Jamaica at international level. In August 2014, he received his first call-up to the England U20 team, marking his debut with the opening goal in a 6–0 friendly match win over Romania on 5 September. His club manager Alan Pardew confirmed that, despite interest from Jamaica, Aarons intended to pursue an international future within the England set-up. == Style of play == Aarons operates on the outside of midfield or as a winger, usually on the left side. He is left-footed and known for his injections of pace and technical ability. He has been compared to Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling in his playing style and in his descent; both are Jamaican-born English players. ==Personal life== Aarons was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and migrated to England at the age of 5 to join his mother who was already living in Bristol. He is the cousin of Norwich City player Max Aarons. == Career statistics == {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" +Club statistics - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Domestic Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"7\\"Newcastle United 2014–15 rowspan=\\"2\\"Premier League 410021colspan=\\"2\\"—62 - 2015–16 1010010colspan=\\"2\\"—111 - 2016–17 Championship 400010colspan=\\"2\\"—50 - 2017–18 rowspan=\\"3\\"Premier League 400011colspan=\\"2\\"—51 - 2018–19 000000colspan=\\"2\\"—00 - 2019–20 000000colspan=\\"2\\"—00 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !222005200274 - Hellas Verona (loan) 2017–18 Serie A 11000colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—110 - Slovan Liberec (loan) 2018–19 First League 12010colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—130 - Sheffield Wednesday (loan) 2018–19 Championship 910000colspan=\\"2\\"—00 - Wycombe Wanderers (loan) 2019–20 League One 101100021132 - Motherwell (loan) 2019–20 Scottish Premiership 602100colspan=\\"2\\"—81 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !70!!4!!4!!1!!5!!2!!2!!1!!81!!8 } ==References * Newcastle United F.C. profile * Rolando Aarons profile at the Football Association * * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Hellas Verona F.C. players Category:FC Slovan Liberec players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Motherwell F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Serie A players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Sportspeople from Kingston, Jamaica Category:English people of Jamaican descent Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:England youth international footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in the Czech Republic Category:Black English sportspeople ","title":"Rolando Aarons"},{"id":"35955397","text":"Sir Walter Covert (c. 1544 – 27 January 1632) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons several times during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

He married (2nd) Alice _____. *Reginald de Paveley, Knt. (born about 1293, died 1347), of Westbury and Brook (in Westbury), Wiltshire, Sheriff of Wiltshire, 1335–6, younger son. He married (2nd) by license dated 22 June 1333 Alice Wallis (died 1346), widow of John de Saint John, Knt. (died 1329), 1st Lord Saint John of Lageham. His relative appears to have been Sir Walter Paveley (1319–1375) Knight of the Garter, of Kent, a Knight Founder of the Order of the Garter and the son of Sir Walter Paveley (died 1327) of Kent, by his wife and Maud Burghersh (1304 – c. 1366), daughter and heiress of Sir Stephen Burghersh (died 1310), the elder son of Robert Burghersh (died 1306). *John de Paveley, who married Agnes de la Mare,Woodger, L.

Cheyne had married Joan Paveley in 1368, after the Paveley estates had been divided between Joan and her sister Alice, and he deemed Joan's share to have been inadequate. He thus obtained the making of a second partition which was more favourable to his wife and by which he gained moieties of the hundred of Westbury and the manor of Brooke, a half-share of the profits of the view of frankpledge and the market and fair at Westbury, the hamlets of Ditteridge and Hawkeridge and £6 of yearly rent from the manor of Westbury.Woodger ===Cheney=== Arms of Cheney: Gules, four fusils in fess argent on each an escallop sable The Cheney family (alias Cheyney, Cheyne, etc.) Latinized to de Caineto, possibly from the French chêne, an oak- tree, was an ancient family, branches of which were scattered throughout southern England, from Kent to Cornwall, and in the Midlands.

A common image in these windows was the heraldic badge of a rudder, which was noted earlier by John Leland (1503–1552) when he visited Brook. Sir Ralph Cheney's heraldic badge was a rudder, as is visible sculpted on his monument in Edington Priory Church, but had apparently first been adopted by his ancestors the Paveley family of Brook. Aubrey stated concerning his visit to Brook Hall: \\"Mr Wadman would persuade me that this rudder belonged to the Paveleys who had this place here\\".Aubrey, John.

Jackson, pp.403-4 They were also formerly visible in the church of \\"Seend\\".Aubrey, ed. Jackson, editor's note, p.400, footnote 1 ===Verney=== While the title Baron Willoughby de Broke survives today held by the Verney family formerly of Compton Verney in Warwickshire, the family's connection with Brook faded away in the 17th century after which Brook Hall went into a long decline and for most of its subsequent history was a tenanted farm. Willoughby de Broke was one of Henry the Seventh's best friends. ==20th century== In 1968, three related buildings were recorded on the National Heritage List for England. The Early Wing, from the 15th century, was designated as Grade I while the adjoining farmhouse (c. 1600) and a barn (late 17th century) are Grade II. For 20 years the Early Wing was listed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register. Following many years with shoring scaffolding for structural support following local authority statutory powers enforcement, following a change of ownership in 2014 the hall was subject to repairs in 2017/18 and was described as a success story for the register. ==DescriptionsDescription by John Leland (1503-1552)=== Brook House is described by the antiquarian John Leland (1503–1552), which text was commented on in an article called \\"Leland's Journey through Wiltshire\\" published in the Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine, 1883. Part of the old House of the Paveleys was visible when Leland visited. His description is as follows:Quoted in Rogers, Strife of the Roses :\\"There was of very aunciente tyme an olde maner place wher Brooke Hall is now, and parte of it yet appearithe, but the buyldynge that is there is of the erectynge of the Lorde Stewarde unto Kynge Henry the VII. The wyndowes be full of rudders. Peradventure it was his badge or token of the Amiraltye. There is a fayre parke, but no great large thynge. In it be a great nombar of very fair and fyne greyned okes apt to sele howses. The broke that renithe by Brooke is properly caulyd Bisse, and risethe at a place namyd Bismouth, a two myles above Brooke village, an hamlet longynge to Westbyry paroche. Thens it cummithe onto Brooke village, and so a myle lower onto Brooke Haule, levinge it hard on the right ripe, and about a two miles lower it goith to Trougbridge, and then into Avon\\" ===Description by Aubrey (1626–1697)=== The Antiquarian John Aubrey (1626–1697) visited Brook Hall and in his 1650 work on South Wiltshire wrote describing it as \\"a very great and stately old howse\\" with \\"a hall which is great and open, with very olde windowes\\". There was a \\"canopie chamber\\", a dining room, parlour and chapel, and the windows were filled with coats shewing the armorial descent of Willoughby, which he described. The windows \\"are most of them semée with rudder of a ship, or. He observes \\"the Rudder everywhere\\".Quoted by Rogers This was the heraldic badge of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, apparently inherited from Cheney, as it is shown also on the monument to Sir Ralph Cheyne (died 1400) of Brook, in Edington Priory Church. Aubrey wrote as follows, describing the coats of arms then visible in the stained glass windows of the Great Hall and the \\"Canopie Chamber\\":pp.399-400 :\\"Brook House in Westbury parish is a very great and stately old howse.

Such relations have become increasingly important. == Trade == Between 2000–2009, trade between China and Latin America increased by 1,200% from $10 to $130 billion.Katherine Koleski. Backgrounder: China in Latin America. May 27, 2011. U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission. According to the Chinese Trade Ministry Counselor Yu Zhong, in 2011 the value of trade increased to $241.5 billion, making China the second largest trading partner of Latin America (the USA is the largest). The top five nations in this Sino-Latin trade were Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela and Argentina.China's trade with Latin America grew in 2011, Indo Asian News Service, Wed 18 Apr, 2012, http://in.news.yahoo.com/chinas-trade- latin-america-grew-2011-050334275.html In 2009 7% of Latin America's exports was to China. It consisted largely of raw material and commodities such as copper, iron ore, oil, and soybeans. China was the largest export market for Brazil, Chile, and Peru and the second largest for Argentina, Costa Rica, and Cuba. Four nations contributed 90% of the exports: Brazil (41%), Chile (23.1%), Argentina (15.9%), and Peru (9.3%). Increased Chinese demand has also been argued to increase the commodity prices of Latin American exports. In the case of Brazil the rise of a new middle class has even been seen as due to Chinese commodity demand.Jordi Zamora. China's double-edged trade with Latin America. Sep 3, 2011. AFP. https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggNqQ5G8UFErmAEw71Y-u51P8_Eg?docId=CNG.e829052752a5436e909ab280ad561af6.671 On the other hand, a large part of the exports of Costa Rica (which has a Free Trade Agreement with China), El Salvador, and Mexico to China were high-tech manufactured goods.Ryan Berger. The Fast Ramp-Up. Quarterly Americas. http://www.americasquarterly.org/charticle_winter2012.html 5% of China's exports went to Latin America in 2009 and consisted mainly of industrial and manufactured goods. Chinese goods are popular in part due to their low costs. Chinese manufacturers are also making substantial efforts to establish themselves as brand names for the new middle class. China is investing in power plants in Brazil, and repairing a railway in Argentina. According to a 2012 Fitch ratings report, in 2010, 92% of Latin American exports to China were commodities; 85% of Chinese foreign direct investment went to extractive industries as did 60% of Chinese loans. The report stated that the effects are mixed but overall Latin America has benefited from the relationship with China by higher commodity prices, increased growth, increased investment, and improved governmental financials.Fitch: China's Economic Rise Provides Mixed Benefits for Latin America, May 9, 2012, http://newamericamedia.org/2011/01/latin-america-divided-over-ties-with-china- growing-suspicions-over-chinese-presence-in-latin-america.php , Fitch Ratings, BUSINESS WIRE There are also concerns of environmental impacts related to the huge increase in extractive industries and agriculture by Chinese companies in Latin America, including pollution, deforestation, habitat destruction and rising fossil-fuel emissions. There have been concerns regarding the relationship due to Latin American dependency on exports of low-value added, highly price volatile commodities that employ relatively few people. Latin American manufacturers have faced increasing competition from China on both domestic and international markets. In some countries there have protests against the raising inflow of Chinese manufactured goods, local Chinese businesses, and perceived loss of manufacturing jobs to China. The book The Dragon in the Room: China and the Future of Latin America found that 92% manufacturing exports from Latin American were in sectors where China was increasing its market share while Latin America was decreasing its share, or where both China and Latin America where increasing their shares but Latin America at a slower rate.Kevin P. Gallagher and Roberto Porzecanski. The Dragon in the Room: China and the Future of Latin American Industrialization. 2010. Stanford University Press Several experts have even argued that the long-term outlooks for Latin American manufacturing are poor and other sources for growth and trade such as services should be sought. After the 2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence many Chinese investment projects in Latin America were canceled or have slowed. These include the Nicaragua Canal. == Political == China has been seen as an alternative to the United States and Europe by Latin American nations for support in the international community, for funding of infrastructure and humanitarian aid, and for creating economic growth. The number of high-level meetings between Chinese and Latin American officials have rapidly increased. These have been accompanied by several bilateral agreements. The creation of the BRICS group also helped to increase relations between China and Brazil. WikiLeaks diplomatic cables describe a divided Latin American opinion regarding China. Neil Dávila, head of Mexico's federal agency for promoting foreign commerce and investments, stated \\"We do not want to be China's next Africa,\\" reflecting a common concern regarding the effects of Chinese involvement in Africa. Colombia, Brazil, and Chile also expressed concerns while Venezuela and Argentina were convinced that dependency on the United States must end and saw China as the greatest opportunity for their exports. Chinese officials in response has accused US diplomats of spreading mistrust and Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping in 2009 in Mexico stated that \\"China does not export revolution. China exports neither hunger nor poverty. We do not cause problems. What more can be said of us?\\"Louis E.V. Nevaer, \\"Latin America Divided Over Ties with China,\\" Jan 26, 2011, New American Media, http://newamericamedia.org/2011/01/latin-america- divided-over-ties-with-china-growing-suspicions-over-chinese-presence-in- latin-america.php Many of the nations that continue to have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan are in Central America and the Caribbean. Taiwan has previously offered military exchanges and training as well as economic aid in return but has more recently had difficulty competing with China's economic incentives and in 2008 officially abandoned this \\"checkbook diplomacy\\". The remaining pro-Taiwan nations have been seen as waiting for better Chinese offers. The formation of Community of Latin American and Caribbean States was warmly welcome by China in 2011. Hugo Chavez read aloud a letter from China's Paramount leader Hu Jintao congratulating the leaders on forming the new regional bloc. On January 8, 2015, the 1st China-CELAC Forum opened at the Great Hall of the People in China. In January 2019, numerous countries including the US recognized the legitimacy of opposition leader Juan Guaido as President of Venezuela. The PRC issued an official statement condemning American intervention in the internal affairs of Venezuela, supporting Nicolás Maduro in the struggle for the Venezuelan presidency. == Military == Military relationships have been mainly through military-to- military contacts. In particular Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, and Cuba have had frequent official military visits, exchange of military officers, and navy port calls. South American countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Argentina are buying Chinese weapons. Chile, Ecuador and Peru were visited by a Chinese flotilla in 2009. In 2011 China and Bolivia signed a military-to- military cooperation agreement. In 2015, China's Paramount leader Xi Jinping and President of Argentine, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced prospective arms sales and defense cooperation agreements extending beyond the scope of any made between China and a Latin American nation to date. These plans include Argentina’s purchase or coproduction of 110 8×8 VN-1 APCs, 14 JF-17/FC-1 multirole fighters, and five P18 Malvinas class patrol ships. While the government of President Mauricio Macri, elected in December 2015, soon dropped the arms purchases from China. that also authorizes construction of satellite tracking facility near Las Lajas, Neuquén; base is managed by People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force. Per Argentinian ambassador to China, Diego Guelar, China has agreed to use the base only for civilian purposes. In King George Island, Antarctica, China and Chile share side-by- side military facilities. In 1982, with Pinochet's Chile allowed, China built a Great Wall research station in the Antarctic inside Chile's territorial claims. == Space == China has launched communication satellites (from launch sites in China) for Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Argentina. == Regional organizations == In 2004 China joined the Organization of American States as a permanent observer. In 2008 China joined the Inter-American Development Bank as a donor.

Most baronies had a water mill which was under the control of the laird or lord and to which the tenants were thirled or obliged to go to have their grain ground into flour. A proportion of the grain was taken as payment. Thirlage ended in the late 18th century and resulted in a number of mills being abandoned once market forces took a hold. Kersland Mill on the Powgree Burn lies just downstream of the Tianna Falls in the Kersland Glen and is recorded on Timothy Pont's map c. 1604.

The motto was \\"Praise God\\". The coat of arms were displayed at Dalry church. A local tradition suggests that two sons of Kersland were found guilty of, or at least being involved in the slaughter of a Laird of the Blair; they at first took refuge in England, but afterwards settled on the Border.

He is best known as the host of Restaurant Stakeout, a reality television show on the Food Network. ==Early life== Degel was born and grew up in Queens, New York. He is the youngest of four brothers. ==Criminal record== At the age of 23, Degel and a friend, Austin Offen, reportedly harassed employees at a White Castle on Northern Blvd. in Bayside, Queens. An off-duty police officer, Edwin Buskirk, and a security guard attempted to intervene. Degel held back the security guard while Offen battered Buskirk. Officer Buskirk suffered fractures to his nose and his left eye socket. Offen and Degel were arrested, indicted for assault, and pleaded guilty to reduced charges: Offen to attempted assault, a felony, and Degel to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. Offen received five years' probation and Degel got a conditional discharge. Officer Buskirk required facial surgery. At the age of 27, Degel was convicted of credit card fraud. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released after six months after a plea deal. His witness testimony against his co-conspirators helped the government prosecution leading to their incarceration, including Gambino crime family mobster Louis Ferrante. In 2005, he was named one of Crain's \\"40 under 40\\" entrepreneurs in New York City. ==Career and television== Degel opened his first restaurant, Hollywood and Main, in June 1990 in Flushing, Queens. Six years later he created Uncle Jack's Steakhouse. Today, he owns three locations in New York City. As of March 12, 2012, Degel stars in his own show entitled Restaurant Stakeout. For the series, he goes behind the scenes of different restaurants across the country with hidden cameras to examine their service problems. He is also the author of \\"Inside the Mind of a Serial Entrepreneur\\", published by HarperCollins in May 2012. Degel appeared in the 2nd episode of Breakthrough with Anthony Robbins. Restaurant Stakeout has completed its fifth season. ==References * Official website * Uncle Jack's Steakhouse website Category:American chief executives of food industry companies Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:People from Queens, New York Category:American criminals Category:American mobsters Category:20th- century American businesspeople ","title":"Willie Degel"},{"id":"35955618","text":" The Cessna Citation Longitude (Model 700) is a range business jet, part of the Cessna Citation family. Announced at the May 2012 EBACE, it made its first flight on October 8, 2016, with certification obtained in September 2019. Powered by Honeywell HTF7000 turbofans, The aluminum airframe has the fuselage cross-section of the Citation Latitude, stretched by a seat row, with a new ~28° swept wing and a T-tail. ==Design== The project is perceived as the follow-on development to the now-canceled Cessna Citation Columbus. Its fuselage cross-section (83.25 inch circular section) is the same as the Cessna Citation Latitude. The aircraft has a T-tail empennage and area rule fuselage contouring. The aluminum wings incorporate moderate winglets. Construction is aluminum for both wing and fuselage. The cabin is 7 inches shorter and 6 inches narrower than the Columbus design. Initially, the Snecma Silvercrest engine was selected to power the aircraft, however the production model is powered by Honeywell HTF7000 turbofans. The Silvercrest was planned for the larger Citation Hemisphere, but Textron suspended its development in July 2019 as the turbofan did not meet objectives. Its wings and empennage are similar to the Hawker 4000 with winglets leading to a 5.3 ft. larger wingspan. The moderately super-critical wing have a quarter-chord sweep of 26.8° for its inner section and 28.6° for the outer section. The six-passenger Latitude fuselage has been reinforced and stretched by another row of seats to accommodate eight people in double club. The manufacturer has not announced the final design weights (as of May 2016); BCA estimates a 24,000–25,000 lb. basic operating weight. Cabin height is 6.0 ft., width is 6 ft. 5 in., floor width is 4 ft. 1 in and cabin length is 25 ft. After a takeoff at below the MTOW, the climb rate is at FL200. At its Mach 0.83, TAS max cruise, fuel flow per side is per hour at FL430 and ISA -4. ==Development== Announced at the May 2012 EBACE and scheduled for introduction in 2017. The first flight-test aircraft completed its first flight on October 8, 2016. The second flew in November, and in March 2017 the third, used to develop avionics and systems and to collect flight simulator data before two others will join the test program. The two aircraft completed 125 flights for more than 250 hours as production of the aircraft commenced at Textron Aviation's Wichita, Kansas facility. Less than eight months after the first flight and after more than 200 missions for nearly 400 hours, on track for certification later in 2017, the fourth prototype joined the flight-test program on May 6, fully outfitted for interior, environmental control system, pressurization and cabin technologies evaluation. The first production unit was rolled out on June 13, 2017 as the four test aircraft have flown 550 hours and a fifth aircraft will join in summer 2017. In October 2017, test aircraft have completed more than 1,200 flight hours over 600 flights, for a certification expected by the end of 2017 or in early 2018. In February 2018, as the five aircraft accumulated over 1,000 flights and 2,000 hours, US approval and customer deliveries were expected before the end of the second quarter before European validation six months later. After 3,000 hours on five aircraft, flight testing will conclude by early June 2018, and 200,000 pages of documentation will be completed after a month. As testing has doubled for certification, expanding related documentation, it is expected in the third quarter of 2018 with deliveries from late in this quarter or early in the fourth, less than a year after originally planned. It received a partial exemption for fuel tank flammability requirements applicable through January 2020 to keep its third-quarter approval goal, but a compliance plan had to be submitted by October 1, 2018. On October 15, 2018, fractional operator NetJets announced the purchase of up to 175 Longitudes, sold for $26 million each, along 150 Citation Hemispheres, priced at $35 million. After 4,050 hours in 1,650 test flights, the Longitude received a provisional FAA type certification on December 20, allowing deliveries in early 2019. The fuel tank flammability requirements were addressed on December 5, with airplanes to be delivered having the definitive installation but limiting it for high elevation airport or RVSM operations, and restricting maintenance. The provisional type certification allowed to begin customer training flights and Textron expects certification in February 2019, while deliveries to NetJets should begin in the third quarter. On September 23, 2019, Textron Aviation announced its FAA Type Certification, after 6,000 flight hours, 11,000 test points and a world tour. The first was shipped in early October. On December 31, 2019, NetJets took delivery of its first Longitude from its order for 150, expecting to enter service early in the first quarter of 2020. ==SpecificationsSee alsoReferences* * Citation Longitude Category:2010s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Twinjets Category:Low-wing aircraft Longitude Category:T-tail aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 2016 ","title":"Cessna Citation Longitude"},{"id":"35955636","text":"Manual Gonsalus was the first non-Indian settler in Mamakating, New York.

There is an ambiguity in the painting that has led art critics to characterize the couple's relationship in divergent ways. == Description == The setting is a conservatory at 70 Rue d'Amsterdam in Paris, then owned by painter Georg von Rosen and which Manet used as a studio for nine months in 1878 and 1879. Such a conservatory may have been more than a greenhouse; French painter Alix-Louise Enault's Consolation depicted the Parisian conservatory as a \\"luxuriously decorated and intimate locale—a secluded indoor area conducive to private rendezvous\\". At first glance, we see a double portrait of a fashionable and attractive couple of some social rank. They are Manet's friends, the Guillemets, who owned a clothing shop. Their married status is conveyed by their rings, and the proximity of their hands is the nearest hint of intimacy. The woman becomes the focus of the portrait, however, being more prominently placed and colourfully dressed. Their physical separation—with the husband Jules slouching in dark clothing behind the bench—their lack of engagement with the viewer, and their abstract gazes create a sense of detachment, which has been the primary theme in modern criticism of the work. The interplay of lines formally defines the work. The woman has an erect posture echoed by the vertical slats of the bench, and the man, though leaning forward, does not break that vertical. The bench continues off the right side, reinforcing the horizontal and the separation of foreground and background. The diagonal pleats on the woman's dress provide some relief from the linearity of the composition. Since the painting's exhibition, critics have interpreted the couple's relationship diversely. Huysmans called the subjects \\"marvelously detached from the envelope of green surrounding them\\". As Collins summarizes: The painting was exhibited in the 1879 Paris Salon and was regarded as surprisingly conservative for Manet. Jules-Antoine Castagnary wrote, with tongue in cheek, \\"But what is this? Face and hands more carefully drawn than usual: is Manet making concessions to the public?\\"—and said it portrayed \\"the elegance of fashionable life\\".Herbert, R. L. (1991). Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society. New Haven, Conn: Yale University Press; p. 182. Manet's Chez le Père Lathuille (see Gallery), having similar subjects and painted later in the same year, may be seen as a companion to In the Conservatory. It was not included in the 1879 Salon.Collins, Bradley. \\"Manet's 'In the Conservatory' and 'Chez Le Père Lathuille.'\\" Art Journal, vol. 45, no. 1, 1985, pp. 59–66. ==Provenance== Jean-Baptiste Faure bought In the Conservatory from Manet, along with three other paintings, for the \\"paltry sum\\" of 11,000 francs. In 1896 the German Nationalgalerie in Berlin purchased it, becoming the first museum anywhere to have purchased a Manet. The previous decade the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York had received two Manets as gifts. In 1945 by the end of the Second World War In the Conservatory was among the objects evacuated from the German National Gallery and the Berlin State Museums and put for safekeeping in a mine in Merkers. After the war the picture was discovered and secured by the Monuments Men. Its salvage was documented in several photographs which show soldiers from the U.S. Army posing with Manet’s painting in the mine in Merkers. These photographs have gained iconographic status over the years and are often falsely used as an illustration of Nazi looted art in prestigious publications like the Deutsche Welle, The Washington Post, The New York Times and even in academic papers. == Gallery == File:Edouard Manet 031.jpgManet, Chez le Père Lathuille (1879) File:Manet - Mme Manet im Gewaechshaus.JPGA portrait of Manet's wife, Suzanne, in a similar setting and also from 1879 File:Stop's 1879 caricature of Manet's In the Conservatory.pngThe caricaturist Morel-Retz (pseudonym \\"Stop\\") published this caricature of In the Conservatory in Journal amusant (May 17, 1879) with the caption \\"An innocent young person cornered in the conservatory by an infamous seducer\\" File:Manet's Wintergarden 19450425 NARA 5757184.jpgThe painting was brought along with other pictures from the German National Gallery to a mine to protect it from the bomb war in World War II.

He was an officer in Toronto's drug squad based in Toronto at the Toronto RCMP Building in the early 1970s. ==Murder of Jeannette Kelly== In 1984, Kelly was convicted of the first-degree murder of his wife Jeannette Kelly by throwing her from the 17th floor balcony of The Palace Pier highrise on Sunday, March 29, 1981, in Toronto, Canada. He stated to police that he had seen his wife on the balcony, reaching out over the rail to investigate a rattle. Kelly testified she then slipped and fell to her death. At Kelly's trial, the Crown had evidence that he was working with organized crime, namely Money Laundering. The prosecution experts testified that the great distance between the edifice and the location of Mrs. Kelly's body could have only occurred if she was strongly pushed. ==Arrest and parole== Kelly was arrested for his wife's murder on March 2, 1983. His trial began in April 1984. He was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility after 25 years. The trial was covered extensively by Ontario and Canadian national news outlets. He was imprisoned at the federal inmate intake unit at Millhaven Institution for several years as a security precaution due to his past as an RCMP officer. He was eventually transferred to William Head Institution on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Kelly was given parole in May 2010. ==Parole revoked== In November 2012, Kelly's federal parole was revoked, mainly because he had too many secretive relationships with women. He was returned to federal prison. In 2016, he was given day parole in 2016 and allowed to reside in Victoria, B.C.Nielson, Mark. \\"Ex-Mountie who killed wife moving to Vancouver Island\\".

He was born at Semaphore, South Australia and died at Adelaide, also in South Australia. Manning was a left- handed lower order batsman and a left-arm orthodox spin bowler. ==Cricket in Australia== Manning was a late starter in first-class cricket and did not make his debut for South Australia until he was 28: thereafter, he was pretty much a regular in the team for two-and-a-half seasons. He took useful wickets and made occasional useful runs but did not, in 19 matches for the team, ever take five wickets in an innings. His best bowling for the South Australia team was four wickets for 39 in the game against Victoria in 1952-53, the season when South Australia won the Sheffield Shield. In most of his state games for South Australia Manning played alongside future Test bowler Jack Wilson, who was a left-arm spin bowler of similar type. ==Move to England== In 1954, Manning moved to England where he played in Lancashire League cricket for Colne for two seasons while waiting to qualify for County Championship cricket with Northamptonshire. He was an immediate success in the 1956 season, when he took 116 wickets: Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that \\"his immaculate length and sharp spin made an excellent foil to the subtle variations of [George] Tribe\\". Manning was awarded his County cap in his first season, which was also, with a fourth-place finish, Northamptonshire's best year in the County Championship since 1912. His best bowling of the season came in just the second match of the season, against the County Champions Surrey at The Oval, when his seven for 68 in the second innings against a full-strength Surrey team led to victory by seven wickets. Northamptonshire did even better in 1957, finishing as runners-up to Surrey in the County Championship, one of only three instances in which the county team has come this close to winning the title. Manning's contribution was 109 wickets in all first-class games and Wisden noted that three left-arm spinners, Tribe, Manning and Michael Allen, took 305 Championship wickets between them. Manning's batting, often useful but rarely prolific, had its day of greatest triumph with an innings of 132, his only first-class century, in the game against Yorkshire at Harrogate, when he put on 191 for the seventh wicket with Keith Andrew, whose 76 was also his highest first-class score. The pattern of Manning's first two years for Northamptonshire was repeated in the wet summer of 1958 and the hot summer of 1959: around 500 runs from the lower order with 86 wickets in 1958 and a better return of 114 in 1959. The 114 included his single best bowling performance: he took eight for 43 in the first innings and five for 44 in the second against Gloucestershire at Peterborough for his best innings and match figures. Tribe retired at the end of the 1959 season and the balance of the Northamptonshire bowling attack shifted dramatically in 1960 as the team fell to the bottom of the table after more than a month without a single victory. Manning - \\"victim of some ruthless rebuilding\\", wrote Wisden in its obituary of him in 1989 - was dropped from the team at the end of May and did not play for the county's first eleven again, the attack being led by newcomers David Larter, a fast bowler from Scotland, and Brian Crump, a seam bowler from the Potteries. Manning played for the county's second eleven across 1960 and 1961, but his only other first-class match was an appearance for a Commonwealth XI in a festival match at the end of the 1960 season, when he signed off with second innings figures of six for 112, five of the six being stumped by his fellow Australian exile, Ben Barnett. ==Retirement== After his playing career ended, Manning returned to South Australia.

The two lines shared a common terminus: Delta, Pennsylvania. Delta was the site of slate quarries which provided significant freight revenue for the railroads.

This year's battle rounds featured a new \\"steal\\" twist. After each battle round the losing artist then pitched to the other three coaches on why they should join their team. It was then up to the coaches (who have a limited amount of time) to press their red button to steal the artist. They could press their button as many times as they liked but were only allowed to steal one artist. If more than one coach wanted to steal the same artist then it was up to the artist to decide which team to join.

Before each knockout round, the coach chose one artist from their team to get a \\"fast pass\\" to the live shows, the remaining six artists from that team were then split up into two groups of three. At the end of each knockout round the coach then decided out of the three artists who won, and therefore made up their three artists to take to the live shows. Episode 1 aired from 8.30pm until 9.40pm, while episode 2 aired from 7.15pm until 8.30pm.

The BBC decided to move the first live show to Friday 7 June to avoid a clash with the Britain's Got Talent final on Saturday 8 June, and the live coverage of the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix on BBC One prevented alternative air dates over the weekend. However, the remaining two live shows still aired on 15 and 22 June 2013. Jessie J performed her latest single \\"Wild\\" on the Final Live Show. The first live show featured a medley of performances from the previous year's winner and finalists, Leanne Mitchell, Bo Bruce, Vince Kidd and Tyler James, and a performance by guest Tom Odell. Avril Lavigne and Beady Eye performed during the semi-final on 15 June. Michael Bublé and Dizzee Rascal featuring Robbie Williams performed on the final on 22 June 2013. ===Results summary=== ;Team’s colour key : Team Will : Team Jessie : Team Tom : Team Danny ;Result's colour key : Artist given 'Fast Pass' by their coach and did not face the public vote : Artist received the fewest votes and was eliminated : Artist received the most public votes {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\\" + Weekly results per artist ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:15%;\\" Contestant ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20%;\\" Week 1 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20%;\\" Week 2 ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:40%;\\" Week 3 - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20%;\\" Round 1 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20%;\\" Round 2 - !ffe5b4\\"  !

It is within both the Virginia and Monticello viticultural areas and is among the 23 wineries on the Monticello Wine Trail. The vineyard was purchased by businessman (now U.S. President) Donald Trump in April 2011 and was officially re-opened in October 2011. Since 2012, it has been owned and operated by Trump's son Eric, under the name Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC. The 227 acres of vinifera varieties makes it the largest vineyard in Virginia and the largest French vinifera on the East Coast. Trump Winery manufactures 36,000 cases of wine per year. It ranks behind two other Virginia wineries that produce at least 60,000 cases of wine per year. The current general manager of the winery, Kerry Hannon Woolard, was a supporter of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and appeared as a guest speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention as well as other campaign events. ==Acquisition== Patricia Kluge, former wife of American billionaire John Kluge, kept Albemarle in the 1990 divorce settlement. Afterwards, Kluge spent her fortune establishing an award-winning vineyard and winery which opened in 1999. She and her third husband, William Moses, took out $65 million in loans and mortgaged the mansion to finance production expansion and a related real- estate venture. In 2011, the couple defaulted on the loans and Bank of America acquired the mortgage on the mansion, Albemarle House. The land outside the mansion’s front door and bordering its long driveway is a 217-acre stretch of rolling greenery that had a former life as John Kluge’s private Arnold Palmer–designed golf course. A quirk in the divorce settlement let John Kluge own this patch, as his ex-wife took the mansion and the land underneath, insulating it from Patricia’s financial woes. The land was still the family’s to give, after Mr. Kluge died in 2010, leaving it in a trust to his son with Patricia as trustee. Trump, a longstanding friend of John and Patricia Kluge, purchased the 1,300-acre estate, including the vineyards and winemaking operation, out of foreclosure from three different banks for $8.5 million. He initially offered the banks $20 million to bail out Kluge Estate, but when they refused, he began to snap up the property through foreclosure auctions and private purchases. After acquiring the winery, Trump hired Patricia Kluge as vice president of operations and William Moses as chief executive officer. He also bought the parcel directly from the Kluge trust for $150,000. The bank alleged that Trump subsequently arranged for \\"No Trespassing\\" signs to be placed around the mansion allowing the lawns to become overgrown in order to ward off potential buyers and to give the appearance of Trump's exclusive access to the property, although the bank's interest in the main house included right-of-way easements. Trump placed a winning bid of $3.6 million at auction for the mansion property, a significant discount from the $16 million the bank had paid at the foreclosure auction and Patricia's original $100 million asking price. Bank of America rejected the bid and retained possession. In October 2012, Trump bought Albemarle House from Bank of America for $6.7 million, completing his acquisition of the entire estate. ==Operations== In addition to the winery and vineyard, business operations include the hotel and facilities to host weddings, corporate and winery events. The remodeled 26,000 square-foot, 45-room mansion was opened in May 2015 as ‘Albemarle Estate at Trump Winery’, a boutique luxury hotel offering guests the opportunity ‘to stay at one of the most prestigious and architecturally significant residences in history.’ In March 2016, Donald Trump stated publicly that he owned \\"the largest winery on the East Coast,\\" although Politifact later surmised the statement as 'false'. Trump Winery makes 36,000 cases of wine per year compared to Williamsburg Winery and Chateau Morrisette Winery, which produces at least 60,000 cases per year, according to The Virginia Wine Board. However, Trump Winery's 227 acre vineyard is the largest in Virginia and its French vinifera acreage is the largest on the East Coast. ==Awards== Numerous gold medals at national and international wine competitions and best-in-class designations. 90 points from Wine Spectator for Blanc de Blanc, 91 points from James Suckling and Wine Enthusiast for Sparkling Reserve. In March 2013, Wine Enthusiast magazine gave the 2007 Trump SP Reserve a 91-point rating, which was at that time the highest rating for a still or sparkling Virginia wine. ==References * Category:2011 establishments in Virginia Category:Food and drink companies established in 2011 Category:Wineries in Virginia Category:Business career of Donald Trump Category:Charlottesville, Virginia ","title":"Trump Winery"},{"id":"35955947","text":"Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester is a restaurant located in The Dorchester, a hotel on Park Lane, London. It is one of over 25 restaurants operated by French-born Monégasque chef Alain Ducasse: the Executive Chef is Jean-Philippe Blondet, who replaced Jocelyn Herland in January 2016. Since 2010, it has been one of five UK-sited restaurants to hold three Michelin stars. It opened in November 2007. ==Description== At the time of opening, Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester was one of over 25 restaurants around the world operated by Ducasse Paris. Alain Ducasse intended the restaurant to have \\"the modernity of Beige in Tokyo, the seriousness of Le Plaza Athénée in Paris and the flavours of Le Louis XV in Monaco meeting the energy of London.\\" The Executive Chef was originally intended to be Nicola Canuti, but Canuti was replaced before opening by Jocelyn Herland, who moved from Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athénée in Paris. Designed by Patrick Jouin and his partner Sanjit Manku, who have already worked with Alain Ducasse in Paris, New York and Las Vegas, the restaurant draws inspiration from British traditions, Hyde Park and even the cuisine of Alain Ducasse himself. Jouin Manku have succeeded in merging tradition with modernity. The tables feature ceramic vegetables as centrepieces, handmade butter dishes in pink marble, and Porthault linen tablecloths. ===Menu=== The restaurant serves contemporary French cuisine using seasonal French and British ingredients. Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester's unique style of contemporary French cuisine is exemplified in its signature dishes which include; “Sauté gourmand” of lobster, truffled chicken quenelles and homemade pasta; Dorset crab, celeriac and caviar; Halibut, oyster and seaweed and Dry aged beef, artichoke and bone marrow; and the Baba like in Monte Carlo. ==Reception== Dorset Crab, celeriac and caviar Mark Palmer visited the restaurant shortly after opening for The Daily Telegraph. The food critic went into the restaurant with high expectations, describing Alain Ducasse opening a London-based restaurant as the moment when \\"God comes to town\\". Particular stand out dishes included halibut with a lemon caper sauce which was described as \\"sensational\\", and a \\"masterpiece\\" of a chocolate praline and orange dessert. An overall rating of eight out of 10 was given. Terry Durack of The Independent wrote that some of the dishes on offer at opening were unbalanced but admired the craftsmanship of the dishes. He said that it wasn't the best Ducasse restaurant he had been to, but gave it 16 out of 20, indicating that it was \\"capable of greatness\\". Food critic Jay Rayner reviewed Ducasse at the Dorchester for The Guardian, wrote that it was disappointing overall given Ducasse's history, having eaten at the Ducasse restaurant in Paris. He wrote that the ingredients were perfectly cooked, but they didn't make up for the combinations involved in the dishes. He described Ducasse as \\"capable of brilliance\\" but that the restaurant was currently a \\"grasping, mediocre experience\\". Matthew Norman reviewed the restaurant for The Guardian after it received its third Michelin star. While he praised the attentive staff, and the quality of the food, he directly compared it to several two-star restaurants he had previously reviewed and had trouble identifying the difference between the general quality of two star and three- star restaurants. He suggested that he may be due to the impact of Alain Ducasse himself. Food critics from Time Out reviewed the restaurant's express lunch menu in 2011, giving it four out of five stars and describing one dish, a rhubarb, strawberry and vanilla millefeuille, as having \\"sang out [the] meal on a high note\\". In 2009, the restaurant appeared in the Michelin guide for the first time, appearing directly with two stars, and was named a Michelin rising star. The following year, this was increased to three Michelin stars; the restaurant becoming only the fourth UK-based three-Michelin star restaurant following The Waterside Inn, The Fat Duck and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. As of 2017 it is one of five UK-based three-Michelin starred restaurants with nine-seat Araki Sushi Restaurant joining in the 2018 Michelin Guide published in October 2017. ==References * Category:Restaurants in London Category:Restaurants established in 2007 Category:Michelin Guide starred restaurants in the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 2007 ","title":"Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester"},{"id":"35955957","text":"Lukas Flüeler (born October 22, 1988) is a Swiss professional ice hockey Goaltender who is currently playing for the ZSC Lions of the National League (NL).

It was first produced at the Theater at St. Peter's Church in the Citicorp Center in Manhattan, New York City, in 1982. The 1982 production, which featured David Naughton of An American Werewolf in London fame, is notable for including in its cast a number of young actors who were beginning to achieve, or later achieved, significant success in television or movies, including Kevin Bacon, Gedde Watanabe and Bronson Pinchot. The play is a comedy that takes place at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, during the period when Yale College was first becoming coeducated. A feminist transfer student from Vassar College named Claire Hazard wishes to join the all-male a cappella singing group called The Whiffenpoofs, who are not amenable to the idea of adding a woman to their group. The title of the play is a reference to the lyrics of \\"The Whiffenpoof Song\\", a traditional song of Yale, which the Whiffenpoofs sing at the end of each of their performances.

It was released on October 4, 2011 by label Fair Trade Services, his fourth album released under that label. The album was produced by Brown Bannister and Peter Kipley. ==BackgroundLife=== Wickham was asked by Bill Lurwick that people may describe this a worship album, and to this Wickham responded by saying \\"I grew up leading worship ever since I was like 13 years old. I was just like the youth group worship leader back in junior high. It’s always been a big part of what I do and I think if you listen to all my past records, songs that people can sing are sprinkled throughout them all. The whole thought of worship is definitely like – we’ve got some more songs written to God than about other things.\\" Wickham went onto further respond, when he said \\"It’s always been a big part of what I do, but this really was the goal of this record. It was on my heart to try to put together a record of songs I could sing with people, and hopefully if they fit, into certain churches. I just love to serve the Church with new songs; hopefully they can sing some of them.\\" ===Theme behind Response=Tim Hughes=== Wickham and Tim Hughes co-wrote the song \\"At Your Name\\" together. The story behind it was that \\"after leading worship at a conference in London with 1500 worship leaders. The next day we were playing around with some ideas...and the idea there's no higher name than God.\\" The conference was at Soul Survivor Church that Hughes invited him to come in order to lead some worship with members of Wickham's church. ==Critical reception== Allmusic's Matt Collar said \\"Response is a melodic and epic blast of modern rock uplift that showcases Wickham's yearning vocals.\\" Collar wrote \\"longtime fans of Wickham's previous work as well as anyone inclined toward spiritual-leaning, adult alternative rock will find much to enjoy on Response.\\" Alpha Omega News' Elise F. graded the album an A+, and said \\"Response is a beautiful story of the heart’s response to God’s love. Phil Wickham has once again created a worshipful masterpiece that will please both longtime fans and new listeners alike.\\" CCM Magazine's Matt Conner said \\"the latest release from Phil Wickham features his trademark atmospheric tunes anchoring vertical lyrics, but the tunes on Response are steeped in stong synth work that adds a new layer to Wickham's work.\\" Christian Music Zine's Tyler Hess said \\"The heart is there and the voice is always powerful and stirring, though I think the songs need a little bit more sizzle in them to maintain my attention over an extended period of time, as they tend to put me in more of a dreamy daze than a get up and go spirit. I don’t really think that this is the best output from Wickham and some of the songs were just a little too generic for what his skill dictates, but there’s enough on here to pick it up if you’re a fan of his earlier work.\\" Christianity Today's Andy Argyrakis said \\"Wickham's a true original thanks to clever wordplay, adventurous arrangements, and the ability to strike just the right balance between reverence and resourcefulness.\\" Cross Rhythms' Tim Holden said \\"this at first hearing may seem like stereotypical modern worship. But a closer listen will reveal the songwriting craft and skilful production which go into each of Wickham's albums and this could easily be his strongest yet.\\" Holden wrote \\"It is a sign of the maturity and depth of this album that no one track jumps out as being head and shoulders above the rest and that any two listeners will probably choose different tracks as their favourite while the Scripture-based lyrics draw us continually back to the Godhead.\\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre said \\"is one of my favourite worship albums in 2011, and if you want to continue to dive into the Lord’s presence; look no further than Phil’s latest effort.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Tyler White said \\"Response is perhaps his most mainstream album to date\\". White wrote \\"It would be easy to dismiss this album as a step back for Wickham, since the feel of the album seems a bit Vanilla compared to his Neapolitan past, but that would be a disservice to his talent. Wickham's songwriting is in a higher caliber than most songs on Christian radio right now, and the San Diego songster pours his heart out with solid arrangements and beautiful thought-out metaphors that feel natural and uncontrived.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Ryan Barbee said \\"sadly, I must say that the album as a whole does not reach the standards that Wickham had established with his previous releases. Still, there are some incredible glimpses of genius even if they take a couple of listens before they can be observed. But for this reviewer, the response is still very mixed.\\" Louder Than The Music's Jono Davies said \\"to summarise, this is a very good album. Great creative songs, great voice and great expressions of praise to God (a few too many great's there maybe). But there is something that's stopping me saying this is an outstanding album. What that is, I'm not sure. But when you hear it, you just know, and on this album I don't always hear it. But overall this is a good, and I'll even use that word again, a great album. Maybe given time this will grow on me more, but for now I am more than willing to express that you should check this out and actually make up your own mind. Melodic.net's Kaj Roth said the \\"album is filled with anthemic pop/rock songs\\". New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis said \\"Wickham provides listeners with eleven tracks that seek to give a voice to humanity’s acceptance of God’s love in any circumstance. In the same way that the Psalms offer expressions of joy, sorrow, repentance, hope and victory, Response gives a voice to the appreciation and adoration of God in every chapter of life.\\" Davis wrote \\"Phil Wickham’s enthusiastic and reverent style of writing and singing praise and worship songs has consistently been a draw for me. Wickham’s prayerful sentiments are consistently filled with his personal adoration of God.\\" Phantom Tollbooth's Michael Dalton said \\"Wickham is doing modern worship as well as anyone. He is among the leaders of a new generation that are declaring God’s praises.\\" Dalton wrote this is album is \\"a powerful God calls for powerful worship, and this song like so many on this release conveys it.\\" ==Track listingChartsAlbum=== { !Chart (2011) !Peak position - US Billboard 200 align=\\"center\\" 43 - US Billboard Christian Albums align=\\"center\\" 3 - US Billboard Digital Albums align=\\"center\\" 13 } ===Singles=== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=2 Year ! rowspan=2 Single ! colspan=4 Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=40 US Christian Songs ! width=40 US Christian AC -  2011-12  align=\\"left\\" \\"At Your Name (Yahweh, Yahweh)\\"  18  24 } ==ReferencesDoug & Jaci interview * Phil Wickham RESPONSE Album Interview YouTube Category:2011 albums Category:Albums produced by Brown Bannister Category:INO Records albums Category:Phil Wickham albums ","title":"Response (album)"},{"id":"35956009","text":"Massaponax Baptist Church is an historic Southern Baptist church built in the Greek Revival style, located in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. The Baptist congregation that built the church was established in 1788 at a small church near Massaponax Creek. When that building became too small to hold the growing congregation, the church was moved to its present location at the intersection of U.S. Route 1 and State Route 608 (Massaponax Church Road). The new church was a small, frame building which was also outgrown. In 1859, the current brick building was constructed on the site. Kilns in a nearby field fired the bricks for the exterior walls. By October 1859 the new church was completed at a cost of $3,000. Joseph Billingsly was the first pastor in the new building. An addition was built in 1949 and a brick cottage for the pastor, was built near the church in 1956. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January 1991. Not long after the new church was occupied, the American Civil War began. Black members of the church were given letters of dismissal. Several small churches were established for the disenfranchised blacks. Church services ended for the duration of the war. During that time, the church was used as a stable, hospital, headquarters for planning strategy. Soldiers used the interior walls to draw scenes of battle, write messages, and leave names of troops, companies, and soldiers. The walls were whitewashed after the war to cover the graffiti. In 1938, during renovation work, the writing on the walls was exposed. Portions of the graffiti are now visible behind plexiglass frames. Grant meets with staff on pews outside Massaponax Baptist ChurchOn May 21, 1864, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, Major General George Meade, other generals and their staffs met at the church after the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Also present was Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana. During the meeting, Grant ordered his troops to carry church pews outside to provide a place for the generals to rest and plan strategy. The meeting was photographed from the second floor of the church by Timothy H. O'Sullivan, a noted 19th-century photographer of the Civil War and, later, of the Western United States. ==References *Massaponax Baptist Church Category:Baptist churches in Virginia Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia Category:Churches completed in 1864 Category:Buildings and structures in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Southern Baptist Convention churches ","title":"Massaponax Baptist Church"},{"id":"35956024","text":"Hawk Springs State Recreation Area is a public recreation area on Hawk Springs Reservoir, located southeast of Hawk Springs and north of La Grange in Goshen County, Wyoming.

The objective of the program was to increase access to free knowledge, in particular without data-usage cost. With 97 operators in over 72 countries, it is estimated that access to Wikipedia was provided to more than 800 million people through this program. The Wikipedia Zero program ended in 2018. The program was launched in 2012, and won a 2013 South by Southwest Interactive Award for activism. After having received criticism over the years for violating the principle of net neutrality, in February 2018 the Wikimedia Foundation announced the end of the initiative, stating that it would take a new approach on partnerships. Despite providing service to 800 million persons, the project was seen as jeopardized by a lack of growth, and by the declining price of cell phone data. Facebook Zero has been cited as an inspiration for Wikipedia Zero. ==History== Wikipedia Zero countries as of September 6, 2016 Below is a selective history of launches.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said, \\"Whilst we appreciate the intent behind efforts such as Wikipedia Zero, ultimately zero rated services are a dangerous compromise.\\" Accessnow.org has been more critical, saying, \\"Wikimedia has always been a champion for open access to information, but it's crucial to call out zero- rating programs for what they are: Myopic deals that do great damage to the future of the open internet\\". The Wikimedia Foundation's Gayle Karen Young defended the program to The Washington Post, saying, \\"We have a complicated relationship to net neutrality. We believe in net neutrality in America\\", while adding that Wikipedia Zero required a different perspective in other countries: \\"Partnering with telecom companies in the near term, it blurs the net neutrality line in those areas. It fulfills our overall mission, though, which is providing free knowledge\\". Hilary Heuler argues that \\"for many, zero- rated programs would limit online access to the 'walled gardens' offered by the web heavyweights. For millions of users, Facebook and Wikipedia would be synonymous with 'internet'.\\" In 2015, researchers evaluating how the similar program Facebook Zero shapes information and communications technology use in the developing world found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, and 61% of Indonesians agree with the statement that \\"Facebook is the Internet\\" compared with only 5% in the United States. An article in Vice magazine notes that the free access via Wikipedia Zero made Wikimedia Commons a preferred way for its users in Bangladesh and elsewhere to share copyrighted material illicitly. This caused problems at Wikimedia Commons (where uploading media that is not free-licensed is forbidden). The Vice article is critical of the situation created by Wikipedia Zero and of the backlash among Wikimedia Commons editors, arguing: \\"Because they can't afford access to YouTube and the rest of the internet, Wikipedia has become the internet for lots of Bangladeshis. What's crazy, then, is that a bunch of more-or-less random editors who happen to want to be the piracy police are dictating the means of access for an entire population of people.\\" ==See also== * Alliance for Affordable Internet * Google Free Zone * Internet.org * Facebook Zero * Facebook for SIM * Airtel Zero ==References * Wikipedia Zero at the Wikimedia Foundation * Wikimedia blog posts about Wikipedia Zero Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Computer-related introductions in 2012 Category:Internet access Category:Net neutrality Category:Projects disestablished in 2018 Category:Projects established in 2012 Category:Wikimedia Foundation Zero ","title":"Wikipedia Zero"},{"id":"35956027","text":"The 1995 Oklahoma Sooners football team represented the University of Oklahoma during the 1995 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Established in 1947, St. Edmund's offers programs from preschool through eighth grade. Although founded as an all-boys Episcopal school in association with the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh, St. Edmund's no longer maintains a religious affiliation and accepts students of either sex and any religious background. The school is named after ninth-century king and martyr Edmund of East Anglia. ==History== St. Edmund's was founded as an all-boys diocesan school in 1947 by a group of parents associated with the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer in Squirrel Hill. The school came to occupy its current location in 1954 when Pauline Mudge, widow of prominent Pittsburgh industrialist Edmund W. Mudge, donated a plot of land adjacent to the parish house of the Church of the Redeemer. Though the school is in present-day no longer religiously affiliated, students still attend a weekly non-spiritual Chapel service in the Church of the Redeemer, in which they celebrate the secular community values of the school community. ==Academics== St. Edmund's curriculum offers preschool, pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first through eighth grade programs. All students wear a traditional school uniform including a white shirt, a tie for boys, and a traditional crimson blazer. The course of study at St. Edmund's is designed such that, by the time students finish the eighth grade, they are prepared to continue in a rigorous four-year college preparatory program. After graduating, St. Edmund's alumni commonly enroll in nearby independent Pittsburgh secondary schools—popular destinations include Shady Side Academy, The Ellis School, and Winchester Thurston School. ==Facilities== St. Edmund's Upper and Lower schools inhabit a three-level building connected by two skywalks.

It is available only in Spanish. There is a version available with English subtitles, as well as a version dubbed in Hindi on the ZEE5 app. It also aired in Arabic dub on Lana TV. ==History== From May 28 to November 1, 2012, Caracol TV aired Escobar: El Patrón del Mal weeknights at 9:30pm. From July 9 to July 27, 2012, Telemundo aired one-hour episodes of Pablo Escobar weeknights at 10pm/9c, replacing Decisiones Extremas. From July 30, 2012 to January 24, 2013, Telemundo aired half-hour episodes of Pablo Escobar and El Rostro de la Venganza weeknights, both sharing the 10pm time slot. From January 25 onwards, one-hour episodes of El Rostro de la Venganza were broadcast. ==Plot== The series begins and ends with his dramatic last moments before being shot to death by agents of the Colombian National Police, while escaping from a relative's home, and later flashing back to his childhood in Valle de Aburra, Colombia, where Pablo is teased by his cousin, Gonzalo, and older brother, Peluche, on a footbridge crossing a creek, eventually rescued by his mother, who scolds Pablo for crying. His mother's influence on Escobar's life choices is portrayed in the first episode and throughout the series, starting with her admonishment that if he is going to do something bad, he had better do it really well, after he is frustrated while trying to cheat on a test and starting a class rebellion to avoid the consequences. As he and Gonzalo became older, they began their lives of organised crime, becoming bodyguards to a well known smuggler and eventually his partners, after successfully standing off with police in what would become Escobar's trademark \\"Plata o Plomo\\" approach to dealing with law enforcement -- \\"accept our bribe or prepare for a shootout with us.\\" After robbing a bank and being turned in by one of their neighbors, Pablo and his cousin start their careers as murderers by killing him. Thereafter, the series follows Pablo's adventures and misadventures in organized crime and eventually cocaine smuggling, building an empire of wealthy criminals who contest power, often violently, with the Colombian state, eventually leading to murders of prominent politicians, policemen, business associates, friends, lovers, and eventually common citizens. The plot focuses on Escobar's contradictory drives to be a good husband; a decent, upstanding, Colombian citizen; a politician; a supporter of the poor; and a wealthy, powerful \\"bandido\\" (an endearing term for criminal, like \\"rascal\\"), all while seeking ever more political power, wealth, and sexual exploits. == Cast == * Andrés Parra as Pablo Escobar ** Mauricio Mejía as Pablo Escobar (young) * Angie Cepeda as Regina Parejo (Virginia Vallejo) * Christian Tappan as Gonzalo Gaviria (Gustavo Gaviria) ** Juan Sebastian Calero as Gustavo Gaviria (young) * Cecilia Navia as Paty Urreade Escobar (María Victoria Henao) ** Eileen Moreno as Paty de Escobar (young) * Vicky Hernández as Enelia (Hermilda Gaviria, Escobar's mother) ** Linda Lucía Callejas as Enelia (young) * Nicolás Montero as Luis Carlos Galán * Marcela Gallego as Gloria Pachón de Galán * Ernesto Benjumea as Rodrigo Lara Bonilla * Diana Hoyos as Nancy Restrepo de Lara * Germán Quintero as Guillermo Cano Isaza * Helena Mallarino as Ana Maria Busquets de Cano * Julio Pachón as Colonel Jairo Jimenez (Jaime Ramírez Gómez) * Alejandro Martínez as Marcos Hérber (Carlos Lehder) * Juan Carlos Arango as Gustavo Ramirez el Mariachi (Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha el Mexicano) * Hernán Méndez as Escobar's father (Abel de Jesus Escobar) * Aldemar Correa as Julio Motoa (Fabio Ochoa Vásquez) * Joavany Alvarez as Pedro Motoa (Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez) * Alejandro Gutierrez as German Motoa (Juan David Ochoa Vásquez) * Andrea Gomez as Irma Motoa (Martha Nieves Ochoa) * Anderson Ballesteros as \\"El chilli\\" (John Jairo Arias Tascón 'Pinina') * Carlos Benjumea as Carlos Motoa \\"El Patriarca\\" (Fabio Ochoa Restrepo) * César Mora as \\"El Alguacil\\" * Toto Vega as Senator Alfonso Santorini (Alberto Santofimio) * Carlos Mariño as \\"Marino\\" (John Jairo Velasquez Vasquez \\"Popeye\\") * Luces Velasquez as \\"Graciela Rojas\\" (Griselda Blanco) * Fabián Mendoza as César Gaviria Trujillo * Susana Torres a Nikki Polanía (Maria Jimena Duzán) * Tiberio Cruz as \\"Diego Pizano\\" (Carlos Pizarro Leongómez) * Orlando Valenzuela as Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa * Andres Felipe Torres as \\"Topo\\" ( Mario Alberto Castaño \\"El Chopo\\" ) *Manuel Viveros as \\"Quico\\" (Dandeny Muñoz Mosquera \\"La Quica\\") == Colombia broadcast == * Release dates and episode names, based on Colombia's Caracol TV broadcast. { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - CCCCCC;\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Canada was the next largest producer with a 13% share, followed by Australia with 12%. Uranium has been mined in every continent except Antarctica. ==AfricaDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)=== Uranium mining in the DRC ceased in 2004 with the closure of the Shinkolobwe mine. Uranium for the Manhattan Project nuclear bombs that were used in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the Second World War came from Shinkolobwe, in the mineral rich province of Katanga, at that time in the Belgian Congo. In 2009 the French conglomerate Areva executed an agreement with the Congolese Minister of Mines on uranium prospecting and mining. Work would start with a detailed inventory of mining sites and update of all databases. In 2011 Areva disclosed that it was unlikely to develop a uranium mine in the DRC until the country became more politically stable. ===Gabon=== In Gabon, mining used to occur in Oklo, but the deposits are reported to be exhausted. In 1972, remains of a natural nuclear fission reactor were found at the Oklo deposits. ===Malawi=== Uranium is produced at Kayelekera mine near Karonga. The mine owned and operated by Australian company, Paladin Energy. As of 2014, the mine is under 'care and maintenance' due to weak uranium prices. ===Namibia=== Namibia produces uranium from three of the world's largest open pit uranium mines. The China National Nuclear Corporation-owned Rössing mine produced of U3O8 in 2018. The China General Nuclear Power Group-owned Husab Mine produced of U3O8 in 2018. The Langer Heinrich calcrete uranium deposit was discovered in 1973 and an open pit mine officially opened in 2007, producing until 2018, when the Paladin Energy-China National Nuclear Corporation joint venture was placed on care and maintenance, due to a sustained low uranium price. Production in 2017 was of U3O8. ===Niger=== Niger was Africa's leading uranium-producing nation until 2016, when it was overtaken by Namibia. In 2019 it was the world's fifth largest producer, with 6% of production. Uranium is produced from the Somair mine at Arlit, 63.4% owned by Orano Cycle and 36.66% by Niger state mining assets company Société du patrimoine des mines du Niger, known as SOPAMIN, and has produced nearly of uranium since operations began in 1971; and the Akouta mine at Akokan, owned by Orano Cycle (34%), SOPAMIN (31%), Overseas Uranium Resources Development Co of Japan (25%) and Enusa Industrias Avanzadas SA of Spain (10%), and has produced more than of uranium since the start of operations in 1978. ===South Africa=== South Africa produces uranium from deposits in Precambrian quartz-pebble conglomerates of the Witwatersrand Basin, at Brakpan and Krugersdorp, Gauteng. The Karoo contains several sandstone-hosted Permian uranium deposits around Beaufort West in the Western Cape. ==AsiaChina=== China mined in 2007 636 tonnes of U3O8, a decrease of 17% of its production in 2006.2007 Annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency ===India=== In Nalgonda District, the Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (the only tiger project in Andhra Pradesh) has been forced to surrender over 3,000 sq. kilometres to uranium mining, following a directive from the Central Ministry of Environment and Forests. In 2007, India was able to extract 229 tonnes of U3O8 from its soil. On July 19, 2011, Indian officials announced that the Tumalapalli mine in Andhra Pradesh state of India could provide more than 170,000 tonnes of uranium, making it as the world's largest uranium mine. Production of the ore is slated to begin in 2012. The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) recently discovered that the upcoming mine in Tumalapalli has close to 49,000 tonnes of uranium reserves. This could just be a shot in the arm for India's nuclear power aspirations as it is three times the original estimate of the area's deposits.url: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south- asia-14196372, title:India: 'Massive' uranium find in Andhra Pradesh, Source: BBC ===Jordan=== Jordan, the only Middle East country with confirmed uranium, is estimated to have around 140,000 tonnes in its uranium reserves plus a further 59,000 tonnes in phosphate deposits. Although no uranium has been mined yet, it was announced in 2008 that the Jordanian government signed an agreement with the French company AREVA to explore for uranium. This will benefit them on building a future nuclear plant in Jordan. ===Commonwealth of Independent States=== Kazakhstan Kazakhstan produced some 7847 tU3O8 (17.3 million pounds) in 2007, much more than in 2006. Kazatomprom's four 100%-owned ISR mining groups (LLP Kazatomprom) combined produced half of the total output. Russia The World Nuclear Association states that Russia has known uranium deposits of 500,000 tonnes and planned to mine 11,000 to 12,000 tonnes per year from deposits in the South Urals, Western Siberia, and Siberia east of Lake Baikal, by 2010. The Russian nuclear industry underwent an overall restructuring process during 2007. The production was high as almost 4,000 tons of tU3O8 (8.8 million pounds) from three operating mines in 2007. Atomredmetzoloto reported that the Priargunsky mine yielded 3,538 tonnes (7.8 million pounds) in 2007, a slight decline from the 3,719 tonnes (8.2 million pounds) reported by TVEL in 2006. At the Dalur (Dolmatovskoye) and Khiagda ISR mines, production of 412 tonnes (910,000 pounds) and 30 tonnes (68,000 pounds), respectively, was reached in 2007. Both ISR projects are expected to increase production steadily through 2015. Uzbekistan In Uzbekistan, the Navoi Mining & Metallurgy Combinat reportedly produced 2,721 tonnes U3O8 or tU3O8 (6 million pounds) from its Nurabad, Uchkuduk and Zafarabad in-situ recovery facilities. ==Australia== The Ranger Uranium Mine in Australia. Expenditure ($millions/quarter) on uranium exploration in Australia since 1988 Production in Australia rose significantly to 10,115 tU3O8 (22.3 million pounds) in 2007 from 9,000 tonnes (19.7 million pounds) in 2006, securing its position as the second largest uranium producing country, most of the production gain coming from increased operational performance and an increase in the grade of the ore mined. Australia has the world's largest uranium reserves, 24% of the planet's known reserves. The majority of these reserves are located in South Australia with other important deposits in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The Olympic Dam operation run by BHP Billiton in South Australia is combined with mining of copper, gold, and silver, and has reserves of global significance. There are currently three operating uranium mines in Australia, and several more have been proposed. The expansion of Australia's uranium mines was supported by the Federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government headed by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The ALP abandoned its long-standing and controversial \\"no new uranium mines\\" policy in April 2007. One of the more controversial proposals was Jabiluka, to be built surrounded by the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park. The existing Ranger Uranium Mine is also surrounded by the National Park, as the mine area was not included in the original listing of the Park. Uranium mining and export and related nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia has a long history.Australia's anti-nuclear movement: a short history (26 August 1998) by Jim Green, Green Left ==EuropeBulgaria=== Bulgaria shut down its facilities for environmental reasons in 1992; terrains were recultivated but recently, there has been certain interest in resuming activities. Industrial mining first started in 1938 and was resumed after 1944 by a joint Soviet–Bulgarian mining company, reorganized in 1956 into the Redki Metali (Rare Metals) government-owned concern. At its peak, it had 13,000 employees, operated 48 uranium mines and two milling plants at Buhovo outside Sofia and Eleshnitsa near Bansko. Yearly production was estimated at 645 t that met about 55% of the needs of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, which had six reactors with a total output of over 3600 MWe at its peak. ===Czech Republic=== The Czech Republic is the birthplace of industrial-scale uranium mining. Uranium mining at Jáchymov (at that time named Joachimsthal and belonging to Austria- Hungary) started in the 1890s on an industrial scale, after the silver and cobalt production of the deposit declined. Uranium was first utilised to produce mainly yellow colours for glass and porcelain manufacture. After the Curies in France discovered the polonium and radium in tailings from Jáchymov, the town became the first place in the world for commercial radium production from uranium ore. Radioactive water from the mines was also used to set up a health resort still existing today for radon-treatments. Pre–Cold War production is estimated to be around 1,000 t of uranium. From 1947 on Czechoslovakia started producing uranium for the Soviet Union. Early mining sites, such as Jáchymov, Horní Slavkov and Příbram, became known as parts of the \\"Czech Gulag\\".See article in Czech: :cs:Koncentrační tábory při československých uranových dolech. In the whole, Czechoslovakia produced 110,000 t of uranium to 1992 from 64 uranium deposits. The largest deposit Příbram (vein style) produced about 50,000 t of uranium and was mined to a depth of over 1,800 m. The Rožná underground facility 55 km northwest of Brno was Central Europe's last operating uranium mine continuously operating since 1957. It produced about 300 t of uranium annually till the 27th April 2017 when the last ore was mined. Czech Republic still has deposits of uranium ore but mining is not planned in the near future due to low price of Uranium. ===Estonia=== During 1946–1952, the Dictyonema argillite (claystone) was mined and used for uranium production in Sillamäe. ===Finland=== A drum of yellowcake In Uusimaa, Karelia and Lapland in Finland, presently (2009) uranium deposits are investigated.Uranium Mining in Finland: Fighting Prospectors in the Nuclear Age - URANIUM MINING IN FINLAND By Renate Nimtz- Köster(05/29/2007)SPIEGEL ONLINE In addition, Talvivaara Mining Company plc has announced in early 2010 the commencement of uranium recovery as a by- product out of its mine producing mainly nickel, copper, zinc and cobalt in Sotkamo, eastern Finland. Production is expected to be approximately 350 tons of yellowcake annually, making Finland almost self-sufficient in uranium, accounting for approximately 80% of annual demand. However, as Finland lacks the required processing facilities to convert yellowcake into nuclear fuel, the mine's output will need to be sent abroad for refining and enrichment. \\\\- Talvivaara to recover uranium as a by-product (09.02.2010) ===Germany=== The search for uranium ore intensified during the Cold War. In East Germany an extensive uranium mining industry was established. Uranium was mined from 1947 to 1990 from mines in Saxony and Thuringia by the SDAG Wismut. It was mostly used by the Soviet Union to build nuclear fission weapons, also as fuel for nuclear power plants. In West Germany more limited mining took place at Ellweiler, Rheinland-Pfalz (1959–1964), and Menzenschwand, Baden-Württemberg (1961–1991). All uranium mines were closed after German reunification for environmental reasons. Some areas were heavily contaminated and clean-up is still not finished. Total production in East Germany was 230,400 t of uranium, making it the third largest producer in history behind the US and Canada. Minor production still takes place at the Königstein mine southeast of Dresden from cleaning of mine water. This production has been 38 t of uranium in 2007. ===Hungary=== In Hungary, uranium mining began in the 1950s around Pécs to supply the country's first atomic plant in Paks. A whole district was built for the mining industry on the outskirt of Pécs, for which the name Uránváros (Uranium city) was given. After the fall of communism, uranium mining was gradually given up because of the high production costs. That caused serious economic problems and a rise of unemployment in Pécs. Recently an Australian company took up the challenge to search for uranium in the Mecsek. ===Portugal=== Portugal has some uranium exploration around the Northern Alentejo town of Nisa, although further exploration of this area is subject to resistance from environmental groups There is also a uranium ore mine in the town of Canas de Senhorim (Viseu) . ===Romania=== Romania produced in 2008 around 250 tonnes of uranium.,About Us Uranium National Company S.A. see SovRoms, Crucea - Botusana mine and Băiţa mine. At the village Ciudanoviţa in the Banat region in the south west of Romania there are closed down mines which provided ore for 50 years but are now closed.http://www.nipne.ro/events/conferences/seminar_sck- cen/docs/CNUiulie009.pdf ===Slovakia=== Uranium was formerly mined in the Novoveská Huta near Spišská Nová Ves from stratiform deposits. Currently there are plans to open a mine for the extraction of uranium ore in the hills of Jahodna near the city of Košice.Košice does not want uranium mines(27 February 2006) - The Slovak Spectator European Uranium Resources (earlier known as Tournigan Energy) is planning to mine uranium at the Kuriskova mine, near Košice, however, the plan is strongly opposed by local inhabitants.Košice: Activists protest against uranium mining in Jahodná again(26 February 2013) - The Slovak Spectator Several other uranium deposits are found in the Považský Inovec Mts. near Kálnica, in the area of Petrova Hora near Krompachy and in the Vikartovský chrbát in Kozie chrbty Mts..Daniel, J., Mašlárová, I., Maslár, E., Daniel, V., Danielová, K., Miháľ, F., 2006, Záverečná správa Zhodnotenie geologických prác na U rudy vo vybraných oblastiach Západných Karpát na území Slovenska. Manuskript, Spišská Nová Ves, Archív URANPRES, 122 s. None of them is extracted. ===Spain=== The Australian company Berkeley Energia Limited is permitting a new open pit uranium mine at Retortillo in a historical uranium mining area, near the city of Ciudad Rodrigo in Salamanca Province. Berkeley is also active in Cáceres, Barcelona and Guadualajara provinces. ===Sweden=== In Sweden, uranium production took place at Ranstadsverket between 1965 and 1969 by mining of alum shale (kind of oil shale) deposits. The goal was to make Sweden self-supplying with uranium. The high operating costs of the pilot plant (heap leaching) due to the low concentration of uranium in the shale and the availability at that time of comparatively cheap uranium on the world market caused the mine to be closed, although a much cheaper and more efficient leaching process, using sulfur-consuming bacteria, had by then been developed. Since 2005 there have been investigations on opening new uranium mines in Sweden. ===Ukraine=== Ukraine's VostGOK produced almost 1,000 tU3O8 (2.2 million pounds) from the Zhovti Vody mill in 2007, which was similar to the 2.1 million pounds produced in 2006. ===United Kingdom=== The South Terras Mine in Cornwall produced 736 tons of uranium ore from 1873 to 1930.Cornwall Calling: South Terras Mine, Cornwall ==North AmericaCanada=== For many years, Canada was the largest exporter of uranium ore; however, in 2009 the top spot was taken over by Kazakhstan. The largest Canadian mines are located in the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. Canada's first uranium discovery was in the Alona Bay area, south of Lake Superior Provincial Park in Ontario, by Dr. John Le Conte in 1847.Nuffield, E. W., 1955, Geology of the Montreal River Area; Ontario Department of Mines, Volume LXIV, Part 3, Sixty- Fourth Annual Report. The Canadian uranium industry, however, really began with the 1932 discovery of pitchblende at Port Radium, Northwest Territories. The deposit was mined from 1933 to 1940, for radium, silver, copper, and cobalt. The mine shut down in 1940, but was reopened in 1942 by Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited to supply uranium to the Manhattan Project. The Canadian government expropriated the Port Radium mine and banned private claimstaking and mining of radioactive minerals.Carlie F. Banks (1976) Uranium and the Uranium Industry in Canada, Richardson, Tex.: Suntech Inc., p. 36–37. In 1947, the government lifted the ban on private uranium mining, and the industry boomed through the 1950s, spurred by high prices due to the nuclear weapons programs. Production peaked in 1959, when 23 mines in five different districts made uranium Canada's number-one export. That same year, however, the United Kingdom and the United States announced their intention to halt uranium purchases in 1963. By 1963, seven mines were left operating, a number that shrank to only three in 1972. A price rise caused uranium to boom again in 1975 and 2005. ===United States=== Most uranium ore in the United States comes from deposits in sandstone, which tend to be of lower grade than those of Australia and Canada. Because of the lower grade, many uranium deposits in the United States became uneconomic when the price of uranium declined sharply in the 1980s. Today nearly all uranium operations in the United States are In- situ leach. Regular production of uranium-bearing ore in the United States began in 1898 with the mining of carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Colorado Plateau in Colorado and Utah, for their vanadium content. The discovery of radium by Marie Curie, also in 1898, soon made the ore also valuable for radium. Uranium was a byproduct. By 1913, the Colorado Plateau uranium- vanadium province was supplying about half of the world supply of radium. Production declined sharply after 1923, when low-cost competition from radium from the Belgian Congo and vanadium from Peru made the Colorado Plateau ores uneconomic.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Denver: Colorado Mineral Resources Board, p. 329–365. Mining revived in the 1930s with higher prices for vanadium. American uranium ores were in very high demand by the Manhattan Project during World War II, although the mining companies did not know that the by-product uranium was suddenly valuable. The late 1940s and early 1950s saw a boom in uranium mining in the western US, spurred by the fortunes made by prospectors such as Charlie Steen. Uranium mining declined with the last open pit mine (Shirley Basin, Wyoming) shutting down in 1992. United States production occurred in the following states (in descending order): New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Florida, Washington, and South Dakota. The collapse of uranium prices caused all conventional mining to cease by 1992. In-situ leach mining has continued primarily in Wyoming and adjacent Nebraska as well has recently restarted in Texas. Rising uranium prices since 2003 have increased interest in uranium mining in the United States. Arizona On Wednesday, 25 June 2008, the House Natural Resources Committee voted overwhelmingly to enact emergency protections from uranium mining for of public lands around Grand Canyon National Park. This will mean the Secretary of the Interior has an obligation to protect public lands near the Grand Canyon from uranium extraction for three years. The Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, and the Grand Canyon Trust recently won a court order against the Kaibab National Forest stopping uranium drilling near the national park until a thorough environmental analysis is conducted.New uranium mining halted at Canyon - Interior Dept. questions order issued by House committee Ginger D. Richardson, The Arizona Republic(Jun. 26, 2008) The Grand Canyon Watersheds Protection Act has been proposed. This bill would permanently ban uranium mining in the area. The impacts of uranium development have raised concerns of scientists and government officials alike. Due to increasing demand, uranium projects have been on the increase, raising concerns about water, public health, and fragile desert ecosystems. Virginia In February 2010, the Commonwealth of Virginia contracted the National Research Council and Virginia Polytechnic Institute to oversee a National Research Council study of potential environmental and economic effects of uranium mining in Virginia. The National Research Council study, funded indirectly by a $1.4 million grant from Virginia Uranium to the Commonwealth, resulted in a report released in December 2011.: Free National Research Council report PDF Uranium mining and processing carries with it a range of potential health risks to the people who work in or live near uranium mining and processing facilities. Some of these health risks apply to any type of hard rock mining or other large-scale industrial activity, but others are linked to exposure to radioactive materials. In addition, uranium mining has the potential to impact water, soil, and air quality, with the degree of impact depending on site- specific conditions, how early a contaminant release is detected by monitoring systems, and the effectiveness of mitigation steps. Some of the worker and public health risks could be mitigated or better controlled through modern internationally accepted best practices, the report says. In addition, if uranium mining, processing, and reclamation were designed, constructed, operated, and monitored according to best practices, near- to moderate-term environmental effects should be substantially reduced, the report found.: Report Public Summary However, the report noted that Virginia's high water table and heavy rainfall differed from other parts of the United States—typically dry, Western states—where uranium mining has taken place. Consequently, federal agencies have little experience developing and applying laws and regulations in locations with abundant rainfall and groundwater, such as Virginia. Because of Virginia's moratorium on uranium mining, it has not been necessary for the Commonwealth's agencies to develop a regulatory program that is applicable to uranium mining, processing, and reclamation. The report also noted the long-term environmental risks of uranium tailings, the solid waste left after processing. Tailings disposal sites represent potential sources of contamination for thousands of years. While it is likely that tailings impoundment sites would be safe for at least 200 years if designed and built according to modern best practices, the long-term risks of radioactive contaminant release are unknown. The report's authoring committee was not asked to recommend whether uranium mining should be permitted, or to consider the potential benefits to the state were uranium mining to be pursued. It also was not asked to compare the relative risks of uranium mining to the mining of other fuels such as coal. Ion exchange resin beads Texas Uranium Energy Corp. began in-situ leach mining at its Palangana deposit (grading .135% U3O8) in Duval County in 2010. Uranium loaded resin beads from that ion exchange facility are processed into yellowcake at the company's Hobson processing plant, one of only three operating processing plants in the United States. The company has three more South Texas deposits permitted or under development.\\"Uranium production begins,\\" Mining Engineering, December 2010. * Handbook of Texas Online: Uranium Mining ==South AmericaArgentina=== Blue Sky Uranium Corp. of Canada, together with an Argentinian partner, announced a 2012 exploration program in Rio Negro Province, and Chubut Province. The company's mining concessions cover 500,000 hectares. The near surface resource is believed to be recoverable through conventional open-pit mining. Other Canadian miners, however, have withdrawn from Argentina in the wake of recent legislation, considered to be unfriendly to the industry. ===Brazil=== Uranium mining was explored in the 1950s, but was halted by the government due to low quality and little profit. ===Paraguay=== Uranium exploration has only recently been undertaken in Paraguay, starting in 2006 by CUE Resources, Ltd. of Canada. Uranium Energy Corporation acquired CUE in 2012. The company's Yuty and Oviedo mining concessions, in the Parana Basin cover 230,650 hectares, roughly 5% of the country. Still in the exploration stage, the resource (grading roughly .05% U3O8) is thought to be favorable for in-situ leach recovery. ==See also== * List of countries by uranium production * List of countries by uranium reserves ==References== ","title":"Uranium mining by country"},{"id":"35956240","text":"Holsteinborg Castle Ulrik Adolf Holstein, Greve til Holsteinborg (14 April 1664 – 21 August 1737) was a Danish nobleman and statesman. ==Life== He was born in Schleswig-Holstein.

He was born on December 3, 1929, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he was raised. He was raised bilingual, speaking fluent English and French. His exposure to film began early in life when his grandmother, Lily Mullins, would frequently take him to the movies, despite Gervaid being under the legal age of fourteen years at the time. Gervais graduated from St. Patrick's Academy Sherbrooke before attending college at Loyola in Montreal. ===Education and ordination=== He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the former Loyola College in Montreal in 1950. (Loyola merged with Sir George Williams University in 1974 to form Concordia University.) He entered the Jesuit order at the Stanislaus Novitiate in Guelph, Ontario, on September 7, 1950, taking his initial vows towards ordination in 1952. He then studied philosophy from Collège de l'Immaculée Conception from 1954 to 1956. Gervais taught English at the former Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal from 1956 to 1958. he also taught drama at Loyola High School (Montreal)Loyola High School from 1957 to 1959 and English literature at St. Stanislaus in Guelph from 1958 until 1959. Gervais was sent to The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., where he received a Master of Fine Arts in drama in 1960. He then studied theology at 403 Wellington Street in Toronto from 1960 to 1961 and completed his courses at Regis College in North York, Ontario, from 1961 to 1964. He began to develop a key interest in films studies while taking his theology courses in the early 1960s. Gervais was ordained a Catholic priest within the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) at regis College on June 16, 1963. Gervais completed his tertianship, the final formal period of formation within the Society of Jesus, from 1964 to 1965 in Saint-Martin-d'Ablois, France. He then relocated to Paris, where he studied communication arts at University of Paris-Sorbonne, where he studied from 1965 to 1968. He took his final vows on February 2, 1968, at the Loyola Residence in Montreal. ===Film professor=== Gervais began teaching film studies in the Communications Arts department, now called the Department of Communication Studies, of Loyola College in 1967, where he remained as a member of the faculty of Loyola and Concordia for thirty-five years. He automatically joined the faculty of Loyola's successor, Concordia University, when that university was formed in 1974 via the merger of Loyola and Sir George Williams University. He remained at Concordia until his retirement in 2003. Gervais simultaneously continued his studies in film, receiving a doctorate in film esthetics from Sorbonne in 1979. Gervais' film courses touched on all parts of film history and theory, He taught courses focusing on the filmography of specific film directors, including Quentin Tarantino, John Ford, and Alfred Hitchcock. Film genres taught by Gervais including musicals, French New Wave, Westerns, silent films, and Italian neorealism. For a specific course called Film Ideas, Gervais screened one movie a week at the now abandoned Empress Theatre in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighborhood of Montreal. Public film screenings were held in the basement of the former Loyola Chapel, now known as the F.C. Smith Auditorium. Gervais taught hundreds of film students during his academic career. Among them are television producer John Kent Harrison, 2004 Academy Award winner Denys Arcand, Robert Wertheimer, and film producer, Kevin Tierney. His students also included several prominent Canadian journalists, including Paul Cherry, a reporter for the Montreal Gazette, and Hana Gartner, an investigative journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. ===Film festivals=== Gervais attended the Cannes Film Festival in France for thirty-nine festivals, serving on numerous Cannes juries. He would send his film reviews to newspapers and other media in Montreal, where his film critiques were published. He served as the chairman of several juries for the Cannes Film Festival, as well as the Venice Film Festival and the Oxford Film Festival. Gervais notably defended Italian film director Pier Paolo Pasolini before a jury at the Venice Film Festival in 1968. In 2000, the Cannes Film Festival awarded Gervais the Cannes Festival Critics Award for attending and contributing to forty of the festivals. ===Writings and film consultancy=== He authored several biographies on notable film directors, including a 1973 book on Pier Paolo Pasolini. He authored Ingmar Bergman: Magician and Prophet, published by McGill-Queen's University Press in 1999, which is considered a landmark study on Ingmar Bergman's work. Father Gervais also contributed his expertise as a film consultant on several films with Roman Catholic themes. The films include Agnes of God in 1985, The Mission in 1986, and Black Robe in 1991. ===Additional works=== Additionally, Father Gervais served as a commissioner of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission from 1981 until 1986. He became the founder and founding director of the Loyola Institute for Studies in International Peace at Concordia University in 1997, for which he received the UNESCO/HAS Peace Award that same year. He was also a founding member of the Lonergan University College of Concordia in 1975. Gervais retired from Concordia University on July 31, 2003. Though a resident of Loyola College or the nearby area for most of his adult life, Gervais was a Boston Bruins fan. He remained a film consultant until 2009, when his health seriously deteriorated. In 2009, he moved to the Rene Goupil Jesuit Infirmary in Pickering, Ontario, where died from complications of dementia on March 25, 2012, at the age of 82. ==References * Category:1929 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Canadian Jesuits Category:Canadian academics Category:Canadian film critics Category:Canadian film educators Category:Canadian non-fiction writers Category:Concordia University faculty Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:Loyola College (Montreal) alumni Category:Writers from Sherbrooke ","title":"Marc Gervais"},{"id":"35956369","text":"Morris Kurtzon (1875, in LithuaniaInformation from Kurtzon.com website – ?) was the president and founder of Mount Sinai Hospital of Chicago from its inception in 1919 until 1945. Mount Sinai was a hospital founded to help the disadvantaged eastern European Jews of Chicago. Kurtzon sought to provide the West Side community in Chicago a hospital where Jewish doctors could practice without prejudicial practices excluding them. Kurtzon bought the bankrupt Maimonides Hospital, reorganizing it under the name Mt. Sinai Hospital Association. He refused an offer to sell the property to the University of Illinois, preferring to donate it to the entire community. The community responded to this gesture with an effort to create financial support for the new hospital. Although women had not traditionally been allowed to fully participate in many communities, Mt. Sinai included many women among its supporters. Kurtzon devoted much of his time to planning and designing the facility. The final hospital plans were done by architects Schmidt, Garden and Ericksen. Kurtzon was vice president of the Chicago Platers Union in 1890 and founded Garden City Plating & Manufacturing (GARCY) in 1898. GARCY designed custom equipment for the new hospital, much of it made of stainless steel. GARCY became Morris Kurtzon, Inc. after 1948 and then Kurtzon Lighting, which is still owned and operated by family members. ==References *www.juf.org *www.kurtzon.com *Chicago Jewish history Category:1875 births Category:Year of death missing Category:American businesspeople ","title":"Morris Kurtzon"},{"id":"35956391","text":"Photography and Photographic may refer to: *Photography, the art and science of creating photographic images *Photography, a 1973 Hungarian film *\\"Photographic\\" is a song by Depeche Mode on their album Speak & Spell ==See also== *Fotografia (disambiguation) ","title":"Photography (disambiguation)"},{"id":"35956398","text":"Richard Albert (born 20 September 1963 in Toronto) is a Canadian former field hockey player who competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Canada Category:Field hockey players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games field hockey players Category:Field hockey players at the 1987 Pan American Games Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:Pan American Games medalists in field hockey ","title":"Richard Albert (field hockey)"},{"id":"35956450","text":"Louis C.

The marriage took place after he had made the theocracy Montenegro into a monarchy by renouncing his title as Prince Bishop of Montenegro for the title and position of Sovereign Prince of Montenegro. She was thereby the first in her position as well. Darinka formed the new royal court in Montenegro and thereby she introduced many Western European customs. She could speak Latin, French, Russian, and Italian, and encouraged Danilo to learn French and Russian; she is also thought to have had an effect on his policy toward Russia. She initially kept her dominant position at court also after the death of Danilo and during his successor, Nikola, with whom she was close.

The original bridge was built in 1958 and rehabilitated in 1996. The bridge was demolished in 2012-13 and replaced with a new deck arch bridge that was completed in summer 2013.RIDOT info In November 2016, the bridge was officially renamed the James E. Doyle Pawtucket River Bridge in memory of the former mayor of Pawtucket, who died two months earlier. ==Deterioration== In November 2007, in the aftermath of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in Minnesota, the Pawtucket River Bridge was declared structurally deficient and in danger of further deterioration, forcing the State of Rhode Island to ban vehicles with more than 2 axles and weight over . Truck drivers violating this restriction faced fines of $3,000 per violation. State police vehicles were posted on both sides of the bridge to enforce the restriction. Truckers were required to seek alternate routes, often exiting and passing through residential neighborhoods in Pawtucket and Central Falls, Rhode Island. Residents of these cities complained about the traffic, noise, and road deterioration that these trucks are causing. Truckers continued to cross the bridge in spite of the fines. From November 2007 through February 2009, state police issued more than 5,600 violation notices and more than $3 million in fines. In 2011 it was reported that the state government of Rhode Island had collected around $7 million in fines. The state has not shared the revenues with the cities of Pawtucket and Central Falls, which bear the brunt of the detours that the truckers must take. With the opening of the new South 95 bridge on 9/15/2012, the axle restriction has ceased. ==Replacement== In 2010, construction began on a new replacement bridge that was built in three phases, beginning with a new span to the south of the old one, which opened to northbound traffic in early 2012. The original northbound span was then demolished and rebuilt. In September 2012, the new middle span opened to temporary southbound traffic, ending all weight restrictions on the Pawtucket River Bridge. The original southbound span was then demolished and rebuilt. The new $82 million bridge was completed in summer 2013 and all traffic shifted to their permanent lanes. ==See also== * * * ==References== Category:Bridges in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Bridges on the Interstate Highway System Category:Road bridges in Rhode Island Category:Interstate 95 Category:Bridges completed in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in Rhode Island Category:Arch bridges in the United States ","title":"Pawtucket River Bridge"},{"id":"35956677","text":"The 2012–13 Dynamo Dresden season is the 63rd season in the club's football history.

He founded the town of Palmyra, New York. == Early life == Swift was born on June 17, 1761, in Kent, in what was then the Connecticut Colony. His parents were Elisha Swift and the former Mary Ransom; one of his brothers, born two years later, was Philetus Swift, who eventually became a prominent legislator in New York State. == Revolution == Swift enlisted in the Continental Army and served as a private in Elmore's Regiment (an unnumbered regiment in the Connecticut Line) under Captain Lathrop Allen. == Pennamite Wars == Swift was among the Connecticuters who attempted to settle in the Wyoming Valley in northeastern Pennsylvania, sparking the Second Pennamite-Yankee War. When the Pennsylvania legislature decided the land claims in favor of the Pennsylvania Mennonites, Swift decamped for Western New York (even though the Connecticut settlers were eventually granted Pennsylvania residency). == Palmyra == In the winter of 1788–89, with the Wyoming Valley situation not going in the Connecticuters' favor, John Swift and John Jenkins purchased a large tract within the Phelps and Gorham Purchase in what is now Wayne County, New York, with the intent of helping their fellow Connecticuters settle there instead. When Swift set up residence near Ganargua Creek in 1790 (after buying out Jenkins), the area was named \\"Swift's Landing\\". It later was named \\"Tolland\\" before being renamed \\"Palmyra\\" at the first town meeting in 1796. == Life in Palmyra == Swift had married Rhoda Sawyer on March 6, 1784; her brother was the one who proposed the name \\"Palmyra\\" in 1796. After Rhoda's death, Swift later married Hepsibah Treat Davidson. He had four children by his first wife and three more by his second. == War of 1812 == Swift re-entered military service when the War of 1812 broke out, as a member of the New York Volunteers, and was assigned the rank of brigadier general. In July 1814 (between the Battle of Chippawa and the Battle of Lundy's Lane), Swift's unit was on the Canadian side of the Niagara River as the American forces attempted to invade Upper Canada. On July 12, Swift led a charge to take Fort George, near modern-day Niagara-on-the- Lake. After capturing a picket post, Swift was assassinated by one of the defenders, whose weapons he had not confiscated. He was initially buried there, but a group of Palmyrans repatriated his remains to the cemetery that today bears his name, the General John Swift Memorial Cemetery. == References == Category:Continental Army officers from Connecticut Category:American military personnel killed in the War of 1812 Category:United States Army generals Category:People from New York (state) in the War of 1812 Category:1761 births Category:1814 deaths Category:People from Kent, Connecticut Category:People from Palmyra, New York Category:Military personnel from Connecticut ","title":"John Swift (general)"},{"id":"35956778","text":"The 2013 Rolex Sports Car Series season was the fourteenth and final season of the Grand American Road Racing Association's premier series, before merging up with the American Le Mans Series in 2014.

Jumbo Interactive operates ozlotteries.com, one of Australia's largest e-commerce websites retailing Australian lotteries, such as Saturday Lotto, Oz Lotto and Powerball. Jumbo Interactive is a publicly listed corporation on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX:JIN). ==History== Jumbo Interactive was founded by Mike Veverka in 1995 as a software developer and an Internet Service Provider in Queensland, Australia. In 1999, the Company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange as Jumbomall.com, a concept to provide e-commerce services to merchants around the globe wishing to sell products via the internet. Focus shifted towards Internet lotteries when the Interactive Gambling Act was passed by the Australian Parliament in 2001. Starting with smaller state-based charity lotteries, the Company shifted to national lottery games with the acquisition of TMS Global Services in 2005. This business operated a lottery network since 1984 in various Pacific nations in agreement with Tattersalls. Jumbo acquired Manaccom, a software publisher, in 2007 and focus shifted towards the Internet and to the development of Oz Lotteries website, which continues to this day, having serviced in excess of 1.5 million customers. In May 2017 Jumbo’s alliance with the largest and most dominant company in the Australian Gaming Industry, the Tatts Group, was strengthened, with the Tatts Group investing $15.6 million in Jumbo, and acquiring a 15% stake in Jumbo. In November 2019, Jumbo acquired the UK lottery manager Gatherwell limited, which creates, launches and manages lottery systems. ==Operations== Jumbo is an online retailer of official government and charitable lotteries across a range of digital platforms. Jumbo Interactive has agreements with the Tatts Group to operate in New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory, South Australia and Fiji, offering a suite of lottery games conducted by the Tatts Group. In 2015, Jumbo added charity lottery games to its product offering. Jumbo has direct contracts with some of the major Australian charity lotteries, including Surf Life Saving Lotteries, Mater Prize Home, and the Endeavour Foundation. The charity lottery games are complementary to national lottery games. Jumbo Interactive is a member of APLA (Asia Pacific Lottery Association), WLA (World Lottery Association) and NASPL (North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries). Jumbo Interactive helps raise money for government social initiatives such as education and health, and grows the market by offering customers an additional purchase source. Over $22 million of additional government duties were raised in FY2012, up from $17 million in FY 2011. ==Financial Statements== At the end of financial year 2016, Jumbo Interactive's TTV (total transaction value) was $156 million. The company's flagship website www.ozlotteries.com continued its unbroken run customer growth since relaunch in 2005 with its database increasing by 10% even in a period of reduced jackpots. Comparing like-for- like jackpots, sales are growing consistently, with the TTV for FY2017 reaching $142 million. The 2017 financial year saw Jumbo reach a Net Profit After Tax of $7.6 million on a continuing basis. Jumbo’s share price has increased 67% in the past 12 months from July 2016. ==References *Company Listing ASX *\\"Jumbo Interactive back from the dead\\", Australian Financial Review *Asia Pacific Lottery Association *World Lottery Association Category:Technology companies of Australia Category:Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Australian companies established in 1995 ","title":"Jumbo Interactive"},{"id":"35956807","text":"The Kingfield POPS is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization operating out of Kingfield, Maine. Throughout the year, the Kingfield POPS sponsors a number of events and programs designed to bring live music to the surrounding communities with the goal of enhancing regional economic development. The Kingfield POPS mission is to provide music and arts programming for regional residents, youth, and schools, as well as visitors to the area, and to inspire economic growth through a vibrant arts environment. ==History== In 2003, the Kingfield POPS began as a project of the Mt. Abram Economic Development Association to bring business to the Kingfield area, and to provide a fun, family event to the local residents. The Bangor Symphony Orchestra was hired to play a concert in June 2003, and with a local steel drum band (the Western Mountain Trash Can Band) to open the show, the Kingfield POPS annual summer concert was born. Several years later, a daytime arts festival was instituted to bring more focus to local businesses, artists, artisans, and musicians. During the first year, the Kingfield POPS brought the Bangor Symphony Orchestra and other performers to the local school district. Over the years, the POPS has expanded, and now brings live music performance events in various musical genres to two regional school districts, and the surrounding community. ==Annual concert== The annual summer concert is the Kingfield POPS major summer event. It is an outdoor concert held the last Saturday in June in a field at the Kennedy Farm outside Kingfield. The concert features the Bangor Symphony Orchestra and a variety of other local musicians, and concludes with a fireworks show in the evening. The event draws at least 1000 people to the area every year, and aims to be accessible to families in an under-serviced, rural area. To promote accessibility, the concert is free to youth up to age 17. ==Arts festival== The Festival of the Arts was instituted a few years after the formation of the Kingfield POPS as a way to incorporate local businesses into the POPS concert experience. The festival takes place during the day of the last Saturday in June in downtown Kingfield. It is a free event that features the work of artists and artisans from all over the state of Maine, and live music from local youth performers throughout the day. ==Friday art walks== Kingfield First Friday Artwalks began in the winter of 2010. In the winter of 2011-2012, thanks to a grant from the Maine Community Foundation, the Kingfield POPS sponsored live music for the First Friday Artwalks in downtown Kingfield. This grant also supported POPS Friday Artwalk on June 29, 2012. ==School programs== Throughout the school year, the Kingfield POPS brings fine, live music events with the Bangor Symphony Orchestra and other performers to two school districts in Maine. The first school program took place in 2003, a few months after the first concert. These events, which sometimes include master classes with visiting musicians, are presented with the aim to inspire young musicians to learn more about music as an art form. The POPS sponsors school music groups so they can attend important musical events and performance opportunities outside of the school venues. The POPS also held a musical instrument drive for instruments that were purchased but no longer used that could be refurbished and loaned to students who cannot afford to purchase or rent an instrument for participation in school music programs. ==See also== *Music of Maine *Maine State Music Theater *Maine Summer Youth Music ==References * Noel Paul Stookey live on 207 * Kingfield POPS! * WSKI-TV Sugarloaf coverage of Kingfield POPS 2010 * Kingfield POPS & Boreal Tordu on Morning Classical with Suzanne Nance Category:Organizations based in Maine Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Franklin County, Maine ","title":"The Kingfield POPS!"},{"id":"35956811","text":"Steve Elliott is a fictional character on Petticoat Junction.

Late in life Lawton became active in the affairs of the colony, and served for several years as both Deputy to the General Assembly, and Assistant to the governor. His house was sometimes used for meetings of colonial leaders and committees. He became such a highly esteemed member of the colony, that in 1676 he was one of 16 individuals whose counsel was requested by the General Assembly during the chaotic events of King Philip's War. == Life == Baptized in the parish of Cranfield in Bedfordshire, England on 23 September 1607, George Lawton was the oldest of eight children of George Lawton and Isabel Smith. About 1637 he left England for New England, probably accompanied by his younger brother Thomas. In 1638 Lawton was accepted as an inhabitant of Aquidneck Island, in what was soon to become the town of Portsmouth in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Dissension arose among the leaders of this colony, and in April 1639 a group of nine individuals signed an agreement for a government and moved to the south end of the island to establish the town of Newport. Within days of this, on 30 April, Lawton was one of 29 inhabitants remaining in Portsmouth who signed their own compact for a government. In 1648 he was granted 40 acres of land, near that of his brother Thomas, and this same year he became a member of the Court of Trials. His name appears on a list of Portsmouth freemen in 1655, and in 1665 he became involved in the service of the colony as a Deputy to the General Assembly, a position he held for five of the next 15 years. Lawton had a land interest in Conanicut Island (now Jamestown, Rhode Island), and in March 1672 sold 24 acres to merchant Richard Smith of Newport. Lawton was one of 16 prominent citizens whose counsel was sought during King Philip's War. The year 1675 brought about the beginning of King Philip's War, the most devastating event to occur in the Rhode Island colony prior to the American Revolutionary War. During this war all of Warwick, all of Pawtuxet, and much of Providence were destroyed. In April 1676 the General Assembly voted \\"That in these troublesome times and straits in this colony, the Assembly desiring to have the advice and concurrence of the most judicious inhabitants, if it may be had for the good of the whole, do desire at their next sitting, the company and counsel of..\\" and 16 names are thereafter written, among which is the name of George Lawton. In May 1676 Lawton and John Easton were directed to go to Providence to determine if garrison houses there should be maintained at the colony's expense. In October 1678 the Assembly determined that a meeting was to be held at Lawton's house the following January to audit the accounts between Newport and Portsmouth concerning the expenses from the recent war. In May 1680 Lawton and two others were empowered to purchase a bell for the colony, to be used for giving notice of the sittings of the assemblies, courts of trial, and general councils. Previously these assemblies were gathered by drum beat. A bell was purchased for £3 10s from Freelove Arnold, the daughter of the late Governor Benedict Arnold. In 1680 Lawton was elected to the position of Assistant, and held this position for seven of the next ten years. In January 1690 he was one of six Assistants who drafted a letter to the new English monarchs, William III and Mary II, congratulating them for their accession to the throne, and also mentioning the seizure of Governor Andros in Rhode Island, and his removal to Massachusetts for trial. Lawton died on 5 October 1693 and was buried in his orchard in Portsmouth. == Family == Although the exact date is unknown, it is believed that in 1647 Lawton married the much younger Elizabeth Hazard, the daughter of early Newport founder Thomas Hazard (Lawton may have been older than his father-in-law). The couple had ten known children, of whom Isabel married Major John Albro, Mary married John Babcock, and John married Mary Boomer. George married Naomi Hunt, Robert married Mary Wodell, and Ruth married William Wodell. Susanna married Thomas Cornell, Mercy married James Tripp, Elizabeth married Robert Carr, Jr., and Job did not marry. Lawton's brother, Thomas Lawton (1614-c.1681) was also an early inhabitant of Portsmouth. Among George Lawton's descendants is Gideon Cornell, the first Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. ==See also== * List of early settlers of Rhode Island * Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ==References Bibliography === * * == External links == *Lawton genealogy * Lawton genealogy, 2005 Category:1607 births Category:1693 deaths Category:People from Cranfield Category:People from Portsmouth, Rhode Island Category:People of colonial Rhode Island ","title":"George Lawton (settler)"},{"id":"35956874","text":"Susie Scanlan (born June 4, 1990 in St. Paul, Minnesota ) is an American epee fencer.

It is the first element of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures. As with all of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical response to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. ==Background== The source for the entire Brushstrokes series was Charlton Comics' Strange Suspense Stories \\"The Painting\\" #72 (October 1964) by Dick Giordano. Prior to producing his first Brushstrokes work, Lichtenstein spun his upcoming work as a \\"satirical send-up of Abstract Expressionism\\" by saying: \\"I'm thinking now of doing something on Abstract Expressionism...The problem there will be to paint a brush stroke, a picture of a brush stroke...Purposely dripped paint and things, you know, where the drips are actually drawn drips that look like drops of water drawn by a commercial artist.\\" Despite the initial objective of parodying Abstract expressionism, the source for the first Brushstrokes work was a comic strip. Measuring 122.5 cm × 122.5 cm (48.25 in × 48.25 in), Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series. The source for the entire Brushstrokes series was Charlton Comics' Strange Suspense Stories 72 (October 1964) by Dick Giordano. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, in addition to this painting named Brushstrokes, there are also both a sculpture and a screenprint by the same name. There is also \\"Brushstrokes 1970\\". The Lichtenstein Foundation website also notes that he began creating the Brushstrokes painting in the autumn of 1965 and presented the Brushstroke series at Castelli's gallery from November 20 through December 11. ==Detail== As with many comics-based works, the connection to the source is evident in Brushstrokes. This work depicts a cropped derivation of the source image. In Brushstrokes, as in its source, a hand holds a house painter's paintbrush in the lower left hand corner of the image, while in the upper right a few strokes of paint as well as spatterings of paint are presented. Lichtenstein selected this source because he \\"...liked the summary rendering of the hand holding the brush and the way in which the cartoonist indicated paint\\". The three strokes in the upper right are the dominant imagery, while the partial view of the hand in the lower left limited by the edges of the canvas shows paint dripping from the brush. This is an example of Lichtenstein humorously presenting a subject that might be crowded out in a newspaper via a parody that relies on the difference between art and the rest of the world. ==See also== * 1965 in art ==Notes *Lichtenstein Foundation website details Category:1965 paintings Category:Paintings by Roy Lichtenstein Category:Paintings of the Whitney Museum of American Art Category:Paintings about painting ","title":"Brushstrokes"},{"id":"35956899","text":"Friedrich Ludwig Meissner (25 August 1796, Leipzig - 4 December 1860) University of Leipzig Meissner, Friedrich Ludwig (1796-1860) [HistVV] was a German obstetrician, gynecologist and pediatrician.

A member of the Colorado Music Hall of Fame, he is best known for his work with Chris Daniels & the Kings, a band he has led since 1984. He is considered an \\"icon of Colorado music\\" and is recognized for his role as a member of Magic Music, frequently described as Colorado's first jam band. ==Early life and career== Daniels was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and began playing guitar when he was 10. At seventeen, he moved to the East Coast and performed with several groups, and for a short time played in a band led David Johansen, who later formed The New York Dolls. In 1971, Daniels moved to Colorado, and in 1972 he joined an acoustic jam band, Magic Music, which would come to be regarded as Colorado's first jam band. In addition to songwriting and singing, Daniels played lead guitar, mandolin, and banjo with Magic Music, whose members included Will Luckey, George Cahill, Bill Makepeace, Tim Goodman of Southern Pacific and Navarro/Leftover Salmon bassist Rob Galloway. The group toured extensively in the United States and appeared at the 2nd and 3rd Telluride Bluegrass Festival. The band broke up in 1976. Daniels subsequently resumed his education, and attended Berklee College of Music and Macalester College. He graduated cum laude from Macalester in 1979. After receiving his degree, Daniels returned to Colorado and formed Spoons, who in 1981 released the album Definitely Live on Sunshine Records. In 1982, he toured the United States with Russell Smith of the Amazing Rhythm Aces, performing on guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He also founded a late night concert series called \\"After Hours Jam\\" at the Sheridan Opera House in Telluride. He served as the bandleader and master of ceremonies for the series, which included performances by Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill, Edgar Meyer, Victor Wooten, Henry Paul, Howard Levy, Jonell Mosser, Bill Payne, Al Kooper and others. Daniels met David Bromberg at the After Hours Jam, and they later played together at concerts in Colorado, Chicago, and New York. In 1989, Daniels appeared on Bromberg's album Sideman Serenade. In 1983 he performed with New Grass Revival (Sam Bush, John Cowan, Bela Fleck, and Pat Flynn) at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. In 1984, Daniels formed Chris Daniels & The R&B; Kings (later shortened to The Kings). Although originally planned as a \\"Boulder one-nighter,\\" the band has released 14 albums and toured extensively in the United States and completed 21 European tours. Acclaimed for their live performances as well as their records, Chris Daniels & the Kings have performed at prestigious festivals including the Carolina Downhome Blues Festival, Parkpop in the Netherlands and Marktrock in Belgium. They have performed for three US presidents and the former queen of the Netherlands, and have been featured on a variety of American and European television shows. They became the Friday night headliner at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in 1986 and continued in that role through 1991. In addition to performing their own music—a blend of jump blues, funk, R&B; and swing—the Kings served as the back up band for artists including Bromberg, Sam Bush, Was Not Was, Bonnie Raitt, John Cowan, Al Kooper, Francine Reed, The Coasters, Henry Paul, The Platters, The Drifters, Bo Diddley and Percy Sledge. In 1995, Daniels received a Master of Arts in History/Economic History at the University of Colorado at Boulder. From 1995-2000, he served as the executive director of the Swallow Hill Music Association, an influential roots, folk, and acoustic music school and concert organization. He began teaching in 2002 as an adjunct professor at Arapahoe Community College. Following his tenure at Arapahoe, he joined the faculty of the University of Colorado, Denver. He is an assistant professor in the College of Arts & Media and serves as the area head for the music business program. Daniels was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in February 2010. He underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant via stem cells from his sister, Dr. Jane Moffet, and returned to recording, teaching and performing that fall. In 2012 he released Better Days, a solo album dedicated to \\"those who go through hard times.\\" A return to roots music, it appeared on the national Americana charts. As a songwriter, Daniels has collaborated with artists including Gary Nicholson, Al Kooper, and Bill Payne and his songs have appeared on albums by Hazel Miller and Tom Wasinger, among others. Daniels' music has been featured on the television show Men in Trees, and, as a commercial singer, he has worked on commercials for companies including McDonald's, Ford Motor Company, and Coors Beer. Daniels was a co-nominee for a 2013 Grammy Award for Jumpin' Jazz Kids, a children's album he worked on with Al Jarreau, Hubert Laws and Dee Dee Bridgewater. That same year, Daniels was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame, along with Judy Collins, The Serendipity Singers and Bob Lind. In 2015, Daniels released Funky to the Bone, which was critically acclaimed by international media outlets and blues and soul magazines including Downbeat and Roots Music Report. Daniels teaches full-time and performs more than 100 shows a year. In early 2018, Daniels was named the executive director of the Colorado Music Hall of Fame. ==Discography== {  - ! Year !! Title !!

At the same time, Jamal brings to many of these tracks a harmonic sophistication and an ability to develop material that few pianists working today could match. The intelligence with which he merges various Ellington themes in 'I Got It Bad,' the startling chord changes he brings to 'In a Sentimental Mood' and the intricate way he works out themes in 'Chelsea Bridge' all recommend this disc.\\"Reich, H.

A prolific artist, in his day he was highly esteemed. His work is now largely forgotten, although it can still be seen in many public locations. ==Early years== Ponciano Ponzano was born in Zaragoza on 19 January 1813. His father was a guard at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Luis, and he grew up among works of art. As a child he showed a great love of drawing and painting. He studied sculpture in the neoclassical style under José Álvarez Cubero at the Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. In 1832 he was awarded a gold medal. Impressed by a historical relief that he had made, the Academy of San Fernando awarded him a grant to study in Rome. There he was able to study sculpture from the Greco-Roman era under masters such as Bertel Thorvaldsen and Pietro Tenerani, and achieved some success with his own dramatic works. One of these, Ulysses recognized by Eurycles, gained such good reviews that on his return to Spain in 1838 he was named an academic of merit. ==Later career== On his return to Spain Ponzano established a workshop in Madrid. He received many commissions, particularly for busts of members of the government and the royal family. He was appointed the official sculptor of the court of Queen Isabella II of Spain, and his career blossomed. He became a prolific sculptor of reliefs, statues and memorials. In 1848 he won a competition to decorate the pediment of the Congress of Deputies. In 1862 he was commissioned by the Queen to create the Pantheon of the Princes of the Monastery of El Escorial, but he was unable to complete the work. He was appointed a professor of the Madrid School of Fine Arts in 1871. Ponzano died on 15 September 1877 in Madrid. In his day Ponciano Ponzano was one of the most highly regarded of Aragonese sculptors. He moved in high social circles, and was considered to be of excellent moral character. However, his work has been criticized as not being authentically creative. The neoclassical tradition was essentially sterile and he lived in a period when Spanish and European sculpture was in decline, with little innovation. Due to changes of fashion, his work has now been largely forgotten, although it is still preserved in private collections and in public monuments such as San Lorenzo de El Escorial. ==Sample works== Ponzano created a large group The Flood for Francisco de Borja Queipo de Llano, 8th Count of Toreno. It depicts a naked man climbing with his mother carried on his shoulder to save her from the flood. The facade of the Congress of Deputies centers on a sculpture of Spain embracing the constitutional state, represented by a woman with her arm around a young girl. Surrounding the pair are figures that represent in allegorical form Justice and Peace, Science, Agriculture, Fine Arts, Navigation, Industry, Commerce and so on. He also executed two bronze lions for the building's access stairway in a more realistic manner. Ponzano made the tympanum of the portal for the church of St. Jerome in neo-medieval style. He was also responsible for decorating the auditorium of the Central University at San Bernardo in Madrid. The Lope de Vega Theater, Valladolid by architect Jerónimo de la Gándara, which was inaugurated on 8 December 1861, has a pediment that holds a medallion with the likeness of Lope de Vega sculpted by Ponciano Ponzano. He won many commissions for portraits. Some of these busts were more realistic because he was able to pay more attention to nature and was less distracted by representing a symbolic character. Examples are his busts of Dr. Eusebio Lera y Aznar and of José de Madrazo y Agudo. ==Gallery== File:Congreso de los Diputados (España) 05.jpgPartial view of the main façade of the Congress of Deputies in Madrid.

A question regarding the validity of the agreement arose during an International Court of Justice case that decided a boundary dispute between the two countries. The Maroua Declaration was signed on 1 June 1975 by Ahmadou Ahidjo, President of Cameroon, and Yakubu Gowon, the head of state of Nigeria in Maroua, Cameroon. The agreement extends a maritime boundary that previously existed between the two countries further into the Gulf of Guinea from the mouth of the Akwayafe River. In 2002, the International Court of Justice issued a judgment in a case between Cameroon and Nigeria on their longstanding boundary dispute. Nigeria argued that the Maroua Declaration was invalid and nonbinding because although the Nigerian head of state had signed it, the agreement had not been ratified either by Parliament or any other governmental process. The ICJ held that under international law the declaration was valid and came into effect upon signing by the head of state.Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v.

Strebel, April 5, 1966. ==Biography== He immigrated to the United States in 1834, entering the U.S. via the Port of Baltimore in October of that year. In November he went to New York City to fill the position of founding editor of the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung. The first issue was published about a month later, on Christmas Eve, 1834. He obtained sole ownership of the newspaper within a few years, possibly as early as 1837. That year he served as a delegate to a nationwide convention of German immigrants (held in Pittsburg) that considered the problems of adjusting to life in America. As owner and editor of the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, he built the paper from a weekly - printed on a manually operated Washington Hand Press - to a tri-weekly, and set the stage for daily publication. Although he sold ownership and publishing rights in 1845, just before the conversion to a daily, he continued as editor until 1853.An Epitome of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung's Sixty-Five Years of Progress. 1899.

He entered government service in 1854, and from then until 1866 filled various positions in the New York Custom House. During this period, he purchased a farm in the hamlet of Swamp Mills, Town of Tusten, Sullivan County, New York, to which he moved in 1866. Through his efforts, a fourth- class post office was established at Swamp Mills in 1873. Neumann was appointed postmaster, and set up the office in a portion of his house at the intersection of the Neumann-McHugh Road and the Mt.

It is the closing track of the band's debut album, Nowhere (1990), released on Creation Records, and was later released as a single in the United States in early 1991. Written by lead guitarist Andy Bell, the song features a distinctive swirling guitar riff, a strong, fill-based drum beat, and a coda that includes a string quartet. The song is the band's most well known and would later be voted number 145 on Pitchfork Media's Top 200 Tracks of the 90s.Pitchfork Top 200 Tracks of the 90s ==Composition== \\"Vapour Trail\\" is written in standard tuning, with the main riff constructed from a four chord pattern (C-sharp minor–B–A–E) which opens the song and repeats throughout, characterized by the distinct sound of two Rickenbacker 12-string guitars. The guitar sound on the song has been the subject of much debate. Fans have stated the use of compression, flanger, and chorus effects as the closest ways to emulate the trebly rhythm sound. However, according to Bell, no actual effects were used to achieve the sound, and that it was purely the two 12-strings guitars. Bell said of the song: > I remember writing the riff in a hotel room on a very early Ride tour. We > were in a bed and breakfast type scenario, and I was sitting on a bed with > an acoustic to get that four-chord pattern which is really very simple. It’s > played on two 12-strings. People seem to be quite interested with the guitar > sound on this record, if there are fades or effects, but there’s not; it’s > just two 12-strings. It’s just one of those magical songs. That’s the one > that everyone talks about on the album in my experience. These songs are the > easiest to write and the ones that you don’t really think about at the time. > It came out so easily and it has that effortless feel to it. I guess it is > the one I’m most proud of from that era. Played alongside the main guitar melody is a droning E power chord and a bassline consisting of the same chord sequence as the main riff. A heavy drum beat centered around fills and syncopation on the snare and tom-toms, a signature part of drummer Laurence \\"Loz\\" Colbert's style, is also a major force of the song's composition. After two verses and two choruses, the song closes with a nearly two-minute string-laden instrumental coda. The guitars, bass, and drums gradually fade out, leaving only the repeated violin and cello motif. Bell sings lead vocals on the song, something rare among the band's early material. ==Release and reception== \\"Vapour Trail\\" was featured as the closing track to Nowhere, released on 15 October 1990, although three tracks from the band's Fall EP were appended to CD releases of the album. Sire Records—which handled Creation's distribution in North America—released \\"Vapour Trail\\" as a CD single for the American market in April 1991. The single was essentially a re-hash of the band's Today Forever EP (which had not seen a US release), using the first three tracks as B-sides, as well as reusing the cover artwork. Despite the song's popularity, it failed to chart. Upon its release, \\"Vapour Trail\\" received critical acclaim. Pitchfork voted it as number 145 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s, and said that the song \\"remains immense, standing tall as the most gripping four-and-half-minutes of their career. Twenty years later, it's exciting to realize there's a lot more to be relished in between all its chimes.\\" The song is mentioned in the novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower as being a track on a mixtape the narrator makes for his friends entitled \\"One Winter\\". It also appeared as the end credit's song in Gregg Araki's Totally F***ed Up (1993) the first film of his Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Vapour Trail\\" was directed by Kevin Kerslake. Kerslake would later direct the video for \\"Leave Them All Behind\\". Both videos, along with the promo videos for \\"Chelsea Girl\\" and \\"Taste\\" would be featured on The Story of Creation VHS in 1992, as well as the Japanese Today Forever VHS. The video consists of grainy, slowed- down, color negative footage of the band in a small town.

He became the sole owner of Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.) two years later. In 1954, he began syndicating films to television through a.a.p., acquiring the entire library of 750 feature films of Warner Bros. made before 1950, as well as 1,500 short subjects and 337 Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts also from Warner Bros. and the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons from Paramount Pictures.

During the battle, American and Philippine forces recaptured the city of Baguio on the island of Luzon from a Japanese occupation force. One of the last tank engagements of the Philippine campaign took place during the battle. Baguio later became the scene of the final surrender of Japanese forces in the Philippines in September 1945. == Background == Prior to World War II, Baguio was the summer capital of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, as well as the home of the Philippine Military Academy. In 1939, the city had a population of 24,000 people, most of whom were Filipinos, along with other nationalities, including about 500 Japanese. Following the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, the Japanese used Camp John Hay, an American installation in Baguio, as a military base. In October 1944, American soldiers landed on Leyte, beginning the liberation of the Philippines. General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the commander of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army, transferred his headquarters to Baguio in December 1944, planning to fight a delaying action against the Americans to give time for Japan to defend itself. In early January 1945, American forces landed at Lingayen Gulf. Thereafter, the American Sixth Army conducted two campaigns, one against the Japanese forces east of Manila, and the second against Yamashita's forces in northern Luzon. == Campaign == Between late February and early April 1945, the Allied forces, primarily consisting of the United States Army's 33rd Infantry Division, with assistance from regiments of the Philippine guerrilla force United States Army Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon, advanced towards Baguio. By late March, the city was within range of American artillery. President José P. Laurel of the collaborationist Second Philippine Republic, having moved to Baguio from Manila in December 1944, departed Baguio on 22 March, reaching Taiwan on 30 March; the remainder of the Second Republic government in the Philippines, along with Japanese civilians, were ordered to evacuate Baguio on 30 March. Yamashita and his staff relocated to Bambang. A major offensive to capture Baguio did not occur until mid-April, when United States Army's 37th Infantry Division, minus the 145th Infantry Regiment, was released from garrisoning Manila to launch a two-division assault into Baguio from the west and south. During the Allied drive towards Baguio from the west, a six-day battle was fought at Irisan Gorge and the nearby Irisan River. This battle involved one of the last tank-versus-tank engagements of the Philippines campaign, between M4 Shermans of the U.S. Army's Company B, 775th Tank Battalion and Type 97s of the IJA's 5th Tank Company, 10th Tank Regiment. In mid-April, 7,000 civilians, including foreign nationals, made their way from Baguio to American lines. Among them were five cabinet members of the Second Republic; Brigadier General Manuel Roxas was \\"freed\\", the other four were captured as collaborators. On 22 April, Major General Noakata Utsunomiya, who had been left in command of the defense of Baguio by Yamashita, ordered a withdrawal from Baguio. On 24 April, the first Allied forces – a patrol of the 129th Infantry Regiment – entered Baguio. == Aftermath == General Yamashita (center, on the near side of the table) at the surrender ceremony at Camp John Hay on 3 September 1945. Yamashita, along with 50,500 men of the Shobu Group, held out against the American advance in northern Luzon until 15 August 1945. On 3 September 1945, one day after the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay, Yamashita formally surrendered Japanese forces in the Philippines at Camp John Hay's American Residence in the presence of lieutenant-generals Arthur Percival and Jonathan Wainwright. == References  External links== *U.S. Army footage of the battle of Baguio via Archive.org Category:1945 in the Philippines Baguio 1945 Baguio 1945 Baguio 1945 Baguio 1945 Category:History of Baguio Category:Tank battles involving Japan Category:Tank battles of World War II ","title":"Battle of Baguio (1945)"},{"id":"35957782","text":"Prospect Hill (also known as the Littlepage Inn) is a plantation house in Spotsylvania County, Virginia.

Waller purchased land around Prospect Hill beginning in 1803 using an inheritance from his half-brother, General Lewis Littlepage. One of the original outbuildings housed the first post office in Spotsylvania in 1809. Holladay and his wife, Huldah, raised 13 children at Prospect hill. One of their sons, James Holladay, was captured at the Battle of Five Forks during the American Civil War - just days before the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House. When he was released, James returned to the plantation and restored it to operation. In the 1880s he added a porch surrounding the first floor. This was the only addition to Prospect Hill until 1991. Prospect Hill underwent restoration between 1991 and 1996. The restoration was done by Holladay family members - descendants of Waller and Huldah Holladay.

His involvement in Athenian politics helped pave the way for the rule of the Four Hundred following the Athenian coup of 411 BCE.Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002; pp. 102–103 Clitophon also appears in the writing of Plato, and presents a philosophy of \\"thoroughgoing normative relativism\\" in a brief role in the Republic.Plato, Republic, 340b ==Life== Little is known of Clitophon's early life. His participation in Athenian government reform following the calamitous Sicilian Expedition of 413 BCE dates his birth to 452 or earlier, as the council assembled to do so of which he was a part was composed of men aged over forty. The Constitution of Athens attributed to Aristotle names Clitophon as an early proponent of a return to the ancestral constitution (patrios politeia),Ps.-Aristotle, Constitution of Athens, 29.3 a decisive move towards the oligarchy of the Four Hundred. The work also records his later serving as an ambassador to Lysander in 404,Ps.-Aristotle, Constitution of Athens, 34.3 representing a brand of moderate oligarchy associated with figures like Theramenes. ==In literature== Plato depicts Clitophon as a close associate with the sophistic rhetorician Thrasymachus and the orator Lysias. Clitophon assists the former in Book 1 of Plato's Republic, positing a brief but significant relativistic argument that the advantage of the stronger is identical to whatever the stronger believes it to be. In the potentially apocryphal Platonic dialogue that bears his name he appears as a disgruntled student of Socrates, whom he attacks for the impracticality of, and lack of positive knowledge found in, the Socratic method. The comedic playwright Aristophanes also paired Clitophon alongside Theramenes and parodied the two for their political fickleness in the Frogs.Aristophanes, Frogs, 965-7 ==See also== *List of speakers in Plato's dialogues ==References== Category:5th-century BC Athenians Category:Athenians of the Peloponnesian War Category:Pupils of Socrates Category:Oligarchs ","title":"Clitophon (Athenian)"},{"id":"35957830","text":"John Allday may refer to: * John Alday, 16th-century English translator * John Allday (explorer), 16th-century English captain who explored Greenland for the king of Denmark-Norway in 1579, see List of Arctic expeditions * John Allday (Coxswain) fictional character in the 1800 Richard Bolitho novels by Douglas Reeman ","title":"John Allday"},{"id":"35957849","text":"Jean Henri Becays Ferrand or Jean Marie Begais Ferrand de la Caussade (10 September 1736 - 28 November 1805) became a French general officer early in the French Revolutionary Wars and led troops during two early actions.

It was built in 1946 as an addition to a roadside restaurant and filling station, both of which are now gone. The site's Munger-Moss Sandwich Shop served travellers on U.S. Route 66 in Missouri, circa 1936. Located on the Big Piney River at Devil's Elbow, Missouri until 1945 (at what is now the Elbow Inn), it relocated to Lebanon, Missouri after World War II when construction of a four-lane bypass of U.S. Route 66 in Missouri to Fort Leonard Wood drew traffic away from the original Munger Moss BBQ site. ==History== The restaurant was named for Nelle Munger, its original owner, and her second husband Emmett Moss. This name was retained after the business was sold to Pete and Jesse Hudson in 1945, relocated to the former Chicken Shanty site in Lebanon in September 1945 and expanded with tourist cabins in 1946. The current owners purchased the motel in June 1971. Statuary in the motel garden The lodgings were originally constructed as a 14-room cabin court, an early motel-like accommodation in which each pair of rooms stood as a free-standing building with carports in the middle. Much as cabins and motor courts replaced the campgrounds that had served Depression- era motorists, motels with multiple rooms in one building would replace individual cabins in the 1950s. Space initially allocated to individual carports or open ground between cabins would soon be filled with additional rooms. While the post-war era brought a huge increase in tourism as auto manufacturers returned to civilian production and wartime rationing of fuel and tires ended, the 1950s would also bring increased competition both from other independents and from chains such as Holiday Inn (founded 1952 in Memphis, Tennessee). The aggressively-expanding motel would add elaborate neon signage to rival the chain motel's Great Sign, in-room televisions, air conditioning and an outdoor swimming pool to remain competitive. When U.S. Route 66 was upgrade to a four-lane highway in 1957 and ultimately bypassed by the parallel Interstate 44 in Missouri, all small independent motorist- oriented businesses were adversely affected to varying degrees. The Stony Dell Resort in Arlington became a ghost resort in a ghost town while John's Modern Cabins were abandoned and continue to deteriorate as a ghost tourist court. Munger-Moss was more fortunate; its location was one where Interstate 44 closely paralleled US 66 and the closest off-ramp was within a half-mile of the motel. While freeway construction represented disruption, the Munger Moss remained in continuous operation as an independent local motel and added 26 more units in 1961. It currently has 44 rooms and 16 efficiencies. In 2010, its neon signage was restored using a $10300 National Park Service matching grant as part of larger US route 66 historic corridor preservation efforts. ==See also== * List of motels == References == Devil's Elbow restaurant is now Elbow Inn.

It is about a successful shoe designer in her late 30s whose career is sidetracked when she accidentally becomes pregnant. The series aired on MBC from May 30 to July 19, 2012 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. ==Plot== Hwang Ji-ahn is in her late thirties and works as a director of a shoe company. She likes being single and has no plans to get married. Meanwhile, Tae-kang only has a high school diploma but wants a career as a shoe designer. After a one- night stand, Tae-kang gets Ji-ahn pregnant and their lives become entangled. Fighting against rigid social mores, the two of them try to navigate a messy and challenging world. But these two people persevere despite the obstacles before them, searching for true happiness despite living in a society where morally acceptable behavior is in constant flux. ==Cast and characters== * Kim Sun-a as Hwang Ji-ahn In her late thirties, she is a director at popular shoe company. To her the world is either black and white while grey areas are unacceptable. She is spunky, curt, authoritarian, hard-charging and susceptible to having hysterical fits when she is under stress. Since she was young, she had an unexplainable affection for shoes. Even when she would just throw on tracksuit pants and wear no makeup, she made sure she always wore the right shoes. Her love for shoes naturally led her to join a shoe company. Working harder and more passionately than anyone else, she was promoted to the position of director. But a one-night stand is about to throw a wrench in her immaculate and perfect life. * Lee Jang-woo as Park Tae-kang In his twenties, he vowed to become rich within ten years. But he only has a high school diploma, works as a seller of counterfeit luxury shoes, and constantly runs away from the police during crackdowns on illicit goods. But he believes that he has to maintain his cool style. And he invests a lot of time on networking to get a big break. By a stroke of luck, he is hired by a chaebol firm as a shoe designer. Compared to the other designers, he has no training, experience or family money. Work becomes a challenge. On top of this, he finds himself entangled with Ji-ahn who is an older woman with a bad temper... * Park Gun- hyung as Jo Eun-sung He is a charming gynecologist and highly eligible bachelor. Everybody in his family are doctors and he was under pressure to go to medical school. Although he is in his late thirties, he leads the lifestyle of a typical 20-year-old hipster. So hardly anyone perceives him as a married man who has settled down with a family. He wants to keep dating girls without settling down with one woman. So he has chosen to live as a bachelor. But then he meets Ji-ahn on an arranged date and becomes interested in her when she makes up a story about how she has early menopause to turn him off. * Im Soo- hyang as Yeom Na-ri / Jang Na-ri Youngest daughter of the chairman of Hanyoung Apparel. She graduated with top honors from the S-Mode Institute and currently holds the title of vice president at her father's company. She has pretty looks, a stellar academic background, and a wealthy dad. In effect, she has it all. But she was the daughter of her father's mistress so she had to live in the shadows while growing up. Deep inside, she has a vulnerable heart but on the surface, she is blunt, cold, feisty and unfazed by anything. Nobody dares to anger her. With her father's support, she is on course to succeed him as his successor but she finds herself competing with her rival, Ji-ahn. So she plans on getting rid of her at the company. * Park Yeong-gyu as Park Kwang- seok (Tae-kang's father) * Yoon Joo-sang as Ji-ahn's father * Shin Seung-hwan as Lee Choong-baek * Jo Hee-bong as Seol Bong-soo * Kim Hye-eun as Bong Joon- hee * Oh Mi-yeon as Ji-ahn's mother * Oh Mi-hee as Lady Jang * Lee Dae-yeon as President Yeom * Kim Beom-yong as Song Ha-yoon * Baek Seung-hee as Uhm Yoo-jin * Kim Min-hee as Ma Seong-mi * Han Ji-wan as Yoo Da-in ==Production== Ji-ahn's extravagant walk-in shoe closet was custom-made for the drama, with the shoes inside plus those located in the character's company and office amounting to a total of 500 pairs of footwear worth . Ji-ahn's chic fashion style has also become trend-setting, increasing the demand for the brands the character uses in the drama, as well as her bob hairstyle. According to wardrobe stylist Kim Young-joo, some of the credit belongs to actress Kim Sun-a, who gave her input during their fashion concept meetings.

His career extended from 1890 to 1934 and he was responsible for important innovations in water and wastewater treatment. He designed and built the first modern water filtration plant, and he designed and built the first chlorination system that disinfected a U.S. drinking water supply. In addition, he performed groundbreaking engineering work on sewage treatment facilities in the U.S. He was President of both the American Water Works Association and the American Public Health Association, and he was recognized internationally as an expert civil and sanitary engineer. ==Early life and education== George W. Fuller was born in Franklin, Massachusetts in 1868. After his primary and secondary education, he was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the age of 16. He deferred his attendance at MIT for one year (beginning 1886) due to the death of his father. At MIT, he studied under William T. Sedgwick and completed his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1890. Sedgwick was able to send Fuller to Berlin, Germany to study under the chief engineer for the Berlin waterworks, Carl Piefke. During his stay in Berlin, Fuller studied bacteriology at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Berlin.“Sad Milestone in Sanitary Engineering Progress.” (1934). American Journal of Public Health. 24:8, 895-6. ==Career== After returning from Berlin, Fuller started working at the Lawrence Experiment Station in Lawrence, Massachusetts while still under the tutelage of William T. Sedgwick. While at LES, he investigated the treatment of sewage using filtration systems. His most important work was the study of filtration for potable water treatment. His early investigations were designed to increase the filtration rate for slow sand filters so that water treatment facilities could be built on smaller land footprints and, thus, be constructed more economically.“George W. Fuller.” (1935). Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 100: 1653-60. ===Louisville and Cincinnati filtration studies=== During the period 1895 to 1897, Fuller was hired by the City of Louisville, Kentucky to study water filtration processes for the purpose of purifying Ohio River water for human consumption. The focus of his investigations were on \\"mechanical filtration\\" treatment systems (also called rapid sand filtration), which used filtration rates that were 60 times higher than those of slow sand filters. Aluminum sulfate was added prior to filtration to form larger particles that would be amenable to filtration. The work in Louisville made it clear that except for the clearest upland water supplies, a sedimentation treatment step would have to be added prior to filtration to remove the bulk of the suspended particulate matter.Fuller, George W. (1898). Report on the Investigations into the Purification of the Ohio River Water at Louisville Kentucky: Made to the President and Directors of the Louisville Water Company. New York:Van Nostrand. Fuller learned from his Louisville work when he designed the investigations at Cincinnati, Ohio for the purification of Ohio River water. From 1897 to 1899, Fuller investigated mechanical filtration using the addition of aluminum sulfate followed by a sedimentation step before the final filtration process.Fuller, George W. (1899). Report on the Investigations into the Purification of the Ohio River Water for the Improved Water Supply of the City of Cincinnati. Cincinnati:City of Cincinnati. ===Water purification=== After completing the Cincinnati filtration report, Fuller opened a single person consulting practice in New York City. One of his first assignments was from the East Jersey Water Company to design a 30 million gallon per day mechanical filtration plant at Little Falls, New Jersey. The plant was a milestone in public health protection because it incorporated all of Fuller's findings from his research over the previous 10 years and it became the model for the design of subsequent drinking water filtration facilities. Death rates for typhoid fever in the U.S. 1906–1960 On June 19, 1908, Fuller was hired by John L. Leal to design and build a chlorination system for the Jersey City, New Jersey water supply at Boonton Reservoir on the Rockaway River. Given an impossible deadline as a result of a New Jersey Chancery Court order, Fuller successfully completed the chlorination system in 99 days. John L. Leal developed the basic concept of applying chlorine in the form of a dilute solution of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at fractions of a ppm.Baker, Moses N. (1981). The Quest for Pure Water: the History of Water Purification from the Earliest Records to the Twentieth Century. 2nd Edition. Vol. 1. Denver: American Water Works Association, 336. Fuller modeled his chloride of lime feed system on the aluminum sulfate feed system that he designed for the Little Falls Water Treatment Plant. The chlorination facility fed 0.2 to 0.35 ppm of chlorine to an average water flow of 40 million gallons per day from Boonton Reservoir.McGuire, Michael J. (2013). The Chlorine Revolution: Water Disinfection and the Fight to Save Lives. Denver, CO:American Water Works Association.Fuller, George W. (1909). “Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir.” Proceedings American Water Works Association. 110-34. Fuller testified as an expert witness for the defendants, the Jersey City Water Supply Company, in both trials that resulted from a lawsuit filed by Jersey City against the water company.Between the Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, Complainant, and Patrick H. Flynn and Jersey City Water Supply Company, Defendants: On Bill, etc. (In Chancery of New Jersey) 12 vols. n.p.:privately printed. 1908-10, 1-6987. The chlorination system that he designed and built was declared a success by the Special Master, William J. Magie, and was judged capable of supplying Jersey City with water that was \\"pure and wholesome.\\"Magie, William J. (1910). In Chancery of New Jersey: Between the Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, Complainant, and the Jersey City Water Supply Co., Defendant. Report for Hon. W.J. Magie, special master on cost of sewers, etc., and on efficiency of sterilization plant at Boonton, Press Chronicle Co., Jersey City, New Jersey, (Case Number 27/475-Z-45-314), 1-15. The success of the Boonton chlorination system was due, in no small part, to the engineering excellence of Fuller. Chlorine use exploded after the positive ruling by Justice Magie and typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases were conquered as a direct result of Fuller's reliable engineering of the first chlorination system. ===Sewage treatment=== The foundation of Fuller's expertise in sewage treatment was laid at the Lawrence Experiment Station in Massachusetts. He later went on to design and supervise the construction of some of the most important sewage treatment plants in the U.S. Fuller and his partner Rudolph Hering were responsible for the design of the earliest Imhoff tank sewage treatment facilities in the U.S., which were located in Chatham, New Jersey and Atlanta, Georgia.“George W. Fuller: Industry Pioneer.” (2003). Water Engineering Management. 23 (May): 10-11. He wrote two books that defined the state-of-the-art of sewage treatment.Fuller, George W. (1912). Sewage Disposal. New York: McGraw- Hill.Fuller, George W. (1926). and James R. McClintock. Solving Sewage Problems. New York: McGraw-Hill. At the time of his death, an activated sludge system that he designed was being constructed on Wards Island to handle sewage flows from New York City.\\"George Warren Fuller.\\" (1999). American National Biography. John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes eds. Vol.10. New York:Oxford. 145-7. ===Consulting firms=== Fuller was a consultant to cities, water agencies and sewer authorities for 34 years. * Single practice, 1899–1901 * Hering and Fuller, 1901–1911 * Fuller and McClintock, 1911–1934 It is estimated that Fuller acted as a consultant to over 150 municipalities and agencies during his career. Besides the design and construction of the Little Falls Treatment Plant, Fuller worked for the cities of New York, Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Kansas City, MO, and many others. ==Personal life== Fuller was married four times. * Lucy Hunter, married 1888, deceased 1895, one child: Myron E. Fuller * Caroline L. Goodloe, married 1899, deceased 1907, two children: John Kemp Goodloe Fuller and Asa W. Fuller * Charlotte Bell Todd, married 1913, divorced 1918 * Eleanor Todd Burt, married 1918, adopted three sons by Eleanor: Kenneth B. Fuller, Gordon B. Fuller and George B. Fuller ==Professional Associations== Fuller belonged to over a dozen professional associations during his career. Some of his most important contributions were made while a member of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Public Health Association (APHA). As part of APHA, he was a member of the early water bacteriology committees that developed standards for the isolation, enumeration and identification of bacteria in water. This early work led to the development of the first edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater which is now jointly published by APHA, AWWA and the Water Environment Federation and is in its 22nd edition. In AWWA he was primarily responsible for the creation of standards of practice which ultimately developed into the AWWA Standards Council which manages standards for chemicals, pipe, and treatment equipment used throughout the world. In recognition of his lifetime of service to the water works profession, AWWA created the George Warren Fuller Award in 1937. The recipients of the award are chosen annually by the Sections of AWWA, and they are selected based on their contributions to the advancement of waterworks practices.“George Warren Fuller Award.” (1949).

The favorite grandson of Emperor Pedro II, he was known as \\"the Preferred\\" (). ==BiographyFamily and early years=== Prince Pedro Augusto aged 11, 1877 The eldest son of Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and of Dona Princess Leopoldina of Brazil, Princess of Brazil, Dom Pedro Augusto was also the first grandson of Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil and Empress Teresa Cristina. His paternal grandparents were Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Clémentine of Orléans (daughter of King Louis Philippe of France).Wehrs, 277 Due to the lack of heirs by the Princess Imperial and the miscarriage suffered by Dona Leopoldina in her first pregnancy, there were high expectations surrounding the birth of Dom Pedro Augusto.Del Piore, 30 On the eve of the birth, the council of ministers as well as representatives of the legislative, the Grandees of the Empire and the entire diplomatic corps were alerted to the big event. Pedro Augusto was born at 16:10 of March 19th, 1866, at the Leopoldina Hall; his birth was announced with three rockets fired from the Imperial Palace of São Cristóvão, followed by volleys of guns of the forts and ships anchored in the bar.Bragança, 286Del Priore, 17 The baptism was held in April in the Imperial Chapel. In the Speech from the Throne on May 3 of that year, the emperor made reference to the happy event. By virtue of the marriage contract between Princess Leopoldina and Prince Ludwig August, the couple undertook to reside part of the year in Brazil as the emperor did not consider the succession of Princess Isabel as assured.Bragança (1959), 75 Dom Pedro Augusto spent part of his early childhood in Brazil and part in Europe.Defrance, 213, 216-217 A few weeks after the birth of her fourth and last son, Dom Luís Gastão, Dona Leopoldina contracted typhoid fever and died in Vienna on February 7, 1871, at twenty-three years of age. That same year, the Imperial couple made their first visit to Europe, where a family council decided that Dom Pedro Augusto and his brother, Dom Augusto Leopoldo, would return to Brazil to be raised by his maternal grandparents.Lessa, 123Defrance, 209-210Bragança (1966), 205 At the request of the Emperor, doctor Manuel Pacheco da Silva (the future Baron of Pacheco) left his position as dean of Externato Dom Pedro II to become tutor to the Emperor's grandchildren, because they \\"(...) are lagging badly in speaking Portuguese, only know the German language.\\" At the age of eight, the young prince was enrolled at the Imperial College of Pedro II, becoming a Bachelor of Science and Letters in 1881. On April 1, 1887, he graduated in Civil Engineering from Polytechnical School, having already delivered a lecture on Académie des Sciences.Defrance, 300 A scholar like his grandfather, Pedro Augusto was a member of the Institut de France and author of several works on mineralogy, taken today as gems.Lessa, 124 ===The imperial succession=== Prince Pedro Augusto with his maternal grandparents, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil and Empress Teresa Cristina, 1887 The apparent infertility of Princess Dona Isabel meant that Pedro Augusto was considered the heir apparent since the day of his birth. However, at nine years of age, the prince found himself sliding down in the line of succession, due to the birth of his cousin Dom Pedro de Alcântara, who held the title of Prince of Grão-Pará.Mello Jr, 217 This change of circumstances is said to have affected the behaviour of Pedro Augusto considerably.Del Priore, 62 After the birth of his cousin and throughout his adolescence, the prince suffered from insomnia, intense headaches, palpitations, and hand tremors. His recurring fear of death (fearing to be infected with the same disease that killed his mother) became a source of concern for his father.Del Priore, 63 Installed in Leopoldina Palace, an annex residence of the Palace of São Cristóvão, the prince became quite popular, holding receptions and banquets, even to the point of forming an informal court around him. The sums of money which he required from his father increased considerably, leading Luís Augusto asking for explanations from the emperor.Del Priore, 70 The preference of the emperor for his eldest grandson caused jealousy in the imperial princess and fed the speculation about a turnaround in the line of succession. Diplomatic correspondences allow an insight into family divisions. The alleged religious fanaticism and the policies of Dona Isabel ended up creating a climate in which a faction of the elite favoured a future Third Reign by Dom Pedro Augusto.Del Priore, 67-69 The \\"Conspirator Prince\\", as he was called in Parliament, had, according to his contemporaries, active participation in the campaign that intended to promote him to the throne instead of his aunt and cousin. His greatest mentor in these affairs, and one of its most enthusiastic promoters, was the counselor Sousa Dias, president of the council of ministers between 1884 and 1885.Del Priore, 73 In Europe, where he was with his grandparents between 1887 and 1888, Eduardo Prado and Baron Star were propagating his virtues in contrast to the \\"defects\\" of Dona Isabel.Del Priore, 102 Indeed, on his European tour, in all countries and royal houses he visited, Dom Pedro Augusto was received with the pomp worthy of an heir to the throne. His popularity grew by leaps and bounds. In France he received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor; in Portugal, King Dom Luís I awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.Del Priore, 124 His return to Brazil deepened the silent crisis within the Brazilian Imperial Family. Support for the prince grew in number and political weight: Baron Maya Monteiro, Count de Figueiredo, the Marquis of Paranaguá - among other leading politicians - and even the empress herself became his partisans.Del Priore, 132, 150 ===Republic and exile=== Prince Pedro Augusto in exile in Paris, 1890 Dom Pedro Augusto learned of the military coup that resulted in the Proclamation of the Republic hours after the incident, when returning from a horseback ride. Forced by the provisional government to go into exile, on November 17, at dawn, all members of the Imperial family - with the exception of Dom Augusto, who was in circumnavigation with the Imperial Navy in the East - boarded the steamer Alagoas and were escorted by the battleship Riachuelo up to the limits of the Brazilian territorial waters.Del Priore, 218-219 It was aboard the Alagoas that Prince had his first psychotic break-down: he tried to strangle the captain, accusing him of having taken a bribe in order to kill everyone on board.Del Priore, 219 Restrained and locked in his cabin, he was stricken with persecutory delusions, and ended up wrapping his body in a lifeguard buoy, fearing that the ship was being bombed. With alternating phases of excitement and lethargy, Pedro Augusto threw bottles overboard with requests for help. There are records of at least one of these messages, found in a bottle on Maragogi beach. Having arrived in his European exile, Pedro Augusto was taken for psychiatric treatment in Graz (Austria). A few weeks later he was discharged and met with his grandparents when they received the news of the death of Dona Teresa Cristina, the only family ally in his pretensions to the throne. With the move of the family to Cannes, he contacted old supporters and tried to plan the monarchical restoration in Brazil. However, his psychological situation deteriorated further, and the few monarchists still active soon withdrew their support from the prince.Del Priore, 240-243 ===Madness and death=== St. Augustine's Church in Coburg, Germany. Having been abandoned by the \\"pedristas\\", Pedro Augusto's psychiatric symptoms progressively worsened. His nights were sleepless, he did not eat, and he began babbling incomprehensible words or ranting against imaginary enemies. Often the servants of the Coburg Palace found him huddled in a corner with a glazed look and foaming at the mouth. The few remaining friends tried in vain to help him. At the request of the physician Jean Charcot, the young man was examined by the famous Sigmund Freud, as evidenced by Augusto Leopoldo in a letter to the Baron de Santa Vitória: Although his health showed signs of recovery, monarchists ended up investing their hopes and support in his brother as pretender to the throne. With the death of Dom Pedro II, on December 5, 1891, melancholy and mania returned. Pedro Augusto accused his aunt and uncle, Princess Isabel and the Count d'Eu, of spreading rumours about his sanity; and he accused journalists of casting doubts on his masculinity.Del Priore, 252 In October 1893, articles published in French and Argentine newspapers recognized the status of his cousin Dom Pedro de Alcântara as the rightful claimant to the imperial throne.Del Priore, 246-247 This led Pedro Augusto to the brink of collapse, and his old delusions returned. After being restrained and sent to the Coburg Palace again, he attempted suicide by throwing himself through one of the windows of his room.Del Priore, 257-258 Admitted by his father to a sanatorium in Tulln an der Donau, \\"The Preferred\\" spent the rest of his life believing that he would one day become Emperor of Brazil. On April 25, 1900, all of his personal belongings were auctioned off in Vienna.Bragança (2004), 205 The prince died on July 7, 1934, at the age of 68 and after over four decades of hospitalization.Del Priore, 259Affonso Celso, 429-430Bragança (2004), 207-208 His body was buried in the crypt of the Sankt-Augustin-Kirche in Coburg. == Titles and honors  Titles and styles === * 19 March 1866 – 6 July 1934: His Highness Prince Pedro Augusto of Brazil, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of SaxonyBragança (1959), 87Bragança (1959), 90 ===Honours=== Prince Pedro Augusto was a recipient of the following orders:Bragança (2008), 166 ;Brazilian honours 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Pedro I 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Rose ;Foreign honours 50px Grand Cross of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order, 1884 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, 21 July 1887 50px Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword, 26 July 1888 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold 50px Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour 50px Grand Cross of the Order of St. Alexander ==AncestryBibliography== * Bragança, Dom Carlos Tasso de Saxe-Coburgo e.

DAOM also has a women's rugby team competing in \\"Torneo Femenino\\" organised by the same body. ==History== The club was founded in 1927 by workers and employees of the \\"Preservation Section and Tramway of Buenos Aires\\", a division area of the Municipality of Buenos Aires. The institution was primarily named as \\"Club Atlético Conservación y Tranvías\\". After being founded, the members of the club searched for a place where to settle. After visiting many places within the city of Buenos Aires, they finally chose a land located in the intersection of Varela and Castañares streets, at the South East of the city. Once the land was acquired, the club members started to work in the construction of the facilities, being helped by the Municipality which collaborated with the project. The first step was to build a football field and its changing room, and other minor buildings. In 1936 the club changed its name to \\"Club Ente Autónomo de Industria Municipal\\", which lasted until 1943 when the acronym DAOM (which referred to \\"Dirección Autárquica de Obras Municipales\\") was approved as the definitive name of the institution. From 1943 to date DAOM has built the swimming pool, the gym and fields for different sports. DAOM was also a pioneer of baseball in Argentina, being the first club to have a baseball-specific stadium in the country.Historia - DAOM rugby Baseball started to be practised at DAOM in 1947. Two years later the Argentine Baseball and Softball League was created and soon organized a first division championship. Some of the institutions invited to the tournament were Gimnasia y Esgrima and DAOM. A second division (formed by the same teams taking part at primera) was also created to increase the level of the tournaments. DAOM won its first title in 1951, the second disputed by the team. The institution has won a large number of championships since then, becoming one of the most successful baseball clubs of Argentina. ==References * Official website d d D d d d d d d ","title":"Club DAOM"},{"id":"35958214","text":"Hamid Ghassemi-Shall () (born circa 1967) is an Iranian-Canadian computer technician who was arrested by Iran on espionage charges in 2008 and sentenced to death the following year. The Canadian government and senate have called for a stay of execution, and Amnesty International began a letter-writing campaign on his behalf. ==Background== Born in Iran, Ghassemi-Shall moved to Canada in 1990 following the Islamic Revolution. He holds citizenship in both countries. He met his future wife, Italian-Canadian Antonella Mega, in 1995 while working at a shoe store in Toronto, and married her within the year. ==Espionage conviction== Ghassemi-Shall traveled to Iran in May 2008 to visit his mother, who was unwell. He had last traveled to the country in 2004, on the first anniversary of his father's death. While Ghassemi-Shall was in Iran, his older brother Alborz was arrested, and Ghassemi-Shall's Canadian passport was seized along with other family documents. Ghassem-Shall reported to the police station at the end of the month to retrieve his passport, but was also arrested. In late 2009, Ghassemi-Shall was convicted of espionage for Mujahideen e-Khalq (MEK). The basis of the charge was an e-mail he allegedly sent to Alborz requesting information on the MEK's behalf. Ghassemi-Shall's family has denied that such an e-mail was written or sent. Initially told his sentence would be life imprisonment, Ghassemi-Shall was later sentenced to death by an Iranian court. Alborz died in Evin prison in January 2010. Iranian authorities attributed the death to stomach cancer, while a Toronto Sun reporter called the circumstances of the death \\"mysterious\\". According to Ghassemi-Shall's wife, he spent nineteen months in solitary confinement and had been physically abused by his guards. Despite his dual citizenship, he was also denied visits from the Canadian consulate. In April 2012, Ghassemi- Shall's sister was told that his execution was imminent. Persian media sources reported on September 23, 2013 that Ghassemi-Shall was released after his sentence was reduced from death to five years imprisonment. He was released after having served five years and four months, and returned to Canada on October 10.http://www.amnesty.ca/our-work/good-news/hamid-ghassemi-shall-has- been-releasedhttp://www.amnesty.ca/news/news-releases/amnesty-international- greets-hamid-ghassemi-shall-back-to-canada == Campaigns on Ghassemi-Shall's behalf == Ghassesmi-Shall's wife Antonella Mega has traveled around Canada to speak in her husband's support. As of May 2012, she had applied for an Iranian visa to travel to Tehran to plead for his compassionate release. Ghassemi- Shall has also been the subject of several viral social media campaigns. In April 2012, Amnesty International began a letter-writing campaign on Ghassemi- Shall's behalf, urging the Iranian government to halt his execution; grant him access to his family, a lawyer, and medical treatment; and retry him in accordance with international norms for a fair trial. In a February 2012 debate, Canadian senator Linda Frum expressed concern for Ghassemi-Shall's case, stating that he had \\"endured 18 months of solitary confinement and has been subjected to physical and psychological torture\\". Following reports that Ghassemi-Shall's execution was impending, Prime Minister Stephen Harper threatened the Iranian government with \\"consequences\\" if Ghassemi-Shall was killed, saying: \\"the government of Iran should know that the whole world will be watching, and they will cast judgement if terrible and inappropriate things are done in this case.\\" Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird and Minister of State of Foreign Affairs Diane Ablonczy stated that \\"Canada urgently appeals to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to grant clemency to Mr Ghassemi-Shall on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. We urge Iran to reverse its current course and to adhere to its international human rights obligations.\\" The House of Commons of Canada issued a unanimous call for his release on May 30. His sentence was also protested by the U.S., U.K., Brazil, and Turkey. However, the Canadian government reportedly wielded little influence in Iran after the 2003 death of journalist Zahra Kazemi worsened relations between the two countries. A columnist for The Globe and Mail described Ghassemi-Shall as a \\"hostage\\" taken by the Iranian government for unclear demands. Royal Military College Iranian studies expert Houchang Hassan-Yari described the Ghassemi-Shall's arrest as a \\"pressure tactic\\" by the Iranian government in retaliation for criticism by Canada of Iran's record on human rights. == See also == *Canada–Iran relations *List of foreign nationals detained in Iran *Saeed Malekpour ==References== Category:Living people Category:Canadian people imprisoned abroad Category:Iranian emigrants to Canada Category:Iranian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Iran Category:1970s births Category:Salespeople Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Iran Category:People convicted of espionage in Iran ","title":"Hamid Ghassemi-Shall"},{"id":"35958224","text":"Oh Ban-Suk (; born 20 May 1988) is a South Korean footballer who plays as a Centre-back for Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors.

O'Brien is most notable for her 1943 comic strip, Wanda the War Girl, the first Australian comic strip to present an account of life during and after World War II from a female perspective. ==Biography== Kathleen Mary O'Brien was born in Mackay, Queensland (in her grandfather's hotel) on 18 October 1914, the daughter of Patrick and Kathleen Mary O'Brien. As a young girl, she travelled all over Australia with her parents, whilst her father prospected for gold, broke horses and worked in the outback. Her mother's interest in art inspired her to become an artist. O'Brien boarded at a Brisbane convent and studied art at the Brisbane Central Technical College, before moving to Sydney in 1937, where she studied for three years with noted Australian artist J.S. (John Samuel) Watkins (1866–1942). In 1942 the editor of The Sunday Telegraph, Cyril Pearl, was looking for a new strip to replace Mary and Elizabeth Durack's Nungulla and Jungalla. Journalist, Bob Slessor, suggested to O'Brien that she think about coming up with something. Her idea was a girl in the armed services, Pearl liked the samples and asked her to prepare a strip for the paper. Wanda was a tough independent young, long-legged curveous redhead, whose series of adventures had her encountering Japanese soldiers and German spies. The early stories were written by journalist, Clifford William Brain, but O'Brien took over the writing of the strip after the war. Professor Jane Chapman, in her 2011 lecture at Macquarie University, considers that Wanda was inspired by Tarpé Mills' comic strip, Black Fury (a syndicated American strip, which appeared in The Sunday Telegraph) and Jane by Norman Pett (which appeared in the UK Daily Mirror). According to John Ryan in his Australian Comic anthology, Panel by Panel, \\"O'Brien developed an unique style which resembled some of the work of William Dobell.\\" Wanda the War Girl first appeared in The Sunday Telegraph on 18 July 1943. Wanda was reputed to be more popular with school children than Superman. Wanda also had a similar appeal with servicemen, with her image often painted on the sides of tanks and planes. After the end of the Second World War the strip was renamed Wanda and took on the mantle of an adventure/detective strip before it was abruptly terminated mid-story on 25 November 1991. O'Brien basing her storylines on books by Ashton Wolfe, the head of the French Sûreté, combining methods he detailed with current newspaper stories, thus Wanda was involved in struggles with black-marketeers, foreign spies and smugglers. The strip was subsequently collected into several comic books. Wanda the War Girl was published as a one- shot by Consolidated Press, whilst The Wanda Comic was the first and the fifth in Consolidated Press' Supercomic Series. At the same time O'Brien worked as a commercial artist and book illustrator, illustrating twelve books, including Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid (1943), Australia's first unabridged version of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (1943), Ella Greenway's Peter Cat (1950) and Nourma Handford's Carloola Backstage: A Career Novel for Girls' (1956). In 1947 she married Robert Blanche. O'Brien briefly taught art at Springwood Ladies College and had a notable career as a fashion artist. O'Brien's illustrations appearing in advertisements for Myer, David Jones, Georges and Farmers department stores. Kathleen O'Brien (Blanche) died in her Hazelbrook home on 8 May 1991. ==ReferencesCategory:Australian comic strip cartoonists Category:Australian illustrators Category:Australian comics artists Category:Australian cartoonists Category:People from Mackay, Queensland Category:1914 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Australian comics writers Category:Australian women cartoonists Category:Australian women illustrators Category:Australian women writers Category:Australian female comics artists Category:Female comics writers ","title":"Kathleen O'Brien"},{"id":"35958298","text":"William S.

J. Seymour's Kyk-Over- Al in British Guiana in 1945. According to the Barbados National Register, on the submission of 16 volumes of BIM magazine together with the associated Frank Collymore Collection of correspondence in 2008: :\\"The importance of the magazine is that it provides a miniature history of primary sources in West Indian literature. In the mid twentieth century the magazine fostered the idea, new in the region at that time, that the profession of writing is an honorable one. The magazine was the chief meeting place for Anglophone literary ideas thus enabling the writers to overcome their isolation. Bim provided also an opportunity for new writers to appear in print alongside more established Caribbean writers who had published abroad. The magazine was thus a major force for regional dialogue, championing regionalism by its actions. Almost every important West Indian writer contributed first poems and short stories to Bim. It was here that they obtained their first encouragement and it was from here that links were established with the BBC programme Caribbean Voices and its producer Henry Swanzy who championed the development of Caribbean writing abroad.\\"\\"Memory of the World - Barbados\\" , Barbados National Register. The founding editor of BIM was Frank Collymore. Subsequent editors have included A. N. Forde, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, John Wickham and E. L. Cozier. The current editors are Esther PhillipsEsther Phillips, \\"BIM: A literary heritage\\", NationNews.com, 15 December 2013. and Curwen Best. ==History== The first issue of BIM appeared in December 1942,\\"Bim - Kyk-Over- Al, Bim, Savacou\\", jrank.org. after which it continued regular publication (originally four times a year) until 1996. Many of the Caribbean writers who later received international recognition in the 1950s and '60s published work in BIM in its early years. Notable contributors included Michael Anthony, Ian McDonald, Sam Selvon, and George Lamming. Lamming wrote (in an introduction to the issue of June 1955): \\"There are not many West Indian writers today who did not use Bim as a kind of platform, the surest, if not the only avenue, by which they might reach a literate and sensitive reading public, and almost all of the West Indians who are now writers in a more professional sense and whose work has compelled the attention of readers and writers in other countries, were introduced, so to speak, by Bim.\\"Albert James Arnold, Julio Rodríguez- Luis, J.

He was first mentioned in 1354-55, and in 1358 was sent by his father to Nyborg to negotiate with representatives of the rebellious Jutes. He became involved in government decisions, and was appointed Duke of Lolland. He also entitled himself as the True Heir of Danes and Slavs. Christopher actively participated in the war for reconquest of Scania which his father had initiated. Christopher was injured during the Battle of Helsingborg in 1362. German chronicles are not clear about what weapon inflicted the prince's mortal wound, but according to Swedish Henrik Smith's chronicle from the early 16th century Christopher was hit by a rock while fighting at sea. According to Nordisk familjebok, Christopher was shot in the head with a rock and subsequently suffered from a mental disorder. Christopher died from an illness the following year in Copenhagen. Although his death is often attributed to his war wounds it is unknown to what extent his injuries actually contributed to the illness. Instead being buried at Sorø Abbey with his father and mother, he was buried in Roskilde Cathedral with his sister Margaret I of Denmark. His tomb was originally commissioned in Central Europe, and depicts the alabaster effigy of a young knight in full armor studded with jewels and surrounded by the heraldic shields of Denmark, Halland and Lolland. The tomb is empty as the prince is probably buried beneath the church floor. The alabaster tomb visible today was restored in 1879 by sculptor Vilhelm Bissen from fragmentary pieces after being destroyed during the Reformation. == References  Other sources == * Jörgensen Ellen: Valdemar Atterdag.

The two concerts were performed outdoors on the grounds of El Morro castle in San Juan, Puerto Rico in December 2011. The CD peaked at #1 on Billboard's New Age Album list in both 2012 and 2013. ==Background== Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico was recorded and filmed during two sold-out concerts performed outdoors on December 16 and 17, 2011, on the grounds of the Castillo San Felipe del Morro (\\"El Morro\\"), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Old San Juan. Yanni had reportedly planned for twenty years to perform at the historic site. Yanni explained that two concerts were planned, for Friday and Saturday night, with the ensuing Sunday being a contingent rain day. It reportedly rained for 25 days in a row preceding the first night's concert on Friday, and the first concert itself was interrupted and eventually cut short three-quarters of the way through, by rain and wind causing danger for the outdoor performance. The evening of the second show, Saturday, the weather was better and the show was completed as planned. Yanni said that 35 cameras, and three live camera operators, were able to capture the show. Departing the island on Sunday, the planned rain day, Yanni noted that it was raining and he could not have carried out a make-up concert then. Yanni later remarked that \\"the weather became part of the show,\\" but that it was the first time in his thirty-year career that a concert had been stopped. To individuals affected by the Friday evening concert that was cut short, the concert's production, José Dueño Entertainment, offered rain checks on tickets towards the next Yanni concert in Puerto Rico or any other José Dueño Entertainment production, and a certificate valid towards receiving the concert DVD. The concerts involved sale of over 10,000 tickets, and cost $3 million to put on. The concerts were the subject of special broadcasts on PBS beginning in March 2012, the video having been recorded in high definition. The production was Yanni's tenth collaboration with PBS. The Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico CD peaked as Billboard's #1 New Age Album (2012 and 2013), at #109 on the Billboard 200 (2012), and debuted at #52 on the Canadian Albums Chart. ==Album track listing== CD: ==DVD track listing== Video DVD: DVD Extras: * Yanni in Puerto Rico * Making of the Show ==Musicians and vocalists== The grounds of El Morro, looking north.

Injuries to prolific-scoring recruit Bob McAdoo and center Bob Lanier, who was traded during the season, left the Pistons without a star player and the team finished with fourteen consecutive defeats.Wright, Kyle; The NBA from Top to Bottom: A History of the NBA from the No. 1 Team to the No. 1,153; pp. 119-120. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 00519a; color:white\\" width=\\"20%\\" College -

The molecule was conceived in March 2010 as a way to celebrate the 2012 London Olympics by Graham Richards of University of Oxford and Antony Williams. It was first synthesized by researchers Anish Mistry and David Fox of the University of Warwick in the UK. Relative energies of olympicene and its isomers were first predicted from quantum electronic-structure computations by Andrew Valentine and David Mazziotti of the University of Chicago. ==Electron counting== Olympicene has 18 pi electrons in its ring system; as it is a flat molecule, this makes it an aromatic molecule. The central ring is not an aromatic ring. ==Related compounds== A very similar molecule (benzo[c]phenanthrene) which lacks the -CH2\\\\- spacer between the two sides of the molecule has been known for many years. This earlier molecule has been studied by X-ray crystallography and due to the steric clash between two hydrogen atoms the molecule is not flat. It is likely that the olympicene is flatter as no steric clash will exist between the two rings. A molecule where the -CH2\\\\- spacer has been replaced with a ketone (C=O) group (naphthanthrone) has been known for decades. Molecules where the CH2 spacer has been replaced with oxygen and sulfur atoms have been known for some time. The sulfur compound has a C-S-C angle of 104.53° which suggests that the sulfur atom is an sp3 hybridized atom rather than being sp2. This suggests that the sulfur atom is not part of the pi system of the molecule. The Olympic rings, showing the interlinking Professor Sir Martyn Poliakoff of the University of Nottingham has pointed out that the Olympic rings are not in fact interlinked, and just touching, and that a better likeness could be made using catenanes. A catenane-based olympic molecule was synthesized in 1994 by Fraser Stoddart and given the name olympiadane.The Problem with Olympicene at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham) ==Synthesis== The synthesis starts using a Wittig reaction of pyrene carboxaldehyde. To obtain the ylide needed, firstly triphenyl phosphine is reacted with ethyl bromoacetate to form a phosphonium salt; after treatment of this salt with a mild base, the ylide can be reacted with the aldehyde in toluene. After hydrogenation of the alpha,beta unsaturated carbonyl compound using hydrogen and palladium in ethyl acetate the ester was converted into the acid chloride using potassium hydroxide, acid and then thionyl chloride. By means of a Friedel–Crafts reaction using aluminium chloride in dichloromethane a ketone was formed. On reduction of this ketone using lithium aluminium hydride the alcohol 3,4-dihydro-5H-benzo[cd]pyren-5-ol was obtained, the 3,4-dihydro-5H-benzo[cd]pyren-5-ol was treated with an acid in the form of ion exchange resin to furnish the product. ==Images== Preliminary images of it were made using scanning tunnelling microscopy. More detailed images were made by IBM researchers in Zurich using non-contact atomic force microscopy in 2012. ==See also== * List of chemical compounds with unusual names * Olympiadane ==References== Category:Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Category:2012 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic culture ","title":"Olympicene"},{"id":"35958608","text":"The 1963–64 NBA season was the Pistons' 16th season in the NBA and seventh season in the city of Detroit.1963–64 Detroit Pistons == Regular season  Season standings === :x – clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=101963-64 NBA Records - !width=100Team !F15110;color:white;width=35\\"BAL !006400;color:white;width=35\\"BOS !0000FF;color:white;width=35\\"CIN !0000FF;color:red;width=35\\"DET !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !FF0000;color:blue;width=35\\"PHI !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"SFW !FF0000;color:white;width=35\\"STL -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Baltimore  —  1–9  2–8  7–3  3–7  7–3  5–5  3–7  3–7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  9–1  —  5–7  7–1  6–3  10–2  10–2  5–3  7–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cincinnati  8–2  7–5  —  7–2  4–4  11–1  9–3  5–4  4–4 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–7  1–7  2–7  —  5–7  4–5  3–5  3–9  2–10 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Los Angeles  7–3  3–6  4–4  7–5  —  6–2  5–4  5–7  5–7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  New York  3–7  2–10  1–11  5–4  2–6  —  4–8  1–8  4–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Philadelphia  5–5  2–10  3–9  5–3  4–5  8–4  —  4–4  3–6 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  San Francisco  7–3  3–5  4–5  9–3  7–5  8–1  4–4  —  6–6 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  St. Louis  7–3  2–7  4–4  10–2  7–5  4–4  6–3  6–6  — } == References == Category:Detroit Pistons seasons Detroit Detroit Pistons Detroit Pistons ","title":"1963–64 Detroit Pistons season"},{"id":"35958612","text":"Xenia is an unincorporated community in Hardin County, Iowa, United States.

For the greater connotation that literally means \\"rule by thieves\\", see Kleptocracy. In politics, a mafia state is a state system where the government is tied with organized crime, including when government officials, the police, and/or military take part in illicit enterprises.Mafia States: Organized Crime Takes Office by Moisés Naím, Foreign Affairs. The term mafia is a reference to any organized crime groups strongly connected with the authorities. According to the critics of the mafia state concept, the term \\"has now been so used and abused in popularized descriptions of organized criminal activity that it has lost much of its analytic value\\". According to US diplomats, defector Alexander Litvinenko coined the phrase \\"mafia state.\\" ==Particular applications of the conceptMafia in Italy and Yakuza in Japan=== Giulio Andreotti, seven-time Prime Minister of Italy, was charged with having links to the Mafia In a critical review of Moisés Naím's essay in Foreign Affairs, Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese Yakuza, writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments. According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat. In Italy, there are three main mafia organisations that originated in the 19th century: the Cosa Nostra originating from the region of Sicily, the Camorra originating from the region of Campania, and the 'Ndrangheta originating from the region of Calabria. Former Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti, had legal action against him, with a trial for mafia association on 27 March 1993 in the city of Palermo. The prosecution accused the former prime minister of \\"[making] available to the mafia association named Cosa Nostra for the defense of its interests and attainment of its criminal goals, the influence and power coming from his position as the leader of a political faction\\". Prosecutors said in return for electoral support of Salvo Lima and assassination of Andreotti's enemies, he had agreed to protect the Mafia, which had expected him to fix the Maxi Trial. Andreotti's defense was predicated on character attacks against the prosecution's key witnesses who were themselves involved with the mafia. Andreotti was eventually acquitted on 23 October 1999. However, together with the greater series of corruption cases of Mani pulite, Andreotti's trials marked the purging and renewal of Italy's political system. The Camorra Casalesi clan rose in the 1980s, gaining control of large areas of the local economy \\"partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges\\". The clan was heavily involved in the Naples waste management crisis that dumped toxic waste around Campania in the 1990s and 2000s; the boss of the clan, Gaetano Vassallo, admitted to systematically working for 20 years to bribe local politicians and officials to gain their acquiescence to dumping toxic waste. ===Countries described as Mafia states=== Republics and territories of the former Yugoslavia Montenegro's president Milo Đukanović is often described as having strong links to Montenegrin mafia.\\"OCCRP announces 2015 Organized Crime and Corruption ‘Person of the Year’ Award\\". Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Kosovo, a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a \\"mafia state\\" by Italian MEP Pino Arlacchi in 2011, and also by Moisés Naím in his 2012 essay \\"Mafia States\\" in the Foreign Affairs. Naím pointed out that Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made, and investigated by several countries, against Thaçi. Naím also labeled Montenegro as a \\"mafia state\\" in the same essay, describing it as a hub for cigarette smuggling. Transnistria Transnistria, an unrecognised break-away state from Moldova, has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a quasistate whose economy is dependent on contraband and gunrunning. For instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, Vladimir Voronin, called Transnistria a \\"residence of international mafia\\", \\"smuggling stronghold\\" and \\"outpost of Islamic combatants\\". The allegations were followed by attempts of customs blockade. Reacting to the allegations, Russian state-run RTR aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of small arms purposely for subsequent illegal trafficking via the Ukrainian port of Odessa. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler Igor Smirnov. However, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in arms trafficking concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria. During the press-conference on 30 November 2006 head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist.Fragment of EUBAM press-conference regarding Mission activities in 2004-2006 Transnistrian Customs Committee Press-Service.

The film was directed by Clarence Brown, who would later start a long career at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film stars Norman Kerry, Claire Windsor, Richard Travers, and Barbara Bedford. The film was released by Universal Pictures. A print of the film exists in the Library of Congress archives in the Raymond Rohauer collection. ==Synopsis== As described in a trade magazine: : Who killed Andrew Prentice? Kenneth Winthrop is tried for the murder of his foster-father, Andrew Prentice. His foster-brother, Robert Armstrong is his accuser. Both love Madeline, who has chosen Winthrop. Armstrong alleges that Edith Craig, secretly engaged to the dead man, and Winthrop were in love, but it is not believed. Circumstantial evidence is introduced offering the time as given by a certain clock. Madeline discovers that what they took for a clock in a butcher's store window was a circular meat scale, the hand of which stays at twelve, the top of the scale, when not in use. This discovery clears her husband. A postal inspector produces a letter written on the night of the murder by Prentice, which had been stolen in a mail holdup and recovered. This letter solves the whole mystery and puts the guilt on the shoulders of Prentice, who then confesses and commits suicide. Madeline finally finds happiness with Armstrong, who has always loved her. ==Cast== *Claire Windsor as Madeline Ames *Norman Kerry as Robert Armstrong *Richard Travers as Kenneth Winthrop *Barbara Bedford as Edith Craig *Charles Wellesley as Andrew Prentice *Frederick Vroom as Carter Ames *Mildred Manning as Mrs. Crown *Ben Deeley as Butler *Harry Mestayer as District attorney *Emmett King as Minister *Dot Farley as Maid *Hayden Stevenson as Taxi driver ==Reviews and reception== George T. Pardy wrote in the Exhibitor's Trade Review that Brown had \\"utilized the flashback with excellent effect in developing the evidence in the case, and right here it should be stated that the courtroom stuff, so frequently overdone and burdened with unnecessary wearisome detail where the average film is concerned, is handled with such dexterity and colorful appeal that the trial scene rivets the spectator's attention from the beginning to end\\". Mary Mac said of the film in the Universal Weekly, that \\"there's a real mystery for you to set your teeth into. You may figure yourself into delirium and you'll probably figure wrong. The picture has been excellently directed, well knit, shorn of irrelevant details, full of suspense, and building steadily and forcefully up to its climaxes\\". A theater manager in Seattle, invited the prosecuting attorneys, county officials, and fifteen law students to a special screening of the film, where he passed out printed ballots for the guests to mark as to who they thought was guilty. Only 4 out of 137 guessed correctly who the murderer was. ==References* *The Acquittal at the Internet Broadway Database *Lobby card cluster (archived) Category:1923 films Category:1923 mystery films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films directed by Clarence Brown Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American mystery films Category:American films based on plays Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"The Acquittal"},{"id":"35958680","text":"Following are the results of the 1969–70 season of the Detroit Pistons, the franchise of the National Basketball Association based in Detroit, Michigan.

The chapel is located in Mount Street in North Sydney, considered a place for spiritual retreat in the middle of the North Sydney business district. The chapel was previously used exclusively by the Sisters of St. Joseph. However, when Mary Mackillop’s remains were moved to the chapel in 1994, where the vestry was originally located. Since then, the chapel has become a place of pilgrimage for thousands of people coming to pray and reflect at her tomb. The Chapel is an imposing building. The facade is set by stone traceried windows . Above of which, are tall commanding spires of carved stone. The Chapel’s altar, lectern and chair are all made from white marble. Images of saints displayed in stained glass and statues adorn the Chapel. Apart from the Chapel, a museum has also been incorporated in the compound. This facility attracts busses of crowds and or tourists, both local and foreign, wanting to know more about the life of Australia’s first saint. The museum is equipped with state of the art technological gadgets & facilities to help provide visitors with a truly transcendental experience to relive Mary Mackillops days. Her life story is weaved by the different sections of the museum. It is also divided in several buildings, each depicting a phase of Mary’s life. Regardless of religious persuasion, it is a pleasant and interesting setting to spend some time for reflection and tranquility, purely from a historical point of view. Despite the abundance of activities other than spiritual retreat, Mary Mackillop Place is in fact a soothing resort which refreshes anyone with its divine calmness.

The English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733. Descriptions of what would come to be called hypertension came from, among others, Thomas Young in 1808 and especially Richard Bright in 1836. Bright noted a link between cardiac hypertrophy and kidney disease, and subsequently kidney disease was often termed Bright's disease in this period. In 1850 George Johnson suggested that the thickened blood vessels seen in the kidney in Bright's disease might be an adaptation to elevated blood pressure. William Senhouse Kirkes in 1855 and Ludwig Traube in 1856 also proposed, based on pathological observations, that elevated pressure could account for the association between left ventricular hypertrophy to kidney damage in Bright's disease. Samuel Wilks observed that left ventricular hypertrophy and diseased arteries were not necessarily associated with diseased kidneys, implying that high blood pressure might occur in people with healthy kidneys; however, the first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by Frederick Akbar Mahomed in 1874 using a sphygmograph. The concept of hypertensive disease as a generalized circulatory disease was taken up by Sir Clifford Allbutt, who termed the condition \\"hyperpiesia\\". However, hypertension as a medical entity really came into being in 1896 with the invention of the cuff-based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva-Rocci in 1896, which allowed blood pressure to be measured in the clinic. In 1905, Nikolai Korotkoff improved the technique by describing the Korotkoff sounds that are heard when the artery is ausculted with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated. Tracking serial blood pressure measurements was further enhanced when Donal Nunn invented an accurate fully automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer device in 1981.Apparatus and method for measuring blood pressure The term essential hypertension ('Essentielle Hypertonie') was coined by Eberhard Frank in 1911 to describe elevated blood pressure for which no cause could be found. In 1928, the term malignant hypertension was coined by physicians from the Mayo Clinic to describe a syndrome of very high blood pressure, severe retinopathy and inadequate kidney function which usually resulted in death within a year from strokes, heart failure or kidney failure. A prominent individual with severe hypertension was Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, while the menace of severe or malignant hypertension was well recognised, the risks of more moderate elevations of blood pressure were uncertain and the benefits of treatment doubtful. Consequently, hypertension was often classified into \\"malignant\\" and \\"benign\\". In 1931, John Hay, Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University, wrote that \\"there is some truth in the saying that the greatest danger to a man with a high blood pressure lies in its discovery, because then some fool is certain to try and reduce it\\". This view was echoed in 1937 by US cardiologist Paul Dudley White, who suggested that \\"hypertension may be an important compensatory mechanism which should not be tampered with, even if we were certain that we could control it\\". Charles Friedberg's 1949 classic textbook \\"Diseases of the Heart\\", stated that \\"people with 'mild benign' hypertension ... [defined as blood pressures up to levels of 210/100 mm Hg] ... need not be treated\\". However, the tide of medical opinion was turning: it was increasingly recognised in the 1950s that \\"benign\\" hypertension was not harmless. Over the next decade increasing evidence accumulated from actuarial reports and longitudinal studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, that \\"benign\\" hypertension increased death and cardiovascular disease, and that these risks increased in a graded manner with increasing blood pressure across the whole spectrum of population blood pressures. Subsequently, the National Institutes of Health also sponsored other population studies, which additionally showed that African Americans had a higher burden of hypertension and its complications. ==Treatment and medications== Historically the treatment for what was called the \\"hard pulse disease\\" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by blood letting or the application of leeches. This was advocated by The Yellow Emperor of China, Cornelius Celsus, Galen, and Hippocrates. In the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries, many therapies were used to treat hypertension, but few were effective, and these were poorly tolerated. Therapies used in that period included strict sodium restriction (for example the rice diet), sympathectomy (surgical ablation of parts of the sympathetic nervous system), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure). The first chemical for hypertension, sodium thiocyanate, was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular. Other treatments, such as barbiturates, bismuth, and bromides were mainly supportive rather than therapeutic. Other drugs were used after the Second World War, the most popular and reasonably effective of which were tetramethylammonium chloride and its derivative hexamethonium. Also used in the post-war period were hydralazine and reserpine (derived from the medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina). A major breakthrough was achieved in the 1950s with the discovery of well-tolerated oral diuretics, the first of which was chlorothiazide (Diuril). This was derived from the antibiotic sulfanilamide and became available in 1958. A randomized controlled trial sponsored by the Veterans Administration comparing hydrochlorothiazide plus reserpine plus hydralazine versus placebo had to be stopped early because those not receiving treatment developed many more complications and it was deemed unethical to withhold treatment from them. The study continued in people with lower blood pressures and showed that treatment even in people with mild hypertension more than halved the risk of cardiovascular death. In 1975, the Lasker Special Public Health Award was awarded to the team that developed chlorothiazide. The results of these studies prompted public health campaigns to increase public awareness of hypertension and promoted the measurement and treatment of high blood pressure. These measures appear to have contributed at least in part to the observed 50% fall in stroke and ischemic heart disease between 1972 and 1994. Soon more drugs became available to treat hypertension. The British physician James W. Black developed beta blockers in the early 1960s; these were initially used for angina, but turned out to lower blood pressure. Black received the 1976 Lasker Award and in 1988 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery. The next class of antihypertensives to be discovered were calcium channel blockers. The first member was verapamil, a derivative of papaverine that was initially thought to be a beta blocker and used for angina, but then turned out to have a different mode of action and was shown to lower blood pressure. The renin–angiotensin system was known to play an important role in blood pressure regulation, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were developed through rational drug design. In 1977 captopril, an orally active agent, was described; this led to the development of a number of other ACE inhibitors. More recently angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors have also been introduced as antihypertensive agents. == References == Category:Hypertension Hypertension ","title":"History of hypertension"},{"id":"35958827","text":"The 2008–09 Liga Indonesia Premier Division (also known as Liga Esia for sponsorship reasons) was the 14th season of the Liga Indonesia Premier Division. It was the first season for the Liga Indonesia Premier Division as the second tier of the Indonesian football pyramid, following the creation of the Indonesia Super League as the first tier. ==Changes from 2007–08 season== The Football Association of Indonesia's decision to create a new Indonesia Super League relegated the Liga Indonesia Premier Division to the second tier of Indonesian football for the first time. For the 2007 season, teams were allocated to one of two groups (with 15 and 14 teams respectively) in the first round. The top four in each group advanced to the second round, or quarter final. The eight teams in the second round were divided into two groups of four, the top two teams in each group advancing to the semifinal in a knock-out system. Champions, runners-up, and 3rd-place teams were promoted to the Indonesia Super League, while the 4th-place team faced the 15th-place team from the Indonesia Super League in a promotion/relegation play-off match. The 14th and 15th-place teams in the first round from each group were relegated to the First Division. ==Season overview== Twenty-nine teams took part. The season began on 4 August 2008 and the last games were played on 29 May 2009. The top four from group 1 in the first round were Persisam Samarinda, PSPS Pekanbaru, Mitra Kukar, and Persikabo Bogor, and from group 2 Persema Malang, Persebaya Surabaya, Persiba Bantul, and Persigo Gorontalo. The group winners – Persisam Samarinda and Persema Malang – hosted the quarter finals, both advancing to the semifinal, again as group winners. In the semifinal Persisam Samarinda beat PSPS Pekanbaru and Persema Malang beat Persebaya Surabaya. The championship was won by Persisam Samarinda with a 1–0 victory over Persema Malang. Persisam Samarinda, Persema Malang, and PSPS Pekanbaru were automatically promoted to the Indonesia Super League. The promotion/relegation playoff was won by Persebaya Surabaya, who beat Indonesia Super League 15th-place team PSMS Medan in a penalty shoot-out to also win promotion. Persibat Batang, PSP Padang, and Persekabpas Pasuruan were relegated to the Liga Indonesia First Division. On 12 November 2008, in their match away to Persibom Bolaang Mongondow at Gelora Ambang Stadium, Kotamobagu, PSIR Rembang players attacked and injured the referee. The incident began when referee Muzair awarded a penalty to Persibom. Angered by the decision, PSIR players punched and kicked the referee, knocking him to the ground and trampling on him; the bruised official had to be rushed to hospital. A similar fate almost befell his replacement, Jusman R.A. He was chased and stripped naked on the field of play after showing a red card to a PSIR player who committed a bad challenge. The match ended 1–0 for Persibom. PSIR were suspended for two years as a result, but on appeal on 1 December 2008 the suspension was lifted, and their next match was rescheduled. The day after the incident PSIR players Yongki Rantung, Tadis Suryanto and Stevie Kusoi were banned from football for life. Five days later Stanley Mamuaya also received a life ban, and fellow players Stanley Katuuk, Gery Mandagi, and M Orah were banned from football for two years. Muzair Usman, Jusman R.A and match inspector Sukarno Wahid subsequently received a reward from PSSI in recognition of their justice, bravery and loyalty, which was considered to have promoted the image of football in Indonesia. ==Groups== The competition was divided into two groups, based on geography. Group 1 or West Group was for clubs from Sumatera, Kalimantan and the Western part of Java, while Group 2 or East Group was for clubs from the Eastern part of Java and Eastern Indonesia. {class=\\" unsortable\\" - ! style=\\"width:250px;\\"Group 1 ! style=\\"width:250px;\\"Group 2 - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persisam Samarinda Persema Malang - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" PSPS Pekanbaru Persebaya Surabaya - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Mitra Kukar Persiba Bantul - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persikabo Bogor Persigo Gorontalo - style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Persikab Bandung Persibom Bolaang Mongondow - style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Persiraja Banda Aceh Persibo Bojonegoro - style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Semen Padang Perseman Manokwari - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persih Tembilahan PSIR Rembang - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" PSDS Deli Serdang Gresik United - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persikad Depok PSS Sleman - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" PSAP Sigli Persis Solo - style=\\"text- align:left;\\" PSSB Bireun PSIM Yogyakarta - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persikota Tangerang Persiku Kudus - style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Persibat Batang Persekabpas Pasuruan -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"PSP Padang } ==First roundSecond round== Note : All matches played in Malang.

The film starred Raj Kapoor, Sanjay Khan, Zeenat Aman and Danny Denzongpa, with Sanjeev Kumar and Farida Jalal in minor roles. The story was written by George Marzbetuny, and Kader Khan wrote the dialogues. It was one of the most expensive Indian films at the time. ==Plot== In an unspecified Arab country, Khaleel (Danny Denzongpa) is a dangerous outlaw bringing terror to the land. Sheikh Mohammed Al-Kamal (Sanjay Khan) is a man of honour, who helps to protect people from harm and is asked by the government to help search for Khaleel. The quest to bring Khaleel to justice becomes a personal one for the Sheikh when his wife Zainab (Zeenat Aman) is injured during a bungled kidnap attempt by Khaleel. Abdullah (Raj Kapoor) is a devout Muslim who lives in a small hut in the middle of the desert, and looks after a well which provides water to thirsty travelers. One day a friend, Ameer (Sanjeev Kumar), informs him that Khaleel had raided a settlement nearby, killing everyone except for Yashoda (Farida Jalal), a pregnant woman. Shortly thereafter, Ameer himself is killed, a mortally wounded Yashoda gives birth to a boy, names him Krishna, asks Abdullah to care for him, and passes away. Abdullah overcomes his fears of bringing up a Hindu boy, and looks after Krishna as his own son. One day Khaleel's magician (Bob Christo) informs him that he is going to die at the hands of Krishna. Just as the Hindu deity Krishna once slew Kansa, his maternal uncle, so also will Khaleel's life end at this Krishna's hands. Angered by this, Khaleel sets out to kill Krishna. He attacks Abdullah, abducts Krishna and readies to kill the boy to get rid of any threat against him. In response, Abdullah and the Sheikh set out to stop this and to deal with Khaleel once and for all. ==Cast== *Raj Kapoor as Abdullah *Sanjay Khan as Sheikh Mohammed-Al-Qamaal *Zeenat Aman as Zainab (Sheikh Mohammed's wife) *Danny Denzongpa as Khaleel *Sujit Kumar as Jamaal *Mehmood as Ahmed *Om Prakash as Hindu Priest *Sanjeev Kumar as Ameer (Special Appearance) *Madan Puri as Military Commander *Kader Khan as Military Officer *Farida Jalal as Yashoda *Rajeev Bhatia as Krishna *Nazir Hussain as Blind Man *Bob Christo as A Magician In The Employ of Khaleel *Helen as Item Dancer ==Soundtrack== Lyrics written by Anand Bakshi. { !

It crosses the Batticaloa Lagoon at Batticaloa. The bridge is part of the A4 Colombo-Batticaloa highway. ==History== The bridge was built in 1924 during British colonial rule. The bridge was named Lady Manning Bridge in honour of the wife of William Manning, the British Governor of Ceylon. It was the oldest and longest iron bridge in Sri Lanka. On average 10,000 vehicles crossed the narrow, single lane bridge daily. Accidents on the bridge would lead to traffic problems in the area. Batticaloa's singing fish legend is associated with the bridge. In 1954 two American priests from St. Michael's College, Batticaloa, Rev. Fr. Lang and Rev. Fr. Moran, recorded fishes singing under the bridge. The recording was broadcast on Radio Ceylon in the 1960s. In 2006 plans were drawn to build a new bridge parallel to the old one. Construction of the new bridge began in March 2008. Problems with the contractor led to another contractor being appointed. The new bridge was formally opened on 22 March 2013. The new two lane bridge is long and wide. The bridge cost Rs. 2.6 billion (US$20 million) and was financed by a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency under the Pro-Poor Eastern Infrastructure Development Project. ==References * Category:1924 establishments in Ceylon Category:2013 establishments in Sri Lanka Category:Bridges completed in 1924 Category:Bridges completed in 2013 Category:Bridges in Batticaloa District Category:Japan International Cooperation Agency Category:Transport buildings and structures in Batticaloa ","title":"Kallady Bridge"},{"id":"35958864","text":"Xenophon is an unincorporated community in Hancock County, Tennessee, United States.

He is also known as the co-founder and former chairman of Lorimar Television. Among the five Emmy nominated programs Rich produced were the series Dallas and Knots Landing. ==Early life and education== Rich was born in Cleveland, Ohio on December 19, 1918. He earned a marketing degree from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. ==Career== Rich began his career in advertising and ultimately became an industry executive. He served in the Navy as a lieutenant in World War II, and then returned to advertising in New York, where he rose to senior vice president and a member of the board of Benton & Bowles . As the ad agency middleman between product company sponsors and television producers, he was involved with The Andy Griffith Show, Make Room for Daddy, The Edge of Night, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., and The Dick Van Dyke Show. Rich left Benton & Bowles in 1965 to partner with the Mirisch Co. and form Mirisch-Rich Productions. There he produced The Rat Patrol. In 1969, he, Merv Adelson, and Irwin Molasky formed Lorimar Productions. Its first production was The Homecoming: A Christmas Story (1971), a television film which led to Lorimar producing the series it inspired, The Waltons, featuring the same characters. The series ran on CBS from 1972 to 1981. Rich also co-produced the short-lived 1977 CBS espionage drama Hunter. Lorimar's biggest hit was the primetime soap Dallas, which ran from 1978-91. In regards to the famous Dallas storyline “Who shot J.R.?” in which Larry Hagman’s character is fired upon in the 1979-80 season finale in March and the assailant is not revealed until the following November, only Rich and writer-director Leonard Katzman knew which of three previously shot endings would be used. After leaving Lorimar in 1986, Rich joined MGM/UA Communications. For two years he was the chairman and chief executive of MGM. ==Personal life== Rich married American actress Pippa Scott in 1964, having three children together before they divorced in 1983,https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118054663?refCatId=14 variety.com though they maintained a friendship until his death.

Studios. It is written by Sam Humphries, an established writer for Marvel whose previous work has included co-writing Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates. The artwork is provided by Francesco Biagini, who has previously illustrated Elric: The Balance Lost. The first issue was released on 9 May 2012. The first printing sold out at the distributor level on 2 May, seven days before the official release. A second print run was undertaken, with the US price remaining at a single dollar. # Vol. 1: #1 - #5. \\"When the final frontier proves to be a desolate wasteland, mankind turns its sights toward (...) alternate Earths.\\" - WorldCat - . # Vol. 2: #6 - #9. \\"Heidi (a girl born in garbage) must ally herself with the last person she ever suspected, an ex-soldier. But can they be trusted, or has Heidi lost sight of the truth?\\" - WorldCat - . ==Story== The series is a follow on from Humphries's 2011 comic series, Our Love is real, which was published by Image Comics. The story is set in a multiverse where many parallel Earths exist, one of which is Higher Earth: a world that has conquered 99 other Earths from alternative timelines. It revolves around a girl named Heidi and a rogue soldier called Rex. Rex is present from the opening scene where he is falling from the sky onto an alternative Earth which has been designated a \\"junk\\" world. He is introduced as being committed to a quest of vengeance against an unspecified opponent. Heidi is introduced as a tough young woman who so far has only known the \\"junk\\" Earth, where garbage is continually falling out of the sky. ==Reception== Trinidad and Tobago Newsday wrote that the comic had already received \\"rave reviews\\", only days after the first issue was released. Several reviewers however did note that the story from issue one is somewhat \\"embryonic\\", suggesting that it is too early to be sure whether its potential will be realised. Newsarama praise the artwork for its sense of daring and sharpness. Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources also praised the artwork stating Biagini's art is good; it's very expressive and the panel progression is smooth. Marcus Doidge however gives the comic only 3.5 out of 5, saying the artwork is \\"solid but never all that remarkable\\". ==References== Category:Science fiction comics Category:Comics about parallel universes ","title":"Higher Earth"},{"id":"35959336","text":"Chelsi Guillen (born May 28, 1993 in Tucson) is an American pair skater who competed with partner Danny Curzon. == Programs == {   - !

The AIOS represents a generic building plan for these organizations to develop interoperable information systems by systematically adjusting and extending their internal information systems. The AIOS was described in a doctoral thesis and is based on the results of various research projects on interoperability.Ziemann (2010): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - An enterprise Model-based Approach for Describing and Enacting Collaborative Business Processes. Logos, 2010. A summary can be found here: Ziemann (2012): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - Reference Architecture for Collaborations between Public Administrations. In: Krallmann, H., Zapp, A. (Eds.): Bausteine einer vernetzten Verwaltung. Berlin, Erich Schmidt Verlag, 2012, pp. 165. It is independent from specific products or vendors but describes generically the different layers, views, relationships and technical means needed to efficiently establish interoperable information systems. To this aim it combines concepts from service-oriented architecture, Collaborative Business and Business Process Modelling. It can be seen as complementary to ARIS, a well-known architecture for internal information systems and business processes. == Definition == Similar to the automation of processes inside organizations, the automation of cross-organizational business processes is an important trend. In this endeavor, collaborating organizations rather strive for a loose coupling of their information systems instead of a tight integration: the collaborating information systems should be able to work together but retain as much independency as possible. This characteristic is also called interoperability, or in the context of collaborating organizations, Business Interoperability, i.e. the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them. Information systems are systems that process information, i.e. they capture, transport, transform, store and offer information. Following the conception prevailing in information systems research, an information system comprises not only the hardware and software of an enterprise, but also the related human actors, business functions and processes as well as organization structures.Compare for example Becker & Schütte (2004, p. 33): Handelsinformationssysteme – Domänenorientierte Einführung in die Wirtschaftsinformatik 2nd Edition, Redline Wirtschaft, Frankfurt or Gabriel(2008): Informationssystem. Enzyklopädie der Wirtschaftsinformatik, Online Lexikon. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, Germany. This broad understanding is for example also embodied by the Zachman Framework. Architecture is defined as the “fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”.IEEE (2007): IEEE 1471 Website, IEEE Std. 1471 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Version 5.0, 19 July 2007. http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ieee-1471-faq.html , ac- cessed: May 2009 Sinz defines an information system architecture as the building plan of an information system in the sense of a specification and documentation of its components and their relationships covering all relevant viewpoints as well as the constructions rules for the creation of the building plan.Sinz (2002): Architektur von Informationssystemen. In: Rechenberg, P., Pomberger, G. (eds.): Informatik-Handbuch. 3rd Edition, Hanser, München, pp. 1055-1068 Accordingly, an Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems can be defined as the building plan of a cross-organizational information system, which enables organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them. == Background and Application == Following the work on interoperable information systems conducted in European Research ProjectsInterop NOE (2004 to 2007, project number IST-2004-508011), ATHENA (2004 to 2007, “Advanced Technologies for Interoperability of Heterogeneous Enterprise Networks and their Application”, project number IST-2004-507849) or R4eGov (2006 to 2009, project number IST-2004-026650) in 2010 the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS) was published as a reference for the construction of loosely coupled, interoperating information systems and for the systematic, model-based enactment of collaborative business processes. The AIOS aims primarily at large organizations that want to interoperate with each other. To this aim it describes how internal information system elements can be systematically connected with the information systems of collaboration partners. The main elements of the AIOS are: # Description of the different data types comprised in interoperable information system as well as their relationships. This is also called the static part, or the structure of the architecture. It tells organizations which information elements (e.g. descriptions of messages, exchange sequences, roles and services) they have to provide to collaboration partners and how they can optimally correlate these to internal elements. # Description of different building paths for implementing or adjusting interoperable information systems. This is also called the dynamic part of the architecture. It tells organization, how to iteratively develop the elements mentioned above. # Concept for the technical components needed to implement the architecture, for example design tools, internal and externally visible repositories. One element comprised in the third category is a \\"BII-repository\\", in which each organization publishes the content of its Business Interoperability Interface (BII) to collaboration partners. Since it comprises external views on information system elements, it provides publishing and discovery functionalities as needed in service- oriented architecture: In the BII, the externally relevant processes, services, organization structures etc. are described on various levels of technical granularity, enabling other organizations to search also for business-level elements and not only for technical artifacts. Here, different from the traditional SOA approach, instead of one central service directory, various partner-specific repositories are implemented. == Structure == The static part of the architecture builds on three orthogonal axes: Enterprise Dimensions, Levels of technical Granularity and Colloborative Views. === Collaborative views === Similar to private, public and global views as known from business process and workflow modeling, in the AIOS, corresponding private, public and global views on information system elements are provided. # The private view comprises the only internally visible information system elements. # The public view acts as an interface to the internal, private system elements; it protects internal systems and enables interoperability without the need for a significant change to the internal systems. This public view describes the information system boundaries of an organization to its collaboration partners and connects internal and external information systems, thereby also providing the content of the Business Interoperability Interface of an organization. # The global view can be used to correlate and connect the public views of different systems. === Enterprise dimensions === Illustration of the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems / Enterprise Dimensions To describe business processes comprehensively this axis provides distinct views on processes, functions, data, and organizational elements. # In the organizational dimension, roles, units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements. This ensures for example, that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles. # In the data dimension, document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types. # In the function dimension, business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described. # In the process dimension, the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations. Thus, in combination with the axis \\"collaborative views\\", private, public and global views on processes, functions, data, and organizational roles are provided. === Levels of technical granularity === AIOS Levels of technical detail The description of system elements on different levels of technical granularity supports a systematic development of collaborative information systems, starting with the business requirements definition and going all the way down to the code level. Apart from the construction aspect, thereby also a multi-dimensional interoperability description is provided, facilitating the synchronization of collaborating systems on each level. Similar to for example ARIS and OMG's MDA three levels are used: # Business Level: Here the processes to be automated are described from a technique independent level. In MDA this level is referred to as CIM level. # Technical Level: Here the IT concept is described. Therefore, the models from the first level are technically enriched, for example, instead of business functions now components are described, but still on a coarse-grained, conceptual level. Since the models on the second level represent the basis for an automated generation of executable code, they might have to be further adapted to fit implementation level constraints. # Execution Level: Here the models are machine interpretable and can be used during runtime in the execution of processes. == References == Category:Interoperability Category:Service-oriented (business computing) Category:Business software Category:Collaborative software Category:Software architecture ","title":"Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems"},{"id":"35959374","text":"JoAnne R.

The original product is a tub of natural, green-coloured gel consisting of honey, molasses, sugar and lemon juice. Inspiration for the product came from her daughter's desire to remove the hair from her arms. A \\"concept\\" used by her mother and grandmother was \\"improved\\" by Ismiel herself, in order to reduce the pain of the waxing process on her daughter. The product took twelve months to develop. Ismiel notified her colleagues at her employment of the result, in which \\"people wanted me [Ismiel] to bring it in for them to take unwanted hair from their eyebrows and upper lips -- and everybody loved it\\". The process of developing the gel was completed in a large pot, later to be undertaken in Ismiel's garage which she made into a factory. She received her own stall at a market in Flemington, New South Wales, New South Wales, and soon got stalls in local shopping centres throughout Australia. The product's commercial success came from an investment in a television advertising campaign, in which a call centre was developed to take the orders of the product. ==Laser clinics== Nad's has six laser hair removal clinics across Sydney.

They were located in the Stourton area of the city. The power stations were built in the early 1950s and early 1960s, taken out of use in 1983 and 1994National Grid website - list of generation disconnections and subsequently dismantled but the associated 400 kV switching substation was retained and remains in use. ==Skelton Grange A== Preparatory work for Skelton Grange was begun by Leeds Corporation in 1946. Upon nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948 the partly built plant was vested in the British Electricity Authority (1948-55), then the Central Electricity Authority (1955-57) and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) from 1958. The power station was designed and built by Marples Ridgway, a joint venture between Lord Marples and Reginald Ridgway. The site was selected for accessibility to the Aire and Calder Navigation, this provided access for colliers delivering coal and removing ash, and water for cooling. Skelton Grange A had a generating capacity of 360 MW. There were six C.A. Parsons 60 MW 3-cylinder reaction type turbines with 75,000 kVA alternators generating at 11 kV. The first generating set was commissioned in April 1951 followed by the second set in November 1951, then August 1952, June 1954, December 1954 and the sixth set in December 1955. The boiler plant comprised nine International Combustion 6 × 360,000 lb/hr and 3 × 550,000 lb/hr (a total of 480 kg/s) operating at 975 psi and 940°F (67.2 bar and 504°C). The station had two chimneys and originally had three cooling towers. The Kier cooling towers each had a capacity of 3.25 million gallons per hour 4.1 m3/s). Water was supplied from the River Aire and sewage effluent. The capacity and output of Skelton Grange A is given in the following table.GEGB Annual report and accounts, various years {  +Skelton Grange A electricity capacity and output !Year !1954 !1955 !1956 !1957 !1958 !1961 !1962 !1963 !1971 !1979 !1982 - !Installed capacity, MW 168 280 336 336 336 360 360 360 360 180 180 - !Electricity output, GWh 1,331.8 1,496.5 2,093.9 2,329.6 2,677.9 2317 2038 1768 1,333.8 502 298.1 } In October 1975 the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) gave the station 12 months notice of partial closure. Full closure of the A station was on 31 October 1983. == Skelton Grange B == Skelton Grange B was built to the south east of the A station, and was commissioned by the CEGB in 1960–62. Unit No. 1 of the B station was first commissioned in October 1960, Units 2 and 3 were commissioned in 1961 and Unit 4 in 1962. The B station had four pulverised fuel boilers each producing 108 kg/s of steam. The steam conditions were 103.42 bar at 538°C, reheat was to 538°C. There were four 120 MW turbo- alternators giving a total gross installed capacity of 480 MW, and a net output of 448 MW. Skelton Grange B was one of the CEGB's twenty steam power stations with the highest thermal efficiency; in 1963–4 the thermal efficiency was 32.24 per cent, 32.02 per cent in 1964–5, and 31.90 per cent in 1965–6. The annual electricity output of Skelton Grange B was: {  +Electricity output of Skelton Grange B !Year 1960–1 1961–2 1962–3 1963–4 1964–5 1965–6 1971–2 1978–9 1981–2 - !Installed capacity, MW 120 480 480 448 448 448 480 480 480 - !Electricity supplied, GWh 222 1308 2500 2,339 2,427 2,376 1,772 1,422 1,790 } Condensing of steam was by regenerative condensers using circulating water from the River Aire and three cooling towers. Skelton Grange B had a single taller chimney. Upon privatisation of the electricity industry in 1990 ownership of the B station was transferred to National Power. Skelton Grange B station closed in 1994. The cooling towers and chimneys were demolished on 12 November 1995. == Development proposals == The site has had many proposals for re-use since it closed; it was considered as a site for a new stadium for Leeds United in 2001, and RWE npower wanted to construct industrial warehousing on the site in 2007. It was sold to the Harworth Group in 2016 who have used some of the land for their Gateway 45 project. The site was also considered as a location for a depot for High Speed 2 rolling stock terminating and starting at Leeds. == See also == Kirkstall Power Station ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Leeds Category:Power stations in Yorkshire and the Humber Category:1951 establishments in England Category:1994 disestablishments in England Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Demolished power stations in the United Kingdom Category:Former power stations in England ","title":"Skelton Grange power station"},{"id":"35959490","text":"Miguel Mir Rodon (born 18 April 1956) is a former professional tennis player from Spain.ITF Pro Circuit Profile ==Career== Mir made his first Grand Slam appearance at the 1975 French Open, where he was beaten in the opening round by Roger Taylor.ATP World Tour Profile He didn't return to the tournament until 1980, when he again made a first round exit, with Brian Gottfried winning in straight sets.

The station occupies an area of approximately . Situated approximately to the north-east of Geraldton, it includes a good length of the Murchison River within its boundary. The property adjoins Boolardy, Milly Milly and Mileura Stations. ==Early history== The station was taken up as early as 1875 by Edward Wittenoom and his brother Frank Wittenoom; Edward moved on after about five years but Frank stayed on and sold the property in 1926. The Murchison amateur racing club was established at Nookawarra by Frank Wittenoom in 1881. Races were held at the property for the next 16 years with Wittenoom winning many races. In 1886, the property held 10,000 sheep under the management of Mr. J. Judge, as well as 250 cattle and 170 horses. It was observed at this time that the land was in good condition and was open grass plain lightly wooded with gum trees, acacia and mulga. The property was watered with clay holes and shallow wells. The Governor of Western Australia, Frederick Broome, visited the station as part of his tour of the Mid-West in 1887. The Murchison pastoral show was held at the station showgrounds in 1894. Charles Pretlove, who died in 1898, managed the station during the mid-1890s. John Hearn managed the station in the late 1890s for Wittenoom; he later went to purchase Gabyon Station. Edward Telfer also managed the station in the early 1900s. John Judge managed the station through the 1900s; he died in 1909 in Geraldton hospital after a protracted illness. An Aboriginal man named Peter was killed by two other Aborigines at the station in 1912. The two men accused were thought to have killed him as part of a revenge attack. The two accused were later released for lack of a witness. 1929 was a good year, with 13,000 sheep and lambs being clipped for satisfactory results. The flock contained 3,800 lambs and the blowfly was said to be very active and needing extra attention. The station also made a \\"satisfactory\\" cattle sale. ==Notable events== Jack Smith, an employee at Nookawarra, was accidentally shot in the chest with a .310 rifle. The mishap occurred in 1949 when Smith and another man were shooting from the car they were in and a rifle accidentally discharged. The bullet entered Smith's chest, pierced his lung and exited through his back. Smith was taken to Geraldton hospital to recover.

In this way, a nucleotide sequence may make a contribution to the function of one or more gene products. Overprinting refers to a type of overlap in which all or part of the sequence of one gene is read in an alternate reading frame from another gene at the same locus. Overprinting has been hypothesized as a mechanism for de novo emergence of new genes from existing sequences, either older genes or previously non-coding regions of the genome. Overprinted genes are particularly common features of the genomic organization of viruses, likely to greatly increase the number of potential expressible genes from a small set of viral genetic information. ==Classification== Tandem out-of-phase overlap of the human mitochondrial genes ATP8 (+1 frame, in red) and ATP6 (+3 frame, in blue) Genes may overlap in a variety of ways and can be classified by their positions relative to each other. * Unidirectional or tandem overlap: the 3' end of one gene overlaps with the 5' end of another gene on the same strand. This arrangement can be symbolized with the notation → → where arrows indicate the reading frame from start to end. * Convergent or end-on overlap: the 3' ends of the two genes overlap on opposite strands. This can be written as → ←. * Divergent or tail-on overlap: the 5' ends of the two genes overlap on opposite strands. This can be written as ← →. Overlapping genes can also be classified by phases, which describe their relative reading frames: *In-phase overlap occurs when the shared sequences use the same reading frame. This is also known as \\"phase 0\\". Unidirectional genes with phase 0 overlap are not considered distinct genes, but rather as alternative start sites of the same gene. *Out-of-phase overlaps occurs when the shared sequences use different reading frames. This can occur in \\"phase 1\\" or \\"phase 2\\", depending on whether the reading frames are offset by 1 or 2 nucleotides. Because a codon is three nucleotides long, an offset of three nucleotides is an in-phase, phase 0 frame. ==Evolution== Overlapping genes are particularly common in rapidly evolving genomes, such as those of viruses, bacteria, and mitochondria. They may originate in three ways: # By extension of an existing open reading frame (ORF) downstream into a contiguous gene due to the loss of a stop codon; # By extension of an existing ORF upstream into a contiguous gene due to loss of an initiation codon; # By generation of a novel ORF within an existing one due to a point mutation. The use of the same nucleotide sequence to encode multiple genes may provide evolutionary advantage due to reduction in genome size and due to the opportunity for transcriptional and translational co-regulation of the overlapping genes. Gene overlaps introduce novel evolutionary constraints on the sequences of the overlap regions. ===Origins of new genes=== A cladogram indicating the likely evolutionary trajectory of the gene-dense pX region in human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV1), a deltaretrovirus associated with blood cancers. This region contains numerous overlapping genes, several of which likely originated de novo through overprinting. In 1977, Pierre-Paul Grassé proposed that one of the genes in the pair could have originated de novo by mutations to introduce novel ORFs in alternate reading frames; he described the mechanism as overprinting. It was later substantiated by Susumu Ohno, who identified a candidate gene that may have arisen by this mechanism. Some de novo genes originating in this way may not remain overlapping, but subfunctionalize following gene duplication, contributing to the prevalence of orphan genes. Which member of an overlapping gene pair is younger can be identified bioinformatically either by a more restricted phylogenetic distribution, or by less optimized codon usage. Younger members of the pair tend to have higher intrinsic structural disorder than older members, but the older members are also more disordered than other proteins, presumably as a way of alleviating the increased evolutionary constraints posed by overlap. Overlaps are more likely to originate in proteins that already have high disorder. ==Taxonomic distribution== Overlapping genes in the bacteriophage ΦX174 genome. There are 11 genes in this genome (A, A*, B-H, J, K). Genes B, K, E overlap with genes A, C, D. Overlapping genes occur in all domains of life, though with varying frequencies. They are especially common in viral genomes. ===Viruses=== The RNA silencing suppressor p19 from tomato bushy stunt virus, a protein encoded by an overprinted gene. The protein specifically binds siRNAs produced as part of the plant's RNA silencing defense against viruses. The existence of overlapping genes was first identified in viruses; the first DNA genome ever sequenced, of the bacteriophage ΦX174, contained several examples. Overlapping genes are particularly common in viral genomes. Some studies attribute this observation to selective pressure toward small genome sizes mediated by the physical constraints of packaging the genome in a viral capsid, particularly one of icosahedral geometry. However, other studies dispute this conclusion and argue that the distribution of overlaps in viral genomes is more likely to reflect overprinting as the evolutionary origin of overlapping viral genes. Overprinting is a common source of de novo genes in viruses. Studies of overprinted viral genes suggest that their protein products tend to be accessory proteins which are not essential to viral proliferation, but contribute to pathogenicity. Overprinted proteins often have unusual amino acid distributions and high levels of intrinsic disorder. In some cases overprinted proteins do have well-defined, but novel, three-dimensional structures; one example is the RNA silencing suppressor p19 found in Tombusviruses, which has both a novel protein fold and a novel binding mode in recognizing siRNAs. ===Prokaryotes=== Estimates of gene overlap in bacterial genomes typically find that around one third of bacterial genes are overlapped, though usually only by a few base pairs. Most studies of overlap in bacterial genomes find evidence that overlap serves a function in gene regulation, permitting the overlapped genes to be transcriptionally and translationally co-regulated. In prokaryotic genomes, unidirectional overlaps are most common, possibly due to the tendency of adjacent prokaryotic genes to share orientation. Among unidirectional overlaps, long overlaps are more commonly read with a one-nucleotide offset in reading frame (i.e., phase 1) and short overlaps are more commonly read in phase 2. Long overlaps of greater than 60 base pairs are more common for convergent genes; however, putative long overlaps have very high rates of misannotation. Robustly validated examples of long overlaps in bacterial genomes are rare; in the well-studied model organism Escherichia coli, only four gene pairs are well validated as having long, overprinted overlaps. ===Eukaryotes=== Compared to prokaryotic genomes, eukaryotic genomes are often poorly annotated and thus identifying genuine overlaps is relatively challenging. However, examples of validated gene overlaps have been documented in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, including mammals such as mice and humans. Eukaryotes differ from prokaryotes in distribution of overlap types: while unidirectional (i.e., same-strand) overlaps are most common in prokaryotes, opposite or antiparallel-strand overlaps are more common in eukaryotes. Among the opposite-strand overlaps, convergent orientation is most common. Most studies of eukaryotic gene overlap have found that overlapping genes are extensively subject to genomic reorganization even in closely related species, and thus the presence of an overlap is not always well-conserved. Overlap with older or less taxonomically restricted genes is also a common feature of genes likely to have originated de novo in a given eukaryotic lineage. ==References== Category:Genes ","title":"Overlapping gene"},{"id":"35960049","text":"Andrew S.

It was launched on 25 May 2012 and dissolved in late 2014 after Scotland voted against independence. Yes Scotland's chief executive was Blair Jenkins, and Dennis Canavan was the chair of its advisory board. Stephen Noon, a long term employee and policy writer of the SNP, was Yes Scotland's chief strategist. Its principal opponent in the independence campaign was the unionist Better Together campaign. By the formal start of the referendum campaign period in May 2014, it had become the \\"biggest grassroots movement in Scottish political history\\", said Jenkins. The campaign did not win independence, but \\"transformed politics in Scotland\\", suggested The Herald. ==History== Yes Scotland activists at demonstration It was launched in Edinburgh on 25 May 2012. The launch featured actors Alan Cumming and Brian Cox. A few days after the official launch, the campaign was forced to make changes to its website; this was after people who followed its Twitter feed had been listed on the website as supporters of the campaign. Yes Scotland officially opened its campaign staff headquarters on 19 November 2012 in Hope Street, Glasgow. The headquarters were open to the public. By February 2013, Yes Scotland employed 17 people full-time. In March 2013, a number of Yes Scotland activists promoted the movement at bedroom tax protests throughout Scotland. Yes Scotland first disclosed its finances in April 2013, revealing it had taken over £1.6m in donations. In July 2013, the Sunday Herald reported that there were \\"persistent rumours\\" of funding problems within Yes Scotland, and suggested that these were related to Jacqueline Caldwell and Susan Stewart leaving the campaign organisation. The organisation \\"shared out\\" the women's responsibilities between other employees instead of replacing them. Throughout 2013, Yes Scotland launched specially targeted campaign groups like Veterans for Independence, Farming for Yes, and Crofters for Yes. In August 2013, the chief executive of Better Together, Blair MacDougall, accused figures within Yes Scotland of \\"copy[ing]\\" his campaign's slogan \\"best of both worlds\\" to \\"reassure voters over independence\\". In response, a senior SNP source said that \\"It's arrogant of the No campaign to claim ownership of language.\\" Later in August, Yes Scotland filed a police complaint that its internal emails had been accessed illegitimately. Details of the particular email that was accessed were not initially released, but it was later revealed to be correspondence with Dr Elliot Bulmer in connection with an article he wrote for the Herald in July, A Scottish constitution to serve the commonweal. Their campaign opponents, Better Together, accused Yes Scotland of \\"secretly paying off supposedly impartial experts\\" and urged an inquiry, as Dr Bulmer is research director of the Constitutional Commission, a registered charity which states that it has no political alignment. Yes Scotland said the payment was a \\"nominal fee for the considerable time and effort [Dr Bulmer] spent\\" on the piece, and its content was not influenced. Then, the Telegraph reported that Police Scotland were opening a hacking inquiry in response to a complaint received from the campaign about internal emails that appeared to have been accessed illegitimately and leaked to the media. At the end of 2014, chief executive Blair Jenkins sent a message to supporters to join the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Greens or the Scottish Socialist Party to ensure that campaigners \\"keep the spirit alive\\". ==Participation== The campaign was an alliance of the governing Scottish National Party, the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Green Party. The Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie helped launch the campaign but following this had expressed some reservations. Harvie told the Green's conference in October 2012 that he felt the campaign had become fully inclusive, and the party members voted for \\"full participation\\" in the campaign. The organisation also collaborated with Labour for Independence, an organisation for pro-independence supporters of the Scottish Labour Party. In 2013, Yes Scotland covered the £245 accommodation bill for LFI's first conference. Other groups supporting a Yes vote include Women for Independence and Business for Scotland. The campaign had endorsements by several high-profile figures residing outwith Scotland, including Hollywood actor Alan Cumming, James Bond star Sir Sean Connery, and actor Brian Cox. ===Advisory Board=Donations== In April 2013, the campaign revealed that it had received over £1.6m in donations since its launch the preceding May. Roughly £1.3m of this came from five donors, including the two EuroMillions winners, Christine and Colin Weir. A contribution to the value of £342,797 was provided by the Scottish National Party to \\"fund the start-up and staffing costs including the official launch on May 25, 2012\\". ==Yes Declaration== The campaign aimed to have one million residents of Scotland sign its \\"Yes Declaration\\", a statement of intent to support the independence of Scotland. Signatures could be input electronically by supporters using the campaign's website, and were also collected by grassroots activists who were encouraged to campaign in their local communities and around Scotland at appropriate events. The declaration read: The Sunday Mail newspaper reported that by 1 July 2012 approximately 22,000 people had signed the declaration and almost 8000 signed up to the cause on the first day, 'prompting organisers to remove a counter from their website'. The newspaper went further by stating that 'There was more embarrassment when it emerged they used actors in a picture on the site.' In September, Alex Salmond announced that Yes Scotland had gathered over 100,000 signatures for the Yes Declaration. By St. Andrew's Day of the same year, the figure had risen to 143,000, to which a Better Together spokesman responded that ″If they want to sign up enough Scots to win a majority, they will still be chasing signatures in 2018\\" The total reached 372,103 by 24 May 2013, and 789,191 by 9 June 2014. On 22 August 2014, Yes Scotland announced that they had exceeded their target of 1 million signatures. ==See also== * Better Together (campaign) * Labour for Independence * Women for Independence * National Collective * Yes California == References  External links == * *Yes Declaration Category:2012 establishments in Scotland Category:2012 in British politics Category:Cross-party campaigns Category:Organizations established in 2012 Category:Political campaigns in the United Kingdom Category:Scottish nationalist organisations Category:Private companies limited by guarantee of Scotland Category:2014 Scottish independence referendum ","title":"Yes Scotland"},{"id":"35960102","text":"Luisa Arvide Cambra (born in Almeria, Spain, August 10, 1956) is a Doctor in Arabic Studies with an Extraordinary Degree Award and Special Award Doctorate.

BC Bredenkamp SC appeared for the appellant, and JJ Kotze for the State. Its significance lies primarily in the area of punishment and sentencing. == Facts == The appellant, a farmer, had fired two shots at an unidentified person walking across farmland, who had not responded to his calls. The second shot struck and killed that person. The farmer was convicted of murder by a single judge in the circuit court of the North Gauteng High Court and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, five of which were suspended on the usual conditions. An appeal to the full bench of that court was dismissed in respect of the conviction but upheld in respect of sentence, the court substituting the trial court's sentence with one of ten years' imprisonment. == Judgement == In an appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal, it was held that, accepting the evidence of the witness,The witness testified that \\"he fired the first shot into the ground and there was dust [...]. He shot in the direction of the person [....] The dust was next to the person\\" (Para 9). the appellant (who was a very good marksman) must subjectively have foreseen, when he aimed the second shot at the same place as the first, the possibility that the bullet could ricochet after striking a stone or some other object and in the process strike the deceased. Regardless of that foreseeable possibility, he went on to shoot. He was therefore guilty of murder, the intention being dolus eventualis.Paras 16-17. The court held that, given the public incense with sentences which appeared to favour a particular group in society, courts had to be conscious and sensitive to cases which appeared to have racial or discriminatory connotations, especially when dealing with the question of sentence. Public interest was one of the essential considerations in determining an appropriate sentence. The public interest against discrimination was not necessarily in discrimination between black and white but rather between people in general, who perceive others, with prejudice, to be different or inferior to them. It was this perception that the judiciary should address. The effect of hate crimes went far beyond the victims and served to traumatise whole communities and damaged South African society. Without the decision makers in the criminal justice system being attuned to these issues, it would not be possible properly to combat hate crimes.Paras 24-25. == See also == * Dolus eventualis * Intention (criminal law) * Mens rea * Sentence (law) * South African criminal law * South African law == References == * S v Combrink 2012 (1) SACR 93 (SCA). == Notes == Category:Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa cases Category:2011 in South African law Category:2011 in case law Category:South African criminal case law ","title":"S v Combrink"},{"id":"35960331","text":"Patinoire Polesud or Pôle Sud (English: \\"South Pole Ice Rink\\") is a 3,496-seat multi-purpose arena in Grenoble, France.

He is also known as \\"The Dutch Haydn\\". Joseph Schmitt was a student of Carl Friedrich Abel, who was a student of J.S. Bach and a mentor of Mozart, and probably also had close contact with composers and performers at the court in Mannheim. In 1753, at age 19, Schmitt was admitted into the clergy. For a period of around 20 years worked as a musical priest at the Cistercian Eberbach Abbey (Kloster Eberbach) in the Rheingau, where he composed a broad range of music, from sacred to secular, chamber to symphonic. In the early 1770s, Schmitt moved to Amsterdam, where he already had compositions published by leading European music publishing firm, the Hummel brothers. Schmitt established himself quickly in the city, becoming music director at the Felix Meritis society, where he worked for the next two decades, and opening his own publishing firm which subsequently introduced major works by composers such as Mozart to northern Europe for the first time. In his various roles Schmitt became the most important figure in Dutch musical life in the second half of the 18th century. As a composer, Schmitt's works are beautifully crafted. His style is sparkling and cosmopolitan. It is definitely influenced by Abel, Bach's sons and the Mannheimers, but also possesses a highly refreshing originality and a highly distinctive voice - beautifully balancing elegance, energy and sturm und drang elements. As a historical figure, Schmitt has largely been ignored by the Dutch, despite his pioneering role in the realisation of the country's first purpose built concert hall, the Felix Meritis. The hall opened in October 1788 with Schmitt conducting the inaugural performance. In the 19th century, the hall was the central point of Dutch music life and hosted the Dutch débuts of luminary performers including Clara Schumann and Brahms. Schmitt's compositions had been largely forgotten, until recently. Dutch-based Australian conductor Simon Murphy has been responsible for reintroducing Schmitt's music to the world in performance, through broadcasts, on disc and in new editions. In the 18th century, Schmitt's music was particularly popular in northern Europe, Scandinavia and on the east coast of the U.S. Listings of performances of his orchestral works can be found on 18th-century programmes from U.S. concert societies, and Schmitt's works are included in the listings of the holdings of most 18th-century European court, orchestral and music society libraries. == CD recordings of Schmitt's works == Together with The Hague's Baroque Orchestra, The New Dutch Academy, conductor Simon Murphy has made the world-première recordings of Schmitt's early symphonic and chamber music (PENTATONE, 2006). These recordings include Schmitt's first Dutch written and published symphony, the Symphony in G c. 1772, and the colourful, Symphony in E flat, \\"The Hurdy Gurdy\\", written in Eberbach in the mid-1760s. == Performances == Together with the New Dutch Academy, conductor Simon Murphy gave the modern-day premiere performances of Schmitt's symphonies and chamber music at a series of concert events in 2002 and 2003 at Schmitt's former workplace in Amsterdam, the Felix Meritis. Murphy performed Schmitt's symphonies and chamber music, again at the Felix Meritis, for the Dutch national broadcaster's radiophonic festival in 2006, Amsterdam - City of Music, broadcast live by the EBU around the world. Since then, Murphy has further championed Schmitt's orchestral works including in concerts at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam and for the Holland Festival of Early Music Utrecht. The Rheingau Musik Festival presented a performance of his Missa solemnis at Eberbach Abbey. The Johann Rosenmüller Ensemble with soloists Heike Heilmann, Franz Vitzthum, Georg Poplutz and Markus Flaig, conducted by Arno Paduch, performed the work in the church for which it was composed and was not heard since 1803, combined with psalms and a Te Deum by Antonio Caldara. == References == Category:1734 births Category:1791 deaths Category:Classical- period composers Category:German conductors (music) Category:German male conductors (music) Category:18th-century classical composers Category:18th- century conductors (music) Category:German classical composers Category:German male classical composers Category:18th-century German composers Category:18th- century male musicians ","title":"Joseph Schmitt"},{"id":"35960387","text":"Stella Tanner (1 January 1925 – 26 March 2012) was an English radio and television actress. Tanner was born in 1925 and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). She left her focus on dramatic acting to form the Tanner Sisters with her sister, Frances Tanner.

It supplies cities of Pardubice and Chrudim and is also an important tourist destination located in protected area Iron Mountains. The dam has also regulatory function and its water is used in some water power plants. ==Location== Seč dam is the largest dam in the protected landscape area Iron Mountains. It is located on river Chrudimka in a valley close to the town of the same name, about 20 kilometers from Chrudim and 25 kilometers from Pardubice. The lake is approx. 7 kilometers long and is situated at 490 meters above the sea level. ==History== The dam was constructed between 1925 and 1934 as a protection against floods. As a result of the construction, 22 buildings were depopulated and flooded. Remains of some of them are popular destination for scuba divers. A small power plant was constructed between 1941 and 1946. In 1947 another smaller reservoir was constructed approx 1 km from the main lake and it is called Seč II. ==Biosystem== The environmentally most valuable part of Seč are Ostrůvek and the Oheb peninsula, which consists of a steep rock that ends with a small rocky promontory covered with pines. This place is a home to some rare invertebrate species (snails, beetles) as well as a natural habitat of Eurasian eagle-owls. The forest that covers the Oheb rock consists of some very old species of European beeches. Dead trees are left to decay and become hosts for a wide range of polypores that feed on their dead wood. ==Tourism== The lake and its surroundings are the main tourist attraction of the Železné hory region. The surroundings are hilly and covered with forests, meadows and fields. The lake offers great variety of activities including swimming, sailing, boating, windsurfing, scuba diving, fishing in summer and ice skating in winter (at own risk). The forests around the lake offer great opportunity for hiking, horse riding or cross-country skiing in winter. The most important places on Seč and its vicinity are: *Oheb: Romantic ruins of a castle from the 13th or 14th century. The remains of the castle's largest tower are clearly visible from the lake and make one of the most distinctive sceneries of Železné hory. *Vildštejn: Another ruin of a small castle now located above a road tunnel next to the dam. Unlike Oheb, Vildštejn is not accessible. *Ostrůvek (little island): Small area below Oheb surrounded by water and covered with trees. It used to be a nudist beach. *Ústupky: Most of the hotels, restaurants and other recreational facilities are located here. *Jewish cemetery: Opposite to Ústupky, several well-preserved Jewish tombstones are located close to the bank of the lake. *Wooden plumbing: Constructed in the 1940s. Outstanding technical sight. Almost 1300m long wooden plumbing that used to supply the power plant with water from the lake. ==Ecology== Oheb and Ostrůvek are protected natural areas threatened by tourists that visit these sites. Another ecological issue is the wastewater from surrounding villages and recreational objects that contaminates the lake. It does not represent a direct risk to the people who swim in the water but it causes algal bloom. In some cases, large areas of green \\"tufts\\" can be observed. This was originally believed to be caused by manure washed down from the fields close to the lake, but results of recent researches proved that fluoride compounds from manure are insoluble in water so it cannot be the primary cause. The algal bloom season on Seč may start as soon as in June and gets worse when there's lack of rain which reduces the water flow.

English had also been noted as a leading figure in the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) during the early years of the Northern Ireland peace process. ==Ulster Defence Association== From an early age, English was involved in the North Belfast Brigade of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary group. After his death, the Belfast Telegraph described him as a \\"UDA commander\\",\\"Boxer ‘volunteered to shoot UDA boss’\\", Belfast Telegraph, 10 September 2009 while the BBC described him as a \\"paramilitary chief\\".\\"UDA boss Tommy English murder accused to be prosecuted\\", BBC News, 3 March 2010 English also became involved in the political wing of the movement, the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), becoming its chairman.David Sharrock, \\"Two killed in revenge raids by loyalists\\", Daily Telegraph, 1 November 2000 He stood for the UDP in North Belfast in the 1996 Northern Ireland Forum election, and was also placed eighth on the party's top-up list, but he was not elected.\\"1996 Forum Elections: Candidates in North Belfast\\", Northern Ireland Elections\\"1996 Elections - List of Candidates\\", Northern Ireland Elections He was active on behalf of the party in the discussions which led to the Good Friday Agreement.\\"Former UDP talks delegate bailed\\", BBC News, 5 November 1999 A noted critic of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) during his political career, English gained notoriety for an appearance at a UDA rally in the Ulster Hall in Belfast when he took to the stage wearing an Ian Paisley mask and a clerical dog collar and proceeded to lampoon the DUP leader.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 335 He was a regular visitor to conferences and events at the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation and was close to Republic of Ireland peace activists Paul Burton and Chris Hudson, visiting the site of the Battle of the Somme with them in 1999. On St Patrick's Day 1998 he met President of the USA Bill Clinton in Washington DC as part of the UDP delegation visiting the US capital. He hit the headlines in 1997 when he was given a bravery award after breaking down the front door of a burning house and bringing the occupier out to safety. Alongside his political activism he remained involved in the paramilitary side of the UDA and played a leading role in orchestrating riots at two interface areas in north Belfast i.e. the Limestone Road - which divides Catholic Newington and Protestant Tigers Bay - and the Whitewell Road. English and his family lived in Tiger's Bay before moving to Newtownabbey at an unspecified period so as to \\"give our kids a chance so they could have a decent life\\" according to his wife Doreen.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 1486 English left the UDP in 1998 after making a public statement against the Orange Order at a time when the party was widely supporting them in their attempts to march in Catholic areas. English also claimed that he had been the subject of allegations about misappropriating money in the UDA and stated that, whilst the allegations were not widely believed by the group's leadership, worries about them had led him to attempt suicide and seek treatment in a psychiatric hospital. In 1999, he was arrested on suspicion of headbutting and kicking a patron of the Crows Nest bar, having allegedly arrived with three associates armed with baseball bats, breaking glasses along the bar. The case was still outstanding, with English awaiting charges, at the time of his death. ==Killing== UDA South East Antrim Brigade mural close to English's home in Ballyduff On 31 October 2000, English was fatally shot at his home in Ballyfore Gardens, on the Ballyduff estate in Newtownabbey, by a group of four men. His three children were inside the house at about 18.30 when the men entered through the back door as his wife, Doreen was preparing food for a Halloween party. She called out to her husband and attempted to close the door but they pushed past her, one of the men shouting \\"Get out of the fucking way, Doreen\\". She kept trying to intervene in an effort to protect English, but she received several hard blows, mostly in the head, and her skull was fractured. English was shot several times as he lay face down in the hallway of his home; the last shot struck him in the lower back. He was rushed to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital where he died shortly afterwards.\\"Wife tells of husband's murder\\", 26 March 2003 The murder was blamed on the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), who at the time were involved in a violent dispute with the UDA.\\"Killing linked to loyalist feud\\", BBC News, 2 November 2000 At his funeral, his coffin was covered in UDA flags, and it was accompanied by men in paramilitary uniforms.\\"Paramilitary funeral for murdered loyalist\\", BBC News, 4 November 2000 Among the mourners was a member of the UVF who was closely related to English. Sympathy notices placed in the local press at the time included one from Johnny Adair, who described English as a \\"good and faithful servant\\". English's murder was said to have been in retaliation for the killing of UVF veteran Bertie Rice earlier that same day.

This very short-stemmed, nearly stemless plant has one or more pairs of opposite, almost hemispherical, grey-green or brownish leaves. The surface of the leaves has many small dark spots. A new pair of leaves is produced each year, replacing an older pair. This plant closely resembles a small cracked rock (hence the common name), an appearance which may have evolved as a defence against herbivory. The superficially daisy-like flowers are yellow- orange, across, and emerge from the plant's apical bud. The flowers are large in relation to the size of the plant. Each flower opens in the afternoon and closes at sunset, over a bloom period of several days. ==Cultivation== P. nelii is one of several plants cultivated for their rocklike appearance.

The presiding officers were Holmes JA, Corbett JA and Kotzé AJA. The case is significant primarily in the area of sentencing, with its determination that the punishment should * fit the criminal as well as the crime; * be fair to society; and * be blended with a measure of mercy according to the circumstances. The court held that in every appeal against a sentence, whether imposed by a magistrate or a Judge, the Court hearing the appeal # should be guided by the principle that punishment is \\"pre-eminently a matter for the discretion of the trial Court\\"; and # should be careful not to erode such discretion; hence the further principle that the sentence should only be altered if the discretion has not been \\"judicially and properly exercised.\\" The test under the second of these points is whether the sentence is vitiated by irregularity or misdirection or is disturbingly inappropriate. == Facts == The appellant had been convicted on nineteen counts of fraud, which had been taken together for the purposes of sentence, the appellant having been sentenced to * a fine of R5 000; and * imprisonment for three years, of which two years had been suspended on relevant conditions. In addition he had been convicted and fined on three counts of overcharging. In an appeal against the sentence on the nineteen counts of fraud, it was contended that they amounted substantially to the same offence of overcharging in contravention of the Rents Act,Act 43 of 1950.s 10(1)(a). for which the appellant had merely been fined on the other three counts on which he had been convicted. == Judgment == The Court, however, found that the fraud was intended to be and was a cover-up for the unlawful overcharging of rents, and held that there was no basis for appellate interference with the trial Judge's sentence. The Appellate Division did not have an overriding discretion to ameliorate the sentences of trial Courts. The discretion was pre-eminently theirs, alterable only on the grounds mentioned above. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. == See also == * Crime in South Africa * Criminal procedure in South Africa * Law of South Africa * South African criminal law * Sentence (law) == References  Case law === * S v Rabie 1975 (4) SA 855 (A). === Legislation === * Rents Act 43 of 1950. == Notes == Category:Appellate Division (South Africa) cases Category:1975 in South African law Category:1975 in case law ","title":"S v Rabie"},{"id":"35960580","text":"McCubbins is a surname.

It features actor Joe Odagiri as a father of three children and a musician who was once very famous, though his popularity has since waned. Before its debut, Kazoku no Uta was hit by accusations of plagiarism. The script was said to be extremely similar to the storyline of the 1987 television series Papa wa Newscaster. The script of Kazoku no Uta was subsequently changed due to this accusation. Kazoku no Uta was aired from 15 April 2012 to 6 June 2012 as part of Fuji Television's Dramatic Sunday time slot, which airs every Sunday from 9pm to 9:54pm. The number of episode was cut from the usual 10 to 8 after this series received continuously low viewership ratings. The two remaining episodes were replaced by special episodes of the drama Hayami-san to Yobareru Hi. ==Story== In 1997, the rock band achieved fame with their debut single \\"Going\\". However, it subsequently broke up after the band leader Seigi announced that he will make his solo debut. Fifteen years later, in 2012, Seigi has already fallen out of the public eye, though he still clings on stubbornly to his outdated style of music. Only his agent and some die-hard fans are still willing to support him. One day, three children who claimed that Seigi is their father suddenly appears. Two of them are siblings whose mother had recently died, while the other is left at home alone because her mother frequently runs away with her boyfriends. Seigi eventually takes them in to care for them. Over time, Seigi and the children start to bond after overcoming the many challenges that come their way. Thanks to the influence of his children, Seigi starts to grow out of his selfish and immature ways, and starts to consider the feelings of his children and the people around him. ==CastHayakawa household=== * Joe Odagiri as : The vocalist and guitarist of the once-famous rock band Under Cloud. The band became very popular after their debut single, Going, was released. He subsequently left the band and made his solo debut, but did not see much popularity. In 2012, he is left with only a radio program presenter job. Despite that, he still maintains his childish and lazy personality. He later starts to mature after living together with his three children, whom he reluctantly adopted. Seigi often quotes The Rolling Stones member Keith Richards to justify his decisions. * Hana Sugisaki as : A 2nd year junior high student and Seigi's daughter. She is frequently left alone at home by her mother, who always runs away with different men, only to turn up again after she is dumped. One day, Kokoro decides to live with Seigi after she is deceived yet again by her mother's promise of returning back. She is talented in composing music and playing the guitar, and one of her compositions was chosen as the song used in a zoo's advertisement. Later, it was revealed that Kokoro is not actually Seigi's daughter, but instead, the daughter of a now- deceased man. In the end, she decides to forgive her mother and moved Toyama with her mother. * Ayane Omori as : A grade 6 student in elementary school and Seigi's daughter. She and her brother ran away from an abusive aunt who was taking care of them after their mother's death half a year ago. She corners Seigi one day and demands that he takes them in because he is her father. Reluctant at first, Seigi agreed to take them in. Mitsuki is a strong-willed girl who dislikes housework, a trait that sometimes put her into conflict with Kokoro. * Kanata Fujimoto as : A grade 2 student in elementary school and Mitsuki's half brother. Their mother married after she gave birth to Mitsuki. Although he is not a blood relative of Seigi's, he looks up to him. He frequently relies on his sister, and is not very good at singing. He favourite phrase is \\"rock-n-roll\\". * Tatsuya Fuji as : An old man who appears with Kokoro. He met Kokoro one day while drawing at a park, and later became her confidant.

Due to the extremely low ratings, the CEO of Fuji Television announced that this television series will end with only 8 episodes. The low ratings was attributed to the plagiarism accusation that was brought about before this series debuted. Another reason cited for the dismal performance was the popular TBS's television ATARU. This television series, which was broadcast at the same time as Kazoku no Uta, garnered 19.1% viewership ratings for its first episode. ==ReferencesKazoku no Uta on Facebook * Category:Japanese drama television series Category:Fuji TV dramas Category:2012 Japanese television series debuts Category:2012 Japanese television series endings ","title":"Kazoku no Uta"},{"id":"35960598","text":"McCudden is a surname.

He wins the title of Mr. Tamil Nadu, which gives him direct entry to the Mr. India pageant. He is infatuated with Diya, a leading supermodel. Diya is soon blacklisted, with all her advertisement film contracts cancelled by John, her co-star in all her advertisements, after she constantly rejected his sexual advances. To save her career, Diya decides to replace John with Lingesan, whom she had earlier met at one of her shoots, as her co-star for her next advertisement. The shooting is to take place in China at the same time when the Mr. India pageant is to take place, but Lingesan agrees, sacrificing his Mr. India ambitions in the process. Lingesan is given a makeover by Diya's stylist, a transgender woman Osma Jasmine. The shoot initially does not go well as Lingesan is shy and awkward around Diya. On her director's advice, Diya pretends to fall in love with Lingesan so that he would loosen up and perform better during the shoot. The plan proves successful but Diya soon tells Lingesan the truth. Hurt, he focuses on modelling instead of her. They both gradually excel in the modelling industry as the lead pair. As time passes, Diya reciprocates Lingesan's love for her and they soon get engaged. In his journey from a bodybuilder to a top model, Lingesan makes many enemies, including John, whose modelling career was ruined due to Lingesan's rising popularity, forcing him to appear in local advertisements to stay afloat; Osma, who was infatuated with Lingesan and revealed her feelings to him, only to be rejected; industrialist Indrakumar, whose company suffered losses when Lingesan refused to endorse their soft drink as it was reported to contain pesticides; and another bodybuilder Ravi, who also competed for the Mr. Tamil Nadu title but lost to Lingesan. These four people conspire to take revenge on Lingesan and destroy his fame and modelling career. Two days before his wedding, Lingesan slowly starts to experience hair and teeth loss and a skin disorder. He consults his friend Vasudevan, a doctor who is also the guardian of Diya's family. Vasudevan claims that he is suffering from a rare and incurable genetic disease which results in premature ageing. Lingesan's condition worsens, with his face and body deforming, and eventually he becomes a hunchback. In his current condition, Lingesan decides to disappear from public eye and also from Diya's life by faking his death in a car accident. Only his friend Babu and Vasudevan know that he is alive. Lingesan asks Vasudevan to marry Diya as he is the only person who will be able to understand Diya's past and present situation. Vasudevan agrees and the wedding is fixed. On the eve of Diya's wedding, another doctor named Thiruvengadam reveals to Lingesan that, contrary to Vasudevan's claims, he is actually suffering from H4N2 influenza, caused by the \\"I\\" virus, which can only be transmitted by injection. Lingesan discovers that John, Osma, Indrakumar, Ravi and, to his horror, even Vasudevan, are responsible for injecting the virus into his body. Vasudevan had an insatiable lust for Diya since she was a schoolgirl and was enraged when she chose Lingesan over him. Therefore, he sided with Lingesan's enemies and planned the entire operation to have Lingesan injected with the virus. Lingesan is then beaten up by them and tied up, but manages to escape later. Enraged and betrayed, Lingesan abducts Diya on the wedding day and keeps her safely in an old house without revealing his identity to her. Aided by Babu, Lingesan decides to take revenge on those who had deformed him without killing them. He first immolates Ravi, who suffers severe burns. He then prepares a paste which Osma unknowingly applies on her body, causing her body to sprout huge growths of hair. Next, he subjects Indrakumar to bee stings all over his body. He fights John over a moving train and gets him electrocuted. Finally, he gets Vasudevan to unwittingly inject a virus into himself, causing his whole body to swell up. After achieving his revenge, Lingesan reveals his condition to Diya, who, though initially taken aback, still loves him despite his deformity. They decide to live a secluded life together. Lingesan undergoes ayurvedic treatment, yoga and physiotherapy for his condition and soon returns to normal. ==Cast== * Vikram as Lingesan \\"Lee\\" * Amy Jackson as Diya * Suresh Gopi as Dr. Vasudevan * Santhanam as Babu * Upen Patel as John * G.

Rajinikanth was impressed with two of the scripts and agreed to star in the films, which became Sivaji (2007) and Enthiran (2010).

Vogt were in charge of the costume designing of the film's cast. According to Shankar, Azhagan and Aanazhagan were the alternate titles that were kept in mind, but since they were already used, he decided that a single alphabet would be the film's title. Since 'I' also meant beauty and explained the character of the protagonist, the alphabet was finalised to be the film's title. In September 2014, producer and distributor Aascar V Ravichandran, stated the project would cost about , however by October 2014, he and director Shankar was widely quoted as stating the budget would be less than .Director Shankar hires 'Avatar' make-up artistes for 'I' – IBNLive.

But what we didn't expect was that feeling of thrill and intrigue.\\", asserting that \\"Vikram and Shankar have us hooked with the teaser.\\". Nivedita Mishra of the Hindustan Times elaborated in her teaser review, \\"Without doubt, the film's special effects are great by any standards. Now, whether or not, they have been indigenously put together or have been outsourced from the West, the producers alone will know, but just the desire to make a film that gets its production value right yet doesn't overdo it, is good enough. Here's hoping it will ignite a desire among Indians to go for the skies.\\" and praised the spectacular landscapes, edgy camera angles, action sequences before concluding that \\"Shankar has put in a lot of effort to make this magnum opus worth a watch if teasers are to go by.\\" Behindwoods wrote, \\"Anyone who sees this remarkably impactful teaser would keep rewinding what he / she saw, to relive the experience over and over again.\\" The teaser crossed 1 million views in just 12 hours of its release, making it the first Indian film to do so, beating the record set by the teaser of the Bollywood film, Bang Bang! (2014), which crossed 1 million views in 13 hours. It reached 7 million views in 2 weeks after its release, becoming the only Tamil film to cross the mark till date.

For the online roleplaying game company see NetDevil. Borophryne apogon, the netdevil, or greedy seadevil, is a species of leftvent anglerfish known today from the waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean off the Central American coast. It is found at depths down to around . This species grows to a length of TL. A fossil specimen of this species has been found in the Los Angeles Basin dating back to the Late Miocene, some eight million years ago. ==Description== A metamorphosed female Borophryne apogon is globose, and grows to a maximum length of about . The depth of the head is between 40% and 55% of the fish's standard length and the length of the head is between 50% and 60% of the standard length, with the lower jaw being four fifths of the length of the head. Three rows of long, sharp teeth line the jaws and there are up to four teeth on the roof of the mouth. The illicium on the snout is short and the esca on its tip is large with a branching terminal appendage and filaments on the side. There is a rounded protuberance on the forehead, the sphenotic spines (above the eyes) are large in young specimens but become overgrown with skin in older ones, and there is a symphysial spine at the tip of the jaw. The caudal peduncle is particularly short. The head and body are dark reddish-brown, or completely black, and the fins are usually colourless. The dorsal fin and the anal fin both have three soft rays, while the pectoral fins have fifteen to eighteen rays each, and the caudal fin has nine. This anglerfish is similar in appearance to Linophryne, but lacks the barbel on the chin. A free-living metamorphosed male grows to a length of about . It differs from other leftvent anglerfish in having no premaxillae and having large sphenotic spines. The jaws bear no teeth, but there are up to six or seven strong, short placoid scales above and below the mouth which meet when the jaws are closed. The olfactory organs are large and unpigmented, but the rest of the head and body is lightly pigmented and pale brown. ==Distribution== This species is found only in the tropical eastern Pacific. Its range extends from the lower Gulf of California to the Gulf of Panama, in an area delineated by 29°N to 7°N and 113°W to 78°W. It is a deep water fish and has been found in the bathypelagic zone at depths down to about . ==Evolution== A fossil of Borophryne apogon and one of the closely related headlight angler (Linophryne indica) were found in Late Miocene laminated deposits in the eastern sector of the Los Angeles Basin, California, during construction of a metro line subway station in Los Angeles. The assemblage of anglerfish included several other extant species of anglerfish. ==Biology== When a free-living male B. apogon encounters a female he latches onto her belly with his mouth and their tissues gradually fuse, with the male becoming parasitic. Free-living males and unparasitised females never have fully developed gonads, but after fusion, the male's gonads enlarge and he continues to grow, the largest known parasitic male being about long. ==References== Category:Linophrynidae Category:Taxa named by Charles Tate Regan Category:Fish described in 1925 ","title":"Borophryne apogon"},{"id":"35960883","text":"Psakhara () is a village in the Gagra District of Abkhazia. ==See also== * Gagra District ==NotesReferencesGagra District Administration=Other=== Category:Populated places in Gagra District ","title":"Psakhara"},{"id":"35960919","text":"Incheon Korean Air Jumbos () is a South Korean professional volleyball team.

After a long time out of work, and a lengthy spell in the country to recuperate, he decided to change his trade. Being an educated man and something of a literary scholar, he opened a school on the Church Stairs, Gateshead and became a schoolmaster.

On 23 July 2018 he reached a new career-high of no. 142 on the ATP World Tour rankings. He reached his high ranking of No. 1 in ITF Juniors rankingsGianluigi Quinzi, ITF Juniors Profile on 1 January 2013. He is a Junior Grand Slam champion as he won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. ==Personal life== Gianluigi was born in Cittadella on February 1, 1996 and grew up in Porto San Giorgio with his mother Carlotta, a ski racer and handball player, and his father Luca, the president of a local tennis club. His parents, always get too nervous when their son is playing and as a result they are not present to his games, not even in the junior boy's final of 2013 Wimbledon. ==Junior career== 2013 French Open Junior Initially Quinzi applied himself to Alpine skiing, gaining a second place in the championships of the Trentino-Alto Adige; but at seven years old, after leaving other sports as well, he focused his efforts primarily on tennis. At the age of 8 he was noticed by the talent scout Nick Bollettieri who offered him a scholarship to his academy. He participated at the Little Mo, tournament played in Florida which is reserved for Under-10 players, and triumphed printing his name in the Hall of Fame of a tournament won in the past by players such as Serena Williams and Andy Roddick. At thirteen years old, he became the youngest player in the ITF Junior rankings and the next year he triumphed in four tournaments in a row with a series of twenty victories. He started to be known early in Junior ITF tournaments: at age of fourteen - in 2010 - he won the Honduras Junior Bowl, on clay court, by defeating in the final Walner Espinoza 6–0, 6–1, becoming the youngest Italian player to win an ITF Junior tournament. With the excellent results obtained in 2010, Quinzi was nominated Player of the Year, in the category Under-14, by the European Tennis Association; before him, years before, previous nominees for this award have included Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Marin Čilić, Gaël Monfils, Kim Clijsters, Justine Henin and Anna Kournikova. Quinzi obtained his best result in Italy: in Milan he won the Trofeo Bonfiglio in 2012, beating Temür Ismailov in three sets. At the 2012 French Open Junior he was seeded No. 2. He was eliminated in the third round by British tennis player Kyle Edmund; 7–6(1), 1–6, 6–4. At the 2012 Wimbledon Junior the young Italian, No. 3 seed, arrived in the semifinals where he lost to Luke Saville, who was No. 1 in the Junior ITF rankings and the returning champion from 2011. In September, he reached the 2012 US Open Junior quarterfinals, losing in three sets to the Japanese player Yoshihito Nishioka. In September 2012, Quinzi entered in the history of Italian tennis: he won the 2012 Junior Davis Cup with Filippo Baldi: the first time in sport history that Italy won the Junior Davis Cup (in 2011 Italy finished runner-up with Quinzi also playing). On January 1, 2013, Quinzi reached his best ranking of No. 1 in the world in the ITF Junior rankings: he is the first Italian player ever to obtain this result. At 2013 Australian Open Quinzi, seeded No. 2, reached the quarterfinals without losing a set, but there he was defeated by Thanasi Kokkinakis in three sets. In March, Quinzi reached the final of the 43rd Banana Bowl tournament; he lost in three sets to the French player Jean Sebastien Tatlot. The following week he won the 30th Copa Gerdau beating Stefan Kozlov in the final; 6–4, 6–3. At the second Junior Grand Slam of the season, the 2013 French Open, Quinzi, despite some physical problems, arrived into the quarterfinals, where he lost to No. 2 Nikola Milojević 7–6(2), 6–2. However, one month later, Quinzi, seeded sixth, soon reached the semifinals at 2013 Wimbledon, beating 10th seed Tatlot in the third round (6–1, 6–1), and the same Nikola Milojević who beat him on the French clay, prevailing in the quarterfinals (6–4, 6–3). With an outstanding performance Quinzi beat Kyle Edmund in straight sets to reach his first Junior Grand Slam final. In the final, he defeated the Korean, Chung Hyeon, 7–5, 7–6(7–2). He won the title without dropping a set in the entire tournament. Quinzi was the second Italian in sport history to win here; Diego Nargiso was the first to win the title in 1987. At 2013 US Open Quinzi reached the quarterfinals but lost to Thanasi Kokkinakis in three sets. ==Professional career2011–2012: Professional debut=== In September 2011, Quinzi obtained his first ATP point at the 2011 Mazatlán Open beating the Swiss tennis player Luca Margaroli in the first round. His first best result in ITF Men's Circuit went in 2012 Pozzuoli, where he reached the quarterfinals, but he lost to the Italian player Alessio di Mauro. In September 2012, he reached his first semifinal match in the ITF tournament of Manzanillo, in Mexico, beating, with the score of 6–1, 6–0, the same Yoshihito Nishioka who beat him in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Junior US Open, a week before. In the following two months he also reached the semifinals in other 4 ITF tournaments (Santa Cruz, Santiago, Santa Maria and Lins) often defeating players with a higher ranking and older than him. On November 23, 2012 he reached is first ITF final in the tournament of Curico, Chile ($10,000, on clay court), defeating Juan Carlos Saez (world rank No. 464) in the semifinal, but he lost to Guillermo Rivera-Aránguiz in straight sets. Quinzi, at the end of 2012, was world rank No. 561. ===2013=== In 2013 Quinzi obtained his first big professional result in March: in the first ITF Futures tournament he took part, in Bogotá, he soon reached his second career final, beating high-ranked players than him. Here he lost to Carlos Salamanca (three hundred position ahead of him in the ATP rankings) in straight sets. In April Quinzi officially entered in the Top 500, becoming the youngest player of the ATP rankings among the first 500. He then received a wild card to enter the main draw of the 2013 Rai Open, the first clay court Challenger tournament of the season played in Italy, but he lost in the first round to former Top 100 player Frederico Gil in three sets. The following week he took part to his second ITF tournament of the season, in Sharm El Sheik; he reached his third career ITF final without losing a set. He lost to Mohamed Safwat in three sets. Two weeks later, again in Egypt, Quinzi reached the semifinals of the F6 Futures tournament on clay court, but he lost to Kevin Krawietz. At the end of may Quinzi played his fourth ITF tournament of the season, in Casablanca ($10.000, clay). After beating the n.1 seed Sergio Gutierrez-Ferrol (former Top 200 on the ATP rankings) in the quarterfinals, and after receiving a walkover in the semifinals, Quinzi reached his fourth career final in an ITF tournament (the third in 2013, in only four tournaments played). Here he won his first career title beating in three sets Lamine Ouahab (former world n.114) and entered, for the first time, the Top 400 of the ATP World rankings. In July, Quinzi received a wildcard to join the main draw of the 2013 Guzzini Challenger: here he reached his first win in a Challenger tournament, beating fellow Italian Stefano Travaglia in three sets, but lost in the second round to Flavio Cipolla former n.70 in the world. In August Quinzi took part to two other Challenger tournaments in Italy but lost in the first round to Italian Top 100 players Filippo Volandri and Paolo Lorenzi. In September Quinzi continued playing in ATP Challenger Tour, taking part to some tournaments in South America: at 2013 Quito Challenger Quinzi lost in the second round to eventual semifinalist Giovanni Lapentti; in Porto Alegre, one week later, he entered the main draw as a qualifier and stunned Gastão Elias (world rank No. 129) in the first round, beating him with a 6–3 6–4. Quinzi then reached for the first time the quarterfinals round on an ATP Challenger Tour tournament, defeating Leonardo Kirche 6–2 6–2, but lost in three sets to Pedro Sousa. In November, in Colombia, Quinzi beat again Gastão Elias with a stunning 6–2 6–0 to reach the second round of the 2013 Challenger Ciudad de Guayaquil where he overtook Bolivian player Hugo Dellien in straight sets. In the quarterfinals he defeated Michael Linzer to reach for the first time the semifinals in a Challenger tournament; he failed to reach the final losing in three sets to former world rank No. 51 Leonardo Mayer. He finished the season losing to Pavel Krainik in the semifinals of a Future tournament in Mérida, Mexico. At the end of 2013, Quinzi was world rank No. 328. ===2014=== Quinzi in Oldenzaal (2015) Quinzi started the season in Zagreb where he obtained his first ATP World Tour victory beating Yannick Mertens in straight sets in the qualifying draw of the 2014 PBZ Zagreb Indoors. Anyway, he lost to Pedja Krstin in the following round. Then Quinzi played in Bergamo having received a wildcard into the singles main draw of the 2014 Trofeo Faip–Perrel where he fell in the first round. In the following months Quinzi took part to other tournaments around the world, without obtaining any significant result: he lost in the first round of the 2014 All Japan Indoor Tennis Championships; then he was defeated by Argentine player Facundo Argüello in the second round of the 2014 Challenger ATP Cachantún Cup and in the first round of the 2014 Rome Open by Taro Daniel. In May, after the divorce from his coach Eduardo Medica, Quinzi obtained his best results in 2014, capturing three $10,000 ITF tournaments in three weeks - and winning 15 matches in a row: in Galați, Romania, he beat Romanian Vasile Antonescu, in Safi, Morocco, he beat Hugo Dellien 6–2, 6–2 (capturing the title without losing a set) and then in Casablanca he defeated Gianni Mina in straight sets. With these results he got closer to the ATP's Top 300 rankings. Later in the year, in August, a wrist injury stopped Quinzi's climb of the ATP rankings. After some disappointing results, in November Quinzi reached the quarterfinals of the 2014 Uruguay Open losing in straight sets to Pedro Cachin; he finished the season in Argentina, where he took part at two ITF events in Mendoza (losing to eventual champion Grzegorz Panfil in the semifinals, and falling in the first round the following week). At the end of 2014 (also because of the injury in the second part of the season) Quinzi was world rank No. 424. ===2015=== At the end of January Quinzi took part at his first 2015 tournament in Palm Coast: playing on clay, the Italian reached the quarterfinals of the $10.000 ITF event, where he was defeated by eventual finalist Patricio Heras. A couple of weeks later, Quinzi won his fifth Future tournament of his career, beating Federico Coria with the score of 6–4, 6–4 on the green clay of Sunrise (Florida). At the 2015 Argentina Open in Buenos Aires he lost to Thiago Monteiro in straight sets in the second round of the qualifying draw; in March the Italian qualified for the main draw of the 2015 Challenger ATP Cachantún Cup but lost in the first round to Juan Ignacio Londero. Quinzi then obtained a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the Miami Masters, but he was defeated 6–4, 4–6, 6–2 by Thiemo de Bakker. In April he reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 Tennis Napoli Cup as a wildcard beating the No. 3 seed and world No. 104 Blaž Rola 6–3, 6–1 and fellow Italian Flavio Cipolla (former Top 100 player) in straight sets in the first two rounds; he lost to Marco Cecchinato at the third set tiebreak. ===2017=== After being awarded a wild card thanks to a qualifying tournament, Quinzi took part in the first edition of the Next Gen ATP Finals, held in Milan, Italy. ==Career statisticsATP Challenger Tour and ITF Futures finals=== Singles: 18 (13–5) {class= style=font- size:97% !Legend -bgcolor=moccasin ATP Challenger Tour (2–1) -bgcolor=cffcff ITF Futures (11–4) } {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% !Outcome !No. !Date !width=200Tournament !Surface !width=200Opponent !Score - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up 1. 24 November 2012 Curicó, Chile Clay  Guillermo Rivera-Aránguiz 4–6, 4–6 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up 2. 9 March 2013 Bogotá, Colombia Clay  Carlos Salamanca  6–7(3–7), 6–7(2–7) - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up 3. 28 April 2013 Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt Clay  Mohamed Safwat  2–6, 6–1, 3–6 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=98FB98Winner 1. 1 June 2013 Casablanca, Morocco Clay  Lamine Ouahab  7–6(7–2), 1–6, 6-4 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=98FB98Winner 2. 17 May 2014 Galați, Romania Clay  Vasile Antonescu 6–3, 2–6, 6–3 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=98FB98Winner 3. 24 May 2014 Safi, Morocco Clay  Hugo Dellien 6–2, 6–2 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=98FB98Winner 4. 31 May 2014 Casablanca, Morocco Clay  Gianni Mina 6–2, 6–3 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=98FB98Winner 5. 15 February 2015 Sunrise, United States Clay  Federico Coria 6–4, 6–4 -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  6.  24 August 2015  Oldenzaal, Netherlands  Clay  Jesse Huta Galung  7–5, 2–0 ret. -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  7.  24 April 2016  Szeged, Hungary  Clay  Grzegorz Panfil  6–3, 7–5 -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  8.  29 May 2016  Kiseljak, Bosnia & Herzegovina  Clay  Dejan Katić  6–2, 6–4 - bgcolor=cffcff bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up  4.  29 October 2016  Oslo, Norway  Hard (i)  Lucas Miedler 2–6, 4–6 -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  9.  5 November 2016  Oslo, Norway (2)  Hard (i)  Casper Ruud  6–4, 6–2 -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  10.  14 January 2018  Antalya, Turkey  Hard  Marc Sieber  3–6, 6–3, 6–3 -cffcff;\\"  98fb98;\\"Winner  11.  11 February 2018  Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt (2)  Hard  Jaroslav Pospisil  6–2, 6–4 -bgcolor=moccasin  98fb98;\\"Winner  1.  29 April 2018  Francavilla, Italy  Clay  Casper Ruud  6–4, 6–1 -bgcolor=moccasin  98fb98;\\"Winner  2.  27 May 2018  Mestre, Italy  Clay  Gian Marco Moroni  6–2, 6–2 -bgcolor=moccasin bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up  1.  15 July 2018  Perugia, Italy  Clay  Ulises Blanch  5–7, 2–6 } Doubles: 4 (2–2) {class= style=font-size:97% !Legend -bgcolor=moccasin Challengers (0–1) -bgcolor=CFFCFF Futures (2–1) } {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% !Outcome !No. !Date !Tournament !Surface !Partner !Opponents !Score -bgcolor=moccasin bgcolor=\\"FFA07A\\"Runner–up 1.

The term 'contemplative psychology' therefore does not refer to academic psychological theory about contemplation, religion or religious behavior. It refers to the psychological insights and methods that are - often implicitly - present in the vision and practice of religions and that clarify and guide ones contemplative or religious development\\" (p. 82).Han de Wit, \\"Contemplative psychology addresses the question of how we could intelligently approach and understand human life-experience\\" (p. 83). == Background == The term Contemplative Psychology was coined by Han F. De Wit in 1991 when he, a theoretical psychologist at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, published his pioneering book Contemplative Psychology. The goal of this project was to \\"establish a dialogue between contemplative psychology and academic psychology\\" (p. 233). As a first step Han did not offer a systematic contemplative psychology but rather he suggested a \\"framework in which a full-fledged contemplative psychology may be developed\\" (p. 3). Is this work he outlines the \\"contours and the view of contemplative psychology\\" (p. 4). As Han develops the concept, his first point is to illustrate \\"a position from which the 'excavation' and 'exposure' of the contemplative psychologies seems possible\\" (p. 115) and to \\"make explicit and clarify the nature and position of the psychological know- how that contemplative traditions contain\\" (p. 14) This implied a comparative study of different religious and contemplative traditions in the belief that there was enough in common between these traditions to make \\"the search for a general contemplative psychological perspective and approach\\" meaningful (p. 4). Contemplative psychology became visible in the Western sphere of psychology when researchers began studying the methods used to help individuals understand their own mind, emotions, and motivations. The goal of these practices is to improve the quality of one's own life (and, by extension, the quality of other people's lives). Research began at Naropa University, and was developed extensively by Han himself. Thus far, mindfulness has been the contemplative practice of most research.Exploring how contemplative practices can inform counselling psychology and counsellor training. (2013). Counselling and Spirituality, 115-142. Mindfulness is a practice that allows one to exist in the present moment without being judgmental of it.Kabat-Zinn, J. (2005). Full catastrophe living: Using the wisdom of the body and mind to face stress, pain, and illness (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Bantam Dell. This meditative absorption, often referred to as samadhi in many eastern traditions, is the equivalent of contemplation in Western traditions. Gerald G. May expands on this notion in his book Will and Spirit by differentiating between willfulness and willingness. Willfulness, he explains, is one's attempted mastery over the psyche, while willingness is a surrender of one's self to a way of being. Contemplative practices allow persons to cultivate meaningful experiences intrinsic to religious and spiritual traditions that are virtually absent in modern, mechanistic psychology alone.May, G. (1983). Will and spirit: A contemplative psychology. San Francisco: Harper & Row. === Understanding contemplative traditions === For Han, the project of defining a contemplative psychology begins with the excavation and explication of the \\"psychology embedded in various contemplative traditions (although often in an implicit and not fully developed state); to compare these different psychologies and derive more general rules from them; and to refine and systematize these findings further through a confrontation with contemporary academic psychology\\" (p. 84). Thus Han did not create the concept of contemplative psychology from scratch. It emerged as a common techne in various religious and secular traditions. Han develops three concepts of contemplative tradition: monastic tradition, lay tradition and temporal (non-religious) tradition. Monastic tradition is \\"a context in which people devote their whole life to the practice of a religious discipline and to the spiritual exercises that are part of it\\" (p. 84). People of the monastic traditions typically live with a group of individuals that is fairly separate from the surrounding society. \\"Their daily life activities are permeated by a discipline that is supposed to develop and sustain religious or spiritual growth\\" (p. 84). These individuals are typically trained to possess a practical knowledge of their particular tradition and there role is to educate people in the religious view of the world. \\"This know how is psychological and methodological in nature\\" (p. 84). It is a form of contemplative psychology. Lay traditions are \\"religious disciplines that are practiced in the context of normal every day life\\" (p. 84). There are two particular views on lay tradition practice. One is that religious practice in everyday life brings one closer to a monastic tradition and the other is that daily life is the ultimate monastery and that daily practice is the monastic practice brought into everyday lived experiences. In either view there is psychological knowledge that could be considered contemplative. Temporal (non- religious) traditions are \\"contemplative traditions could be 'non religious', that is without a connection with a particular religion\\" (p. 84). Despite an informal nature these traditions contain \\"a discipline based on a particular kind of psychological knowledge, that guides its practitioners towards the realization of the highest human values\\" (p. 84). The assumption of contemplative psychology is that contemplative traditions have in common \\"some normative anthropology, some notion of 'materialistic man' or 'fallen man' and the idea that human beings have the possibility to uplift themselves and others from their' corrupted state' towards what is often called 'enlightenment'\\"(p. 84). Contemplative psychology gathers its knowledge base from the comparative analysis of experiential knowledge across contemplative traditions. == Differences from the psychology of religion and psychology in general== > \\"If we would interpret the preposition ‘of’ in the possessive sense of > 'belonging to', then contemplative psychology would definitely be a > psychology of religion, but the academic ‘psychology of religion’ would not. > For the standard interpretation of the preposition ‘of' in ‘psychology of > religion’ is rather in the direction of ‘about’ than in the direction of > ‘belonging to’. And conventional psychology about religion is not and does > not intend to be a psychology belonging to religion\\" (p.86). Thus contemplative psychology is a psychology of first-person experience. The psychology of religion (and scientific psychology) is a psychology about its object of study, it is a third-person psychology. The major difference is epistemological. The first-person nature of contemplative psychology values the knowledge which comes from private, personal experience. \\"It has its own notion of objectivity (see e.g. the ‘acid test of truth’ in Roberts, 1985: 171)\\" (p.86). The psychology of religion and scientific psychology in general \\"tend to shun away from research into experience that is only available in the first-person sense. For the private character of first-person experience seems to exclude ‘objectivity’ as defined in third person methodology\\" (p. 86). === Differing objectives === > \\"The object of contemplative psychology is the totality of human existence > or human experience. The central question is: what is the place of all > aspects of human life within the contemplative perspective and its > development? How could one deal with all these aspects in a way that > furthers one’s contemplative development\\" (p.87)? > \\"The object of scientific psychology of religion is religion itself, which > is viewed as one among the many non-religious aspects of human life. The > central question here is: how could we gain a third-person psychological > understanding of religious phenomena and how are these causally related to > other non-religious phenomena\\" (p.87)? === Differing aims === The aim of contemplative psychology as a field of study is a way of life. It pursues knowledge about living \\"in the first-person sense of being wise [and] being free from confusion and ignorance\\" (p. 87). The aim of psychology of religion is scientific knowledge, that is true information about its object of study. \\"This knowledge is primarily representational and indirect and as such distinct from (at a distance of) what it represents\\"(p. 87). === Differing methodology === Because of the difference in epistemological bases there is also differentiation between the methods of acquiring the differing types of knowledge. The methods of contemplative psychologies are in fact practices and disciplines like (meditation, contemplation, prayer) that bring about what the contemplative tradition views the existentential path towards the above-mentioned aims.\\" Han de Wit characterizes these practices as awareness strategies that are aimed at the \\"discipline of becoming aware on the spot of one’s working basis\\" (p. 111). The methods of psychology of religion consist of the empirical scientific method, which are characterized by Han de Wit as conceptual strategies, as they aim for the development of conceptual knowledge that represents human behavior.\\" == Uses == An example of using contemplative psychology would be using Buddhist concepts such as brilliant sanity (or buddha-nature), ego, mindfulness, and interconnectedness as framework for interpreting psychological experiences, as is done in the contemplative counseling program at Naropa university.Nimmanheminda, S., Unger, R., Abigail, L., & Mathew, H. (n.d.). (2010). Group therapy training at Naropa University's contemplative counseling psychology program. Group, 34(4), 309-318. The same could be applied to other faiths, as May used the Christian concept of Grace as a framework for explaining our psychological surrender to a cosmic order. ==References Further reading == Roberts, B.

Though Packard had introduced its Twin-Six many years earlier it was to be a decade or more before luxury manufacturers like Rolls-Royce, Hispano-Suiza, Lincoln, Voisin and Lagonda made their own (and Packard returned to it). In fact by the mid-1930s flexible engine mountings and improved carburation had made so many cylinders unnecessary. What did return them to a certain level of popularity was the push for higher performance requiring higher crankshaft speeds. Daimler introduced their first 26 hp straight-eight in mid-1934 and their last (poppet valve) V12s were built in 1937 or 1938. From 1929 Daimler Double-Sixes were distinguishable from the six-cylinder cars by a chromium bar down the centre of the radiator. A similar distinguishing mark was placed on the later Jaguar-made versions. Aside from Daimler only Voisin in France ever attempted production of a sleeve-valve V12 engine. Voisin's production—between 1929 and 1937—was \\"minimal and spasmodic\\".

In November 1930 a car was shipped to Edsel Ford with the new Daimler transmission. It aroused so much interest Cadillac's chief engineer, Ernest Seaholm, came to the following Olympia show and bought another for technical investigation. It inspired Earl Thompson, who invented syncromesh, to develop the Hydramatic transmission. This light double-six was one of the first cars designed using ergonomics. Switches buttons and stalks were all placed within finger tip reach of the driver and accessible without taking hands from the wheel. The cars would run up to before requiring engine decarbonisation. ===Design changes=== Engine :Cylinder block a one-piece light alloy casting :Distributors were moved to the back of the engine :Cover plates provided in the crankcase which could be removed to reveal the sleeve-eccentric links :Carburettors moved forward :Lubrication by two submerged helical-gear pumps, one feeding all moving parts, the other circulating oil through the oil radiator :Oil radiator to maintain a constant :Cold viscid oil forced open valves allowing oil into troughs below the big-ends to provide cold-start splash lubrication of the sleeves :Hand-operated oil cleaner :Water pumps on outside of each cylinder bank mounted in tandem with dynamos This model was usually supplied with a taller and more slender radiator.

Petrol consumption was not so savage as might have been expected at 10 miles per gallon. \\"2 to 82 mph in top gear in the highest degree of smoothness and quietness\\" said The Autocar \\". . . fortunate beings will leisurely survey the moving surface of the earth through the windows of their Daimler Double-Sixes as they pass onward in silent dignity\\". A letter from Tony Bird in the January 1967 issue of Motor Sport recounted how Double-Six models could develop violent front axle \\"wheel wobble\\" which could only be overcome by stopping the car. ==Bodies== Bodies were all mounted after the Daimler pattern on a separate frame flexibly held. ==Presence== A contemporary press report remarked that \\"when the Double-Six arrives at the door there is no obvious pomp and circumstance. Here is a car that looks clean-cut and aristocratic in its speckless grey paintwork. It is not until one comes close to the car that its great size is realised. The Daimler bonnet is nearly level with the chin of the observer.\\" Autocar ===Difficulties=== William Boddy of Motor Sport commented that the difficulty with sleeve valves was lubrication. So much oil near the combustion chambers led to a gummy engine prone to seize if left standing for any length of time. Attempts to tow-start invariably led to sleeve-driving link breakage if not damage to the sleeves. There was also difficulty in timing the sleeves once pistons had been out of the block and also synchronising carburation and ignition between the two banks of cylinders. Daimler introduced their new Straight-Eight in 1934 and Double- Sixes slipped slowly from the catalogue. ==NotesFootnotes=Citations=References== * * * ==External links== Images not otherwise available * Double-Six hire car and driver and another Daimler, 1937 * Double- Six 50 four-seater drophead coupé YouTube * Double-Six Thirty coupé on the road * Double-Six Fifty on the road Double-Six sleeve-valve V12 Category:Gasoline engines by model Category:Sleeve valve engines ","title":"Daimler Double-Six sleeve-valve V12"},{"id":"35961200","text":"Exel Composites Oyj (formerly known as Exel Oyj) is a Finnish technology company that designs, manufactures and markets composite profiles and tubes for industrial applications.

True to its name, the charm of this village lies in its hidden accessibility from regular run-of-the-mill tourist radar. It borrows its name from two words in Hindi Devanagri script..'Har' + 'Tola'. 'Har' means Lord Shiva{a revered Hindu God}and 'tola' means the locale where one of a kind dwell. Thus, 'Hartola' denotes the locale where Lord Shiva dwelled. A quaint and ancient Shiva temple up in the mountain here lends credence to this meaning. The sound of bells from this temple at a distance, coupled with the chirping of mountain birds, is music to one's ears while the eyes feast on a panoramic view of the Himalayan peaks. The view from Hartola rivals the views from Mukhteshwar, a small mountain village that was developed with some infrastructure by the British. This is because Hartola, also atop a mountain ridge, has a closer view of the Indian and Nepal range of the Himalayas when compared with Mukhteshwar. Folklore has it that during the British period in India, a shepherd boy from Almora, who went grazing his cattle in the meadows in the mountains, accidentally discovered a picture- post-card perfect and serene hamlet that spread in a radius of barely six kilometers. While he set his cattle free to graze in the green meadows and took his afternoon siesta, the young shepherd boy witnessed the appearance of Lord Shiva in his dream. HISTORY: Kumaon region, which houses the district of Nainital, was under the rule of the Gorkhas before being overtaken by the Chand dynasty. The area of Hartola was owned by some members of the Rana dynasty, which ruled the Kingdom of Nepal from 1846 AD until 1951 AD. The name of the Queen who held Hartola as her estate was Rani Prem Pal. While relocating to Nepal, Rani Prem Pal 'gave away' this heavenly property to loyalists of her family who had helped her maintain the estate and the Shiva temple. What followed later was a legal battle in the High Court of Nainital between the descendants of the Queen, who was the 'owner', and the families who had received her estate. The 'gift' was upheld by the High Court as an instrument of exchange and the descendants of the victorious family now owns one of the most enviable Apple orchards, in terms of its flat setting on top of the mountain, facing the majestic Himalayas. From the centre of the 180 degrees, one can views the snow-clad Nandadevi and Trishul peaks. CULTIVATION & BEST TIME TO VISIT: Hartola is home to organic cultivation of Apple, Plum, Peach, Apricot and now also Walnut trees. It is worth visiting any time of the year, including winter, when snowfall paints this beautiful hamlet in pure white while snowflakes fall on a hint of Apple blossoms awaiting to appear as the snow melts away. The best time to visit here for a view of the peaks is September & October, but for fruit lovers the season is summer. July and August sees this hamlet lush green. Hartola sits at a geographical altitude of around 8345 ft, making it an ideal fruit-laden destination for prospective home-buyers, tourists, bird-watchers and orchard lovers. A new link road through village Lahauli will link Hartola to Almora and Ranikhet vide a shorter route than the present detour through Ramgarh. This route will turn this beautiful hamlet into a destination, which had in the past remained a poor cousin of Mukhteshwar- despite offering a more closer & thereby a more spectacular view of the Himalayan range. Situated at a distance of 54 kilometers from Nainital, nearby places around Hartola are Nathuakhan {10 Kms}andRamgarh.Hartola The village has a population of about 680. The village is adjoining Mukteshwar forest reserve, which has the largest population of Banjh (Himalayan oak) along with Burash, Deodaar trees and various Himalayan flora & fauna. Located at a distance of 342 Kms by road from Delhi, capital city of India, the nearest rail-head is Kathgodam(72Kms) from where a taxi takes two and a half hours to reach this hamlet. One drives through a forest reserve of Deodaar trees to land straight on the icing of the cake nestled in Himalayan wonderland.

Following the split of his previous band The Format, lead singer Nate Ruess formed Fun in 2008 with musicians Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff, both of whom had previously toured with The Format. Fun began recording sessions for their debut album in September 2008 and embarked on a North American tour the following month. In May 2009, they issued their debut single, \\"At Least I'm Not as Sad (As I Used to Be)\\". Aim and Ignite, the band's first full-length album, was released by Nettwerk Records on August 25, 2009 and peaked at number 71 on the United States Billboard 200 chart. The album produced an additional two singles, \\"All the Pretty Girls\\" and \\"Walking the Dog\\", which were then followed by the release of the single \\"C'mon\\", a collaboration with American alternative rock band Panic! at the Disco. The band's single \\"We Are Young\\", featuring American R&B; singer Janelle Monáe, was released in September 2011, beginning a steady rise in popularity after gaining attention on online media and being covered on the television series Glee. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in December, becoming the band's first single to enter a national record chart. The song's use in a Chevrolet Sonic Super Bowl commercial further increased sales of the song, and it eventually topped the Hot 100 and hit the top ten in multiple other countries, including Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It has become one of the best-selling singles of all-time, with sales of over 9.3 million copies. The band's second studio album, Some Nights, was released by Fueled by Ramen on February 21, 2012; it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album's title track was released as its second single and peaked at number three on the Hot 100, while also reaching the top ten on other national singles charts. \\"Carry On\\", \\"Why Am I the One\\", and \\"All Alone\\" followed as the next three singles from Some Nights. ==Studio albums== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Certifications - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US Alt. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US Rock ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" AUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" AUT ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" CAN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" IRL ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" NZ ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" SWE ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" Aim and Ignite  * Released: August 25, 2009 * Label: Nettwerk * Formats: CD, LP, digital download  71  20  23  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  * US: 74,000  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Some Nights  * Released: February 21, 2012 * Label: Fueled by Ramen * Formats: CD, LP, digital download  3  1  1  2  11  5  8  3  36  4  * US: 1,600,000  * RIAA: 3× Platinum * ARIA: Platinum * BPI: Platinum * GLF: Gold * IRMA: Platinum * MC: Platinum * RMNZ: Platinum -  colspan=\\"14\\" style=\\"font- size:90%\\" \\"—\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } ==Extended plays== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of extended plays, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US Alt. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:85%;\\" US Rock - ! scope=\\"row\\" Fun.

Signage in Adrian proudly declares a 1139-mile distance to each original US 66 endpoint; the café's slogan is \\"when you're here, you're halfway there\\". Fran Houser, owner of the Midpoint Café from 1990 until 2012, is the basis for Flo of \\"Flo's V-8 Café\\" in Cars. ==History== Various US 66 markers posted outside the Midpoint Café The café, built in 1928 and expanded in 1947, operated 24 hours a day during Route 66's heyday and is the oldest continuously operating Route 66 café between Amarillo, Texas and Tucumcari, New Mexico. Its origins can be traced to a one- room, dirt-floor brick café known as Zella's, built by Jeannie VanderWort and leased to Zella Prin. The restaurant changed hands several times. Dub Edmunds and Jesse Fincher acquired the property in 1956, operating it and an adjacent filling station as Jesse's Café until 1976. It became well known for its hot, fresh home-made pies. Adrian was bypassed by Interstate 40 in 1969, leading to an abrupt decline in traffic through the village.Texas Department of Transportation, Highway Designation File - State Highway Loop 550 Interstate 40 in Texas replaced US 66 in-place except within individual towns, which were bypassed by retaining the old main street as a business loop. Most of Route 66 in Texas was turned into frontage road for the new Interstate highway or disappeared entirely. As business declined, the local Adrian population dropped to approximately 220 in the late 20th century and an estimated 149 in 2008. The café was sold in 1976 to Terry and Peggy Creitz as Peggy's Café; a subsequent owner changed the name to Rachel's. Fran Houser purchased the business, naming it the Adrian Café, in 1990. Her original plan was to establish an antique shop at the site. ==Renaissance== Signage declares Adrian TX as midpoint of US 66 Efforts to put \\"Historic Route 66\\" back on the map date to 1987, with Angel Delgadillo's Arizona Historic Route 66 Association obtaining historic signage on Arizona State Route 66. Other US Route 66 states soon followed, using the \\"Route 66\\" brand to attract visitors from as far afield as Europe and Australia. The Midpoint Café's current name and identity were adopted in 1995 on the advice of travel author and US Route 66 Association founder Tom Snyder. The shop began selling antiques on consignment by 1997 alongside its \\"nostalgia food\\" menu of breakfasts, hamburgers and the homemade desserts which it calls \\"Ugly Crust Pies\\". The term \\"ugly crust\\" was coined by Joann Harwell, Midpoint Café's pastry chef, who would create various tasty, freshly baked pies (pecan, chocolate chip, apple, lemon meringue and chocolate) using her grandmother's recipe, only to lament that the crusts looked better when her grandmother had made the same pies years ago. Flo's V8 Café at Disney California Adventure. In 2001, the roadside café received a visit from Pixar. Fifteen people in a group of rented longhorn Cadillac limousines meticulously photographed landmarks and interviewed Route 66 personalities in five US states, including the between Peach Springs, Arizona and Baxter Springs, Kansas. This research was the basis for the town of Radiator Springs in the 2006 animated film Cars. The Flo, Mia and Tia characters, based on Midpoint Café proprietor Fran Houser and two servers at the restaurant – sisters Mary Lou and Christina Mendez – appear in the film at \\"Flo's V-8 Café\\". As a drive-in restaurant for anthropomorphic cars, the automotive-themed Flo's V-8 Café became a filling station which boasts \\"the finest fuel on Route 66\\". Fran Houser and the Midpoint Café as \\"home of the ugly crust pie\\" are acknowledged in the film's credits. The Disney California Adventure park returns the café as a conventional restaurant, reinstating the legendary \\"ugly crust pie\\" recipe to the menu. Fran Houser retired from the café in 2012, retaining the adjacent former filling station for use as Sunflower Station, an antique and souvenir shop to continue to serve seasonal travellers on US Route 66. == References == Category:Buildings and structures on U.S. Route 66 Category:Restaurants established in 1928 Category:Restaurants in Texas Category:U.S. Route 66 in Texas Category:1928 establishments in Texas ","title":"Midpoint Café"},{"id":"35961237","text":"Willem Carel Mauve Willem Carel Mauve's name as \\"teacher, called 1839\\" in the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem Willem Carel Mauve (2 February 1803, Rotterdam - 24 February 1869, Haarlem), was a Mennonite minister and writer.

It is a highly inflected language, with fairly complex noun phrase structure and word modifications. Nouns and pronouns are declined, and phrasal nouns also undergo an analogous declension. ==Word order== Mizo declarative word order is Object-subject-verb, as in: { - Sava birdka Ihmu seeSava ka hmu I see a bird'' - Thing firewooda hepú carriesThing a pú He carries firewood - } ==Nouns== There is no grammatical gender in Mizo language, although some animals, birds etc. have names which contain one of the suffixes -nu, which means female, or -pa which means male. Examples include chingpirinu (a type of big owl), kawrnu (a type of cicada), thangfènpa (a nocturnal bird).Chhangte, Lalnunthangi, The Grammar of Simple Clauses in Mizo ===Non-derived nouns=== Mizo is an agglutinative language in which it is rare to find morphologically simple, non-derived nouns. However, common everyday objects and domestic animals tend to fall in this category, that is, the category of morphologically simple, non-derived nouns. For example, { - vạwk pig - ịp bag/sack - tláng mountain - sǎm hair - ár chicken - lụi river - } ===Derived nouns=== The most common form of noun is that of derived, morphologically complex, poly-syllabic nouns. Most abstract nouns belong to this category, and so do wild animals and other less common objects. Examples include { - 1. sa- animalmak strange→samak rhinoceros -  - 2. fa- offspringnu female→fanu daughter - 3. süal- wickedna -ness→sùalna wickedness - 4. mäwl- stupidna -ness→màwlna stupidity - } ===Pluralisation=== Nouns are pluralised by the addition of one of the suffixes -te, -ho, -teho and -hote. However, a non-pluralised noun can have the sense of a pluralised noun, and common nouns are usually not pluralised, as in: { - Sava tamdeuhkahmùrowspan=\\"2\\"Sava tam deuh ka hmu I see a lot of birds - bird/smanyveryIsee - } Here sava is not pluralised to savate or savaho; rather, sava functions as a plural. ===Declension of nouns=== Nouns are declined into cases as follows (here we show the tones in accordance with the usage in Mizo Wiktionary, which is an extension of the common usage in Mizo newspapers such as Vanglaini and monthlies such as Lengzem chanchinbu):This usage adapts Zoppen Club's usage. { - !Noun (Nominative case)!!Genitive case!!Accusative case!!Ergative caseInstrumental case - nụlá the/a girlnụla the/a girl'snụlá the/a girlnụláịn (by) the/a girl nụláin using/with a girl - tǔi watertǔi tǔituiịntuiin - } Proper nouns are also declined in the same manner: { - !Noun (Nominative case)!!Genitive case!!Accusative case!!Ergative caseInstrumental case - ThangạThangaThangạThangȧ'nThangạ-in/Thangạ hmangin - } ===Nominalisation=== Verbs and adjectives are nominalised by suffixing -na, and adjectives can also be nominalised by suffixing -zia. For example: { - !Verb!!Adjective!!Nominalisation by -na!!Nominalisation by -zia' - kal kạlna -  süalsùalna -  süal sùalzìa - vùavûakna - } When -na is suffixed to a transitive verb then the resulting noun means either the instrument with which the action described by the verb is achieved, or the object/sufferer of the action or the point of action of the verb. For example, vùa means to beat/strike with a stick, and vûakna means a whip, an object with which one can beat, or a point or place where the beating takes place, a point where something is beaten. When -na is suffixed to an intransitive verb, then the resulting noun means a place etc. through which the action can take place. For example, kal means to go, kalna means where something/someone goes or can go, way, path. For example: { - A kalna kan hre lo→We do not know where he went/where he has gone. - Hei chu a kalna dik a ni lo tawp mai!→This is definitely not the right way. - } When -zia is suffixed to an adjective, the resulting noun means the condition of having the quality described by the adjective. For example, süal means evil, sùalzìa' means sinfulness, evilness. ===Agentiviser=== The suffix -tu in Mizo ṭawng is equivalent to the suffix -er or -or in English, as in: { - püan \\" ṭhui→to sew a cloth - püanṭhuitu→tailor - véng→to protect - véngtû→protector - } ==PronounsForms=== All Mizo pronouns occur in two forms, namely in free form and clitic form: { - !Free form!!Clitic form - kei(I)ka (I) - keimah (I)This form is also used as the accusative. - keini (we)kan (we) - keimahni (we) - nang (you, singular)i (you, singular) - nangmah (you) - nangni (you, plural)in (you, plural) - nangmahni (you, plural) - ani (he, she, it)a (he, she, it) - amah (he, she, it) - anni (they)an (they) - anmahni (they) - } The free form is mostly used for emphasis, and has to be used in conjunction with either the clitic form or an appropriate pronominal particle, as shown in the following examples: # Kei (=I free form) ka (=I clitic form)lo tel ve kher a ngai em?. This is a somewhat emphatic way of saying Ka lo tel ve kher a ngai em? # Nangni (=you pl., free form) in (you pl., clitic form) zo tawh em? This is a somewhat emphatic way of saying Nangni in zo tawh em? # Ani (he/she) a (s/he) kal ve chuan a ṭha lo vang. The clitic form is also used as a genitive form of the pronoun. ===Declension=== Mizo pronouns, like Mizo nouns, are declined into cases as follows: { - ! !!Pronoun (Nominative case)!!Genitive case!!Accusative case!!Ergative case - !rowspan=\\"7\\"clitic form - kakami, minkeimahin=keima'n - kankanminkeimahni- in=keimahnin - iichenangmahin=nangma'n - ininche unangmahni- in=nangmahnin - aaamahamahin=ama'n - anananmahnianmahni- in=anmahni'n - !rowspan=\\"7\\"free form - keikeimakeimah, keimah minkeimahin=keima'n - keimahkeimakeimah, keimah minkeimahin=keima'n - keinikeinikeini, keini minkeini-in=keini'n - keimahnikeimahnikeimahni, keimahni minkeimahni-in=keimahni'n - annianniannianni'n - anmahnianmahnianmahnianmahni-in=anmahni'n - } ==AdjectivesAttributive=== Mizo adjectives (Mizo: hrilhfiahna), when used attributively, follow the nouns they describe, as follows: { - rowspan=\\"2\\"1. naupangfel rowspan=\\"2\\"a good child - childgood - rowspan=\\"2\\"2. lehkhabuchhiartlâk rowspan=\\"2\\"a readable book - bookreadable - rowspan=\\"2\\"3.hmasawnnachhenfâkawm rowspan=\\"2\\"sustainable development - developmentsustainable - rowspan=\\"2\\"2. artuipum ruk rowspan=\\"2\\"six eggs - eggsix - } ===Predicative=== When used predicatively, Mizo adjectives are syntactically verbs, being usually preceded by the subject pronoun clitics, as in: { - A fel S/he or it is good - A ṭha It is good - } In these two sentences, a is the subject pronoun clitic, and the adjectives fel and ṭha function as verbs (syntactically). ===Adjective sequences=== When adjectives follow each other, the preferred order is the following: # color # quality or opinion # size # shape as in :Puan sen (color) mawi (quality) hlai (size) bial (shape) deuh. ===Quantifiers=== The most common quantifiers in Mizo ṭawng are zawng zawng (all/each and every), ṭhenkhat (some [of a whole]), väi (all/every), zà (all/every). Some examples are given below: { - 1. varak duckzawng zawng all!colspan=\\"2\\"All the ducks - 2. kan wezà all!colspan=\\"2\\"All of us - } ==VerbsOccurrence=== Verbs (Mizo: thiltih) and verb phrases occur last in a sentence. Since adjectives can function as verbs, it is common in sentences to have no true verb, as in: :A fel vek mai ang :A dik vêl vek! In these two sentences, the adjectives fel and dik function syntactically as verbs, and there are no other verbs in either of them. ===Tense=== Mizo verbs are not conjugated by changing the desinence. The tense is clarified by the aspect and the addition of conjugating particles, such as *ang (for forming simple future), *tawh (for forming simple past and past perfect), *mék (for forming progressive tenses, present and past), *dáwn (for forming simple future), *dáwn mék (for forming near future), etc. ==AdverbsOccurrence=== Adverbs usually follow the verbs or adjectives they describe. ==Notes and references== :Others: :# Dokhuma, James, Mizo ṭawng kalphung :# Zoppen club, Mizo ṭawng thumal thar, 2011. :# SCERT, Mizo grammar and composition, cl XI & XII textbooks.

He is also an affiliate faculty at the Broad Institute. ==Education== Karp was born and raised in Peterborough, Ontario. He graduated from McGill University in 1999 with a degree in chemical engineering. While at McGill he also co-founded the McGill Engineering Code of Ethics \\"The Blueprint\\". He received a Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering from the University of Toronto in 2004. From 2004 until 2006, Karp was a postdoctoral fellow in Robert Langer's laboratory at MIT in the Harvard–MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology; Karp had applied for the position but Langer had no funds to pay him, so Karp secured funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Langer accepted him. ==Research== In the Langer lab, Karp was inspired by another lab's publication in Nature that described adhesives based on the way that gecko's feet stick to surfaces; he and Langer applied for funding from NSF to make medical adhesives based on geckos, and received the funding. In 2007 he received an appointment and his own lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, at a location near MIT; he retained his association with the Harvard–MIT HST program. He has made mentoring high school students, undergraduates, PhD students, and post docs a priority, and in 2008 he won the Outstanding Undergraduate Student Mentor Award at MIT, and in 2010 he won the Thomas A. McMahon Mentoring Award from the HST program. In 2013 the company Gecko Biomedical was founded based on the gecko adhesive work, as well as subsequent work done in the Karp lab based on secretions of sandcastle worms. In 2014 the company Skintifique was formed to commercialize a barrier cream Karp had invented to prevent skin reactions in people with nickel allergy. In 2015 the company Frequency Therapeutics was founded to create treatments for hearing loss based on work done by Langer and Karp inspired by the ability of some amphibians and birds to regrow hair cells that have been damaged. In 2016 the company Alivio Therapeutics was founded based on work by Langer and Karp on a hydrogel to deliver drugs, intended to stick to tissue and only release the drug in response to inflammation. ==Recognition== Technology Review listed him in 2008 as one of the top innovators under the age of 35 (TR35). Karp received the 2011 Young Investigator award from the Society for Biomaterials, and also in 2011, the Boston Business Journal profiled him as a Champion in Health Care Innovation. ==ReferencesTEDmed talk Category:American bioengineers Category:Stem cell researchers Category:Harvard Medical School faculty Category:McGill University alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:People from Peterborough, Ontario Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jeffrey Karp"},{"id":"35961520","text":"E.T.

Watermeyer CJ, Tindall JA, Greenberg JA, Schreiner JA, and Davis AJA. NE Rosenberg KC (with him D. Gould) appeared for the appellant, and C. Norman Scoble, for the Crown. == Facts == The appellant had been convicted of a contravention of Volksraad Besluit No. 104 of 25 September 1871, in that he had allowed coloured persons, other than those exempted by the Besluit, to occupy an erf in the village of belonging to the appellant, and had been fined £1. This decision was appealed on the grounds # that a breach of the provisions of the Besluit was not a crime; and # that the Besluit, in so far as it referred to coloured persons, had been impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation. == Judgment == The Appellate Division, allowing an appeal, did not think it necessary, for the purposes of this case, to attempt to lay down any specific test for deciding whether an enactment creates a criminal offence. It was sufficient, the court found, to apply the general rule of giving effect to the lawgiver's intention. It considered, therefore, whether or not the language of the Besluit, together with its surrounding circumstances, showed that it was a penal enactment. The court began by comparing the Besliut with other legislative enactments preceding and following it, and found none whose terms showed it to be a criminal enactment but which did not expressly mention a penalty: \\"A survey of the legislation up to and including the period when the Besluit was passed affords good reason for holding that, as a matter of practice, 'when the Volksraad intended to create a crime, it prescribed a penalty.'\\"357. The court held, for this reason and for others, that the Besluit in question did not create a crime. Although it did not make the assumption that, if an enactment is to create a crime, it should provide, either expressly or by reference, for a punishment, \\"I think it improbable that if the lawgiver had intended that the Besluit should create a crime, he would not have taken the precaution of inserting a penalty—more particularly as this is what appears generally to have been done.\\"361. The decision of the Transvaal Provincial Division (where Barry JP and Millin J dismissed an appeal from conviction in the Magistrate's Court of Johannesburg), was thus reversed. == See also == * Crime in South Africa * South African criminal law * South African law == References  Case law === * R v McCulloch 1930 TPD 350. * R v Zinn 1946 AD 346. === Legislation === * Natives (Urban Areas) Act 21 of 1923. == Notes == Category:1946 in South African law Category:1946 in case law Category:Appellate Division (South Africa) cases Category:South African criminal case law ","title":"R v Zinn"},{"id":"35961562","text":"Nest of kittiwake on Gull Island in Alaska The Fraser Darling effect is the simultaneous and shortened breeding season that occurs in large colonies of birds. This synchronized and accelerated breeding leads to a greater chance of survival for each individual offspring. The effect is named after Sir Frank Fraser Darling who proposed it in 1938. While studying herring gulls off the English coast, Fraser Darling noticed that individual gulls rarely raised their young past the fledgling stage. This led him to the conclusion that the birds received sexual stimulation not only from their mates but also from other birds of the same species. In 1956, a study conducted by Colson and White on the mating patterns of kittiwake showed that the effect only extended for two metres and that, for groups of birds who nested more sparsely, a longer breeding time was evident in the population as a whole. However, this particular species nested in areas that were hard for predators to reach and therefore relied less on this phenomenon than other species that were more vulnerable to predation. In 1968, while studying gulls, Horn found that \\"clumped nesting improves foraging efficiency and predation avoidance only when the colony is built in a large expanse of nesting habitat, surrounded by abundant, but patchily distributed food.\\" Since Fraser Darling's initial observation, the phenomenon has also been observed in Brewer's blackbirds, European herring gulls, black-headed gulls, and gannets; however, other studies conducted since have not been able to confirm it in other various species of gulls. ==References== Category:Sociobiology Category:Ornithology Category:Bird breeding Category:Ethology ","title":"Fraser Darling effect"},{"id":"35961575","text":"Bergel may refer to: *Erich Bergel (1930–1998), Romanian musician *Joseph Bergel (1802–1885), Hungarian physician *Erich Bergel (1930–1998), Hungarian Composer *Bergel, Hungarian noble house ","title":"Bergel"},{"id":"35961579","text":"This is a list of Associate Justices of the Rhode Island Supreme Court from 1747 to the present.

The keystone is new, and the original is in the Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem. The building had running water, which was new, and two large meeting rooms for the regents, one for the 4 regents, and one for the 4 regentesses. Once a year they would dine there, and once a year all the orphans of Haarlem would be treated to buns on Pieter Teyler van der Hulst's birthday, as stipulated in his will and testament. Jan Adam Kruseman painted the large group portrait of the regents, featuring a few of the orphans wearing their habitual Mennonite orphan dress (the city orphans had one red sleeve and one blue sleeve, but Mennonite orphans wore brown). In 1939 the building was confiscated for military purposes and the orphanage moved to Baan 25. Under german rule it became a works council, and in 1983 the archives moved here.

He started work as a printer and soon opened his own business at the Bridge End, Gateshead. Much of his business seemed to come from the cheap chapbooks, song slips, many to the hawkers together with last dying confessions; these seem to be the objects which keep turning up in collections. Shortly after closure of The Gateshead Intelligencer, he gave up his printing work and became an auctioneer. On his death, the Gateshead Observer of 26 May 1838 carried a notice which read “On Sunday (May 20), after a long illness, aged 40, much respected, Mr. W. Stephenson, printer\\" == Works == These include :- ===Publishing and/or printing=== In 1824 he published a small chapbook “The Tyneside Minstrel” which contained the works of William Mitford, William Oliver, his father William Stephenson (senior), himself and others. His own works in this book include “Beggar’s Wedding\\" which is signed “S” and more than 10 pieces signed “X” including The Lass that shed a tear for me” and “Ellen”. In 1834 he published his father's collection of poems and songs In 1830 he introduced a new periodical, \\"The Gateshead Intelligencer\\", a sixpenny monthly which was half newspaper and half magazine. It ran from 1830 to 1833 ===Poetry and songwriting=== The Beggar's Wedding Ellen The Lass that shed a tear for me Merry Lads of Gyetshead The Sandhill Monkey Smiling Betty == See also == Geordie dialect words Thomas Allan Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings P.

PENTATONE’s reputation for excellence is supported by a diverse catalogue, from the familiar to the unusual or unexpected, driven by the ambition to innovate classical music. PENTATONE works both with internationally renowned artists and rising stars, believing into genuine artistic expression as its driving force. ==History== Three former executives of Philips Classics, Giel Bessels, Dirk van Dijk and Job Maarse, established the label in 2001. The name comes from the words penta (five) and tone (sound), meaning five channels of sound. The label is renowned for its high-resolution multichannel surround sound recordings which are released in the Super Audio CD format.In January 2002, Pentatone recorded the official music which was performed during the wedding ceremony of the Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander and Máxima Zorreguieta. The album, “The Music from the Royal Wedding”, sold more than 75,000 copies, thereby attaining the unique “triple platinum” status. The label has also licensed recordings made by other labels such as Philips Classics and Deutsche Grammophon. Among these are recordings from the 1970s which were originally recorded for 4-channel quadraphonic sound. Pentatone has remastered them for re-release and presented them in surround sound for the first time. All PENTATONE's hybrid Super Audio CD discs can also be heard in 2-channel stereo on conventional Compact Disc players. In 2013, a new management team has joined PENTATONE and the label expanded to multiple formats releases, including regular cd, vinyl, and all formats for streaming and downloads. The first vinyl was released in 2017 as a luxury 3LP edition. The label decided to honour Julia Fischer's Bach violin solo recordings (originally released by the label in 2005), often reviewed as the best Bach performance on violin to date. == Awards == Pentatone’s Managing Director, Simon Eder, collects the Gramophone's 2019 Label of the Year Award In 2004, the label received a Grammy Award for their recording of Peter and the Wolf, narrated by Sophia Loren, Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev, where the story is told from the perspective of the wolf and has the theme of letting animals live in peace. Other award-winning issues have included John Corigliano's The Ghosts of Versailles, part of the American Opera Series, which won multiple awards for the 59th Grammy Award as Best Opera Recording and Best Engineered Album. In 2019 Pentatone's premiere recording of the Mason Bates opera “The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs” won The Best Opera Recording at the 61st Grammy Awards Ceremony. Among the winners were composer Mason Bates, librettist Mark Campbell, the Santa Fe Opera, conductor Michael Christie, and the cast, which included Sasha Cooke, Jessica E. Jones, Edward Parks, Garrett Sorenson, Wei Wu, and Elizabeth Ostrow. The opera was nominated for Best Contemporary Composition but lost to the Kernis Violin Concerto. In 2019, the label has been awarded Label of the Year by the Gramophone Magazine. In 2020, PENTATONE won the title of Label of the Year by the ICMA (International Classical Music Awards). == Affiliated artists  Piano === * Pierre-Laurent Aimard * Mari Kodama * Martin Helmchen * Denis Kozhukhin * Francesco Piemontesi * Nareh Arghamanyan * Momo Kodama * Tamara Stefanovich * Sa Chen * Yevgeny Sudbin * Anne-Marie McDermott * David Fung * Jeffrey Kahane === Violin === *Arabella Steinbacher *Deborah Nemtanu *Jonathan Crow *Julia Fischer *Sarah Nemtanu *Guy Braunstein === Cello === * Johannes Moser * Matt Haimovitz * Alisa Weilerstein === Mezzo- soprano === * Alice Coote * Ann Hallenberg * Magdalena Kozena * Jamie Barton * Dame Sarah Connolly === Soprano === * Hanna-Elisabeth Müller * Anna Lucia Richter * Esther Dierkes * Francesca Aspromonte * Julie Fuchs * Lisa Delan * Miah Persson * Nicole Heaston === Tenor === * Piotr Beczala * Michael Fabiano * Toby Spence * Christian Elsner * Cyrille Dubois * Robin Tritschler * Robert Dean Smith === Countertenor === * Bejun Mehta === Baritone === * Thomas Hampson * Florian Sempey === Guitar === * Sean Shibe === Flute === * Ana de la Vega * Jessica Sindell === Percussion === * Doug Perkins === Bass === * Luc Bertin-Hugault * Peter Rose === Ensembles === * Akademie fur Alte Musik Berlin * Calder Quartet * Calefax * Signum Quartett * Holland Baroque * La Cetra * Il pomo d'oro * Mirò Quartet * Emerson String Quartet === Choir === * Les Cris de Paris * NDR Chor * South Dakota Chorale === Conductors === * Alexandre Bloch * Andres Orozco-Estrada * Andrew Manze * Enrico Onofri * Marc Albrecht * Marek Janowski * Vladimir Jurowski * Jakub Hrusa * Kazuki Yamada * Gustavo Gimeno * Lawrence Foster * Kent Nagano * Carlo Ponti * Simon Murphy * Mikhail Pletnev * Sir Neville Marriner * Yakov Kreizberg * Philippe Herreweghe * Rafael Kubelik * René Jacobs * Herbert Blomstedt * Christopher Rountree * Marc Minkowski === Orchestras === * English Chamber Orchestra * Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin * Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra * Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest * Russian National Orchestra * NDR Radiophilharmonie * WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne * WDR Rundfunkchor Köln * hr-Sinfonieorchester * Houston Symphony * Oregon Symphony * Orchestre de la Suisse Romande * Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille * Orchestre National de Lille * State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Russia Evgeny Svetlanov” *The Santa Fe Opera * New Dutch Academy * B'Rock Orchestra * Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra * Les Musiciens du Louvre === Composers === * Gordon Getty * Jake Heggie * Jennifer Higdon * John Corigliano * Hilarion Alfeyev * Luna Pearl Woolf *Mason Bates *Missy Mazzoli == Catalogue series == * Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg series * AMERICAN OPERAS Series * Dances Series * REMASTERED CLASSICS Philips Classics * PENTATONE Oxingale Series * REMASTERED CLASSICS Deutsche Grammophon * RQR Series == References  External links == * Official website of Pentatone Category:Classical music record labels Category:Dutch record labels Category:Record labels established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"Pentatone (record label)"},{"id":"35961769","text":"The 1981-82 NBA season was the Bulls' 16th season in the NBA.1981-82 Chicago Bulls ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" !

A particular nation's rating score is independent of the performance of other nation. But in the comparative rating index of sovereigns (CRIS) introduced by India,http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/finmin-unveils-comparative- sovereign-ratings-index/156691/on performance of one nation is compared with all other nations. Perhaps it was the first sovereign rating index by any country in the world. This solves the limitations of the existing credit rating system. An example of comparative rating is the percentile score—the way GATE results are at times given. If a student is described as belonging to the 99th percentile, it clearly says something about this student’s performance vis-à-vis other students. ==Limitations of existing system== A nation might have travelled down the rating ladder in absolute terms. But it may be, in relative terms, better off because others have done even worse. This relative performance cannot be measured in the present system. == Advantages of CRIS == When an investor searches across nations for a place to put her money, the relative rating of nations is important. If nation x’s rating remaining the same, other nations’ ratings improve over time, there may well be a case to invest less in nation x.Economic survey of India http://indiabudget.nic.in/survey.asp ==How it is calculated== The Ministry of Finance, India calculated this new index and ranks 101 economies for the years 2007 to 2011. The computation of CRIS is based on Moody's ratings and data on the GDPs (not adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)) of different nations as given by the IMF. It is a pure mathematical and statistical methods without interventions or interpretations.Ministry of Finance working paper http://finmin.nic.in/WorkingPaper/CRIS_report_SCR28032012.pdf The full paper is, as of July 2015, classified. == CRIS scores == The CRIS scores for India were 66.47 (2007) and 69.83 (2011). In other words, in relative terms India has become a better investment destination by 5.06%. In addition, India’s rank in terms of CRIS has moved up from 61st to 55th.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-basus-new-index-india-a-better- investment-option/906288/0 If we view the rankings in terms of quintiles (blocks of one-fifth of the distribution) India moves from the fourth quintile to the third, that is, the middle quintile. As expected the CRIS score for Greece has dropped sharply from 74.24 in 2007 to 13.97 in 2011—a decline of 81%; and that of Ireland and Portugal have dropped by more than 14%. In terms of CRIS, the U.S. has seen its score rise from 78.20 to 81.81. This is accompanied by a loss of rank from the top of the chart to the 16th position. This shows that CRIS is distinct from a percentile score which is also a relative measure of status. In 2007 the 1st rank was shared between 20 economies but by 2011 this cohort had shrunk to 15. The improvement in CRIS scores of nations such as India, China and Indonesia are partly due to the dramatic falls of scores of some European nations leading to a deterioration of the world average by over 4.8%. All the BRICS had improvements in rank as well as index value. The ten highest increases in the CRIS from 2007 to 2011 were achieved by (1) Paraguay (31.26%), (2) Lebanon (22.71%), (3) Bolivia (21.2%), (4) Uruguay (18.09%), (5) Belize and Nicaragua (both 15.63%), (7) Philippines (14.26%), (8) Indonesia (12.83%), (9) Peru (12.75%) and (10) Ecuador (12.27%). In interpreting these results, it needs to be borne in mind that for countries which began with low CRIS values, the scope for improvement is more. Seventeen economies had negative growth in the CRIS across this period. The ten highest decreases were (1) Greece (−81.19%), (2) Portugal (−14.82%), (3) Ireland (−14.14%), (4) Iceland (−11.52%), (5) Belarus (−10.05%), (6) Jamaica (−7.45%), (7) Egypt (−7.16%), (8) Cyprus (−5.94%), (9) Pakistan (−5.83%) and (10) Hungary (−4.66%). ==References == Category:Rating systems ","title":"Comparative rating index of sovereigns"},{"id":"35961793","text":"Anthony Fernandes (born 6 July 1936 in Mangalore, Karnataka, India) is the first Bishop of the Diocese of Bareilly, within the Catholic Church in India.

He spent a large part of his career in Paris and Rome. ==Biography== José Álvarez de Pereira y Cubero was born at Priego de Córdoba on 23 April 1768, the son of a stonemason. He spent all his spare time drawing and modelling. He was taught by the French sculptor Miguel Verdiguier at Cordova, and at the Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. In 1799 Charles IV awarded him a pension of 12,000 reals to visit Paris and Rome. In 1804 he executed a statue of Ganymede while in Paris, now in the Museo del Prado, which gained him immediate recognition as a leading sculptor. His pension was doubled and he left for Rome, where he stayed until within a year of his death. While in Paris Álvarez married Elizabeth Bougel, by whom he had a son in 1805. This son, Don Jose Alvarez y Bougel, also distinguished himself as a sculptor and a painter but died at Burgos before reaching the age of twenty- five. His refusal to recognize Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain led to his imprisonment in Rome.Parry, Melanie (1997) Chambers Biographical Dictionary - Centenary Edition', Chambers, , p. 49 After his release he was employed by Napoleon I to decorate the Quirinal Palace. In 1816 he was appointed court sculptor to Ferdinand VII. One of the most successful works of the elder Álvarez was a group representing Antilochus and Memnon, which was commissioned in marble (1818) by Ferdinand VII. It is now in the museum of Madrid. He also modelled a few portrait busts (Ferdinand VII., Rossini, the duchess of Alba), which are remarkable for their vigour and fidelity. After his return to Madrid, he taught at the Academy of San Fernando, where one of his pupils was the young Ponciano Ponzano (1813–1877), later to become one of the most famous of Spanish neoclassical sculptors of his day. Álvarez died in Madrid on 26 November 1827. ==Gallery== File:Ganímedes (José Álvarez Cubero) MRABASF 01.jpgGanymede, 1804 File:Isabel de Braganza (J.

In November 2012 she signed for Liverpool Ladies of the FA WSL, after beginning her career with home town club Leeds United then spending two seasons with Chelsea in 2011 and 2012. She captained Liverpool to the 2013 FA WSL title and made her debut for the senior England women's national football team in September 2013. At UEFA Women's Euro 2013 Bonner was part of England's squad but did not play. ==Club careerEarly career=== Bonner started playing football as soon as she could run and by the age of eight had already joined Leeds United. ===Leeds United=== While at Leeds, the defender won the League Cup in 2010, and was in the runner-up team of the FA Cup in 2008. ===Chelsea=== Her versatility with both feet and strong aerial ability were the main attributes that brought Chelsea calling in January 2011, when the Blues secured her signature ahead of the Women's Super League. She played in the first ever FA Cup Final of Chelsea, in 2012. The young defender scored her only goal of the 2011–12 FA Women's Cup in their 2–0 away win against The Belles in the 6th round, helping her side to secure their place in the semi finals. In the penalty shoot-out of the 2012 FA Women's Cup Final, she was unable to convert her penalty into a goal. She blazed hers over the bar to hand the Cup to Birmingham. Bonner scored her first league goal for Chelsea in the very next game after the 2012 FA Women's Cup Final, against their cup final opponents Birmingham. ===Liverpool=== In November 2012 Bonner signed for Liverpool. In doing so she linked up with her ex-Chelsea manager Matt Beard and expressed her excitement at the move: \\"I am delighted to be joining Liverpool at a key time in my football career and have been greatly influenced by the commitment that Liverpool FC are showing towards women's football. When the opportunity to work with Matt again came I was pleased to take it and I am excited for the challenge ahead.\\" With Bonner as captain Liverpool won the league title in 2013 and 2014 but were much less successful in 2015, finishing second bottom. She extended her contract with the club in November 2015. ===Manchester City=== Bonner left Liverpool in June 2018 after six years and a total of 115 appearances, to join Manchester City Women. ==International career== An England representative at Under 17s, Under 19s, Under 20s and Under 23s level by the age of 19, Bonner has accumulated a wealth of international experience. She was in the England Under 17s World Cup team, in which they ended in the fourth place. In 2009 Bonner was part of the England Under 19s European Championship winning side. Bonner received her first senior team call-up for the UEFA Euro 2013 qualifier away to Croatia in March 2012. Bonner made her first senior appearance in September 2013, under interim coach Brent Hills, in an 8–0 World Cup qualifying win over Turkey at Fratton Park. She was recalled to the team by incoming coach Phil Neville in January 2018, but an ankle ligament injury ruled her out of the 2018 SheBelieves Cup in March. In February 2019 Bonner was added to the England squad for the SheBelieves Cup following an injury to Millie Bright. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list England's goal tally first. {  !

Written by Oliver Drake and Joseph F. Poland, the film is about two Texas Rangers traveling undercover as western troubadours in search of the killer of an old, half-blind man. ==Plot== Texas Rangers Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) are traveling undercover as western troubadours in search of the killer of old, half-blind Frank Martin. Their only clues are a guitar string (the murder weapon) and Martin's horse Swayback that hold the key to finding the dead man's lost goldmine. Following Frank Martin's funeral, Martin's granddaughter, Joan (Barbara Pepper), meets her uncle, John Martin, and Lon Dillon, who flirts with her. Lawyer Henry Nolan reads Martin's will, revealing that the deceased left John $5,000 and the remainder of the estate to Joan. John tells Joan that he suspects Gene of her grandfather's murder and persuades her to hold a masquerade dance to lure Gene into town. Meanwhile, Gene learns that Martin was nearly blind and relied on his horse Swayback to guide him. By following Swayback, whom Lon, John, and Henry have all tried to buy, Gene discovers that Martin had indeed located a gold mine. Gene and Frog escape a trap set for them at the dance and save Joan when she is nearly strangled by another guitar string. Then Gene discovers that John's guitar is missing a string. John and Pablo, who have uncovered Swayback's hiding place, find the mine and are followed by Henry, Lon, and Hank Polk. As they argue among themselves, Gene surprises them and reveals that he is a Texas Ranger assigned to the Martin murder case. By claiming that Frog is a fingerprint expert, Gene tricks Henry into admitting his guilt. Henry is then arrested by the sheriff, who is waiting in the mine according to Gene's instructions. Finally, Joan learns that Gene has recorded the deed to the mine in her name. ==Cast== * Gene Autry as Gene Autry * Barbara Pepper as Joan Martin * Smiley Burnette as Frog Millhouse * Fred Kelsey as Hank Polk * J.

Greenblatt tells the story of how Poggio Bracciolini, a 15th-century papal emissary and obsessive book hunter, saved the last copy of the Roman poet Lucretius's De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things) from near-terminal neglect in a German monastery, thus reintroducing important ideas that sparked the modern age. The title and the subtitle of the book are explained in the author's preface. \\"The Swerve\\" refers to a key conception in the ancient atomistic theories according to which atoms moving through the void are subject to clinamen: while falling straight through the void, they are sometimes subject to a slight, unpredictable swerve. Greenblatt uses it to describe the history of Lucretius' own book: \\"The reappearance of his poem was such a swerve, an unforeseen deviation from the direct trajectory—in this case, toward oblivion—on which that poem and its philosophy seemed to be traveling.\\"Stephen Greenblatt, The Swerve: How the World Became Modern W. W. Norton & Company, p.14 ff. The recovery of the ancient text is seen as its rebirth, i.e. a \\"renaissance\\". Greenblatt's claim is that it was a 'key moment' in a larger \\"story ... of how the world swerved in a new direction\\". ==Reception== The book attracted considerable critical attention, some positive and some negative. In addition to winning both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award, it also won the Modern Language Association James Russell Lowell Prize.Modern Language Association James Russell Lowell Prize Publishers Weekly called it a \\"gloriously learned page-turner\\", and Newsweek called it \\"mesmerizing\\" and \\"richly entertaining\\". Maureen Corrigan, in her review for NPR, praised the work as brilliant and brimming with ideas and stories. It was included in the 2011 year-end lists of Publishers Weekly,Year-end Lists - 2011 Books The New York Times, Kirkus Reviews,Eric Liebetrau, Kirkus Reviews Best Non-Fiction of 2011, NPR,Maureen Corrigan, NPR Year-End Wrap-Up: The 10 Best Novels Of 2011, The Chicago Tribune,The Chicago Tribune's favorite books of 2011, Bloomberg,Laurie Muchnick, King’s New Kennedy, Greenblatt Finds ’Swerve’ in Top 2011 Books, SFGate,SFGate,Best books of 2011: 100 recommended books, the American Library Association,American Library Association, 2012 Notable Books List: best in adult fiction, non-fiction and poetry, and The Globe and Mail.The Globe and Mail, The Globe's top 100 books of 2011 Writing in The New Republic, David Quint saw the book as situated in a controversial tradition that views the Renaissance as a victory of reason over medieval religiosity, following John Addington Symonds, Voltaire and David Hume.David Quint, The New Republic, Humanism As Revolution Theologian R. R. Reno harshly criticized the book for \\"blustering again and again about the beauty-loathing, eros-denying evils of Christianity ... sighing in the usual postmodern way about pleasure and desire.\\" Historian John Monfasani credited the book with \\"grace and learning\\" but found Greenblatt's Voltairean and Burckhardtian interpretation of De Rerum Natura and the Renaissance \\"eccentric\\", \\"questionable\\" and \\"unwarranted\\". Greenblatt responded to this critique by reiterating his view of the importance of the Renaissance in history. Several other reviewers criticized Greenblatt's lack of historical rigor and depth while acknowledging some praiseworthy elements. In the Los Angeles Review of Books Jim Hinch saw within the book \\"two books... one deserving of an award, the other not\\". He described the first \\"book\\" as an \\"engaging\\" and \\"wonderful\\" exploration of the Renaissance rediscovery of De Rerum Natura, while describing the second book as a far less deserving \\"anti-religious polemic.\\"Jim Hinch, The Los Angeles Review of Books, \\"Why Stephen Greenblatt is wrong and why it matters\\" Michael Dirda, of The Washington Post, wrote that \\"by no means a bad book, The Swerve simply sets its intellectual bar too low, complacently relying on commonplaces in its historical sections and never engaging in an imaginative or idiosyncratic way\\". Disappointed with the book's simplistic and clichéd conclusions, he nonetheless saw Greenblatt's \\"excellent notes and bibliography\\" as a reliable reference for those seeking a more in-depth and serious treatment.https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/stephen- greenblatts-the-swerve-reviewed-by-michael- dirda/2011/09/20/gIQA8WmVmK_story.html Stephen Greenblatt’s “The Swerve,” reviewed by Michael Dirda Laura Saetveit Miles, of the University of Bergen, criticized the book in explicitly ethical terms, writing that its scholarly and historiographical failings \\"represent an abuse of power\\" that \\"precipitate the decline of the humanities\\" by lending scholarly authority to the \\"dire trend of 'truthy' nonfiction books that present One Theory to Explain Everything.\\" She argues that the book is an \\"injustice to the past\\" and \\"the mythical invention of modernity is an ethical issue, because it sets a precedent for history that ignores complexity in favor of oversimplification.\\" William Caferro of Vanderbilt University found The Swerve \\"an engaging portrait of the Renaissance sense of wonder and discovery\\" but was disquieted by the \\"firm distinction Greenblatt makes between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages\\" and the lack of reference to current scholarship.William Caferro, \\"Review of The Swerve: How the Renaissance Began\\", Modern Philology (2013), v.111, online Nevertheless, he concedes that \\"if Greenblatt leaves us with more questions than answers, it is ultimately not a grave flaw.\\" ==References *Pulitzer page *W.

On January 6, 1922, Jones defeated well known black boxer Speedball Hayden in a ninth round knockout at Fort Bliss Arena in El Paso, Texas. Jones was favored in the early publicity for his powerful, aggressive infighting, and heavy hitting. Hayden had defeated Jones earlier on April 1, 1921 in Phoenix, Arizona in an eight round points decision. Jones was said to have put up a great effort but Hayden was clearly his master, deserving the decision. On November 25, 1920, Jones lost a fourth round disqualification in Columbus, Ohio, but was reported by the El Paso Times to have knocked Hayden to the mat four times prior to the foul.Bran, Sargent Jim, El Passo Times, El Paso, Texas, pg. 10, 1 January 1922 ===Taking the world colored welterweight championship, February, 1915=== Tiger Flowers Because of the color bar in pro boxing, Jones never competed for the world title which was not open to black boxers during his career. He won the World Colored Welterweight Championship from Eddie Palmer, the inaugural champion, in a twenty round points decision in New Orleans on February 15, 1915, though he apparently never defended it. On February 21, 1922, he met future world middleweight champ Tiger Flowers, the first black boxer to win the world welterweight title, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico for the Southwest Middleweight Championship. He lost in a fourth round knockout of a scheduled 15-round bout. A few sources report that Jones lost via a ninth round T.K.O. Jones had a career record of 18 wins and 17 losses. He was knocked out ten times and had two draws. ==References== Category:African-American boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:World colored welterweight boxing champions Category:American male boxers Category:Boxers from Louisiana Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Gorilla Jones (&quot;The Fighting Gorilla&quot;)"},{"id":"35962071","text":"Elton Ibragimov (рус.

Once used to refer to all forms of mourning for one's parents, it evolved in meaning to refer only to the practice of officials resigning their posts for mourning. The roots of the practice lie in the Confucianist focus on filial piety as a key virtue of government, and thus was instituted during the Western Han dynasty, when Confucianism first became the official ideology of the empire. During the mourning period, banqueting, marriage, official activities and participation in the Imperial Examinations are all proscribed. The length of the mourning period is nominally three years, though in practice it has been described as being between twenty-five to twenty-seven months; this is also in line with Confucian prescriptions, since it takes three years for a human child to be fully weaned. At the end of the period, officials will be returned to the same rank as their last previously served post. Nonetheless, given the length of the mandatory mourning and the tight restrictions on political or public activity, this practice often had a negative effect on the career of officials. Measures did exist to allow the government to recall an official in mourning; this is often applied to key officials in the bureaucracy, who are unable to leave their duties immediately as prescribed, or in times of emergency. On the other hand, failure to report a deceased parent and submit to filial mourning was an offence, and officials were liable to be impeached upon discovery. Even the Emperor was subjected to filial mourning, though his indispensability to administrative duties means he need only mourn for 27 days, instead of months.

The biological son of Odessa and adopted son of Ginny, he is plagued by hallucinations from his violent past. * Yazmin Ortiz: Elliot’s twenty-nine- year-old cousin, niece to Odessa and adjunct professor at Swarthmore College. * Odessa Ortiz: Elliot’s birth mother, thirty-nine, who goes by the alias Haikumom on her Narcotics Anonymous site.

Also plays a Japanese policeman and Yazmin’s colleague at Swarthmore College, Arabic Studies Professor Aman. ==Concept== It is the second part of a trilogy that began with Elliot, A Soldier's Fugue and concludes with The Happiest Song Plays Last. The first part of the trilogy is \\"about a young Marine, Elliot Ortiz, coming to terms with his time in Iraq and his father’s and grandfather’s service in Vietnam and Korea\\". Water by the Spoonful takes place several years after, Elliot, a veteran, has returned to his home in Philadelphia after being wounded while serving in Iraq. The play depicts the aftermath of the death of Ginny, Elliot’s adoptive mother. As Elliot and his cousin Yaz attempt to process their loss, Ginny’s sister Odessa, Elliot’s biological mother, bonds with other recovering addicts on the Narcotics Anonymous support chat room she moderates. ==Plot== A sequel to Hudes’ previous play Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue, Water by the Spoonful picks up seven years after the events of its predecessor. War-wounded Elliot Ortiz has returned to his home town of Philadelphia, where, between coping through recurring bouts of posttraumatic stress disorder and interactions with a mysterious Arabic-speaking ghost, he now works at a local Subway sandwich shop. Whilst his “mother” Ginny nears death, Elliot’s cousin Yazmin, a Swarthmore College music professor undergoing a divorce, urges him to work with a documentary filmmaker who wants his help making a movie about the Iraq War. Meanwhile, Elliot’s birth mother, and Ginny’s sister, Odessa, a recovered heroin addict, runs and moderates an anonymous online message board for recovering addicts like Orangutan and Chutes & Ladders under the alias Haikumom. The safeness of the space is compromised when a wealthy fellow Philadelphia native and addict-in-denial Fountainhead sows discord in the chat; Odessa wants to welcome him, but Orangutan and Chutes & Ladders doubt his intentions. Ginny passes away, leaving Yazmin and Elliot with limited funds to organize her funeral and eulogize her. They confront Odessa, who is meeting with Fountainhead at a café, for her failure to financially contribute, and Elliot explodes at her, revealing to Fountainhead that his flu-stricken younger sister died from dehydration after a using Odessa neglected to give her water by the spoonful. Shamed, Odessa gives Elliot permission to sell her computer for funeral money, which he does, but not before posing as her on the message board and insulting Orangutan and Chutes & Ladders. Odessa relapses, leaving Fountainhead to nurture her as Orangutan and Chutes & Ladders finally meet in Japan. Yazmin and Elliot scatter Ginny’s ashes in Puerto Rico, and Elliot vows to leave Philadelphia. ==Critical response== Pulitzer.org describes the play as \\"...an imaginative play about the search for meaning by a returning Iraq War veteran working in a sandwich shop in his hometown of Philadelphia.\\" The Boston Globe describes it as a story of \\"...an Iraq war veteran struggling to find his place in the world...\\" David Ng of The Los Angeles Times says the play \\"follows an Iraq war veteran who is struggling with civilian life.

It is considered a significant institution in the rise of the social sciences, though there had been earlier societies in the area in the first decades of the 19th century. It was formally dissolved in 1862, long after it had ceased to be active. The effective manifesto of the Société was Des charactères physiologiques des races humaines considérés dans leurs rapports avec l'histoire, a pamphlet of Edwards from a decade earlier. The group brought together by Edwards included linguists and geographers. The aim was to study human variability, and draw racially based conclusions. Edwards was the first President, with Imbert des Mottelettes as Secretary, but he died in 1842 and was replaced by the vicomte de Santarém. The Société was active for some years towards the end of the July Monarchy, but then political involvements told against it. Publications appeared to 1847. The membership of the Société included significant Saint- Simonian figures, among them Gustave d'Eichthal and Ismael Urbain. ==Notes== Category:Scientific societies based in France Category:Ethnology Category:1839 establishments in France Category:1862 disestablishments ","title":"Société Ethnologique de Paris"},{"id":"35962185","text":"Land of the Yankee Fork State Park is a history-oriented public recreation area covering in Custer County, Idaho, United States.

Born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1892, the 5'9\\" Palmer fought at a weight of between 142 and 156 lbs. out of Philadelphia and New Orleans between 1910 and 1925. He moved to Philadelphia in August 1911 and fought out of the City of Brotherly Love for two years. While based in Philadelphia, he twice fought future world light- heavyweight champ Battling Levinsky in 1912, scoring no decisions in both fights. In the later part of his career, he fought future world middleweight champ Tiger Flowers in 1922, losing both fights. Palmer declared himself the World Colored Welterweight Champion in 1912 after fighting Young Tommy Coleman to a no-decision in a six-round bout in New York City on 26 September 1912. They had met four times since 3 October 1911, when Coleman won a newspaper decision in a six round bout in Philadelphia. Palmer had won their second match while their third match was reported variously as a draw and a newspaper decision for Coleman. When they met for a rematch four days later on September 30 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader gave the decision to Coleman. Later that year, in an exhibition held on December 9, he killed Kid Harris in the ring. He only fought twice in 1913, but fought 11 times in 1914. He successfully defended his colored welterweight title on 4 March 1914 against Kyle Whitney in New Orleans, winning on points in a 20-rounder. His next defense was on 15 February 1915 in New Orleans against \\"The Fighting Gorilla, who out-pointed him in their 20 round contest. In his next fight, on 1 May 1915, Palmer won the World Colored Middleweight Championship by K.O.ing Willie Langford in the 14th round of a scheduled 20-round bout in New Orleans. Palmer successfully defended his Colored Middleweight Title twice against Young Kid McCoy, once in 1915 and once in 1916, winning both fights by knock out. He continued to fight regularly until 1922, when he lost two fights to Tiger Flowers. He made a comeback in 1925, but lost both of his fights. Another comeback attempt in 1928, in which he fought USA Arizona State light- heavyweight title holder Owen Phelps in Comiskey Park, ended in a loss. In 1929, he fought in New Orleans, winning the first three of his four fights that year against lightly regarded opponents. He retired after losing his last fight to a welterweight with a career record of 45 wins (21 by K.O.) against 23 losses (K.O.ed five times) and two draws. He had 24 newspaper decisions, winning 14, losing five and drawing five. ==References== Category:African- American boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:Middleweight boxers Category:World colored welterweight boxing champions Category:World colored middleweight boxing champions Category:American male boxers Category:Place of birth missing ","title":"Eddie Palmer (boxer)"},{"id":"35962232","text":"John Nugent, 5th Earl of Westmeath (1671 – 3 July 1754) was an Irish nobleman and professional soldier.

Mutations in CPOX usually cause hereditary coproporphyria, an acute hepatic porphyria, however the K404E mutation in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state with a null allele cause the more severe harderoporphyria. Harderoporphyria is the first known metabolic disorder where the disease phenotype depended on the type and location of the mutations in a gene associated with multiple disorders. In contrast with other porphyrias, which typically present with either cutaneous lesions after exposure to sunlight or acute neurovisceral attack at any age (most commonly in adulthood), harderoporphyria is characterized by jaundice, anemia enlarged liver and spleen, often presenting in the neonatal period. Later in life, these individuals may present with photosensitivity similar to that found in cutaneous porphyrias. Biochemically, harderoporphyria presents with a distinct pattern of increased harderoporphyrin (2-vinyl-4,6,7-tripropionic acid porphyrin) in urine and particularly in feces, a metabolite that is not seen in significant quantities in any other porphyria. Enzyme tests show markedly reduced activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase, compared to both unaffected individuals and those affected with hereditary coproporphyria, consistent with recessive inheritance. Harderoporphyria is a rare condition, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide. It may be underdiagnosed, as it does not have the typical presentation associated with a porphyria. It was identified as a variant type of coproporphyria in 1983, in a family with three children identified at birth with jaundice and hemolytic anemia. There is no standard treatment for harderoporphyria; care is mainly focused on the management of symptoms. ==References External links == Category:Porphyrias Category:Heme metabolism disorders ","title":"Harderoporphyria"},{"id":"35962288","text":"Ian F. Thomas (born 1976) is an American installation artist formally trained in ceramics. He currently lives and works in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. ==Early life and education== Ian F. Thomas was raised in Western Pennsylvania where he spent much of his time on a family farm. It is here where Thomas first became interested in objects and the notion of art as a form of play. The coupling of this rural setting with a sense of childhood imagination has become a foundation for much of Thomas' artistic investigations to this day. In 1999, Thomas received his bachelor's degree from Slippery Rock University. During this time, he also studied at The Academy of Fine Art and Design in Bratislava, Slovakia. After graduating, He became a studio assistant to ceramic artist Edward Eberle. Thomas has also worked with James Watkins, Von Venhuizen, and Juan Granados at Texas Tech University where he received his MFA in 2006. ==Career== Since 2007, Thomas has been an active ceramic arts demonstrator across the country. He has lectured and given demonstrations at Cornell University, East Carolina University, and The Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute, among others. He has also been an active force in experimental collaboration within the fine art world. In 2009, Thomas founded the Culture Laboratory Collective, a group of twelve artists from across the country who all work with ideas of social cohesion without conforming their own personal aesthetics. The Culture Laboratory Collective has worked with contemporary art critics such as Ben Lewis and Noah Simblist. It has conducted exhibitions at locations such as The Nave Museum, in Victoria, Texas as well as in Jingdezhen, Beijing, and Shanghai, China. Thomas has exhibited work internationally and appeared in numerous publications.

She received the Mark Twain Award from the Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature in 2012. Seaton taught creative writing and African-American literature at Central Michigan University for 15 years as a professor of English. ==Personal life== Seaton was born in Columbia, Tennessee, to Albert Sampson Browne, Jr. and Hattye Evans, both teachers. After Seaton's parents divorced, her mother remarried and the family moved to Chicago's West Side in 1949. Seaton's grandmother, Emma Louish Evans, often performed at amateur minstrel shows and had a strong influence on her granddaughter's work. Evans gave Seaton a deep pride in the work of Flournoy Miller, a family member, who wrote the book for the pioneering all black musical Shuffle Along in 1921. Seaton graduated from Farragut High School in Chicago and received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in Arts and Letters (Creative Writing). At Illinois, she studied with John Frederick Nims, George Scouffas, and Webster Smalley. She earned a Master of Arts degree in creative writing from Michigan State University. Seaton is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She married James Seaton, a professor of English at Michigan State University; the couple has four children. == Career == Seaton is the author of 10 plays, the libretto for a solo opera, a spoken-word piece, and short fiction.

The fictional work is a depiction of the innermost thoughts of Sarah \\"Sally\\" Hemings, an enslaved woman of mixed race who is believed to have had a sexual relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Bolcom asked Seaton to create \\"diary\\" entries that would provide the text for his song cycle From The Diary of Sally Hemings. Seaton spent more than a year doing research to create a \\"diary\\" that would be historically plausible. As David Lewman pointed out in an article on Seaton's libretto, \\"It was a challenge. Though there is voluminous material on Jefferson and his period, there are no surviving examples of writing by Sally Hemings.\\"LAS News, 2003. Retrieved March 5, 2013.

Seaton has continued to explore the relationship between Sally Hemings and the third president in two plays, Sally, a solo play, and A Bed Made in Heaven, a multi-character play. Sally premiered in 2003 at the New York State Writers Institute featuring Zabryna Guevara. Seaton's play The Will, the story of an African-American family in Tennessee during Reconstruction, was performed in Idlewild, Michigan, the historic black resort, in 2008 as part of an event that focused on the connections between African-American culture and classical music. The character of Patti was inspired by the life of Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, the African-American opera singer of the Civil War era. Seaton's comedy Martha Stewart Slept Here, set in an Indiana trailer park, premiered in 2008 and Estate Sale, a comedy set in a Cleveland suburb, in 2011. Music History, a play about African-American college students at the University of Illinois, SNCC, and the struggle for civil rights, was the focus of a 2010 symposium at Michigan State University on the ability of drama to illuminate issues of racial and social justice.

Gottfred Eickhoff (11 April 1902 in Frederiksberg – 26 July 1982) was a Danish sculptor. Inspired by French trends, his work contrasted with that of his predecessors, exhibiting a spirit of harmony, peace and balance. ==Early life== After matriculating from high school in 1920, Eickhoff embarked on law studies but changed paths in 1926 when he became a pupil of Harald Giersing. Realizing he would now concentrate on sculpture, he continued his studies in Paris from 1927 to 1933 under Charles Despiau, associating with a wide range of sculptors including Jean Osouf and Paul Cornet from France, Charles Leplae from Belgium, Han Wezelaar from the Netherlands, Bror Hjorth from Sweden and Adam Fischer and Astrid Noack from Denmark.\\"Gottfred Eickhoff\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 28 May 2012. ==Career== In 1933, he exhibited with the Grønningen artists, becoming a member of the association in 1935. His works immediately attracted considerable interest: his busts Kvindehoved. Merete Bodelsen (limestone, 1931) and Gerda (clay, 1932) were acquired by Statens Museum for Kunst and the Carlsberg Foundation. He received a stipendium from the foundation allowing him to make an extended tour of Italy, Greece, Egypt and Turkey in 1936. His works from this period follow the French trends of Aristide Maillol and Charles Despiau, contrasting with Danish designs. Works from this period include Marseillepiger (limestone, 1935), Corfupige (bronze, 1939) and Roepiger (bronze, 1939) which now stands on the market place in Sakskøbing. His bronze female figure Guapa can be seen outside the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. After the war, he travelled to Italy, Spain and Morocco before becoming a professor at the Danish Academy in 1954. He frequently sketched during his travels, producing such prized works as a drawing of a cow deprived of its calf in San Cataldo (1952) and of a shop in Zauen, Morocco (1953). His drawings demonstrate his skills at light and shade, reminiscent of Goya and Rembrandt. Later in life, he used his drawings as a basis for sculpted works. ==Style== His sculptures are modelled with harmony, peace and balance, based on nature as a precondition. They contrast with those of previous generations, differing from the exuberance of Kai Nielsen and the ornamentation of Johannes Bjerg and Einar Utzon-Frank. Many of his works have been carefully reproduced in various sizes.Dorthe Falcon Møller, \\"Gottfred Eickhoff\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon.

After college, Lewis joined the United States Army Air Forces (later, the US Air Force), and by the end of World War II, Lewis attained the rank of Captain. Lewis joined the Inquirer in 1946 and wrote almost exclusively about the Philadelphia Phillies until 1972. Lewis officially retired from the Inquirer in 1979. In 1981 he was inducted into the writer's wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, where he received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, the highest honor awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America. He served on the Veterans Committee of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum from 1979 to 2000. In that capacity, Lewis joined a group of Hall-of-Famers who were charged with nominating and voting in new Hall of Fame inductees. He also was the Chairman of Major League Baseball's Scoring Committee from 1960 to 1974. He was cited as \\"the foremost authority on baseball rules,\\" and was respected as a baseball historian who covered 24 World Series and witnessed 10 no-hitters. Former Phillies' owner, Ruly Carpenter, praised Lewis as probably having as good a knowledge of baseball and how it was meant to be played as some field managers. After retiring to Clearwater, Florida in the early 1980s, Lewis continued to follow the Phillies at their spring training camp in Clearwater, and was the first official scorer in 1998 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, until his final retirement in 2002. During his time in Clearwater, Lewis joined with Dunedin Mayor Cecil Englebert, as they served on the Pinellas County Sports Authority. According to Englebert, \\"Lewis was very involved in the work we did in the (sports authority) to get the Dome (now Tropicana Field) built, and we traveled together to a lot of baseball meetings throughout the country. He introduced me to many baseball greats that I would never have had the opportunity to meet.\\" In addition to writing for the Inquirer, Lewis also published four books on the Phillies and baseball history: * No-Hitters: The 225 Games, 1893-1999 (2000) * This Date in Philadelphia Phillies History (1992 - updated and republished in 2013) * Baseballs Greatest Streaks: The highs and lows of teams, pitchers, and hitters in the modern major leagues (1992) * The Philadelphia Phillies: A pictorial history (1981) ==External links== *Baseball Hall of Fame *Obituary Category:1916 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Sportswriters from Pennsylvania Category:Baseball writers Category:J.

It debuted in April 1991 and concluded in August 1991. It was the subject of much controversy at the time was a huge success which inspired two remakes; Victorinos (2009) produced also by R.T.I for Telemundo and Tres Milagros (2011) produced by Teleset for RCN TV. It is based on the 1970 novel of the same name by Miguel Otero Silva. == Plot == In 1963, a renowned mentalist named Norman Reinhart (Omar Sanchez) visits Colombia where his mental powers are broadcast through the radio and television. Two upper-class women, Sara Koppel of Umaña (Maribel Abello) and her aunt Rosalia Koppel (Margalida Castro) attend the show. The mentalist announces that Sara is pregnant and her unborn child will be named Victorino. He will be born on the same date and hour with other two babies also called Victorino, with whom he will share a deadly curse: The day that Victorino finds another Victorino and another Victorino, Victorino dies. During the same session the seer also foresees that the President of United States of America John F. Kennedy would be killed. Sara does not believe in the prophecy but then discovers she is pregnant and, on November 2 of 1963, she gives birth prematurely to her only son Victorino Umaña Koppel in an elegant clinic in Bogota, after her husband Rodrigo is discovered travelling with a lover in a phony job travel. The child is baptized by his grandparents Juan (Carlos Duplat) and Julia. Sara is terrified upon realizing that she has given her son the name prophesied by Reinhart. Meanwhile in a public hospital of the same city Victorino Perdomo Rangel is born of Romulo Perdomo (Edgardo Román), a humble barber and an ANAPO party member, and Amparo Rangel (Patricia Grisales), a housewife. The Perdomo family has two girls, Carola and Maria Eugenia, named after the wife and daughter of President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, respectively. Coincidentally Amparo is one of the people present during the show where Reinhart uttered the prophecy. Simultaneously Victorino Moya is born in a hovel in the hills around the city. Rubelia (Adelaida Otalora), his mother, is a maid employed by the Umaña-Koppel family. Ceferino (Alejandro Muñoz), Victorino's father, left his family to seek his fortune in the eastern plains and then Rubelia married Facundo (Álvaro Rodriguez), a worker who beats her when he's drunk and with whom she has two more children, Mireya and Guillermo. Over the years, the three Victorinos live in a completely different reality, each with his own family. The wealthy and handsome Victorino Umana (David Guerrero) studies in the best schools and graduates from the best university, travelling the world, going from one party to another party and wasting money on luxuries together with his best friend Juan Andres Alzate 'Juancho' (Andrés Marulanda) and his cousin Ana Maria Londoño Koppel (Alexandra Restrepo). Although his mother Sara, has zealously guarded the prophecy of Reinhart, Victorino resorts to Edmundo (Waldo Urrego), a leading senator and his mother's boyfriend, to look for his two namesake, but unsuccessfully. A typical rich kid, Victorino gets into trouble and scandals, marries his cousin Ana Maria, who is unfaithful to him with his friend 'Juancho' Alzate and, through him, starts doing business with 'The Southerner', a drug trafficker who has a pilot named Daniel Schumacher, who becomes their intermediary. Since his childhood, Victorino Perdomo (Ricardo Gómez) has great art activities, and is admitted into a seminary because his father does not have money to pay a private school. There he meets a seminary priest named Augustine Lajarreta (Luis Fernando Montoya) who becomes his mentor. After misunderstandings, scandals and a nonconformist attitude, he is expelled from the seminary while his father is sent to prison for political reasons. Years later, Victorino comes to the National University to study architecture. There he gets in touch with leftist ideals and meets Maria Helena aka 'Rosana' (Maria Fernanda Martínez), who talks him into joining a guerrilla group called 'Popular Defence'. Victorino Moya (Ramiro Meneses) does not have the same opportunities as his namesakes. He leads a life of crime together with his best friend 'The Black' (Ulises Colmenares). Victorino cannot cope with the mistreatment and abuse that his stepfather Facundo inflicts on his mother and his sister Mireya, so he murders him with a stolen gun. As a teenager he joins the 'Carroloco' and 'The Black' gangs. As adults, Victorino and his friend join a criminal group led by 'The Goose', 'The Blind' (Jorge Herrera) and 'Rapidol' (Horacio Tavera), the latter being a neighbour and friend of theirs. After robbing a bank and having a party to celebrate the coup leaders, Victorino receives the order to kill 'The Black' as proof of loyalty, but Victorino refuses and, when soon after 'The Black' is killed, Victorino makes his bosses believe that he did away with him. After trying to kill Schumacher, Victorino is arrested. In jail he meets his father Ceferino who helps him survive and, then, to escape from jail. Due to a money problem, his bosses order him to assassinate Schumacher. In 1983, when the three Victorinos become of age, the fatal encounter occurs. Victorino Umana, accompanied by 'Juancho' and Schumacher, head to Korean Bank to negotiate with the manager a loan to cover the loss he suffered in a Mexican drug shipment. Coincidentally Victorino Perdomo arrives at the bank accompanied by his guerrilla comrades to rob the bank, while also Victorino Moya appears with the task of killing Schumacher. Once in the bank there is a shootout between the guerrillas and the guards of the bank, in which Victorino Perdomo, Schumacher and 'Juancho' and other bank customers die. Victorino Moya is mortally wounded and flees the scene but bleeds to death shortly before arriving home. Victorino Umana remains unharmed and is interrogated by the police, when he denies that Schumacher had met his now dead namesake (whom he knew and had tried to meet). When Victorino Umana returns home. he tells Ana Maria that 'Juancho' died in the shootout and implores her in tears to flee since they are bankrupt and deeply indebted. She is furious and tells him that she loved 'Juancho', admitting that she had been unfaithful to her husband with him. She goes on saying that she has never loved him either, and they were together only because their families almost forced them to since they were kids, but his sole presence was causing her disgust. Eventually she leaves. Victorino bursts into tears and, disillusioned, takes a Walther PPK that Schumacher had given her and commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, in the precise moment when Ana Maria returns apparently regretting what she has said, but too late to prevent the tragedy. The funerals of the three Victorinos take place in the Central Cemetery of Bogotá, without any of the families of the deceased aware of what has happened to the others.

Their second season in tier 2 in 2000–01 resulted in relegation and then followed a period of decline, including the withdrawal of a main sponsor, which culminated in them playing in AF Algarve 2ª Divisão, the sixth tier of Portuguese football, in 2008–09.

In January 2005, at the age of 16, Kamešs was taken to the club's first team. He saw himself scoring in the first and only appearance he made that season, helping his team become the Latvian Higher League champions. Even though, Kamešs helped his team win the Latvian Football Cup in 2006, triumph in the Baltic League in 2007 and become the champions of Latvia once again in 2009, he did not play much. During 5 seasons the young player made only 28 league appearances, scoring 4 goals due to the fact that more experienced players were more likely to be chosen to play over him. ===Gulbene-2005=== In July 2010 Kamešs was loaned out to the Latvian First League club FB Gulbene-2005 in order to have a chance to play more. Surprisingly, the young player, netted 10 goals in 11 league appearances.

The 2012 season saw Kamešs as one of the club's key players, as he was a constant first eleven player, making 29 league appearances and scoring 10 goals.

After the season, he was also included in both – sportacentrs.com and LFF teams of the tournament, receiving the awards as the best midfielder of the season and the best player of the season in general. ===Amkar Perm=== In February 2013 Kamešs went on trial with the Russian Premier League club Amkar Perm. Participating in two of their pre-season training camps, in Turkey and Bulgaria, he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with them on 18 February. He chose to play with the no. 15 jersey. ===Pogoń Szczecin=== In February 2015, Kamešs left Amkar Perm by mutual consent, going on to sign for Pogoń Szczecin, which plays in the top tier of Polish football, the Ekstraklasa. ==International career== From 2006 to 2010 Vladimirs Kamešs was a member of Latvia U-19 and Latvia U-21.

Basel's 2012–13 Swiss Super League season began on 13 July 2012 with the away tie against Servette FC. The season started poorly, Basel won just three of their first nine games, drawing five with one defeat. They were in fourth position in the league table, eight points behind the leaders Grasshoppers, this even increased to eleven points just three weeks later. However, following the Management change in October, the team spirits improved and they played better. They ended the first half of the season in second position, had reduced the arrears to four points and had moved one point ahead of Sion and St. Gallen. In the second half of the season FC Sion lost their momentum completely and St. Gallen also lost contact to the first two positions in the league table. The Grasshoppers and Basel distanced themselves continually, but remained within a few points of each other. Basel took over the lead in the championship table and, mid-way through the second half of the season, started to open a gap to their last remaining rivals. Despite Grasshoppers winning the direct league fixture against Basel three games before the end of the season, Basel had acquired enough points to finish three points ahead of them and to win their fourth title in a row. Basel thus achieved their main aim that they had set for the season, in fact the league campaign can be described as being a successful one.  Domestic Cup  Basel's clear aim for the Swiss Cup is to retain the title. The Cup holders started in the 2012–13 Swiss Cup first round on 15 September with the away game against FC Amriswil, a team from the OFV (Ostschweizer Fussballverband) Regional 2. Liga and this tie was won 6–1. In the second round they were drawn away against FC Chiasso, this tie was won 4–1. For the third round tie Basel were drawn, again away from home, against Locarno and passed into the next round with a 3–2 victory, but needed for the winning goal. The Quarterfinals were played on 27 February 2013 and Basel were drawn away from home against FC Thun in a tie that was won 2–1, yet again this victory need extra time. Drawn away in the semifinal against Sion on 17 April 2013 Basel advanced to the final thanks to the only goal of the game scored by Valentin Stocker. The final was played on Whit Monday in the Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf in Bern. The opponents were the Grasshoppers. Basel lost the Final 3–4 on penalties, the game had ended 1-1 after extra time. Basel missed their aimed cup win, but the cup campaign can be described as being a successful one.  Champions League  Because Basel entered the Champions League in the qualifying phase their initial aim is to reach the group stage. They were drawn against Estonian club Flora Tallinn winning 5–0 on aggregate and in the third round they were drawn against Norwegian club Molde FK winning 2–1 on aggregate. However, in the play-off round Basel lost both games against CFR Cluj from Rumainia (being knocked out 3–1 on aggregate). Therefore, the initial aim was failed. Europa League Because the losing teams from the Champions League play- off round were eligible for the group stage of the Europa League, Basels next aim was to remain in this European competition over the winter break. Basel were drawn into Group G along with Sporting Clube de Portugal, K.R.C. Genk and Videoton FC. As they finished the Group in second position they advanced to the knockout phase round of 32. Therefore, their second aim was achieved. In the round of 32 Basel were drawn against the Ukrainian Premier League team Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Basel progressed 3–1 on aggregate, winning the home tie and drawing away. Their aims were subsequently revised again and this aim was stated as reaching the quarter-finals. In the round of 16 they were drawn against Zenit St. Petersburg and despite being the underdogs, by winning 2–1 on aggregate, they qualified for the next round. Basel were drawn against Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final. Spurs were beaten 4–1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 4-4 aggregate draw to progress to the semi-finals. The draw for the semi-final matched the against reigning UEFA Champions League holders Chelsea. Both games in the tie ended with a defeat, 1–2 in Basel 1–3 in London. Despite these two defeats Basel's European aims were achieved, in fact the campaign can be described as a very successful one. == Players  First team squad = Out on loan ===  === Transfers Summer 2012 ===  In    Out   === Transfers Winter 2012–13 ===  In    Out   == Results and fixtures  Legend =Friendly matches=== Preseason  Winter break  === Swiss Super League === Kickoff times are in CET First half of season  Second half of season  League table =Results summary= === Swiss Cup = UEFA Champions League === Qualifying rounds =Second qualifying round= =Third qualifying round= Playoff round === UEFA Europa League === Group stage Knockout phase Round of 32 Basel won 3–1 on aggregate.

Derivation is from the Protocycloceratidae, a family of ellesmerocerids, which differ in having straight or concave siphuncle segments, but are otherwise similar in form. Apocrinoceratidae was established by Rousseau Flower (in Flower & Teichert, 1957) repeated in Flower (1964) for the genus Apocrinoceras (Teichert & Glenister, 1954). Four additional genera are included; Desioceras and Glenisteroceras (Flower and Teichert 1957, Flower 1964),Bakeroceras (Hook and Flower 1977), and Paldoceras (Kröger et al 2009). Apocrinoceratidae was removed from the Ellesmerocerida to the Discosorida by Kröger et al (2009) based in the inclusion of Paldoceras interpreted as a morphologic intermediary between Apocrinoceras and Reudemannoceras. Paldoceras however is rather dissimilar, being more strongly cyrtoconic (curved) and lacking the characteristic annulations. ==References== * Rousseau H Flower and Curt Teichert, 1957.

Travis' letter \\"To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World\\" and died while defending the Alamo garrison. He is a member of the Old Eighteen and Immortal 32. ==Early life and career== Martin's grave (cenotaph) memorial in Providence, RI, referencing the Alamo Martin's grave (cenotaph) memorial in Providence, RI Martin was born in Providence, Rhode Island to Joseph S. Martin, a merchant, and Abbey B. Martin. Martin's parents were fourth cousins, and both of their fathers both fought in the Revolutionary War. Albert Martin attended Vermont's Norwich University, which was then known as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. Then, following his father, a merchant, and older brothers, Albert Martin left Rhode Island in 1832 and went to Texas by way of Tennessee and New Orleans, where he joined Martin, Coffin & Company. With his growing family, Martin eventually moved to Gonzales, Texas by 1835 where he ran a successful general store business affiliated with Martin, Coffin & Co. ==Texas RevolutionSoldier=== At the outbreak of the Texas revolution, Martin was one of the defenders of Gonzales known as the \\"Old Eighteen,\\" who protected the \\"Come and Take It\\" cannon. He was part of the Texas force during the Siege of Bexar in the fall of 1835 and then by December returned to Gonzales to recover from an ax injury for a period before returning to Bexar.Bill Groneman, \\"MARTIN, ALBERT,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed May 28, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. ===Alamo courier=== On February 23, 1836, the first day of the siege of the Alamo, Lt. Col. William B. Travis sent Captain Martin as an emissary to meet Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna's adjutant, Col. Juan N. Almonte. Almonte rejected Martin's invitation to come to the Alamo and speak directly to Travis. The next day, Martin left the Alamo carrying Travis's famous letter \\"To the People of Texas,\\" which he delivered to Lancelot Smither in Gonzales. ===Ranger Captain=== In Gonzales, a relief force was organized to support the Alamo's scant defenders despite Martin's father's warnings not to return to the Alamo. On March 1, 1836 Martin returned to the Alamo with the supporting force from Gonzales, numbering approximately thirty-two. On March 6, 1836 Martin was killed in the Battle of the Alamo.Daughters of the American Revolution, The Alamo Heroes and Their Revolutionary Ancestors (San Antonio, 1976). Michael R.

Mr. Martin had a large establishment in Gonzales, about 150 miles from San Antonio where for the last year or two he had been carrying on an extensive business. He had left the fortress and returned to his residence, where he was apprised of the perilous situation in which his late comrades were placed. His determination was instantly taken. In reply to the passionate entreaties of his father, who besought him not to rush into certain destruction, he said 'This is no time for such considerations. I have passed my word to Colonel Travers, that I would return, nor can I forfeit a pledge thus given.' In pursuance of this high resolve he raised a company of sixty-two men and started on his way back. During the route, the company, apprised of the desperate situation of affairs, became diminished by desertion, to thirty-two. With this gallant band he gained the fort and the reinforcement, small as it was, revived the drooping spirits of the garrison ....Thus died Albert Martin, a not unapt illustration of New England heroism. He has left a family, and perhaps a Nation to lament his loss, and he had bequeathed to that family an example of heroic and high- minded chivalry which can never be forgotten and which is worthy of the best days of Sparta or of Rome.\\" ==Legacy== In the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island there is a slender, red stone memorial marker from 1858 or earlier that states \\"Albert Martin Fell at the Alamo, Texas, In Defense of his country March 6, 1836, Aged 28 yrs & 2 mo's.\\"Legendary Texas 2: The Promised Land [Paperback] Jeff Carroll (Author) September 30, 1999 Within the cemetery, the memorial is near Central, Summit, and Elm Avenues and is Rhode Island's only memorial to the Alamo.

The Custom House was the headquarters of the Local Government Board for Ireland, an agency of the British administration in Ireland, against which the IRA was fighting in the name of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic. The operation, involving over 100 IRA volunteers, was a propaganda coup for the republicans but a military disaster for the IRA in the Irish capital. A force of British Auxiliaries quickly arrived and a gun battle erupted. Five IRA volunteers were killed, along with three civilians, and about 80 volunteers were captured.Today in Irish History - The Burning of the Custom House - The Irish Story ==Background== The Irish War of Independence was a guerrilla campaign by the IRA in support of the Irish Republic. The conflict entered its bloodiest phase in the first six months of 1921. In Dublin, a total of 309 people were killed in the conflict and several hundred more wounded.Eunan O'Halpin, \\"Counting Terror\\", in, David Fitzpatrick Ed., Terror in Ireland 1916-1923. p152 Dublin was garrisoned by over 10,000 British troops and 1,600 police including 400 men of the RIC Auxiliary Division.Sheehan, William. Fighting for Dublin, The British battle for Dublin 1919-1921. p125 Most IRA actions in the city consisted either of assassinations of selected police, military or administration figures by the Squad, or ambushes on British forces by one of the four Active Service Units of the IRA's Dublin Brigade (together comprising about 100 men). These were usually rapid and fleeting attacks using grenades and handguns, followed by a quick getaway. There were strict orders given to IRA units to avoid prolonged engagements with the better-armed British forces. However, this policy was reversed after a meeting of the Ministry of Dáil Éireann in May 1921 where the President of the Republic, Éamon de Valera, called for a spectacular public show of force by the IRA, to reinforce the idea that it was an army representing an Irish government. For this reason it was decided to attack and burn the Custom House, which, although an important government building, was not defended by the British military. Michael Collins was against the attack but was overruled.Dwyer, T Ryle. The Squad and the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins. pp240-244 IRA member Vincent Byrne said that the operation was \\"one of many under review\\" and that another proposal had been to attack Beggars Bush Barracks.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0423.pdf#page=19 ==The attack== In the early afternoon of 25 May 1921, roughly 120 non- uniformed IRA Volunteers began to gather around the Custom House in groups of twos and threes. 75 percent of those involved belonged to the 2nd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade under Tom Ennis. Only a minority of them were experienced guerrilla fighters and they were armed only with pistols and a limited amount of ammunition. At 1pm, they rushed the Custom House and overpowered the police guard. A lorry pulled-up outside the building with tins of petrol and bales of cotton, which were then sprinkled throughout the building. The IRA Volunteers herded all the staff into the main hall. The caretaker of the building was shot dead when he tried to call the police. However, at about 1:10pm, a watching policeman notified British forces and 60 Auxiliaries in three lorries and an armored car quickly arrived on the scene. IRA Volunteers from the 1st, 3rd and 4th battalions were positioned outside the building to stop the enemy from approaching. Four Auxiliaries were wounded in a gun battle with one of these IRA protection teams outside the building. Other Auxiliaries fired into the building with rifles and Lewis machine guns, exchanging fire with the IRA fighters inside. A number of IRA Volunteers and civilians were killed or wounded by the Auxiliaries.Dwyer, pp. 244-248 As fighting raged outside, IRA Volunteers inside the building were ordered to set it alight. The ammunition of the IRA Volunteers quickly ran out and the firefight ended within 30 minutes. Some Volunteers were shot as they tried to run away. Tom Ennis, in command of the operation, escaped but was hit twice in the leg. Many others were arrested along with civilians as they came out of the now burning Custom House with their hands up. The Fire Brigade, which had been delayed from responding by other IRA companies in the city, arrived too late to put out the fire. British military forces composed of units from the Wiltshire Regiment arrived and took over the operation from the Auxiliaries at this point. A total of 111 people were arrested of whom 70–80 were IRA members.Sheehan, p. 53 The Custom House burned for five days and was all but completely destroyed by the fire. With it were destroyed many centuries of local government records. The Irish Bulletin, official gazette of the Irish Republic, reported: ==Aftermath== From the republican point of view, the operation was successful for its propaganda value, but it was a heavy blow in terms of the numbers lost, both killed and arrested. Following the operation, the Dublin Brigade and The Squad were amalgamated into the Dublin Guard. However, the operation did not disable totally the IRA's campaign in Dublin. The Dublin Brigade carried out 107 attacks in the city in May and 93 in June, showing a fall-off but not a dramatic one.Hopkinson, Michael. The Irish War of Independence. p102 The memoir of Harry Colley, Adjutant of the Dublin IRA, estimated the numbers in the 5 Dublin battalions at 1,400 in early 1921.Colley, Sen. H., (1957) BMH file WS 1687, page 74. The armed conflict was brought to an end on 11 July 1921 and negotiations were opened which would produce the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December of that year. The Custom House was re-built after the end of the war. Irish local government records from the 1600s had been brought from rural parts of Ireland to the Custom House for safekeeping, and these were lost in the blaze. As the time, The New York Times subtitled their report on the fire as \\"Priceless Records Lost\\". Some genealogists still lament the loss of these historical records. ==References== Category:1921 in Ireland Category:History of Dublin (city) Custom House Category:Royal Irish Constabulary Category:May 1921 events Category:1920s in Dublin (city) ","title":"Burning of the Custom House"},{"id":"35962976","text":"Riddle of the Seventh Stone is a 2010 novel by Monideepa Sahu. This fantasy novel for children is set in Bangalore, India. The book was longlisted for the Vodafone Crossword Book Award for 2011. ==Plot summary== Set in a herb shop on a bustling road in Bangalore, this book is about a spider and rat magically turning into human children. As children with help from their vermin friends the duo gang up with the grandchildren of the herb shop owner to save it from a land shark. In the course of their adventures they come across an ancient riddle, solving which leads them to the treasure of Kempegowda, an ancient king who founded Bangalore. The vermin's transformation to humans in nature and thinking, and their improving in the face of adversity is an underlying theme of the book. Many places described in the book are in the old parts of Bangalore dating back to the times of the city's founding. The City Market, Avenue Road, Bangalore Fort and Kote Venkataramana Temple are real places. ==Characters== * Rishab: the aged rat who transforms into a shy and awkward boy. He overcomes his shyness to become the hero of the novel by solving the riddle of the seventh stone, finding the treasure and becoming friends with a girl called Geeta whom he saved from an accident. * Shashie: the very old spider who transforms into a bossy and opinionated girl. She plays a pivotal role in the novel. * Venkat Thatha: the owner of the rare herb store, an absent-minded old man worried about the future of his shop * Ajji: Venkat Thata's wife, deaf but practical * The twins Leela and Deepak: orphaned grandchildren of Venkat Thatha. They discover and try to civilize Rishab and Shashie. * Shark: the mysterious scar-faced villain who doubles as a loan shark and a land shark out to snatch the store * Minor characters like the wise bandicoot and the helpful policeman * Numerous insects and rats who bravely help Rishab and his friends in their quest Kote Venkataramana Temple ==Development and Publication== Monideepa Sahu got the idea of writing this book after meeting the owner of a shop selling rare herbs while doing research for an article for the newspaper Deccan Herald. A big spider weaving a web in a corner of the shop and a rat scurrying about the shop were the inspiration behind the main characters of the book, Rishab and Shashee. In the course of the author's conversations with long-term residents of Old Bangalore, she learnt about local life, and discovered old temples, churches and mosques. Hearing tales of local life, temple chariot festivals, the early morning flower market etc., related by people from diverse communities, inspired the characters and plot of her book. Although the book was written in 2003 it was rejected by a number of publishers for failing to follow established stereotypes, before being selected by Zubaan in 2008 as an anonymous pitch in the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival. The book was formally launched in Bangalore on 9 October 2010. ==Reviews== A review in The Hindu noted the unusual storyline and praised the book for a realistic portrayal of children and language. The reviewer praised Rishab as an adorable character and appreciated the book's humorous touches but found the decoding of the riddle weak. The Deccan Herald appreciated the fact that this novel as a fantasy set in India unlike most children's books. They noted the mix of adventure, fantasy, insects, vermin and a little bit of love made the novel fast-paced. The Bangalore Mirror found the description of Bangalore's underworld populated with rodents and roaches and not crooks, as a world full of fantasy and adventure in the labyrinths of drains and nooks of the old Bangalore. Ranjana Kaul in the Book Review noted the \\"unlikely protagonists drawn from the world of vermin and insects, a world which humans generally tend to ignore or treat with disgust and repulsion. The book straddles these two antithetical yet interdependent worlds with ease through its unlikely heroes, the rat Rishabh and the bossy spider Shashee (spelt with a double 'e' for astrological reasons!) who find themselves catapulted unwillingly into the world of humans.\\" It has been noted, apart from nuggets of history of Bangalore, the novel also deals with ecological concerns, coexistence and the discovery of self-reliance. However, the author has denied having put in a moral in the book. ==External links== * The publisher's webpage on the book ==See also== Going home in the rain ==References== Category:2010 Indian novels Category:Fantasy novels Category:Adventure novels Category:Indian English-language novels Category:Indian children's novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Children's mystery novels Category:Novels set in India Category:Novels set in Bangalore Category:Culture of Bangalore Category:Postcolonial literature Category:Children's novels about animals Category:Novels about friendship Category:Fictional mice and rats Category:2010 children's books Category:2010 debut novels ","title":"Riddle of the Seventh Stone"},{"id":"35962986","text":"Marcus Kretzer (born May 9, 1965 in Hilden, Germany) is a German pianist and music teacher.

Quiñones Motta; July 20, 1959) is a Puerto Rican screenwriter, film director, producer, entrepreneur and philanthropist who divides his time between filmmaking and advocating for improvements in public education in countries around the world, such as Brazil, Puerto Rico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, Argentina, Spain, Mexico and the United States of America. He won an Emmy for his work and currently does motivational speaking now that he is in a wheelchair due to a spinal-chord disease. ==Early life== Quiñones was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, the son of Santiago Quiñones Elías, a lawyer and Miriam Motta Ferrer, a homemaker. He attended primary school and secondary school in Puerto Rico and, at the age of 18, he left Puerto Rico to study cinematography and film-making at Columbia College and UCLA in Hollywood, California. He graduated at age 21. ==Career== 17 While still in high school, Quiñones completed his first film, a thirty-minute piece called Seniors, which was shot entirely on 16mm film and featured his classmates. After he produced a film for his high school's talent show, Quiñones's decided to pursue a career as a filmmaker. Upon completion of his education in California, Quiñones returned to his Puerto Rico, and established a production company that produced television commercials for international clients. Profits from his commercial work allowed Quiñones to produce his first feature film, Columbus' Legacy (original title: Raíces Eternas) on the history and evolution of Puerto Rican culture. The film was played in Old San Juan in 2019 during the 500th anniversary of San Juan, Puerto Rico commemoration. In 1985, he produced Columbus' Legacy, which was narrated in its English version by Oscar-winning Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer. In 1986, the film won a Silver Award in the Houston International Film Festival. In 1989, he produced The Bell and San Juan Story, and worked with artists such as writer/director Jacobo Morales, and actresses Cordelia González and Rosanna DeSoto. These films garnered Quiñones fourteen awards in local and international festivals. In 1994, he collaborated with Tom Musca and playwright Mark Kemble to produce Flight of Fancy (2000), which was the winner of Best Film with a Latin theme at the Hollywood International Film Festival and Best Film at The Renaissance City Film Festival in Rhode Island, both in 2001. Quinõnes' film work also includes 17 (original title: Los 17), a documentary about educational transformation in Puerto Rico, which was the winner of Best Short Documentary at the Rincón International Film Festival in Rincón, Puerto Rico in 2012. He also produced 100,000, a documentary about the problem of stray dogs in Puerto Rico. He produced the documentary \\"One on One\\" (original title: \\"Uno a Uno\\"), which examines the cycle of poverty and crime for students that drop out of school, and presents his mentorship program that works to keep students in school. ==Speaking career== Quinones at TEDxSanJuan In addition to filmmaking, Quiñones works as a motivational speaker to advocate for quality in public education. In December 2011, he was one of eleven speakers invited to the first TEDx SanJuan symposium in Puerto Rico. He spoke about how public education can be transformed by an integrated program to motivate and prepare students for the academic rigors they must address in order to succeed. ==Philanthropic activities== While touring schools that were screening his film, Flight of Fancy, Quiñones and his wife observed the run- down condition of the classrooms, the dearth of technology, and the lack of disciplinary structure present at these schools. In 2005, after four years of interviewing students, teachers, administrators and parents, he established the philanthropic organization Operation Éxito to improve the quality of Puerto Rico's public education system. Operation Éxito's goal is to use technology and motivational strategies to develop skills and inquisitive attitudes among students towards learning science and mathematics. Since its inception, Operation Éxito has evolved beyond Puerto Rico to other Spanish- speaking countries, as well as the United States of America. Quiñones observed that students who drop out of school prematurely frequently begin a family and financially support themselves with multiple minimum wage jobs or crime. In 2012, he developed the One on One (original title: Uno a Uno) program to increase graduation rates and improve the future quality of life for students who were performing poorly in school. One on One matches certified mentors recruited from successful community and business leaders with at-risk students to improve their academic performance. The program was initiated in a school in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico where graduation rates were as low as 49%, and almost 100% of the participants graduated from high school. In 2017, the US Conference of Mayors presented the city of Aguadilla with its High Achievement Livability award for cities with 100,000 inhabitants or less for the implementation and results of the One On One program. Quiñones's philanthropic efforts are also directed at the Sor Isolina Ferré Center and its dedication to the transformation of communities and society in general through education. He also supports the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. ==Filmography== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"LightSteelBlue\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Alsop built several notable houses in Spotsylvania County including Kenmore, Spotswood Inn, and Fairview. Oakley was part of a grant of given to Gawain Corbin by the King of England. Alsop bought in 1816. The Georgian home was built using bricks made in two kilns that Alsop built on the property. Oakley, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1935 Oakley is located near the site of many major battles of the American Civil War. A number of battles and skirmishes occurred on or near the property. According to a letter written by a resident of the house at the time, during one two-day period, the house was ransacked by \\"...at least 2000 soldiers tramping through the house.\\" A Yankee soldier disobeyed his Major's orders to burn the house down. During the latter half of the 19th century, the house was neglected and used more as a barn than a home. In 1919, the property was purchased by a Mr. McHenry who wanted to mine for silver and gold. The mining project failed and, in 1926, the plantation was sold to George C. Beals. The property has been owned by the Beals since then. Running water and electricity were added in the 1940s and central heating in the 1960s. As of 2005, the Oakley farm consisted of nearly .

The house was built in 1840 on land that was purchased by Jonathan Johnson in 1829. Markings on the exposed oak beams indicate that Walnut Grove was built by William A. Jennings. Jennings was recognized as a master builder of Greek Revival homes during that period. Walnut Grove was added to the National Register of Historic Places in August 2004. ==Design and construction== Walnut grove is a five-bay house with a raised brick basement. The front porch is distinctive Greek Revival. The flat porch roof over the entrance is supported by four square Tuscan columns joined by the original balustrades. The entry is adorned with carved sidelights and a leaded tracery transom. The shutters on the basement and first floor windows are original. The roof is hipped. The house's floor plan is L-shaped. Like the front entrance, the rear porch roof rests on Tuscan columns. The house has three brick interior-end chimneys. Oak beams in the hallway, kitchen, and dining room walls are exposed. These beams show Roman numerals indicating where joists are to be attached. These markings are identical to markings in Edgewood, another of Jennings' houses. Little has changed in the appearance of Walnut Grove since the mid-1800s. On the grounds, there is the original smokehouse, as well as the stone fireplace of the 18th century Coleman house that was built at Walnut Grove prior to the current house. This fireplace was once the kitchen for the home. In the 1980s the Bond house, an 18th-century building, was moved from Louisa County, Virginia to Walnut Grove. The restoration of this building, which currently serves as a bed and breakfast, was recognized by the Spotsylvania Preservation Foundation. The grounds also feature an English garden, vegetable gardens, orchards, and a vinyard. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Greek Revival houses in Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1840 Category:Houses in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Spotsylvania County, Virginia ","title":"Walnut Grove (Spotsylvania County, Virginia)"},{"id":"35963063","text":"Detail from one of the Marble Bridge pavilions Petzold's Neptune statue at Børsen in Copenhagen ¨Johan Christoph Petzold (5 October 1708 - 15 September 1762) was a German sculptor who mainly worked in Denmark. He was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from its establishment in 1754 and briefly held the post of Sculptor to the Danish Court. ==Biography== Born in Wünschendorf,There are two places in Saxony called Wünschendorf: one now within Dürrröhrsdorf-Dittersbach and one now within Pockau-Lengefeld. After three centuries, it may be impossible to determine which one was Petzold's birthplace. Saxony, Petzold had his training with Balthasar Permoser in Dresden, Andreas Schlüter in Berlin and Georg Rafael Donner in Vienna. He worked in Denmark from 1739 until 1757 interrupted by a one and a half year period from 1746 to October 1748 when he worked at the castle in Potsdam. His first work in Denmark, a relief for a pediment and a statue at the naval headquarters at Gammelholm in Copenhagen, from 1739–40, was lost in the Great Fire of 1795. Other lost works include seven statues for Hirschholm Palace (1741) and three for Frederiksdalin Lyngby (1745). From 1742, he worked on the sculpture groups of the Marble Bridge' pavilions at Christiansborg Palace and in 1744 and 1745 he created two large statues of Neptune and Mercury at Børsen (the originals are now in the Museum of Copenhagen). After Petzold's return to Denmark from Berlin, he initially worked on decorations for Christiansborg Palace (1749–50). The most prolific period of his career came in the 1750s when he carried out the rich decorations of the facade of Moltke's Mansion, one of the four Amalienborg mansions, as well as sculpture for Frederiks Hospital. His contributions at the hospital include the relief of the Good Samaritan in the pediment above the main entrance towards Bredgade. From 1751 he was a professor at the predecessor of the Royal Art Academy and from its opening in 1754 until 1757 at the Art Academy. In 1755 he was appointed Sculptor to the Danish Court. However, Jacques Saly's appointment to director of the Art Academy in 1743 heralded a new era and although Petzold was no stranger to the Neoclassical style, he continued to prefer that of the Rococo. After a few years he gave up his position as professor and left Copenhagen, settling in Altona. He died in Schönfeld where he is also buried. ==References== Category:Danish sculptors Category:German sculptors Category:German male sculptors Category:1708 births Category:1762 deaths ","title":"Johann Christoph Petzold"},{"id":"35963065","text":"Vikram Vij (born 1964)Vikram Vij of Vij's - Biography Vancouver, BC starchefs, June 2011. is an Indian-born Canadian chef, cookbook author, and television personality.

Vij later became a certified sommelier. ==Career== After working in Salzburg and Vienna for a few years, Vij moved to Canada in 1989, when he joined the Banff Springs Hotel, Alberta, Canada. From 1992 until 1994, Vij worked at Bishop's restaurant in Vancouver, British Columbia, for prominent Canadian chef John Bishop. Eventually in 1994, at the age of 30 he opened a fine-dining restaurant, Vij's, in Vancouver, soon to be joined in business by his wife Meeru Dhalwala. In the early days his parents would make the curry at their home and deliver it by bus to the restaurant.\\"Flavours of Vij's excellent adventure\\", Vancouver Sun, September 20, 2006. By 2003, Mark Bittman of The New York Times was praising Vij's Restaurant as \\"easily among the finest Indian restaurants in the world\\". A decade later in 2004, Vij and Dhalwala opened a second restaurant and market, the casual-style Rangoli.

It was headquartered in Ioannina and comprised the 8th (Ioannina) and 9th (Preveza) infantry divisions, covering the Greco-Albanian border in Epirus. At the time of its establishment, the Corps's zone also included Northern Epirus, which had come under Greek control during the First Balkan War. The Corps withdrew its units from there in February 1914, which led to an uprising of the local Greek population. In October 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the region was reoccupied with the assent of the Entente powers. Following the Greek mobilization in September 1915, V Corps expanded to include the 8th, 9th, 15th, and 16th Infantry Divisions. The corps was demobilized and disbanded as a result of the National Schism and the Greek demobilization in late 1916. It was re-established with the July 1926 Army reorganization, but disbanded again a year later. It was re-established again in 1935, this time based in Alexandroupoli, covering Western Thrace with the 12th Infantry Division at Komotini, and the islands of the eastern Aegean with the 13th Infantry Division. However, with the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940, all available forces were switched to Epirus, and on 15 December 1940, V Corps was disbanded and its name transferred to the \\"K\\" Group of Divisions on the Albanian front. The latter was a corps-sized battle group, formed on 11 November to facilitate the Greek counter-attack against the Italians. It came under the operational control of Western Macedonia Army Section (TSDM) and was named after its commander, Lt. Gen. Georgios Kosmas. On 10 March 1941, when Kosmas was transferred to command of I Army Corps, V Army Corps was finally disbanded and its component units directly subordinated to TSDM. == Sources == * * == External links == * OOB of Army Corps \\"E\\" in 1939 5 Category:Military units and formations established in 1913 Category:1913 establishments in Greece Category:1941 disestablishments in Greece Category:Military units and formations of Greece in World War I Category:Military units and formations of Greece in World War II Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1941 ","title":"V Army Corps (Greece)"},{"id":"35963182","text":"Wren's Cathedral Wren's Cathedral, properly the Church of St Leonard and now a cathedral of the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches, was originally the Lady Chapel of Wroxall Priory. Wroxall Priory was founded in 1141 as the Priory of St. Leonard for nuns at Wroxall, Warwickshire by Sir Hugh-Hatton, eldest son of the Earl of Warwick. He fought in the Crusades and was released after being held prisoner for seven years in Jerusalem and having a vision of St. Leonard, the patron saint of prisoners. He so appreciated the intervention of the saint that he gave 3,000 acres of land to the church in Wroxall to form a monastery for nuns after the Order of St. Benedict which was named the Priory of St. Leonard at Wroxall. A list of the Prioresses up to 1535 and further list of ministers from 1538 circa to the present can be found on the official website. A Charter issued by Pope Alexander III to the Priory of St. Leonard will also be found on the same web site. ==History== With the separation of the Church from Rome in 1535, Henry VIII allowed Robert Burgoyne to purchase the estate for just under £600 after he had demolished the Monastery and Church adjacent to the present Wren's Cathedral. With the rubble he built an Elizabethan house. The Lady Chapel was kept and designated St. Leonard Parish Church of Wroxall (Church of England). Some of the ruins of the larger Church and traces of the Priory can be seen across the present driveway. Chaplains (ministers) were appointed by the owner of the Estate from about 1538c. The estate at this time also took the title of Abbey i.e. Wroxall Abbey. The red brick tower and three bells in the church date from 1663–1664. Richard Shakespeare, the grandfather of William Shakespeare, was bailiff for the church in 1534, according to Michael Wood in his documentary In Search of Shakespeare (2003). One of the Prioresses, Isabella (1501), was William Shakespeare's great-aunt. Joan Shakespeare (1524) was his aunt. In 1713, Sir Christopher Wren purchased the estate as his country residence. While he is buried at St Paul's Cathedral, his wife and family are buried at Wroxall. His coat of arms is displayed on the south side of the present cathedral. In 1861 the Dugdale family purchased the estate and had the present Mansion House built after demolishing the previous house. The church was also internally renovated by the architect who designed the house. His name was Ryland. He later wrote a History of Wroxall Abbey (1903). Much of the information contained here is described in this publication. A girls' school, the Wroxall Abbey Girls School, was founded in the Mansion House in 1936, when the proprietors of the School leased 27 acres of the property, including the church. Ministers continued to be appointed during this period. The school closed together with the church in 1995. ==Present use== In 2001 the church was re-opened by the new owners and a large Free Methodist Church, the Renewal Christian Centre in Solihull agreed to provide the ministry. The church was renamed Wren’s Chapel in honour of its former illustrious owner. Regular Sunday services were commenced, and marriages, wedding blessings, child dedications and funerals were conducted by two designated ministers. In 2009 the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches (CEEC) were wishing to establish a fellowship diocese in the United Kingdom and based its headquarters in Wroxall Abbey. The ministers at the Abbey were re-consecrated into the CEEC, and later that year a bishop was appointed to oversee the diocese. At the same time the Order of St. Leonard (OSL) was established with the aim of bringing together Laity and ordained ministers from all over the world. The order has in two years developed into several countries in Europe and Africa so that an Arch-diocese of Wroxall Abbey has now been established at Wroxall. ==References== * ==External links== *Official website *Order of St. Leonard Category:Churches in Warwickshire Category:Grade I listed churches in Warwickshire ","title":"Wren's Cathedral"},{"id":"35963210","text":"Eurytium is a genus of crab in the family Panopeidae, containing the following species: *Eurytium affine (Streets & Kingsley, 1877) *Eurytium albidigitum Rathbun, 1933 *Eurytium limosum (Say, 1818) *Eurytium tristani Rathbun, 1906 ==References== Category:Xanthoidea ","title":"Eurytium"},{"id":"35963215","text":"Alvin Crockett (October 19, 1831 – July 9, 1902) was the first mayor of Logan, Utah and later served for 15 years as sheriff of Cache County, Utah.

It was announced by Honda in January 2012 at the Delhi Auto Expo, and was available to consumers in India in May 2012. At 44,642 Indian Rupees, the motorcycle is billed as one of the least expensive Honda motorcycle currently produced, and the least expensive Honda motorcycle ever made, adjusting for inflation. In order to compete with the predominant Hero MotoCorp, Honda launched a new variant called Dream Neo at an even lower price in 2013. And in 2014 the still cheaper Honda CD 110 Dream followed. Since 2013 the Dream Yuga comes with a more fuel efficient HET engine, the same that is used in the two other motorcycles. From November 2018, Bangladesh Honda Private Limited (BHL) started the manufacturing of Honda Dream Neo 110 in Bangladesh. https://www.bdhonda.com/media-center/pr- details/80 == Variants == Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India has other models in this 110cc segment that are more or less variants of the Dream Yuga but may not have all the features or may have different features to cater to wider customers and competition from manufacturers like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto in the 100-110cc segment. Although all models keep the same 110cc engine coupled with same 4-speed gearbox, as well as the diamond-style chassis frame. === Dream Neo === Prominent differences from Dream Yuga are the inclusion of goods-carrier rear handle-grip, yellow turn-indicators, and different head- lamp style. Rest of the features are kept unchanged. === CD110 Dream DX === This is the lowest priced variant. Prominent differences inherit all changes from Dream Neo, plus the bike doesn't get the black-themed engine and alloy wheels, both of which keep the aluminium shade of color. Previous versions of this bike came without auto-start (kick-start only), spoked-wheels and tube- based tires, to keep costs down for intended customers. But new models since 2018 have both auto-start and alloy-tubeless features. ==References ' Dream Yuga Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2012 Category:Standard motorcycles ","title":"Honda Dream Yuga"},{"id":"35963312","text":"{ style=\\"margin:5px; border:1px solid #87CEFF;\\" align=\\"right\\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 width=280 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#87CEFF\\"  colspan = 2 AC Diomidis Argous - align=\\"center\\"  colspan = 2logo - align=\\"center\\"  colspan = 2 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Founded  1976 - align=\\"center\\"  Full Name AC Diomidis Argous - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Arena  Argos Municipal Athletic Center (capacity: 500 seats) - align=\\"center\\"  League  Handball Premier - align=\\"center\\"  2017-18  Handball Premier, 5th - align=\\"center\\"  Club Colours  Green & White - align=\\"center\\" European titles 1 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Website  www.diomidis-handball.gr } AC Diomidis Argous is a team handball club from Argos, Greece.

He was a consulting architect to the United States government from 1905 to 1914. ==Biography== He was born on June 19, 1872 in Akron, Ohio.His tombstone uses June 19, 1872, perhaps that is the baptismal date. June 17, 1872 comes from the transcription of Ohio Births and Christenings, 1821-1962, perhaps that has been mistranscribed. He was educated at Yale University, and École des Beaux-Arts in Paris During the early years of American reconstruction in the Philippines, at the height of the City Beautiful movement, the former Governor-General of the Philippines (and future U.S. president), Howard Taft, initiated a comprehensive building construction and city planning in the country.Rea, Bronson (1907-03). \\"The Far Eastern Review Vols. 3-4 - Details and description of the Burnham plans for the reconstruction of Manila\\", pg.322. Far Eastern, Manila. He was the United States Secretary of War when he instructed William Cameron Forbes, then a member of the Philippine Commission, to engage competent advice on this subject. He induced architect Daniel H. Burnham, the leading spirit in the architectural design and construction of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, to visit the islands, which he did together with his designer, Pierce Anderson, making general preliminary plans for the cities of Manila and Baguio. This was followed by the recommendation that an architect of suitable training and experience be appointed as consulting architect for the Government.A.N. Rebori (1917-04). (\\"Architectural Record, Vol. 41 - The Work of William Parsons in the Philippine Islands\\". pp. 305-309. Architectural Record, Ltd, New York. Parsons was recommended by Burnham and appointed for the job. At the time of his selection he was practicing architecture in New York City, having recently graduated from École des Beaux-Arts, Paris. With enthusiastic ambition, the best heritage of a thorough French training, he went to Manila in November, 1905. Under the terms of his appointment as a consulting architect created by the Philippine Commission Act No. 1495 (enacted May 26, 1906), he was given general architectural supervision over the design of all public buildings and parks throughout the islands, including provincial and municipal work as well as insular. Consequently, he was charged with interpretation of the preliminary plans prepared by Messrs. Burnham and Anderson for Manila and Baguio. It remained for the American architect to establish city plans and buildings of a permanent nature suited to the needs and requirements of a tropical country.Bureau of insular Affairs (1907). \\"Acts of the Philippine Commission, Nos. 1408-1538\\", pg. 248. Government Printing Office, Washington. He received a salary from the Government which paid the cost of plans, etc. Also, he was allowed to engage in private practice, and maintained a separate office during most of his years in Manila. He served until February, 1914, resigning because \\"there seemed to be no further progress to be made under the scuttle policy of the present administration.\\" He was replaced by his assistant, George Corner Fenhagen, as the Consulting Architect of the Philippine government. One of the features of local architecture he adopted generally on his design, even at the high-end Manila Hotel, was the use of Capiz shells for window sash in place of glass. The Capiz shell is a flat sea shell about in diameter. It is trimmed down to squares, which are set in thin strips of wood. They give a soft pearly light, where clear glass would be intolerable on account of the glare. One of the most widespread designs of Parsons is the Gabaldon schoolhouse. These are school buildings constructed in the Philippines between 1907 and 1946 and named after the late assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of Nueva Ecija, who authored the Gabaldon Act which appropriated P1 million for the construction of modern public schools nationwide.http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/65255/restoring-gabaldon- schoolhouses He died on December 17, 1939 at his home in New Haven, Connecticut. ==Works== *Customs Office, Cebu City *Manila Army and Navy Club Building, Manila *Manila Elks Club, Manila *Manila Hotel, Manila *Paco railway station, Manila *Philippine General Hospital *Philippine Normal School *Provincial Capitol (Old) of Laguna Province in Santa Cruz, Laguna *Provincial Capitol (Old) of Nueva Ecija in Cabanatuan City *University Hall of the University of the Philippines Manila *The Mansion House, Baguio *Provincial Capitol (Old) of Capiz Province in Roxas City, Capiz *Casa Gobyerno in Dumaguete built in 1920 demolished in 1935 ==See also== *Architecture of the Philippines ==References== .

Vilozny graduated from the Beit Zvi School for the Performing Arts in 1979. ===Stand-up comedy=== Vilozny was one of the first stand up comedians in Israel who contributed tremendously to the flourishing of the Israeli stand-up scene in the mid-1980s after he founded a stand-up club in Tel Aviv called the \\"Camel Comedy Club\\" which hosted various stand-up shows regularly and from which some of the most popular comedians in Israel nowadays originally emerged.שמואל וילוז'ני Vilozny became fascinated with stand up comedy after he saw a street stand up show for the first time in London during the 1980s. After his return to Israel, Vilozny began performing in various stand-up routines throughout Israel, which were considered innovative at the time and soon thereafter founded the stand-up club. However, after several young prominent and promising comedians emerged in his stand-up club, Vilozny starting to minimize the amount of his performances, and began to focus his career on acting in theater and film. === Theater === Through the years Vilozny played in various plays, and in addition directed several plays as well. The roles he portrayed in the theater include: Sebastian in \\"Twelfth Night\\", Horatio in \\"Hamlet\\", Valère in Molière's \\"The Miser\\", Truffaldino in \\"Servant of Two Masters\\", and more. Vilozny also played in the Library Theater in Ramat Gan, in which he played among others, Jimmy Porter in John Osborne's \\"Look Back in Anger\\" and Mr. Slik in a play of that name. In the Beer Sheva Theatre Vilozny played Oberon in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and Antipholus of Ephesus in \\"The Comedy of Errors\\". By 2003, Vilozny joined the Cameri theater, after being in the Habima theater for nine years. In the Cameri theater Vilozny starred in Neil Simon's \\"Chapter Two\\" and later on performed in the plays \\"Love Letters\\" (מכתבי אהבה), \\"Backstage\\" (אחורי הקלעים), and from July 2006 Vilozny has been starring in the play \\"Yetush BaRosh\\" (יתוש בראש) alongside Limor Goldstein.

He decided eventually to abandon his film career in the early 1990s in order to focus on other occupations, especially theater. In 1983, he starred in his first film which was \\"The Dormitory\\" (הפנימיה) in which he played alongside Alon Abutbul. In 1984 he played in \\"Testimony of Rape \\"(עדות מאונס) alongside Uri Gavriel and Oshik Levy. In 1986 he played in \\"The Great Madness\\" (השגעון הגדול) alongside Anat Waxman, Dov Navon and Sefi Rivlin. During 1987 he starred in \\"Tel Aviv-Berlin\\" and \\"Don't Give a Fuck\\" (לא שם זין) which was based on a book by the same name by Dan Ben-Amotz. In 1992 Vilozny starred in Michal Bat-Adam's film The Deserter's Wife and in 1995 he produced a documentary called \\"Daddy let's go to the Luna Park\\" in which he revealed his complex relationship with his dad who is a Holocaust survivor and the film follows their journey to Auschwitz. Through the years Vilozny also starred in various television programs. In 1997 he starred in the comedy series \\"Tzahal 1\\" (צה\\"ל 1). Later on he hosted the travel program \\"Zman Galil\\" on the Israeli Channel 10. In 2002 Vilozny played in the TV film \\"Two minutes from Paradise\\" (\\"שתי דקות מפרדייז\\") directed by Daniel Syrkin. In 2003 Vilozny starred in the TV series \\"Tzimerim\\" (\\"צימרים\\") in the Israeli channel 1. Two years later Vilozny participated in the second season of the drama series \\"Seize the Sky\\" (לתפוס את השמיים), and also hosted the satirical program \\"Pkakim\\" (פקקים) on the Israeli sports channel === Political activity === Vilozny was the first in Israel who made the transition from the entertainment scene to municipal politics when he was eventually elected as a member of the Council of the Municipality of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. At 1989 Vilozny participated in the municipal elections running as the head of the party \\"Samuel Vilozny-Our City\\" (\\"שמואל וילוז'ני-העיר שלנו\\") but the party received only one seat (his own).http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,720,209,58460,.aspx He was widely considered as a prominent opposition leader against the then-mayor Shlomo Lahat. At the end of his term Vilozny retired from politics, but eventually made a comeback to politics in 1998 when he ran for mayor of Tel Aviv. In the 1998 elections Vilozny's party got two seats in the city council and in the mayoral elections, he ended up in third place, after Ron Huldai and Doron Rubin, with approximately 13.5% of the votes. His party was in the opposition during his term, after which he announced that he would not run again the next municipal elections, and that he was retiring from politics. In the 2003 Knesset elections Vilozny was ranked at the fifth position for the party The Greens. === Personal life === Vilozny is married with four children.תרבות - תיאטרון nrg - ...שמואל וילוז'ני לא דופק חשבוןסגנון - איך היא עושה את זה nrg - ...איך הוא עושה את זה? ==References * Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Beit Zvi School for the Performing Arts alumni Category:Israeli entertainers Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli comedians ","title":"Samuel Vilozny"},{"id":"35963627","text":"Ahmed Nabil Khader (, born 19 January 1986) is an Egyptian fencer.

In Texas, Linn took part in the siege of Bexar, and is listed on the roster of Lt. Col. James C. Neill's Bexar garrison as having been taken prisoner. This possibly occurred during Siege of Bexar and then Linn may have been released. Linn purportedly served in the Alamo as a member of Capt.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Preston, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St John, Preston. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. ==History== The church was built in 1725–26 as a chapel of ease to St John's Church, Preston, and was enlarged in 1799, when it is likely that the transepts were added. The church was encased in stone in 1843. In the following year, St George's became a parish in its own right. In 1848 the chancel, designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe, was added. The nave was raised and remodelled by Garlick, Park and Sykes in 1884–85. A gallery was added in the south transept during the 20th century. ==ArchitectureExterior=== As originally designed, the church was in Georgian style, but subsequent additions and alterations have transformed it into Romanesque style. It is constructed in sandstone ashlar, with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, and a chancel with an apse. At the west end of the south aisle is a three-stage tower incorporating a porch, and at the west end of the church is a small baptistry. All the windows are round-headed, other than a west wheel window in the baptistry, and circular openings in the clerestory. The doorway in the bottom stage of the tower is gabled, the middle stage contains pilasters, a single window, and a corbel table. In the top stage are louvred bell openings and another corbel table. The parapet has a pinnacle at each corner, and a pierced roundel. ===Interior=== Inside the church are six-bay arcades, consisting of pointed arches carried on circular piers. The font is a circular marble tub dated 1865. The organ case was painted by Shrigley and Hunt. On the walls is a scheme of paintings by Carl Almquist of Shrigley and Hunt, executed between 1885 and 1914. The stained glass in the windows was also designed by Almquist. In the church are 19th- century monuments. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1865 by Henry Willis, and opened by the Liverpool organist W. T. Best. Initially sited in the west gallery, it was moved to its present position in the north transept by the same firm in 1883. The organ was rebuilt in 1973 by J. W.

The order, in all essence of the word, were 'Knights Templar' whom continued their operations from their headquarters in Tomar, Santarém Portugal. Contrary to the belief that the Templar Order was renamed and established by King Denis of Portugal, the Templars merely moved backed to their original headquarters in Tomar Castle which was an autonomous zone granted to the Templar Order. Reasons for this move and change of name were to protect the vast assets of the order from repatriation by the Catholic Church. The Templar assets where then transferred over to the Cavaleiros de Cristo. All with the blessing of King Diniz who helped pull off the deal with the Church. The order was secularized in 1789, and dissolved in 1910. It was revived in 1917 within the Portuguese Republic, headed by the President of Portugal, as a decoration in recognition of outstanding services to the state. ==History of the Knights Templar in Portugal== The Templars were founded around 1118 and soon formed commanderies around Europe to support their efforts in the Holy Land, settling in Portugal at least since 1122, in the region of Braga, where the Order received successive donations and where they also bought lands. This occurred only two or three years after their foundation in Jerusalem, and about 7 years before their recognition and confirmation in the Council of Troyes.

Author: Paula Pinto Costa, FLUP/CEPESE (University of Porto) The Templars also received lands donated by D. Theresa in 1126, a few years before Portugal became a fully independent kingdom. Portugal was the first country in Europe where they settled. Gualdim Pais, provincial Master of the Order of the Temple in Portugal, constructed the Convento de Cristo in 1160. According to folklore, he chose the location after drawing lots and receiving a sign to build a new Templar fortress on a hill between the river Fria and Saint Gregory's creek. Traditional local legends and chronicles preach that the choice was for mystical reasons and by divine inspiration, from practices like geomancy by the provincial Grand Master, based on exercises taken from luck and predestination. Reinforcing this magical view is the fact that the lot was part of a small chain of seven elevations (lugar dos sete montes), which became known as the city of seven hills, as the seven hills of Jerusalem, the seven hills of Rome or the seven columns of Constantinople. \\\\- TOMAR DOS TEMPLÁRIOS: A SEDE PORTUGUESA DA ORDEM DOS TEMPLÁRIOS - Ademir Luiz da Silva, Revista Mosaico, v.4, n.1, p.92-103, jan./jun. 2011 - in Portuguese Convento de Cristo\\" in Tomar, central Portugal. The Convento de Cristo is a testament to the Templars' architectural abilities.360° virtual tour of the convent The octagonal church was inspired by the Islamic Dome of the Rock shrine in Jerusalem, used by the Templars as their base of operations. The Dome of the Rock is located on the Temple Mount, where the Temple of Jerusalem stood prior to its destruction in 70 A.D., and the Templars believed the Dome of the Rock was a remnant of the ancient Temple from which their name derives. The order incorporated features of the shrine into their imagery and architecture, including the seals of Grand-Masters. The architecture of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre may have also served as a model. The sepulchre itself stands in an elaborate structure within the rotunda (rotunda - 35 m diameter), surrounded by a group of three columns between four pairs of square piers columns supporting an ornamented, domed roof. It is possible that the 4th-century rotunda's columns were removed from their original location on the façade of the Roman temple. Renovation of the piers exposed evidence that the columns had originally been much higher and that the Crusaders cut them in half for use in the 12th-century rotunda. On 13 July 1190, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, the King of Morocco laid siege to the Templars in Tomar. This test of strength confirmed the Templars' military power and established them as an indispensable presence in the defense of northern Portugal. Pais died in 1195 after ruling for 50 years. ==Birth of the Order== Floor Plan of the Church, Chapter House and Charola After the Templar order's suppression by Pope Clement in 1312, King Denis set about creating a new order for the displaced knights in his realm. He instituted the \\"Christi Militia\\" under the patronage of Saint Benedict in 1317 (some sources say August 14, 1318), and Pope John XXII approved this order by a Papal bull on 14 March 1319, \\"AD EA EX QVIBVIS\\".In Portuguese Antigas Ordens Militares. Ordem de Cristo After four years of negotiations, Pope John XXII passed another bull authorizing Denis to grant the Templar's property to the Order of the Christ in 1323. The knights of the order were committed to vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the king. It is unclear how many Templars continued in the new order; some historians would claim the Order of Christ was essentially the Templars under a new name, while others see it as a mostly original formation. The first Grand Master, Dom Gil Martins, had been a knight of Saint Benedict in the Order of Aviz. The Order of Christ was first seated at Castro Marim, in the Algarve (in the Diocese of Faro). In 1357, the order was moved to the town of Tomar, near Santarém, former seat of the Order of the Knights Templars in Portugal. (Other sources give the movement date 1366 under the sixth Grand Master, Dom Nuno Rodrigues.) ==Henry the Navigator's Command== Henry the Navigator After 1417, by King John I of Portugal's request to the Pope, Prince Henry the Navigator (1417-1460) became the order's Grand Master. Prince Henry was born in 1394, the king's third son. During that time, Duarte I and Afonso V were Kings of Portugal. In 1433, King Duarte I gave the Order \\"Sovereign\\" status not over these territories which already held, but over any future conquests. Pope Calixtus III in 1455 confirmed that Afonso V extended his temporal jurisdiction by conceding the royal prerogative over three episcopal nominations in areas ruled by the Order. In 1460, King Afonso V granted the Knights of Christ a 5 percent levy on all merchandise from the new African lands. Using Order of Christ money, Prince Henry organized the Navigator's school in Sagres, preparing the way for Portuguese supremacy; from this village, the first great wave of expeditions of the Period of Discoveries were launched. After Henry, the grand mastership was held by the royal family. Henry colonised the Azores and Madeira islands -- his aim was to go south beyond Cape Bojador, south of the Canary Islands. During Prince Henry's rule, two Gothic cloisters were built in the Convent of Tomar. Henry was the Duke of Viseu and also member of the Knights of the Garter. Henry's impact on history is great, having arguably sparked the European interest in colonial exploration that would so transform the world for the next four centuries. The cross of the Order adorned Portuguese sails in their travels to India, Brazil and Japan. ==After Henry the Navigator== Prince Henry was succeeded in the governorship of the Order by Prince Ferdinand, son of King Edward I. In 1484, Emanuel, Duke of Beja, became the 11th Governor of the Order. Due to the fact that the discipline of the order was declining, Pope Alexander VI commuted the vow of celibacy to that of conjugal chastity in 1492; in 1496, the brethren were dispensed from celibacy and in 1505, from poverty, but they still continued their responsions (one third of their revenues) to the Order's treasury. (The condition that they should apply the third part of their revenues to the building and support of the Tomar Cloister) and the priests of which he bound to the whole of the three vows. Also in 1501, Pope Julius II mitigated the vow of poverty into the payment of a tax - the meia-anata; for the Order of Christ this tax was three-quarters of their annual revenues. Portuguese caravel, adorned with the Cross of the Order. This was the standard model used by the Portuguese in their voyages of exploration. It could accommodate about 20 sailors. Manuel I of Portugal sought and obtained the title of Grand Master by Pope Leo X's Bull Constante fide (June 30, 1516). King Manuel, João's successor, sent Vasco da Gama (a member of the Order of Christ) to sail around the African cape to India. He set sail in 1497 and reached Calicut. By the end of king Manuel's reign, the order possessed 454 commanderies in Portugal, Africa and the Indies. Manuel also made extensive additions to the Order's headquarters in Tomar. Manuel ordered that the church of Tomar be expanded westwards, spreading beyond the castle limits and opening up the Charola to add on to it a magnificent nave which housed the choir and the sacristy, becoming known as the chapter house. The order also began its step-by-step transformation from monastic to secular during Manuel's reign. At the end of this process, the order had taken the form of a royal institution. The son of Manuel did not automatically obtain the succession right for ruling the order, and got an approval by Bull of Pope Adrian VI: Eximiae devotionis (April 14, 1523). After thirty years, John III obtained \\"Perpetual Administration\\" of all the Portuguese Military Orders including the Order of Christ, and of course the Grand Mastership of the Order passed to the Crown by Pope Julius III's Bull, issued in Rome in 1551. For the government of these orders in the king's name, John III instituted a special council named \\"Mesa das Ordens\\". ===John III and Fra António=== There are some scholars who say that in 1522 the Order was divided into two branches - a religious one under the Pope, and a civil one under the king, as they remain today - however, there is a lack of evidence supporting this. In 1523, John III formed a chapter of the Order giving Fra António (also known as Antonius of Lisbon) a Spanish-born Jerome friar, the authority and responsibility to reform the Order. The new statutes were approved in 1529 by the Friars. The Grand Prior was removed from office and all the priests and religious of the Order were required to resume convent life at Tomar, and to wear the habit and cross of the Order. Several religious friars were persuaded to abandon the Order and others were expelled. António of Lisbon obtained the position of Prior. The violation of the tombs of the Templar Masters and the destruction and burning of documents of the Order are attributed to him. Years later, António was also charged with forcibly imposing the dictates of the Council of Trent on the Order of Christ, and later, for ordering two autos-da-fé, the first and only ones held in Tomar (involving four people executed and several penanced, especially New Christians, and allegedly the burning of papers and books as well). The Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536 after the king sent a diplomatic mission to the Holy See led by an ally and friend of Anthony, Baltazar de Faria, who after his death, would be buried in the Convent of Christ in Tomar by Fra António himself. In 1567, António persuaded pope Pius V to give him control of all the convents of the order. More than eighty years before the publication of the first Rosicrucian manifesto, around 1530, a short time before the reform of the Order and the expulsion of several friars, the cross and the rose were associated in the Convent of the Order of Christ. Three bocetes are on the abóboda (vault) of the interior chamber, which is thought to have been the initiation room because of its initial seven steps, seven carved rose-crosses, and a rosette depicting a circular sun on the vault, and its own underground small chamber or tomb of initiation at the end. In some of them, the rose flower can clearly be seen at the center of the cross.Macedo, António de (2000), Instruções Iniciáticas – Ensaios Espirituais, 2nd edition, Hughin Editores, Lisbon, , p.55Gandra, J. Manuel (1998), Portugal Misterioso (Os Templários), Lisbon, pp. 348–349 ===Counterreform by Sebastian=== King Sebastian tried to reverse the reform of brother Antonius of Lisbon in 1574. When Antonius persuaded the pope Pius V to give him the control of all convents of the order in 1567, King Sebastian protested and obtained confirmation of his post as Grand Master. As a result, the religious members of the Order were separated into lay and military membership. ===Philippine Reforms=== Between 1580 and 1640 there was another attempt to reform the order. The new statutes were enacted by the general chapter at Tomar 1619 and were promulgated by Philip III of Portugal in 1627. The conditions for admission to the order were noble birth and either two years' service in Africa or three years with the fleet. ==Secularization of the Order== The Convento de Cristo's famous Manuel I Chapter window by Diogo de Arruda (around 1510) Pope Pius VI (1789) and Queen Mary I made the last attempt to reform the order. This reform made the convent of Tomar once again the headquarters of the whole order. The sovereign still remained Grand Master, but instead of the conventual prior there was a grand prior of the Order. In 1789 the Portuguese Order lost its religious character, being secularised by Queen Mary. Since 1789, the members consisted (besides the Grand Master and Great Commander) of six Knights of the Grand Cross, four hundred and fifty Commanders, and an unlimited number of Knights. Foreigners were exempt from the rules, but, at the same time, were excluded from the participation in the revenues of the Order. Only Catholics of noble descent could be admitted to the Order. The Order of Christ also survived in Brazil until the end of the Monarchic period in 1889. In 1834 when the civil government of Portugal became anti-Catholic, after the defeat of King Miguel in the Civil War, under the constitutional monarchy the order lost its properties. The ancient Military Orders were transformed by the liberal constitution and subsequent legislation into mere Orders of Merit. The privileges which once had been an essential part of the membership of the old military orders were also ceased. In 1910, when Portuguese monarchy ended, the Republic of Portugal abolished all the Orders except the Order of the Tower and Sword. However, in 1917, at the end of the Great War, some of these Orders were re-established as mere Orders of Merit to reward outstanding services to the state, the office of Grand Master belonging to the Head of State - the President of the Republic. The Military Order of Christ, together with the other Portuguese Orders of Merit, had its Statutes revised in several occasions, during the First Republic (1910-1926), then in 1962, and again in 1986. The order is currently governed by a Chancellor and a Council of eight members, appointed by the President of the Republic, to assist him as Grand Master in all matters concerning the administration of the Order. The Order, despite its name, can be conferred on civilians and on military, Portuguese and foreigners, for outstanding services to the Republic, in parliament, in the government, in the diplomatic service, in the Courts of Justice, on public authorities or on the Civil Service. == See also == *Order of Christ (Portugal) *Order of Christ (Brazil) *Supreme Order of Christ == References == Category:1318 establishments in Europe Category:Catholic orders and societies Category:Maritime history of Portugal Category:Reconquista Category:14th- century establishments in Portugal ","title":"History of the Order of Christ"},{"id":"35963808","text":"Lodna Area is one of the 12 operational areas of BCCL located in Dhanbad Sadar subdivision of Dhanbad district in the state of Jharkhand, India. ==History== The Bhowra Area was earlier merged with Lodna Area. ==GeographyLocation=== The Lodna Area office is located at .

The backup-to-disk technology is often supplemented by tape drives for data archival or replication to another facility for disaster recovery. Additionally, backup-to-disk has several advantages over traditional tape backup for both technical and business reasons explained later in this article. With continued improvements in storage devices to provide faster access and higher storage capacity, a prime consideration for backup and restore operations, backup-to-disk will become more prominent in organizations. == Technical Advantanges == There are technical advantages to backup-to-disk technology. One of the main advantages is the speed at which backups can be performed to the disk appliance. Backing up data to a backup-to-disk technology can be up to four times faster than traditional SCSI tape devices. While the new Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) connected tape drives are faster than the original tape drives, the disk appliance is still faster than most tape technologies. These faster backup times lead to shorter backup windows allowing the technology to backup the data while in a smaller amount of time thus increasing the window for processing which is also a benefit for the business. Another advantage that backup-to-disk offers is data de-duplication and compression. The disk appliances offer either de-duplication at the source or at the destination. The de-duplication at the destination is faster and requires less performance overhead on the source host. The de-duplication requires less disk space on the disk appliance as it stores only one copy of the possible multiple copies of one file on the network. Many of the backup-to-disk technologies advertise up to 15 to 1 compression ratios. This also allows the information technology department to store more data on less disk space. With de-duplication a disk appliance with 5 terabytes of raw disk space can store as much as 30 terabytes of compressed and de-duplicated data. == Business Advantages Disaster Recovery=== The most important advantage that backup-to-disk provides for the business, and for the technology department, is faster recovery of the data. Most businesses today have several terabytes of data that the business must be able to retain in the event of a disaster. This disaster can be as simple as server hardware failures to as severe as a regional disaster, such as a natural disaster. For the localized disaster the disk appliance allows the technology department to hold one or two weeks of backups, depending on the size of the disk appliance and the amount of data being backup, which allows for very quick recovery. ===Business Continuity=== Preparation for disaster requires the creation of an organizational Business Continuity Plan (BCP). The BCP describes the guidelines for system continuity and recoverability. Disk based back-ups facilitate rapid system recovery. A backup-to-disk system can replicate data backups to a device at another location. This can be beneficial if the organization has designated the location as the recovery site. Backup- to-disk technology can greatly benefit an organization in continuing to do business if a disaster damages facilities and technology. == Products == There are several Disk Backup solutions on the market today. Below are a few of the industry leading devices. ===Dell EMC=== Dell EMC offers two disk backup devices. The Data Domain device, which EMC acquired from Data Domain in 2009. The Data Domain device de-duplicates the data at the destination, which reduces the overhead on the host. With throughput up to 68 TB/hour, Data Domain systems make it possible to complete more backups in less time and provide faster, more reliable restores. The Data Domain Operating System (DD OS) is the intelligence behind Data Domain systems that makes them the industry’s most reliable and cloud-enabled protection storage. The second Dell EMC offering is Avamar: this unit de-duplicates data at the source via an agent on the host which offers savings on bandwidth utilization during backup. Both of these units offer site-to-site replication. ===HPE=== Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE) offers data storage backup with its HPE StoreOnce portfolio. HPE StoreOnce can be offered as a virtual storage appliance (VSA) or a disk based hardware appliance. The StoreOnce VSA is licensed at 4 TB, 10 TB and 50 TB capacity points and can be deployed on any x86 Industry Standard Server with certain specification requirements. The disk based StoreOnce Backup appliances have six models ranging from a StoreOnce 3100 (5.5TB usable) to a StoreOnce 6500 (1.7PB usable).http://www8.hp.com/h20195/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA4-3329ENW&cc;=us&lc;=en> HPE StoreOnce with HPE StoreOnce Catalyst is the only federated deduplication solution, and it provides disk-based backup for IT environments, from the smallest remote sites to the largest enterprises. You can reduce the amount of space needed to store backup data by 95% and choose between powerful dedicated appliances for larger offices and data centers, and flexible virtual appliances for smaller and remote offices. http://www8.hp.com/h20195/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA4-3329ENW&cc;=us&lc;=en ===Quantum=== Quantum offers several models for disk backup solutions. The DXi-V series is an entry-level unit that stores from 1-2TB of data. The midrange level units are the DXi4000 and DXI6000series, while the enterprise level unit is the DXi8500. All of the offerings from Quantum have de- duplication, compression, and remote site replication. ===Rdiff-backup=== Rdiff-backup is an open source product that provides reverse-delta disk-to- disk backups. ===Rsync-incremental=== Rsync-incremental is not a product per se but rather a technique using the open source program rsync with the—link- dest parameter. This functionality is very similar to Time Machine on macOS. ===Time Machine=== On macOS, Time Machine provides a disk-to-disk backup solution using reverse-deltas. ==See also== * Backup * Disk-to-disk * Disk-to- disk-to-tape * Disk storage ==References== 10.Jump up ^ HP Storage Product Marketing. \\"HP StoreOnce Backup\\".

It has also been covered by other artists, including Tom Rush and Harry Belafonte. The opening line inspired George Harrison to write the No. 1 Beatles' song \\"Something\\". According to James Taylor's stage banter at The Star in Frisco July 31, 2017, this was the song he played for Paul McCartney and George Harrison as an audition before signing with Apple Records. ==James Taylor version== \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" is a romantic song. Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau regards the song as being about \\"transcendence of a sort.\\" Taylor plays the song accompanied only by acoustic guitar. Allmusic critic Linsday Planer regards \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" as one of the \\"notable inclusions\\" on the James Taylor album. Fellow Allmusic critic David R. Adler described it as \\"one of Taylor's finest melodies\\". Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Coleman agrees that it is a \\"highlight\\" of James Taylor, describing the song as \\"winsome\\" and predicting the path Taylor would take in future recordings. Taylor biographer Timothy White describes it as being \\"unquestionably Taylor's finest performance\\" on James Taylor. White described it as \\"spare in presentation\\" and \\"poignant on its own elegant terms.\\" Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau believes that the spare performance and Taylor's \\"restrained delivery\\" add to the song's power, as Taylor \\"lets the melody, lyric, guitar, and voice speak for themselves.\\" Martin Charles Strong describes it as being a \\"memorable original\\" and one that \\"marked Taylor out as a kind of male Joni Mitchell, if not quite as adventurous.\\" Taylor included \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" on his 1976 Greatest Hits but, as with \\"Carolina in My Mind,\\" also from James Taylor, he had to re-record the song due to rights issues. It was also included on the 2003 compilation album The Best of James Taylor. A live version was included on Taylor's and Carole King's live album Live at the Troubadour. A solo live version leads off Taylor's album One Man Band. ==Inspiration for \\"Something\\"== George Harrison liked \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" so much that he used the beginning as the first line of his 1969 song \\"Something\\" from the Beatles album Abbey Road, which was also released as a single and reached No. 1. Early in the development of \\"Something,\\" Harrison had expanded the opening of this song to \\"Something in the way she moves / Attracts me like a pomegranate,\\" using the word \\"pomegranate\\" simply as a place-holder until better words could be found. Taylor has stated that \\"I never thought for a second that George intended to do that. I don't think he intentionally ripped anything off, and all music is borrowed from other music. So completely I let it pass.\\" Taylor also acknowledged that the ending of \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" was taken from the Beatles' song \\"I Feel Fine\\" and so \\"what goes around comes around.\\" ==Cover versions== Tom Rush covered \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" on his 1968 album The Circle Game. Taylor had played the song for Rush when he visited the Elektra Records offices for an audition in 1967. Rush's version was released as a single and become popular on New England radio stations. Crawdaddy! reviewed the song as being the best song on The Circle Game, saying that it \\"flows beautifully with Bruce Langhorne's country stylings pushing it through,\\" also acknowledging that \\"Rush's brand of vocalizing fits perfectly\\" because \\"he can never get excited about anything.\\" Country artist Bobbie Gentry recorded a version titled “Something In the Way He Moves” for her 1970 album Fancy. Iain Matthews and his band Matthews' Southern Comfort recorded a version of \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" for his 1970 album Second Spring. Harry Belafonte covered the song as the opening track of his 1971 album The Warm Touch. He also released it as a single. Billboard regarded \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" as one of the \\"standout\\" tracks on The Warm Touch. Billboard also called the melody \\"beautiful\\" and stated that Belafonte gives the song \\"his own unique treatment.\\" Mitchel Forman recorded an acoustic piano version of \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" for the 2001 multi-artist album Sketches of James: Selection from the James Taylor Songbook. ==References== Category:James Taylor songs Category:Songs written by James Taylor Category:1968 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Peter Asher Category:Harry Belafonte songs Category:Elektra Records singles Category:RCA Victor singles Category:1968 singles Category:1971 singles ","title":"Something in the Way She Moves"},{"id":"35964088","text":"Coat of arms of János Pénzes János Pénzes (; born 10 August 1943 in Bajmok, Kingdom of Hungary) is the Hungarian- born Roman Catholic Emeritus Bishop of Subotica between 1989 and 2020.

Each valve has an umbo or knoblike protuberance from which 20 to 30 shallow ridges radiate to the margin at the other side of the shell. The left valve is usually uppermost as it lies on the seabed and is some shade of red intermixed with white streaks. The annual growth rings can be seen and there is concentric sculpturing parallel to the margin, often in a different shade of pink. The lower valve is either a paler shade of pink or dull white. There is a large auricle or flap on one side of the umbo. When the animal is feeding, it holds the valves apart and the mantle becomes visible, fringed with short tentacles and with a ring of tiny eyes near the margin of each valve. The pink scallop can be distinguished from its close relative the spiny scallop (Chlamys hastata) by the valves being rather more rounded and by the lack of spines on the ribs which gives it a smooth texture. The glossy white interior of the shell does not have the purplish markings that are sometimes present in the spiny scallop. ==Distribution== The pink scallop is found on the Pacific Coast of North America at depths down to about . Its range extends from Alaska to San Diego, California but it is more common in the northern half of this range. It is also found in Kamchatka, the Sea of Okhotsk and Japan. It is found on rocks or on sandy or muddy sea beds. ==Ecology== The pink scallop usually has a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge, usually the orange Myxilla incrustans, which grows on its left valve. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop, and may deter predators from attacking it. The sponge also makes it harder for a starfish to pull open the scallop with its tube feet, because it makes manipulating the shell more difficult. The sponge benefits from not being submerged by sediment in turbid conditions. In the laboratory, a study showed that when the sediment in seawater tanks was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died, whereas those on living shells flourished. When a starfish such as the mottled star (Evasterias troscheli) approaches, the scallop \\"smells\\" its presence with chemoreceptors at the tips of its tentacles. It then takes evasive action, repeatedly clapping its valves together and swimming away, margin first. If a starfish succeeds in touching a sponge growing on the shell, it often turns away, apparently repelled by this distasteful coating. ==NotesReferences== rubida Category:Bivalves described in 1845 Category:Fauna of Alaska ","title":"Chlamys rubida"},{"id":"35964158","text":"Gergő Máté (born 13 July 1990 in Kecskemét) is a Hungarian football player who currently plays for Kecskeméti TE. == References == *HLSZ *MLSZ *Kecskemét official website Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kecskemét Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Kecskeméti LC players ","title":"Gergő Máté"},{"id":"35964184","text":"Parliament House () in Wellington is the main building of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings. It contains the debating chamber, speaker's office, visitors' centre, and committee rooms. It was built between 1914 and 1922, replacing an earlier building that burned down in 1907. Parliament started using the yet to be completed building from 1918. Parliament House was extensively earthquake strengthened and refurbished between 1991 and 1995. It is open for visitors almost every day of the year, and is one of Wellington's major visitor attractions. Parliament House is a Category I heritage building registered by Heritage New Zealand. ==Architecture== Parliament House was designed in an Edwardian neoclassical style. It was deliberately designed to display New Zealand materials; the building is faced with Takaka marble, with a base course of Coromandel granite. Major architectural features of the building exterior include marble columns lining the front and a long set of steps leading to the main entrance. ==History== On 11 December 1907, the original Parliament House burned to the ground, along with all other parliament buildings except the library. The Liberal Government took this as an opportunity to completely redesign the seat of government, with unified buildings in permanent materials for the politicians and the supporting administration. A museum was allowed for and the public servants would move across from the Old Government Buildings on Lambton Quay. Government House (left) and Parliament House (right), A competition to find a replacement design was announced by Prime Minister Joseph Ward in February 1911 and 33 designs were entered. The winning design, by government architect John Campbell, was selected by Colonel Vernon, former government architect for New South Wales. As another of Campbell's entries won fourth place, the actual design is a combination of both entries. The design was divided into two stages. The first half, a Neoclassical building, contained both chambers and the second half Bellamy's and a new Gothic Revival library to replace the existing one. Despite cost concerns, Prime Minister William Massey let construction of the first stage begin in 1914, but without much of the roof ornamentation or the roof domes. The outbreak of World War I created labour and material shortages that made construction difficult, and the choice of Takaka marble added a logistical challenge to the building process. Chosen on account of its strength and polished finish, over 5000 tonnes would be utilised for build materials.https://contractormag.co.nz/contractor/takaka- hill/ By 1917 the top floor had been added and the grounds had been levelled, but everything was behind schedule. Although the building was unfinished, MPs moved into it in 1918 to get out of the old, cramped Government House (which housed the governor). In 1922, the first stage was completed; the second stage was never built. During the construction of the building, in 1915, a statue of Richard Seddon (a former prime minister who died in office in 1906) was erected east of the main entrance steps. It was designed by Sir Thomas Brock of England. ===1990s restoration and strengthening=== Restoration of Parliament House, 31 August 1992 Plaque commemorating the re-opening of Parliament House by the Queen on 2 November 1995. During the 1980s, there were discussions about earthquake risk, and Parliament House had started to look shabby. There was even discussion about demolishing it. In 1989, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now known as Heritage New Zealand) assigned the highest heritage rating to the building – Category I. This helped convince the decision makers to have the building strengthened and renovated, and what was up to then New Zealand's largest heritage building conservation project began. In 1991, members moved across to Bowen House, where a temporary debating chamber had been built. Base isolation was installed, and at its peak, 400 workers were on site plus an additional 300 people were working offsite on the project. The renovated building was officially opened in November 1995 by Queen Elizabeth II, queen of New Zealand, after its comprehensive strengthening and refurbishment. The parliamentarians had their first session in the renovated building in February 1996. The intention of the Liberal Government had been for the design to be implemented in stages, eventually resulting in a coherent architectural setting. Instead, as Heritage New Zealand remarks, the setting that has been achieved \\"has little aesthetic or architectural coherence\\", especially through the construction of the Beehive instead of completion of Parliament House. ==Visiting and tours== Parliament is open to the public every day apart from some key public holidays; entry is subject to security screening. Free one-hour tours are offered between 10 am and 4 pm on the full hour. Access to the public galleries above the debating chamber is not part of the tour, is only possible on days the house is sitting, and a dress code applies. Parliament House has a visitor centre, with opening hours slightly longer than the times during which tours are offered. ==Photo gallery== File:Seddon Statue, Wellington, New Zealand (94).JPGStatue of Richard Seddon (1845–1906) File:Parliament House, Wellington, New Zealand (81).JPGMain entrance File:Parliament House, Wellington, New Zealand (84).JPGRoyal coat of arms above entrance File:Parliament House, Wellington, New Zealand (86).JPGColumns lining the front facade File:Parliament House, Wellington, New Zealand (78).JPGView of the north end File:BackofNZParliament.JPGWest end (rear entrance) ==References *Virtual tour of the Parliament Buildings *Parliament House entry at Heritage New Zealand Category:Buildings and structures in Wellington City Category:Government buildings completed in 1922 Category:NZHPT Category I listings in the Wellington Region Category:Politics of New Zealand Category:Tourist attractions in Wellington City Category:1920s architecture in New Zealand Category:Neoclassical architecture in New Zealand Category:John Campbell (architect) buildings ","title":"Parliament House, Wellington"},{"id":"35964196","text":"Meyer R.

He previously played for Sandnes Ulf and Red Bull Salzburg, and became the youngest player that has ever played in the Norwegian top league when he made his first-team debut in 2012 (the record has since been broken by Martin Ødegaard). Bytyqi, who is of Albanian descent, has represented Norway at youth international level and Kosovo at a senior international level. == Career == Bytyqi was born in Belgium to Kosovar immigrants, but moved to Norway at the age of 2. He did not play football before he was 10 years old, when he started to play for Lura IL before he moved to Sandnes Ulf ahead of the 2010 season. In 2011, he played several matches for Sandnes Ulf's reserve team in the Third Division. He also trained with the first team but was ineligible for play in the First Division because of his young age. He gave an impressive performance for Norway U15 in September 2011, partly by scoring the winning goal in one of the matches, and joined Newcastle United on a week-long trial in October 2011. His agent, Jim Solbakken, stated that despite the interest from bigger clubs, it would be best for Bytyqi's development to stay at Sandnes Ulf. Bytyqi signed a professional one-year contract with Sandnes Ulf in January 2012, and head coach Asle Andersen said that he had never seen such a talented striker, and that he would get his chance in Tippeligaen, following Sandnes Ulf' promotion to the top league. Bytyqi played for Sandnes Ulf during their pre-season, and he also scored a goal in the 6–0 win against Randaberg. After a very solid game for Norway U16 in April 2012, Sandnes Ulf's Director Tom Rune Espedal confirmed interest from English, German and Dutch clubs, but that no club had yet made an offer for Bytyqi, and that they most likely would sell the talented player during the summer. Bytyqi stated that his big dream was to play professionally abroad, but that he wouldn't leave Norway without his family. When Sandnes Ulf's forwards Tommy Høiland, Vetle Myhre and Gilles Mbang Ondo was out with injury, Bytyqi was included in the squad for the match against Haugesund on 28 May 2012, and made his debut for Sandnes Ulf when he came on as a substitute in the 77th minute. This made him the youngest player in the top league of Norway, aged 15 years, 261 days, beating Sverre Økland's (aged 16 years and 1 day) old record from 2009. The record was broken on 13 April 2015, when Martin Ødegaard made his debut for Strømsgodset aged 15 years and 118 days. In August 2012, Bytyqi was called up for the Norwegian U16-team, a decision that neither Sandnes Ulf or the player was happy about, as Bytyqi could have played the league-game against Lillestrøm and even made his first appearance in the starting line-up due to injuries. Bytyqi signed a three-year contract with Red Bull Salzburg on 23 August 2012, and joined Norwegians Valon Berisha and Håvard Nielsen in the clubs first-team squad in January 2013.

The house was named for the family of James \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Robinson, a free African American, who built the house. The Robinson family, descendants of Gentleman Jim, owned and occupied the house and a large portion of the land around it from the 1840s until 1936. The National Park Service acquired this parcel as part of their effort to commemorate two major battles of the American Civil War, the First and Second battles of Bull Run (also known as First and Second Manassas) which occurred about one year apart. Both battles were Confederate victories. However, Robinson House managed to survive virtually unscathed. ==Pre-Civil War== The homestead was constructed in the 1840s by James \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Robinson, an African American, on land he purchased from local planter John Lee. James would become the third richest African American in the area.Biography of James Robinson http://www.nps.gov/mana/forteachers/upload/Res1_JamesRobinsonBio.pdf As the son of Landon Carter, Jr. and a free African American woman, James received an education in his youth. In honor of the private tutor who taught him and the Carters' daughters Bladen and Tasco, he took the last name of his tutor as his own. Although he was born free, he was bound out for a period of time under the pretense of learning a trade. In fact, he worked as a field laborer during this time. After serving his time, he went to work for Thomas Hampton in Brentsville, Virginia, as a waiter in his tavern. He established a good relationship with Hampton, as indicated by the numerous formal contracts they entered into over a ten-year span. During this period, he used his earnings to add to his land holdings. In 1847, John Lee died. As was common throughout the United States at that time, Lee owned land and slaves, including Jim's wife and children. Upon his death, those family members who were still on his plantation were willed to Jim, who took them to live with him in his new home. Around the same time Jim established his own roadhouse on the Warrenton Turnpike, the main road from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, Virginia, the capital of what would become the Confederacy. This was a prime location that would make him one of the wealthiest African Americans in the Manassas area, but would also bring the Civil War right into his front yard. ==Civil WarFirst Battle of Bull Run=== First Battle of Bull Run Map7 Two major battles of the Civil War were waged around the Robinson House. During the First Battle of Bull Run the map to the right shows the troops of two brigadier generals engaging in a pitched battle, that resulted in a total rout of the Union Forces, under the command of Erasmus Keyes. The Confederate forces held their ground, under the command of Thomas J. Jackson, so well that from then on he would be known as Stonewall Jackson. His forces held the line on one side of the Robinson House as the Union troops attempted to overcome their stiff opposition. Before the fighting began Gentleman Jim took his family to a neighbor's home where he hoped they would be safe. After securing the house Jim attempted to reunite with his family, but was caught in the crossfire of the battle and had to take shelter under a bridge over Young's Branch of the Bull Run River until hostilities ceased. That first battle left thousands of bodies littering the fields throughout Manassas. For days after the fighting was over, the Robinsons buried many in unmarked graves. Well into the 20th century family members reported that they were still digging up the bones of some of these soldiers. The first battle was over in a matter of a few days. Many thought that the Civil War would be decided in one, winner take all battle. But this was not to be the case. Confederate troops won the First Battle of Manassas, with federal troops retreating back to Washington, D.C., but the Civil War continued. ===Second Battle of Bull Run=== The Second Battle of Bull Run lasted for about a week and also resulted in a Confederate victory. Again, Federal troops retreated back to Washington and the Confederates did not pursue. The casualties on both sides were even higher following this second battle. Pope and McClellan were strategically out maneuvered by Lee and Jackson, despite the fact that they had more troops. Again the battle raged around Robinson House. Following the destruction of Henry House during the First Battle of Bull Run, Robinson House was one of the most strategically located buildings on the battlefield. Because of this it was used as a Union hospital and planning station. In sworn testimony before the Southern Claims Commission, Gentleman Jim described how following the battle troops raided his farm in search of food and supplies, causing more than $2,000 in damages. ==Post Civil WarSouthern Claims Commission=== On February 2, 1872, James Robinson presented his case to the Southern Claims Commission. This commission was set up to handle damage claims of property owners who were loyal to the Union. Jim's testimony, as well as that of the witnesses called in regarding his case, offered up valuable insights into the military maneuvers of the Union and Confederate troops. In the claim Jim and his neighbors detail how Union troops took food, live stock, fence posts, and goods from his house. The house was also used as a field hospital for the wounded and dying, during the 2nd Battle of Bull Run. As one reporter put it, > The Robinson House is used as a Yankee hospital. In a visit there this > morning, I found 100 of them [Yankees] packed in the rooms as thick as > sardines. ... The wounds of the majority were undressed, the blood had dried > upon their persons and garments, and altogether there (sic.) the most > horrible set of beings it has been my lot to encounter. ===After the death of Gentleman Jim=== Following the death of Gentleman Jim in 1875 his son Alfred took over as head of the household. According to available census records, he moved in with his mother and other family members as the head of the Robinson clan, until his death in 1904. The house remained in the family up until 1936 when it was sold to the National Park Service (NPS). This site of the house the surrounding property makes up an important part of the battlefield park today. ===Manassas Battlefield Park=== Robinson House was one of the few houses on the battlefield that was occupied during the 19th and 20th centuries. Even before the First Battle of Bull Run some of the other homes in the area, such as the Carter mansion at Pittsylvania, had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair. Henry House was completely demolished during the First Battle of Bull Run, killing its resident, Judith Carter Henry, in the process. Robinson House managed to remain intact in spite of its location in the center of heavy gunfire and artillery barrages. Although the house was able to survive the Civil War, it was destroyed by arsonists in 1993. The perpetrators were never caught, but there was evidence that it was a hate crime. Apparently, just a few weeks prior to the destruction of the house someone had vandalized the structure with graffiti.'Gentleman Jim' has a Unique Spot in History http://www2.insidenova.com/news/2011/jul/21/gentleman- jim-has-unique-spot-history-ar-1185720/ The National Park Service, in accordance with their current guidelines, has no plans to rebuild the structure, but they did conduct an archeological dig on the property, which resulted in the publication of the most significant document on the house and the family that owned and occupied it from pre-Civil War days into the early 20th century. The site of Robinson House is preserved as part of the Manassas National Battlefield Park. ==References * Manassas National Battlefield Park Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia Category:Houses in Prince William County, Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1848 Category:Protected areas of Prince William County, Virginia Category:African-American historic places Category:Manassas National Battlefield Park Category:National Register of Historic Places in Prince William County, Virginia ","title":"Robinson House (Manassas, Virginia)"},{"id":"35964419","text":"The ashy mining bee or grey mining bee, Andrena cineraria, is a European species of the sand bee (Andrena) genus. Its distinctive colouring makes it one of the most easily recognised of the genus. The females are black, with two broad grey hair bands across the thorax. The male is also black although the thorax is entirely covered with grey hairs. The male has a tuft of white hairs on the lower face and white hairs on all femora while the female has white hairs only on the front femora. The female has twelve segments to their antennae and the male has thirteen. The ashy mining bee is common and widespread throughout Europe. ranging from Ireland across central Europe and into Scandinavia. They are common throughout the United Kingdom although less frequent in northern Scotland. Generally docile, they are considered safe around children and pets. The ashy mining bee flies from April until early June, most noticeably during the flowering periods of fruit trees, of which they are an important pollinator. They are also commonly seen hovering just above the ground after mating in spring. Following mating, the male dies and the female starts to build a nest. Each female has her own nest and the ashy mining bee is therefore classified amongst solitary bees. They prefer to nest in tended lawns, flowerbeds, parkland, calcareous grassland, orchards and on the borders of agricultural land. The nest is a simple burrow with several brood cells branching off it. The entrances to the burrows are identifiable by the conical mounds of excavated spoil on the surface. The female fills the brood cells with a mixture of nectar and pollen, and lays one egg in each cell. The larva hatches within a few days, grows quickly and pupates within a few weeks. The adults emerge the following spring after hibernation. The male emerges before the female. The nests are frequently invaded by cleptoparasitic \\"cuckoo bees.\\" ==References * Video Andrena cineraria Category:Andreninae Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Ashy mining bee"},{"id":"35964483","text":"Thirteenth Army or 13th Army may refer to: *Thirteenth Army (Japan) *Japanese Thirteenth Area Army *13th Army (Russian Empire), unit in World War I *13th Army (RSFSR), a unit in the Russian Civil War *13th Army (Soviet Union) *13th Air Army, Soviet Union ","title":"Thirteenth Army"},{"id":"35964491","text":"IRIC may refer to: *Institut de recherche en immunologie et en cancérologie de l’Université de Montréal *International Relations Institute of Cameroon ","title":"IRIC"},{"id":"35964510","text":"Bauhinia galpinii is a species of shrub in the family Fabaceae.

It presents syncretic features both pre-Hispanic and Christian. The dance has strong visual markers of its pre-Hispanic roots with feathered regalia, indigenous dance steps and indigenous instruments such as drums. However, the name Concheros comes from a type of lute made with an armadillo shell, showing Spanish influence. The dance in its current form was the adaptation of the old “mitote” dance to Catholicism as a means of preserving some aspects of indigenous rite. It remained a purely religious ceremony until the mid 20th century when political and social changes in Mexico also gave it cultural significance as a folk dance. Since the later 20th century, a sub group of the dance called Mexicas has emerged with the aim of eliminating the European influence, often with political aims. This form of the dance migrated to the United States in the mid-1970s and can be seen in states such as California in Mexican American communities. Although the dance tradition has been known (especially in the U.S.) as \\"Aztec\\" or \\"Mexica,\\" it is neither. The roots of the conchero dances (and thus the roots of the modern \\"Mexica\\" dances tradition is deeply rooted in the Chichimeca cultures of the north. The Otomi, Jonaz, Chichimeca, Caxcan, and other tribes never conquered by the Mexica, are the true roots of the Danza Conchera. Whereas the Mexi'ca rituals were based on solar concepts and values, the Chichimeca were rooted in selenic and stellar cosmology. Worship and honoring of family and cultural ancestors was a large part of the Chichimeca tradition. That is why today's conchero rituals always start at midnight, and include rituals to call \\"down\\" the spirits of the ancestors to bring purity for the following day's battle (dance ritual). ==History== Performance in the Zocalo in Mexico City While “Concheros” is the oldest and most common name for the dance as performed today, other names are used such as Huehuenches, Chichimecas, Aztecas and Mexicas. Some are regional and some are names that have been used more recently to mark how the dance has evolved. The dance emerged shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. It is based on the old “mitote” dance, but modified to include Catholic symbolism as a means of preserving ancient ritual. While the Spanish tried to eliminate as much indigenous culture as possible, total eradication was not possible. In the case of dance, that which could not be suppressed was adapted to Christianity to facilitate the evangelization process. Early dances often had a pre Hispanic idol buried or otherwise hidden. The dance's origin has been ascribed to the Bajío region, Querétaro and even Tlaxcala, all on the outer edges of the former Aztec Empire. One theory states that it originated as part of a large number of dance innovations, such as re enactments of the Conquest or the battle that subdued the Otomis and Chichimecas near what is now the city of Querétaro . The dance adopted Spanish military terms for its lead dancers such as captain and lieutenant and was originally done by lords and princes who would perform in their finery. This tradition of performing the dance in as fantastic a costume as possible continues to this day. Since then, the dance has been passed down generations. By the 19th century, dancers performed in close collaboration with Catholic confraternities with limited membership often by lineage, which is still the case in many small towns and villages. Sometime before the end of the 19th century, migrant workers brought the dance to Mexico City and other nearby cities. The spread led to several major lineages of Concheros dancers, as different migrants at different times would form groups in the capital. Many of these city Conchers also allow the admittance of those who do not have a family history of the dance, as well as performing more openly and not always on certain special occasions. Despite this, most Concheros groups claim lineage going back centuries. For Mexico City, one of the most important lineages arrived just before the Mexican Revolution, that ascribed to Jesús González originally from San Miguel Allende. Many of city's oldest dance groups trace their lineage to this man and to the original standard, which now is only a few strips of tattered cloth. However, factionalism has always existed among Concheros both in the north and in Mexico City. Not all Concheros accept the González lineage as authentic. Blowing conch shell in Amecameca. The changes that occurred in Mexico during and after the Mexican Revolution spurred changes to the dance which have had repercussions to this day. Socialist governments after the war passed anti-Church policies which included the prohibition of public worship in the 1920s. Ironically, the Concheros, who were originally organized to save vestiges of pre Hispanic ritual after the Conquest, became the most ardent defenders of the Catholic Church during the Cristero War, a reaction against the anti Church policies following the Revolution. One reason for this was that laws against public worship forbade them from dancing and many of their dance sites and shrines were destroyed. Some groups perished and others went into hiding, using the same sites they used to hide from Spanish authorities centuries before. Public worship and dance was permitted again in 1929. Between 1930 and 1950, there were about forty official dance groups with about 4,000 dancers. During this time the population of Mexico grew and the government promoted Mexico's indigenous heritage for both political and economic (tourism) reasons. The number of Concheros grew, especially among the working class in certain major Mexican cities, but it also meant that the dance began to change in meaning from a religious rite to a cultural spectacle, included in the repertoire of Mexican folk dance and even featured in a number of films during Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema. By the 1950s and 1960s, dancers found that they could earn money performing for tourists in places such as Acapulco and Veracruz as well as in government –sponsored folk dance competitions. This has caused a crisis in the identity of the dance which continues to this day, a debate about what is “authentic” and what is not. The change in focus also became evident in regalia, with some groups starting to discard the tunics with attempts to copy Aztec dress as depicted in the codices. The first men to discard shirts for the dance in the 1940s caused great scandal, especially among dance elders. Those who first introduced this regalia began to call the dance “Azteca” and re introduced the use of conch shell trumpets, the huehuetl and teponaztli drums. In some cases, these were mixed with the concha (Spanish inspired lute) and other European instruments and in others replaced them entirely. The goal for these dancers is to get rid of the European aspects of the dance and return to a “purely indigenous” performance. Concheros performing in San Francisco, California The dance, especially the “Azteca” version of it, arrived to the United States in the mid-1970s. Two dancers, Andres Segura and Florencio Yescas were instrumental in creating Conchero/Azteca groups from California to Texas among Mexican American communities. The dance entered the US at a time when many Mexicans and Mexican Americans were taking more militant stances against the status quo, especially after the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre. A number of dance groups decided to banish the Christian aspects of the dance ceremony entirely and elements of “new age” philosophy had influence. These became more of a political force than a religious one, seeing the pre Conquest world as idyllic and the current world after that time as corrupted. Most of these dancers call the dance “Mexica” (mex-shi-ca) or some variant of the word. In Mexico, the dance continues to keep its both its Catholic and indigenous elements although other forms of spirituality have had effect. Although there is conscious efforts among the most traditional Conchero dance groups to not change how the dance is done, there has still been innovation, including influence from the Aztecas version. Until 1992, there was no complete record of the many songs and accompanying music or even the prayers, which have mostly been taught orally. ==Performance== Altar area at Asbaje Park in Tlalpan, Mexico City While the dance contains a number of highly visual markers of its pre Hispanic roots, it is not strictly indigenous. The dance, with its variations, is a multilayered phenomenon with both religious, cultural and political meanings, depending on the people involved. Most in Mexico who participate in dances say that they do it for personal and/or spiritual reasons, and many are those with mundane city jobs during the week looking for something the “transcends” the ordinary. Most dancers do not do so as performance although the dancers generally attract spectators. Concheros do not dance alone but are generally organized into groups with hierarchies. The basic group is called a “mesa” (lit. table). The most traditional of the Conchero groups in Mexico are registered with the Association of Concheros, and generally part of a complex associative network based on interpersonal relationships. Most conchero groups consider themselves as “descendents” of a “dance forefather” who is named in the standard of the mesa. Each mesa has a group of officers such as a captain, alférez, sergeants and soldiers with a special post held by women called malinche. The captain may be a man or a woman but the post is often hereditary and is recognized by other Conchero groups. The captain's house contains an altar with the image of the group's patron saint as well as the group's standard. The captain is in charge of organizing pilgrimages, and other ritual obligations, sometimes even paying for the expenses of the group. Dancers are both individual and group. The standard is held during events by the second lieutenant. Sergeants maintain order during ritual. Malinches are in charge of the censers for the constant ritual cleansing of space. Traditional Conchero dance groups consider their performance as spiritual and therefore do not solicit donations. Those who do are called “chimaleros.” Younger dancer at Asbaje Park When performing at a church, the traditional Concheros will acknowledge the patron saints of the site, when walk in two lines towards the outside atrium or square, fronted by the second lieutenant holding the standard. The officers take a place which becomes the center, surrounded by the other dancers. There is often an inner circle which consists of the leaders, and altar, the drummers and the older members of the group and an outer circle with younger dancers often with males and females alternating. The dance circles is divided into four sections with the lieutenants marking the cardinal directions. Before dancing, the Concheros call on deity and their ancestors, perform ritual cleansing with the aim of bringing the past and present together. One of these songs or praises is a mentioning of the four winds or cardinal directions, linked to the Four Evangelists. The main instruments of Concheros dancers include two pre Hispanic drums called a huehuetl and a teponaztli, conch shell trumpets and conchas, lute instruments made from the shell of an armadillo or other stringed instruments. The drums are generally in the center with various dancers holding the other instruments and with rattles (like the ayoyotes) in their hands and on their legs. The altar is often profusely decorated with flowers, candles, colored paper and many other objects. Carrying standard of mesa or dance group Upon signal, the two circles of dancers move, dancing both as a group and individually. The captain generally stays stationary in the middle. The inner circle with the elders moves more slowly and the outer circle contains younger dancers who generally perform more vibrantly with leaps and other difficult movements. The rhythm increases speed with occasional dancer breaking ranks to dance around the formation. Near the end of the session the speed slows and the captains dance. Most of the basic steps and much of the symbolism are pre Hispanic. The circle's focus is inward often to the group's banner. The dancers are often enveloped in incense smoke. Conchero dancers do not touch each other and most movement is restricted to feet and torsos, leaving hands free to play various musical instruments. Many of the dancers and musicians also sing. Dance sets are interspersed with peregrinations, praying or singing. Azteca or Mexica dancers perform the same dances, but do not play concha lutes, wear costumes which are more “indigenous” and generally dispense with the religious ceremony, especially the Catholic. They generally do not visit churches. These dancers are generally younger with minimal clothing, sometimes only loincloths, made with natural materials. The dances are more flamboyant with leaps and extra steps. There are also women in these groups but fewer. They tend to be more individualistic, often with competition among the Mexica dancers through performance and/or attire. These dancers are considered a subgroup to the tradition and are not recognized by the Association of Concheros. Both groups claim tradition, with the Mexica claiming to “rid” the dance of Spanish elements and “restore” it to its pre Hispanic form. The Mexica are dominant in the Zocalo during the week as a political statement. For the Mexica the symbolism is as important if not more important than the dance itself. ==Uniforms - Atuendo== Conchero headdress at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Clothing can range from completely covered to nearly nude. Dancers dress as lavishly as economy permits. regalia include various elements such as animal parts, painted scenes related to religion, history, war, hunting and agriculture. The most traditional outfits are made from natural elements, but are often mixed with commercial fabrics such as denim. The most traditional Conchero dances wear tunics called naguillas (little skirt) and often a cape. These dancers will also have large quantities of gold and silver colored adornments and headdresses made of dyed ostrich feathers. Azteca or Mexica costumes tend to not wear tunics, instead try to copy Aztec dress as depicted in Mesoamerican codices, sometimes with elements of North American Indian dress. Headdresses tend to be made with pheasant feathers. The two styles of dress are not completely separate, especially in Mexico, where Azteca dress has influenced that of the more traditional Concheros, and vice versa. One other form of vestments is found in San Luis Potosí where the dance is called “Apaches.” Here dancers wear trousers and a brightly colored shirt along with a naguilla covered in sequins and beads. They wear a headdress with colorful feathers and mirrors with calfskin-soled sandals on their feet. A wooden bow is held in the left hand and a gourd rattle is in the right. This style of uniforms has been greatly influenced by popular culture, and Hollywood movies. ==Dance locations== Dancer with mandolin at Amecameca Many Conchero (and Azteca) groups are located in and around Mexico City. But there are many, large and important groups in Querétaro (the birthplace of La Danza Conchera/Chichimeca/Azteca), Guanajuato, Jalisco (especially near Zapopan), Hidalgo, Morelos, Michoacán, Zacatecas, and as far north as Chihuahua. The dance sacred space of Mexico City reflects the older Otomí and Chichimeca space of Querétaro. Sacred sites like \\"La Peña de Bernal, Tequizquiapan, and others, marked out the eight ritual directions of ancestor worship and annual cleansing. Today, because many “Azteca” dancers do not know the deep historical roots of La Danza Conchera in Querétaro and Guanajuato, the four cardinal markers of Conchero time and space are seen from the lens of the dwellers of Mexico City. This is because the dancers favor the loci of Mexico's cultural or historical memory (Imperial and powerful Mexi’ca emperors; vast rich and splendorous colonial monuments; and the golden memories of the 1910 Mexican revolution and its muralists) as well as for religious reasons. Most people first see Conchero dancers in the main square of Mexico City, called the Zocalo. The groups that dance in the Zocalo are usually groups that do not have deep trans-generational roots in La Danza Conchera, or that are dancing for tourists donations. Most mesas dance there only occasionally, generally for political events or historical/civic events linked to Aztec cultural icons. The Zocalo has also been a popular area since the 1990s for learning the dance in a non-ritual situation. It is important because the Zocalo is important to Mexico's political and cultural identity as it marks the historical center of Mexico City and the center of the Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan . Another important site in the city is Tlatelolco, especially on July 15, the day of Saint James. The other most important sites for Conchero dance form a rough cross extending out from the historic center of Mexico City, and include the Villa de Guadalupe in the north (which is Tonantzin), Amecameca in the east, (which is either Tlaloc or Tepeyollotl), Chalma in the south (which is either Tlaoc or Tezcatlihpoca) and Los Remedios in the west (which is Mayahuel). These sites are marked by religious images, the Virgin of Guadalupe, the Christ of Sacromonte, the Christ of Chalma and the Virgin of the Remedies respectively. In large celebrations the movement of the circles can be constrained by neighboring ones. The main pilgrimage to the Virgin of Guadalupe is on 12 December, and it is the most important pilgrimage in Mexico. The annual pilgrimage to Amecameca is on Ash Wednesday. The image of this Christ is kept in a cave, which used to contain an idol of Tlaloc. The image is taken out of the cave during this time and taken to the parish church. Chalma is an important meeting place for the various Conchero mesas, giving the captains a chance to meet and discuss matters of mutual importance. Most mesas have crosses which are placed on the hills around the sanctuary. During the annual pilgrimage, this cross is taken down, repainted and repaired, blessed and returned to its place. The annual pilgrimage here is usually during Holy Week. The Concheros head to the Virgin of the Remedies on September 10 which is located in Naucalpan. This shrine and image is generally linked to La Noche Triste and the eventual defeat of the Aztecs. This small virgin was created in Spain during the \\"reconauista\\" of Spain from the Muslims. It came with Hernan Cortez and was lost on \\"La Noche triste\\" This night is when it is said Cortez cried for his men who dies when the Spanish were forced to evacuate Tenochtitlan. He cried under a Cypress tree(ahuehuete) in Popotla. The image was lost, and decades later, the image here is said to have been found under a maguey plant by an Otomi chief. ==See also== *Danza Mexi'cayotl *Concheras ==References * Category:Dance in Mexico Category:Native American dances ","title":"Concheros"},{"id":"35964573","text":"Twentieth Army or 20th Army may refer to: *Twentieth Army (Japan), a unit of the Imperial Japanese Army *20th Army (Soviet Union) *20th Group Army, People's Liberation Army *20th Guards Army, Soviet Union and Russia *20th Mountain Army (Wehrmacht), a German unit in WWII ","title":"Twentieth Army"},{"id":"35964644","text":"Drishti (from Sanskrit दृष्टि dr̥ṣţi, meaning \\"vision\\" or \\"insight\\") is a multi-platform, open-source volume-exploration and presentation tool.Drishti: a volume exploration and presentation tool Written for visualizing tomography data, electron-microscopy data and the like, it aims to ease understanding of data sets and to assist with conveying that understanding to the research community or to lay persons.

From 1988 to 1990, he was sports editor of the student newspaper, The Aquinas. === Secular journalism experience === Howard joined Forbes Newspapers in Somerville, New Jersey, in July 1992 and served as the primary sportswriter and copy editor of The Metuchen-Edison Review and Highland Park Herald weekly community newspapers. In January 1995, he joined the staff of College Sports magazine in Whitehouse Station, N.J., where he was the primary copy editor of seven professional and college sports yearbooks, and a copy editor and occasional contributor to College Sports monthly magazine. He continued his sportswriting as a feature writer for publications by the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars, Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers and Mesquite Championship Rodeo from 1997-2005. === Catholic press experience === In the summer of 1997, Howard moved to Dallas, Texas, and joined the Dallas Diocese semimonthly newspaper Texas Catholic as a staff writer. He eventually became the news editor and helped found the paper's website and blog. He left Texas Catholic in the spring of 2005 to become editor of The Colorado Catholic Herald. During his time at Texas Catholic he won seven Catholic Press Association (CPA) awards, two Katie awards from the Dallas Press Club, and covered in person the death of Pope John Paul II from Poland and the subsequent papal conclave in Rome in April 2005. Bishop Sheridan hired Howard to restructure operations and redesign the Colorado Springs diocesan newspaper in June 2005. With a staff of four, The Catholic Herald added \\"Colorado\\" to its name and upgraded its frequency from monthly to twice a month (first and third Fridays). In May 2006, the Herald won the CPA's First Place General Excellence award in its circulation category (17,001-40,000 households), the highest award the paper can win. From 2006 until his departure in 2014, the Herald had won two dozen CPA awards. Circulation of the Herald remained steady at nearly 30,000 registered households. During this time, Howard also expanded the Herald's reach by adding a radio studio to the office, and brought the Herald into social media. Among his editorial highlights are covering Pope Benedict XVI's return to Bavaria, Germany, in the fall of 2006 and World Youth Day in Sydney, Australia, in 2008. In 2010, Howard was elected to the Catholic Press Association board of directors for a three-year term, and was re-elected in 2013. In 2012, he was named co-chair of the 2013 Catholic Media Conference, held in Denver June 19–21.http://www.catholicpress.org/events/event_details.asp?id=291342 In November 2014, he became the media director for The Cor Project, a Theology of the Body-focused apostolate founded by Christopher West. === Other === He is the older brother of Dr. Peter Howard, founder of The Catholic Hour apostolate, the Fulton Sheen Society in Aspen, Colorado and is cofounder of the Heroic Families apostolate.http://www.heroicfamilies.com He is also a member of the board of directors for SCOPE Foundation, composed of University of Scranton alumni who raise operational funds for a Catholic elementary school, Santa Luisa, in the poorest section of San Salvador, El Salvador. == References == Category:1969 births Category:American male writers Category:Living people Category:Holy Cross Academy (New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Princeton, New Jersey Category:University of Scranton alumni ","title":"Bill Howard"},{"id":"35964693","text":"is a Japanese field hockey player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics and in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Japan Category:Field hockey players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in field hockey Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games silver medalists for Japan Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Japan Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games ","title":"Chie Kimura"},{"id":"35964698","text":"Sir George Bonham, 2nd Baronet (28 August 1847 - 31 July 1927) was a British diplomat, ambassador to Serbia and Switzerland. ==Career== George Francis Bonham was educated at Eton College and Exeter College, Oxford.

In retrospect, this would prove to be just the first of countless forays by Fischer into various areas of Latin music (with \\"area\\" denoting both genre and geographic region). This particular song was one of the first, and almost certainly the most famous, of all the foreign-born - i.e. non-Brazilian - bossa novas. Its form, though extended (64 mm.), is standard A-A-B-A, with each section consisting of 16 measures instead of eight. ==Alternate versions== With the exception of his contrastingly Cuban-styled composition, \\"Morning\\", \\"Pensativa\\" is by far Fischer's most frequently recorded work; it has been performed by a wide variety of instrumental groupings, ranging from assorted unaccompanied instruments - including piano, guitar and flute - to string orchestras, big bands, and a large assortment of ensemble sizes in between.

In fact, of all the recordings made of this song (including those by the composer), by far the best known is the one arranged by Hubbard and recorded in 1964 by Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers, released in 1964 on the album Free for All. While not surprising, given the All-Star calibre of its participants (the iconic Blakey himself, and his no less iconic Jazz Messengers, in this instance including three premiere soloists - pianist Cedar Walton and Hubbard on trumpet, plus the influential saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter), this state of affairs would prove extremely frustrating to the composer. Speaking to students at an informal clinic hosted by his brother Dirk in October 1998, Fischer explained: > That has been recorded by some jazz players - Freddie Hubbard is one of > them. They don't understand two-beat samba, so they play it like a 4... > [demonstrating], then they change the melody, then they change the chords, > which are going into what we call bebop II-V.

It is used to describe people or domestic animals who went missing in nature for unexplained reasons. People \\"covered by forest\\" were described as not being able to recognize the terrain around them, even if they were on familiar grounds. In other cases they might have walked endlessly through unfamiliar terrain, or were rendered completely paralyzed, unable to move or speak. Unnatural silence devoid of the sounds of nature was also common. People or animals under the influence of the phenomenon were described as becoming either completely invisible to other people, or looking like part of the nature around them, like a rock. In one story a man had been looking for a missing cow for days. When he finally gave up and returned to his work, the first tree stump he struck with his axe transformed back into his cow. The cause behind metsänpeitto was usually credited to maahinens, who were small humanoid creatures living underground (usually translated as \\"gnomes\\"). Some people managed to free themselves from metsänpeitto by their own means, for example by turning their jacket inside out, by switching their shoes to the wrong feet, or by watching world upside down through their own legs. This was because of the idea that everything was topsy-turvy in the lands of the maahinens. Some were released seemingly without reason, others only after being sought after by a shaman. Some were never seen again. One could save cattle from Metsänpeitto with a spell originating in the town of Kuhmo, asking the forest to let them return. Metsänpeitto greatly resembles \\"kamikakushi\\", or \\"spiriting away\\", found in Japanese folklore. ==References== Category:Finnish mythology ","title":"Metsänpeitto"},{"id":"35965111","text":"Shea McAleese (born 7 August 1984) is a New Zealand field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Olympics.

It has higher affinity for this receptor than estradiol. In contrast to ERβ, 3β-androstanediol does not bind to the androgen receptor (AR). 3β-Androstanediol has been reported to also bind to ERα with low nanomolar affinity, with several-fold lower affinity relative to ERβ. It has approximately 3% and 7% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Unlike 3α-androstanediol, 3β-androstanediol does not bind to the GABAA receptor. 3β-Androstanediol may be the primary endogenous ligand of ERβ in the prostate gland, and as a result of activation of the ERβ, 3β-androstanediol has antiproliferative effects against prostate cancer cells. Through the ERβ, 3β-androstanediol positively regulates oxytocin neurons and signaling in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, and has been found to have antidepressant, anxiolytic, cognitive-enhancing, and stress-relieving effects via this action. Androgens, including testosterone and DHT, are known to downregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and this has been found to be due in part or full to their conversion into 3β-androstanediol rather than to activation of the AR. ==Biochemistry== 3β-Androstanediol is a 5α-reduced and 17β-hydroxylated metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as a 3β-hydroxylated metabolite of DHT (and by extension of testosterone). A determination of the circulating levels of 3β-androstanediol in humans found concentrations of 239 ± 76 pg/ml and 82 ± 45 pg/ml of the compound in normal male and female serum, respectively. 3β-Androstanediol shows high affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), similar to that of DHT. ==Chemistry== 3β-Androstanediol, also known as 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a structural analogue of DHT (5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one). A notable positional isomer of 3β-androstanediol is 3α-androstanediol. 17α-Ethynyl-3β-androstanediol is a 17α-substituted derivative of 3β-androstanediol and is an estrogen similarly. ==References== Category:5α-Reduced steroid metabolites Category:Androstanes Category:Antidepressants Category:Anxiolytics Category:Estrogens Category:Human metabolites Category:Selective ERβ agonists ","title":"3β-Androstanediol"},{"id":"35965220","text":"Anat Atzmon (, born 27 November 1958) is an Israeli actress and singer. ==Biography== Atzmon was born and raised in Tel Aviv.

The term comes from journalist Michael Kinsley, who said, \\"A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say.\\" The term gaffe may be used to describe an inadvertent statement by a politician that the politician believes is true while the politician has not fully analyzed the consequences of publicly stating it. Another definition is a statement made when the politician privately believes it to be true, realizes the dire consequences of saying it, and yet inadvertently utters, in public, the unutterable. Another definition is a politician's statement of what is on his or her mindthis may or may not be inadvertentthereby leading to a ritualized 'gaffe dance' between candidates. While exhibiting umbrage or shock, and playing on the mistake, the 'offended candidate' must not exhibit anything resembling glee. A propensity to concentrate on so-called 'gaffes' in campaigns has been criticized as a journalistic device that can lead to distraction from real issues.\\". . . the episode is a perfect gaffe precisely because its content was so meaningless. . .\\" The Kinsley gaffe is said to be a species of the general 'political gaffe.' Kinsley himself posed the question: \\"Why should something a politician says by accident automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?\\" Steven Pinker says that politicians use vague and indirect language to avoid making concrete statements, and that lazy journalists base political coverage around \\"gaffe spotting\\" rather than analysis of political platforms. The rise of Internet activism has created a new generation of negative campaigning where a political campaign can create attack ads within an hour of a politician making a gaffe. ==Notable gaffes by countryAustralia=== * On August 12, 2013, at a Liberal Party function in Melbourne as part of the 2013 Federal Election campaign, Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, criticising Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, said \\"No one, however smart, however well-educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom.\\" The word he meant was \\"repository\\". ===Azerbaijan=== * The Central Election Commission showed Ilham Aliyev to be winning with 72.76% of the vote via the Commission's official smartphone app a day before voting had even started for the 2013 elections. ===Canada=== * \\"Air pollution is the smell of money\\" – Philip Gaglardi. * Pierre Trudeau and the fuddle duddle incident, 1971 * Jacques Parizeau's 'money and the ethnic vote' speech, 1995 * Peter MacKay calling his ex- girlfriend Belinda Stronach a dog after she joined the opposition party. * \\"Evil reptilian kitten eater from another planet\\" – 2003 Ontario general election ===Israel=== * On the debate debate ןn israeli tv with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Isaac Herzog, the leader of the opposition said \\"i will keep Netanyau united\\", instead of i will keep Jerusalem united. ===Netherlands=== * During a 2009 speech in Mexico City, crown prince Willem- Alexander mistranslated the proverb \\"A sleeping shrimp gets carried away by the tide\\" roughly as \\"A sleeping shrimp gets screwed.\\" ===Poland=== * Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski told reporters on 10 January 2017 that he had established diplomatic relations with \\"San Escobar\\", a nonexistent country. ===Portugal=== * \\"Everyone will give their best for a poorer country\\" – Prime Minister José Sócrates. ===Romania=== * Victor Ponta's televised admission, after his party lost the 2008 election, that \\"their [the opponents'] system of electoral fraud worked better than ours\\" ===United Kingdom=== * Winston Churchill's election broadcast in the campaign for the 1945 general election in which he suggested that the Labour Party would create \\"some form of a Gestapo\\" to implement their reforms. * John Major calling some of his cabinet ministers bastards. * Gordon Brown referring to a member of the public as a \\"bigoted woman\\" during an election campaign. * Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature. ===United States=== * The Gerald Ford Soviet Domination answer. * The Jimmy Carter \\"Lust in the Heart\\" interview * We begin bombing in five minutes. – A joke by Ronald Reagan in a sound check prior to his weekly radio address that was later leaked. * \\"Oh, the vision thing.\\" – George H.

In 1543, the Turks occupied Székesfehérvár. The royal graves were ransacked and the basilica was used to store gunpowder while St. Martin's Cathedral in Pozsony became the new coronation site. In 1601, the valuable building was destroyed by fire.Historical past Phillips, Adrian; Scotchmer, Jo: Hungary, Bradt Travel Guides, 2010.Bedford, Neal; Dunford, Lisa; Fallon, Steve: Hungary, Lonely Planet, 2009.

The film is set in Italy but was filmed predominantly in West Germany. ==Plot== In 1958, the Catholic Church is investigating the case of a mysterious individual, Giacomo Nerone (Leigh Lawson), who is said to have performed miracles in a remote village in Southern Italy (Scontrone), before being executed by Italian Communist partisans in 1944. The process involves a \\"Devil's advocate\\", who is tasked with discovering any details about the subject's life which would indicate that canonisation would be inappropriate. Monsignor Blaise Meredith (John Mills) is given this responsibility, shortly after he learns he has terminal cancer. Meredith discovers that Nerone was actually a British soldier named James Black, who had become detached from the British Army during WW2 and was hiding in this village, where he began a relationship with a local woman. The film touches on homosexuality, priests cohabiting, persecution of Jews and other sensitive topics. ==Cast== * John Mills - Monsignor Blaise Meredith * Stéphane Audran - Anne, Contessa di Sanctis * Jason Miller - Dr Aldo Meyer * Paola Pitagora - Nina Sanduzzi * Leigh Lawson - James Black aka Giacomo Nerone * Timothy West - Father Anselmo * Patrick Mower - Il Lupo * Raf Vallone - Bishop Aurelio * Daniel Massey - Nicholas Black * Romolo Valli - Cardinal MarottaRadio TimesBritish Film Institute ==Production== Morris West wrote the screenplay from his novel of the same name.

It follows Staz, a vampire from the surreal Demon World, who meets Fuyumi Yanagi, an ordinary Japanese high school girl who accidentally wanders into the Demon World through a portal. Shortly after their meeting Fuyumi is killed by a carnivorous plant and turned into a ghost, causing Staz to take responsibility and pledge to help bring her back to life. An anime adaptation aired between July and September 2013 In North America, the manga has been licensed for an English language release by Yen Press. The anime series has been licensed by Viz Media for streaming on their website VizAnime and home video distribution in 2014. Neon Alley also acquired the series for streaming on their web service. ==Plot== Staz is a powerful vampire boss of a territory in the Demon World. Unlike his vampire ancestors, he prefers not to prey on humans, and would rather indulge in their Japanese otaku lifestyle of reading manga, watching anime, and playing video games. One day, he becomes excited when Fuyumi Yanagi, an ordinary Japanese high school girl, accidentally wanders into the Demon World through a portal. The two's first meeting is cut short by the attack of a demon who challenges his territory. When Staz goes to stop the demon, Fuyumi is killed by a carnivorous plant and turned into a ghost. Staz takes responsibility and pledges to help bring her back to life. When they take the portal, they learn that Fuyumi needs to drink Staz's blood in order to not fade away. They meet Hydra Bell, a treasure hunter who reveals her ability to open and close the portal was stolen, and that in order to restore Fuyumi they need the Book of Resurrection. After challenging his friend Wolf, who is the boss of Demon World West, he learns that Bell has the Book, but that Staz needs to get his big brother Braz to interpret it for him. Braz agrees to interpret the book provided that Staz stops Papradon Akim, a creature who tears his fallen enemies apart and uses their body parts to improve himself and his abilities. Meanwhile, Wolf and scientist Franken Stein (who created Akim) try to find a substitute to keep Fuyumi from fading. After Wolf fights Akim and Staz defeats Akim, Braz recruits Franken Stein to secretly work on another creature. Fuyumi is taken by Bell's brother Knell and delivered to their mother Neyn, who reveals that she is the fusion of the mother of Bell and the mother of Fuyumi, making the two girls sisters. Neyn asks Staz whether he is going to care for Fuyumi, which Staz agrees, so she releases him, only to later send a team of assassins called Team Fearless to hunt down Staz. Meanwhile, the Demon World Acropolis police officers Beros and Goyle arrest Braz for conspiring to overthrow the king of the demon world, Wolf Daddy. Braz escapes but agrees to deliver to Wolf Daddy a challenger to the throne. He places Akim's heart in the body of his late father and former king Richarz and revives him. However Richarz is no mood to fight Wolf Daddy. Braz and Staz learn that Richarz and Wolf Daddy had sealed up the essence of the demon king Herrschaft Grimm behind a door, but that it is too powerful. Akim manages to revive and recover his heart, killing Richarz and then absorbing Grimm's essence to become the new king of the Demon World. Wolf Daddy and the gang are forced to escape, while Braz stays on as a servant to Akim. Staz and Wolf want to take the throne back from Akim, so they start training under one of Wolf Daddy's old friends White Step. Akim creates a team of minions to harvest more body parts to grow stronger. To minimize this expansion, Wolf Daddy offers to Akim to fight a group of demons on the black list, a list of criminals who were so powerful they were hidden away and their existence erased from record. Akim agrees, and Wolf Daddy arranges for the blacklisted demons to come and train themselves. == Characters Main characters=== ; : : Staz is one of the territory bosses of Demon World East. Although he is the descendant of the noble vampire Dracula who would go to the human world to suck blood, he shows no interest in the vampire lifestyle, preferring to indulge himself in Japanese culture and media. For secondary vampire characteristics, he does not fly or have bat wings, he can eat garlic, he is not susceptible to crosses, and he heals rapidly. He is immediately attracted to Fuyumi, but when she is killed and becomes a ghost, he makes it his mission to bring her back to life. He struggles with his feelings about her, whether it is his desire to suck her dry as a mummy or whether it could be something romantic. In the human world, he carries a spray bottle of his spit that allows him to manipulate the memories of the humans there. He can also revive Fuyumi by giving her some of his blood. He describes his abilities as radiating with a range of up to tens of meters. When he was younger, his brother Braz sealed his full potential power by shooting him with a special bullet. This was because he was unable to handle his power and would collapse in a nose bleed after using the power. He is later freed from the restriction. ; : : Fuyumi is a Japanese high school girl who got lost in the Demon World after wandering into a portal that had opened in her bedroom. She is eaten by a carnivorous plant demon, and ends up a ghost / demon, leaving behind only her bones and clothes. She wears a hitaikakushi (white triangular headband) as a result. She accompanies Staz on his quest to bring her back to life. In the human world, she risks fading away so she must be replenished by Staz's blood or other methods. Prior to her adventures with Staz, she has been living with her father, but the whereabouts of her mother is unknown. When she starts fading in the demon world, Frankie discovers she might have a hybrid of demon attributes. It is later revealed that she and Bell became sisters, as her mother had merged with her doppelgänger counterpart from the demon world when they met each other. ; : : Hydrabell, or Bell for short, is a treasure hunter who is able to travel across dimensions and between the human and demon world using the Black Curtain.

She can teleport people away using a picture frame as the portal, and can spy on people by finger framing like a photographer. Although she determines that Staz is not the magic thief, she grows attracted to Staz, and secretly plans to win his affections. She learns later that Akim, when he was Pantomime, was the magic thief. The Volume 4 extra shows her corresponding with VIPs such as Bill Gates.. It is later revealed that her mother had met her doppelgänger counterpart on Earth and merged, making her and Fuyumi sisters. ; : : He is the hybrid lycanthrope who controls most of Demon World West. He is Staz's friend and rival, having known each other since Staz ran away from Acropolis. Staz says that Wolf uses his magic to strengthen his own body so he can excel in beating up on an opponent. He is of noble blood and was supposed to live in Acropolis, but admitted that he was abandoned because he is not a pure-blooded werewolf. According to himself, he is \\"a mix of lycanthrope and nobody\\". He can assume his fully transformed form for about three minutes, although if not done right, he only partially transforms. ===Supporting characters=== Demon World East ; : : Staz's right-hand man.

When they were younger, he conducted experiments on Staz to unlock his true potential. He later sealed Staz's powers away with a magic bullet that he shot into Staz's heart. While his intentions are always under suspicion from Staz, his motive is to dethrone Wolf Daddy's reign as King of Acropolis, since Wolf Daddy had killed his father. He orchestrates the creation of Papradon Akim and has Staz test his strength on him. One of his abilities is to manipulate blood. ; : (Japanese); Sherry Lynn (English) :Liz is Braz and Staz's younger sister.

Akim's true form is that of a phantom and he uses magic to manipulate the separate body parts which make up his physical form. Akim's entire creation was orchestrated by Braz, who anonymously delivered a demon corpse to Franken to serve as the central container for Akim. The corpse was later revealed to be a spy from Wolf Daddy named Pantomime. Akim's heart is placed in a new vessel that turns out to be Braz's father Richarz, but Akim is unable to control the body and only serves as a power source to keep the heart beating.

This is done to inflate the journal's impact factor, thus artificially boosting the journal's scientific reputation. Manipulation of impact factors and self-citation has long been frowned upon in academic circles; however, the results of a 2012 survey indicate that about 20% of academics working in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines have experienced coercive citation. Individual cases have also been reported in other disciplines. ==Background== The impact factor (IF) of a journal is a measure of how often, on average, papers published in the journal are cited in other academic publications. The IF was devised in the 1950s as a simple way to rank scientific journals. Today, in some disciplines, the prestige of a publication is determined largely by its impact factor.R. Monastersky, \\"The number that’s devouring science.\\" Chron. Higher Educ. (14 October 2005) Use of the impact factor is not necessarily undesirable as it can reasonably incentivise editors to improve their journal through the publication of good science. Two well- known academic journals, Nature and Science, had impact factors of 36 and 31 respectively. A respected journal in a sub-field, such as cognitive science, might have an impact factor of around 3.Sebastiaan Mathôt: \\"Cite my journal or else: Coercive self-citation in academic publishing\\" at COGSCIdotNL: Cognitive Science and more, 4 February 2012 However, impact factors have also become a source of increasing controversy. As early as 1999, in a landmark essay Scientific Communication — A Vanity Fair?, Georg Franck criticized citation counts as creating a marketplace where \\"success in science is rewarded with attention\\". In particular, he warned of a future \\"shadow market\\" where journal editors might inflate citation counts by requiring spurious references. In 2005, an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education called it \\"the number that's devouring science\\". ==Definition== When an author submits a manuscript for publication in a scientific journal, the editor may request that the article's citations be expanded before it will be published. This is part of the standard peer review process and meant to improve the paper. Coercive citation, on the other hand, is a specific unethical business practice in which the editor asks the author to add citations to papers published in the very same journal (self-citation) and in particular to cite papers that the author regards as duplicate or irrelevant. Specifically, the term refers to requests which: * Give no indication that the manuscript was lacking proper citations * Make no suggestion as to specific body of work requiring review * Direct authors to add citations only from the editor's own journal In one incident, which has been cited as a particularly blatant example of coercive citation, a journal editor wrote: \\"you cite Leukemia [once in 42 references]. Consequently, we kindly ask you to add references of articles published in Leukemia to your present article\\". Such a request would convey a clear message to authors: \\"add citations or risk rejection.\\" The effect of coercive citation is to artificially increase the journal's impact factor. Self-citation can have an appreciable effect: for example, in a published analysis, one journal's impact factor dropped from 2.731 to 0.748 when the self-citations were removed from consideration.Marco Pagano and Josef Zechner: \\"Review of Finance Report by the Managing Editors\\" Stockholm, 17 August 2011. Retrieved 28 May 2012. It is important to note that not all self-citation is coercive, or indeed improper. The practice of coercive citation is risky, as it may damage the reputation of the journal, and it hence has the potential of actually reducing the impact factor. Journals also risk temporary exclusion from Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Reports, an influential list of impact factors, for such practices. ==Practice== In 2012, Wilhite and Fong published results of a comprehensive survey of 6,700 scientists and academics in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines. In this survey, respondents were asked whether, when submitting a manuscript to a journal, they had ever been asked by the editor to include spurious citations to other papers in the same journal. Their findings indicate that 1 in 5 respondents have experienced coercive citation incidents, and that 86% regard it as unethical. A number of factors related to coercive citation have been identified. Coercion is significantly more prevalent in some academic disciplines than others. Wilhite and Fong found that \\"journals in the business disciplines\\" (such as marketing, management, or finance) \\"coerce more than economics journals\\", whereas coercion in psychology and sociology is \\"no more prevalent, or even less prevalent\\" than it is in economics. However, despite the differences in prevalence, they noted that \\"every discipline\\" in their study \\"reported multiple instances of coercion\\" and that \\"there are published references to coercion in fields beyond the social sciences.\\" The business journal industry has responded that they intend to confront the practice more directly. Wilhite and Fong also found that characteristics of publishers are correlated with coercion. In their findings, \\"journals published by commercial, for-profit companies show significantly greater use of coercive tactics than journals from university presses\\", and journals published by academic societies also showed a higher likelihood of coercion than journals from university presses. Five of the top ten offenders identified in their research came from the same commercial publishing house, Elsevier. There may also be a correlation between journal ranking and coercive citation. Some have suggested that larger and more highly ranked journals have more valuable reputations at stake, and thus may be more reluctant to jeopardize their reputations by using the practice. However, Wilhite and Fong found that: Commonalities have also been identified among the targets of coercion. Coercive citation is primarily targeted at younger researchers with less senior academic ranks and at papers with a smaller number of authors in order to have the greatest effect on the impact factor. It was also found that authors from non-English-speaking countries were more likely to be targeted. ==See also== * * * Goodhart's law == References  External links == * Phil Davis: \\"When Journal Editors Coerce Authors to Self-Cite\\".

This should activate T cells to attack the tumor. ==Type 1 diabetes therapies== Caladrius'CLBS03 project is attempting to eliminate or, at a minimum, reduce insulin dependence by balancing different types of T cells. The working theory is that people with T1D have an insufficient amount of regulatory T cells (Treg) compared to effector T cells, resulting in an imbalance in the immune system. If this balance is restored by increasing the number of regulatory T cells than the body will, according to the theory, stop attacking beta cells. http://thejdca.org/practical-cure- project-update-caladrius-biosciences-inc-treg Research participants undergo a three-part procedure. First, blood is drawn from the patient and the Treg cells are isolated and separated. Second, those Treg cells are used to manufacture a significant volume of additional Treg cells. Last, the manufactured Treg cells are mixed back into the drawn blood and returned through an IV to the person's body (See graphic below). One key benefit of this process is that it uses the person's own blood supply which minimizes the introduction of any foreign substance into the body.http://thejdca.org/practical-cure-project-update-caladrius-biosciences- inc-treg The current phase II trial is being conducted in conjunction with Sanford Health, a healthcare and research system headquartered in South Dakota.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02691247 ==References== Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Biotechnology companies established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Caladrius Biosciences"},{"id":"35965554","text":"Four Independent Olympic Athletes competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the United Kingdom. These were athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles, and from the newly formed state of South Sudan. This was the third time that athletes had competed as independent participants in the Olympics. None of the athletes won an Olympic medal. ==BackgroundNetherlands Antilles=== The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee, which had planned to continue functioning after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in October 2010, had its membership withdrawn by the IOC Executive Committee at the IOC session of July 2011. However, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality). Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes. ===South Sudan=== South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan in July 2011. As of the 2012 Summer Olympics, it had not formed a National Olympic Committee. Athletes from this nation were therefore unable to enter with a National Olympic Committee (NOC). Guor Marial qualified for the men's marathon and competed as an independent Olympian. ==Opening ceremony== Brooklyn Kerlin was the flag bearer of the athletes during the opening ceremony. She was chosen by her peers to represent the \\"makers of the Olympics\\".

The mineral is named for the Greek word σάρκιυος, meaning made of flesh, for its red color and greasy luster. The mineral was first noted in Sweden in 1865 as chondrarsenite, though not identified as Sarkinite until 1885. ==Description== Sarkinite is red to yellow in color. It occurs as thick tabular crystals, short prismatic crystals, or has a granular habit. Sarkinite sometimes aggregates into a roughly spherical shape. Sarkinite is a member of the Wagnerite Group. The mineral occurs in manganese- rich lenses in quartzitic chlorite schists, metamorphosed zinc ore bodies, and rarely in metamorphosed Fe–Mn ore bodies. ==Structure== Sarkinite is isostructural with triploidite and wolfeite and is a dimorph of eveite.Halenius, p. 113. The crystal structure consists of MnO4(OH)2 octahedra, MnO4(OH) trigonal bipyramids, and AsO4 tetrahedra.Dal Negro, p. 246. ==History== In 1885, two similar minerals were discovered in Sweden. Polyarsenite was found in Grythyttan and named by Igelström for its high arsenic content. Sarkinite was discovered in Pajsberg, Persberg, and named by A. Sjögren after the Greek word σάρκιυος, meaning made of flesh, in reference to the blood-red color and greasy luster. It was considered likely that the two minerals were identical. A study in 1980 showed that polyarsenite and chondrarsenite, discovered in 1865, were in fact both sarkinite. ==Distribution== , sarkinite has been found in Austria, France, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. ==Association== Sarkinite has been found in association with: Harstigen mine, Sweden *Barite, bementite, brandtite, calcite, lead Sjö mine, Sweden *Jacobsite, katoptrite, magnetite, tephroite Ködnitz Valley, Austria *Pyroxmangite, rhodochrosite, rhodonite, spessartine, tephroite, tiragalloite Falotta mine, Switzerland *Brandtite, braunite, grischunite, manganoan berzeliite, rhodochrosite, tilasite Sterling Hill, New Jersey, US *Adamite, allactite, barite, brandtite, copper, euchroite, eveite, kraisslite, manganese oxides, parabrandtite, rhodochrosite, serpierite, willemite ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * ==External links== Category:Manganese(II) minerals Category:Arsenate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ","title":"Sarkinite"},{"id":"35965606","text":"Parliamentary elections were held in Gazankulu on 7 September 1983.Elections in South Africa's Apartheid-Era Homelands \\"Bantustans\\" African Elections Database ==References== Category:1983 elections in Africa Category:1983 in South Africa Category:Elections in South African bantustans Category:Gazankulu ","title":"1983 Gazankulu legislative election"},{"id":"35965610","text":"Selected games on Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console offer online gaming or other online capabilities. Games that enable the feature provide free online play through the use of a broadband internet connection and a PlayStation 2 Network Adaptor. Since the service has no official name, it is sometimes referred as either PS2 Network Play, PS2 Network Gaming, or PS2 Online. The service was launched in July 2001 in Japan, August 2002 in North America, and in June 2003 in Europe. On \\"slimline\\" models, a network adapter is integrated into the hardware. Some games also allowed online gameplay using a dial-up connection (not available on all models), or LAN play by connecting two network adapters/slimline consoles together directly with an Ethernet cable or through the same router network. Instead of having a unified online service like SegaNet or Xbox Live, online multiplayer on the PS2 was the responsibility of the game publisher and was run on third-party servers. However, later PS2 online games required the console to be authorized through Sony's Dynamic Network Authentication System (DNAS) before connecting to the server. Unofficial servers also exist which could be connected by setting up the DNS settings to connect to an unofficial DNS server. Most recent PS2 online games have been developed to exclusively support broadband internet access. The last official online server, which was for Final Fantasy XI, was ultimately shut down on March 31, 2016, with the DNAS following it a couple of days later on April 4, indirectly shutting down several remaining unofficial servers, with the exception of ones that support non-DNAS PS2 titles such as Tribes: Aerial Assault and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Despite the DNAS shutdown, several fan created servers still exist; most require a DNAS workaround to connect, with some exceptions such as Call of Duty 3 and Need For Speed: Underground. ==Adapter== For the older models (non-Slim) of the PlayStation 2 console, a network adapter was needed to play online and use a hard drive. All versions of the Network Adapter provide an Ethernet port, while some North American versions also featured a phone-line port for dial-up connection. The newer slimline versions, however, have an Ethernet port built into them, making the Network Adapter unnecessary and hard drive use nearly impossible, as well as ruling out any need to keep the network adapter in production. Playing online games requires that users set up the system's network connection configuration, which is saved to a memory card. This can be done with the network Startup Disk that came with the network adapter or using one of the many games that had the utility built into them, such as Resident Evil Outbreak, to set up the network settings. The new slimline PlayStation 2 came with a disk in the box by default. The last version of the disk was network startup disk 5.0, which was included with the newer SCPH 90004 model released in 2009. However, as of December 31, 2012, the PlayStation 2 has been discontinued, and the servers for most games have all since been shut down. ==Games== Slim model with network adapter embedded. Released in 2002, Final Fantasy XI is the first ever console game to offer cross-platform play, connecting PlayStation 2 and personal computer. SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs, released in August of the same year, was one of the first video games that allowed voice chat on a console. ===Compatibility=== PAL games that supported online gaming display a WITH NET PLAY logo on their cover. North American games feature an \\"Online\\" icon in the lower right corner of the cover; on games that do not support dial-up connectivity, \\"broadband only\\" is also found on the logo. ===LAN tunneling=== Over time, most game servers have been shut down. However, computer programs such as XBSlink, SVDL and XLink Kai allow users to achieve online play for some PS2 games by using a network configuration that simulates a worldwide LAN. ==See also== *PlayStation Network *XLink Kai *List of PlayStation 2 online games ==References== Category:Multiplayer video game services Category:Online video game services Category:Computer-related introductions in 2001 Online (Network) ","title":"PlayStation 2 online functionality"},{"id":"35965617","text":"Olivia Nicole Martins (born November 26, 1991) is a Canadian former competitive ice dancer.

For the second season, Carla Abellana replaced Alcasid and Maxene Magalona is the additional host for the show's webisode. ==Selection process== In a series of steps, the show selects the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants. ===Contestant eligibility=== The eligible age-range for contestants is currently thirteen to twenty-one years old. However, in season one, there was no age limit. Since season one was a singing competition, groups could audition with a maximum number of five members. ===Auditions=== The mentors were tasked to roam around the country and scour different provinces and cities to find their bets for the competition.Protégé stages first live gala night this Sunday This is the first level of the competition wherein the mentors will invade their assigned audition sites. The mentors will be the guide of the protégés. They will groom and help the contestants to stay in the competition. A mentor's role is make his or her protégé shine. They will be aided by two Audition Masters in searching for their protégés. These two audition masters are renowned starmaker Jojie Dingcong and GMA Artist Center Head Arsi Baltazar. In the first season, aspiring proteges will come from two sources. First is the pre-screening done by the Audition Masters before the Regionals Proper. Second are the aspirants personally invited by the mentors based on the research that the staff conducted. When faced with the mentors, the aspiring Proteges will hear \\"Yes\\" if they are to be considered for the next round or \\"No\\" if they are not. Those who got a Yes will be pooled and the mentors will choose only three each that they will take with them to Manila.How Protege (GMA 7) works - The Hunt In season 2, the audition mechanics were basically the same except the audition sites rose from 10 key cities to 15. After the city auditions, Protégé also gave the hopefuls an alternative way to audition via online. ===Face Off Round=== Since the show shifted from a singing competition to an artista search, the selection process from Face Off Round to the finals made some major changes. In season 1, after the provincial auditions, the mentors are left with three protégés each, completing the Top 30 protégés. This is considered to be the Semi - Final Round. Top 30 protégés competed with each other where individual acts performs in front of the three judges. The judges then tell the mentors which of the three should be their protégé that they will pit against the other mentors' protégés. Thus, in the end of the Face Off round, every mentor will only have one protégé each. There will only be ten protégés competing in the next round.Protege - Top 30 Finalists in Face Off Round In season 2, there were eight shortlisted contestants per mentor with an overall total of 40 contestants. These 40 aspiring protégés once again faced their mentors for a further judgement. After that part, the mentors decided who will be their final 4 protégés -- 2 boys and 2 girls. After their decision, the 40 aspirants were reduced to 20 protégés and these 20 were revealed during the show's first gala night signalling that they are their mentors' official protégés. ===Finals=== The protégés from season 1 represented their audition city while in season 2, the four protégés represented their region. Season 1 was broadcast in prime time from CenterStage, SM Mall of Asia, Pasay City, in front of a live studio audience. The finals in season one lasted ten weeks. The ranking of votes was being revealed every after one finalist was done performing. However, the final ranking would not be revealed but the bottom group. During the first weeks, there was a bottom four but eventually it was reduced to bottom three and bottom two finalists. This method had been repeatedly done until three protégés remain. The finale of season one occurred at CenterStage in SM Mall of Asia. In season 2, the gala nights were held at Studio 7 of GMA Network. The top twenty protégés were reduced to top fifteen during the second gala night. The mentors eliminated one protégé each from them totaling to five protégés. It was based from the performances of their bottom two which is from the decision of the judges during the protégés' performances from the previous week. The text votes was introduced in the fourth gala night. The finale of season two was held at the GMA Network Studio 7. ===Rewards for winner and finalists=== In season 1, the winner, Krizza Neri received ₱ 1,000,000.00. Other than the cash prize, a 2-bedroom condo unit worth ₱ 3,000,000 and a five-year management contract with GMA Artist Center were also given. The winner, together with the runners-up, received a four- year scholarship grant from STI College.

Much of the auditions were held at SM Supermalls throughout the Philippines. The first season was directed by Rommel Gacho, and was hosted by Dingdong Dantes, Ogie Alcasid and Jennylyn Mercado. The judges, who scrutinized the protégés and their respective mentor throughout the competition are composed of Joey De Leon, Bert de Leon, Louie Ocampo and Eula Valdez. The mentors who groomed their protégés at their best were Aiza Seguerra, Claire de la Fuente, Gloc-9, Imelda Papin, Janno Gibbs, Jaya, Jay-R, Joey Generoso, Rachelle Ann Go and Rey Valera. The pilot episode aired on September 4, 2011. Out of thousands who auditioned for a stab at stardom, the initial cut was reduced to 30 and from 30 to only 10 protégés as finalists. The Ten underwent various workshops and trainings in order to hone their talents. ===Season 2=== Ruru Madrid serves as a contestant. According to the show's fan page, there will be a \\"new kind of battle\\". Rumor has it that the incoming season will feature the other talent like acting or dancing and eventually will be an artista search like StarStruck did and it turned out to be true. Protégé: The Battle For The Big Artista Break was first announced on the GMA Network Sunday entertainment program Party Pilipinas, where the hosts invited everyone to audition for the upcoming show. The network's winners from their reality shows did a production number to promote the show. Since the show shifted from singing competition to an overall competition, the mentors were also changed from household local musicians to the veteran actors and actresses composed of Roderick Paulate, Gina Alajar, Ricky Davao, Phillip Salvador and Jolina Magdangal. Joey De Leon and Bert de Leon continued their roles as judges with Annette Gozon-Abrogar and Cherie Gil as the new members of the panel. Carla Abellana replaced Ogie Alcasid as the journey host while Maxene Magalona joined the cast as the webjock. The pilot episode of Inside Protégé aired on July 23, 2012, and the first gala night was held on August 5, 2012. During the 5th gala night (aka Protégé Shock!), there were twists that were revealed: First, there was a multiple elimination leaving the 10 remaining protégés in the competition. Right after the results, the second twist was announced that the mentors have to keep only one protégé to stay under their guidance. Because of the multiple elimination, the mentors were not able to decide right away and instead, they told everyone that they will do the task the next week -- resulting to the suspension of the third twist. The third twist was the mentors had to choose from the other \\"mentor less protégés\\" except to their original protégé. ==Sub shows== Protégé: Pa Like's title card ===Inside Protégé=== Inside Protégé is the weekday version of Protégé.

It was the Sockers' fifth straight indoor title, as they had also won the North American Soccer League's indoor league in 1982 and 1984. ==Recap== For the most part, the league format remained unchanged. A 48-game season would be followed with an eight-team playoff, similar to the playoff system used from 1982 to 1984. There would be one major change in gameplay, however. The shootout, part of the MISL since its inception, was dropped in favor of multiple overtime periods to decide games, if necessary. There was a steady national TV contract for the first time since 1983, as ESPN would televise 15 regular-season games and assorted playoff games. The East and West division races were a study in contrasts. San Diego ran away with the West again, despite selling reigning league MVP Steve Zungul to the Tacoma Stars for $200,000 halfway through the regular season. Tacoma would go 11-8 with Zungul, who won the league scoring title for the sixth time in the MISL's eight years. However, the Stars lost in four games to the Sockers in the league semifinals. In the East, the six-team division was separated by only four games. The playoff positions were only confirmed when the Baltimore Blast defeated the Pittsburgh Spirit in the season finale. The Dallas Sidekicks switched divisions and promptly won 13 more games than the previous year, making the playoffs for the first time and earning Gordon Jago Coach of the Year honors. For the second straight year, the Strikers and Sockers went to a deciding game in their playoff matchup. San Diego became the first team to rally from a two-game deficit to win a MISL playoff series, as the Strikers' 3-1 lead in the championship series disappeared under three straight Socker wins. In the first seventh game in MISL history, the Sockers held off a late Minnesota charge to win 5-3. San Diego's Brian Quinn scored two goals and an assist on his way to playoff MVP honors. After the season, the Spirit folded, and the league made plans to return to New York with an expansion franchise. ==Teams== {  - !Team !City/Area !Arena - Baltimore Blast Baltimore, Maryland Baltimore Arena - Chicago Sting Chicago Chicago Stadium - Cleveland Force Cleveland, Ohio Richfield Coliseum - Dallas Sidekicks Dallas, Texas Reunion Arena - Kansas City Comets Kansas City, Missouri Kemper Arena - Los Angeles Lazers Inglewood, California The Forum - Minnesota Strikers Bloomington, Minnesota Met Center - Pittsburgh Spirit Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Civic Arena (Pittsburgh) - San Diego Sockers San Diego, California San Diego Sports Arena - St. Louis Steamers St. Louis, Missouri St. Louis Arena - Tacoma Stars Tacoma, Washington Tacoma Dome - Wichita Wings Wichita, Kansas Kansas Coliseum } ==Regular season schedule== The 1985–86 regular season schedule ran from October 25, 1985, to April 6, 1986.

Meshulam became widely known in the affair which began on Passover in 1994. During that time Meshulam distributed pamphlets which described the kidnappings of Jewish Yemenite children and stated that around 4,500 children of Jewish Yemenite immigrants were taken from their parents by the Israeli authorities and given to rich Ashkenazi Jews inside Israel and abroad during the late 1940s and early 1950s while the Yemenite immigrants were falsely told that their babies had died from illness or malnutrition.Yemeni Jews describe their holocaust: Sarah Helm in Yehud reports on claims that Israelis stole 4,500 children from immigrants - World - News - The Independent After a local conflict between Meshulam and a sewer contractor escalated, police forces intervened, and in the stir of the emotions Meshulam and his followers called for a commission of inquiry into the disappearance of the Yemenite children. Meshulam's followers barricaded his home with sandbags and stones and armed themselves with many weapons. As a result, a large force of police, snipers and a Special Patrol Unit surrounded Meshulam's house for weeks. On May 10, at 3:00 AM, Meshulam left his followers in his home in order to meet with the Police Commissioner Assaf Hefetz. At this point the police forces broke into the house and 11 followers were arrested. One of them, 19-year-old Shlomi Assouline, was killed by the police during the raid.The Uzi Meshulam precedent - Haaretz Daily Newspaper  Israel Newsילדי תימן תחילה - גלובס Meshulam's followers were accused of a number of offenses: conspiracy to commit a crime, obstructing justice, an attempt to injury with serious intent, threats, deliberate risk of human lives, and manufacturing illegal weapons. As a result Meshulam's followers were sentenced to prison terms of between 15 months to five years. Meshulam himself was convicted of providing instruction to throw Molotov cocktails at police forces and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to 8 years but was eventually cleared of one of the charges, so that his sentence was reduced to six and a half years,דיון נוסף - כעתירת העותרים בדנ\\"פ 1294/96 (להלן, ביחד, העותרים), וכעתירת המדינה בדנ\\"פ 1365/96 - במספר סוגיות, בהן פסק בית המשפט העליון בשלושה, בע\\"פ 1632/95 משולם ואח' נ' מדינת ישראל (פ\\"ד מט(5) 534). , of which he served five years after president Ezer Weizman reduced the term by seven months. In October 1994 a warden at Meshulam's prison was shot by two of Meshulam's followers, but he eventually survived the attack. The attackers were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. Following these events, the Kedmi Commission was established in January 1995. It was headed by a former Supreme Court justice Yehuda Cohen. The Kedmi Commission investigated for nearly 7 years the disappearance cases of the Yemenite immigrants' children between in 1948 - 1954. The Committee's report provided explanations for many of the cases of disappearances, but found no evidence of a conspiracy in the matter, although 56 cases are still considered open cases.Yemenite children In January 1996 Meshulam was transferred to the Shata prison. Shortly after his health worsened and he was hospitalized. His followers continued to protest and call for his release, though the public protests eventually diminished. In 2016, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed cabinet member Tzachi Hanegbi to re-examine the evidence. Hanegbi told Israeli TV: “They took the children and gave them away. I don’t know where.” He acknowledged that “hundreds” of children were taken without their parents’ consent, the first time such a public admission had been made by a government official.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/middleeast/israel-yemenite- children-affair.html ==Death== On June 21, 2013, Meshulam died at the age of 60. ==External links== *The Cry of Truth website - the website made by Emmanuel (Ami) Meshulam which is dedicated to his father. *Rabbi's son plans to sue Israel in ICC - posted on Ynet on 25 December 2009 ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Israeli criminals Category:Israeli people of Yemeni-Jewish descent Category:Israeli rabbis Category:2013 deaths ","title":"Uzi Meshulam"},{"id":"35965788","text":"Pappophorum vaginatum is a species of grass known by the common name whiplash pappusgrass.

A different measure of media concentration was used for broadcasting in the same study, that of ownership of stations (including stations with no news content), rather than by ratings. The largest radio company was Newcap Broadcasting which owned 32 of 92 total stations, Rogers Media owned 14, and James A. Pattison owned nine. In television, the largest companies were Bell Media with four stations, Rogers with four, Shaw Media with three, and the CBC with three (two English-language, one French). === Political bias === In 1937, the Social Credit government of Wiliam Aberhart passed the Accurate News and Information Act which forced newspapers to print \\"corrections\\" to stories the government objected to, and would require the papers to reveal their sources in the case of statements against the government. This bill became part of a constitutional crisis between the lieutenant governor and the federal government on one side, and the Social Credit government (especially its radical wing represented by the Social Credit Board) on the other. This led to the Reference re Alberta Statutes case in the Supreme Court which ruled the act to be ultra vires (unconstitutional). As well the Edmonton Journal won a special Pulitzer Prize for Press Freedom for fighting against the law, the only non-American newspaper ever to have done so. The Foundation for Democratic Advancement’s study stated that the media coverage of the political parties in the 2012 election was biased, in their opinion, in that it focused overwhelmingly on the two supposed front- runner parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the Wildrose Party, as these parties received 62% of media coverage although seven other political parties fielded candidates, including two (the Alberta Liberals and the Alberta New Democrats) that fielded candidates in every constituency. The two front- running parties went on to capture 77.3% of the popular vote. == See also == ;By medium *List of newspapers in Alberta *List of radio stations in Alberta *List of television stations in Alberta ;By city *Media in Banff, Alberta *Media in Calgary *Media in Edmonton *Media in Fort McMurray *Media in Grande Prairie *Media in Lethbridge *Media in Medicine Hat *Media in Red Deer, Alberta == References == * ","title":"Media in Alberta"},{"id":"35965937","text":"Thomas Barrows III is a sailor who lives in the United States Virgin Islands and attended Yale University, where he won the ICSA Men's Singlehanded National Championship in 2008 and earned the ICSA College Sailor of the Year Award in 2010.

He was one of the two first missionaries to preach in Tonga and served as president of the Tongan mission from July 1891 to October 1892. Smoot was the son of Abraham O. Smoot and the brother of Reed Smoot. ==Early life and family== Brigham Smoot was born on June 15, 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to Abraham O. Smoot and Anne K. Mauritsen, his fifth of six plural wives. Brigham's brother Reed Smoot went on to be a businessman and an apostle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) before being elected by the state legislature as United States Senator from Utah in 1903. Smoot was baptized into the LDS Church on June 17, 1877. His family moved to the frontier town of Provo, Utah, when his father was called by Brigham Young to establish a church stake there. Brigham Smoot graduated from Brigham Young Academy in Provo, a school for which his father had been the major financial backer. ==Missionary work== In June 1889, Brigham Smoot was sent at the age of 20 on a mission for the LDS Church to Samoa. Smoot sailed there and was assigned as a companion to Edward J. Wood. During his second day in Samoa, Smoot joined Wood and the other missionaries for a bath in the ocean. While wading in the ocean, Smoot slipped into a deep hole in the reef. After being dead for several minutes, Smoot was revived by Butler by what they described as a priesthood blessing. Sent to open a mission in July 1891, Smoot and Alva J. Butler became the first LDS missionaries in Tonga. On July 16, 1891, they met with King George Tupou I, who granted them permission to proselyte in Tonga. The first proselyting session in Tonga was held by Smoot and Butler on August 1, 1881. On November 22, 1881 Smoot and Butler leased the first piece of land for the LDS Church. On January 24, 1892 the first official LDS church meeting was conducted by Smoot and Butler in the mission home. Smoot dedicated the mission home on May 15, 1892. He later became the president of the Tongan Mission of the LDS Church from July 14, 1891 to October 24, 1892. He returned to Utah in December 1892. ==Career== After returning from his mission, Brigham Smoot graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1898. After graduation, Smoot returned to Utah and worked for the mining industry in Eureka. On June 20, 1900 he married Margaret Annella Nesbit in Provo, Utah. Roland Nesbit Smoot was born on May 7, 1901. A year later, he had a daughter named Annella Kerstina Smoot. Beginning in 1901, he worked as a supervisor for the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, which processed sugar cane. Smoot was eventually promoted to general superintendent. After he retired in 1937, he moved to Pasadena, California. He lived there until his death on December 16, 1946. ==FootnotesReferences *Brigham Smoot family papers, Vault MSS 3315, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B.

It was discovered in England in 1923 and named diaboleite, from the Greek word διά and boleite, meaning \\"distinct from boleite\\". The mineral has since been found in a number of countries. ==Description== Diaboleite crystal from a slag occurrence in the Laurium District, Attica, Greece (size: less than 1 mm) Diaboleite is deep blue in color and pale blue in transmitted light. The mineral occurs as tabular crystals up to in size, as subparallel aggregates, or it has massive habit. Vicinal forms of the tabular crystals have a square or octagonal outline and rarely exhibit pyramidal hemihedralism. ==Formation== Diaboleite occurs in manganese oxide ores, as a secondary mineral in lead and copper oxide ores, and in seawater-exposed slag. Diaboleite has been found in association with atacamite, boleite, caledonite, cerussite, chloroxiphite, hydrocerussite, leadhillite, mendipite, paratacamite, phosgenite, and wherryite. A study in 1986 synthesized diaboleite crystals up to in size using two different methods. The study demonstrated that diaboleite is a low- temperature phase, that is stable under hydrothermal conditions at temperatures less than . At higher temperatures, the first stable mineral to form is cumengeite.Winchell, p. 934. ==History== In 1923, diaboleite was discovered at Higher Pitts Mine in the Mendip Hills of Somerset, England, and described by L. J. Spencer and E.D. Mountain.Spencer, p. 78. The study of the similar mineral boleite was perplexing at the time and this new mineral only compounded the difficulty. As insufficient material was available for a full investigation, Spencer and Mountain named it diaboleite, meaning \\"distinct from boleite\\", out of \\"desperation\\".Spencer, p. 79.

By the end of his long career, Whitford Kane's theatre credits had grown to fill three columns in John Parker's Who's Who in the Theatre.Actor for Five Decades, Marks 75th Birthday and 56th Production; New York Times; January 30, 1956; pg. 24; Whitford Kane, Actor, 75, Dead New York Times; December 18, 1956; pg. 31 ==Biography== Kane was born on January 30, 1881 in Larne, a seaport on the east coast of County Antrim, Ireland (today a part of Northern Ireland), to Dr. John Kane and the former Isabella Whiteford.Ireland, Births and Baptisms 1620-1911 - Ancestry.comTwentieth- Century British Theatre: Industry, Art and Empire By Claire Cochrane, 2011, pg. 88 He first took to the stage in Belfast while in his early 20s, and by 1910 was performing on the London stage. Kane's first known Broadway performance, the idle inventor, Daniel Murray, in Rutherford Mayne's comedy, The Drone, came in 1912, the year he immigrated to America. He would go on to be involved in some fifty-six Broadway productions over a near fifty-three year acting career that only closed due to illness as he neared the end of his life.Whitford Kane; World War II Draft Registration; Ancestry.com Kane typically played character roles often described as likable and benign. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson wrote of Kane's performance as Dr. Wilson in John Steinbeck's 1942 play, The Moon Is Down, \\"As the benign village doctor, Whitford Kane, one of the best pipe-smokers on the stage, presides in cheerful humor.\\" He played the First Gravedigger in 23 productions of Hamlet, supporting such actors as John Barrymore, Maurice Evans, Walter Hampden and Godfrey Tearle. When asked why he played in so many Shakespearean productions, Kane replied, \\"It's saved my bacon a good many times. The old gravedigger has fed me better than any other part. I earn my eats by Shakespeare; thank God it's always coming up.\\" Whitford Kane appeared in a handful of films over the 1930s and 40s, the most memorable probably being The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944) starring Fredric March, and the 1947 film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, in which he played the publisher Mr. Sproule. His career extended into the early years of television where the \\"round little man with a plum for a nose, a plump chin and ruddy full-blown cheeks\\" was one Christmas Eve called upon to play Santa Claus. Kane was a member of the cast that appeared in the very early NBC 1939 Teleplay, The Streets of New York and the 1954 Hallmark Hall of Fame production of King Richard II that was adapted for television by Maurice Evans. Marian Warring-Manley as Margery, Whitford Kane as Simon Eyre, and George Coulouris as the King in the Mercury Theatre production of The Shoemaker's Holiday (1938) For a good number of years, Kane trained young actors for the stage at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and later in New York with the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. As director of the Goodman Theatre, Kane once awarded a young Orson Welles a drama prize. Some years later the two developed a close friendship with Kane becoming a key member of Welles's Mercury Theatre repertory company.Films of Orson Welles By Charles Higham; 1970; Pg. 6 Kane's final Broadway performance came early in 1956 as Samuel in Seán O'Casey's drama, Roses for You, before closing out his career that summer at the American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Connecticut. By then, Kane was struggling with cancer, but refused to cut back on his commitments in order to preserve his record of only missing one performance in over fifty years of theatre work. Whitford Kane died at the age of 75 on December 17, 1956 in New York City. He was survived by a brother and sister and his partner of over 25 years, actor Hiram Sherman.Found In The Drama Mailbag, New York Times December 30, 1956; pg. X3 A few days after his passing, actor Will Geer wrote in a letter to The New York Times Drama Editor, \\"Whitford Kane was an expert teacher and had a following as stout as any 'studio' of the day. For fifty years he taught that an actor's warmth must burst through the proscenium arch. Sometimes he would gallop into the parlors with such Christmas horseplay as 'St. George and the Dragon.' For he was always ready to tilt at sham or tinsel in the theatre of life. I can hear him today; Yes Virginia Rouns Patrick Dennis Tanner, there is a real Auntie Mame.\\" Whitford Kane published his autobiography Are we all met? in 1931.Are we all met?

This species grows to a length of TL. This species is commercially harvested for human consumption. Most notably, in South Korea where it is known as agwi (아귀), it is the key ingredient of agujjim (아구찜). This was originally invented in the town of Masan: historically, agwi fish were discarded by the fishermen, as they were considered unsellable due to their ugly appearance. But around the mid-20th century, the food stall cooks at the Masan market took up the challenge to turn the waste into a tasty dish. As it turned out, preparing L. setigerus in jjim style (steamed in a spicy and hot marinade) brought its agreeable flavor and peculiar texture out well, besides delivering a healthy dose of protein. Agwi is now a nationally popular dish, with many scores of specialist restaurants found across the country. As a side note, L. setigerus is traditionally combined in agwi with the ascidian tunicate Styela clava (mideodeok, 미더덕).

It is the eighth track and third single from the band's second and final studio album, Grinderman 2, and was released on 14 March 2011 on Mute Records. Produced by Nick Launay and written collectively by vocalist Nick Cave, multi- instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey and drummer Jim Sclavunos, the song has been described as an \\"atypically straightforward love song\\" and was written for Cave's wife, Susie Bick. Grinderman was accused of plagiarism by Frankie Duffy, the frontman of the defunct Scottish rock band Rising Signs, upon \\"Palace of Montezuma\\" inclusion on Grinderman 2. Duffy claimed the song was a rip-off of the Rising Signs' 2005 song \\"Grey Man,\\" however, Nick Cave denied the claims. Upon its single release, \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" received positive critical acclaim, though the song failed to chart. ==Origin and recording== \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" was recorded during the sessions for Grinderman 2. The sessions began in August 2008 at RAK Studios in London, United Kingdom and continued in State of the Ark and Assault & Battery 2 until August 2009. Nick Cave has claimed that Grinderman had initially planned leaving the song off the album. Three versions of the songs were mixed. The album mix was by producer Nick Launay. A single and radio edit version was mixed by Cenzo Townshend, which featured alterations including increasing the tempo, editing out the final refrains and adding different vocal takes. The third version was a remix by former Bad Seed Barry Adamson, stripping most of the guitar instrumentation and emphasising the piano. Adamson's remix was featured as one of the single's three b-sides and was included on the remix album, Grinderman 2 RMX (2012). The song's title refers to the Moctezuma II, the Aztec leader and ruler of Tenochtitlan from 1502 to 1520. The song was used as an outro to an episode of the BBC Psychological Thriller series Luther. ==Composition== \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" is written in the key of E major with the main guitar riff constructed from four chords (E–G5–A5–B5). The song's chorus reverts to three fifth chords(A5–E5–B5). The song uses a I–V-II chord progression. The music was composed by multi- instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey and drummer Jim Sclavunos and has been described as \\"a meditative pop song that you can either boogie to, or kiss your baby goodnight to.\\" The song's lyrics were written by Nick Cave and have been described as an \\"atypically straightforward love song\\" and \\"a list of over-the-top romantic promises; its protagonist, having initially offered up a 'custard-coloured super dream of Ali McGraw [sic] and Steve McQueen.\\" The lyrics make allusions to other people in popular culture, including Mata Hari, Miles Davis, John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and historical figures including Akbar the Great and Gilgamesh. Cave has since said that the song was written for his wife, Susie Bick. ===Plagiarism claims=== In October 2010, Frankie Duffy, the frontman of the defunct Scottish rock band Rising Signs, accused Grinderman of plagiarism, claiming \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" was a rip-off Rising Signs' 2005 song \\"Grey Man.\\" In an interview with The Courier, Duffy said \\"it's exactly the same A, E and B chords, which to be fair anybody could use to write a song at any time. But it's the chord progression and when the vocal hook comes in with some ooohs, it's exactly the same, you can just hear it's the same thing.\\" Duffy added \\"it could be a really huge, amazing coincidence\\" but considered taking legal action if Grinderman's management did not respond to his claims. Nick Cave denied the claims during a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 1 October 2010. ==Release and reception== \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" was initially released on Grinderman 2, released on 13 September 2010. On 25 January 2011, Grinderman announced that the song was due to be released as the band's third single from the album. The single was released on 14 March 2011 as a digital download. A limited edition multi-coloured 12\\" LP was released as part of Record Store Day 2011 on 16 April 2011. Critical response to \\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" was positive. Artrocker magazine awarded the single a full five stars, and said the song \\"gives Cave his most soulful, intimate and accessible vocal since 'Into My Arms', delivered to a subtle but groovy dance beat and a tender gospel atmosphere.\\" Pitchfork Media reviewer Sean Fennessey referred to the song as \\"a 'We Didn't Start the Fire' for heroin addicts, haunted by visions of Miles Davis, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, and 'a custard-colored super- dream of Ali MacGraw and Steve McQueen'\\" and called it \\"unhinged and unerringly beautiful.\\" and Sean O'Neill of The A.V. Club said the song was \\"even breaking the band's own 'No love, no piano' creed\\" and referred to it as \\"grandiloquent.\\" ==Track listing== ;Digital download and 12-inch single #\\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" (Cenzo mix) – 3:15 #\\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" (Barry Adamson remix) – 4:58 #\\"Palaces of Montezuma\\" – 3:32 #\\"When My Baby Comes\\" (Cat's Eyes remix) – 5:27 ==Personnel== All personnel credits adapted from Grinderman 2s liner notes. ;Grinderman *Nick Cave – vocals, electric guitar, piano *Warren Ellis – electric guitar, backing vocals *Martyn P.

Neuman Cohn Ferrater Mora (; 14 December, 1933 – 27 June, 2019) was an American philosopher and animal rights activist. She was Emerita Professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State University, associate director of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, and co-editor of the centre's Journal of Animal Ethics. == Life and work == Cohn was born to Simon and Helen Neuman, one of five children, in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, in 1933. She studied at Haverford Friends School, leaving early to study at Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr. In 1951, she eloped with Willard Cohn. Cohn then enrolled in Bryn Mawr College, earning a bachelor’s, a master’s, and a PhD in philosophy, between 1956 and 1969. She wrote her thesis on the work of Heidegger; her doctoral advisor was the Spanish philosopher José Ferrater Mora. She separated with Willard Cohn in 1969 (they divorced in 1980); Cohn married Ferrater Mora the same year. She taught philosophy for more than 35 years at Pennsylvania State University, writing on a variety of topics including animals, environmental issues, and ethical problems, as well as on contemporary philosophers and the history of philosophy, publishing in both English and Spanish. Cohn was made full Professor in Philosophy at Pennsylvania State University in 1982, and was made Professor Emerita at Pennsylvania State University Abington in 2001. She pioneered courses in animal ethics and lectured on five continents. For three years, 1990–1993, she was Director of the Summer School Course in animal rights at Complutense University (Madrid) at El Escorial — which were the first courses of their kind in Spain. She also taught the Graduate School Course on Applied Ethics at the University of Santiago de Compostela, in 1991. Her interest in wildlife was reflected in her work as the founder and director of P.N.C. Corp, a nonprofit animal rights foundation that organised the first international conference on contraception in wildlife in the United States and initiated and funded the first PZP fertility control study on white-tailed deer. She was also a board member of The Fund for Animals and Humane USA. == Death == Cohn died at her home in Villanova, Pennsylvania, on 27 June, 2019, due to complications relating to Parkinson's disease. == Selected publications == * Etica aplicada ('; Alianza Editorial, 1981), written with José Ferrater Mora, containing the first essay on animal rights published in Spain * Contraception in Wildlife (Edwin Mellen Press, 1996), edited with E.

He made his debut as a senior with the reserves at the age of just 17, going on to spend several seasons in the third division. Marí made his first appearance with the first team on 7 December 2011, playing 30 minutes in a 2–2 draw against Granada CF after coming off the bench for fellow youth graduate Pedro Bigas. On 5 May 2012 he played his second La Liga game, again acting as a substitute in a 1–0 home win over Levante UD. Marí continued to be almost exclusively associated with the B-side until the end of his spell in the Balearic Islands. ===Gimnàstic=== On 2 September 2013, Marí signed a contract with Gimnàstic de Tarragona also in the third level. He made his debut for the Catalans on 12 October, starting and conceding a penalty in a 2–2 draw at CD Olímpic de Xàtiva. Marí scored his first goal for Nàstic on 1 December 2013, the winner in a 2–1 home victory against Levante UD B. On 25 June 2015, after achieving promotion to Segunda División, he signed a new three-year deal with the club. Marí scored his first professional goal on 30 August 2015, netting his team's first in a 2–1 away defeat of CD Tenerife. ===Manchester City=== On 15 August 2016, Marí was transferred to Premier League side Manchester City. A day later, he was loaned to Girona FC in a season-long deal. In the following two campaigns, still owned by City, Marí played with NAC Breda (Dutch Eredivisie, where he was team captain) and Deportivo de La Coruña (Spanish second tier). ===Flamengo=== On 11 July 2019, Marí signed with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo on a contact through 2022, for an approximate fee of €1.3 million (or R$5.5 million). He became the third Spanish player for the Brazilian club, after goalkeeper Talladas in the late 30s and forward José Ufarte in the 60s. He made his debut as a starter on 28 July in a Série A match against Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas at the Maracanã Stadium, a 3–2 win; he quickly established himself in the first team, with manager Jorge Jesus pairing him with Rodrigo Caio. Marí scored his first goal for Mengão on 25 August 2019, with a volley inside the box in a 3–0 away victory over Ceará Sporting Club. His second in the league came on 7 September, this time with a header against Avaí FC in a 3–0 win at Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha. In November, he became the first Spaniard to win the Copa Libertadores, the major South American club competition. ===Arsenal=== On 29 January 2020, Marí joined English Premier League club Arsenal on loan until the end of the season, with an option for Arsenal to make the deal permanent in the summer. Arsenal's technical director Edu said: “Pablo is an experienced player who will provide us with additional defensive quality. We have been monitoring Pablo’s career for a while and we are very pleased to have reached agreement with Flamengo for him to join us initially until the end of our season.\\" Marí made two appearances for Arsenal, a 2–0 FA Cup win at Portsmouth and a 1–0 Premier League win at home to West Ham, before the season was suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Marí was injured playing in a 0–3 defeat at Man City, a club he was once on the books of, in the first game of the league restart. Arsenal confirmed post-match he would miss the remainder of the season with a 'significant' ankle injury. Despite this injury, Arsenal announced on 24 June that Marí would join the club permanently for an undisclosed fee on 1 July, upon the opening of the summer transfer window. ==Career statistics== {   + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Mallorca B 2010–11  rowspan=\\"3\\" Segunda División B 191colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—191 - 2011–12 221colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—221 - 2012–13 281colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—281 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !69!!3!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!693 - Mallorca 2011–12 La Liga 2000colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—20 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Gimnàstic 2013–14  rowspan=\\"2\\" Segunda División B 29230colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—322 - 2014–15 37320colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—393 - 2015–16 Segunda División 25100colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—251 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !91!!6!!5!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!96!!6 - Manchester City 2016–17 Premier League 0000000000 - Girona (loan) 2016–17 Segunda División 8010colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—90 - NAC (loan) 2017–18 Eredivisie 20110colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—211 - Deportivo (loan) 2018–19 Segunda División 38200colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—382 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Flamengo 2019 Série A 222colspan=\\"2\\"—6Appearances in Copa Libertadores12Appearances in FIFA Club World Cup0303 - Arsenal (loan) 2019–20  rowspan=\\"2\\" Premier League 201000colspan=\\"2\\"—30 - Arsenal 2020-21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !252!!14!!8!!0!!6!!1!!2!!0!!268!!15 } ==Honours== Flamengo *Campeonato Brasileiro Série A: 2019 *Copa Libertadores: 2019 Individual *Campeonato Brasileiro Série A Team of the Year: 2019 ==References *Profile at the Arsenal F.C. website * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ribera Baixa Category:Valencian footballers Category:Spanish footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:RCD Mallorca B players Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Gimnàstic de Tarragona footballers Category:Girona FC players Category:Deportivo de La Coruña players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Eredivisie players Category:NAC Breda players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série A players Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Brazil Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Premier League players ","title":"Pablo Marí"},{"id":"35966597","text":"Following are the results of the 1974–75 season of the Detroit Pistons, the franchise of the National Basketball Association based in Detroit, Michigan.

As a result of changes to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, the number of seats in the House of Commons of Canada increased from 308 to 338. The previous electoral redistribution was in 2003. ==Background and previous attempts at reform== Prior to 2012, the redistribution rules for increasing the number of seats in the House of Commons of Canada was governed by section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as last amended in 1985. As early as 2007, attempts were made to reform the calculation of how that number was determined, as the 1985 formula did not fully take into account the rapid population growth being experienced in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario.

In introducing the bill, the government's stated aims were: #allocating more seats to better reflect population grown in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta; #maintaining the number of seats for slower-growing provinces; and #maintaining the proportional representation of Quebec according to population. The Act replaced s. 51(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867 with the following formula:Fair Representation Act, s. 2 #Divide the estimated population of a province by a determined electoral quotient (initially set at 111,166). #If the number of members determined is less than what a province had in 1985, increase its seat count to that number (the \\"grandfather clause\\"). #If a province's population was overrepresented in the House of Commons at the completion of the last redistribution process, and would now be under-represented based on the calculations above, it will be given extra seats so that its share of House of Commons seats is proportional to its share of the population (the \\"representation rule\\"). #Add one seat for each of the territories. The 1985 minimum has two components: #No province can have fewer MPs than it has Senators (the \\"senatorial clause\\"). #Otherwise, the calculation determined in 1985 under the Constitution Act, 1985 (Representation) will govern the amount. {  style=\\"text- align:right\\" + Allocation of Seats in the House of Commons (electoral quotient of 111,166) - valign=\\"top\\" !

Contains the Highway corridor west of Calgary to the B.C. border as well as Calgary's northern exurbs. *Battle River: Created out of the southern half of Vegreville—Wainwright and the northern half of Crowfoot and a small part of the eastern part of Red Deer. Contains much of rural Central Eastern Alberta. Named for the Battle River which flows through it. *Bow River: Created out of the eastern half of Macleod, the northwestern corner of Medicine Hat and the southwestern quadrannt of Crowfoot. Contains the Highway 1 corridor east of Calgary past Brooks. The riding also includes Vulcan and the Highway 2 corridor roughly between Nanton and Fort Macleod. Named for the Bow River which flows through it. *Calgary Centre: This riding shifts eastward, moving the western boundary to 37 St SW and moving the eastern boundary to the Bow River. *Calgary Confederation: Created mostly from Calgary Centre-North, except losing the area north of McKnight Blvd and John Laurie Blvd. It also takes in the part of Calgary West north of the Bow River and east of Nose Hill Drive and Stony Trail. Named for Confederation Park. *Calgary Forest Lawn: Created mostly from parts of Calgary Northeast and Calgary Southeast and newly annexed territory of the City of Calgary that is now in the riding of Crowfoot. The riding takes in the part of Calgary Northeast south of a line following McKnight Blvd to Falconbridge Blvd to 32nd Ave and takes in the part of Calgary Southeast north of a line following the Bow River to 32 Ave SE to the CNR to 17 Ave SE. Riding named for the neighbourhood of Forest Lawn. *Calgary Heritage: Created mostly out of Calgary Southwest, except a few small parts of Calgary Southeast caused by adjusting the eastern boundary of the riding to follow Macleod Trail. The southern boundary of the riding is also adjusted compared to Calgary Southwest, as it would follow 24 St SW to Spruce Meadows Trail to James McKevitt Rd. The riding is likely named for Heritage Park. *Calgary McCall: Created almost entirely out of Calgary Northeast except for newly annexed territory of the City of Calgary now in the riding of Wild Rose. The riding would contain all of Calgary Northeast not in the proposed riding of Calgary Forest Lawn. The riding is likely named after the McCall Industrial Park or the provincial riding of the same name. *Calgary Midnapore: Created mostly out of Calgary Southeast but also contains parts of Calgary Southwest, Calgary East and newly annexed territory by the city of Calgary in the current riding of Macleod. The riding follows the Bow River to Glenmore Trail to Macleod Trail to James McKevitt Rd. The riding is named after the Midnapore neighbourhood. *Calgary Nose Hill: Apart from losing the emdash in the riding name, this riding loses all of its territory north of Stoney Trail and west of Sacree Trail and John Laurie Blvd. However, the riding also gains some territory from Calgary Centre-North. This is the area north of a line following John Laurie Blvd to McKnight Blvd. The riding name most likely comes from Nose Hill Park. *Calgary Shepard: This riding is created out of parts of Calgary East and Calgary Southeast as well as newly annexed parts of the city of Calgary now in Crowfoot. The riding would be bounded on the west by the Bow River and on the north by a line following 26 Ave SE to the CNR to 17 Ave SE. The riding is named after the former hamlet of Shepard, which was annexed by Calgary in 2007. *Calgary Signal Hill: This riding is mostly created out of Calgary West, except for newly annexed parts of the City of Calgary now in Macleod and that part of Calgary Centre west of 37 Ave SW. The riding would contain all of Calgary Southwest south the Bow River. The riding is named after the neighbourhood of the same name. *Calgary Rocky Ridge: This riding is created mostly out of Calgary—Nose Hill except for some new areas contained in newly annexed territories of the City of Calgary now in Wild Rose and the part of Calgary West not contained in Calgary Signal Hill or Calgary Confederation. The riding would consist of all of Calgary—Nose Hill not in the new riding of Calgary Nose Hill.

The group is based in San Francisco, California and derived their name from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Most of the group's early material was released on their own record label named Discos Huelga. Loma Prieta has toured the US, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Japan. They share members with Punch. Their often dark and emotionally charged music blends a range of styles, most prominently screamo and powerviolence. In June 2011, Loma Prieta recorded music for their fourth studio album with Jack Shirley. Their signing to Deathwish Inc. was announced in October 2011, and released their fourth studio album, titled I.V., through their new label on January 17, 2012. The album received positive reviews from AbsolutePunk, Alternative Press, and Exclaim!. Two music videos, for the songs \\"Fly by Night\\" and \\"Trilogy 4 - Momentary\\", have been released to promote I.V. In support of I.V., Loma Prieta toured New Zealand and Australia in January 2012, the United States with Birds in Row in March 2012 and North America with Converge and Git Some in April 2012. The band recorded and released a split with Raein in 2013. On October 2, 2015, Loma Prieta released their fifth full-length studio album titled Self Portrait. The album was described as being a more \\"literal\\" and positive album lyrically as opposed to being more \\"opaque\\" and angry on previous albums, while sonically Loma Prieta incorporates more melody while retaining the same level of hardcore intensity. To promote the album, the band released a single for the album's opening track \\"Love\\" backed with and exclusive B-side titled \\"Trilogy 0 (Debris)\\".

In computer science, real-time scheduling analysis is the evaluation, testing and verification of the scheduling system and the algorithms used in real-time operations. For critical operations, a real-time system must be tested and verified for performance. A real-time scheduling System is composed of the scheduler, clock and the processing hardware elements. In a real-time system, a process or task has schedulability; tasks are accepted by a real-time system and completed as specified by the task deadline depending on the characteristic of the scheduling algorithm. Modeling and evaluation of a real-time scheduling system concern is on the analysis of the algorithm capability to meet a process deadline. A deadline is defined as the time required for a task to be processed. For example, in a real-time scheduling algorithm a deadline could be set to five nano-seconds. In a critical operation the task must be processed in the time specified by the deadline (i.e. five nano-seconds). A task in a real-time system must be completed “neither too early nor too late;..”. A system is said to be unschedulable when tasks can not meet the specified deadlines. A task can be classified as either a periodic or aperiodic process. == Classifications == The criteria of a real-time can be classified as hard, firm or soft. The scheduler set the algorithms for executing tasks according to a specified order. There are multiple mathematical models to represent a scheduling System, most implementations of real-time scheduling algorithm are modeled for the implementation of uniprocessors or multiprocessors configurations. The more challenging scheduling algorithm is found in multiprocessors, it is not always feasible to implement a uniprocessor scheduling algorithm in a multiprocessor. The algorithms used in scheduling analysis “can be classified as pre-emptive or non-pre-emptive\\". A scheduling algorithm defines how tasks are processed by the scheduling system. In general terms, in the algorithm for a real-time scheduling system, each task is assigned a description, deadline and an identifier (indicating priority). The selected scheduling algorithm determines how priorities are assigned to a particular task. A real-time scheduling algorithm can be classified as static or dynamic. For a static scheduler, task priorities are determined before the system runs. A dynamic scheduler determines task priorities as it runs. Tasks are accepted by the hardware elements in a real-time scheduling system from the computing environment and processed in real-time. An output signal indicates the processing status. A task deadline indicates the time set to complete for each task. It is not always possible to meet the required deadline; hence further verification of the scheduling algorithm must be conducted. Two different models can be implemented using a dynamic scheduling algorithm; a task deadline can be assigned according to the task priority (earliest deadline) or a completion time for each task is assigned by subtracting the processing time from the deadline (least laxity). Deadlines and the required task execution time must be understood in advance to ensure the effective use of the processing elements execution times. == Testing and verification == The performance verification and execution of a real-time scheduling algorithm is performed by the analysis of the algorithm execution times. Verification for the performance of a real-time Scheduler will require testing the scheduling algorithm under different test scenarios including the worst-case execution time. These testing scenarios include worst case and unfavorable cases to assess the algorithm performance. The time calculations required for the analysis of scheduling systems requires evaluating the algorithm at the code level. Different methods can be applied to testing a scheduling System in a real-time system. Some methods include: input/output verifications and code analysis. One method is by testing each input condition and performing observations of the outputs. Depending on the number of inputs this approach could result in a lot of effort. Another faster and more economical method is a risk based approach where representative critical inputs are selected for testing. This method is more economical but could result in less than optimal conclusions over the validity of the system if the incorrect approach is used. Retesting requirements after changes to the scheduling System are considered in a case by case basis. Testing and verification of real-time systems should not be limited to input/output and codes verifications but are performed also in running applications using intrusive or non-intrusive methods. ==See also== *Pinwheel scheduling ==References External links == * IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems: http://tcrts.org/ Category:Scheduling (computing) ","title":"Scheduling analysis real-time systems"},{"id":"35967047","text":"Ceromitia lizeri is a moth of the Adelidae family or fairy longhorn moths.

He studied at an American institute in the city and graduated in 1952. While in high school, he became interested in science, primarily mathematics and physics. He studied engineering at the Higher University of San Andrés and won a research scholarship to Germany. He remained in Europe for about ten years to deepen his knowledge of theoretical physics, a branch of physics which applies mathematical models. Following his return to Bolivia in 1967, he promoted the establishment of a major of Basic Sciences at the Higher University of San Andrés. He is the founder of the majors of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry at the school and created the first research laboratory of applied chemistry. At the beginning of the 1970s, Guzmán left his academic career due to the University Revolution of 1970 and Hugo Banzer's military coup. ==Linguistic research== In 1979, Guzmán began to study the algorithmic properties of the syntax of the Aymara language. This research led to the development of the Atamiri System, software, based on the language, that allows multilingual translation of languages simultaneously. In 1985, under the oversight of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, João Clemente Baena Soares, Guzmán presented the first prototype of the Atamiri System in Washington, DC. By this time, it was able to simultaneously translate from English into French, Spanish, and German and from Spanish into French, English, and German. Guzmán gave presentations and seminars in various countries around the world about his investigation of the engineering of language and the application of the Aymara language on Atamiri. He also wrote various publications in respect to the language. Guzmán led a research group called IGRAL, which investigated language engineering. The group began more work on the Atamiri system in 2001 and created Qopuchawi, a multilingual messaging service with translations into 30 different languages. In 2007, he wrote the book Lógica aymara y futurología, in which he referred to an algebraic tool applied to the computation which permits the imagination of a future scenario developed using his study of Aymara. ==Other positions== Between 1989 and 1999 he served as the vice-president of the National Electoral Court of Bolivia.Eighth Conference Of The Association Of Electoral Bodies Of South America, Declaration of Asuncion, Paraguay, 24–25 August 1999 (By and on the Behalf of the National Electoral Courts of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay and the Executive Secretariat (IIHR/CAPEL)). ==Published works== * 500 años America Latina: Ciclo de conferencias, 1973 * El niño vs. el número, Última Hora, 1979 * Problemática lógico-lingüística de la comunicación social con el pueblo aymara, Centro Internacional de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo, 1982 *Logical and linguistic problems of social communication with the aymara people, International Development Research Centre (Estados Unidos), 1985 *Problèmes de logique et de linguistique qui entravent la communication sociale avec le peuple aymara, Centre de recherches pour le développement international (Canada), 1985 *Lógica aymara y futurología, Imprenta \\"Santin\\" Offset Color, 2007 ==References== Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:Bolivian scientists Category:Linguists Category:People from La Paz ","title":"Iván Guzmán de Rojas"},{"id":"35967179","text":"Pascal Antoine Fiorella or Pasquale Antonio, comte Fiorella (7 February 1752 - 3 March 1818) became a French general officer in the French Revolutionary Wars and led a brigade during Napoleon Bonaparte's famous campaign in Italy in 1796. A Corsican by birth, he joined the French Royal Army as a volunteer in 1770 and was quickly appointed an officer. When the French Revolution broke out, he was a captain. Elected lieutenant colonel of a volunteer battalion, he fought with the Army of the Alps. Transferred to the Army of Italy, he assumed command of the 46th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade in February 1794. He fought under André Masséna at Saorgio where he was wounded. In September 1794 he earned promotion to general of brigade and led the army reserve. When Bonaparte took command of the Army of Italy in the spring of 1796 Fiorella led a brigade in Jean-Mathieu-Philibert Sérurier's division. He fought at Mondovì in April 1796. During the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796, he took command of Sérurier's division and led it to attack the Austrian left rear. This maneuver resulted in an important French victory. During the Arcola campaign in November 1796, he led his troops at Calliano and was captured at Rivoli. Beginning in 1797, he saw service as a division commander in the armies of the French-allied Italian states. In 1799 he was forced to surrender Turin to the Austrians. He blockaded Venice in 1805 and was involved in suppressing the Tyrolean Rebellion in 1809. Despite joining Napoleon for the Hundred Days, he managed to secure retirement with the rank of division commander in 1817. He died the next year in Ajaccio.

Working in the tropical waters of Africa and South America, Lowe-McConnell was a pioneer in the study of tropical fish ecology and an early adopter of the use of scuba diving for scientific research. Lowe-McConnell was educated at Howell's School in Denbigh, Wales before receiving B.S., M.Sc., and D.Sc. degrees from the University of Liverpool. Following World War II, in 1945, Lowe-McConnell conducted a survey of tilapia fisheries in the southern part of Lake Nyasa, continuing the previous survey done in 1939 by Ethelwynn Trewavas, Kate Ricardo Bertram, and John Borley. Lowe-McConnell received no support from any fisheries research organisations for this survey and relied heavily on local fishermen for assistance with her research. As a result of these studies, Lowe-McConnell produced a valuable account of the tilapia fishery that formed a basis for subsequent investigation into Malawian cichlids. In the survey, Lowe-McConnell identified five tilapiine species, as well as studied other economically viable fish, including Labeo mesops. In 1948, Lowe-McConnell studied as a Research Officer in the British Overseas Research Service on the Ugandan shores of Lake Victoria. Here, she helped found the East African Fisheries Research Organisation and briefly served as its Acting Director. Her research again focused again on tilapia as a potential fisheries species. During this time, she assisted many researchers, including Hugh Cott on his crocodile studies and Humphry Greenwood in his research on haplochromine cichlids. Lowe-McConnell's research during this period served as a foundation for later assessments of the impact fishing and other human activities have on food fishes. After Rosemary married the geologist Richard McConnell on December 31, 1953, she was required to resign from the British Colonial Service due to the organization's marriage bar. This rule prevented the permanent employment of a married woman in the British Public Service. Soon after their wedding, the McConnells moved to the Bechuanaland Protectorate, where their joint research focused on Botswanan natural history. During this time, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as the ichthyologist on the R.V. Cape St Mary to conduct marine fieldwork on the unexplored Guiana shelf. She also developed her Okavango fish collection, now housed in the Natural History Museum, London. In 1955, she described four new species and subspecies of tilapias in Lake Jipe and the Pangani River. In 1957, Richard became director of the Geological Survey in British Guiana and Lowe-McConnell provided research support. She was also hired by the Guiana Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to conduct fish surveys in unstudied areas, which provided a foundation for studying the diverse and ecologically complex Rupununi fish communities. Her 1959 paper on the differences between tilapia species served as the basis for Ethelwynn Trewavas' division of tilapiine fish genera. When Richard retired in 1962, the McConnells moved back to England, where Lowe- McConnell joined the Natural History Museum, London as an Associate. While at the museum, Lowe-McConnell worked closely with Ethelwynn Trewavase on their extensive collections and global research. In 1968, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as ichthyologist on the Royal Society of London/Royal Geographical Society Xavantina Cachimbo Expedition to northeastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. She traveled to Gatun Lake in Panamá in 1979 to assist Thomas Zaret in studying the impact of an introduced cichla species. Lowe-McConnell was widely known as a leader in her field and engaged with numerous international conferences, projects, and publications. Her work was requested by global organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Development Programme, and the International Center of Living Aquatic Resources Management. During the 1980s through the early 2000s, Lowe-McConnell worked with Great Lakes research projects and governance bodies, including the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization. In 1997, Lowe-McConnell was awarded the Linnean Medal of Zoology by the Linnean Society of London. Lowe-McConnell continued to remain active in her field until her death on 22 December 2014 at St. George’s Park in Ditchling, England. ==Selected works== Lowe-McConnell was authored or co-author for over 80 publications and edited or co-edited three books. * Notes on the fishes found in Georgetown fish markets and their seasonal fluctuations (1962) * Man-made Lakes (1966) * Speciation in tropical environments, with Ernst Mayr (1969) * Fish communities in tropical freshwaters: their distribution, ecology and evolution (1975) * Ecology of fishes in tropical waters (1977) * The functioning of freshwater ecosystems, with E.

Nelson was inspired to create the annual concert after his participation in the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion, that was hosted at Hurlbut Ranch in Dripping Springs, Texas. As part of the lineup, Nelson performed on the third day. The event failed to meet the expected attendance due to the concert being poorly promoted. Interested in the concept, Nelson decided to host the inaugural Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic in the same place, as it was already prepared to host a concert. The success of the event led to other concerts. During the late 1970s, the bad reputation of the concert for recurrent problems with safety of the audience made it difficult to find venues. During the 1980s the security improved, and the event recovered the trust of the potential venues. ==HistoryDripping Springs Reunion=== (L-R) Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings at Dripping Springs reunion Willie Nelson was inspired to start a yearly festival by the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion, where he was a part of the lineup. In 1971, four music promoters from Dallas, Texas, decided to create a massive music festival for country music audiences. Edward Allen, Michael McFarland, Don Snyder and Peter Smith, chose the Hurlbut Ranch, owned by James Hurlbut in Dripping Springs, Texas to be the place for the festival. After working on the grounds for months to prepare the site, the festival was set to last three days, between March 17-19, 1972. The lineup included Earl Scruggs, Hank Snow, Sonny James, Tom T. Hall, Tex Ritter, Roy Acuff, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. Due to the lack of funds, the event was poorly promoted. The expected total attendance was 180,000 to 225,000 for the three days, but it failed to reach 40,000. Security was provided by 123 men on foot, 40 perimeter horse riders, highway patrolmen and two helicopters. According to Nelson's biographer Joe Nick Patoski, the concert \\"helped spark the rise of progressive country music and recognition of Austin as a music hub\\". ===The picnic=== In 1973, Willie Nelson's first 4th of July picnic took place in the same ranch. Nelson selected the place because it was already prepared to hold a concert. The event attracted an estimated attendance of 40,000, and became an annual festival. Before the concert, the Texas Senate Resolution 687 proclaimed July 4, 1975 as \\"Willie Nelson Day\\". The organization provided only few portable toilets, while trash was left around the concert site and the town. The event was qualified as \\"moral pollution\\" by the local residents. For the bad organization of the concert, Nelson was fined US$1,000 for violating the Texas Mass Gatherings Act. During the late 1970s bad reputation of the concert often led to problems to find a venue. In 1976, the planned three-day concert had an estimated attendance of 80,000, the largest in the history of the picnic. The concert ended on July 5 after the rain shorted the PA system. An attendant drowned while four were stabbed. There were 140 arrests, four kidnappings, and three reported rapes. Nelson was sued by the ranch owner, the ambulance service and two attendants. During the 1980s the security was reinforced in the picnics, improving the reputation of the event. The outdoors were fenced and the number of negative incidents reduced. During the 1990s the picnic was often held in Luckenbach, Texas, while in the 2000s the recurrent location was Billy Bob's Texas, at the Fort Worth Stockyards. No picnic was held in 2020. ==List of concerts== Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic has been hosted on the following occasions: { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - Year City Venue Lineup included Notes - 1973 Dripping Springs, Texas Hurlbut Ranch Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, John Prine, Doug Sahm and Tom T.

The gold rush led to the formation of the first towns in the archipelago and fueled economic growth in Punta Arenas. After the gold rush was over, most gold diggers left the archipelago, while the remaining settlers engaged in sheep farming and fishing. Indigenous Selk'nam populations declined sharply during the rush. ==First discoveries== In 1879 an expedition led by Chilean Navy officer Ramón Serrano Montaner discovered gold in some watercourses of western Tierra del Fuego.Martinic Beros, Mateo. Crónica de las Tierras del Canal Beagle. 1973. Editorial Francisco de Aguirre S.A. pp. 55–65Bascopé Julio, Joaquín. Sentidos Coloniales I. El Oro y la Vida Salvaje en Tierra del Fuego, 1880–1914. Magallania However the gold rush was triggered only in 1884. That year the French steamship Arctique ran aground on the northern coast of Cape Virgenes. An expedition sent for its rescue discovered gold in a place called Zanja a Pique. When news reached Punta Arenas many inhabitants left for Zanja a Pique. From Punta Arenas the news then reached Buenos Aires. ==The rush and Julius Popper expedition== In Buenos Aires the press compared the gold findings to the rushes of Australia and California. In that city many companies were formed for the purpose of extracting gold. Julio Popper, a mining engineer, was contracted by one of these companies in Buenos Aires. Popper then proceeded to recruit a number of Dalmatians from the many immigrants that lived in Buenos Aires those years. With these workers Popper set out to exploit the findings of El Páramo in San Sebastián Bay. Another camp was established in Sloggett Bay at the southern coast of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. The gold rush reached the Chilean islands south of Beagle Channel so that by 1893 over one thousand men, most of them Dalmatians, lived there. However, by 1894 gold extraction begun to decline in these islands and deposits became gradually depleted.Martinic Beros, Mateo. Crónica de las Tierras del Canal Beagle. 1973. Editorial Francisco de Aguirre S.A. pp. 65–75 A number of enterprises formed in the 1900s to extract gold from the islands south of Beagle Channel ended with meager results. ==Legacy== During his work in Tierra del Fuego Popper was involved in the killings of native Selk'nam, which came later to be known as the Selk'nam genocide.Odone, C. and M.Palma, 'La muerte exhibida fotografias de Julius Popper en Tierra del Fuego', in Mason and Odone, eds, 12 miradas.

This created even a shortage of women among Fuegian tribes. The capture and control of women in the main island worsened conflicts between rival groups. There are also reports of trade of women during deals between men. By 1894 Porvenir consisted of five houses, two of them liquor stores and a third one a brothel. The Dalmatians involved in the gold rush gradually left mining activities either to return to Dalmatia or Buenos Aires or establish themselves in Punta Arenas. The gold rush caused an improvement in the geographical knowledge of the poorly known islands south of Beagle Channel and linked them to Punta Arenas. Gold extracted in Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego generally left the zone without improving much the economy of southernmost South America, but in the case of the gold extracted in from the islands south of Beagle Channel much of it ended up in Punta Arenas where it fueled economic growth. ==See also== * Chilean silver rush * Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina * German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue ==References== Category:History of Tierra del Fuego Category:History of mining in Chile Category:Mining in Argentina Category:Gold rushes Category:History of Magallanes Region Category:1880s in Chile Category:1880s in Argentina Category:1890s in Chile Category:1890s in Argentina Category:1900s in Chile Category:1900s in Argentina Category:1883 in Chile Category:1883 in Argentina Category:1906 in Chile Category:1906 in Argentina ","title":"Tierra del Fuego gold rush"},{"id":"35967554","text":"Street children or orphans in some Eastern European countries face problems such as malnutrition, HIV, lack of resources, victimization though child sex tourism, social stigmatization and discrimination. ==Overview== Children living on the streets often come from a background of poverty and abuse, and a normal childhood is replaced by violence and crime. These children live in tunnels, garbage containers, and basements. In the winter, they take comfort from hot water pipes whose steam provides them with much needed warmth. However, as many of the Eastern European countries joined the European Union, they were required to deal with the situation of street children and orphans; and the situation has improved in many of these countries. Unemployment and the extremes of income inequality are some of the causes behind the phenomenon of street children in countries like Russia, Romania and Ukraine. == Romania == The phenomenon of street children in Romania must be understood within the local historical context. Under Nicolae Ceauşescu, both abortion and contraception were forbidden, leading to a rise in birth rates. In October 1966, the Decree 770 was enacted, which banned abortion, except in exceptional cases. There was an increase in the number of births in the following years, especially in the 1967-1968 period, which resulted in many children being abandoned, and these children were joined in the orphanages by disabled and mentally ill people. Together, these vulnerable groups were subjected to institutionalised neglect and abuse, including physical and sexual abuse and use of drugs to control behaviour. After the fall of communism (December 1989), the conditions which existed in the orphanages were leaked internationally, and created outrage. A news report on the American newsmagazine 20/20, which first aired on 5 October 1990, was the first to show the conditions in full detail on television. The 1990s was a difficult transition period, and it is during this period that the number of street children was very high. Some ran away or were thrown out of orphanages or abusive homes, and were often seen begging or roaming around the Bucharest Metro; this situation was presented in a documentary called Children Underground, which depicted the life of Romanian street children in 2001. In the 21st century, Romania has taken drastic steps to stop the phenomenons of mistreatment and exploitation of children and child abandonment, and to improve the situation of orphans, especially as it prepared itself to become a member of the European Union. As such, the number of street children declined markedly. Around 2004, about 500 children lived permanently in the streets of Bucharest, while other children (less than 1,500) worked in the streets during the day, but returned home to their families in the evenings - making a total of 2,000 street children in Romania's capital. Child begging is a problem that Romania has taken many steps to prevent, including through creating criminal offenses relating to it under the Penal Code, as well as through other civil sanctions that can be applied to parents. Parents who encourage or force children under 18 to beg or to prostitute themselves can face criminal charges. With regard to the right to education of children, parents/legal guardians are obligated to ensure the child gets an education; failure to do so can result in criminal prosecution (Art. 380 Preventing access to compulsory public education). Also, according to Art 33 of Law No. 61/1991 penalising the violation of public order and social standards, parents/legal guardians who fail to take \\"adequate measures\\" to prevent children under 16 from engaging in vagrancy, begging, or prostitution are liable to pay a contraventional fine (Law No. 61/1991 on contraventions applies only in cases when the deed of the guilty party does not constitute a criminal offense). == Moldova == Some children in Moldova face abandonment by parents. In Moldova, there are now programs aimed at rehabilitating former street children. == Ukraine == In Ukraine, \\"a social orphan\\" is a child with one or more living parents who are unable to care for him. The Centre of Motherhood and Childhood, a project supported by UNICEF and its partners in Kherson, provide mothers in poverty with clothes for their children, a place to live, and medical care, so that mothers may avoid abandoning children due to lack of necessary resources. Homeless children in Ukraine typically sleep in manholes or basements, under bridges or on top of hot water pipes. There are up to 4,000 homeless children that live in squalor on the streets of Odessa. Homeless young people often inhale glue or inject cold and flu medicine as ways of taking drugs. Young people turn to inhaling glue as the fumes suppress feelings of cold and hunger and produce auditory and visual hallucinations. Violence, sexual abuse and drug addiction are common among homeless children in Odessa. Many homeless children in Odessa are at high risk for HIV due to the large number sharing needles and engaging in unsafe sex. The base rate of infection is higher than the 1% of the population that epidemiologists say is a critical threshold. The outreach teams claim that close to 1 in 10 of all children tested turned out to be HIV positive UNICEF is currently implementing assistance to these homeless children most notably ‘The Way Home’ which sends an outreach team to visit street children each week. The outreach team provides street children with clean water, food and basic first aid. During the summer, they set up an outdoor camp, giving youths a chance to enjoy activities such as swimming and playing. == Russia == According to the Department of Social Population Protection in Moscow says the city has 4,142 children who are beznadzorniye, neglected, or besprizorniki, homeless. Many Russian children still live outside of the family unit, despite progress in developing family-style alternatives to institutionalization; 156,000 children are currently housed in orphanages or boarding homes. MSF, an international medical organization also known as Doctors Without Borders, which has worked with them since 2003, estimates that there are about 2,000. Numbers from MSF reveal that fifty percent of the street children consume alcohol regularly; 77.8 percent smoke cigarettes; 27.4 percent inhale glue. About one-thirduse butorphanol, which is classified as a prescription drug but loosely regulated, and are freely able to purchase it at pharmacies. Moscow's department for homeless and neglected children is currently trying to decrease the number of children living on the street. Police bring street children to hospitals where for one to two weeks they undergo examinations and receive medical care. They are then “placed in priyuty, shelters that provide medical services, education and rehabilitation, and where children are received regardless of nationality and the legal documents they hold. Each child’s length of stay depends on what rehabilitative measures are needed. Street children in Russia often miss out on proper education due to the difficulties of living on the streets. Specialists claim that it is possible to reverse homelessness for children if they have been living on the street for less than six months though it is harder if it’s longer since they may have already become used to finding their own ways to survive UNICEF partner Samu Social currently provides emergency assistance, food and water for street children in Moscow. Samu Social sees its mission “as a kind of link in the chain from emergency help for such young people to their social rehabilitation” == References == Eastern Europe Category:Child poverty Category:Street children Category:Childhood in Europe ","title":"Street children in Eastern Europe"},{"id":"35967572","text":"Ed Binney (April 19, 1864 – unknown) was an African American boxer who was the colored middleweight champion of the World in the Gay Nineties.

In comparison to other aspects of war, war termination has received relatively less study. According to Fred Charles Iklé, \\"[H]istorians, foreign affairs experts, and military strategists have devoted far more thought to the question of how and why wars begin.\\"Iklé, p.vii This idea is echoed by Gideon Rose, who writes: > For all endgames' drama and historical importance, however, they have > received far less attention than other phases of war. A few books look at > the ends of individual wars, and there is a small academic literature on > what political scientists call war termination. But in general, endgames > have been as neglected by scholars as they have been by policymakers.Rose, > p.4 In studying the factors which constrain and shape the actions of decision- makers and strategists in ending wars, there are three major schools of thought: #Realism, which considers that a nation's foreign policy is primarily concerned with security issues, and sees international power politics as the most important factor; #Those who see internal factors, such as political ideology and domestic politics, as the primary factors; #Those who consider psychological factors, such as the personalities of a country's leaders, and the society's experiences in the most recent war, as most instrumental in shaping those leaders' actions in the endgame.Rose, p.5 Other theories, such as neoclassical realism, combine these factors to one extent or another. ==Theories of war termination== War termination is coercive bargaining Slantchev, 2003 and it only comes to an end when two interacting sides can agree upon their relative strength and credibly commit to a settlement (Stanley and Sawyer, 2009). According to Slantchev's Principle of Convergence, in order for that to happen, both players must have enough information about the other's strengths and about what they are willing to concede. Once expectations about the outcomes of war converge sufficiently, a bargaining space is created so that a negotiated settlement can be reached. The battlefield is one of the main sources of information about the enemy, says Slantchev. It is in warfare that one discovers how far belligerents are willing to go and what chances one has against the other. Players will delay agreement until they have enough information about their prospects, thus avoiding settling on bad terms. Once they learn enough about the other, then warfare becomes irrelevant. According to the author, another important way of gathering information about the opponent is the way he behaves on the negotiation table. \\"Since readiness to talk can be so revealing, it may provide a good rationale for delaying explicit diplomacy until after an armistice. (…) For example, making an unreasonable demand signals strength but defeat in battle reveals weakness.\\" Provided with the new information acquired from the battlefield and from the negotiation table, players are then capable of adjusting their expectations about the outcomes of war. Once they are convergent enough, the bargaining space is created and conflict can come to an end through a settlement. The adjustment of expectations, however, can also come from a change in the foreign policy leadership itself, or as Stanley and Sawyer (2009) would say, from domestic coalition shifts. A \\"domestic governing coalition\\" is \\"the elite foreign policy decision-making group in each belligerent government,\\" that is, the actors who have the power to decide whether a country engages in war or if it ends it. A \\"domestic coalition shift,\\" as the authors define it, is either \\"(1) a consequential change in the identity of the decision makers or (2) a substantive change in the type of government.\\" In other words, domestic aspects of the players, such as their type of regime and their leaders' characteristics, can affect war termination. Having the domestic coalition in mind, according to The Equifinality of War theory, there can be three kinds of obstacles to peace. The first one is a matter of preference: if decision makers do not want to stop the war, be it for personal stakes, reputation, or security (when the costs of not engaging are higher than going to war, for instance), there is no place for negotiation.Stanley and Sawyer, 2009 The second obstacle has to do with information: if leaders receive poor quality information or if there is a problem in the way this information is interpreted, they are not aware of the fact that they should end the war. And finally, there is the risk of entrapment, which can be defined as decision makers wanting to end the war, having all the information needed to do so, but not being able to do it, due to \\"internal or external hawkish constituencies.\\" The more entrenched war becomes, the harder it is to end it. If war termination demands that at least one side changes its expectations about the outcomes of war, then a domestic coalition shift may accelerate this process and overcome the obstacles to peace, say Stanley and Sawyer. \\"The coalition shift allows different political actors — with different interests, assessments of the war, and constituencies — to take power.\\" The Principle of Convergence, the Equifinality of War and every other theory of war termination make one assumption: that at some point, a negotiation with the enemy is going to be possible, acceptable and, in the end, desirable. Regardless of the information gathered in warfare, there is eventually going to be room for diplomacy. Negotiation is paramount for the achievement of peace as defined by Clausewitz: the acceptance by the belligerents that the war results are final, not something that can be changed by violence when more favourable circumstances appear.Clausewitz, 1832 ==See also== *Chess endgame *Grand strategy *Jus post bellum ==References== Notes Bibliography *Iklé, Fred Charles.

The Little Sugar Creek Greenway will be a key part of the Carolina Thread Trail, a regionwide network of trails that will ultimately pass through 15 counties.^ Charlotte Observer: Greenways offer a scenic route through town, by Corey Inscoe, July 25, 2012 Greenways are narrow strips of land, planted and managed to provide both human recreation and wildlife habitat. Greenways along streams, such as Little Sugar Creek, improve water quality and help control flooding. There are about 37 miles of developed greenways in Mecklenburg County, of which this is only one.Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation: Greenways The two urban sections of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway were championed by Central Piedmont Community College president Tony Zeiss and together provide five unbroken miles of paved walkway from East 7th Street southward to Brandywine Road.Map of Little Sugar Creek Greenway from E 7th Street to E Morehead Street, PDF file ==HistoryLittle Sugar Creek=== Unlike many large cities, Charlotte is not sited on or near a sea, lake, or significant river; its hydrogeography is based on small streams and creeks, Little Sugar Creek being perhaps the most prominent. The name of Little Sugar Creek (which has also been called Sugar Creek, a name that has also been applied to what is now called Irwin Creek) derives from the Sugaree tribe indigenous to the area. Running through some of Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods, over time parts of Little Sugar Creek became hidden by houses, factories, parking lots, riprap, highways, and culverts. The stream also became very polluted by runoff from factories and sewers, and litter. Controlled flooding on Little Sugar Creek in December 2015. In the 1990s floods caused extensive damage along the Sugar Creek watershed. As recently as 2000 Little Sugar Creek was \\"the most polluted stream in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, a fetid stew of runoff and industrial waste trickling beneath parking decks and buildings on the fringe of downtown.\\" Businesses dumped waste straight into its water, the fumes so noxious they were said to peel the paint off nearby buildings. Moreover, flood-prone buildings had to be razed, and much of the stream was covered by concrete which had to be removed.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services: Little Sugar Creek: Charlottetowne Ave to Pearl Park Way (Midtown) The pollution problem began to be solved when straight-piping of wastes was outlawed in 1998; nevertheless Little Sugar Creek Greenway became the most expensive stream restoration in Mecklenburg county. ===The Greenway=== In 1968 Charlotte city council member Jerry Tuttle, inspired by San Antonio's River Walk, proposed an urban \\"Charlotte waterfront\\" on Sugar Creek.

A master plan was created in 1980 involving 20 creeks and streams. The final report was based on the graduate thesis for Joan Sigmon, a geography major at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission: Greenways and a Return to Landscape Ideology The idea of a comprehensive greenway system was also promoted by Mecklenburg county commissioner Tom Ray who authored the concept known as \\"Sugar Creek Projection 70\\".Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation: History of Sugar Creek Demographics provided further impetus for preserving green space in the center city. Bucking the general trend, Charlotte experienced growth in the central core while other cities were losing population to the suburbs. As a result \\"The Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Department embarked on an ambitious update to its earlier 1980 and 1991 Greenways Plans to not only extend and create new greenway corridors, but also improve established corridors.\\"American Planning Association, City Parks Forum: Little Sugar Creek Greenway Finally, in 1999 a bond plan was approved; the money was used to buy property along the stream bed, begin construction or paved walkways, restore wetlands, build water gardens, and generally launch a major stream restoration project. In the end, the urban section of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway cost $43 million. Although the master plan remained the guideline, little was done until 2000 when a 10-year growth plan was formulated.Charlotte Observer: Sweet resurrection for Charlotte’s Little Sugar Creek, by Bruce Henderson, March 18, 2012 The North Carolina Department of Transportation announced the completion of the Charlotte portion of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway at a celebration on April 24, 2012. ==Finished sections== The completed part of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway can be divided into four sections going downstream from north to south.Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation: Open Greenways ;Cordelia Park to 12th Street: Paved walkway follows Little Sugar Creek and extends for .95 miles from Parkwood Avenue on the southern border of Cordelia Park to Greenway Crescent Lane and East 12th street just south of Alexander Street Park. Gulf Coast spiny softshell turtles can be seen in this part of the creek. This section does not currently connect with the rest of the greenway. Stream restoration on urban Section of the Greenway ;East 7th Street to Morehead Street: The \\"urban section\\" of the greenway runs for 1.29 miles along Sugar Creek in uptown Charlotte and was completed in April 2012.Charlotte Observer: Little Sugar Creek Greenway section is done, by April Bethea, April 20, 2012 It begins at 7th Street, goes southward past Central Piedmont Community College,Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services: Little Sugar Creek - 7th St. to Elizabeth Ave. Project passes through Thompson Park, connects to the showpiece Midtown Park at Pearl Park Way,Charlotte Observer: New park to open soon in Midtown, by Karen Sullivan, January 29, 2012 and ends at the Morehead Street underpass. It is the most highly developed section of the greenway and incorporates paved walkways, stonework walls and plazas, fountains, dining, many newly planted trees, large decorative rocks, gardens, public event areas, numerous statues and sculptures, and a clock tower.Little Sugar Creek Greenway: East 7th Street to Morehead Street There are overpasses and underpasses to facilitate unimpeded walking and biking.The Charlotte Observer: SouthPark Magazine: The Great Outdoors, by Sam Boykin, November 22, 2010 Included also are the usual park amenities such as benches, bike racks, restrooms, decorative lampposts, and a snack stand.WBTV: Statue of Captain James Jack to be Unveiled, May 19, 2010 Liz Hair Nature Walk ;Morehead Street to Brandywine Road: This section connects with the urban section through the Morehead Street underpass. The first part going south is a straight section directly on the banks of Sugar Creek known as the Liz Hair Nature Walk, completed in September 2005.Little Sugar Creek Greenway: Liz Hair Project It extends for .65 miles from Morehead Street to East Boulevard and is adjacent to the Carolinas Medical Center complex. The next section runs from East Boulevard to Princeton Avenue, passing by the Charlotte Nature Museum and through Freedom Park. Next is a so-called overland connector which utilizes existing sidewalk for .42 miles along Jameston Drive. The paved part of the greenway resumes again at Hillside Avenue and continues on to Brandywine Road, ending behind the Park Road Shopping Center. This last section features wetland filtration ponds and explanatory signage.Little Sugar Creek Greenway: Morehead Street to Brandywine Road Greenway trail in Huntingtowne Farms Park ;Huntingtowne Farms Park Section: The southernmost existing section of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway is .79 miles long and is almost entirely contained in Huntingtowne Farms Park. It is more than 5 miles from the rest of the completed greenway. This part of the greenway known as a haven for hawks and barred owls.Little Sugar Creek Greenway: Huntingtowne Farms Park ==Reviews== Gene Conti of the North Carolina Department of Transportation praised the greenway \\"for providing Charlotteans with an accessible place to run, walk and bike,\\" and called it \\"an example for the rest of the state.\\"NCDOT, Charlotte Celebrate Completion of Little Sugar Creek Greenway, April 24, 2012 The Charlotte Observer called the Little Sugar Creek Greenway a \\"sweet resurrection\\". Fish have returned to the stream; and ducks, Canada geese, and herons are often seen. The mixture of natural restoration and urban redevelopment draws \\"gushing praise\\"—although some people, such as Mecklenburg County commissioner Bill James, have criticized the project for its cost. James compared the project to proposed uptown baseball stadiums, asserting that the county overpaid for land for stream restoration and helped \\"well- connected developers\\". However, one business owner said that sites along the greenway offer the \\"best view of Charlotte from Charlotte—a view that will remain unencumbered forever.\\" Despite being a vast improvement over the toxic pollution of the past, trash–particularly plastic bags-remains a problem along Sugar Creek. In 2015 Richard Maschal of the Charlotte Observer reported, \\"The creek is festooned with such detritus, particularly near the bridges spanning Morehead Street and Kings Drive.\\"Charlotte Observer: Trash still a problem at Little Sugar Creek Greenway, by Richard Maschal, January 5, 2015 ==Awards== * 2012 Best Place to Get Back to Nature, Creative Loafing: Best of CharlotteCreative Loafing, Best of Charlotte 2012 * 2011 Best Use of Tax Money, Creative Loafing: Best of CharlotteCreative Loafing, Best of Charlotte, 2011 ==Activities== * Since 2011, the annual Kings Drive Art Walk has been held on the greenway between Midtown Park and Morehead Street.

With his skating partner, Ashley Cain, he is the 2019 U.S. Champion, 2018 Four Continents silver medalist, 2016 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb bronze medalist, and 2017 U.S. national bronze medalist. == Personal life == Timothy LeDuc was born May 4, 1990 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He became interested in figure skating after watching the 2002 Olympics, and started taking figure skating lessons through the Learn to Skate program. LeDuc is the first openly queer skater to win the Pairs Title at the US National Championships. == Career  Single skating === LeDuc began learning to skate when he was 12 years old and started private lessons two years later. He placed 7th in the novice men's category at the 2008 U.S. Championships. === Early partnerships === Competing in novice pairs, LeDuc placed tenth with Lauren Gifford at the 2010 U.S. Championships. With Cassie Andrews, he won the junior bronze medal at the 2011 U.S. Championships and finished ninth at the 2011 World Junior Championships in Gangneung, South Korea. Moving up to the senior level the following season, they placed eleventh at the 2012 U.S. Championships. LeDuc teamed up with DeeDee Leng in June 2012. After placing ninth at the 2013 U.S. Championships, they were assigned to the International Challenge Cup, where they finished fifth. The following season, the pair placed sixth at the 2013 International Cup of Nice and seventh at the 2014 U.S. Championships. After their partnership ended in 2014, LeDuc skated with his sister for two years in Willy Bietak ice shows on Royal Caribbean cruise ships. After completing his contract in March 2016, he decided to return to competition. === Partnership with Cain === Following a suggestion from U.S. Figure Skating's Mitch Moyer, LeDuc tried out with Ashley Cain in May 2016. On May 23, 2016, they confirmed their intention to compete together. The pair is coached by her father, Peter Cain, in Euless, Texas.  2016–17 season  Cain/LeDuc received three Challenger Series assignments in the 2016-2017 season. After placing fourth at the 2016 Nebelhorn Trophy and 2016 Finlandia Trophy, they were awarded the bronze medal at the 2016 Golden Spin of Zagreb, where they upgraded their twist from a double to a triple. Cain stated, \\"We just started rotating it days before we left for that competition.\\" At the 2017 US Figure Skating Championships, they placed third. They placed ninth at the 2017 Four Continents Championships.  2017–18 season  Cain/LeDuc started the 2017-2018 season with a fourth place finish at the 2017 Lombardia Trophy in mid-September. They placed seventh at the 2017 Nebelhorn Trophy in late September. At their first Grand Prix event, the 2017 Cup of China, they placed sixth. They placed third at the 2018 US Figure Skating Championships. They placed second at the 2018 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships and earned their first medal at a senior ISU Championship.  2018–19 season  At 2018 US International Figure Skating Classic, Cain/LeDuc placed first overall with a score of 173.05. At the 2018 Ondrej Nepela Trophy, they placed first overall with a score of 181.56. At their first Grand Prix event of the season, 2018 Skate America, they placed third overall with a score of 175.05. At 2018 Rostelecom Cup, Cain/LeDuc placed sixth with a score of 170.29. Following the Grand Prix, Cain/LeDuc competed in a third Challenger event, the Golden Spin of Zagreb. Second after the short program, the two placed fifth in the free skate following two falls. The second fall involved Cain being dropped on her head in the process of exiting a lift, seemingly being knocked unconscious briefly, before getting up and completing the program. She was subsequently taken to hospital. There was considerable controversy amongst commentators that the referee had not halted the performance. Cain was subsequently diagnosed with a concussion. At the 2019 U.S. Championships, Cain/LeDuc won their first US pairs title after placing second in the short program and first in the free skate. Speaking afterward, LeDuc credited Cain's recovery, saying it \\"was like building a castle, one brick at a time. It’s been so inspiring for me to watch her push through this and give me strength. We are always trying to progress as a team, and this season, we took it very seriously and we wanted to step it up.\\" As national champions, Cain/LeDuc were assigned to compete at the 2019 Four Continents Championships in early February and as America's sole pairs team at the 2019 World Championships in Saitama, Japan. Cain/LeDuc finished fourth at the Four Continents Championships, the highest placement for an American team, after finishing fourth in both segments. Cain had struggled in the practice sessions beforehand and felt dehydrated, but recovered and said she was satisfied with how they had performed. At the World Championships, their first, Cain/Le Duc placed ninth. Le Duc described the season as a \\"rollercoaster\\", given the issues with injuries, while Cain expressed pleasure at having earned a second pairs spot for the United States at the following year's World Championships. Cain/Le Duc concluded their season as part of the gold medal-winning Team USA at the 2019 World Team Trophy.  2019–20 season  Cain-Gribble/LeDuc began the season at the 2019 CS U.S. Classic, where they won gold, defeating reigning World silver medalists Evgenia Tarasova / Vladimir Morozov. They were considered one of the favourites for the gold medal at their first Grand Prix assignment of the year, the 2019 Skate America. They placed third in the short program after Cain-Gribble fell on their throw triple Lutz. In the free skate, they had a second throw Lutz fall, as well as a popped side-by-side jump attempt and an aborted lift, which dropped them to fifth place overall. At their second Grand Prix, the 2019 Internationaux de France, Cain-Gribble again fell on their throw Lutz in the short program, putting them fourth after that segment. They finally landed the throw Lutz in the free skate, but remained in fourth place overall after Cain- Gribble fell on their side-by-side triple Salchow attempt. Competing at the 2020 U.S. Championships, Cain-Gribble/LeDuc were fourth in the short program after she two-footed the landing of their throw Lutz and an error resulted in their death spiral element being completely invalidated. Struggling with the quality of elements in the free skate, they remained in fourth place overall, winning the pewter medal. LeDuc remarked \\"it just wasn't in the cards for us today. Despite their fourth-place at the national championships, Cain/LeDuc were assigned to compete at the World Championships in Montreal, but these were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. == Programs  With Cain === {   - !

Kimball was the oldest son of Spencer W. Kimball and his wife Camilla Eyring Kimball. He was born in Thatcher, Arizona and raised in Safford, Arizona. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Arizona and then served in the United States navy on the Admiral's staff as a Japanese interpreter during World War II. He received his law degree from the University of Utah. He was later a Rhodes Scholar studying at Lincoln College, Oxford. He received his SJD from the University of Wisconsin- Madison.http://www.law.wisc.edu/current/In_the_Media/Emeritus_Dean_Spencer_Kimball_Di_2003-11-04 He later served on the law faculty there and was the youngest dean of law in the history of the University of Utah. He was also on the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School and the University of Chicago. At the University of Chicago he was the Seymour Logan Professor of Law. Kimball helped to established an American Civil Liberties Union chapter in Utah. Although he was widely associated with the LDS Church because of his father's prominent leadership positions, Kimball ceased his activity with the church while in his thirties and remained irreligious for the rest of his life. Kimball never desired to formally leave the LDS church, and took pride in his Mormon pioneer heritage and his father's position as church president, but gradually stopped believing in the divine claims of the LDS church and all other religions. ==References== *\\"Spencer L.

Tag rugby was developed from the sport Rugby league. Until recently, tag was not widely known or played locally in Tonga. The sport was introduced approximately in 2007, but lack of supervision and development throughout the Kingdom of Tonga caused participation in the sport to decline.

His tenure is notable for his redesign of the Great Seal of the State of Illinois. ==Background== Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Tyndale moved to Belleville, Illinois in 1833 and worked in the mercantile business. He moved back to Philadelphia and worked in the mercantile business with his father. In 1845, he moved to Peoria, Illinois and studied to be a civil engineer. In 1857, Tyndale was elected County Surveyor of St. Clair County, Illinois. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Tyndale postmaster of Belleville, Illinois in 1861. From 1865 to 1869, Tyndale served as Illinois Secretary of State, as a Republican. After Tyndale left office, he stayed in Springfield, Illinois and worked for Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad doing survey.

Allensworth, Munsell Publishing Company: 1905, Biographical Sketch of Sharon Tyndale, pg. 532 ==Seal of the State of Illinois== In 1867, Tyndale himself requested that the Illinois General Assembly authorize a redesign of the seal, with one key suggestion, that the words of the motto (State Sovereignty, National Union) be reversed (to National Union, State Sovereignty). The legislature did authorize the redesign, but specifically required the redesign to maintain the motto's word order. Then they gave Tyndale responsibility for the redesign. Tyndale overhauled the Great Seal, but he did so in a manner that appeared to thwart the legislature's intent. His new seal featured a twisted banner, which caused the word \\"sovereignty\\" to be upside down, albeit, in the order required by the legislature. Tyndale's banner has remained in place, with only minor changes, since 1868.Seal of the State of Illinois ==Murder== Two years after leaving office, Tyndale was murdered outside his home, in Springfield, Illinois, on April 29, 1871.

His interest in video and computers started when he was a young boy. When he was 8 years old, he created short films on a Super 8 camera and programmed text adventure games on a Commodore 64 personal computer. He received a media arts education at Kalaheo High School in Kailua, Hawaii. Returning to the continental US, he worked in Los Angeles and New York City before moving to San Francisco in 1993. Not a fan of organized education, Zada declined scholarships to film school, preferring to go out and learn things on his own. In 1997, he and co- founder Greg Hipwell launched the website skyplane.com, which was acquired by Zefer in 1999. Zada currently lives in Mill Valley, California, with his wife and children. == Career == In 2000, Zada and partner Daniel Stein co-founded the San Francisco-based digital advertising agency Evolution Bureau (EVB). The company's growth as a full-service agency allowed him, as the firm's Executive Creative Director, to direct advertising campaigns for clients for television and the internet. In 2006, Omnicom Group bought a 50% interest in the firm. By 2008, EVB had grown to a 65-person company and Zada allowed Omnicom to acquire a majority stake in the company, and at the end of 2008, Zada left the company to pursue a career as a video and film director. Zada signed with film production company Tool of Northern America (TNA) in January 2009 and commutes between his Mill Valley home and Los Angeles. == Projects == In 2006, Zada and Evolution Bureau, in collaboration with advertising company \\"Toy.\\" of New York, developed the Elf Yourself interactive holiday viral marketing campaign for OfficeMax. The Elf Yourself interactive website allows visitors to upload pictures of themselves, or their friends, which they can then see on the dancing elfs. Originally with only one elf, the campaign was first used during the holiday season, beginning in November 2006, and returned each holiday season afterwards. When first released, it was a surprise hit and exceeded production's expectations with more than 194 million views in six weeks, and received the interactive involvement of more than 123 million people who uploaded photos of themselves to be seen on the Christmas elves. Beginning in 2007, the site used four elves and viewers could upload different images for each one. In 2011, Zada wrote and directed Take This Lollipop as both an interactive horror short film and a Facebook application, using the Facebook Connect app to allow viewers to bring themselves into the film using pictures and messages from their own Facebook profile. Originally intended as a social experiment, Zada admits he \\"threw the script together\\" in approximately 30 minutes, and completed the project in four weeks along with developer Jason Nickel and the collaborative efforts of Tool of North America. In November, 2011, \\"Take This Lollipop\\" was noted as the fastest-growing Facebook application. Zada TNA worked with Australia's Tourism Victoria and directed the crowdfunded \\"Remote Control Tourist\\" which, over a five-day period in October 2013, allowed potential Melbourne visitors to virtually explore the city using social media. Zada stated \\"Hundreds of photos, videos, and data will come to life and give anyone who is thinking of visiting or is currently visiting Melbourne the coolest and most interesting way to research and explore the city.\\" Zada helmed the 2016 film The Forest. Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer and Taylor Kinney starred,The Forest Attracts Game of Thrones Star Michiel Huisman from February 2015 and Focus Features has the North American distribution rights to the film, which was Zada's feature film directorial debut. == Recognition == In speaking toward Elf Yourself in his book Adland: Searching for the Meaning of Life on a Branded Planet, author James P. Othmer called it \\"a strange, corny, yet enormously successful website.\\" He observed that while 19 other sites created for OfficeMax had modest success, it was \\"nothing like the level of action that came out of the Elf Yourself site,\\" and that, as created by Zada, the site \\"not only transcended the online genre; it transcended advertising and became the kind of cultural event that marketers dream of\\". Zada's Take This Lollipop project has been the recipient of positive media attention, receiving national publicity, such as in Adland, Brandchannel, CNN, IndieWire, Forbes, Digital Trends, Adweek, The Star-Ledger, GlobalPost, The New York Times, Advertising Age, and has garnered international attention with coverage by newspapers and magazines including The Sydney Morning Herald. 20minutes, Sky Italia, Les Numeriques, TendanceOuest, Stern Magazine, Site Oueb. and International Business Times,. The project has sparked discussions over how to protect children when they are using the internet, with coverage from The New Zealand Herald, CNN, and Persoenlich. In a commentary on how parents must educate their children about the dangers inherent in a releasing of personal information about themselves to the internet, CNN reported that the film took the worst fears about posting personal information on the internet, and turned them into \\"two minutes of horror.\\" and later reported that \\"Behind the litany of frightening facts and figures (not to mention fears like those preyed upon in viral-video Take This Lollipop, an interactive horror film that incorporates text and images from your Facebook profile) lurks a disturbing truth.\\" Zada has won over 70 industry awards and has been recognized by Adweek, Creativity Magazine, Shoot Magazine, Communication Arts, The New York Times, Contagious Magazine as well as many other magazines, newspapers and books. === Partial awards and nominations === * 2004, Cannes Cyber Lion award for Wrigley's Winterfresh for Winterfresh Network * 2005, Internet Advertising Awards Competition, 'Best in Show' for Redwood Creek * 2006, ADDY Award for Adidas Basketball for Step Inside KG * 2006, Cannes Cyber Lion award for Burger King's The Whopperettes * 2006, London International Awards, 'Best Interactive Media', Orbit White, for Good Clean Feeling * 2006, SXSW award for LeapFrog Fly Pentop Computer * 2007, Ad:Tech Awards, 'Best Integrated Campaign', Adidas Soccer MLS Mashups * 2008, Ad:Tech Awards, 'Best of Show', OfficeMax, Elf Yourself * 2008, SXSW award for OfficeMax Elf Yourself * 2012, Advertising Age's '2012 Creativity 50' :; Take This Lollipop: * March 2012, won Overall 'Best in Show', and First Place 'Experimental' at SXSW * April 2012, won D&AD; Award for 'Digital Advertising/Web Films' * April 2012, nominated for Andy Award for 'Agency Innovation' * April 2012, won Webby Award for 'Online Guerilla & Innovation' * April 2012, nominated for three Webby Awards under categories 'Viral', 'Experimental and Weird', and 'Viral Marketing', * May 2012, won Bronze Clio Award for 'Self Promotion, Interactive' * May 2012, won two One Show Interactive Awards 'Gold Pencils': for 'Best Use of Scocial Media' and 'Gold Pencil' for 'Interactive Advertising Self-Promotion'. * May 2012, won Art Directors Club 'Silver Cube' award for 'Online Content'. * May 2012, nominated for Daytime Emmy Award for 'New Approaches - Daytime Entertainment'. * May 2012, nominated for four AICP Awards: 'Integrated Campaign', 'Website/Microsite', 'Cause Marketing', and 'Social' :; Remote Control Tourist: * 2013, won Favourite Website Awards 'site of the day' * 2013, won Bronze Award for 'Technical Achievement' at SXSW * 2014, won Gold Prix awards for 'Direct Content' and for 'Branded Content & Entertainment' at Singapore's Spikes Asia Festival * 2014, won 'Best in Show' and two Gold Awards ('Interactive Film' and for 'Creative Innovation'), two Silver Awards ('Branded Content' and 'Digital Campaign'), and seven Bronze Awards in several 'film and video and digital' categories from the 'Australasian Writers and Art Directors Association' * 2014, won Webby Award for 'Best Social Media Campaign' * 2014, won five 'Bronze Cyber Lions' awards at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. * 2014, won 'The Innovation Award', and award for 'Most Effective Use of Content', as well as commendations 'Art Direction', 'Branded Content', 'Data Visualisation', and for 'Digital Website & Microsites' ADMA awards from Australian Creativity & Effectiveness Awards for Marketing, Media, & Advertising * 2014, won Gold 'Best Content Creation Award' at C Squared Festival of Media * 2014, won first place 'Innovation Award' from F.I.T.C. * 2014, won 'Advertising Annual Award for Digital Advertising' from Communication Arts * 2012, won 'Next Award', category 'Experimental' from Association of Independent Commercial Producers == References  External links == * Category:American music video directors Category:American male screenwriters Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:People from Mill Valley, California Category:Film directors from Los Angeles Category:Screenwriters from California ","title":"Jason Zada"},{"id":"35968222","text":"Valery Vasilievich Radaev (), is a Russian politician, who served as the speaker and chairman of the Duma of Saratov Oblast from December 2007 until April 2012.

Alonso de Cárdenas was a Spanish noble who served as the 44th and 47th (and last) Grand Master of the Order of Santiago before the title passed to the Catholic Monarchs as the need for a powerful military order outside the direct control of the king ceased to exist with the end of the Reconquista. He is famous for building the castle at Puebla del Maestre in 1483. He was also the father of García López de Cárdenas. == Family == Alonso was a member of the House of Cárdenas, a relatively new family that would become increasingly powerful in Spain's colonial possessions in the New World. He was the father of García López de Cárdenas who would go on to discover the Gran Cañón del Colorado, what is today known simply as the \\"Grand Canyon\\". == Biography == Alonso de Cárdenas served the Catholic Monarchs during the War of the Castilian Succession. One of the captains under his command was Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, also known simply as the \\"Gran Capitan\\" for his considerable military exploits throughout Spain's European empire. After the Battle of Albuera, Alonso singled the Gran Capitan out for praise stating that he had always seen the captain leading his troops from the front, a fact he was sure of due to the splendor of his armor. Throughout his life, he had to engage in continuous power struggles to obtain and maintain power. With the finalization of the Spanish Reconquista, there were fewer and fewer possibilities to contribute militarily to the crown. For this reason, the struggles for power in contemporary Spain left the battlefield and were concentrated more on the political front. He was Grand Master of the Order of Santiago during two separate terms: the first was from 1474 to 1476 and the second lasted from 1477 to 1493, the last year that the order existed in a semi independent form from the Spanish crown. Alonso de Cárdenas obtained his first term as Grand Master after his predecessor, Juan Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena, renounced his title in favor of his son, Diego López de Pacheco y Portocarrero. This type of succession for the Grand Mastership of Santiago was incorrect as the title was traditionally one obtained by election and not by inheritance. This kicked off a power struggle amongst the nobles of the order and led to a confrontation between Rodrigo Manrique de Lara, and Don Alonso de Cárdenas himself. The result of this power struggle was a period of time in which the order had two different Grand Masters, one for Castile and one for Leon. King Ferdinand II of Aragon stepped into the argument and mediated this division which ended upon the death of Pedro Manrique two years later in 1476. For his contribution in the war against Portugal, Alonso was eventually granted the title of Grand Master in 1474. Throughout his tenure as the Grand Master, Alonso held his chapter meetings at Azuaga in the Chapel of San Sebastián which would later become known as the Convento de la Merced. Another instance of political conflict arose between members of the order and the Condado de Feria, located in Zafra. This dispute resulted in a confrontation between Alonso and the \\"Señor de Feria\\" after which an agreement was made that the order would demolish their castle at Los Santos de Maimona which had consequently been rebuilt only a few years previously in 1469 by the previous Grand Master, Juan Pacheco. Disputes also arose with Enrique de Guzmán, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, who in pursuit of the title of Grand Mastership, actively made war against Alonso and other members of the order. In 1475, Alonso de Cárdenas was forced to take refuge in the Castillo de Jerez de los Caballeros to defend himself against the Duke. Shortly thereafter in 1478, Alonso ambushed and defeated the Duke's forces at Guadalcanal after which time the Duke renounced his claim by order of the king. He finished his career as Grand Master in the Conquest of Granada. == Death and legacy == Alonso de Cárdenas died in 1493 and was buried in a sepulcher at the church of Santiago de Llerena in Llerena. After his death, the Order of Santiago, by papal mandate, passed into the ownership of the Spanish crown. With the finalization of the Reconquista, there was not any new Spanish territory to conquer on the Iberian Peninsula and nothing left to fight for. == See also == * Order of Santiago * List of Grand Masters of the Order of Santiago == References == * The information on this page was translated from its Spanish equivalent:es:Alonso de Cárdenas. * * Category:Year of birth missing Category:1493 deaths Category:15th-century Castilians Category:Spanish untitled nobility Category:Order of Santiago Category:Grand Masters of the Order of Santiago Category:Knights of Santiago ","title":"Alonso de Cárdenas"},{"id":"35968372","text":"Otis Moss Jr. (born February 26, 1935) is an American pastor, theologian, speaker, author, and activist.

The peak is at the edge of the Barrington Tops plateau, within the declared wilderness of the World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Wilderness streams, such as the Allyn River and Williams River rise nearby. On a clear day, the higher peaks of the Blue Mountains may be seen. And looking south east, the sands of Stockton Beach on the coast may be viewed. The scenic appeal of the area is well regarded.

It has since disappeared in natural bush re-growth. == Name == Carey’s Peak is named after a local drover. In 1839, 500 cattle were herded to Barrington Tops during a drought, but it snowed for 21 days that winter. All of the cattle died and the drover’s tents were blown away, so Carey suggested using the cattle hides to build a shelter. == Geology == The geology of the area includes Alkali Gabbro, a type of igneous rock.

Months prior to her husband taking office, Moreno said in an interview that she would prefer not like to use the style of First Lady, referring to it as \\"petulant and pink\\", pointing out that the title has been overused in that \\"there are many: that of the nation, of the department, of the municipality...\\", and stating that she would have liked to be addressed solely as \\"Lina María Moreno, wife of Álvaro Uribe\\", but establishing that that did not meant she was the sounding board of Uribe. On 11 April 2002, following the election of her husband in the 2002 presidential election, Clara Lía Mora and Clara Elena Moreno Mora, Moreno's aunt and first-cousin respectively, were kidnapped from their home in the Caldas, Antioquia at gunpoint. They were later rescued in a joint effort between the National Police and the 4th Brigade of the National Army, but during the operation the assailants shot Mrs Mora on the chest seriously injuring her; both mother and daughter were treated and successfully recovered, but it put pressure on authorities to take higher security precautions in the following months before and after the inauguration. In 2005, in an interview for El Tiempo, she told Yamid Amat that she was for the decriminalization of abortion, but still opposed to its legalization, a move that although not radical, contradicted the official position of the State and of the President. == References == Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Medellín Category:Colombian Roman Catholics Category:Pontifical Bolivarian University alumni Category:First Ladies of Colombia ","title":"Lina María Moreno Mejía"},{"id":"35968438","text":"Swamps of Huanchaco is an ecological Chimu reserve, about 14 km northwest of the historic center of Trujillo city, Peru.

Kenyan government officials asserted that many of the murders and blasts were carried out by Al-Shabaab in retaliation for Operation Linda Nchi, a coordinated military mission between the Somalian military and Kenyan military that began in October 2011, when troops from Kenya crossed the border into the conflict zones of southern Somalia. According to Kenyan security experts, the bulk of the attacks were increasingly carried out by radicalized Kenyan youth who were hired for the purpose. Kenya security officials also indicated that they were part of death squads, which carried out many of the killings under the orders of a government security council. By mid-2014, the cumulative attacks began affecting Kenya's tourism industry, as Western nations issued travel warnings to their citizens. ==Background== Since the Operation Linda Nchi began, Al-Shabaab vowed retaliation against the Kenyan authorities. At the militant group's urging,Al-Shabaab to retaliate in Kenya with \\"huge blasts\\" a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya have since been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to Islam.Kenya: A new breed of terrorist is born Estimates in 2014 placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 25% of Al-Shabaab's total forces. Referred to as the \\"Kenyan Mujahideen\\" by Al-Shabaab's core members, the converts are typically young and overzealous, poverty making them easier targets for the outfit's recruitment activities. Because the Kenyan insurgents have a different profile from the Somali and Arab militants that allows them to blend in with the general population of Kenya, they are also often harder to track. Reports suggest that Al-Shabaab is attempting to build an even more multi- ethnic generation of fighters in the larger region. One such recent convert who helped carry out the Kampala bombings but now cooperates with the Kenyan police believes that in doing so, the group is essentially trying to use local Kenyans to do its \\"dirty work\\" for it while its core members escape unscathed. According to diplomats, Muslim areas in coastal Kenya and Tanzania, such as Mombasa and Zanzibar, are also especially vulnerable for recruitment. In December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al- Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the extrajudicial killings. The murders reportedly totaled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed \\"Makaburi\\", an Al- Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the International Bar Association, Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported death squads, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges. By May 2014, the United States, United Kingdom, France and Australia began issuing travel warnings to their citizens in Kenya. This had an immediate impact on Kenya's tourism industry, as European visitors left the country and hotel establishments were consequently forced to lay off staff. The U.S. also reduced its staff levels at its Nairobi embassy. In June 2014, the U.K. likewise shut down its Honorary Consulate in Mombasa over security concerns. ==Timeline2011=== The first attack by al-Shabaab was on a blue-collar bar known as Mwaura's in downtown Mfangano Street in Nairobi on Monday, 24 October 2011, at around 1:15 am. The hurled grenade left one person dead and wounded more than 20. Police said that the weapon used was a Russian-made F1 grenade. A second blast occurred later the same day, when a grenade was tossed out of a moving vehicle into the Machakos bus terminus. 59 men and ten women were subsequently hospitalised, of which two were in intensive care and five people were confirmed dead. The attacks came only two days after the United States warned of \\"imminent\\" terror attacks. The US warning had implied that al-Shabaab would carry out reprisals in response to Kenyan troops' incursion into Somalia in mid-October. Elgiva Bwire Oliacha, a recent Kenyan Muslim convert, was arrested in connection with the two blasts and was sentenced to life in prison after having pleaded guilty to all charges. Al-Shabaab was suspected of carrying out a few more attacks in October as well. In November 2011, Al-Shabaab attacked several other locations including the East African Pentecostal Church, a military convoy, and a Holiday Inn hotel. The militant group is suspected of carrying out nine attacks in Kenya in December 2011; some of the attacks resulted in injuries and casualties while some resulted in no injuries.Bosire Boniface; 30 August 2012. Timeline: grenade and landmine attacks in Kenya ===2012=== January – June Militants were responsible for several attacks over the first few months of 2012. In January, there were three reported attacks, including the killing of the chairperson of the Community Peace and Security Team in Hagadera camp as well as several police officers. It was also reported that Kenyan police seized explosive equipment in an Ifo camp in the Dadaab complex, arresting nine suspects. In February, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for an attack that resulted in the death of a police officer and a civilian while injuring two other civilians. On 10 March 2012, six were killed and over sixty were injured after four grenades were thrown into a Machakos bus station in Nairobi. On Sunday, 29 April 2012, around 8:50am, an attack took place at God's House of Miracles Church at Ngara Estate in Nairobi. As reported by one of the dailies, an attacker, who goes by the name Amar, entered the church and left. He later came back and took a seat in the back, hurling the grenade at worshipers while they had been called by the pastor to the pulpit. The experts said that the grenade used had been made in China. One person died and 11 people were admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. On Tuesday, 15 May, three hand grenades were hurled at the Bella Vista nightclub in Mombasa, Kenya, killing one and leaving five others injured. The attacker also fired indiscriminately after he was denied entry into the Bella Vista club. A woman died as a result of a gunshot to the chest the two guards were injured. A suspect who had sustained injuries in the attack was arrested in connection to the assault. A bus ticket to Nairobi was recovered from the suspect and a magazine loaded with eight rounds of ammunition. Police arrested a suspect Mr. Thabit Jamaldin Yahya. He is still in remand.Willis Oketch. Standard Media. Grenade attack suspect charged with murder. On Monday, 28 May, a blast went off from inside the Sasa Boutique located within Assanand's House on Nairobi's Moi Avenue. 27 people were injured in the blast, and it was reported that four were in critical condition. Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said that the explosion was the result of either a grenade or a bomb. Over the course of four other May attacks, one police officer was killed and numerous others were injured. On Sunday, 24 June at around 10 pm EAT, another grenade attack was reported at a Jericho Beer Garden in Mishomoroni, Kisauni Constituency in Mombasa, Kenya. The bar was packed with patrons who had gathered to watch the UEFA European Championships 2012 football match between England and Italy. The grenade killed one person on the spot while two more died due to injuries while they were receiving treatment at the Coast general hospital. 30 more were injured, including a suspect who was alleged to be part of the attackers, a 9-year-old boy. This attack happened on the same day the Kenyan Navy had taken away two explosive devices that had been found floating in the Indian Ocean. The US government (through its embassy in Kenya) had issued a warning to its citizens to leave the coastal city of Mombasa due to a possible imminent attack. Athman Salim, a 23-year-old Kenyan day labourer from the Kilifi District was the main suspect of the attack. Although a Muslim, Athman denied any involvement with extremist groups or having ever journeyed to Somalia. He claimed that he had visited the pub to listen some local music, and indicated that he had never worked outside the city of Mombasa. He was released on 9 July after spending 10 days in Nyali police station.Philip Muyunga. Daily Nation. Court releases Mishomoroni terror suspect July – December On 1 July at around 10:15 am EAT, masked gunmen attacked two churches (the Central Catholic Cathedral and AIC churches) simultaneously in Garissa, located approximately 140 kilometres from the Somali border. The assailants killed seventeen people and left fifty injured. The churches are 3 kilometres apart and the dead included two police officers, four men, nine women and two children. The North Eastern Police Provincial Officer (PPO) Philip Ndolo reported that the gunmen attacked the two policemen first and took their firearms before they proceeded to attack the churches. The attackers used pistols to shoot the policemen at point blank range and then snatched their G3 rifles which were later used to shoot at the AIC church worshipers indiscriminately. No shooting was reported at the Catholic's Central Cathedral but a hand grenade was set off, resulting in less casualties than the AIC attack. The Supreme Muslim Council (SUPKEM) in Kenya warned of a misinterpretation of this attack as a religious war against the Christians. A joint effort by the Kenya Police, Administration Police, National Security Intelligence Service and the paramilitary General Service Unit saw the arrest of 83 suspects in connection with the attack during a massive security swoop after the attack. Four people were reported injured on 18 July when two hand grenades went off at a barbershop in Wajir. In addition, three police officers were injured on 25 July when their patrol hit a landmine. Police also arrested a man who was carrying two grenades at the Nakuru Agricultural Show shortly before President Mwai Kibaki arrived to deliver a speech. It was also reported that they arrested two men with four hand grenades in Kitale as they were boarding a Nairobi-bound bus; a third man escaped capture. On the evening of 3 August, one person was killed and six more were left injured at the Eastleigh neighbourhood near the Kenya Airforce headquarters in Nairobi. The attack came on the eve of a visit by Hillary Clinton, the United States secretary of state. The suicide bombing was inadvertently carried out by an innocent carrier of the detonated home-made device. The attackers have adopted a new way of executing their plans by giving unsuspecting citizens armed home-made explosives that they in turn detonate remotely at a safe distance. The attackers have been using ordinary home equipment like the transistor radios and gas cylinders in their new methods. This attack on 3 August blew the upper torso of the carrier of the transistor radio which contained the explosive. On 28 August, three Kenyan policeman are killed and over a dozen wounded in a grenade attack during riots in the port city of Mombasa over the killing of Islamist cleric Aboud Rogo Mohammed. On 30 September, at around 10:30am, a 9-year-old boy was killed when a grenade was hurled towards Sunday school children at St Polycarp Anglican Church along Juja road in Nairobi. On 21 September, four police officers and three civilians were injured during a series of two explosions. The first explosion targeted a GSU lorry and the secondary explosion went off when officers rushed to the scene.Cyrus Ombati. Standard Media. Four GSU officers injured in Garissa explosion . Retrieved 26 September 2012 There were several attacks on Administration Police officers in September. On 30 September, two police officers were shot dead from behind while patrolling along Ngamia road in Garissa. Additionally, on 15 September, two Administration Police officers were injured in an explosion when their vehicle hit a landmine.\\"Two officers injured in Mandera explosion\\". Standard Media. Retrieved 26 Sept. On 27 October, CID officer Yussuf Yero was shot and killed in a Hagdera, Daadab mosque as he read the Koran. On 20 November, Kenya Defence Forces were involved in an operation in Garissa, where KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters, killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents received treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by Farah Maalim, accused Kenyan officers of fomenting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), if the perpetrators are not brought to justice. Maalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval, and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2billion in missed revenue. Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation. CJPC Bishops also urged Kenyans to resist engaging in violence, and instead to report offences to the relevant authorities. Additionally, several police officers were killed and injured as attacks escalated. It was reported that on 11 November at least 38 police officers are killed by cattle rustlers in the northern part of the country. On 1 November, a policeman was on shot dead and another seriously injured on by assailants in Garissa town.

On Sunday, 18 November, ten people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosive went off on a mass transit mini-bus (matatu) in Eastleigh. The explosion is believed to be an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort. Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensues. Somalis defend their property, and interpret the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community. Relative calm reportedly returns by mid-afternoon. On Wednesday, 5 December, around 7pm, an explosion went off in the Joska area of Eastleigh, Nairobi, killing one person and wounding six others. The explosion that occurred during rush hour traffic was caused by a roadside bomb, and was not far from the site of a blast a few weeks earlier.

The blast occurred as a group of worshipers was leaving a nearby mosque after their prayers. On 16 January, suspected Islamic militants shot dead five people and injured three others at a restaurant in the eastern city of Garissa. Authorities said they believed the gunmen belonged to the Al- Shabaab group, as the victims included a senior prison warden, fitting a pattern of attacks against security forces. Two men believed to be suicide bombers of Somali origin died on the morning of 17 January 2013 after improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had gone off in Hagdera refugee camp in Dadaab.

In Japan, he failed the first stage, making it to 'the rope ladder' (the final obstacle) before timing out. That year, Campbell made it farther than all other American competitors and Japanese All-Stars. Campbell tried out in the first American Ninja Warrior, clearing the first two stages with one of the top times. During boot camp, he committed a rules infraction on one of the beach obstacles, and while it was noted that several other competitors got away with the same infraction, he was forced to redo the obstacle and lost a qualifying spot for Sasuke as a result. His nephew, Travis Furlanic, did qualify, ultimately failing at 'the jumping spider' in Japan. In order to practice for future competitions, Campbell built a replica of the entire first stage as well as several second and third stage obstacles in his backyard. Campbell's course was featured on G4's Attack of the Show, Men's Health, and on TruTV. In American Ninja Warrior 2, Campbell made it out of Boot Camp with a qualifying spot. In Sasuke 26, cleared the First Stage with the fastest time (21.51 seconds). He then went on to clear Stage 2 with 23.4 seconds. In Stage 3, he slipped while transferring to the fourth ledge of 'the ultimate cliffhanger'. Again, he performed better than all other Americans in the competition. In American Ninja Warrior 3, Campbell qualified for Sasuke 27. In the First Stage, he had the fastest time, finishing with over 44 seconds left on the clock (setting a SASUKE speed record). Campbell made it to the third stage, where he slipped on the sixth and final ledge of 'the ultimate cliffhanger'. Although it is often stated on the program that this is the farthest any American had ever gone on the Sasuke course, it is not accurate. Actor/martial artist Kane Kosugi reached the final stage in Sasuke 8. In 2012, Campbell competed in the fourth American Ninja Warrior tournament. He qualified with the fastest run during the Northwest qualifiers, with a time of 58.55 seconds. Both he and Furlanic earned spots in the ANW finals in Las Vegas, Nevada; however Furlanic did not compete at the Finals. Campbell failed on the \\"Spinning Bridge\\" in Stage 1 of the Finals. In 2013, Campbell competed in the fifth \\"American Ninja Warrior\\" in the Venice Qualifiers, and got 3rd place. In the Regional Qualifiers, he was one of four competitors to complete the whole course. In 2014, he competed in the sixth season and got the fastest times in the Venice Qualifiers and in the Venice Finals, and also he was one of four people that completed Cannonball Alley one of the most toughest city finals obstacles in history of American Ninja Warrior. In the Vegas Finals he failed stage 1 for the third time in a row where he failed the silk slider. In 2015, he led a Team USA All-Star team into an all-star game versus Team China on X Warrior (; lit. Ultimate Warrior), a Chinese gameshow like American Ninja Warrior. In 2016, Campbell completed all four stages of Mount Midoriyama in Sasuke Việt Nam, unofficially becoming the third American to achieve what is known as \\"Total Victory\\" after Geoff Britten and Isaac Caldiero completed the course on the seventh season of American Ninja Warrior. However, he had less success in America, finishing 17th in the Oklahoma City Finals and failing to make it to the National Finals in Las Vegas for the first time in his Ninja Warrior career. In 2017, Campbell competed in Los Angeles and barely qualified for the City Finals, finishing in 27th out of 30 qualifying competitors. Later, in the City Finals, Campbell advanced to the Vegas Finals, barely making the cut in 15th out of 15, after Grant McCartney failed to qualify. At the National Finals, Campbell completed Stage 1 for the first time in five seasons. He later fell on the fifth obstacle on Stage 2, \\"Wingnut Alley.\\" In 2018 on American Ninja Warrior 10, he returned in Los Angeles and where he completed both the Qualifying and Finals Coarse. In Vegas he once again failed Stage 1 on the Double Dipper. In 2019 on American Ninja Warrior 11, he returned stronger than ever in Los Angeles, placing 2nd in Qualifying where he competed on the Power Tower for the most chased after prize for qualifying: The Speed Pass.

The term was originally introduced by G.R. Veldkamp in a paper published in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1985 to denote a point P in the plane of a triangle ABC having the property that the triangles PBC, PCA and PAB have isoperimeters, that is, having the property that :PB + BC + CP = PC + CA + AP = PA + AB + BP. Isoperimetric points in the sense of Veldkamp exist only for triangles satisfying certain conditions. The isoperimetric point of triangle ABC in the sense of Veldkamp, if it exists, has the following trilinear coordinates. : ( sec ( A/2 ) cos ( B/2 ) cos ( C/2 ) − 1 , sec ( B/2 ) cos ( C/2 ) cos ( A/2 ) − 1 , sec ( C/2 ) cos ( A/2 ) cos ( B/2 ) − 1 ) Given any triangle ABC one can associate with it a point P having trilinear coordinates as given above. This point is a triangle center and in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC) it is called the isoperimetric point of the triangle ABC. It is designated as the triangle center X(175). The point X(175) need not be an isoperimetric point of triangle ABC in the sense of Veldkamp. However, if isoperimetric point of triangle ABC in the sense of Veldkamp exists, then it would be identical to the point X(175). The point P with the property that the triangles PBC, PCA and PAB have equal perimeters has been studied as early as 1890 in an article by Emile Lemoine.The article by Emile Lemoine can be accessed in Gallica. The paper begins at page 111 and the point is discussed in page 126.Gallica ==Existence of isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp== A triangle ABC in which the triangle center X(175) is not the isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp. Let ABC be any triangle. Let the sidelengths of this triangle be a, b, and c. Let its circumradius be R and inradius be r. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp can be stated as follows. :The triangle ABC has an isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp if and only if a + b + c > 4R + r. For all acute angled triangles ABC we have a + b + c > 4R + r, and so all acute angled triangles have isoperimetric points in the sense of Veldkamp. ==Properties== Let P denote the triangle center X(175) of the triangle ABC. *P lies on the line joining the incenter and the Gergonne point of triangle ABC. *The incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are pairwise tangent to one another. There is one more such point, namely, the equal detour point X(176) of triangle ABC. *The radical center of the incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB is P. There is one more such point, namely, the equal detour point X(176) of triangle ABC. *If P is an isoperimetric point of triangle ABC in the sense of Veldkamp, then the perimeters of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are equal to 2 Δ / ( 4R + r - ( a + b + c) ) where Δ is the area, R is the circumradius, r the inradius, and a, b, c the sidelengths of triangle ABC. ==Soddy circles== Inner and outer Soddy circles in the case where the outer Soddy point is an isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp. Inner and outer Soddy circles in the case where the outer Soddy point is not an isoperimetric point in the sense of Veldkamp. Given a triangle ABC one can draw circles in the plane of triangle ABC with centers at A, B, and C such that they are tangent to each other externally. In general, one can draw two new circles such that each of them is tangential to the three circles with A, B, C as centers. (One of the circles may degenerate into a straight line.) These circles are the Soddy circles of the triangle ABC. The circle with the smaller radius is the inner Soddy circle and its center is called the inner Soddy point or inner Soddy center of triangle ABC. The circle with the larger radius is the outer Soddy circle and its center is called the outer Soddy point or outer Soddy center of triangle ABC. The triangle center X(175), the isoperimetric point in the sense of Kimberling, is the outer Soddy point of triangle ABC. ==References *isoperimetric and equal detour points - interactive illustration on Geogebratube Category:Triangle centers ","title":"Isoperimetric point"},{"id":"35968523","text":"Palau–Philippines relations refers to the bilateral relations between Palau and the Philippines. ==Background== In the recent era, formal diplomatic relations between Palau and the Philippines were established on July 15, 1997. The formalization of ties were done in Manila and was oversaw by Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon and Palau Minister of State Andres Uherbelau. == Diplomatic missions == Palau President Thomas Remengesau Jr. meets with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City on February 15, 2018. Palau currently has an embassy in Manila as of 2012 while the Philippines previously had an embassy in Koror which opened in 1998. The closure of the embassy in Palau along with 9 other diplomatic missions of the Philippines by the end of July 2012 was announced on January 25, 2012. Budgetary constraints was the cited reason. Palau President Johnson Toribiong requested President Benigno Aquino III to reconsider the government's plan to close the embassy in Palau. According to Toribiong the embassy is essential in the delimitation talks on the two countries' maritime border and that the embassy serves about 5,000 Filipino workers, which compose of 60 percent of Palau's foreign work force and 20 percent of the country's total population. The closure of the Philippine embassy in Melekeok was expected to affect Filipinos in neighboring countries such as Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The Philippine embassy in Koror closed on July 31, 2012. Since then it has maintained relations with Palau along with Micronesia and the Marshall Islands through the DFA's Office of Asian and Pacific Affairs. Consular affairs fall under the auspices of the Philippine Consulate General in Hagåtña, Guam, and an honorary consulate in Koror.https://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy10102/ ==Cultural relations== There are 5,000 Filipino workers in Palau. 60 percent of all foreign workers from Palau came from the Philippines and they compose of 20 percent of Palau's total population. Palau's Medical Referral Program which was in force for almost 20 years, sends 100–150 patients annually to the Philippines for medical treatment. Many Palau citizens go to the Philippines to study in colleges and universities for higher education. A pygmy population was reported in Palau but disappeared in about 1100 A.D. == Disputes  Maritime borders === The exact boundaries of Palau and the Philippines is remained to be defined by delimitation talks. A final agreement has not been made regarding the issue. The two countries share a maritime border with Palau situated southeast of the Philippines. ===Filipinos fishing in Palau's EEZ=== Filipinos fishing within Palau's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) remains an irritant to Palauan Sovereignty. Palau's waters, especially near its southern reefs is currently threatened by over-fishing from boats from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries. Diplomatic relations between Palau and the Philippines reached its lowest point when Palau President Kuniwo Nakamura threatened to sever ties with the Philippines due to repeated violations of Palau's EEZ by Filipino fishing vessels in January 1999. However, in the recent years, Palau prefers to work on a fishing agreement with the Philippines rather than to file diplomatic protest against its neighbor. No fishing agreements have been established until now ==See also== * Filipinos in Palau * Foreign relations of Palau * Foreign relations of the Philippines == References == Philippines Category:Bilateral relations of the Philippines ","title":"Palau–Philippines relations"},{"id":"35968559","text":"The Dalit (formerly \\"Untouchable) community of India, and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, are subject to many disadvantages in health care access. As of 2008, there are 166.6 million Dalits in India.Minority Rights Group International, World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - India : Dalits, 2008. Available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d13c.html. Accessed on May 28, 2012. Scheduled indigenous tribes and scheduled castes have been and continue to be the most socially disadvantaged groups in India that continue to be identified as needing affirmative action in terms of employment and education, for example, by the Indian government.National Family Health Survey 1998–99. Mumbai, India: International Institute of Population Sciences; 2000. ==Health care utilisation== Among individuals belonging to scheduled castes, health care utilisation tends to be lower and mortality rates tend to be higher than among members of higher castes. According to a study on health care-seeking behaviour and health care spending by young mothers in India, women from lower castes spent less on public sector practitioners than higher caste women. Additionally, lower caste women also spent less on private practitioners and self-medication than higher caste women and non-Hindu women, yet experienced more self-reported morbidities than women from higher castes.Bhatia, J. and Cleland, J. “Health-care seeking and expenditure by young Indian mothers in the public and private sectors.” Health Policy and Planning. 2001;16(1): 55-61. In a study on utilisation of antenatal care among women in southern India, women belonging to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes were 30% less likely than women from higher castes to have received antenatal care in the state of Andhra Pradesh even when potential confounding factors, such as age, birth order, and education level, were held constant. Also, while controlling for other factors, women belonging to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes in the state of Karnataka were about 40% less likely to have had antenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy than women from higher castes. The study also found that women belonging to scheduled casts or scheduled tribes were less likely to give birth at hospitals and to be assisted by a health professional during delivery than women from higher castes.Navaneetham, K. and Dharmalingam, A. “Utilization of maternal health care services in Southern India.” Social Science & Medicine. 2002;55: 1849-1869. In terms of mortality, it has also been found that lower caste members face higher mortality rates during the earliest and latest part of life, especially among children and adolescents (i.e., 6 to 18 years of age) and the elderly.Subramanian, S.V., Smith, G.D., and Subramanyam, M. “Indigenous health and socioeconomic status in India.” PLoS Medicine. 2006;3(10): 1794-1804. In terms of health expenditure, the burden of health care spending is greatest among those living in rural and economically poor areas, with members of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes being the most affected by health care spending.Balarajan, Y., Selvaraj, S., and Subramanian, S.V. “Health care and equity in India.” Lancet. 2011;377: 505-515. ==Current programs == One of the most recent government-sponsored initiatives to improve health care access among Dalits includes a state-government-funded health insurance scheme called the Rashtriya Swasthiya Bima Yojana (RSBY), which translates into English as “National Health Insurance Scheme.” It works by sharing the risk of a major health catastrophe by pooling the risks across many households. This health insurance scheme was first implemented on April 1, 2008 by the Ministry of Labour and Employment of the Government of India in order to provide health insurance coverage to families living below the poverty line (BPL). One of the main objectives of the programme is to protect BPL households from financial liabilities that often result from major health catastrophes that involve costly hospitalisation. Additionally, pre-existing conditions are covered from the first day of coverage, there is no age limit for coverage, and coverage can be extended to five members of the family. However, beneficiaries are required to pay 30 rupees as a registration fee when enrolling in the program. RSBY is not the first attempt by the Indian government to provide health insurance to low-income families. Compared to other past initiatives, though, RSBY allows beneficiaries to choose between public and private hospitals and makes hospitals compete for their clients/patients, follows a business model with built-in incentives for all stakeholders; allows for the portability of coverage from one district to the next through the use of a Smart Card; employs cashless and paperless transactions; among other factors.Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna. “Health Insurance for the Poor.” Available at: www.rsby.gov.in. Accessed on: May 28, 2012. Some of the key features of NRHM include: the scaling up of public spending to 2-3% of the gross domestic product by 2012 for vulnerable populations in key geographic areas; an increased flexibility of central and state funds, especially among health facilities that involve local governing bodies; a focus on primary health care, especially in rural areas, with increased opportunity for referrals and improvement in secondary and tertiary referral facilities; the formation of public-private partnerships to improve service delivery; more strategies for reaching distant and isolated populations, such as through the use of mobile health clinics, e-health, and/or telemedicine; the implementation of a conditional cash transfer scheme to encourage facility-based births as a means of reducing infant and maternal mortality rates; an increased role of the community through an investment in community-based health workers and activists; the integration of traditional and alternative methods of healing and wellness; the integration of inter- and multi-sectoral responses to addressing social determinants of health education, knowledge, and health- seeking behaviours; among other features.Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. “National Rural Health Mission.” Available at: www.mohfw.nic.in/NRHM.htm.

Founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt in 2012, the ODI’s mission is to connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data. The ODI’s global network includes individuals, businesses, startups, franchises, collaborators and governments who help to achieve the mission. == Learning == The Open Data Institute provides in-house and online, free and paid-for training courses. ODI courses and learning materials cover theory and practice surrounding data publishing and use, from introductory overviews to courses for specific subject areas. ODI 'Friday lunchtime lectures' cover a different theme each week surrounding the communication and application of data, and usually feature an external speaker. == ODI themes == In order to bring open data’s benefits to specific areas of society and industry, the ODI focuses much of its research, publications and projects around specific themes and sectors. === Data infrastructure === Since its inception in 2012, the ODI has championed open data as a public good, stressing the need for effective governance models to protect it. In 2015, the ODI was instrumental in beginning a global discussion around the need to define and strengthen data infrastructure. In ‘Who owns our data infrastructure’, a discussion paper launched at the International Open Data Conference in Ottawa, the ODI explored what data ownership looked like and what we could expect from those who manage data that is fundamental to a functioning society. The ODI is developing common definitions to describe how data is used via a ‘Data Lexicon’, and ‘Data Spectrum’ visualisation that shows how they fit together across the spectrum of closed, shared and open data. Definitions in the lexicon include: Data that is closed (only accessible by its subject, owner or holder); data that is shared (with named access – data that is shared only with named people or organisations, group-based access – data that is available to specific groups who meet certain criteria, and public access – data that is available to anyone under terms and conditions that are not ‘open’); and data that is open (data that anyone can access, use and share). According to the ODI, for data to be considered ‘open’, it must be accessible, which usually means published on the World Wide Web; be available in a machine-readable format and have a licence that permits anyone to access, use and share it – commercially and non-commercially. === Data as culture === The ODI’s Data as Culture art programme engages artists to explore the use of data as an art material, to question its deep and wide implications on culture, and to challenge our understanding of what data is and its impact on people and society, our economy and businesses, and the environment. ODI Associate Curator, Hannah Redler, selected ‘Data Anthropologies’ as Data as Culture’s 2015–16 theme, placing people at the centre of emerging data landscapes. For it the ODI commissioned Artists in Residence, Thomson & Craighead, Natasha Caruana and Alex McLean to exhibit work and create new data-driven pieces. === Global development === The ODI promotes data as a tool for global development, delivering support programmes in developing countries, conducting research, and helping to develop recommended practices and policies when applying open data to development challenges. The ODI has supported open data leaders in governments around the world to boost economies, innovation, social impact and transparency using open data. As part of the Open Data for Development Network, funded by the International Development Research Centre, the ODI created the Open Data Leaders Network – a space for peer-learning. In 2015 the ODI worked with the Burkina Faso Open Data Initiative, who used open data to ensure that citizens had access to real-time, open results data for their freest and fairest presidential elections in nearly three decades. == ODI sectors  Finance === The ODI focuses on highlighting how data can enhance FinTech and banking and bring broad benefits to customers, regulators and industry. As part of a joint industry and government Open Banking Working Group, the institute created a framework for designing and implementing the Open Banking Standard. This highlights how banking customers can have more control over their data, and how to create an environment that maximises data reuse. In ‘Data sharing and open data for banks’, a report for HM Treasury and Cabinet Office, the ODI explains why making data more accessible, and sharing transactional data via open APIs, could improve competition and consumer experience in UK banking. The paper focuses on key technologies and how they can support data sharing via APIs that preserve privacy. The ODI’s 2013 ‘Show me the money’ report focused on the UK peer-to-peer lending (P2P) market, revealing ‘lending by region’ using data from P2P platforms. === Agriculture and nutrition === Through research, open discussion and sector-focused events, the ODI is identifying challenges, solutions and global priorities in improving agriculture and nutrition with open data. ‘How can we improve agriculture, food and nutrition with open data?’, an ODI report written in partnership with the Global Open Data for Agriculture Initiative, presents 14 use cases showing open data use in agriculture, food production and consumption. === Open cities === A 2018 ODI report on open map data The ODI runs an Open Data for Smart Cities training course, and works closely with relevant ODI Members to highlight opportunities for urban planners, entrepreneurs and city residents. == Global network == The ODI issues awards for data access. === Members === ODI Members are organisations and individuals, from large corporations to students, who explore, demonstrate and share the value of data. The ODI grew its network of businesses, startups, academic establishments and individuals from to over 1,300 in 2015, and launched student membership in line with its goal to help provide lifelong data expertise for young people around the world. ODI Members (whether sponsors, partners or supporters) are all committed to unlocking the value of data, and are key to developing the ODI's professional network in the UK and internationally. New member companies in 2015 included Deutsche Bank, Ocado Technology, SAP and The Bulmer Foundation. === Startups === Each year the ODI invites new applicants onto its ODI Startup programme in order to support them to develop a sustainable business, from idea to product to growth. ODI Startups are provided with coaching and mentoring from external mentors, ad- hoc office space, discounted training courses, and access to other members of the ODI global network for networking and peer learning. The ODI assesses startups for the programme based on the strength of their idea and team, market opportunity and timing, potential scale, use of open data, and potential impact. 30 ODI Startups have joined the programme, which between them employ 185 people and have secured over £10m in contracts and investments. === Nodes === ODI Nodes are franchises of the ODI. Hosted by existing (for-profit or not-for-profit) organisations, ODI Nodes operate locally and are connected globally as part of the ODI Node network. Each node adopts the ODI Charter, an open codification of the guiding principles and rules under which the ODI operates. ODI HQ (based in London) charges ODI Nodes to be part of the network. ODI Node types include pioneer nodes, learning nodes, community nodes and story nodes. Pioneer nodes are ambassadors for the ODI’s global network. They work collaboratively with HQ to help ensure the node network is sustainable, lead the delivery of quality services to market and develop initiatives that can scale across the network. Learning nodes establish local training via ODI Registered Trainers, and focus on growing their reach by tailoring ODI Learning to local demand. Community nodes convene local individuals and organisations interested in open innovation, delivering local events and workshops. They raise awareness of data’s economic, social and environmental benefits, and encourage local collaboration. Story nodes raise awareness, share challenges and promote best practice in harnessing data’s economic, social and environmental benefits via blogs from their perspectives within their local contexts, across sectors and themes. === Advisory === The ODI provides consultancy, training and research and development advisory to help governments, organisations and businesses to use open data to create economic, environmental and social value. The ODI assesses how open data can impact organisations, implement open data strategies and innovate with open data to solve problems and create new opportunities. === Software === The ODI Labs team creates tools, techniques and standards for open data publishing. Flagship ODI Labs products include Open Data Certificates, which show that data has been published in a sustainable and reusable way, and an Open Data Maturity Model and associated Open Data Pathway tool for organisations to assess their data practices (developed in collaboration with The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). ODI Labs also focus on implementing the World Wide Web Consortium's CSV on the Web recommendations via CSVlint, its validator for CSV files. == Evidence and research  ODI Stories === The ODI is committed to demonstrating evidence for open data’s social, economic and environmental benefits with open data stories and long-form publications. These are generated from ODI research, the work of the ODI’s global network of startups, members and nodes, and the ODI Showcase programme, which supports projects to achieve open data impact. === ODI Research === The ODI undertakes research on a broad range of areas related to open data. This includes exploring the evidence for the impact of open data; research and development of tools and standards to assist producers, publishers and users of open data; examining the implications, challenges and opportunities of deploying open data at web scale; and applications of open data to address or illuminate real-world problems. Ongoing projects include: Mapping and understanding the scale of open data's potential value in business, with reports to date analysing open data companies that create products and services, and how three big businesses – Thomson Reuters, Arup Group and Syngenta create value with open innovation. Data-and-Platform-as-a-Service (DaPaaS), which simplifies the consumption of open (and linked) data, by delivering a platform for publishing, consuming and reusing open data, as well as deploying open data applications. OpenDataMonitor, which provides users with an online monitoring and analytics platform for open data in Europe. It will provide insights into open data availability and publishing platforms by developing and delivering an analysis and visualisation platform that harvests and analyses multilingual metadata from local, regional and national data catalogues. Share-PSI is the European network for the exchange of experience and ideas around implementing open data policies in the public sector. It brings together 45 partners covering 26 countries with representatives from government departments, standards bodies, academic institutions, commercial organisations, trade associations and interest groups. DaPaaS and OpenDataMonitor are co-funded by the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7). Share PSI is co-funded by the European Commission under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. == Board and senior leadership == The institute is led by: * Jeni Tennison, Chief Executive Officer * Louise Burke, Finance and Compliance director * Tim Berners-Lee, President and co-founder * Nigel Shadbolt, Chairman and co-founder * Roger Hampson, ODI Board member * Martha Lane-Fox, ODI Board member * Martin Tisné, ODI Board member * Neelie Kroes, ODI Board member * Richard Marsh, ODI Board member == Funding == The ODI is part core- grant and part income-backed. £10m of public funds were pledged by the UK Technology Strategy Board to the ODI in 2012 (£2m/year over five years). A further $4,850,000 of funding has been secured via Omidyar Network. ODI derives its income from training, membership, research and development, services and events.

He was the Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Oakleigh from 1932 to 1937, for the United Australia Party. ==Early life== He was born in 1897 in Parkside, a suburb of Adelaide, to Thomas Ladyman Home Smith and Minerva Mary Daniel. He was educated at Adelaide High School, and on 25 April 1915, joined the Bank of New South Wales in Adelaide as a bank clerk.Bank of New South Wales Roll of Honour , Bank of New South Wales. ==Military service== Vinton Smith enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at Adelaide on 1 February 1916, and was assigned to the 113th Howitzer Battery of the 13th Brigade, with which he saw active service in France. He attained the rank of Lieutenant on 1 March 1917. On 2 April 1919, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during a battle on the Selle River in October 1918, for which he was also Mentioned in Despatches. The citation read: ==Political career== Vinton Smith nominated as a candidate for the seat of Oakleigh in the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the 1932 Victorian state election. Although aligned with the United Australia Party, he was not the endorsed UAP candidate, and ran as an independent against the official UAP candidate and the Labor candidate, incumbent member Squire Reid. When the UAP candidate was eliminated, his second preferences gave him a majority over Reid, winning him the seat. Despite having defeated the endorsed candidate, Vinton Smith was immediately admitted to the UAP parliamentary party upon his election. Vinton Smith—this time fully endorsed by the UAP—narrowly defeated Reid again in the 1935 election, but Reid regained the seat in 1937. Vinton Smith contested the federal by-election for Corio in 1940, but lost to the Labor candidate John Dedman. ==Business career== After leaving politics, Vinton Smith returned to the financial sector. He founded a stock trading firm, which upon his death was left to two of his business partners, W.R. Dougall and F.J. Dean. The firm became known as Vinton Smith, Dean & Dougall, and later Vinton Smith Dougall, Ltd. He was also chairman of Edments Holdings Ltd., and company director for F. J. Walker Ltd., Sydney; M. B. John Ltd., valve manufacturers, Ballarat; Silk and Textile Printers Ltd., Hobart; Modern Permanent Building Society Ltd., Carpet Manufacturers Ltd., Sydney; and several other companies. ==Suicide== On 22 July 1952, Vinton Smith told his wife he was going to the shed at their Malvern East home to chop wood.

This submarine is powered by 26650 Li-Ion batteries and can be assembled from common materials, with the most expensive piece being the BeagleBone Black Linux computer (~$89). The submarine is controlled from a laptop computer connected to the submarine via a tether and is equipped with on-board LEDs and a camera. OpenROV is an open-source hardware project. By providing the list of the submarine parts and instructions on how to assemble them, the developers aim to democratize underwater exploration. == Community == In addition to being a robotic submarine, OpenROV is also a DIY community of amateur and professional OpenROV submarine builders in over 30 countries that pursue underwater exploration. OpenROV forums provides a platform for users to discuss ideas, solve problems, and share information. Similarly, users can document builds, projects, and deployments on the Open Explorer platform. == Hall City Cave == The development of the OpenROV submarine was in part fueled by the legend that stolen gold is hidden in the deep waters of the Hall City Cave located near Hayfork in Trinity County, Northern California. According to the legend, a few renegade Native Americans stole ~100 pounds of gold nuggets from miners in the 1800s, but were chased. To escape from the pursuit, the renegades had to bury the nuggets in deep waters of the nearby Hall City Cave to lighten their load, but could not retrieve the gold, because they were soon caught and hanged. Even though many have tried to find the gold, nobody has been able to get to the bottom of the narrow and deep well of the cave. Some of the OpenROV testing has taken place at that cave. However, there appears to be no newspaper reports of this particular ambush and murders, though there is a report of two miners being murdered and the gold being buried on one of the river flats of the upper Trinity River. ==Developers== The idea to build OpenROV was pioneered by Eric Stackpole, an engineering intern at NASA at the time, to discover whether the legend about the hidden treasure of the Hall City Cave was true. David Lang, a self-taught sailor from Minnesota, heard about Stackpole building a small, cheap, and robust submarine in his garage to search for the gold and became inspired to join. Matteo Borri designed and built the electronics, software and motor system for a prototype presented at the World Maker Faire in 2011. Lang and Stackpole co-founded OpenROV as an open-source hardware project, a startup, and a DIY community. == References  External links == * OpenROV website * Prototype overview * Eric Stackpole and David Lang explain OpenROV on Kickstarter (2012) * Eric Stackpole explains OpenROV on YouTube: NASA Space Apps Challenge (2012) * Eric Stackpole explains OpenROV on YouTube: Aquarius Reef Base (2012) * David Lang explains OpenROV at TED (2013) == Bibliography == * El Jalaoui, A.

The practice is not widely discussed by universities that use it, but is reported to be used by a number of top-ranked schools, Ivy League and otherwise. ==Definition== A development case is an application to an undergraduate institution that is set aside during the admission process for further review. In these cases, the merits of admitting a student based on their academic performance, test scores, and extracurricular activities are lowered by the donations of the applicant's family. With development cases, a student whose academic performance and test scores are not enough to merit admission might instead be dependent on the donations the applicant's family may give. ==Mechanics== Development cases theoretically have a better chance of acceptance. While there is no universal system for acceptance or rejection from a given university, most elite universities use numerical metrics to deal with the large number of applications, and the development case label can mean a numerical advantage or a tiebreaker in these metrics. This numerical advantage is comparable to that of a star athlete or legacy applicant. The number of development cases is low, which one source finds surprising. Estimates range from less than 1% to 5%. This low number is due to the decisions of the admissions director and the large amounts of money required to make a difference—in the millions of US dollars. ==Example== A possible development case is illustrated by Jared Kushner's Harvard College acceptance. This case is specifically named by Daniel Golden's book The Price of Admissions: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges—and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates. In the book, Golden highlights the 1998 donation of $2.5 million by Jared's father Charles Kushner. Golden argues that this donation influenced the decision-making process of the admissions committee and ensured Jared's acceptance for 1999. Golden quotes sources from Jared Kushner's high school who did not believe that Kushner could be accepted on merit alone. A spokesperson for Kushner Companies denied the allegation that the gift and the admission were related and pointed out that Charles and Seryl Kushner have donated over US$100 million to charitable causes. Jared Kushner was not a legacy admission, which is more widely acknowledged as a factor in admissions decisions. Charles Kushner graduated from New York University as an undergraduate and from Hofstra University and NYU with a J.D. and an M.B.A, respectively. ==Controversy== Development cases are controversial because they influence college acceptance decisions in non-transparent ways. The use of development cases has been compared to racial and legacy preferences because large donors tend to be from non-diverse backgrounds. Schools and admissions officers have defended their use of development cases because admitting a few weak students who will bring in excessive donor money benefits the other students at the school. Alumni contributions are a significant part of voluntary donation, with $7.1 billion contributed in 2004–05, accounting for 28% of all voluntary support. An extensive analysis of donor giving concluded that some donations were made with the hope of a higher admissions probability for a child. Daniel Golden, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist at the Wall Street Journal with a B.A. from Harvard, is probably the most vocal writer on the topic. He has published several articles and a book on the topic. His articles have drawn responses from universities such as Duke, which was specifically named in several of the articles, as well as Kushner Companies in response to Golden's addressing of Jared Kushner in the book. ==See also== * Legacy preferences ==References== Category:University and college admissions ","title":"Development case"},{"id":"35968680","text":"Laado ('Lovely daughter') is a 2000 Indian Haryanvi-language romance film directed by Ashwini Chaudhary, starring Ashutosh Rana and Arundhati.

Nohra, the eldest of four children has two brothers, Eduardo and David, and one sister Laura. At a young age the family moved to Bogotá, and she attended the New Granada School where she finished her primary education and then attended the Marymount School where she finished her secondary education, and afterwards travel to France where she studied journalism at the École Française des Attachés de Presse in Paris. After college, Puyana worked for the French magazine Elle, for Christian Dior, and for the UNESCO Press Corps. In 1978 back in Colombia, she met Andrés Pastrana Arango, a lawyer and then Director of Guión magazine, and the son of former President of Colombia Misael Pastrana Borrero and his wife and former First Lady María Cristina Arango Vega; they were introduced at a corrida de toros in Cartagena de Indias by Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, a mutual friend of the Puyanas and the Pastranas. They met again later that year at a new year's party and they started dating shortly after. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony on 20 March 1981 at the Church of Saint Peter Claver in Cartagena. Together they have three children: Santiago (born 18 December 1982), Laura (born 11 May 1985), and Valentina (born 25 April 1996).

The game is the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth installment in the Strike series, which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis. The Soviet Strike development team also created Nuclear Strike. EA released a PC port the same year; THQ developed and in 1999 published a Nintendo 64 version called Nuclear Strike 64. Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay. The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections. The game received positive, negative and mixed reviews. Critics noted a weak storyline, though GameSpot dismissed this is as unimportant in an action game. GameSpot called the graphics - which made use of specialised hardware such as 3Dfx Voodoo video cards and the N64 Expansion Pak - \\"about as good as it gets\\", while Allgame said they are \\"decent\\" and Daily Radar called them \\"horrible\\". Critics praised the full motion video as well as the music and sound effects. Reviewers enjoyed the straightforward gameplay but several complained of a close similarity to its predecessor Soviet Strike and questioned the game's value as a result. ==Plot== The game begins in Indocine, a fictional Southeast Asian country. The player controls a Super Apache helicopter as part of the STRIKE covert operations force, led by General Earle (John Marzilli) and assisted by technician Hack (Antwon Tanner) and propagandist Andrea Gray (Susan Turner-Cray). The antagonist is Colonel Beauford LeMonde (Bo Hopkins), a spy-turned-warlord who has stolen a nuclear weapon. Allied to STRIKE in Indocine is guerrilla leader Naja Hana (Moon Bloodgood), whose forces join the player in attacking LeMonde's forces. Meanwhile, LeMonde bluffs STRIKE by arming a fake nuclear bomb in an old temple compound, which results in Naja attempting to locate the warhead and LeMonde. At the same time, the player is sent on a wild goose chase attacking a decoy convoy thought to have the nuclear bomb being transported away from Indocine. In actuality, LeMonde escapes capture long before STRIKE could catch up to him and he managed to smuggle the real nuclear bomb away from Indocine off-screen. This prompts the player to extract Naja from the now booby-trapped compound before the whole compound blew up sky high. Nonetheless, his forces are eventually defeated in Indocine and STRIKE conducts their operations in the South China Sea, where LeMonde is discovered dealing with Napoleon Hwong (Philip Tan), head of a fictional Triad-like criminal organization known as the Octad. The player recruits mercenary Harding Cash (Jamie Donovan) in battling the pirate warlord in an attempt to recover the missing nuclear weapon. After defeating Hwong's forces, the player and Harding manage to capture and interrogate Hwong for information concerning the whereabouts of the nuke long enough before Hwong commits suicide. The player eventually heads to Pyongyang, North Korea, where the stolen nuke is located. LeMonde resurfaces in Pyongyang, where North Korean ruler Kym Zung-Lee invites several world leaders to a peace conference. The two plan to kidnap the world leaders, especially since Kim financed LeMonde's operations in Indocine and getting the nuclear weapon (stashed inside Kim Il-sung's statue on Mansudae Hill). Using a small helicopter and nonlethal weapons, the player is able to spirit the delegates to a French frigate somewhere in the Taedong River and get them out of the country; other delegates left behind are sent to bomb shelters or are evacuated by STRIKE Chinook transports. Also, between escorting the delegates to safety, the player and Andrea manage to take over an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter from a museum while fending off Kym's security forces in the process. The missing nuclear weapon explodes as the player sits out the blast in the Rungnado May Day Stadium. North Korea blames the nuclear explosion on the South and sends its forces across the DMZ in an attempt to start a second Korean War while LeMonde heads to Russia. STRIKE heads down to the DMZ and assists US Forces Korea and the South Korean Army in repelling the assault. Having prevented another Korean War, STRIKE, together with Naja and Cash, attack an old Mongol-era fortress in Siberia, where LeMonde has brought in mercenaries to fortify it as he prepares the launch of a \\"proto-nuclear\\" missile designed to rupture the ozone layer. LeMonde's forces are eventually routed, the proto-nuclear missile eventually destroyed, LeMonde himself is killed, and Naja and Cash fall in love. ==Gameplay== The player's helicopter destroys an enemy ship, with ensuing explosions Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based shooter game with a blend of both strategy and action, which the player views from outside the helicopter from an overhead perspective. It is similar to previous games in the series, but has 15 playable vehicles, a larger number than any of its predecessors. The main helicopter is a fictional Super Apache, with additional helicopters including the Cobra and other Hueys. Playable jets include the Harrier Jump Jet and a fictional V/STOL version of the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The player can use surface vehicles including the M1 Abrams tank, Bradley armoured vehicle, the Multiple Launch Rocket System and a PACV hovercraft. The game features five different terrain settings with each level being played on a large map divided into several missions. These missions include seek-and-destroy, search-and-rescue, escorts, the destruction of bridges, supply drops and air support. In some sections the player forms part of a coordinated attack with AI-controlled allies, while in others the player directs ground troops in the style of a real-time strategy game. As well as engaging in combat, the player must monitor and replenish his fuel and ammunition supplies. The heads-up display shows this information, along with intelligence on missions objectives and on friendly and enemy units and their locations. The compass indicating mission objectives is a feature new to Nuclear Strike, as is a radar showing the positions of nearby enemies. ==Development== The game is the second 32-bit Strike game: the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth installment in the Strike series, which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis. It was developed at Electronic Arts' Granite Bay Software, by a 50 strong team led by producer Michael Kosaka and including the same core group - designers, programmers, artists and composers - as developed Soviet Strike. Series creator Mike Posehn received royalties for Nuclear Strike but did not work on programming the game. The game retained Soviet Strike's engine, with several modifications. The development team increased the frame rate by 25% over its predecessor, resulting in a faster and smoother feel. The game streams the environment from its CD, resulting in no perceptible loading time, while the terrain itself is persistent: damage such as cratering remains for the duration of play. The team improved the artificial intelligence and added more camera angles, though the game like its predecessors still eschews any in-cockpit perspective. Soviet Strike received criticism regarding the player's limited view of his surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it. To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team did not wish to alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead made it more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and more visual and audio clues. Producer Kosaka explained: \\"A lot of the stuff we couldn't fit in [Soviet Strike] is going in this one\\". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among the new additions, as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more intense music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman. This latter shoot also employed a live tiger. Initially only the PlayStation version and a PC port were planned, but the game appeared on the Nintendo 64 in 1999 as Nuclear Strike 64. The PC port was developed by EA Tiburon, with both the PlayStation original and PC published by Electronic Arts in 1997. Nuclear Strike 64 was developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light and published by THQ. Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was later planned, but the game was eventually released as Future Cop: LAPD, a mech-based shooter game. ==Reception== Daily Radar found the story lacking, while GameSpot's Shane Mooney defended it thus: \\"people moan about a lack of a compelling story in action titles, which makes about as much sense as complaining about the lack of a nailgun in a football sim [...] People couldn't care less if the story was written by Steinbeck or Stymy the Hack, as long as they get to see THX- rattling fireballs and bad guys bleeding from every orifice.\\" IGN noted improved graphics, which it favourably compared to those of a John Woo film. GameSpot called the graphics as \\"about as good as it gets\\", particularly with a 3D video card. The New Straits Times also appreciated the game's performance with a 3Dfx Voodoo card, praising the graphics of the terrain, as well as water and helicopter movements. GameFan acclaimed the attention to detail and variety in environment graphics' textures. GamePro opined that \\"Smooth, polished landscapes and polygon-rich explosions snazz up the graphics, but the backgrounds aren't interactive and actually look fake (especially the frozen whitecap swells in the ocean).\\" Reviewing the PC version, Allgame called the graphics \\"decent\\", but criticised the minimal progress from Soviet Strike which resulted in \\"a slightly archaic look\\" and lack of \\"a feel of individuality\\". Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, the website noted that the graphics ably handled numerous explosions and enemies. The reviewer praised the detail, colours and fluid motion. He also acknowledged the use of the N64's Expansion Pak, but said \\"the game still moves and looks very nice\\" without it. Game Revolution felt: \\"This is definitely the best-looking 'Strike' game yet.\\" It praised the \\"gorgeously rendered\\" maps and the detail on structures and units, while Next Generation complained of \\"water that doesn't ripple and a few other missing touches\\" resulting in a somewhat haphazard feel. Daily Radar praised the terrain graphics but called the vehicles \\"horrible\\". Power Play praised the impressive graphics and destructible scenery. Game Revolution also praised the persistent battlefields: \\"What really stands out is the ability to interact with everything. When you shoot water, you see and hear the splashes. You can blow up almost anything that they've put on the map\\" but noted the sometimes unrealistic results, such as ships being launched high into the air upon destruction. Edge called said the terrain graphics were \\"some of the best yet on the PlayStation\\", but there were otherwise no ground-breaking visuals. GameFan praised the \\"super stylish\\" full motion video. Kraig Kujawa of Electronic Gaming Monthly described it as \\"snazzy, MTV-style\\", while his co- reviewer Shawn Smith said it was impressive enough for him to yearn for a Nuclear Strike feature-length film. Allgame felt the game to be worth playing for the FMV alone, calling it the \\"best aspect of the game\\" and \\"an awesome video presentation that, combined with a number of high quality voice-acting jobs, does a great job of conferring the intensity and danger of the nuclear dilemma at hand.\\" Game Revolution noted the strong production values of most of the FMV and while a minority had \\"back yard\\" production, they nevertheless used quality actors and \\"fairly impressed\\" the reviewer, though he criticised the \\"MTV-like editing\\". Edge also noted the \\"MTV-style presentation\\" and called it \\"stylish\\" and atmospheric. Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, Allgame praised the atmospheric music as \\"reminiscent of a large budget political spy thriller\\". The reviewer said: \\"what really cranks up the adrenaline and ramps up the immersion factor in the game is the great sound effects.\\" Allgame said the enjoyment \\"isn't bad\\", but limited: \\"You can only blow up so much stuff with a helicopter.\\" Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: \\"I'm happy to say that the much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike.\\" Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would \\"find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title.\\" GamePro assessed that \\"newcomers [to the Strike series] may find the action too involved, while Command & Conquer cadets may find the blast-and-fly-past strategy too simple.\\" Daily Radar said: \\"When it comes to creating an action game, it would be nice to play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do.\\" The website said: \\"if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go.\\" Kujawa argued that the game challenges the player to know which vehicle to use in each situation and manage their fuel, ammunition, and armor, and co- reviewers Crispin Boyer and Kelly Rickards agreed that the game is extremely challenging. Allgame summarised: \\"When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game.\\" The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the \\"perfect\\" difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a \\"too easy\\" structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer. Allgame felt Nuclear Strike \\"is really nothing more than a repackaged version of the earlier game\\". The reviewer felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV. GamePro similarly said it \\"is simply more of the same. Even with the enhancements, the game plays exactly like the previous strikes ...\\" Boyer likewise said it \\"looks and plays just like Soviet Strike\\", but his three EGM co-reviewers all contended that it fixed all of its predecessor's problems with sharper graphics, smoother scrolling, clearer mission objectives, a more intuitive map interface, and more craft to choose from. GameFan called Nuclear Strike \\"a tangible improvement over its predecessor\\" and \\"a more satisfying experience all round.\\" The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike, saying they \\"make for a far richer, more active playing experience.\\" He recommended it to Soviet Strike devotees, while Power Play recommended it for fans of action games. IGN wrote the game was a \\"fine example\\" of the series, also citing a broader range of vehicles over Soviet Strike. Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game's predecessor, saying \\"at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [...] It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same.\\" GameFan's reviewers called Nuclear Strike \\"the definitive strike game\\" and said it \\"trounces all other Strikes that have come before.\\" Previewing the PlayStation version, Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects, missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series. In its review, the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games, but felt the control system, explosions, helicopter sound effects to be excellent. Next Generation said: \\"Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike are certain to like Nuclear Strike even more\\", but said the games are almost indistinguishable. Game Revolution acknowledged the game is \\"basically the same rehash of its predecessors, but it stands as a great game on its own. Nuclear Strike is a definite buy for fans who haven't tired of the series, and at least a 'rent me' for those who have been locked in the closet and haven't played any 'Strike' games.\\" Edge said: \\"Fans of the series lusting after more above-viewed shooting action will naturally welcome this latest regurgitation. The seasoned gamer, however, will no doubt walk away with a feeling of déja vu.\\" Rick Sanchez reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Small flaws keep this from being perfect – target colors on the map can be confusing, for example – but overall, Nuclear Strike is a solid action game with a lot of variety and great play mechanics.\\" ==References * Category:1997 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Shooter video games Category:THQ games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in North Korea Category:Video games set in Russia Category:Windows games Category:PlayStation Network games ","title":"Nuclear Strike"},{"id":"35968744","text":"An example of the cottage orné: The Hermitage (Hanwell) Cottage ornéFrom the masculine French noun le cottage (Larousse French Dictionary) from the English word \\"Cottage\\", from the ancient French word cote, \\"a cabin\\". Used in modern French to denote \\"une petite maison de campagne rustique et elegante\\" or decorated cottage, dates back to a movement of \\"rustic\\" stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th century during the Romantic movement, when some sought to discover a more natural way of living as opposed to the formality of the preceding Baroque and Neoclassical architectural styles. English Heritage define the term as \\"A rustic building of picturesque design.\\" They often feature well-shaped thatch roofs with ornate timberwork. ==England== These buildings were generally built by the wealthy either as rustic retreats for themselves or as embellishments for their estates. They were not necessarily cottages in the usual sense of a small dwelling for the rural poor: examples range from the cluster of retirement cottages built by a Bristol banker for his retired staff at Blaise Hamlet to the expansive Royal Lodge, built by king George IV for his own use. Houghton Lodge, Hampshire is a fine example with beautiful gardens. The cottage orné is the archetypal \\"chocolate box\\" cottage, but many chocolate box cottages are attractive cottages of conventional purpose, in no way associated with the Romantic era cottage orné. ==United States== In the United States the style was exemplified by the use of rustic motifs with a picturesque use of lattice/trellis, fancy scrollsaw work, and lightweight porch supports. ==See also== *Bungarribee Homestead *Ferme ornée ==Notes and referencesFurther reading== *Lyall, S.

Within seven months, the construction costs had been recouped, and payments to tribal members began. By 1986, when a $750,000 renovation was completed to make Southgate the \\"most luxurious bingo hall in the state\\", the hall was being operated by British-American Bingo, Inc., which received 45 percent of revenues, with the remainder going to the tribe. Tribal members also made up 20 percent of the hall's workforce. Revenues had grown to $5.3 million in 1987. The tribe put the money toward items including youth recreation programs, college scholarships, and construction of homes. In 1994, the tribe took over operation of the bingo hall and renamed it as the Palace Indian Gaming Center. The tribe soon added slot machines, which grew in number to 385 as of 1997, despite ongoing efforts by the state to block them. In 2005, a major expansion was opened, and it was renamed as Tachi Palace. The seven-story Tachi Palace hotel The following year, a 7-story, 255-room hotel was opened on the property. The hotel is semi-circular, with plans for a second phase of construction to complete the circle. ==Sporting events== World Extreme Cagefighting hosted 22 mixed martial arts events at Tachi Palace, until it was bought in 2006 by Zuffa, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and moved its events to Las Vegas. The casino's entertainment director, Christian Printup, then created a new MMA promotion, Palace Fighting Championship. After Printup departed in 2009, the casino formed a new promotion, Tachi Palace Fights, in conjunction with Gladiator Challenge.

She also formed part of Catherine's notorious \\"flying squadron\\" (L'escadron volant), a group of beautiful female spies she used for the purpose of forming sexual liaisons with various powerful men at the French court thereby extracting information which would then be passed on to her. In about 1562 at Catherine's instigation, she became the mistress of Louis, Prince of Condé, brother of King Antoine of Navarre and one of the leading Huguenots in France. Two years later when Isabelle created a scandal by giving birth to his son whilst the court was on a royal progress, she was banished to a convent. She later married wealthy Tuscan banker Scipion Sardini, a favoured protégé of Catherine de' Medici. ==Family== Isabelle was born in Limeuil, France in about 1535, a daughter of Gilles de la Tour, Viscount of Turenne, Baron of Limeuil and Marguerite de la Cropte, Lady of Lanquais. She went to live at the court of King Charles IX where she became one of Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici's Maids of Honour. Isabelle was distantly related to Catherine through the latter's French mother, Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne.Van Dyke, Paul (1922). Catherine de Médicis. C. Scribner's sons. pp.308-309 ==Flying Squadron== Described as beautiful with blonde hair, blue eyes, rose-pink complexion and possessed of a \\"vivacious wit\\", she was immortalised in verse by the poet Pierre de Ronsard. He wrote that he \\"would like to give her as many kisses as there were leaves on the trees of the forest\\" Her outstanding good looks caught the attention of the Queen Mother who invited her to join her elite \\"flying squadron\\" (L'escadron volant), a group of attractive and talented female spies who were recruited to seduce powerful men at Court thereby extracting information which would then be passed on to Catherine and used as political leverage by the latter. Catherine was keenly aware of the power and influence women were able to wield over men - knowledge she had acquired from observing her late husband, King Henry II fall completely under the sway of his cultured mistress Diane de Poitiers.Strage, Mark (1976). Women of Power: The Life and Times of Catherine de' Medici. New York and London: Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich. p.118 She set out establishing this select group of about eighty beautiful ladies-in-waiting whom she had dressed at all times \\"like goddesses in silk and gold cloth\\". They took active roles in Catherine's fantastic spectacles and magnificent entertainments which were regularly put on for the benefit of the court. At one lavish outdoor banquet held at the Château de Chenonceau, the male guests were served by ladies with bared breasts.Knecht, R. J. (1998). Catherine de' Medici. London and New York: Longman. p.236 The members of the \\"Flying Squadron\\" were encouraged to form sexual liaisons with the most influential men at court on whom they would spy for the Queen Mother. Isabelle's first lover was Claude, Duke of Aumale, a member of the House of Guise, who were Catherine's greatest rivals. The duke was followed by Florimond Robertet, Catherine's secretary and a Guise associate. In about 1562 at Catherine's instigation, she seduced the prominent Huguenot, Louis, Prince of Condé, who was also the brother of King Antoine of Navarre. Antoine was the husband of Queen Jeanne of Navarre, another implacable adversary of Catherine and the political leader of the French Huguenot movement. Years earlier, Catherine had assigned another \\"Flying Squadron\\" member, Louise de La Béraudière de l'Isle Rouhet to attach herself to Antoine. This led Queen Jeanne to later denounce Catherine's court in a letter to her son, the future Henry IV of France, \\"Here it is the women who make advances to the men, rather than the other way around\\".Strage, p.153 Despite his mother's warnings about the brazen women who frequented the French court, Henry himself would succumb to the sophisticated charms of Charlotte de Sauve, whom author Mark Strage described as having been \\"one of the most accomplished members of L'escadron volant.Strage, p.185 Much to Catherine's satisfaction, Condé fell passionately in love with Isabelle, whose beauty and sensuality so ensnared him that he neglected to attend Protestant religious services at court. However, her dominance over him came to an end in May 1564 when she gave birth to his son in the Queen Mother's chamber at Dijon while the court was on a royal progress. The scandal threw Catherine into a rage. Although the ladies of her \\"flying squadron\\" were used for the specific purpose to act as spies by forming sexual relationships at court, they were required to be discreet, decorous in public and above all to avoid pregnancy at all costs. Isabelle added fuel to the fire by loudly proclaiming Condé as the infant's father and even went so far as to send the baby to him in a basket. Condé vociferously denounced paternity, and Catherine angrily dismissed her from court.Strage, p.131 Isabelle was forced to enter a convent in Auxonne. To justify Catherine's harsh treatment of her, it was claimed that Isabelle had attempted to poison her rejected suitor, the Prince de la Roche- sur-Yon as well as the elderly Constable of France, Anne de Montmorency.Foster, Theodore (1869). The London quarterly review, volumes 126-127. New York: Leonard Scott Publishing Company. p.101 In May 1564, Charles Robert de la Marck, count de Maulevrier, made a statement about Isabelle de Limeuil, claiming that she had offered to ally with him to poison their common enemy, Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon. He claimed that Limeuil felt persecuted by the prince, whom she alleged pressured his wife Philippes de Montespedon, who was the Première dame d'honneur responsible for the ladies-in-waiting, to control and oppress the ladies-in-waiting: \\"The said princess, at the behest of the said prince her husband, aside from the pains that she gave to all the maids of the Queen, seemed to have a particular animosity towards her and tried to verify whether she was pregnant, often tormenting her in front of the Queen on this matter and others.\\" Two months after Isabelle gave birth to his child, Condé's wife, Eléanor de Roucy de Roye died. He chose as his second wife, a young Huguenot of noble birth, Françoise d'Orleans-Longueville. By then he had broken completely with Isabelle who never forgave his rejection of her and his denial of her son's paternity. The baby did not survive early infancy and died on an unknown date. ==Marriage and issue== The courtyard of the Hôtel Scipion in Paris, the principal residence of Isabelle and her family Isabelle was eventually allowed to leave the convent and in 1567 at the age of approximately 32 she married one of Catherine's protégés. He was Scipion Sardini, a wealthy banker originally from Catherine's native Tuscany. Upon her marriage, Isabelle was styled \\"Madame Sardiny\\". She and her husband made their home at the \\"Hôtel Scipion\\", Sardini's mansion on the Rue Scipion in Paris which he had built in 1565. On 13 March 1569 Isabelle's erstwhile lover, the Prince of Condé was killed at the Battle of Jarnac during the Third War of Religion. When informed of his death, she tersely replied, \\"enfin\\" (\\"finally\\").Strage, p.142 Sardini was ennobled by Charles IX who created him \\"Viscount of Buzancy\\". This made Isabelle by marriage the \\"Viscountess of Buzancy\\". She bore her husband three sons and a daughter: * Nicolas Sardini, Siegneur de Prunay * Alexander-Paul Sardini (1574-1645), Baron of Chaumont-sur-Loire, Viscount of Buzancy; left descendants * Paul Sardini (died 1667); left descendants * Madeleine Sardini In 1600, the viscount purchased the Château de Chaumont whose previous owners included Catherine de' Medici and Diane de Poitiers. Isabelle and her husband, however chose to live at the Hôtel Scipion. Sardini was given the title of \\"Baron of Chaumont-sur-Loire\\" which was passed on to their second eldest son, Alexander-Paul upon his death. ==Death and legacy== Isabelle died in Paris on 25 March 1609 and was buried in Chaumont-sur-Loire the following 1 April. Sardini died the same year. She featured in Honoré de Balzac's satirical tale, La Chière nuictée d'amour in which her husband was the central character. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:French nobility Category:1535 births Category:1609 deaths Category:16th-century French women Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People from Bergerac, Dordogne Category:French ladies-in- waiting ","title":"Isabelle de Limeuil"},{"id":"35968991","text":"Shuimen Air Base (Simplified Chinese: 水门空军基地) is an air base under construction in China.

The term platonic crystal is formed by analogy to photonic crystals, phononic crystals, and plasmonic crystals. The name emphasizes a thin plate formulation, which is governed by a fourth order partial differential equation, as opposed to a second order equation which governs other types of crystals. There are also strong connections between platonic crystals and metamaterials. The study of platonic crystals is referred to as platonics and does not refer to the teachings of Plato or the Platonic solids. The term is now in common usage by multiple research groups in Australia, New Zealand, France, and the United Kingdom. ==Applications== The types of platonic structures that have been examined include arrays of perforations, arrays of pins, arrays of point masses, as well as periodic variations in the plate material itself. Platonic crystals have been shown to exhibit a number of behaviours similar to photonic crystals, including negative refraction, beam splitting, and wave trapping. They may also feature large stop bands where wave propagation is not possible through the crystal, as well as cloaking near degenerate band surfaces. Investigations into defective platonic crystals has also revealed strong energy localization effects within the defects, with high quality factors. Experimental work in platonics to date has shown promising results in cloaking and flat lens focusing of flexural wave energy. ==References== Category:Solid mechanics ","title":"Platonic crystal"},{"id":"35969065","text":"Nevin Stewart Scrimshaw (January 20, 1918 - February 8, 2013) was an American food scientist and Institute Professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Greenberg, and released by Allied Artists. It stars Rod Steiger as Al Capone. Steiger reportedly refused the producers' first offer to star in this film because he thought the initial screenplay inappropriately romanticized Capone and criminality. In an interview Steiger said, \\"I turned the picture down three times.\\" According to TCM, he agreed to play the role only after the producers agreed to rewrite. The finished film was noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject.\\"Rod Steiger Plays Villain Again; Now He Deglamorizes Capone\\", Deseret News, May 30, 1959, p. 8A. ==Plot== Chicago, 1919: A young Al Capone arrives to work for mob boss Johnny Torrio. He meets Torrio's top man, \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo, who runs business and politics in the First Ward while secretly on Torrio's payroll. Prohibition is enacted a year later, causing Torrio and other gangsters like Dean O'Banion, George \\"Bugs\\" Moran and Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss to compete for profits in bootleg liquor and beer. Torrio's rivals conspire to have Colosimo and his henchmen killed. A reform mayor is elected, so Torrio and Capone change their base of operations to Cicero, a few miles away. Capone also has O'Banion killed and makes a play for Maureen Flannery, the widow of one of Colosimo's men. Weiss and Moran return the favor by ordering Torrio to be shot. Capone retaliates by killing Weiss and forcing merchants throughout the city to pay for \\"protection.\\" A sergeant in the Chicago police, Schaefer, is promoted to captain and vows to end the bloodshed and extortion and put Capone behind bars. With the heat on from the cops, a crooked newspaperman named Keely tries to bribe Schaefer but fails. He persuades Capone to move to Florida until things cool down. From a safe distance, Capone masterminds the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, with several of Moran's men gunned down in a Chicago garage. Capone and Moran call a truce, but when he learns Keely has been helping a Moran plot to kill him, Capone ends the reporter's life instead. Maureen finally has her fill of Capone's corruption and violence, while Schaefer and the feds find a way to finally put Capone away—on charges of tax evasion, earning him 11 years at Alcatraz. ==Cast== * Rod Steiger as Al Capone * Nehemiah Persoff as Johnny Torrio * Fay Spain as Maureen Flannery * Joe De Santis as Big Jim Colosimo * Martin Balsam as Mac Keely (based on Jake Lingle) * James Gregory as Schaefer * Murvyn Vye as Bugs Moran * Sandy Kenyon as Bones Corelli * Clegg Hoyt as Lefty (uncredited) ==Production== Films based on the lives of real-life gangsters had been banned under the Production Code. This ban was lifted in the late 1950s leading to films like Baby Face Nelson (1957). J. Edgar Hoover criticised the film and a proposed movie about Pretty Boy Floyd was dropped. However, in 1957 Lindley Parons and John Burrows announced they would make a film about Al Capone for Allied Artists. Jack De Witt was assigned to write the script. The script was worked on by Mal Wald and Henry Greenberg who were known for doing true life stories, including an episode of Climax! about Albert Anastasia. Rod Steiger was cast in the lead. He had been reluctant to play the lead but was persuaded once he read the script. Fay Spain was cast off the strength of her performance in a TV play. Filming started 16 September 1958. \\"This isn't just another crime drama aimed at the sensational market\\", said Steiger. \\"I think its a good social document. It shows how an unscrupulous man can prey on society.\\"Leonard, W. (Nov 16, 1958). HOLLYWOOD SHOOTS CAPONE. Chicago Daily Tribune 9 ==ReceptionCritical=== Bosley Crowther in The New York Times commented that with so many old movies about Capone, it was uncertain whether a new one was needed, but that this film had the \\"modest justification\\" that \\"it has a strong documentary flavor and Rod Steiger is an odious skunk in the title role.\\"Bosley Crowther, \\"Ancient History of 'Al Capone'; Steiger Takes Title Role at Victoria, Documentary Flavor Marks New Film\\", The New York Times, March 26, 1959. Variety called it \\"a tough, ruthless and generally unsentimental account\\" and \\"also a very well-made picture.\\"\\"Al Capone\\", Variety, December 31, 1958. ===Box office=== The film won a Laurel Award as 1959's \\"Sleeper of the Year\\".1959 Laurel Awards at IMDB.com. It was the biggest new grosser at the US box office in May 1959 in third place behind Some Like It Hot and Imitation of Life. Its box office performance was described as \\"phenomenal\\" and led to Allied making a number of biopic gangster films including The Big Bankroll and The George Raft Story. ===Lawsuit=== Al Capone's sister sued the filmmakers for $10 million not securing permission to make the film, citing invasion of privacy. A judge ruled in the filmmakers' favor. Capone's sister, widow and son later sued Desilu and other makers of The Untouchables for six million dollars and lost that suit too. ==Gallery== File:Rod Steiger Al Capone 1.png File:Rod Steiger Al Capone 2.png File:Rod Steiger Al Capone 3.png ==See also== * List of American films of 1959 ==ReferencesOverview and ratings from TCM Category:1959 films Category:1959 crime drama films Category:1950s biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Biographical films about Al Capone Category:Allied Artists films Category:Films scored by David Raksin Category:Films directed by Richard Wilson (director) Category:Cultural depictions of Bugs Moran Category:Cultural depictions of Johnny Torrio Category:1959 drama films ","title":"Al Capone (film)"},{"id":"35969155","text":"Original publication A Wreath of Sonnets (), sometimes also translated as A Garland of Sonnets, is a crown of sonnets that was written by France Prešeren in 1833. It was published for the first time in the German-language Ljubljana newspaper Illyrisches Blatt (Illyrian Newspaper) on 22 February 1834. It consists of 15 sonnets and is enriched with acrostic in the concluding sonnet. In the crown, Prešeren tied together the motives of his own unhappy love towards Julija Primic with that of an unhappy, subjugated homeland. ==Content== In the seventh sonnet, Prešeren made something that was later seen as a prophecy of his own glory: referring to the ancient myth of Orpheus, he invoked the skies to send a new Orpheus to the Slovenes, the beauty of whose poetry would inspire patriotism, help overcome internal disputes, and unify all Slovenes into one nation again. In the eighth sonnet, he went on in exposing the reasons why such an Orpheus—the metaphor for high culture in general and poetry in particular—had not yet been produced by the Slovenes. Exposing a decidedly negative vision of Slovenian history, consisting of nothing but foreign invasions and internal disputes (\\"the roar of tempests o'er a home unkind\\"), he maintained that it was the lack of glorious deeds that had hindered the flourishing of poetry. But, he went on in the next sonnets, there was still hope for the renewal of Slovenian poetry and thus for the coming of an Orpheus that would unify all the nation with his gentle singing: Julija only had to \\"send rays from her eyes for their glory to renew\\". Prešeren's message was clear: if Julija accepted his advances, she would become the muse inspiring solemn poems which would bring a new high culture to the Slovenes and thus make them a nation again. ==Form== Besides the complex and sophisticated content, A Wreath of Sonnets has an interesting format, too: the last line of one sonnet becomes the first line of the next one, making all fourteen sonnets of the circle an intertwining \\"garland\\" of lyric poetry; one sonnet cannot exist without the other. The first lines of all the single fourteen sonnets form in turn another sonnet, called the \\"Master Theme\\" or the Magistrale. In the Slovene original, the first letters of every verse form the words Primicovi Julji, meaning \\"to Julija Primic\\". ==Reception== The poem was recognized as a masterpiece by Matija Čop, but it did not gain much recognition beyond the small circle around the Kranjska čbelica magazine. Moreover, Julija was unimpressed. Understandably, Prešeren moved to more bitter verses. ==Legacy== The work was translated into Russian in 1889, which had great influence on many poets, including Valery Bryusov. ==References== Category:1833 poems Category:Poetry by France Prešeren Category:Sonnets ","title":"A Wreath of Sonnets"},{"id":"35969160","text":"Luowang may refer to the following locations in China: * Luowang Township (罗王乡), a township of Kaifeng County, Henan. * Luowang, Yueyang (洛王街道), a subdistrict of Yueyanglou District, Yueyang, Hunan.

Early appearances of the grid format include work by Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevich and other artists belonging to the De Stijl and Constructivist movements. The grid format also features prominently in minimalist and conceptual art of the 60's and 70's. The art theorist Rosalind Krauss writes, \\"In the temporal dimension, the grid is an emblem of modernity by being just that: the form that is ubiquitous in the art of our century, while appearing nowhere, nowhere at all, in the art of the last one. In that great chain of reactions by which modernism was born out of the efforts of the nineteenth century, one final shift resulted in breaking the chain. By \\"discovering\\" the grid, cubism, de Stijl, Mondrian, Malevich . .. landed in a place that was out of reach of everything that went before. Which is to say, they landed in the present, and everything else was declared to be the past.\\" Other notable occurrences of the grid format include Sol Lewitt's modular structures, Chuck Close's photorealist grids and more recently in Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings.

The name, which translates as \\"Peninsula House\\", is a reference to the buildings setting on a narrow peninsula which extends from the east shore of the lake. The estate had previously been a royal farm known as Dronningegård and this name has long been associated with the locale. ==HistoryQueen Sophie Amalie=== Dronninggård was built in 1661 to manage the Crown's extensive holdings of farm land in the area. The farm belonged to Queen Sophie Amalie until her death in 1714. After that, the property was sold and changed hands several times but eventually it fell into a state of despair. ===Frédéric de Coninck === Frédéric de Coninck painted by Daniel Orme in 1799 The main building stood as a ruin when the estate was acquired by Frédéric de Coninck (1740–1811). Originally from the Netherlands, he had emigrated to Denmark in 1763 where he had set up a shipping company and made a fortune in foreign trade. He commissioned court architect Andreas Kirkerup to build a new house while the old building was rebuilt and converted into a farm. Dronninggård painted by Erik Pauelsen in 1785 When Frédéric de Coninck acquired the Moltke's Mansion (now known as Danneskiold-Laurvig Mansion) in Copenhagen in 1783, to serve as his new residence during the winter season, he commissioned the painter Erik Pauelsen (1749–1790) to create two large paintings and three overdoors with motifs of his Dronninggård estate. In 1804 Frédéric de Coninck built Frederikslund as a country home for his son Louis Charles Frédéric de Coninck (1779-1852).The building is located half a kilometer east of Dronninggaard and offered a view over Furesøen. It was designed by the French architect Joseph- Jacques Ramée (1764–1842). ===Later history=== Dronninggård painted by Heinrich Gustav Ferdinand Holm in 1826 After de Coninck's death at Næsseslottet in 1811, both the shipping empire and the Dronninggård estate was passed on to his son but the times were changing. Denmark was experiencing hard times after the state bankruptcy in 1813 and after de Coninck's company went bankrupt in 1821, Dronninggård had to be sold. The following owners generally preferred to reside at Frederikslund while Næsseslottet fell into neglect. In 1898, it was acquired by a consortium and turned into a hotel while most of the land was sold off in lots. However, the venue was no great success and in 1906 the property was sold to book publisher August Bagge. Later in the century the estate was acquired by Copenhagen Municipality and turned into a medical facility. In 1984 the Danish Red Cross used the building as their first refugee centre in Denmark. In 1986 it once again passed into private ownership and has now been turned into an office hotel. ==Architecture== Built in Neoclassical architecture style of Andreas Kirkerup (1749–1810), the main house consists of three storeys under a hipped roof with black-glazed tiles. The main facade is seven bays long. Of the original 18th century interiors, only the dining room has been preserved. ==Park and monuments== Næsseslottet with some of the surrounding parkland seen across the lake Frédéric de Coninck charged the Flemish landscape architect Jean Frédéric Henry de Drevon (1734-1797 with the design of the surrounding parklands. Drevon was inspired by the manor house gardens of southern England and created the first Romantic garden in Denmark. It was planted with exotic trees many of which still grow there today. The pavilions in the park are not from the original English garden. The park is also home to a number of monuments and decorative features. The sculptor Carl Frederik Stanley (c. 1738–1813) created several monument for the park, including one to trade and shipping. Johannes Wiedewelt (1731–1802) contributed with an obelisk and ornamental vases. The two pavilions and the stables were designed by Axel Berg (1856–1929) and are from about 1900. ==List of owners== * (1660-1685) Queen Sophie Amalie * (1685-1762) The Crown * (1772-1776) W. D. W.

Stat. § 940.225; sexual contact under Wis. Stat. § 940.225; stalking under Wis. Stat. § 940.32; damage to property under Wis. Stat. § 943.01; or a threat to do any of the above. A petitioner whose has experienced domestic abuse, under this definition, can file for either type of order for free. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.125, other forms of harassment for the purposes of obtaining a harassment restraining order include striking, shoving, kicking, or other physical abuse; or repeated intimidating acts. Petitioning for a harassment restraining order that does not qualify as domestic abuse requires the payment of a fee. ==Provisions and process== In Wisconsin there are similar processes for obtaining a domestic violence or harassment restraining order. The first step is ordinarily for the woman—the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence generally refers to petitioners as female as most are women—to file an initial petition with the court. It is free of charge to file a petition for a domestic abuse restraining order. The harassment restraining order sometimes requires a fee but this is waived if the abuse also qualifies as domestic abuse, which it often does. The matter is considered a civil, not a criminal, case and the petitioner has no automatic right to an attorney, although she can retain an attorney if she can afford one. The woman often begins the process under extreme stress and overwhelmed with emotion. She must provide a detailed written statement of the facts supporting the granting of the order. She may request that a temporary restraining order be granted for a period of up to 14 days. The temporary restraining order may be granted ex parte—without the abuser having the opportunity to appear in court. Unlike in some states, in Wisconsin an ex parte order can be granted on the basis of past abuse, with no further evidence of the likelihood of future abuse being needed. The woman will also request that a full hearing—at which the abuser will be present—be held to determine whether to grant a permanent restraining order. Wisconsin courts will have jurisdiction to hear the case if the petitioner resides in Wisconsin—even if the respondent does not also reside in Wisconsin. The overall process does not usually last more than three to four weeks. The temporary restraining order does not go into effect until it is served to the person being restrained. Serving the restraining order is the responsibility of the petitioner. Service can be carried out by the Sheriff's Department of the county where the harasser lives or works, or by any adult who is not a party named in the case. Judges are assigned to restraining order hearings on a rotating basis, with each judge handling restraining order hearings for one week every few months. At the full hearing, petitioners are seated on one side of the courtroom, and respondents on the other side. The hearing usually lasts about 15–30 minutes. At the hearing, both parties will have an opportunity to testify and present evidence, and the judge will make a decision. The permanent restraining order, if granted, may be in effect for up to four years, and the judge must, if granting it, grant it for as long as the petitioner requests up to four years. The order may also be granted, or extended, up to ten years if there is a substantial risk that the respondent may commit homicide or sexual assault against the petitioner. Respondents are supposed to be held by the bailiff for 15 minutes after the hearing ends to allow petitioners to leave safely, but this rule isn't always followed. An HRO or DARO can require the harasser to stop harassing the victim, and/or avoid the victim's residence or temporary place of accommodation. Like a DARO, subsequent to 17 April 2014, an HRO may also require that the harasser avoid all contact with the victim. ==GPS monitoring for respondents== Wisconsin is considering requiring GPS monitoring for all persons subject to a harassment or domestic abuse restraining order. At the present time, a pilot program will provide funds for testing such a program in some counties before it is implemented statewide. Once implemented, the program would make Wisconsin the only state in the country to order GPS monitoring for those who are under, but who have not violated, a restraining order. The program has not yet been implemented by the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), however. The DOJ claims that current law does not permit judges to order GPS tracking for those who have not violated a restraining order. The governor's office has pledged to tweak the language in the next budget so the program can go ahead. ==Punishment for violation== Law enforcement must make an arrest if they have probable cause to believe that the abuser has violated a HRO or DARO. Upon conviction, the penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a prison term of up to 9 months. Violators may be subject to global positioning system tracking based upon a risk assessment by the department of corrections. The victim may be referred to a domestic violence or sexual assault victim service provider. An exclusion zone will be created which the violator is not permitted to enter under GPS tracking. ==NCIC registration and firearms restrictions== The HRO or DARO will generally be registered in the Protection Order File of the National Crime Information Center. At the state level, a domestic abuse restraining order will automatically trigger a restriction on owning or possessing firearms. For a harassment restraining order, such restrictions are at the discretion of the judge granting the order and are not automatic. Federal restrictions on firearms may also apply. The NCIC entry will include a \\"Brady indicator\\" indicating whether the restrained person is prohibited from owning firearms under federal law, with a \\"Y\\" indicating yes (the restrictions do apply), \\"N\\" for no, and \\"U\\" for unknown. Generally the Brady indicator will be set to \\"Y\\" only if certain relationships exist between the parties, such as a sexual/romantic relationship or a parent/child relationship. If the restraining order does not specify the relationship, an attempt is made to determine the relationship from other available data before setting it to \\"U\\". The federal Brady indicator restrictions, which are automatic if, and only if, certain conditions apply are distinct from possible state restrictions on HRO or DARO respondents possessing firearms. For an HRO, a state restriction on the respondent possessing firearms will depend on whether the judge, at his or her discretion, feels the respondent is a risk to use a firearm to harm others, but it is not automatic. ==Types of Restraining Orders in Wisconsin== The domestic abuse and harassment restraining orders are among the several types of restraining orders used in Wisconsin. The DARO is similar to the HRO but requires that certain specific relationships exist or did exist between the parties. The child abuse restraining order is also similar but is used where the victim of the abuse is a minor. Unlike the HRO, both the domestic abuse and child abuse restraining orders carry an automatic requirement not to possess firearms under state law. The individual at risk restraining order is a restraining order designed to protect adults with significant impairment in their ability to care for themselves. The petitioner will sometimes have a choice as to whether to file a domestic abuse or harassment restraining order. The differences between the two orders have grown less over the years. In the past the penalties were less for violating a harassment restraining order, and a full no contact order could not be issued in a harassment restraining order hearing. A petitioner whose request for a temporary restraining order was denied was formerly entitled to a later injunction hearing only for domestic abuse restraining orders. If the respondent and petitioner shared a residence, the respondent could, in the past, not be ordered to avoid that residence under a harassment restraining order. These differences have been significantly reduced. Harassment and domestic abuse restraining orders now have the same penalties for violation, and a full no contact order can now be made in either case. The respondent can now be ordered to avoid the petitioner's residence in either case. A full hearing will now be granted in either case even if the temporary order is denied provided that, in the case of a harassment restraining order, the harassment also meets the definition of domestic abuse. The significant difference between the two types of orders that remains is the fact that the domestic abuse order carries an automatic firearms ban, while the harassment order does not. Sometimes petitioners who are eligible for both will opt for the harassment order because they don't want to force the respondents to give up their firearms. This can carry significant risks for petitioners, as guns are the most common cause of domestic abuse homicides in Wisconsin. Between 2000 and 2010, there were 213 domestic abuse murders in Wisconsin by guns, more than the 194 murders by knives, other weapons, or other means combined. As such, a petitioner stipulating to a harassment restraining order rather than a domestic abuse order must be questioned to the judge as to whether she entered into the stipulation voluntarily and understands the differences between the two types of orders. The petitioner must be fully informed of the consequences of opting for a harassment restraining order. Out of state orders, including from any state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, a tribal court, or a province or territory of Canada, may be enforced in Wisconsin with similar penalties for violation as if the out of state order was actually a Wisconsin domestic abuse restraining order. ==Petitioner success rates== A 2006 Wisconsin study showed that female petitioners were successful about 62 percent of the time in seeking restraining orders at the full hearing where the respondents had the chance to be present. The success rate appeared to be higher if the petitioners were represented by advocates or attorneys. The success rate is about 83 percent with an attorney and 32 percent without an attorney. In 2017 in Dane County, 393 petitions for a domestic abuse restraining order were filed, resulting in 186 long term injunctions being issued, for an overall petitioner success rate of about 47 percent. ==Support for petitioners== The University of Wisconsin Law School operates a clinic, the VOCA Restraining Order Clinic, to support petitioners for domestic abuse restraining orders in Dane, Jefferson, Rock, and Sauk Counties. The program is named after the Victim of Crimes Act. Under the program, second and third year law students provide support to petitioners, including writing petitions, appearing with them in court, and providing direct and cross examination services. The program is intended to improve success rates for petitioners as well as teach both legal skills and empathy to law students. Students will make a commitment to be involved with the program for a semester. During that time it is expected that they will represent two or three petitioners. The short time frame for restraining order hearings will allow students to see complete cases through to completion. The program is operated in partnership with domestic abuse agencies such as Domestic Abuse Intervention Services. The director of the clinic is Ryan Poe- Gavlinski. During the first year that the program was in effect, students helped 62 petitioners for restraining orders. The assistance was offered to varying degrees: some were represented in court while others were advised only by phone. In circumstances where the petitioner could not be represented in court, a trial prep meeting or call was arranged to help the petitioner prepare. Secondary trauma can be a concern for students and attorneys participating in the clinic and stress reduction techniques such as meditation are taught. Another program in Milwaukee County brings together the Sojourner Family Peace Center and the Marquette University Law School to provide support for petitioners through pro bono legal representation. A 2019 study of this program found that those with legal representation were more than twice as likely to have their restraining order approved, and were also more likely to appear in court to face their abuser. ==Effectiveness== Experts disagree on whether restraining orders are effective in preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law reviewed 15 U.S. studies of restraining order effectiveness, and concluded that restraining orders \\"can serve a useful role in threat management.\\" However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that restraining orders are violated an average of 40 per cent of the time and are perceived as being \\"followed by worse events\\" almost 21 per cent of the time, and concluded that \\"evidence of [restraining orders'] relative efficacy is lacking,\\" and that they may pose some degree of risk. A large America-wide telephone survey conducted in 1998 found that, of stalking victims who obtained a restraining order, more than 68 per cent reported it being violated by their stalker. Threat management experts are often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book The Gift Of Fear, well-known American security specialist Gavin de Becker characterized restraining orders as \\"homework assignments police give to women to prove they're really committed to getting away from their pursuers,\\" and said they \\"clearly serve police and prosecutors,\\" but \\"they do not always serve victims.\\" De Becker also observed that restraining orders are most effective when the emotional involvement is lowest—for example, when used following a brief, unsatisfactory, dating relationship as opposed to with an ex-spouse. In the case of stalking, de Becker advised that restraining orders are most effective if the woman rejects once, and then obtains the restraining order immediately following any further unwanted contact. If she continues to allow contact for an extended period after an initial firm rejection, any eventual restraining order may be less effective. ==References== Category:Wisconsin law Category:Sexuality in Wisconsin Category:Court orders Category:Harassment Category:Domestic violence ","title":"Domestic Abuse Restraining Order"},{"id":"35969430","text":"TekWar is a science fiction novel written by William Shatner and (uncredited) science fiction author Ron Goulart.

Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi published letters from Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò in which he exposed alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions in higher contract prices. Over following months, the situation widened as documents were leaked to Italian journalists, uncovering power struggles inside the Vatican over its efforts to implement greater financial transparency and comply with international norms to fight money laundering. In early 2012, an anonymous letter made the headlines for its warning of a death threat against Pope Benedict XVI. The scandal escalated in May 2012 when Nuzzi published a book entitled His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI consisting of confidential letters and memos between Pope Benedict and his personal secretary, a controversial book that portrays the Vatican as a hotbed of jealousy, intrigue and underhanded factional fighting. The book reveals details about the Pope's personal finances and includes tales of bribes made to procure an audience with him. ==Leaks== The scandal first came to light in late January 2012 in a television program named The Untouchables (Gli intoccabili), aired in Italy by broadcaster La7, and escalated in May 2012 when Gianluigi Nuzzi published a book entitled His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI consisting of confidential letters and memos. Among the documents were letters written to the Pope and to the Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, by then apostolic nuncio to the United States, Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, complaining of corruption in Vatican finances and a campaign of defamation against him. Viganò, formerly the second-ranked Vatican administrator to the Pope, allegedly asked not to be transferred for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions in higher contract prices. An anonymous document described a conversation with Cardinal Paolo Romeo of Palermo, Sicily, in which he allegedly predicted the Pope would be dead within twelve months. According to Allen, none of the information leaked seemed \\"especially fatal\\". \\"It's not so much the content of the leaks, but the fact of them, which is the real problem.\\"\\"Five questions about the Vatican's leaks scandal\\", Allen Jr., John L., National Catholic Reporter, 17 February 2012 ==Vatican internal investigation== The Vatican probe into the leaks worked along several tracks, with Vatican magistrates pursuing the criminal investigation and the Vatican Secretariat of State an administrative probe. In March 2012, Pope Benedict appointed a commission of cardinals to investigate the leaks. The three cardinals appointed by Benedict acted in a supervisory role, looking beyond the narrow criminal scope of the leaks to interview broadly across the Vatican bureaucracy; they purportedly uncovered a sex and blackmail scandal. They reported directly to the Pope, and could both share information with Vatican prosecutors and receive information from them, according to Vatican spokesman the Reverend Federico Lombardi. The group was headed by Cardinal Julián Herranz Casado, an Opus Dei prelate who headed the Vatican's legal office as well as the disciplinary commission of the Vatican bureaucracy before retiring. ==Papal response== On 30 May 2012, Pope Benedict made his first direct comments on the scandal in remarks at the end of his weekly general audience. He said the \\"exaggerated\\" and \\"gratuitous\\" rumours had offered a false image of the Holy See, commenting: \\"The events of recent days about the Curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart. ...I want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day, with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence, help me fulfill my ministry.\\" On 26 July, Pope Benedict held a meeting of the commission of cardinals. Also in attendance were the head of the Vatican police, the judges involved in the case, and representatives of the Vatican Secretariat of State, according to a report from Federico Lombardi. Months later, after Paolo Gabriele and Claudio Sciarpelletti—two Vatican aides—were convicted in the case, he pardoned them. ==Arrests and convictions== Paolo Gabriele, who had been the pope's personal butler since 2007, was arrested by Vatican police on 23 May 2012, after confidential letters and documents addressed to the Pope and other Vatican officials were found in his Vatican apartment. He seemed to have been leaking classified information to the journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. Similar documents had been published in Italian media over the previous five months; many of them dealt with allegations of corruption, abuse of power and a lack of financial transparency at the Vatican. Piero Antonio Bonnet, the Vatican's judge, had been instructed to examine the evidence of the case and to decide whether there was sufficient material to proceed to trial. Gabriele faced a maximum sentence of eight years for the illegal possession of documents of a head of state.Messia, Hada (CNN). Paolo Gabriele was indicted by Vatican magistrates on 13 August 2012 for aggravated theft. The first hearing took place on 29 September 2012. Gabriele's trial began on 2 October 2012. He claimed to have stolen the documents to fight \\"evil and corruption\\" and put the Vatican \\"back on track\\". Multiple evaluations of Gabriele's mental health provided conflicting results: one report concluded that Gabriele suffered from a \\"fragile personality with paranoid tendencies covering profound personal insecurity\\", while another found that Gabriele showed no adequate signs of a major psychological disorder nor posing any serious threat to himself or others. Vatican police seized encrypted documents and confidential papers that the Pope had marked \\"to be destroyed\\" when they raided the apartment of his butler, the court heard. On 6 October, Paolo Gabriele was found to be guilty of theft, and was sentenced to a reduced sentence of 18 months. He was also ordered to pay legal expenses. However, Gabriele served his sentence in the Vatican itself, as opposed to the usual arrangement of sending prisoners to serve time in an Italian prison, due to concerns that he might leak further secrets. Claudio Sciarpelletti, a computer specialist at the Secretariat of State who allegedly helped Gabriele, was arrested and convicted of obstruction of justice based on conflicting information he gave to prosecutors. He was sentenced to four months, which was amended to two months suspended with five years' probation due to his long years of service and lack of a prior criminal record. ==Aftermath of the investigation== One of the reasons listed for the dismissal of Ettore Gotti Tedeschi as president of the Vatican Bank was the \\"Failure to provide any formal explanation for the dissemination of documents last known to be in the president's possession.\\" On 17 December 2012, the Pope received a report on \\"Vatican lobbies\\" prepared by Cardinals Julián Herranz, Salvatore De Giorgi, a former archbishop of Palermo, and Jozef Tomko. The same day, the Pope reportedly decided to resign, a decision he made public in February 2013, becoming the first in 700 years to step down on his own volition. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI occurred on 28 February. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, speaking on Vatican Radio on 23 February 2013, strongly criticized media coverage of the report as a financial scandal which purportedly became, upon the cardinals' internal investigation, a gay sex and blackmail scandal as well. Although the dossier was available only to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and the investigators themselves, the latter were free to discuss the results of their investigation with the cardinal electors of the March 2013 papal conclave, and the dossier itself was to have been given to Benedict's successor, Pope Francis. On 1 March 2013, Lombardi reported that \\"two or three phones\\" had been tapped. On 12 June 2013, it was reported that leaked notes of a private conversation between Pope Francis and Catholic officials at the Latin American Conference of Religious confirmed the existence of \\"a stream of corruption\\", and that \\"The 'gay lobby' is mentioned, and it is true, it is there. ...We need to see what we can do.\\" According to La Repubblica, \\"Vatican investigators had identified a network of gay prelates.\\" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi made no comment on the remarks made in \\"a private meeting\\". In July 2016, the Vatican Court acquitted the two journalists involved in the \\"Vatileaks\\" trial, citing freedom of expression as its reason. Judge Giuseppe Della Torre, head of the tribunal of the Vatican City State, declared that \\"the court had no legitimate jurisdiction over Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi.\\" Monsignor Lucio Balda, by contrast, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for leaking official documents and his sentence began on 22 August in a cell within the confines of the Vatican. Requests for a papal pardon for Balda were met with silence, until Pope Francis granted him clemency after he served half his jail sentence. ==See also== *Vatican money laundering investigation *Financial Information Authority (Vatican City) *Carlo Maria Viganò *Ettore Balestrero *Index of Vatican City–related articles ==References== Category:Pope Benedict XVI Category:History of the papacy Category:21st-century Catholicism Category:Religious scandals Category:Crime in Vatican City Category:Document theft Category:2012 in Vatican City ","title":"Vatican leaks scandal"},{"id":"35969504","text":"Sanjay Chauhan may refer to: * Sanjay Chauhan (politician), mayor of Shimla Municipal Corporation * Sanjay Chauhan (screenwriter) (born 1962), Indian screenwriter * Sanjay Chauhan (cricketer) (born 1966), Indian businessman and cricketer * Sanjay Singh Chauhan (born 1961), Gujjar leader * Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan (born 1975), Indian film director and screenwriter * Sanjay Chauhan (soldier), Indian military captain who participated in 1994 Operation Rakshak * Lieutenant General Sanjay Chauhan, see List of serving generals of the Indian Army ==See also== * Sanjay (disambiguation) * Chauhan ","title":"Sanjay Chauhan"},{"id":"35969517","text":"Junonia schmiedeli is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

The tree can grow to 6 metres high, and has yellow-green, oval-shaped leaves, with white undersides and wavy margins. O. paniculata produces clusters of daisy flowers in late autumn. ==Description== Olearia paniculata is a small evergreen tree that is indigenous and commonly found in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It has reddish twigs bearing very smooth and wavy-edged oval green leaves that are white underneath and twigs that are grooved on the top surface and angular in cross-section. Olearia paniculata is a tree that can grow tall to about 6 meters tall. Olearia paniculata branchlets are grooved, sharp- cornered, very short and grow up to short lengths such as 2-4 centimeters . Flowers are small, white, and in dense clusters. Petiole of the akiraho plant which exists as a stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the stem which grows up to 5 millimeters long. It also has a white thin appressed white to buff tomentum below. Olearia paniculata also has a sweet smell to it and is looked at by many people as used for creating hedges. The genus is named after Johann Gottfried Olearius, a 17th-century German scholar and author of Specimen Florae Hallensis.Moench, Conrad. 1802. Supplementum ad Methodum Plantas. pp. 254-255. Paniculata, on the other hand, means “Small sprayed”. Olearia paniculata leaf margins can be flat or strongly wavy. == Range  Natural global range === Olearia paniculata is endemic to both the North and South Islands of New Zealand . === New Zealand range === Olearia paniculata is a small evergreen tree that is indigenous and commonly found in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It can be found in the East Cape to south Canterbury. It is not native to Taranaki but can be seen growing rapidly as a hedge plant. ==Habitat== Olearia paniculata is most likely to be found in non- local seed sources. The habitat includes a large amount of grass (c. 50% cover), with c. 3-m-tall plantings in clumps up to 5 m2. Akiraho is also commonly found around other shrubs, herbs, and ferns that are common on the forest floor. It is suited to dry soils and windy places which make it common in coastal areas. This species is not found in the naturally regenerating mature forest. Prefers full sun to partial shade with well-draining soil. Coastal conditions and dry windy situations, so it does not drown and kill the plant. It also tolerates moderate frosts but does not tolerate saturated soils. ==EcologyLife cycle/Phenology=== Olearia paniculata produces clusters of daisy flowers in late autumn. Akiraho is a plant that grows well after autumn rains as the soil is preferably soft and moist and warm which allows it to become well established before the winter season. Akiraho goes into the flowering stage between the months of March and May and goes into the fruiting stage between the months of April and July. ===Diet and foraging=== Olearia paniculata the evergreen shrub or tree, does need water to eat and grow but not too much water . With the leaf density of the evergreen plant, it can be important in promoting durability, water conservation, and protection from predators. The kinds of soil Olearia paniculata prefer is the soil after the autumn season rains as during this stage the soil is moist and warm which is just good for the species because it allows it to establish. It is important to plant Olearia paniculata into slightly raised beds of well- cultivated soil. Because this will create drainage that provides near-surface roots with aerated soil in which to grow. Like all other young plants, they require thorough watering during dry times over the first two or four years mulching which helps to better conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Often when Olearia paniculata is mixed with coarse sand, compost, or organic material it improves the soil's health and moisture structure. When planting Akiraho it is essential to ensure the root ball is saturated and when digging the hole make sure it is twice the diameter of the root ball and watered once being planted. ===Predators, Parasites, and Diseases=== Olearia paniculata has no known pests or diseases. However, predators such as goat, cattle and sheep would consider this plant a meal . ==Other information== Akiraho plant has sweet-smelling flowers. Pruning is not normally required for this plant when planted unless it is being planted as a hedge that’s when it will require regular trimming to encourage growth. ==References== paniculata Category:Flora of New Zealand ","title":"Olearia paniculata"},{"id":"35969533","text":"Hulsoff may refer to: *Barry Hulshoff, Dutch footballer *Maria Aletta Hulshoff, Dutch personality ","title":"Hulshoff"},{"id":"35969539","text":"Baliwan may refer to: * Baliwan, Henan, town in Kaifeng, Henan, China * Baliwan, town in Hong'an County, Hubei, China ","title":"Baliwan"},{"id":"35969551","text":"Junonia sophia, the little commodore or little pansy, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Speakers suggested that a thorough archaeological examination of the site for European artefacts associated with the early commercial maritime activities and later recreational bathing activities on the site should be included as part of any digging for the proposed inlet. Subsequent discoveries during the excavation process have included a set of timber poles and timber \\"steps\\", consistent with pier construction of the 19th century and the formwork for the Barrack Square retaining wall.

He has collaborated with Pandit Ravi Shankar, Anoushka Shankar and Amjad Ali Khan, and created the musical group The Taal Tantra Experience in 2002. ==Early life and training== He was born and raised in Kolkata, and studied at the South Point High School and subsequently graduated from the Scottish Church College.Some Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 591 His musical education began at the age of seven, learning vocal music from Pandit (teacher) Maharaj Banerjee, harmonium from Pandit Mantu Banerjee, and subsequently learning tabla. His training in the traditional Guru Shishya Parampara started with Pandit Kanai Dutta, after whose death Tanmoy became a ganda bandh shagird (disciple) of Pandit Shankar Ghosh. ==Career== Tanmoy Bose is one of the foremost musicians in contemporary world music and an indispensable member in the global fraternity of percussion. Bose received his early tutelage from the legendary Pt Kanai Dutta. Bose became the Gandabandh Shagird {formally initiated disciple in Indian classical music} of the noted torchbearer of the Farukkabad gharana –Pandit Shankar Ghosh. Even as early as being in college, he had the rare opportunity of being called upon by another musical legend, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan to perform with him. The association with this legendary maestro has been that of a family member for the last two decades performing with him so regularly. The ultimate milestone in Tanmoy Bose’s life was achieved when the greatest ambassador of Indian Classical Music Pandit Ravi Shankar invited him to play regularly with him around the world. He is currently a regular accompanying musician of Dr Lakshminarayana Subramaniam and Smt Kavita Krishnamurthy for their world music projects. Bose has been instrumental to take his rhythmic ventures into a new level. Over the last few years, his brainchild, TAALTANTRA has emerged as one of the foremost world music bands regularly enthralling audiences in the Mid-East, North America, Europe and India experimenting with timeless Jazz, Indian Classical Music, Folk Music and indigenous drumming. The name signifies “sadhana” or worship through rhythm. Even though Taaltantra essentially is not dealing with just drumming, it has elements of various instrumentation. The world of sound is the forte of the band which is worth experiencing. Another significant endeavour worth mentioning is RHYTHMANIA. Rhythmania incorporates Indian classical music coupled with Western and Mediterranean, Jazz world folk and a new age fusion Electronic Dance Music (EDM) which provides the perfect concoction that connects hearts globally. Bose has been an ardent researcher and composer. His long tours around the world had given him opportunities to interact and play with musicians, composers, choreography and the like he put to very good use his rich experience acquired hereby and created DHWANI, BEYOND BORDERS, TAALYAAGNA, CHATURANG and MOKSH - based on the virtues of Indian Rhythmic nuances. He has also been a very popular television presenter. He has couple of shows to his credits where he interacts with well-known Musicians, Film directors, Actors and Dancers. His Drumz Dreamz project & Hridmajhare are getting popular where it replays the concept of concept of community drumming and indigenous music respectively. He has a number of award winning films and music projects to his credit. For Tanmoy, music and life are inseparable. Rhythm is his quest of truth and beauty- it transcends all other priorities in his life. ==Discography== Maestros Studio Session-Times Music * Rabi Baul- Tagore and Folk with narration-Asha Audio * Tasher Desh- Indo Bangladesh production-Asha Audio * Taaltantra-1& 2.World Music -Times Music * Taaltantra Experience- World Music.-Ozella Music * Baul & Beyond-Folk/world music- Music Today * Navaras-Nine Moods/Orchestral-Hmv SaReGaMa * Solo Tabla- Traditional Indian classical-Bol Records * Full Circle: Carnegie Hall/Pandit Ravi Shankar- EMI * Anourag - Anoushka Shankar -EMI * Live at Carnegie Hall (Anoushka Shankar)-EMI * Rise -Anoushka Shankar -EMI * Traveler-Anoushka Shankar-EMI * Sarod Trilogy-Ustad Amjad Ali Khan/Amaan & Ayaan Ali Khan.-Bangash Music * Live at Carnegie Hall-Ustad Amjad ali Khan. * Ahiri-Indian classical/sarod Tejendra Narayan -India archive music * Charukeshi-Indian Classical/Sitar& Sarod Sujat hussain khan & tejendra narayan-India archive music * Living room sessions part-1/Pandit RaviShankar-East meets West Music * Desh & Puriya dhaneshree live concert in uk/ Vocal,Rashid Khan.-Navras records * Raga Unveiled-DVD Indian classical music * Raga Revelry-DVD Indian classical music * DRUM DREAMZ- CONTINENTAL DRUMMING.Percussion solos from some of the greatest percussionists from Brazil/Senegal/Iran/India/Europe.-TIMES MUSIC ==Awards and accolades== * Centre for Indian Studies, USA * Bengali Association of Greater Nashville, USA * Indo-American Cultural and Religious Foundation * Shree Venkateswara Temple of North Carolina, USA * Hafiz Ali Khan Memorial Society, Delhi * North Calcutta Junior Chamber * Salt Lake Cultural Association, Kolkata * Sangeet Piyasi, Kolkata * Alfa Bangla Sangeet Puraoshkar * Shilpan Academy yearly Sangeet Sammelan * Anti terrorism Cultural Protest of SPANDAN * ITC Sangeet Sammelan, Munger * South Point Golden Jubilee * Punascha – ST.Louis, USA * Shilpa Society * Jagari— Kolkata * UNICEF * Bhalobasi Tai Gai * Manjil * Dalhousie Athletics Club, Kolkata * South Point Ex-Student Association * Music World, Kolkata * Annual Sports Meet- Kolkata police * Sangeet Sanman, Govt. of West Bengal * Sangeet Maha SAMMAN, Govt of West Bengal ==References * Tanmoy Bose, Profile at last.fm * Category:Indian drummers Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Hindustani instrumentalists Category:Indian emigrants to the United States Category:Indian Muslims Category:Planet Drum members Category:Tabla players Category:Scottish Church College alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:National Heritage Fellowship winners Category:Musicians from Kolkata Category:Bengali musicians Category:Indian percussionists Category:American film score composers of Indian descent Category:American male musicians of Indian descent Category:American musicians of Indian descent Category:20th-century Indian musicians Category:Male film score composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Tanmoy Bose"},{"id":"35969588","text":"Rachel Robertson (born 20 July 1976) is a New Zealand field hockey player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of New Zealand Category:Field hockey players at the 2004 Summer Olympics ","title":"Rachel Robertson"},{"id":"35969594","text":"Junonia stygia, the brown pansy, dark pansy or Aurivillius' brown pansy, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

It connects Gau- Algesheim on the Left Rhine line () with Bad Kreuznach on the Nahe Valley Railway (Nahetalbahn) and is thus part of a regionally important transport corridor between the two state capitals cities of Mainz and Saarbrücken in the Saarland. ==History == During and after the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, there were a number of rail projects to facilitate the transportation of troops and war matériel to the French border. In 1871, the Prussian state railways opened the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn) from Bad Münster am Stein to Kaiserslautern. In 1879, a line from the Rhine-Main area parallel to the Nahe Valley Railway had already been discussed, but only at the end of the 19th century did it seriously figure in the War Department's plans. The Gau Algesheim–Bad Kreuznach railway was opened as a strategic railway on 15 May 1902. It used a short section of the Rheinhessen Railway from Worms via Alzey to Bingen between Büdesheim-Dromersheim and Gensingen-Horrweiler. In 1904, this was followed by a line on the east bank of the Nahe, connecting Bad Münster and Odernheim on the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn) independently from the existing Nahe Valley Railway. The section between Bad Kreuznach and Bad Münster was rebuilt with four tracks. The railway facilities in Bad Kreuznach were remodelled as part of the project. Kreuznach station was on the Nahe Valley Railway to the north of the city on the west side of the Nahe and Kreuznach Bad station was southeast of the centre of the town. On 25 February 1904, the town and the Prussian state railways agreed on the construction of a new central station at the junction of the two lines between the two old stations. Further consultation was required, partly because local residents and shopkeepers near the existing stations feared being disadvantaged and partly because the proposed name of the new station, Kreuznach Gabelung (“fork”) was considered a deterrent for tourism to the spa. The new station was opened under the name of Bad Kreuznach on 15 May 1905. The station building was inaugurated in 1908. In 1915, the Hindenburg Bridge was opened over the Rhine between Bingen and Geisenheim, also as a strategic railway. The line ran from Rüdesheim and Geisenheim to Münster-Sarmsheim on the Nahe Valley Railway and it was connected by a double-track connection at Ockenheim to the line from Gau-Algesheim. There was also a connecting curve east of Ockenheim to the line to Bingen. After the First World War, the Gau Algesheim–Bad Kreuznach railway became more important for passenger traffic. It was also served by express trains and in 1939 a pair of express trains ran between Saarbrücken, Frankfurt and Berlin on the line.1939 Deutsche Reichsbahn timetable Even after the Second World War, the line continued to be used by long-distance express trains until the 1990s. In 1945, the Hindenburg Bridge was blown up and the connecting lines to it were closed. The old railway embankments are partially preserved and the connecting curve from Ockenheim towards Bingen can be easily seen today between the fruit trees that grow there. ==Route == The line starts in Gau Algesheim station on the Left Rhine line and first runs to the west. Until 1945 it converged in Ockenheim station with the twin-track line connecting Bingen and the Hindenburg Bridge (VzG line number 3513), which ran for about three kilometres parallel to the Gau Algesheim–Bad Kreuznach line. The Gau Algesheim–Bad Kreuznach line crosses the Rheinhessen Railway and runs to Büdesheim–Dromersheim junction, where it joins the Rheinhessen Railway and they run together to the south. In Gensingen- Horrweiler station the two lines separate again. This once important station with three island platforms (each with two platform tracks) has now been reduced to a Haltepunkt (\\"halt\\", having no sets of points) with a platform track next to the station building and an island platform. The actual separation of the two lines has already occurred a kilometre to the north at Gensingen-Horrweiler junction; the single-track Rheinhessen line towards Alzey now uses only the easternmost of the three tracks. To the south-west, the line continues through Planig, which is no longer a station for passengers, on the east bank of the Nahe to Bad Kreuznach, where it converges with the Nahe Valley Railway in Bad Kreuznach station. ==Passenger services== There are no longer any long-distance services on this line. Today only two regional services run on the line, both hourly. Regional-Express service RE 3 stops on the line only in Bad Kreuznach and Gensingen-Horrweiler, while Regionalbahn service RB 33 stops at all stations. Between Büdesheim-Dromersheim station and Sonderlager siding also runs the RB 35 (Rheinhessenbahn) service also runs on the strategic line. {  ! Line !

It is popular as an ornamental in cultivation, especially in the form of its unique and colourful variety, \\"splendens\\". ==Etymology== The genus name Haworthia honors the British botanist Adrian Hardy Haworth (1767–1833), while the species name \\"magnifica\\" derives from the Latin word “Magnificus” meaning \\"magnificent”. ==Description== Haworthia magnifica is a succulent evergreen slow-growing species reaching a size of 40 cm in height. Its shape and brownish-greenish color serve to camouflage this plant on the ground. It is usually a solitary stemless plant. The leaves are approximately triangular, about 3,5 cm long, with longitudinal pale brown or greyish veines along the upper surfaces and small teeth along the edges. The leaves form a rosette of about 8 cm in diameter. Flowers are white and small, forming an inflorescence of about 40 cm. A plant of the type variety, showing the distinctive features of the species: dark colour, sharply pointed leaves, scabrid leaf surface, and faintly flecked striations. This highly variable species is one of the \\"retuse\\" species of Haworthia, meaning that it usually grows sunken beneath the ground with its flattened leaves only showing on the surface. Its rosette of succulent leaves are turned back (\\"retuse\\") so as to provide a flat and level face, on the surface of the ground. In this form, it is similar to other retuse haworthias (e.g. Haworthia pygmaea, Haworthia bayeri, Haworthia springbokvlakensis, Haworthia mirabilis, Haworthia emelyae and Haworthia retusa).http://haworthiaupdates.org/the-retuse-haworthias-1975/ It can usually be distinguished from its relatives however, by its dark green leaves which become purple in full sun exposure. (This species is almost as dark as its relative Haworthia maraisii.) The leaves have a scabrous (rough) sub-tuberculate, slightly translucent surface, covered in faint, parallel lines and sometimes light flecked markings. The leaves have rough margins, often with tiny spines, and have sharp tapering tips. ==Distribution== This species is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa. ==Habitat== It grows on bushes and rocks at an altitude of about 220 meters. ==Varieties== Near the Gouritz river, the slender-leaved forms - which were previously classed as a variety of Haworthia retusa - are now labelled as the variety \\"acuminata\\". The extremely dark (almost black) plants, with rounded leaf tips and extremely rough leaf surface, are known as variety \\"atrofusca\\". In the north-east of this species range, the variety \\"dekenahii\\" is distinguished by its blunt- tipped leaves which have prominent silver flecks and tubercles. In the far east of its range, the plants have copious light-coloured fleck-markings, and the variety \\"splendens\\" is named from these plants.http://haworthiaupdates.org/haworthia-revisited-18-haworthia-magnifica/ * Haworthia magnifica var. acuminata (M.B.Bayer) M.B.Bayer * Haworthia magnifica var. atrofusca (G.G.Sm.)

He and his family fled the country shortly before the Fall of Saigon. He never received any formal training in filmmaking, but instead grew up watching the films of director Alfred Hitchcock, including 1958's Vertigo and 1963's The Birds. Nguyen went on to be a software salesman in Silicon Valley. He first picked up a camera in 1999. In 2003, he directed the low-budget romantic film Julie and Jack. In 2005, he directed the science fiction thriller Replica, inspired by Vertigo, but it was not released until 2017; Nguyen blamed the outcome on the expensive storyboarding process and his casting decisions. Nguyen's popularity as a director rose in 2010 with the release of the film Birdemic: Shock and Terror. He was inspired to write the script for the film while spending time relaxing in Half Moon Bay, California, and much of the filming took place in the area surrounding the community. The film's under $10,000 budget was financed with his own income. Nguyen has cited The Birds and An Inconvenient Truth (2006) as inspiration for directing Birdemic. During and since its release, Birdemic has been frequently considered to be one of the worst films of all time. Birdemic was featured as a movie riffed on by the cast of RiffTrax both as a standalone product and during one of their live shows, drawing further attention to the film and Nguyen. In February 2012, Nguyen began production on a sequel to the film, entitled Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. The film was released in 2013 to negative reviews. In a 2016 Vice interview, Nguyen said that he is hoping to eventually make Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle, which would be his last film in the Birdemic series.The Worst Movie Ever Made? The True Story of 'Birdemic' Nguyen attempted to crowdfund for the film, first launching a project on Indiegogo which only raised $596 of its $500,000 goal and later on Kickstarter only raising $230 of its $200,000 goal. Due to the gain in popularity with Birdemics showing through RiffTrax, Nguyen agreed to allow RiffTrax to give a similar treatment to his unreleased Replica. The un-riffed version was available through RiffTrax in January 2017 and the riffed version was released on February 10, 2017. ==FilmographyAs director=== * Julie and Jack (2003) * Replica (2005) * Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010) * Birdemic 2: The Resurrection (2013) ==References * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Horror film directors Category:People from Da Nang Category:Vietnamese emigrants to the United States Category:Vietnamese film directors ","title":"James Nguyen"},{"id":"35969676","text":"McDaid is a surname.

As a result, fourteen prominent members of the UVF were imprisoned, including Graham.\\"Abstracts on Organisations - 'U'\\", CAIN.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 11 November 2015. Graham was targeted for assassination by the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and on 10 October 1991 an IPLO unit entered the Diamond Jubilee bar on Graham's native Shankill Road and shot a patron dead. However the man they killed was Harry Ward, a 42-year-old Protestant Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member whom they mistook for Graham.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company, Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2004, , p. 103Sutton Index of Deaths 1991 On 14 January 1993, Graham was hit by rifle shots, fired through the window of his home. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) claimed responsibility.The Irish Emigrant , emigrant.ie, 18 January 1993. The attack led to a number of other leading loyalists turning their homes into miniature fortresses for fear that they too would be targeted.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 219 Graham has been named on several occasions as the incumbent UVF Chief of Staff, and as such holding Brigadier- General rank: for example, by Pat Rabbitte, and by campaigner Raymond McCord.David Gordon, \\"McCord: British government colluded with terrorist organisations and should apologise\\", Belfast Telegraph, 17 December 2009.

Raymond McCord claimed, in a statement to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, that Graham had acted as an \\"agent of the state\\". In 2000, amid a violent UDA-UVF feud, Graham was involved in talking to hardliners in the UVF and dissuading them from escalating the conflict.Wood, Ian S. (2006).
