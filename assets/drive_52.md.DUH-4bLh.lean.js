Though of little importance in the context of the Irish whiskey industry, the distillery is remarkable for having existing for over a quarter of a century in an area notorious for the production of poitín, an illicit spirit. ==History== In 1814, William Leathem established a small distillery at Bohillion, just outside Burt, Co. Donegal. The distillery, though not large, was notable for being the only licensed distillery to have operated with any degree of success in Donegal, an area renowned for the production of Poitín, an illicit spirit. To differentiate his product from the Poitín produced by the illicit stills, Leathem produced a high quality whiskey from grain, which was aged for a least a year. This contrasted with the local Poitín, which although of good quality, was generally produced from a mix of barley and molasses and sold within a few weeks of being distilled. In addition, Leathem developed an export trade with England. The precise history of the distillery is difficult to piece together. However, records show that in 1821, the distillery was operating a 49 gallon still, and that output in 1828, reached 53,873 gallons of proof spirit. In 1834, Leathem gave important first-hand testimony before a Government inquiry on illicit distilling practices. In his testimony, Leathem was very critical of the excise administration, in particular, on their practice of posting incompetent English officers to Ireland. Although Burt Distillery had initially succeeded in competing against its illicit rivals, by the 1830s, it also faced competition from two large scale legal distilleries which had emerged in nearby Derry. As a small scale operation without economies of scale, it appears that Burt Distillery could not compete on both fronts, and the distillery closed in 1841. It is not known what happened to the distilling equipment. However, the distillery buildings themselves were retained in use well into the 20th Century. One of the distillery buildings, is still extant, and is currently used as a farmyard building. With a prominent chimney, it can be seen by passing motorists on the N13 from Derry to Letterkenny, a silent reminder of Burt’s distilling heritage. === Bibliography === * * == See also == * Irish Whiskey * Poitín == References == Category:Defunct distilleries in Ireland Category:1814 establishments in Ireland Category:1841 disestablishments in Ireland ","title":"Burt Distillery"},{"id":"56670733","text":"Afghanistan–France relations refers to the diplomatic relations between Afghanistan and France. ==History== Afghanistan and France established diplomatic relations in 1922.

In 1928, Afghan King Amanullah Khan paid an official visit to France. In January 1943, during World War II, France closed its diplomatic legation in Kabul. As a result, Afghanistan closed its diplomatic legation in Paris in 1944 when Vichy France declined Afghanistan's diplomatic legation dual accreditation to France and Switzerland. Soon after the war, both nations re-opened their legations and upgraded them to embassies in 1949.Histoire de l'ambassde In 1965, Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah paid an official visit to France and met with President Charles de Gaulle. In 1968, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou paid an official visit to Afghanistan. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan starting the Soviet–Afghan War. For the next 25 years, relations between both nations became nearly nonexistent. After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, the French government announced in January 1990 that it would reopen its embassy in Kabul.https://books.google.com/books?id=f5wcH0abSQcC&pg;=PA8&lpg;= Years later the Civil War and Taliban stopped relations once again.

This draft resulted in publication of the manifesto entitled Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken, Leiden, aangenomen bij besluit van de Provinciale Vergadering van de Gewapende Corpsen in Holland, op 4 oktober 1785 te Leiden (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of Regent and Citizen). It contained an exposition of the Patriot ideology and arrived at the formulation of twenty proposals of political reform in a democratic vein. The ideas were only realized to a large extent under the Batavian Republic, when they inspired the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but they were earlier also influential in the intellectual history of the French Revolution thanks to the French translation the journalist Antoine Marie Cerisier, a collaborator of Mirabeau, published in 1788. According to American and British historians Jeremy D. Popkin and Jonathan Israel this French translation may have influenced the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. ==Background== The American Revolution made a deep impression in the Dutch Republic of the 1770s. Intellectuals like Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol and his friend François Adriaan van der Kemp disseminated the ideas of Thomas Paine, Richard Price, Andrew Fletcher and Joseph Priestley, and generally news about the accomplishments of the American revolutionaries. On the one hand this helped convince Dutch public opinion to support the American Revolution, but on the other hand undermined the autocratic government of stadtholder William V and his Orangist party of Regenten. The public support of the American revolutionaries helped bring about an armed conflict with Great Britain, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, which was mishandled by the stadtholder to such an extent that the criticisms of his regime gained wide support under the population. His opponents were found in circles of the old anti-Orangist (\\"States party\\") faction among Dutch regents, and among adherents of democratic ideals. These came together as a political movement that called themselves \\"Patriots\\". As the stadtholder controlled the armed forces: the Dutch States Army and the Dutch Navy, the Patriots started to arm themselves by forming citizen militias, known as exercitiegenootschappen (so-called, because they liked to train themselves by the performance of military drills). These were local militias, overlaid by a federal association that bound them together and made them a national force to be reckoned with. The regime saw this as a threat and tried to discourage their operations where possibleisrael, pp. 1098-1106. On 23 July 1785 (as one example) the city government of Leiden prohibited the activities of the Leiden exercitiegenootschap and fined its drill master. This elicited a reaction by both the local and the provincial militia: they organised a congress of representatives of Holland militias that convened on 8 October 1785 in Leiden in the meeting room of the Society Kunst wordt door Arbeid verkregen (Art is the result of Labour), one of the Patriot clubs in LeidenCf. Postma, op. cit. ==Genesis of the manifesto== At this congress a draft of a manifesto was adopted that became known as the Leiden Ontwerp (which is often translated into English as \\"Leiden Draft\\"The Dutch word Ontwerp may be translated as both \\"draft\\" and \\"design\\". But in this case ontwerp may be used in both meanings, because the document was a draft of a political design of a new Dutch constitution.). Who exactly wrote this draft is not entirely clearCf. S.R.E. Klein and J. Rosendaal, Democratie in context. Nieuwe perspectieven op het Leids Ontwerp in: De Achttiende Eeuw, vol. 26 (1994), pp. 71-100. However it is likely that the members of the commission that was charged by the congress with the writing of a final document, also had had a hand in the original draft. These were the journalist Wybo Fijnje (brother-in-law of the Leiden publisher of the French-language Dutch newspaper Gazette de Leyde, Jean Luzac, a friend of American ambassador John Adams), the Leiden textile manufacturer Pieter Vreede, and the Overijssel aristocrat Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck. They edited the final draft that was published as Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of Regent and Citizen) by the Leiden publisher Leendert Herdingh. It was so popular that in May 1786 a third edition was already necessary. The journalist Gerrit Paape later wrote that a copy of the manifesto was in almost everybody's hand.Cf. Postma, op. cit.; Schama, pp. 95 ==Main points== In the 68 pages of the document first an exposition was given of the main ideas behind the \\"design\\" into which the argument issued. That argument may be summarized by giving the headings of the sections of the paper (in translation): 1\\\\. Necessity of the preservation of the originally good Constitution, by correction of the abuses that have slipped in 2\\\\. The stadtholderate not a sufficient means for the repair of the original Constitution 3\\\\. The detrimental and offensive fact of the independence of the Regents from the people, whose representatives they are 4\\\\. What has much contributed in later times to enlarge the detrimental effects of the independence of the Regents 5\\\\. Dangers to which the Regents are subject in case they don't want to enter into the project of reform 6\\\\. Dangers to which the independence of the Regents subjects the liberty of the Citizen 7\\\\. Advantages of this Reform for the Regents 8\\\\. Rights of the People in relation to Petitions 9\\\\. Necessity of the Constitutional Reform in relation to National Defense 10\\\\. Necessity of a Constitutional Reform for improvement of public morals and for economic growth 11\\\\. Conclusions from the above arguments as foundations of the Reform, and correct stipulation of everybody's rights The argument resulted in an enumeration of twenty numbered articles: I. Freedom is an inalienable right of all Dutch citizens. No power on Earth can impede them to make use of that Freedom II. This Freedom would be illusory if it would not be founded on the right to be governed under laws to which the citizens have consented, either in person, or by their representatives III. These representatives must not be independent of those they represent, and their appointment by the People according to a constant and regulated system is an appropriate means to prevent such independence IV. The return of this right of appointment to the People must consist of either annual election by the People of municipal magistrates, or at least the nomination of the candidates from which the magistrates co-opt new members of the magistracy V. Though sovereignty ultimately belongs to the People, for practical reasons government must be left to state colleges and departments. The People retain the right to influence government by petitions and addresses. To enable the People to do this in a reasoned form they have to be informed by a Free Press and have to enjoy Freedom of Expression that may not be subject to prior restraint, though it may subject to judicial sanction after the fact VI. Everywhere the Regents promote this Constitutional Reform they may not be deprived arbitrarily of their existing offices, unless those offices contravene this new Constitution, or one person holds two incompatible offices VII. The People will have to leave the officers they have elected to do their job during their time in office and to give them their trust VIII. The officers of the Municipal Militias will be elected by their members and in case the regulations declare government and military offices incompatible, those regulations will be scrupulously observed IX. Nobody will be eligible for government office who has not served in a militia X. Citizen-commissioners will be appointed to audit the public accounts and to guarantee the exercise of rights XI. There will be regular accounts of the Public Finances on all government levels XII. Citizen-commissioners will have the right and duty to investigate matters concerning industry and trade and to recommend policies pertaining to those matters to the government XIII. Citizen-commissioners will not step down from their posts all at once, but only a part of the membership will be renewed periodically XIV. Though the state has to make expenditures for the maintenance of infrastructure and those expenditures must therefore not suffer undue austerity, the People have the right to demand the abolition of useless and costly institutions and practices, with just compensation for the holders of the abolished rights and offices XV. The electors of Magistrates must be the members of the militias, unless this right of election belonged to the Guilds XVI. To avoid the problem of electors selling their vote, the right of election will be reserved to people with a certain position of wealth, depending on local circumstances XVII. Regulations may be made as to the qualifications of both electors and their representatives XVIII. Petty offices should preferentially be given to people of exemplary behavior, military veterans, and people originating locally (instead of people from abroad) XIX. Civic militias should be promoted so as to support the Army against foreign enemies and to oppose that Army in case it becomes the instrument of domestic tyranny XX. To serve those two purposes the citizens should be divided in three classes, whose members, selected by drawing lots, will have to serve in the militia in rotation ==Influence== A close reading of the Design will teach that the editors of the document revered the existing \\"constitution\\" of the Dutch Republic (in the sense of a body of foundational charters and treaties, like the Great Privilege, the Pacification of Ghent, the Union of Utrecht, the Twelve Years' Truce, and the Peace of Münster), but rejected a number of \\"abuses\\" that had recently \\"slipped in\\" like the so- called Regeringsreglementen (Government Regulations) that had been adopted in the course of the Orangist Revolution of 1747 to give the stadtholder a right of appointment, or at least approval, of city magistrates. The Patriots wanted to roll back these recent reforms and replace them with the right of the citizenry, just below the caste of Regenten, but above the \\"lower classes,\\" to elect those magistrates, or at least nominate candidates for co-option by the vroedschappen that traditionally had the right to elect them. In other words, they implicitly accepted the existing \\"constitution\\", with its special political rights for the Regenten, but put a new reading on it, \\"clawing back\\" so to speak the \\"ancient\\" rights of the guilds and schutterijen to influence local government, and through its intermediary, regional and national government. To justify this they proclaimed a popular sovereignty that was to replace the sovereignty claimed by the provincial States and the States- General (another of those \\"abuses\\", as the sovereignty of the States was always supposed to be derived from \\"the People\\"). The Leiden Draft therefore was not only a declaration of principles, but also a political program of overturning, not the political structure of the Republic, but the composition of the personnel occupying the magistracy with the use of more or less \\"democratic\\" elections. The Patriots soon started to put this program in execution, beginning in the city of Utrecht where the old government was replaced with a democratically elected one. Soon other city governments in especially Holland, Utrecht province, Overijssel and Friesland went over to the Patriot side, usually, however, by having Orangist regents replaced by adherents of the old States party, whose families had been driven out in 1747, but had taken up the explicit invitation in the Leiden Draft to cast their lot with the democrats. Sometimes, however, even those old-style regents were replaced by representatives of the middle-class citizenry (like in Utrecht, Leiden, Delft and Rotterdam), breaching the traditional monopoly of political office of the Regent class. This \\"attack\\" on their position started to disturb the Patriot regents, who gradually started to drift away from their more radically \\"democratic\\" brethren in the Patriot movement. But the wave of democratic reform seemed unstoppable when in the Summer of 1787 the Amsterdam vroedschap was overturned after large street demonstrations of the local Patriot clubs and the Patriot exercitiegenootschap. This went too far for the old-style regents, a number of whom started to move over to the camp of the stadtholder. However, it took military intervention by the king of Prussia, brother of the wife of the stadtholder and hence his brother-in-law, to suppress what had become the Patriot Revolution in the Fall of 1787. After this the personnel changes in the city governments and the States were reversed and the post-1747 system restored, in a more severe form, under the 1788 Act of Guarantee that seemed to cast the stadtholderate in stoneSchama, pp. 95-135. The Patriot Revolution therefore seemed to be stopped in its tracks, and rolled back, but that did not imply that the influence of the Leiden Draft also had forever dissipated. The 1770s and 1780s were a time of intensive contact and exchange of ideas across European frontiers by like- minded intellectuals. Among those involved were the French journalist Antoine- Marie Cerisier, who had been in the center of the Patriot Revolution, and therefore, like many other leading Patriots had to go into exile in France. There he became a close collaborator of Mirabeau, the trailblazer of the French Revolution, who took a keen interest in political developments in the Dutch RepublicMirabeau wrote a pamphlet, entitled Aux Bataves sur le stadhouderat in 1788, in which he articulated part of a delcaration of rights and commented on the suppression of the Patriot Revolution and advised the bataves to try again soon; Cf. Jourdan. Cerisier did not write the Leiden Draft himself as Popkin has it Jeremy Popkin, Dutch Patriots, French Journalists and Declaration of Rights: the leidse ontwerp of 1785 and its Diffusion in France, The Historical Journal, vol. 38 (1995): pp. 553-65; but Popkin later acknowledged that Cerisiers role was less important in the writing of the Leiden Draft; Cf. Jeremy D. Popkin, Antoine-Marie Cerisier; le Leidse Ontwerp et le Grondwettige Herstelling un debat encore ouvert in: De Achttiende Eeuw, vol. 29, no. 1 (1997), pp. 17-34, but excerpted it in French in an articleA.-M. Cerisier, Extrait du plan général de réforme concerté par les patriotes hollandois, in Analyse des papiers anglais no. 75 (15–18 Aug. 1788) in Analyse des Papiers Anglais in 1788Cf. Jourdan, notes 19 and 21. According to Popkin, who conducted extensive archival research into the matter, this excerpt eventually influenced the formulation of the Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen of 1789, one of the foundational documents of the French Revolution. In a 2007 orationJonathan Israel, In strijd met Spinoza (Vierde KB-lezing; Amsterdam 2007), Jonathan Israel supported this thesisPostma, pp. 39-40. And so the \\"path of influence\\" of the Leiden Draft eventually doubled back to the Netherlands, because the exiled Patriots returned with the triumphant armies of the Revolutionary French Republic in 1795 and this time definitively overturned the old Dutch Republic and its institutions. Again, the political method of the Leiden Draft program was used by working ostensibly \\"within\\" the old constitution, by taking over the personnel of the old institutions like the States of Holland that was in a \\"constitutional\\" way replaced by the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland, and the States-General that for a while became the States General of the Batavian Republic, before it legislated itself out of existence at the end of 1795 to be replaced by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic. One of the first official acts of the Provisional Representatives was the promulgation of the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, that was drawn up by a commission, chaired by Pieter Paulus, which certainly took the Leiden Draft into account as one of its inspirationsSchama, pp. 95, 211-214. ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ==Sources== *Jourdan, A., The \\"Alien Origins\\" of the French Revolution: American, Scottish, Genevan, and Dutch Influences, in: J. of the Western Society for French History, vol. 35 (2007) * Israel, J.I.

It was originally planned for Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell to appear in supporting roles in the film, before both had become stars by that point and other actors were cast. The film was adapted from a (1901) David Belasco stage play of the same name. ==Premise== Simon Levi, a Jewish immigrant pawnbroker builds up a successful business. His daughter Ruth marries stockbroker Richard Eagan. They are swindled by stockbroker Paul Groode, and forced to labor in the streets to make financial ends meet. Eventually, they achieve retribution against Groode and the movie ends happily for the stockbrokers. ==Cast== * George Sidney as Simon Levi * Marian Nixon as Ruth Levi * Gareth Hughes as Richard Eagan * Doris Lloyd as Esther Levi * Ward Crane as Paul Groode * Sammy Cohen as Mo * Claire McDowell as Mrs. Tim Eagan :Source: ==Release== The film was a serious financial disappointment for the Fox Film company. Made on a budget of $304,000, it took $317,000 worldwide which led to a $106,000 loss once distribution cost are factored in. This was the worst performance by a Fox film that year. ==Reception== The Film Daily wrote, \\"The David Belasco stage play became famous more for the acting of David Warfield than for the importance of the play itself and so the picture becomes entertaining because of the characterization of George Sidney rather than for the story it tells. The theme is slight and of the familiar Abie's Irish Rose variety. But Sidney's fine acting, his typical Jewish humor, plus a quantity of first class comedy incident, makes the picture satisfying. The introduction of the kangaroo offers one of the best laugh sequences of the picture. There is the usual heart interest twist and the happy ending.\\" Moving Picture World said, \\"So far as the plot interest is concerned it is considerably drawn out and moves forward rather slowly. More emphasis has been placed on the comedy but it is principally on the characterization of George Sidney that the audience appeal depends, and he certainly gives an excellent performance... This simple little story is rich in human interest and emotional appeal and George Sidney gives a performance that alternately plays upon the emotions and keeps the spectator in smiles.\\" Variety wrote, \\"The Auctioneer has enough in its favor to make it a worthwhile major house booking. It is a wholesome picture, has comedy and pathos. Photographically it is splendid [...] Sidney stands out all the way and the continuity gets a gouge here and there to permit him a few extra comedy bits. The theme is deftly handled\\". Writing for Chicago Daily Tribune, Mae Tinee wrote, \\"The Auctioneer is a homely, heartsome picture that will linger pleasantly in your memory\\" and commented that a fighting kangaroo was the funniest thing in the film. A review in the Woodward Daily Press of Woodward, Oklahoma said, \\"Alfred E. Green, who directed the production, took advantage of every opportunity to make the picture more life-like and human, at the same time losing none of hte spirit of the original play. It is, according to advance reports, one of the best pictures of its kind ever produced and promises to create as big a sensation as the play\\". ==References== ==Bibliography== * Solomon, Aubrey.

Starring Xuxa Meneghel, Marcos Pasquim, Juliana Knust, Paulo Vilhena, Sérgio Hondjakoff, Natália Lage, Zezé Motta, Bruna Marquezine, Milton Gonçalves and Sérgio Malheiros. Xuxa lives a biologist in a town near the Amazon Rainforest. Alongside the brothers Riacho and Manhã, she seeks the lost city of Igdrasil, which according to legend was founded by descendants of Vikings who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and ventured down the Amazon River. Director Góes developed the script based on influences from films such as Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark, other influences include Allan Quatermain's Lost City of Golds and William Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. In addition to containing references of Inca and Scandinavian mythology, Brazilian folklore (in the figure of Curupira) and patriotic-environmental pedagogy, used in the territorial defense of the Amazon. The film debuted on December 17, 2004, in 320 rooms in Brazil. It performed well at the box office, grossing R$7 million reais with more than 1,331,652 million box offices. Tesouro da Cidade Perdida received widespread criticism from critics and audiences. == Plot == Barbara (Xuxa Meneghel), a timid and monosyllabic biologist, lives in Beirada D'Oeste, a fictional city bordering the Amazon rainforest. She leads a gang of heroes who will stop at Igdrasil, a legendary underground city, populated by descendants of Vikings that crossed the Atlantic and plunged into the Amazon River. Barbara confronts Igor (Marcos Pasquim), her ex-husband, with whom he restrains his passion and interrupted romance, and leads the heroes, with two brothers of 8 and 9 years, dangerous, dangerous and disgusting to reach Igdrasil. in the capture of the villain, who stole from Igdrasil the sacred treasure, which is astonishing as well as valuable. As a token of the encounters and disagreements of the heroes and villains that lead to the lost city and its treasure, there is the Curupira, a magical personage of the Brazilian folklore, that fulfills the functions of Puck, personage of the Nordic folk of the piece A Midsummer Night's Dream, of William Shakespeare, the basis of our plot. In addition to being a (well) free adaptation of this classic Shakespeare comedy, Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida is also an adventure film with elements of fantasy mixed with historical facts and events, as well as moments of danger, suspense, emotion, romance and mood fit for people of all ages. == Cast == * Xuxa Meneghel as Bárbara / Deusa Blomma * Marcos Pasquim as Ígor * Juliana Knust as Jéssica * Paulo Vilhena as Lisandro * Natália Lage as Helena * Sérgio Hondjakoff as Demétrio * Zezé Motta as Aurora Hipólito * Milton Gonçalves as Hélio Hipólito * Sérgio Malheiros as Thor * Bruna Marquezine as Manhã * Peter Brandão as Riacho * Leandro Hassum as Bunzão * Márcia Cabrita as Flauta Morena * Luiz Carlos Tourinho as Curupira * Rocco Pitanga as Márcio Hipólito * Marina Ruy Barbosa as Mylla * John Klarner as Léo * Glaucio Gomes as dr.

Once again the direction is of Moacyr Góes, also responsible for the previous film of Xuxa, \\"Abracadabra\\". The script is by the playwright, writer and director Flávio de Souza. Souza and Góes became influential in Indiana Jones' Raiders of the Lost Ark to create the concept of the film, other influences include Allan Quatermain's Lost City of Golds and William Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. In addition to containing references of Inca and Scandinavian mythology, Brazilian folklore (in the figure of Curupira) and patriotic-environmental pedagogy, used in the territorial defense of the Amazon. Xuxa struggles against the clandestine exploitation of biodiversity in the role of a scientist with divine powers. The main message of the film is the defense of biodiversity, with attacks on the covetousness of Americans in relation to the Brazilian Amazon. \\"The ecological theme is fundamental and is of interest to Xuxa. Today, nothing is as important as the appreciation of the ecosystem,\\" reflects Góes. The name of the fictional underground lost and legendary city of Igdrasil, populated by descendants of Vikings. It was created on the basis of a Norse mythology, which means \\"Tree of Life\\". On criticism of his films, Xuxa countered. \\"If my films are blockbusters because they are seen by a lot of people, then I want to continue doing this. I do not want to make a movie that is praised (for criticism) but nobody wants to review it,\\" says TV hots. According to the producer, Xuxa is silent on the new film for a script option.\\" Xuxa questioned this:\\"I, who speak so much, will be monosyllabic?...,\\" she said, and she was even a little worried. In a booklet of O Tesouro da Cidade Perdida, the presenter philosophizes on the question: \\"The message I want to spend in this film is not so expensive, since having a respect for nature is one of the lines I did not have in any dialogue, I want to make it clear that when we respect every living thing, every little animal, every plant, everything in general, we are respecting everything that God has done and gave us the best. \\"Xuxa has enjoyed this story of being an introverted woman who suddenly discovers that she is a woman, and that she is a very goddess.\\" The scriptwriter has his version: \\"In \\"Abracadabra\\", Xuxa played a character who spoke a lot, this time Barbara is very shy and monosyllabic. Xuxa liked this story of being an introverted woman who suddenly discovers that she is a goddess. The total budget Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida, was R$6 million reais and debuted in 320 rooms in the country. Director Góes (2003) says that although she does not consider herself an actress, he likes her interpretation: \\"Xuxa has a great presence on screen, lending her characters a lot of authority. Since she does not pretend to be an actress, she puts a lot of her personality into her characters.\\" Actress Natália Lage, who lives Helena in the film, pointed out that children's audiences are seldom targeted by national film productions: \\"The responsibility for making films of this category is much greater because it is a public in formation,\\" he notes. To interpret Igor, the love interest of Tesouro da Cidade Perdida, was chosen the actor Marcos Pasquim. Before filming the scene of the kiss, says Xuxa, she asked Pasquim how he would like her to do, how could be the kiss. The actor decided on the famous technical kiss and when he approached Xuxa she said: \\"Do you smoke?\\". Unappealing, Pasquim left the scene and came back with a bunch of bullet in his mouth. \\"The first time was like kissing an ashtray, but then I kissed the actor,\\" Xuxa said. Other actors that participate in the cast are Juliana Knust (Jéssica), Paulo Vilhena (Lisandro), Natália Lage (Helena), Sérgio Hondjakoff (Demétrio), Zezé Motta (Aurora Hipólito), Milton Gonçalves (Hélio Hipólito), Sérgio Malheiros (Thor). ==Release== The premiere took place on December 11, 2004, at the SP Market Mall in São Paulo.

Mario Fanatic Abadde of the site Omelete gave a bad note to the film, justifying that the script of the film is \\"weak and insipid\\" because according to him \\"tries to put together a handful of images played with perfunctory performances.\\" Perhaps the screenwriter Flávio de Souza, knowing that with this (Juliana Knust), Lisandro (Paulo Vilhena), Helena (Natalia Lage) and Demetrius (Sergio Hondjakof). It's a lesson in how to assassinate a William Shakespeare classic.\\" A Cineclick critic also criticized the script for the film, writing that \\"it shows a series of ill- explained parallel stories and poorly constructed characters.\\" praising only the participation of the character Curupira, in which he defined as \\"a Gollum (Lord of the Rings) tupiniquim.\\" Giving a five-star. Jurandir Filho of the site Cinema com Rapadura, criticized the script of the film for being \\"Very bad! On paper it looks beautiful, but on the screen of the cinema is horrible.It is a mixture of parallel stories without notion and in the end you do not understand anything\\". For him the script is \\"extremely childish, can not be charismatic for adults (can not even swallow) and in the end, the older (13 years and above) will realize that it is just another Slot machine, as well as the films of former hit artist Didi. He defined Xuxa's performance as \\"lousy,\\" and Bruna Marquezine as \\"pitiful.\\" Writing that the actress \\"is badly used in this film, as are most of the actors.\\" just praised the performance of actor Sergio Malheiros writing that \\"he fulfills his role reasonably. Like Milton Gonçalves and Zezé Motta who are there just to give some credibility to the production. Cléber Eduardo of Contra Campo, wrote that Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida \\"reaffirms and accentuates the heroine's condition of the hots- actress: if in two previous films she saw elves, already sketching a mystical trait of the goodness of her persona, mysticism is promoted to divinity, but without any rupture with reason.\\" A Cineweb writer, he criticized the influence of William Shakespeare in the script writing that \\"it suits just for pretext to tell a love story involving the persongaens of the film.\\" Paulo Santos Lima, of IstoÉ, criticized the director of Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida, writing that he \\"dared, but he did not do it. And whose fragmentation of approaches creates distancing with the public, which he does not even know what it is; the infantile fable of Duendes and Abracadabra and also not sagacious enough for adolescents.\\" he still wrote that \\"Xuxa is lost between the children's audience and the youth in a plot run by Moacyr Góes.\\" Claudio Szynkier, writing to Folha, criticized the concept of fatherhood set out in the film \\"full of disappeared, rejected or cretin parents: a dark and strangely symptomatic idea of culture in which there is an authority of the image (in this case, Globo TV) playing paternal role. a system that also provides for the collage of synthetic fragments of a film imaginary: Indiana Jones grafted here, \\"The Goonies\\" there, all as fuel structural, fast consumption, for the film floor. The audiences surveyed for Adorocinema gave the film 4 stars out of five, with a score of 3.8 points. The Filmow site gave an average rating of 1.9 points to Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida. ===Box office=== The Xuxa box office forecast and the Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida was to account for between 2 million and 3 million viewers. However, the film reached a lower number than expected with 1,331,652 million box offices, the second most watched national film in the year after Two Sons of Francisco, and the 20th most viewed of the year in Brazil, with a gross of more of 7,108,730.00.Ranking 2005 (por público).

The authority serves over 25,000 customers in seven municipalities and also provides wholesale water to other water authorities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. The NWWA was established by the borough of North Wales in 1951 and has expanded its service area since then. ==Service area== The NWWA serves over 25,000 customers across seven municipalities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. In Montgomery County, the NWWA serves the borough of North Wales, most of Montgomery Township, most of Upper Gwynedd Township, most of Lower Gwynedd Township, part of Whitpain Township, and part of Upper Dublin Township. In Bucks County, the NWWA serves part of New Britain Township. In addition to providing water to customers in its service area, the NWWA provides wholesale water to other water authorities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. Water authorities that receive wholesale water from NWWA include the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority, the Doylestown Township Municipal Authority, the Horsham Water and Sewer Authority, the Warminster Municipal Authority, the Warrington Township Water and Sewer Department, and the Warwick Township Water and Sewer Authority. ==Governance== The NWWA is a municipal authority that consists of a five-member board of directors appointed to staggered five-year terms by the North Wales Borough Council. The authority is governed by an executive team that consists of an Executive Director, a Solicitor, and Engineer of Record. As of 2018, Robert C. Bender is the Executive Director of NWWA. ==Water supply== Lake Galena, which stores water that is treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant Much of the water delivered to customers by the NWWA is treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont, a facility that is owned jointly with the North Penn Water Authority (NPWA). The water treated at this plant comes from the North Branch Neshaminy Creek, which flows into Lake Galena, a reservoir for the water treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. Water released from Lake Galena flows down the creek to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. During the summer months and times when water levels are low, additional water is pumped from the Delaware River at Point Pleasant and diverted to the North Branch Neshaminy Creek near Gardenville. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant is the largest water treatment plant in Bucks County and processes up to 40 million gallons water a day for delivery to NPWA and NWWA customers. From the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant, a main carries water to the NWWA service area, where it is delivered to customers. ==History== The NWWA was established as a municipal authority by the borough of North Wales in 1951 to take over the privately-owned North Wales Water Company, which served 1,200 customers at the time. The NWWA expanded its service area into Upper Gwynedd Township and Lower Gwynedd Township in order to provide water service to those areas. After a drought hit the area in 1964, the authority expanded its service territory into Montgomery Township. In the late 1960s, the NWWA acquired the Blue Bell Water Company, which added Whitpain Township to its service area. The authority acquired the Upper Dublin and Delaware Valley Industrial Water Companies in 1979, which expanded its service area into Upper Dublin Township, including the office parks in Fort Washington. The NWWA expanded its service area into New Britain Township in Bucks County in the 1980s. In 1987, the NPWA and the NWWA began construction of an Interim Treatment Plant at the present location of the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont. The interim plant opened in February 1989 and supplied 3.2 million gallons of water a day. Construction of a permanent Forest Park Water Treatment Plant to supply 20 million gallons of water a day began in June 1991. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant began operation on June 21, 1994. An expansion to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in 2007 increased the output to 40 million gallons of water a day to keep up with the growing water use of the area. On July 30, 2019, Warrington Township agreed to sell their water system to the NWWA for $17 million. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Water companies of the United States Category:Municipal authorities in Pennsylvania Category:Companies based in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania ","title":"North Wales Water Authority"},{"id":"56671492","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; text-align: left; font-size: 90%; vertical-align: middle;\\" + List of accolades received by Darkest Hour - colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  150px Gary Oldman's performance earned him several wins and nominations in the Best Actor categories. -  colspan=3  { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" width=100% ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background-color: #D9E8FF; text-align: center;\\"  Accolades - - bgcolor=#D9E8FF  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Award  style=\\"text- align:center; background: #cceecc; text-size:0.9em\\" width=50 Won  style=\\"text-align:center; background: #ffccdd; text-size:0.9em\\" width=50 Nominated - align=\\"center\\" ;AACTA International Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Academy Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Alliance of Women Film Journalists   - align=\\"center\\" ;American Society of Cinematographers   - align=\\"center\\" ;Art Directors Guild   - align=\\"center\\" ;Austin Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;British Academy Film Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Chicago Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;Critics' Choice Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;Detroit Film Critics Society   - align=\\"center\\" ;Dorian Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Empire Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Evening Standard British Film Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Florida Film Critics Circle   - align=\\"center\\" ;Georgia Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;Golden Globe Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Hollywood Film Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;IGN Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;IndieWire Critics Poll   - align=\\"center\\" ;London Film Critics' Circle   - align=\\"center\\" ;Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild   - align=\\"center\\" ;New York Film Critics Circle   - align=\\"center\\" ;Online Film Critics Society   - align=\\"center\\" ;Palm Springs International Film Festival   - align=\\"center\\" ;San Diego Film Critics Society   - align=\\"center\\" ;San Francisco Film Critics Circle   - align=\\"center\\" ;Satellite Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Screen Actors Guild Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Seattle Film Critics Society   - align=\\"center\\" ;St. Louis Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;Toronto Film Critics Association   - align=\\"center\\" ;Vancouver Film Critics Circle   - align=\\"center\\" ;Visual Effects Society Awards   - align=\\"center\\" ;Washington D.C.

Green and starring Herbert Marshall, Virginia Bruce and Gene Reynolds.Stephens, Michael L. (2008). Art Directors in Cinema: A Worldwide Biographical Dictionary. McFarland, p.23. The plot is about an unlikely U.S. Senate page boy whose misadventures in Washington, D.C., cause a Congressional scandal. Based on a story by Jeanne Spencer and Albert Benham, the film was originally conceived in 1940 as a sequel to Columbia Pictures' hit film of the previous year set in the United States Senate, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, with Mickey Rooney in mind for the part of a juvenile delinquent who becomes a Senate page. Gene Reynolds eventually got the role of the page when filming began in 1941. Virginia Bruce plays a female radio reporter covering the Capitol Hill beat, who fights for acceptance as a legitimate journalist in a male-dominated arena. Herbert Marshall's character as a prominent Senator eventually comes to appreciate her insights into human nature as well as her skill and they become close friends. The film's sets designed by art director Lionel Banks were acclaimed for their attention to detail. It was released in Britain under the alternative title of Female Correspondent. ==Plot== Jim O'Brien (J. M. Kerrigan), an old friend of highly regarded U.S. Senator John Coleridge (Herbert Marshall), prevails upon the Senator to take under his wing a streetwise orphaned delinquent, teenager Marty Driscoll (Gene Reynolds), and appoint the youth as a Senate page boy. Because the boy's father had once helped Coleridge get his start in politics, the Senator reluctantly agrees. Marty continues to be a troublemaker as a Senate page, acting as a smart-aleck around the other pages and in their school classes. He resents having to wear the knickers required as part of the Senate pages' uniform at the time,Gonzalez (2010), p. 83. contending \\"I gave up short pants years ago\\". Told that it's a Senate tradition, he says, \\"I always thought knickers was for kids\\" (a scene depicted in the movie poster). He even gets into a fistfight with another page on the Senate floor (when the Senate is not in session) over a harmless initiation prank the other boys had played on him. Virginia Bruce (\\"Jane Scott\\") Young Driscoll begins to mend his ways when he is befriended by female radio commentator Jane Scott (Virginia Bruce), whom he first met in the Senator's office. After being scolded by senior page Collins (Charles Smith) and upbraided by Sen. Coleridge for his disgraceful behavior, Driscoll seeks Jane's advice on how he can win approval. The two go bowling together, at her suggestion. In between frames, she counsels him not to use his fists to get his way, but instead to take advantage of the privileged opportunity he has been given as a Senate page to develop the personal qualities that will gain him the respect of others and develop into a leader for the right reasons. Heeding her advice, Marty's attitude improves markedly and he develops newfound pride in being a page and in wearing his uniform, much to the delight of Sen. Coleridge. However, when Marty is later wrongly accused by page headmaster Bundy (Vaughan Glaser) of eavesdropping on a private meeting of Senators and leaking confidential information, Sen. Henry Owens (Samuel S. Hinds), the senior Senator from Coleridge's state, demands that Coleridge dismiss Marty and send him home. Marty, with tears in his eyes, pleads with Coleridge not to fire him, protesting his innocence and vowing he would never betray his oath of fidelity as a Senate page. Distraught at being disbelieved by Coleridge and unjustly terminated, Marty finds himself an outcast sitting on a park bench in Washington. He decides to get revenge on Coleridge by turning over privileged information about an upcoming major defense appropriation bill being considered by Coleridge's committee to businessman Frank Conroy (Pierre Watkin). The unscrupulous Conroy, hoping to profit in the stock market from gaining this inside information, gives Marty a bribe. Meanwhile, the other pages rally to Marty's defense and appeal to Coleridge and Owens to reconsider their decision. Convinced by their sincerity, Coleridge informs his young protégé that the page appointment is his once again. Realizing that his reinstatement is jeopardized by what he has done, Marty hastens to Conroy's apartment in New York, offering to return the bribe money and begging him not to divulge the contents of the appropriations bill. Too late, Conroy replies, he's already shared the inside information with his group of investors, who hope to make a killing in the stock market. When the bill's provisions are subsequently publicized without committee approval, the stock prices of certain defense-related companies soar. The resulting uproar embroils Sen. Coleridge in controversy and he is investigated by his Senate colleagues for sharing nonpublic information with investors, a violation of Federal law. When Marty learns that his misconduct has landed his mentor in serious trouble, he is conscience-stricken and hitchhikes back to Washington, where he bursts into the investigating committee's hearing room to explain that he alone is to blame for the scandal. Although his full confession exonerates Coleridge, there remains the issue of what to do about Conroy's illegal conduct and Marty's complicity. The committee votes to indict Conroy and, at the urging of Coleridge, agrees to allow Marty's fate to be decided by his fellow pages. Meeting in the Senate chambers, one of the pages calls for Marty's dismissal because he's shown himself unfit to be a page. But another page, Abbott (Dickie Jones, who also played a page in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington), comes to his defense, pointing out that, unlike themselves who came from privileged backgrounds with loving parents who set a good example, Marty's lack of these advantages and his voluntary confession should be taken into consideration. After the pages decide that Marty may continue as one of their own, the film's final scene concludes as he rises to express his gratitude for their forgiveness. The reformed page gives a tearful peroration saying he's learned from those he's met there how to be an upstanding citizen, and especially that American representative democracy is government \\"of the people, by the people, for the people\\", as he recites from memory The American's Creed. ==Main cast== Herbert Marshall (\\"Senator Coleridge\\") * Herbert Marshall as Sen.

The Senate gave permission for its pages to travel to Hollywood for filming in the summer of 1940, but those plans fell through as World War II engulfed Europe. After Mickey Rooney turned down the role of Marty Driscoll, 17-year old Gene Reynolds was cast for the part by the time shooting began on February 12, 1941.. Retrieved July 24, 2018. Considerable attention was paid to authentic set design for the Senate chamber, including accurate reproduction of the Senators' desks and other furnishings, down to the snuff boxes at the Vice President's rostrum. Female lead Virginia Bruce prepared for her role as a radio commentator by practicing the delivery style of fast- talking radio personality Floyd Gibbons. For the bowling sequence, she spent two days in a bowling alley rehearsing and shooting the scene, using a special, lightweight ball made of balsa wood. Filming wrapped on March 24, 1941. Adventure in Washington was released on Memorial Day, May 30, 1941. ==Critical response== Not all members of Congress were pleased with the film's depiction of life on Capitol Hill, especially its scenes of fistfights and eavesdropping by pages. Congressman Donald McLean (R-NJ), in a speech in the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced the film's portrayal of things that didn't happen in real life. Having once been a Senate page himself 40 years before, he said it \\"undermine[d] the confidence of the electorate\\". International distribution of the film was not allowed by the Office of Censorship because of concerns that the storyline's portrayal of the bribing of a Senate page would \\"hinder the war effort\\". The Ames (Iowa) Daily Tribune praised the cast's performances and the film's relevance about defense spending \\"at a time when the eyes of the nation are centered on defense\\", as WWII raged in Europe and tensions were rising between the U.S. and Japan. The newspaper lauded the cast as \\"splendid ... [having] roles calling for the utmost in their not inconsiderable talents\\". Actors Herbert Marshall and Gene Reynolds (\\"a new boy star\\") \\"possess roles of exceptional merit and provide performances to match\\", and Virginia Bruce gave a \\"memorable characterization\\" of the assertive reporter, the review said. The Atlanta Constitution in a June 1, 1941, review called Adventure in Washington \\"thrilling\\" and complimented the production for the extent of detail in the sets representing the Senate chamber and page classrooms, down to the desks \\"and even the snuff boxes at the rostrum\\". IMDb gives the film an aggregate score of 5.8/10, as of July 24, 2018.. Retrieved July 24, 2018. ==Home media== Adventure in Washington was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment as part of Sony's Choice Collection in 2013. ==ReferencesCategory:1941 films Category:1941 drama films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films directed by Alfred E.

The cutscenes take place in the form of comic strips. == Development == The game includes the voice of former Alice Cooper guitarist Kane Roberts and well as Alice Cooper himself. Post-retirement from the music industry, Roberts began production on three computer games, one of which was The Lords of Tantrazz. In April 1996, a press release wrote that the title was set for the 3rd quarter of that year. When the game was released, Alice and Kane did promotional appearances for the game, though no word on Kane's other two projects was ever offered to the public. == Reception == A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that \\"The game is so static it comes across more like a CD-romic than an actual game, especially since you can count the number of puzzles on the fingers of one hand.\\" He found the non-interactive elements of the game to be insultingly poor as well, particularly that the story has no ending, only a teaser for a sequel. Gamezilla recommended the game only to fans of Alice Cooper, though cautioned that Cooper doesn't really have an impact until the very end. CDMag described it as a B level game. Techtite thought the game had the core design of Myst, but with all the enjoyment stripped away.

The conservation park occupies land in sections 276, 279 and 479 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Comaum on the eastern side of the portion of the Riddoch Highway between Naracoorte in the north and Penola in the south. The following two adjoining sections have been excluded from the extent of the conservation park and thereby form indentations to its northern and southern boundaries – to the north, Section 389 was used in 1990 as a stone reserve by the then District Council of Penola for roadworks and to the south, Section 275 was used as a sand quarry. It was proclaimed as a national park on 12 November 1970 under the National Parks Act 1966 with the name, Glen Roy National Park. On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Glen Roy Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. , it covered an area of . In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant because it was a “remnant of open forest and seasonal swampland, displaying considerable diversity” and “provides important habitat for a wide range of species typical of the faunal assemblage of south- eastern South Australia.” In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of three areas each with their own vegetation associations: #Most of the conservation park consist of “undulating consolidated calcarenite dune ridges overlain by red, weakly-structured sandy soils generally associated with open forests of brown stringybark … and pink gum… , and unconsolidated dunes overlain by bleached sands with a yellow-grey B horizon, generally associated with brown stringybark.” #Land in the conservation park's west was subject to “periodic inundation” and support “low-lying river red gum … woodlands.”, #In the east, “interdunal swamps” were present and these had “black, organic soils overlying clay or marl, and support Leptospermum juniperinum closed heath and areas of sedgeland.” Fauna species observed within its boundaries as of 1990 include the red-tailed black cockatoo, the Yellow-footed antechinus and the common wombat. As of 1990, visitation was described as “low” and that “most” of these visitors were “field naturalists.” The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== ==External links== *Glen Roy Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website *Glen Roy Conservation Park webpage on the Birds SA website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Glen Roy Conservation Park"},{"id":"56671634","text":"The Headquarters Park Historic District encompasses the summer headquarters for the Leo Sheep Company, which focused on wool production, and the Rocky Mountain Sheep Company, which concentrated on lamb production, in Carbon County, Wyoming.

Before the outbreak of Civil War, he had served as a diplomatic representative, first in the North, and then replacing George Buckley-Mathew in Charleston, who was causing diplomatic problems. In particular, Mathew was vocally against South Carolina's recent rule of incarcerating British African sailors while in port. ==Life== Robert Bunch was from 1841 to 1845 attaché and private secretary of William Pitt Adams in Bogotá and Lima. In September 1844 he was sent together with Captain Sir Thomas Thompson as Joint Commissioner to the Supreme Junta of Government of Peru to Arequipa. On December 16, 1845 he was appointed Consular Agent in Lima. On February 6, 1846 he was appointed acting consul in Callao (Peru). Robert Bunch was vice-consul in New York City from October 25, 1848 to 1853. From 1853 to 1864, Bunch was consul in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1864 he became Consul General in Havana.[3] From 1866 to 1878 he served as Minister Resident and Consul General in Colombia. He then took on diplomatic posts in Venezuela and Peru. Robert Bunch had been married to Charlotte Amelia Craig since 1853. [4] ==Family and Early Life== Though Bunch was a diplomat and a spy for the British, he and his sister were actually born in America. The two were even baptized in New York's Trinity Church. However, he did all of his schooling in England and attended Oxford University. His mother's side was very well-connected, and respected as a prominent family who had close ties to the Roosevelt and Van Cortlandt families. In addition to this, his mother's lineage also includes Tories who spied for the British in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. [1]His first foreign service related job was as a secretary for the British envoy in Columbia, then in Peru. In 1848, he moved to New York City and began working his way up to diplomatic positions. He married Emma Craig, his first cousin, in 1853, just before coming to Charleston. [1] ==Diplomacy in Charleston== In 1853, Bunch worked at the office of British council in Charleston, then he served as the deputy consul in New York City, and then, the Foreign Office placed him in Philadelphia. Finally after much moving around, London had him trade positions with the consul in Charleston. In Charleston, the previous diplomat, George Buckley- Mathew, created disarray and confusion regarding the treatment of Negro- British sailors.[1] As a result, Bunch's main issue during his time as a diplomat was to fix Mathew's mess. At the time, most of the black seamen were free men. The law denied them from even entering the harbor because these seamen had so much influence on local slaves. If the seamen were caught, they were to be incarcerated, and sometimes killed. The white Southern slave owners feared that their slaves would be inspired to run away to freedom. The Southerners also despised Britain's policies regarding abolishing slavery, and Bunch strongly disagreed with the people south. From Charleston, Bunch was to supply the London Slave Trade Department with meticulous and detailed letters about any American's attempting to oppose Britain's policies in the Caribbean as well as the Atlantic.To do this, he became very close with the people from South Carolina so he was able to keep track of anything from cotton trade to quarantines. However, there was much more to his job.[1] ==Secrecy in Charleston== To the eyes of the Carolinians, Bunch only took reports of various items going out or coming into the port on ships, however, the main aspect of his diplomacy was a secret. Britain had consuls in most of the states in the United States. Bunch was included in the select few that worked in slave states. The overall purpose of his job was to keep Britain informed about the matters and affairs in the United States that would only be known by an insider.[1] Bunch had to find out about confidential information regarding politics and the military. However, the most important part was every detail they could find about slavery. Though Bunch was unsuccessful in modifying the Negro Slave Act, he was an asset to the British. Since he befriended many influential Southerners, like William Henry Trescot, he was able to provide the British with information about where slaves were being traded, if and where illegal slave trade was occurring, and the number of people being traded, sold, and much more.

The Dorrs filed for their first homestead in 1910 and expanded it in 1915, and again in 1917 and 1919, with a separate 1919 filing by Mabel. The Dorr's properties were not contiguous, and the present ranch house on Woody Creek was not built until 1915. In 1919 the Dorr School was built on the ranch. The same year the community of Bill was established, named after the shared name of four of the founders. The main ranch house was built in 1926–27. The Dorrs raised cattle and horses, running up to 700 horses for sale to the U.S. and Mexican armies. From about 1929 the property was leased and sold to a series of companies associated with the Dorrs, apparently to cover financial trouble. In 1939 the Dorrs moved to Miles City, Montana and the Morton family operated the ranch as part of their extensive holdings, using the Dorr ranch house as an overseers residence.

The screenplay was written by Max Hurwitz, with the story by Arash Amel. The film is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Spain. The Titan was released for some countries by Netflix on March 30, 2018. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on April 13, 2018, by Signature Entertainment, and direct to video in Germany on May 8, 2018, by EuroVideo. ==Plot== In 2048, on an Earth overpopulated and ridden by violent conflicts, scientists are looking to Saturn's moon Titan as a new home for humanity, spearheaded by Professor Martin Collingwood. Rick Jansen, a fighter pilot, volunteers to be a part of an experiment on 14 test subjects that forces human bodies to adapt to the super-cold methane liquids and the ultra-low oxygen atmosphere of Titan. He is joined by his wife Abigail, a medical researcher, and their son Lucas, at the Titan I research area. The initial results are promising. Rick becomes able to swim at incredible speeds and stay underwater for 40 minutes. Rick's training becomes increasingly intense as he and the others adapt to increasingly Titan-like environments. Rick finds that some of his hair is falling out, and one of the team members starts convulsing and dies. Abigail notices the blood veins of all the test subjects becoming darker. Fellow volunteer Zane has a mental breakdown which causes him to attack his wife, Rayenne. Rick takes a break by sitting at the bottom of their swimming pool, where large amounts of his skin shed off. Abigail’s concern grows, and she begins experimentation on a sample of his blood, finding that it is indeed becoming darker. Rick undergoes corneal surgery to accommodate the low light on Titan. When he later has complications, Abigail confronts Collingwood about Rick's changes, but he divulges nothing. Zane suffers another mental breakdown and throws Rayenne through a window, killing her instantly. He is shot dead by military police. While visiting Rick in the medical facility, Abigail steals his key card and sneaks into Collingwood's office. She finds reports of autopsies of the numerous deceased test subjects, discovering that they were having their DNA infused with animal DNA in an attempt to create the next human species, Homo titaniens. During a meeting with NASA, Collingwood is chastised for doing forced evolutionary experimentation without proper evidence or ethical reasons, and is threatened with having his operation shut down. Abigail confronts him on the same issue, and he admits to her and Rick that he does not actually know what the surviving subjects will eventually become. Rick willingly undergoes major surgery to adapt to his new senses and become fully ready for Titan. He and Tally, the only other surviving test subject, complete their training and finish their transformations into Homo titaniens. Abigail is horrified when the significantly-transformed Rick loses the ability to talk, now communicating in a low frequency that is undetectable by normal human ears. Tally kills her husband, later visiting Rick at his home. Abigail and Lucas hide while military police surround Tally and Rick. Tally kills a member of the police before she is killed, and then Rick easily kills many more. When Abigail and Lucas confront him, Rick flees, realizing what he has become. The military hunt for Rick, but it is Abigail who finds him on a hill they often jog to. The military arrives and arrests them. Abigail wakes to find Rick in critical condition, due to his newly-evolved incompatibility with Earth's atmosphere. Abigail is forced to give him a chemical solution that acts similarly to a lobotomy, erasing all of his memories. However, she actually gives him a harmless saline solution instead, allowing him to escape. Rick begins killing soldiers as Abigail and Lucas flee with Dr. Freya Upton, an assistant to Collingwood who disagrees with his methods. The group find a heavily wounded Rick before they give him first aid. Collingwood arrives but his men disobey an order to fire upon Rick, Abigail, Lucas and Dr. Freya. The colonel soon arrests Collingwood for his treachery. Abigail and Dr. Freya become researchers at the Titan II facility, using more ethical methods than Collingwood had. Rick is shown exploring Titan, flying under his own power over a methane lake. ==Cast== * Sam Worthington as Lt.

Voltage Pictures would handle international rights sales while CAA would handle domestic sales. Producer Arash Amel spoke of his enthusiasm for the project: In October 2015, Tom Wilkinson joined the cast with Voltage Pictures planning to sell international rights to the film at the 2016 American Film Market. In December 2015, Taylor Schilling signed on to replace Wilson, who, alongside Boutella, dropped out of the film. In January 2016, Diego Boneta, Aleksander Jovanovic and Agyness Deyn joined the cast. In February 2016, at AFM, Voltage Pictures managed to sell international distribution rights in multiple countries. However, in February 2018, it was reported that Netflix had picked up worldwide distribution rights to the film. The film has also been released on Blu-ray in several European countries including the United Kingdom. Principal production was slated to commence on January 18, 2016, in Europe but was pushed back to February 1, 2016, where shooting began in Gran Canaria. ==Reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18%, based on 28 reviews, and an average rating of 3.7/10.

He was the son of the parish priest Hans Ludvigssøn Munthe (1560–1601) and Anne Catharina de Fine (1566–1601). Munthe came from a family of priests. Both of his parents died from the plague in 1601, and Ludvig was educated at his uncle's residence in Lund. In 1613 he was admitted to the University of Copenhagen, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1616 and master's degree in 1619. He became a teacher at Lund Cathedral School in 1616, but resigned shortly after to privately teach several of the sons of the nobleman Otto Lindenov. This involved two long trips abroad. He spent six years at German universities and became familiar with contemporary theological and religious orientations. In 1624 he was appointed parish priest at Nordre Borreby in Scania, and in 1634 senior court priest (hoffpredikant) at the court for King Christian IV. In 1636, Munthe was named Bishop of Bergen and he arrived in the town in March 1637. He was the first member of the Munthe family to arrive in Norway, when he took the office of his diocese. As bishop, he worked intensely to develop schooling and popular education through the liturgy and religious life. After the town fire of 1640, he rebuilt Bergen Cathedral School and expanded preaching and teaching activities. Bishop Munthe published an exposition of the catechism in 1644. Munthe's views represented the widespread Lutheran orthodoxy of his time. Some of his effort was directed against \\"pagan and papist customs\\" in the form of carnival customs and processions. He criticized popular customs, including the use of images of the saints and the pilgrimage to Røldal. ==Family and descendants== In 1624, Munthe married Ingeborg Sørensdatter Friis, daughter of the court scribe Søren Friis. They were the parents of twelve children. Munthe died at Bergen in 1649; his wife died in 1654. Munthe's daughter Elisabeth Munthe ( 1630 – c. 1649) was the wife of Christen Paus, mayor of Bergen. His daughter Birgitte Munthe (1634–1708) married Christopher Morgenstierne (1619–1679).

Between 1979 and 1983, Nigeria government jump started iron and steel production with emphasis on the importance of iron and steel in developing and driving local production of goods. A strong iron and steel industry was also projected to reduce demand of foreign currency used towards the importation of steel products. ==History== The iron and steel industry in Nigeria started by government intervention through the construction of various steel rolling mills. After iron ore deposits were discovered in old Kwara State in the 1950s, the Nigerian First Republic government began active planning and mapping of strategies for local production of iron rods and steel. However, many proposals presented by foreign companies were less enthused on steel production due to concerns about local technical know how and market demand. But in 1967, a technical group from the Soviet Union proposed the use of direct blast furnace process as a viable method of production in the country. Further exploration of iron ore deposits by Soviet firm Technopromexport yielded commercial quantities around the Itakpe region of present Kogi State. In 1971, a Nigeria steel development authority was created to design plans for iron and steel projects and train students in iron and steel making. In 1979, the Nigerian government signed an agreement with soviet group Technopromexport for the construction of a steel plant in Ajaokuta. Steel making infrastructure reached an advanced stage in 1982 with the commissioning of Aladja Steel complex, the first phase was built at a total cost of 922 million naira. The factory's process utilized electric arc furnace steel making technology. The mill was planned to produce finished billets more than it could process into wire or iron rods. The remainder of the billets were distributed to three rolling mills in Jos, Osogbo, Katsina, these mills then produced rods between 6mm and 40mm. The production capacity of the rollings mills were divided into phases, the first phase with an estimated hourly production of 80 tonnes of finished products was 210,000 tonnes per year, a second phase projected a production rate of 420,000 tonnes per year and a final phase production of 720,000 tonnes per year ===Katsina rolling mills=== Katsina rolling mills was constructed by Kobe Steel of Japan. One of the Nigerian project coordinators was Mahmud Kanti Bello who later became a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Upon completion, the country agreed to a 36 months technical assistance programme with Kobe to train Nigerian employees. The mill produced plain and ribbed rods between 6mm to 40mm in diameter and the finished products were primarily associated with wire industries. ===Jos steel rolling mill=== The rolling mill in Jos was constructed by a consortium of German firms; Mannesmann Demag, AEG Telefunken, Ofenbau Union and Bilfinger + Berger. ===Osogbo steel rolling mill=== The mill was commissioned on April 30, 1983. The construction phase was handled by a consortium of Eisenbau Essen, Schloemann Siemag, Strabag and MFB Ferrostal. The government and the builders signed a technical assistance programme to train workers who will later takeover daily operations of the mill. The steel mill complex also had housing facilities for select worker within the complex. ==References== Category:Industry in Nigeria ","title":"Steel industry in Nigeria"},{"id":"56672295","text":"Superfly is a 2018 American crime drama film and a remake of the 1972 blaxploitation film Super Fly.

Brought in by his mentor Scatter at a young age, he has been dealing drugs ever since and lives like a king with his two girlfriends, Georgia and Cynthia. One night, Juju, a member of a rival gang called Snow Patrol, hits on Cynthia at her strip club and is furious when he finds out that she is dating Priest. Against Snow Patrol leader Q's wishes, he confronts Priest and shoots at him but misses, accidentally hitting a bystander instead. The Snow Patrol members drive away while Priest gives the victim and her friends money and directs them to the best trauma center in the area. After getting home, Priest has an epiphany, never wishing to get shot at again. Priest confides in his second-in-command Eddie, explaining that he wants out of the drug-dealing scene, and that he has a plan to do so. Eddie initially resists, but eventually says that he has his back. Priest also lets Scatter know, but his mentor refuses to help him. After a hit is carried out on a gathering of Snow Patrol members, Juju suspects Priest and plans to get back at him. One of Priest's colleagues, Fat Freddie, is caught cheating on his girlfriend, who in return gives information to Snow Patrol about where Freddie was that day, allowing the gang to deduce that he was one of the assailants. Snow Patrol sets an ambush for Fat Freddie. While waiting, Fat Freddie gets pulled over by a corrupt cop named Franklin, who searches his car. His associate, Detective Mason, discovers cocaine and searches Freddie's phone, finding Eddie in his contacts. She orders Freddie to reveal where he got the cocaine while holding a gun to his head. He refuses to give up information, but his new girlfriend, Rochelle, fearing for his life, reveals his criminal history and who Priest is. Freddie and Rochelle are released, but Franklin then shoots both of them dead so no information can be leaked. Mason finds Priest and blackmails him, threatening to expose his dealing if he does not comply. Priest tells Eddie he is the reason that Freddie is dead, but he concedes that Eddie would not have given the brick to Freddie. However, Eddie becomes furious at Priest, but begins a brawl fight between them and they are falling out. After violently strangling Eddie, Priest storms off angrily, leaving him unconscious. Later, when Priest overhears Georgia and Cynthia discussing his police problems, he stops their argument and get their passports ready to leave the country. At Freddie's funeral, Scatter surprises Priest and orders him to drive to a meeting with Adalberto, his drug supplier, after finding out Priest cut a secret deal for more product. Adalberto kills Scatter, explaining how he realized he was stealing from him after Priest's profits were significantly higher than Scatter's. Adalberto threatens Priest, telling him that he can never get out of the game. Snow Patrol members led by Juju shoot up Priest's house; Cynthia returns fire before being killed by a shotgun blast. Distraught, Priest and Georgia whip up some Molotov cocktails and set fire to the mansion. Juju escapes and chases after Priest, with Q behind him. Juju is injured, while Q is killed in a car crash when Georgia shoots at him. Eddie, after seemingly having a change of heart, finds Juju and asks to join him, but Juju refuses. Eddie feigns allegiance with Snow Patrol, and tricks them into going to Priest's stash house to get revenge for Q's death, where they are ambushed and killed by Mason and other cops alerted by Priest. Juju is gunned down by Mason, who steals three packs of cocaine out of Priest's safe. Priest thanks Eddie for his help, and prepares to leave the country with Georgia. He blackmails the mayor with a sex tape, asking for a specific legal document and promising he will guarantee the mayor wins the upcoming election. Adalberto is seen being restrained and executed at his mother's order after she receives a court document proving that he framed his brother for a crime he did not commit. While waiting for Priest to pay her off, Mason is surrounded by police and arrested for cocaine possession after Priest tips them off. Priest calls Franklin to a meeting and beats him up, before breaking his arm by avenges on Freddie's murder. Having settled all of his business obligations and with his enemies either dead or in police custody, Priest is finally shown relaxing on a cruise in Montenegro with Georgia. ==Cast== * Trevor Jackson as Youngblood Priest, an Atlanta drug lord, who sees an opportunity to leave the game before he gets killed. * Jason Mitchell as Eddie, Priest's right-hand-man.

Principal photography started in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2018. Filming wrapped in March 2018, a process that Deadline Hollywood called an \\"unprecedented turnaround\\". While Sony and other publications reported the film was made on a net production budget of $16 million, Deadline stated their sources insisted the actual cost was \\"well north of $20 [million], near $30 [million]\\". The site compared the situation to Proud Mary, a film released in January 2018 that Sony reported cost $14 million to make but other sources listed at as high as $30 million. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack for the film was curated by American rapper Future, who also acted as a producer on the film. It features 13 new and previously released songs, as well as guest appearances from Miguel, Lil Wayne, Khalid, Ty Dolla Sign, Young Thug, PartyNextDoor, H.E.R., Gunna, Sleepy Brown, and Yung Bans, among others. == Release == Superfly was initially scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018. Three weeks prior, it was moved up two days to June 13, 2018, in order to avoid direct competition with Incredibles 2. The film was released on digital and iTunes on August 28, 2018 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It was released on Blu-Ray and DVD on 11 September 2018. ==Reception== ===Box office=== In the United States and Canada, Superfly was projected to gross $7–12 million from 2,200 theaters over its five-day opening weekend. The film made $1.2 million on its first day, $938,583 on its second and $1.8 million on its third. It ended up grossing $6.9 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $9 million), finishing sixth at the box office. It dropped to $3.4 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth, and after being pulled from 1,064 theaters in its third week made $1.3 million, finishing 12th. ===Critical response=== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 101 reviews, and an average rating of 5.29/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Superfly updates the blaxploitation original with a stylish remake that's exciting and visually arresting enough to offer its own slickly staged action rewards, but disappointingly short on social subtext.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 68% overall positive score. Varietys Owen Gleiberman wrote: \\"Shot in a functional, slammed-together manner that's less sensually stylish than you'd expect from a music-video auteur, the film is a competent yet glossy and hermetic street-hustle drug thriller, less a new urban myth than a lavishly concocted episode. It holds your attention yet leaves you with nothing.\\" ==See also== *List of black films of the 2010s == References == == External links == * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 crime drama films Category:2010s action films Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:American crime drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:Silver Pictures films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Atlanta Police Department Category:Films about cocaine Category:Films about the illegal drug trade Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films set in Montenegro Category:Films shot in Atlanta ","title":"Superfly (2018 film)"},{"id":"56672304","text":"Murray House is a commercial building in Hong Kong.

The larvae are similar to those of Athericidae and Tabanidae but with long crocheted false- legs (prolegs) arising from abdominal segments 2-7. The larvae have hollow mandibular hooks. The aberrant larvae had been collected in the past in the United States and considered as Athericids but entomologists had been unable to identify the adult stage until 2005 when adults were reared from larvae. The adults were found very similar to Pelecorhynchidae when identifying using the key in McAlpine's 1981 Manual of Nearctic Diptera but they stand apart due to the aedeagal tines and other male reproductive parts which indicate a clear similarity to the Athericidae and Tabanidae. The adults are dull grey with stylate antennae. The wing has cell r1 open. The name is said to be derived from Greek oreos (mountain) and leptos (thin, delicate).

It released music by several internationally successful artists such as Beny Moré, Orquesta Aragón and La Lupe. Following the end of the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization of the music industry by the Cuban government in 1961, Discuba relocated to Hialeah, Florida, as did many Cuban independent labels. Since the late 1980s the label has mostly reissued its back catalogue, now headquartered in North Bergen, New Jersey. ==History== Victor began its operations in Cuba in 1904 in collaboration with the Spanish-Cuban company Humara y Lastra, originally a pottery business. Headquartered in Havana's Muralla Street, Humara was in charge of the manufacture, distribution and A&R; of Victor's Cuban operations. For over 30 years Victor's only competition in Cuba were other major labels such as Columbia. In 1935, some of Victor's old recording equipment was purchased by the CMQ Radio Station, and in 1937 they were taken over by the new Radio Cadena Suaritos, as CMQ moved location. This marked the beginning of independent recording in Cuba, although such radio material was generally not in circulation. In the 1940s, with the emergence of Panart, the Cuban music industry began a shift that peaked in the late 1950s with the appearance of numerous independent record labels such as Puchito, Kubaney and Maype. Facing such competition, RCA Victor decided to create a new label to consolidate its Cuban operations. Thus Discuba was created, under the direction of Jesús Humara, and with Eliseo Valdés serving as A&R; manager; both had been involved with Victor for many years. The establishment of Discuba was part of larger strategy to strengthen RCA Victor's position in the Latin American market, which included multiple manufacturing deals in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, and Trinidad. On May 29, 1961, Discuba was forced to relocate to the United States following the nationalization of the Cuban record industry by Fidel Castro's government and the transfer of its assets to the Imprenta Nacional de Cuba (INC). Between 1961 and 1964, the INC was responsible for manufacturing and distributing already recorded albums by Discuba, Puchito, Panart and Gema. Discuba continued its operations stateside, although its number of yearly releases dropped over the course of the 1960s. In 1963, the newly established Real label began issuing Discuba's LPs in Colombia. ==Roster== From its inception, Discuba's roster featured several high-profile Cuban acts, such as Beny Moré, Pacho Alonso, Orquesta Aragón and Felipe Dulzaide's group. The latter served as the backing band for La Lupe's first recordings, released by Discuba under the title Con el diablo en el cuerpo. Moré came into the label already as an \\"RCA-exclusive artist\\", and continued his previous success obtaining a Golden Record for his guaracha \\"Se te cayó el tabacó\\" in 1961.Reyes Fortún (2016) p. 65. ==References== Category:RCA Records Category:Cuban record labels Category:American record labels Category:Record labels established in 1959 Category:North Bergen, New Jersey ","title":"Discuba"},{"id":"56672423","text":"Linotaeniidae is a family of soil centipedes in the order Geophilomorpha.

He attended the Brighton High School, Princeton University, and the Boston University School of Law. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and was a member of the Naval Reserve for 27 years. ==Political career== Caples was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1951 to 1959 and the Massachusetts Senate from 1959 to 1963. He then served as a legislative aide to Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody. ==Public safety Commissioner== Peabody lost his reelection bid in 1964 and spent his final days appointing aides to government positions. Peabody had until December 31 to legally make an appointment that could not be recalled by his successor, but due to Christmas break, this deadline was pushed to midnight on December 23. Men who held Caples position were usually appointed to judgeships, however there were no vacancies available. On December 22, it was announced that public safety commissioner Robert W. MacDonald had resigned and Caples would succeed him. Caples and his family arrived at the Governor's office for his swearing in, however, MacDonald showed up and announced that he never intended to resign. MacDonald's wife, however, convinced her husband to return to his law practice and at 11:35 pm on December 22, Caples was sworn in. Caples appointment was to fill the unexpired term of Frank S. Giles, who had been suspended since his indictment on charges of conspiracy, larceny, aiding and abetting in making false reports, and conflict of interest. However, Giles resigned on September 27, 1965 and Governor John A. Volpe appointed Leo L. Laughlin to succeed him. Caples claimed that he could not legally be replaced until the expiration of Giles' term on July 20, 1966 and refused to give up his office. Laughlin instead took a temporary office in the agency's headquarters while Caples pursued legal action. On September 30, 1965, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Harry T. Kalus refused to issue an injunction to prevent the Secretary of the Commonwealth from issuing Laughlin's commission and Laughlin moved into the commissioner's office. Kalus later ruled that Laughlin was \\"the legally and duly qualified Commissioner of Public Safety\\". His decision was affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. ==Later career== Caples practiced law in Boston for many years and during the 1970s also served as an assistant attorney general under Robert H. Quinn. He later retired to Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where he worked as a real estate broker. Caples died on April 28, 2002 in Lebanon, New Hampshire. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Boston University School of Law alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Massachusetts Democrats Category:Massachusetts lawyers Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:People from Boston Category:People from Wolfeboro, New Hampshire Category:United States Navy reservists Category:Military personnel from Massachusetts ","title":"Richard Caples"},{"id":"56672774","text":"Malcolm Donaldson FRCS FRCOG (27 April 1884 - 16 March 1973) was physician- accoucheur at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and director of the cancer department there.

Frances, the eldest child, studied at the Slade School of Art, taking a certificate in figure drawing in the 1894-95 session. She married Cecil Cautley Baker in 1897; a surveyor by profession, he had taken first prize honors at the Royal Agricultural College in 1877 and passed the professional examination of the Institution of Surveyors in 1885. The couple had two daughters: Lettice Cautley Baker (later Ramsey), born in Guildford, Surrey, England in 1898; and Frances Cautley Baker (later Trench; later Farrell), born in Thakeham, Sussex, England in 1902. The family moved to Rosses Point, County Sligo, where Cecil Baker leased oyster farming rights in the Sligo estuary. He died suddenly in 1903, and his widow and young family moved to Ballysadare, where Frances had a farm, worked as a photographer and continued painting. Working both in oil and watercolor, producing portraits and landscapes, Baker exhibited regularly with George William Russell (AE). In Dublin, Baker was acquainted with Irish activists and artists including Constance Gore-Booth and her second husband Casimir Dunin Markievicz. She exhibited paintings in a joint show at the Leinster Lecture Hall in 1911 with Markievicz, Russell, and Paul and Grace Henry. She also showed work in exhibitions at the Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. Frances Baker married a second time in 1915 to Dublin physician Francis Kennedy Cahill. Her husband was active in amateur theatrical circles, and they were involved with the United Arts Club in Dublin. In 1919, she opened a textile weaving workshop called the Crock of Gold in Dublin. The firm became well known as part of the craft revival of handwork and exhibited at the Irish Decorative Art Association exhibitions pre-Partition and the Arts and Crafts Society shows throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s. As with other successful handcrafting businesses at the time, the firm’s traditional handmade textiles sold to modern fashion designers, including French designer Coco Chanel. Baker's daughter Frances and her husband, the writer Michael Farrell, later managed the highly successful business. Baker's second husband Dr Francis Kennedy Cahill died suddenly in 1930 in Dublin, while Baker was in England attending the funeral of her son-in-law, the Cambridge mathematician Frank P. Ramsey. Baker lived in France for a time but settled in Cambridge by the late 1930s. She died in Cambridge in November 1944. ==Paintings== After her second marriage, Baker was known as Mrs Kennedy Cahill and Frances Cahill; she signed her work with the initials “FB” and “FC.” *Lettice, Newnham College *Loading the Turf Cart (aka Gathering the Turf) (pastel on tinted paper, 30.5 x 43 cm) *Driving Cattle (aka Bringing Home the Cows) (pastel on tinted paper, 30.5 x 43 cm) *Ox Mountain Co Sligo (watercolour and pencil, 24 x 34 cm) *Peasants Working before a Cottage (watercolour and pencil, 29 x 39.5 cm) *Self Portrait, 1900 (pencil, heightened with white; waxed crayon, 33 x 23.5 cm) *Self Portrait, 1917 (pencil, heightened with white; waxed crayon, 28.5 x 21.5 cm) *Cafe Scenes, Spalato Croatia (pencil, 20.5 x 27 cm) *A Park in Paris (watercolour, 23 x 30.5 cm) *Fontaine De L'Observatoire, Paris, 1933 (watercolour and pencil, 23 x 26 cm) *Irish Cottage Interior with Family Group, 1904 (watercolour and pencil, 18 x 26 cm) *Irish Landscape (oil on canvas, 49.5 x 60 cm) *Lettice Reading and Frances Knitting, 1914 (oil on canvas, 62.25 x 53.5 cm) *Market Day, Co Sligo (watercolour and pen heightened with white, 21.5 x 29 cm) *Market Stalls on the Left Bank, Paris (watercolour, 23 x 31.75 cm) *Meadow (watercolour, 25.5 cm x 35.5 cm) *Morning, Place Montrouge, 1933 (watercolour and pencil heightened with white, 13 x 19 cm) *Portrait of Cecil Baker (oil on canvas, 59 x 49.5 cm) *Portrait of Mrs. George Russell (oil on canvas, 76 x 61 cm) *River Scene with Trees on the Far Bank (watercolour and pencil, 20.5 x 39 cm) *Self Portrait (oil on board, 34 x 23.5 cm) *Self Portrait (oil on canvas, 75.5 x 63.5 cm) *Self Portrait, 1895 (oil on canvas, 43 x 32.5 cm) *Women Digging Potatoes, Co Sligo, 1905 (watercolour and pencil heightened with white, 32.5 x 42 cm) == References == == External links == *Portrait of Lettice Ramsey née Baker, by Frances Baker, Newnham College, University of Cambridge.

During the 1960s she appeared weekly on commercial television, performing satirical political songs. She became a household name in 1967 after refusing to pay a portion of her taxes in protest against Australia's involvement in the war in Vietnam. Although best known for her folk music and political activism, she was also an esteemed novelist and poet. == Biography == === Early life === Glen Tomasetti was born in Melbourne on 21 May 1929. === Musical career === Tomasetti began performing as a singer-songwriter and guitarist in the late 1950s. In the early 1960s she organised folk music concerts at the Emerald Hill Theatre in South Melbourne, a centre of the 1960s Melbourne folk scene. Later in the 1960s she appeared weekly on Channel Seven TV, performing a topical political song after the general news broadcast. === Anti-war activism and 1967 court case === Australia entered the war in Vietnam in 1962 in support of the USA, and in 1965 began sending conscripted servicemen to Vietnam. Tomasetti became involved in the Save Our Sons organisation, a group of women opposed to military conscription, and in December 1965 she helped to organise the \\"Songs of Peace and Love\\" protest concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, described as \\"the first major response of the folk scene\\" to Australia's military involvement in Vietnam. In 1967 Tomasetti was prosecuted after refusing to pay one sixth of her taxes on the grounds that one sixth of the federal budget was funding Australia's military presence in Vietnam. In court she argued that Australia's participation in the Vietnam War violated its international legal obligations as a member of the United Nations. Public figures such as Joan Baez had made similar protests in the USA, but Tomasetti's prosecution was \\"believed to be the first case of its kind in Australia\\", according to a contemporary news report. Tomasetti was eventually ordered to pay the unpaid taxes. === Feminist activism === Many of Tomasetti's songs dealt with feminism and the situation of Australian women. Perhaps the best known is \\"Don't be too polite, girls\\", a call for equal pay and a feminist call to arms. Sung to the tune of a classic 19th century Australian shearing ballad (\\"All among the wool, boys\\"), it was inspired by the first ruling on equal pay in Australia, a 1969 Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration ruling that granted equal pay to only 18% of Australian women. The song was still being sung by the Melbourne Trade Union Choir at the time of Tomasetti's death in 2003. === Writing === In 1967 Tomaestti organised the first poetry readings at La Mama Theatre in Carlton, Melbourne, a program that continues today. She published her first novel, Thoroughly Decent People, in 1976. It was the first book published by the notable independent Australian publishing house McPhee Gribble. The poet and literary scholar Chris Wallace- Crabbe described it as \\"one of the break-through novels in portraying ordinary suburban life without a supercilious sneer\\". She later published poems and another novel, Man of Letters. === Marriage and children === Glen Tomasetti had three children. == Published works == Thoroughly Decent People: An Australian Folktale (1976) Man of Letters: A Romance (1981) == Discography == Glen Tomasetti Sings (1961) - East - LP Folk Songs With Guitar (1963) - W & G - LP Songs For Christmas (1964) - W & G - EP Will Ye Go Lassie Go?

She announced her resignation on 4 May 2020 but remained as General Secretary until her successor David Evans was appointed by the National Executive Committee on 26 May 2020. She was previously political director and south-east England regional secretary for Unite the Union. ==Early life== Born Jennifer Sandle in London, her father served in the Royal Navy in Korea, Suez and Lebanon. She grew up with an older brother and sister in Malta, Bath and Salisbury. She went to Bath High School for Girls then St Helen and St Katharine boarding school in Abingdon, paid for by the Royal Navy from the age of 14. Formby left school with 10 O levels and 3 A levels, but chose not to go to university. ==Trade unionism== Formby became a trade unionist when she began her working life in Salisbury at the bookmakers William Hill in the late 1970s, and became a branch secretary in Unite's predecessor, the Transport and General Workers' Union. She later worked for BOC in Southampton, where she became a union shop steward. Formby became a Transport and General Workers' Union regional officer in 1988. She represented a Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust nurse in a ground-breaking employment tribunal case in 2004, where the black nurse suffered racial discrimination by being banned from caring for a white baby. Formby became the union's national officer for the food, drink and tobacco sector in 2004. In 2013, she was appointed Unite's political director. In March 2016, Formby moved to the post of regional secretary in south-east England. ==Labour Party== Since late 2011, Formby has been a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party. In February 2018, Formby announced she was a candidate to become General Secretary of the Labour Party, shortly after the incumbent, Iain McNicol, resigned. Her main rival, Jon Lansman, the chair of Momentum, dropped out of contention on 11 March, making Formby the frontrunner. On 20 March 2018, she was appointed to the role, effective from April 2018. She resigned on 4 May 2020, following the election of Keir Starmer as new Labour leader, saying \\"now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down\\".

Indigenous peoples practised varying types of agriculture, from the oases of the Atacama Desert to as far south as the Guaitecas Archipelago (43° S). Potato was the stapple food in the populous Mapuche lands.Bengoa 2003, pp. 199–200. Llama and chilihueque herding was practised by various indigenous groups.Villalobos et al. 1974, p. 50.Bengoa 2003, pp. 208–209. The arrival of the Spanish disrupted in many places local agriculture as indigenous populations shrunk and mining rose to prominence. Mapuches in south-central Chile adopted sheep, wheat and the horse from the Spanish. Further south in Chiloé apple trees and pigs proved successful introductions into local potato- based agriculture. As the Spanish were repulsed from much of southern Chile Central Chile became increasely populated and expoited with husbandry becoming the most prominent agricultural activity in Spanish-ruled areas in the 17th century. In parallel to husbandry vineyards did also became more important. Spanish agriculture, centered on the hacienda, absorbed most of the scattered and declining indigenous populations of Central Chile. Much land in Central Chile was cleared with fire during this period. On the contrary open fields in southern Chile were overgrown as indigenous populations declined due to diseases introduced by the Spanish and warfare.Otero 2006, p. 25. The 18th century saw the rise of wheat and wine for export to Peru. Villalobos, Sergio; Retamal Ávila, Julio and Serrano, Sol. 2000. Historia del pueblo Chileno. Vol 4. p. 154. Albeit many agricultural lands were devastated by the independence wars and outlaw banditry Chilean agriculture recovered fast and new lands were opened up for agriculture.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 406–413. This development, along with other factors, led to a conflict with free Mapuches in Araucanía. With the whole of Araucanía conquered in 1883 the region became the following decades known as the \\"granary of Chile\\". Dispossessed Mapuches were marginalized to small plots or mountainous terrain where their husbandry operations caused severe soil erosion. Chilean and foregin settlers intensive monoculture of wheat and logging did also contribute to severe erosion. In the far south a sheep farming boom developed at the turn of the century as the Patagonian grasslands became settled. Huaso in a Chilean wheat field, 1940. The picture illustrates two of Chile's historically most important agriculture products; cattle farming and wheat. Despite the development of irrigation canals, Economía chilena durante el siglo XIX. Cristián Sepúlveda Irribarra. limited introduction of wage labour and apiculture much of Chilean agriculture remained backward in relation to other economic sectors. Inquilinaje, an institution reminiscent of feudalism remained into the 1960s.Rytkönen, P. Fruits of Capitalism: Modernization of Chilean Agriculture, 1950-2000. Lund Studies in Economic History, 31, p. 43. As part of a policy of industrialization Chilean state invested in the late 1950s and early 1960s into dairy plants, refrigerated slaughterhouses, sugar refineries and transport infrastructure. The subsequent Chilean land reform brought profound changes to agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. Large holdings (fundos) were partitioned and land distributed to campesinos and cooperatives. Farmers syndicates were legalized and promoted. As the military dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet initiated a partial counter-reform in 1973 agriculture became increasingly run by large private enterprises and individuals who concentrated land ownership. Despite a setback during the Crisis of 1982 Chiles agriculture sector expanded in the 1980s, in particular fruit export. ==Pre-Hispanic agriculture== At the time of the arrival of the first Spaniards to Chile the largest indigenous population concentration was in the area spanning from Itata River to Chiloé Archipelago.Otero 2006, p. 36. In this area indigenous groups practised glade agriculture among the forests.Otero 2006, pp. 21–22. The forests provided firewood, fibre and allowed the production of planks. Agriculture type varied; while some Mapuches and Huilliches practised a slash- and-burn type of agriculture some more labour-intensive agriculture is known to have been developed by Mapuches around Budi Lake (raised fields) and the Lumaco and Purén valleys (canalized fields).Dillehay, Tom D.; Pino Quivira, Mario; Bonzani, Renée; Silva, Claudia; Wallner, Johannes; Le Quesne, Carlos (2007) Cultivated wetlands and emerging complexity in south-central Chile and long distance effects of climate change. Antiquity 81 (2007): 949–960 Pre- Hispanic agriculture extended as far south as the Guaitecas Archipelago (44° S), were indigenous Chonos cultivated Chiloé potatoes. Tools are known to have been relatively simple. In addition the Mapuche and Huilliche economy was complemented with chilihueque raising, fishing, collection of shellfish and algae. ==Colonial agriculture== As the Spanish settled in Chile in the 16th century many cities were founded and indean labour partitioned among Spanish conquistadores.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 109–113. Beyond subsistence the 16th century economy of Chile was oriented towards large-scale production. Spanish colonizers used large amounts of indigenous labour following the slave labour system used in the sugar cane plantations of the Mediterranean islands and Macaronesia. This system of labour successively killed the production base leading to the imposition of the encomienda system by the Spanish Crown in order to prevent excesses. In Chile Spanish settlers managed to continue to exploit indigenous labour under slave like conditions despite the implementation of the encomienda. Rich Spanish settlers had over time to face opposition to their mode of production by Jesuits, Spanish officials and indigenous Mapuches.Salazar 1985, pp. 23–25. All mainland Spanish settlements (red dots) south of Biobío River were destroyed by 1604. The initial Spanish settlers of Chiloé Archipelago (conquered in 1567) attempted to base their economy on gold extraction and a \\"hispanic-mediterranean\\" agricultural model. This activity ended in a general failure given the unsuitable conditions of the archipelago.Torrejón, Fernando; Cisternas, Marco; Alvial, Ingrid and Torres, Laura. 2011. Consecuencias de la tala maderera colonial en los bosques de alece de Chiloé, sur de Chile (Siglos XVI-XIX)*. Magallania. Vol. 39(2):75–95. Spaniards however reoriented their activities into logging Fitzroya. The collapse of the Spanish cities in the south following the battle of Curalaba (1598) meant for the Spaniards the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest indigenous labour sources.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 15. After those dramatic years the colony of Chile became concentrated in the central valley which became increasingly populated, explored and economically exploited. Following a tendency common in the whole Spanish America haciendas were formed as the economy moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 160–165. 1744 engraving published in Relación histórica del viaje a la América meridional. The image shows cattle in the Chilean countryside including a square for cattle slaughter. In the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile's husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role, contrasting to ore-rich districts like Potosí and the wealthy city of Lima. Husbandry products made up the bulk of Chilean exports to the rest of the viceroyalty. These products included suet, charqui and leather. This trade made Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna label the 17th century the century of suet (Spanish: Siglo del sebo). Other products exported included dry fruits, mules, wines and minor amounts of copper. Trade with Peru was controlled by merchants from Lima that enjoyed protection by the Spanish authorities in Lima. In addition to the exports to coastal Peru Chile also exported products inland to Upper Peru through the port of Arica. Trade inside Chile was small since cities were tiny and self-sufficient. In the 1650–1800 period the Chilean lower classes grew considerably in size.Salazar 1985, p. 49. To deal with the poor and landless population a policy of founding citiesThese cities were often in fact more of villages or towns due to their size. and granting lands in their surroundings was implemented. From 1730 to 1820 a large number of farmers settled in the outskirts of old cities or formed new cities.Salazar 1985, p. 58. Settling as a farmer in the outskirts of old cities (La Serena, Valparaíso, Santiago and Concepción) was overall more popular than joining a new city since it secured a larger consumer market for agricultural products.Salazar 1985, p. 52. Chilean haciendas (latifundia) engaged little in the supply of Chilean cities but focused on international exports for revenues.Salazar 1985, p. 88. Chile begun exporting cereals to Peru in 1687 when Peru was struck by both an earthquake and a stem rust epidemic.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 155–160. Chilean soil and climatic conditions were better for cereal production than those of Peru and Chilean wheat was cheaper and of better quality than Peruvian wheat.Collier, Simon and Sater William F. 2004. A History of Chile: 1808–2002 Cambridge University Press. p. 10. According to historians Villalobos et al. the 1687 events were only the detonant factor for exports to start. The Chilean Central Valley, La Serena and Concepción were the districts that came to be involved in cereal export to Peru. It should be pointed out that compared with the 19th century the area cultivated with wheat was very small and production modest. Initially Chilean latifundia could not meet the wheat demand due to a labour shortage, so had to incorporate temporal workers in addition to the permanent staff. Another response by the latifundia to labour shortages was to act as merchants buying wheat produced by independent farmers or from farmers that hired land. In the period 1700 to 1850 this second option was overall more lucrative.Salazar 1985, pp. 40–41 The 1687 Peru earthquake also ended a Peruvian wine-boom as the earthquake destroyed wine cellars and mud containers used for wine storage. The gradual decline of Peruvian wine even caused Peru to import some wine from Chile as it happened in 1795 when Lima imported 5.000 troves (Spanish: botijas) from Concepción in southern Chile. This particular export showed the emergence of Chile relative to Peru as a wine-making region. ==Early Republican Era== The independence wars in Chile (1810–1818) and Peru (1809–1824) had a negative impact on the Chilean economy. Trade was disrupted and armies in Chile pillaged the countryside. The war made commerce a high risk activity and royalist Peru, then the only market for Chilean agricultural products, was closed to commerce with independent Chile. The Guerra a muerte phase was particularly destructive for the Biobío area and ended only to see a period of outlaw banditry (e.g. Pincheira brothers) occur until the late 1820s.Bengoa 2000, p. 156. Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez in a meeting with the main Mapuche loncos of Araucania in 1869. With the Occupation of the Araucanía, that culminated in the 1880s, new lands were made available for non-indigenous agriculture. The Chilean silver rush that developed from 1830s onward led a significant impact in agriculture as rich miners invested in the agriculture sector.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 469–472. German immigrants that arrived from 1850 to 1875 pioneered the use of wage labour in agriculture. In the 19th century, access to the Californian and Australian markets made wheat export a very lucrative activity. La Hacienda (1830–1930). Memoria Chilena. In the mid 19th century, these countries experienced large gold rushes which created a large demand for wheat. Chile was at the time the \\"only wheat producer of some importance in the Pacific\\".Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 481–485. At the same time as the wheat cycle new irrigation canals were built and apiculture and some machines introduced into Chilean agriculture. Apart from that, new markets were explored for Chilean agricultural products. The wheat boom did not last for long; by 1855 California managed to supply itself with wheat and from 1858 onwards it went over to export wheat to Chile. The Australian gold rush of 1851 had the effect of decreasing the labour used in agriculture forcing the colony to import wheat from Chile sustaining Chilean wheat exports whilst the Californian market vanished. After the gold rushes of California and Australia were over these regions begun exporting wheat competing with Chilean wheat forcing from the mid-1860s onwards wheat exports to be shifted to England. Between 1850 and 1875 the area cultivated with wheat and barley for export in Chile rose from 120 to 450 ha.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 102. The \\"cycle\\" came to an end in the late 1870s due to the increased technification of agriculture in the United States and Argentina plus the competition of Russia and Canada.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 25–29. The end of the wheat cycle added to the already difficult situation that Chilean economy was passing through in the 1870s. Until the mid-19th century more than 80% of Chilean population remained rural working in agriculture or mining and was to a large degree self-sufficient to produce articles of consume.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 133–134. Starting in 1873, Chile's economy deteriorated.Palma, Gabriel. Trying to 'Tax and Spend' Oneself out of the 'Dutch Disease': The Chilean Economy from the War of the Pacific to the Great Depression. p. 217–240 In agriculture this was seen as Chilean wheat exports were outcompeted by production in Canada, Russia, and Argentina.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 6003–605. As the victor and possessor of a new coastal territory following the War of the Pacific, Chile benefited by gaining a lucrative territory with significant mineral income. The national treasury grew by 900 percent between 1879 and 1902, due to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands.Crow, The Epic of Latin America, p. 180 British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly,Foster, John B. & Clark, Brett.

Also available in print from Merlin Press. but from 1901 to 1921 Chilean ownership increased from 15% to 51%.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 124–125. The growth of Chilean economy sustained in its saltpetre monopoly meant, compared to the previous growth cycle (1832–1873), that the economy became less diversified and overly dependent on a single natural resource. The establishment of the Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with carts that connected these two regions of Argentina and facilitated cattle exports from the pampas to Chile, albeit in the last portion of the route the cattle had to walk over the high mountain passes of the Andes.Benjamin S. 1997. Meat and Strength: The Moral Economy of a Chilean Food Riot. Cultural Anthropology, 12, pp. 234–268. These imports resulted in a lowering of meat prices in Chile. Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura (National Agriculture Society), a landowners organization, pushed for a tariff on Argentine cattle and in 1897 the tariff was passed in a bill at the Chilean congress. The unpopular tariff resulted a massive protest in that degenerated into a destructive riot in Santiago in October 1905. Chilean wine exports to Argentina were hampered by the lack of effective land transport and a series of war scares. This situation changed after the Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and the inauguration of the Transandine Railway in 1909, making war unlikely and trade across the Andes easy. Governments agreed to sign a free trade agreement. Argentine winegrowers association, Centro Vitivinícola Nacional, dominated by European immigrants protested vigorously against the free trade agreement since Chilean wines were considered a threat to the local industry. The complaints of Argentine wine growers in conjunction with that of Chilean cattle farmers represented in Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura ended up tearing down the plans for a free trade agreement. Tierra del Fuego and much of Magallanes Region did also experienced a fast growth of the sheepherding industry since the 1880s accompanied by colonization of the sparsely populated Patagonian grasslands. In the South-Central Araucanía the Chilean invasion of native Mapuche territory caused the economy of Araucanía to change from being based on sheep and cattle herding to one based on agriculture and wood extraction. The Mapuches' loss of land following the occupation caused severe erosion since Mapuches continued to practice large- scale livestock herding in limited areas.Bengoa 2000, pp. 262–263. ==19th century== The 1900–1930 period was the one of largest growth of agriculture in the 20th century until the 1980s.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 106–107. Despite of this conditions in for rural workers remained harsh with Tancredo Pinochet denouncing the poor conditions of workers in the hacienda of president Juan Luis Sanfuentes during his presidency (1915–1920). Within a dual sector economic model the Chilean hacienda has been characterized as a prime example of a primitive and rural component. McBride, a British who visited Chile in the 1930s, is reported to have been \\"astounded\\" to see haciendas with \\"agricultural methods that reminds of ancient Egypt, Greece or Palestine.\\" Starting in 1953 the growth rate of Chilean economy decreased to an annual average of 0.7% but increased to an annual average of 2.4–3.0% in the 1957–1960 period.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 143–144. The decline in the economic growth from 1953 was attributed by some to a neglect of agriculture.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 145. The agrarian production in Chile contracted from 1950 onwards. A government plan set up in 1954 to address this ended with meager results and in 1958 a new plan was presented. That plan allowed CORFO to develop investments in dairy plants, refrigerated slaughterhouses, sugar refineries and transport infrastructure. == See also == * Aquaculture in Chile * Chilean wine * Climate of Chile * Drought in Chile * Fishing in Chile * Forestry in Chile * White Earthquake * Water resources management in Chile == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == * * *Otero, Luis (2006).

Bullpen cars were used in Major League Baseball from 1950 through 1995, and returned to use in 2018. They have been used in Nippon Professional Baseball since the 1980s. ==History== The first bullpen car introduced in Major League Baseball (MLB) was \\"a little red auto\\" used by the Cleveland Indians in 1950 at the large Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The Chicago White Sox followed suit in 1951, becoming the first team to transport the pitcher from the bullpen all the way to the pitcher's mound. The White Sox discontinued the practice in 1955 after fans continued throwing garbage at the car. In 1959, the Milwaukee Braves began to use a (locally-produced) Harley-Davidson Topper with a sidecar as a bullpen car. Naoya Masuda riding in a bullpen car In 1963, the Los Angeles Angels became the first team to use a golf cart as their bullpen car. The New York Mets introduced a bullpen car based on a golf cart with an oversized team hat in 1967. The New York Yankees began using a Datsun 1200 painted with pinstripes in 1972. Rats chewed through the Datsun's cables, and the team switched to a Toyota Celica in 1982. The White Sox introduced a bullpen car built off of a Chrysler LeBaron in 1981, but it was also unpopular with pitchers, who refused to ride in it, and fans, who threw garbage at it. The Seattle Mariners began using a version designed to look like a tugboat in 1982, called the M.S. Relief. On Opening Day of the 1982 season, the Mariners' Bill Caudill hid the keys to the bullpen car, causing a delay in the start of the game. Caudill organized a boycott of the tugboat, saying that it \\"should be fined as an embarrassment to the team\\". No Mariners player ever rode in the tugboat, and it was removed from use less than a week later. A bullpen car appeared in the 1989 baseball movie Major League. Pitchers disliked the bullpen cars, leading to them being phased out. The last MLB team to use a bullpen car prior to its reintroduction in 2018 was Milwaukee, which phased out their motorcycle (which was also produced by Harley-Davidson) in 1995. The bullpen car remains in use in Japanese baseball. Most of them are convertibles so that fans can see the players inside, including many one-offs provided to the teams by the manufacturer. In the 1980s, the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball introduced a bullpen car, a one-off Datsun Bluebird (910) convertible. It was the first of a few bullpen cars provided by Nissan to their hometown team. It would be followed by a Be-1 and S-Cargo in the 90s. In 2017, the BayStars began using the Nissan Leaf, while Yasuaki Yamasaki used a Toyota MR-S to enter games. The Tokyo Yakult Swallows also use a custom Nissan, a one-off Y34 Cedric roadster.http://www.sanspo.com/baseball/news/20171230/swa17123012000001-n1.html The Hanshin Tigers currently use a modified smart FourTwo convertible.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQHa3ITffM The Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent baseball league, introduced a bullpen car in 2012.

The land felt under the jurisdiction of de Kuijlen. In 1707 Jacobus van der Heijden became owner of the land. The land stayed in the van der Heijde family until JF de Kock bought it. JF de Kock owned it up to 1736, when it was rewarded to Hilletjie Olivier. She died in 1765. On 3 January 1882 it was transferred to John Starke and then to Jacob Jacobus Hamman. In 1883 Charl Marais owned the land. He sold it to Maria Elizabeth Green (b 6 July 1856). In 1898 Hermanus Lambertus Bosman de Waal (b. 21 September 1863) bought it and he sold it to Francois Stephanus de Villiers in 1899. In the 20th century it was sold to Old Mutual and in 1969 residential development started.

It was necessary to develop the area, as the adjacent area in Bellville Eversdal grew and it was the natural extension of that area. ==Modern Stellenberg== Today it is situated next to the N1, shopping centres and schools. Stellenberg High School is situated in the area, and in the adjoining part of Bellville Eversdal there is Eversdal Primary School. One of the Montessori school called Beehive is in the suburb. ==More development== More suburbs were founded around Stellenberg namely: Stellenrigde, Stellenryk, Ridgeworth ==Street naming== *Old Mutual street is named after the last owners of the land Old Mutual. The street that divides Eversdal and Stellenberg is named Mountain View as it has a view towards Table Mountain. View from Mountain View Street over Table Mountain *The 1969 Tulbagh earthquake centred on Tulbagh in September 1969, at the time of the development of Stellenberg. As remembrance to this event a street was named Tulbagh. This street, together with Vredekloof Street in Vredekloof, Brackenfell, is known for the bird Cape robin-chat commonly known as Jan Frederik. *The bastions of the Castle of Good Hope were remembered in street names, namely Leerdam, Buren, Katzenellenbogen and Nassau. *The shipwrecking of the Nieuwe Haarlem, a Dutch ship in 1647 was remembered in the street Haarlem. The Nieuwe Haarlem was the frontrunner for Jan van Riebeeck’s trip to establish South Africa. *Culemborg, the Dutch city from which Jan van Riebeeck originated, is reflected in a street with the same name. ==Notable residents== *Rassie Erasmus rugby coach of the South Africa national rugby union team *Braam Hanekom, the moderator of the Dutch Reformed Churchhttps://kaapkerk.co.za/viering_diens_braam_hanekom/ ==Notable events== The Kyknet produced television drama series named “Sara se geheim (Sara’s secret)” was partly filmed in the suburb. They made use of a local fishery in the area to do the film shoot. ==Dutch Reformed Church== The Stellenberg Dutch Reformed Church (NG Kerk Stellenberg) was founded on 2 August 1971. The church seceded from Durbanville congregation as Durbanville became too big. It moved to the existing premises in Stellenberg on 3 May 1975. The cornerstone was revealed by Reverend JJC Visser. The church was one of the first in South Africa to have an annual Fest Market (Stellenberg Feesmark). It is held annually between end of October to middle November.

He lives in London. ==Education== Thompson was born in Auckland. He completed a BFA (2009) and MFA (2010) at the Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland, and studied at the Städelschule, Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Frankfurt am Main, in 2013-2014. ==Career== Since graduating from Elam School of Fine Art, Thompson has exhibited extensively in New Zealand and internationally. Solo exhibitions at public galleries include Luke Willis Thompson: Misadventure at the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane (2016), Autoportrait at the Chisenhale Gallery and Luke Willis Thompson at the Adam Art Gallery (2018). His work has been included in major art festivals and group exhibition, including the 2015 New Museum Triennial Surround Audience, the 8th Asia-Pacific Triennial at the Queensland Art Gallery (2016), La Biennale de Montréal 2016, and Field Guide, the inaugural exhibition at the Remai Modern. ==Awards and residencies== In 2014 Thompson was awarded the Walters Prize for his work '. In 2016-2017 Thompson held the Chisenhale Gallery Create Residency at London's Chisenhale Gallery. During this time he developed two new silent film works: Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries (2016) and Autoportrait (2017). In 2018 Thompson was nominated for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize, for Autoportrait. He was announced as the winner of the prize on 17 May 2018. In April 2018 Thompson was announced as a finalist in the Tate's Turner Prize, also for Autoportrait. He is the second New Zealander to be nominated for the award, following photographer Boyd Webb in 1988. ==Significant works== ===Untitled (2012)=== In 2012, a large-scale sculptural ready-made work by Thompson, Untitled (2012) was included in a group exhibition titled Between Memory and Trace at Te Tuhi Centre for the Arts in Pakuranga, Auckland. Shortly after, the work was shown at the Auckland Art Gallery as part of the 5th Auckland Triennial, and acquired for the gallery's permanent collection. The work consists of three roller doors once owned by Manurewa businessman Bruce Emery. On 26 January 2006 Emery saw 15 year-old Pihema Cameron and friend tagging the doors; Emery chased the two teenagers down and stabbed and killed Cameron with a fishing knife. ===inthisholeonthisislandwhereiam (2012/2014)=== Originally presented at Hopkinson Mossman in Auckland, ' has no physical manifestation. Instead, participants were collected by taxi from the gallery, taken to a suburban home (later revealed to be the artist's own family home), where they were invited to move through the house but not enter the bedrooms, and then returned to the gallery. The work was restaged for the Walters Prize exhibition. ===Sucu Mate/Born Dead (2016)=== In January-February 2016 Thompson presented a sculptural ready-made work Sucu Mate/Born Dead (2016) at Hopkinson Mossman in Auckland. The work consists of nine headstones that were given on loan to Thompson for two years from the Balawa Estate cemetery in Lautoka, Fiji. When the work was shown later that year at the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane, the gallery said: > This cemetery contains the graves of colonial migrant labourers from India, > China, and elsewhere in Asia, who were indentured to sugarcane plantations. > The cemetery is segregated along racial and social hierarchies. Colonisers’ > graves occupy the upper part of the graveyard, which is set on a hill. > Indigenous people are buried in the central section—including the artist’s > own grandmother—while migrant labourers are interred at the bottom in an > area which floods heavily. Thompson worked with the Fiji museum and the > minister of culture in Fiji, to obtain permission to excavate the remains of > damaged headstones and to repair their sites of excavation. Sucu Mate/Born > Dead brings attention to the complicated historical interrelationships > between cultures in the Pacific region, and highlights broader histories of > exploitation central to colonisation. Sucu Mate / Born Dead was also shown in the 8th Asia-Pacific Triennial at the Queensland Art Gallery in 2016. ===Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries (2016)=== Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries is a silent film shot on 16mm black and white film. Commissioned by the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane, the work was completed when Thompson was artist in residence at Chisenhale Gallery. The film shows consecutive images of two young black men in portrait view (face and upper torso), wearing white dress shirts, filmed in front of a plain block-work wall. The films use the technology and aesthetics of Andy Warhol's Screen Tests, short films made using Kodak Tri-X 16mm film stock, of visitors to Warhol's studio The Factory between 1964 and 1966. Each visitor was invited to pose for the duration of a single 100ft roll of film. Thompson's subjects however are the descendants of women who died in London as the result of police brutality. 'Brandon' is the grandson of Dorothy ‘Cherry’ Groce, who was shot by Metropolitan Police in 1985 when they raided her home looking for her son Michael Groce. The shooting, which left Dorothy Groce paralysed, led to the 1985 Brixton riot. She died of complications from her injuries in 2011. 'Graeme' is the son of Joy Gardner, a 40-year-old Jamaican mature student living as an undocumented migrant in London who died after police raided her home intending to deport her in 1983. Gardner was bound and gagged by police and died four days later of cardiac arrest. None of the officers involved in these women’s deaths were convicted. ===Autoportrait (2017)=== Autoportrait is a silent portrait of Diamond Reynolds (who filmed and live-streamed the moments after the fatal shooting of her partner Philandro Castile by police in July 2016) shot on 35mm black and white film. The work was completed when Thompson was artist in residence at Chisenhale Gallery, where the film debuted. Thompson describes the work as a 'sister-image' to Reynolds' own video, which has been viewed millions of times around the world. In an interview with Thompson for The Guardian about the work, Hettie Judah wrote: > “Diamond,” says the artist, “needed to be interpolated into cinematic > history – the history of cinema owes black life something.” Autoportrait is > intended as a counter to the cameraphone footage Reynolds broadcast on > Facebook – which was, and continues to be, widely shared. “She is > recognised,” Thompson reminds me, “for the worst day of her life.” He wanted > to provide her with an alternative. ===How Long? (2017)=== In February 2018 Thompson opened his first public gallery solo exhibition in New Zealand, at the Adam Art Gallery. The exhibition, titled Luke Willis Thompson, features three film works: Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries, Autoportrait and a new commission How Long? (2017), filmed in Fiji in December 2017. ==References== Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand people of Fijian descent Category:People from Auckland Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Elam Art School alumni Category:21st-century New Zealand artists ","title":"Luke Willis Thompson"},{"id":"56673025","text":"Can I Get Your Number may refer to: *\\"Can I Get Your Number\\", single by Full Force 1994 *\\"Can I Get Your Number\\", single by boyband No Authority 2000 *\\"Can I Get Your Number\\", song by Anne-Marie from album Speak Your Mind 2018 ","title":"Can I Get Your Number"},{"id":"56673031","text":"The list of shipwrecks in May 1832 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during May 1832. ==1 May== ==2 May== ==4 May== ==5 May== ==6 May== ==7 May== ==8 May== ==9 May== ==10 May== ==12 May== ==15 May== ==16 May== ==20 May== ===21 May=== ==27 May== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1832-05 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in May 1832"},{"id":"56673037","text":"X-ray nanochemistry is a discipline that studies how to use newly developed nanomaterials to improve the effectiveness of X-ray radiation.

She was married firstly to British consular agent Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker, then to the pre- communist Chinese statesman Wellington Koo, and was a daughter and heiress of the colonial Indonesian tycoon Oei Tiong Ham, Majoor der Chinezen. Both the parents of Oei Hui-lan hailed from the establishment: her father stemmed from one of the wealthiest families in Java, while her mother came from the 'Cabang Atas' aristocracy as a descendant of a Luitenant der Chinezen in Semarang's 18th-century Dutch bureaucracy. After an unsuccessful marriage with Caulfield- Stoker, she met Wellington Koo while in Paris in 1920. They married in Brussels the following year and first lived in Geneva in connection with the establishment of the League of Nations. In 1923, she moved with her husband to Beijing where he served as Acting Premier in the evolving republican Chinese state. During his second term (October 1926—June 1927), Wellington Koo also acted as President of the Republic of China for a brief period, making Oei Hui-lan the First Lady of China. The couple then spent time in Shanghai, Paris and London where Oei Hui-lan became a celebrated hostess. In 1941, she moved to New York where she died in 1992. Oei Hui-lan, or Madame Koo as she became known, is also remembered for writing two autobiographies and for her contributions to fashion, especially her adaptations of traditional Chinese dress. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Colonial Semarang, where Madame Wellington Koo grew up Oei Hui-lan was born on 2 December 1889 into a leading Peranakan Chinese family in Semarang, Central Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. Her father, the tycoon Majoor-titulair Oei Tiong Ham, headed Kian Gwan, a trading company founded by her grandfather Oei Tjie Sien in 1863 that became the largest conglomerate in Southeast Asia at the start of the twentieth century. Her mother, Goei Bing-nio, was her father's senior wife and – unlike the nouveau riche Oei family – came from the Cabang Atas, the traditional Chinese establishment of colonial Indonesia. Through her mother, Hui-lan was descended from the merchant-mandarin Goei Poen Kong (1765–1806), who served as estate master or Boedelmeester, then Luitenant der Chinezen in Semarang in the late eighteenth century. The Chinese officership, consisting of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen, was a civil government position in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy of Indonesia. Oei's maternal Goei family traces its roots and prominence in Semarang back to the 1770s. Goei Bing-nio's family had initially resisted Oei Tiong Ham's social and economic rise. Hui-lan, who used the name Angèle in her youth, had an elder sister, Oei Tjong-lan, aka Gwendoline, from the same mother. In addition, her father had 18 junior wives and acknowledged concubines, as well as some 42 acknowledged children, including her half-brother Oei Tjong Hauw. The two Oei sisters as daughters of Oei's senior wife lived with their father and were educated at home by a string of European tutors and governesses in Semarang, receiving a thoroughly modern upbringing by the standards of the times. This mirrored the westernization of the Cabang Atas in colonial Indonesia from the late nineteenth century onwards. In addition to her native Malay, Hui-lan acquired fluent English and French, and decent Hokkien, Mandarin and Dutch. In 1905, Hui-lan and her sister were part of a recital in Singapore, where they were studying music. It was publicized in a local newspaper, as was a recital she gave in Semarang: > \\"The three cornered novelty of a young Chinese girl singing in French to an > English audience in a Malay country next occupied the attention of the > audience. This was “Farfalla” by Ms Angela [sic] H. Oei. Her effort > captivated the audience, and but for the fact that encores were not allowed > she would most certainly have been recalled. We have attended recitals great > and strange in three capitals of Europe, but we must admit that this, the > song of Miss Angela Oei staggered us. We repeat the novelty in a nutshell: a > Chinese girl from Sumatra [sic!] singing a French classic in French to an > English audience. Surely this is a world’s record! Is the East, after all, > so far apart from the West? > \\"In March 1907 Angèle gave a vocal recital in Semarang, a soirée musicale, > in the THHK school building in a fund-raiser for the school. She was > accompanied by her sixteen-year-old niece, Lim Tshoen, from Singapore and > her twelve-year-old nephew, Arthur Lim, on piano. Angèle performed pieces by > French composers: Charles Gounod (”Siebel” in Faust) and Georges Bizet (from > the opera Carmen) in elegant, fluent French.\\". The progressive outlook and attainments of the Oei sisters received the admiration of R.A. Kartini, a Javanese aristocrat and pioneering women's rights activist. Despite their cosmopolitan background, the Oei sisters' contact with Javanese culture appears to have been restricted to interactions with servants, and being taken by their mother on courtesy visits and gamelan performances to various Javanese royal courts. ===Marriage to Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker (1909–1920)=== In 1909, in Semarang, Indonesia,The Straits Times 10 November 1909 Hui-lan (using the surname Oeitiongham) married Beauchamp Forde Gordon Caulfield-Stoker (1877–1949), an Anglo-Irishman who was the British consular agent in Semarang, and eventually represented his father- in-law's sugar interests in London.\\"A Boycotted Wife: Chinese Lady Obtains Service in England, Married to Englishman in Java\\", Malaya Tribune', 24 May 1920, page 8Chamion Caballero and Peter J.

Oei Hui-lan, then Mrs Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker, aka Countess Hoey Stoker, and her eldest son, Lionel Montgomery Caulfield-Stoker, in 1920 It had not been an easy marriage, with published reports indicating that Hui-lan's personality, pretensions, and social ambitions had driven her husband to distraction, to the point that by World War I they had become incompatible.\\"A Boycotted Wife: Chinese Lady Obtains Service in England, Married to Englishman in Java\\", Malaya Tribune, 24 May 1920, page 8 The Sketch noted that \\"Countess Hoey Stoker is one of the best-known figures in London Society. She is the daughter of...the 'Rockefeller of China'.\\" The society magazine Tatler described her as having \\"a fondness for aviation and [being] among the first ladies to indulge in civilian flying\\", while The Times noted that \\"no dance or other function was complete without [her]...a famous beauty who drove her own motor car about London…a little grey two-seater Rolls Royce that could often be seen threading rapidly through traffic.\\" Margaret Macdonald observed Hui-lan, dressed as a Chinese (\\"which in reality she is\\"), at a costume party at The Ritz, also attended by Lady Diana Manners, the Duchess of Sutherland and Margot Asquith. Hui-lan reveled in the dancing and fashion opportunities provided by London high society. She also reveled in avant-garde fashion: \\"I was allowed to wear my favorite dinner dress, an amazing creation with full Turkish trousers made of green chiffon, a gold lame bodice and a brief yellow jacket. I tucked gold and green flowers in my hair and wore a triple strand of pearls\\".Koo & Taves, 1975 It was, she later remarked, \\"the brink of the flapper era and I fitted in like a charm. I had the figure for it, tiny and small bosomed, and the vitality. If you can imagine a Chinese flapper, it was I.\\" In 1915, Stoker took a commission in the Royal Army Service Corps and endeavored to keep Hui- lan at a distance, retreating to a separate bedroom when at home and rebuffing her desire to join him in Devonport, where he was posted: \\"It is quite ridiculous for you to come down here as you could not stick it for more than two or three days. In fact, if you came I should have to apply for leave as I could not possibly stop here\\".\\"A Boycotted Wife: Chinese Lady Obtains Service in England, Married to Englishman in Java\\", Malaya Tribune, 24 May 1920, page 8 Their \\"lives and ideas were so far apart that it makes it impossible for [me to return home]\\".

K. Wellington Koo, himself a divorcé and a recent widower with two small children. Through machinations by Hui-lan's mother and sister and others—the parents of Koo's late wife, May Tang, among them—the heiress and the politician met in Paris at a dinner party in August 1920.Jonathan Clements, Wellington Koo: China They announced their engagement on 10 October, during a ball in honor of the anniversary of the Chinese Republic, and were married at the Chinese Legation in Brussels, Belgium, on 9 November.\\"Wellington Koo '09 Married\\", Columbia Alumni News, 19 November 1920, page 103 The bride wore an antique veil and an ivory gown by Callot Soeurs. Later that year, for a State Ball at Buckingham Palace, the new Madame Wellington Koo wore a dress by Charles Frederick Worth and a Cartier diamond tiara. Chinese statesman V. K. Wellington Koo in court uniform The couple began their married life in Geneva, where Koo had been involved in the formation of the League of Nations. Hui-lan followed her husband in 1923 to Beijing, where she supported him in his role as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister of the Republic of China. Her father, Majoor Oei Tiong Ham, acquired in 1923 a Ming palace compound for the Koos, in his daughter's name, that had been constructed in the 17th century for the courtesan Chen Yuanyuan, mistress of General Wu Sangui.Susanna Hoe, Chinese Footprints: Exploring Women's History in China, Hong Kong and Macau (Roundhouse Publications (Asia) Limited, 1996), page 86 In 1924, Madame Koo returned to her native Semarang for the funeral of her father, who had recently died in Singapore; she acted as mourner-in-chief, representing her absent mother as senior wife. In 1925, the Koos hosted the Chinese elder statesman Sun Yat-sen and his wife, Soong Ching- ling, for a long stay at their Beijing residence, where Sun later died. During Hui-lan's time in China, the country was undergoing a very turbulent period in its political history the so-called warlord era, in which different military and political factions sought supremacy in the new, republican Chinese state. Wellington Koo served twice as Acting Premier, first in 1924, then again from 1 October 1926 until 16 June 1927. During his second term, Koo also acted as President of the Republic of China, which made Hui-lan – for a very brief period – First Lady of China. With Koo out of office in 1927, the couple settled down in Shanghai, then the fourth-largest port city in the world. Hui- lan's social circle in Shanghai included the businessman Sir Victor Sassoon and Wallis Warfield Simpson, later Duchess of Windsor. Hui-lan recalls in her memoirs that Wallis's only phrase in Mandarin was \\"boy, pass me the champagne\\". Hui-lan, however, found Shanghai in the 1920s wanting, and thought it \\"filled with...British shipping people...nobodies at home...[who] put on upper-class airs in China...they were so insular, so middle-class...and looked down their noses at everything really beautiful and indigenous to...[Chinese] culture: jade, porcelain, antiques. And the poor foolish Shanghai Chinese were so impressed with these upstarts that they copied their manners and filled their houses with 'Western' furniture (the so-called smart Shanghai furniture all came from Grand Rapids and was heavy and ugly).\\"Koo & Taves, 1975. In contrast, she was enamoured of pre-communist Beijing, whose classical order and ancient beauty she thought was comparable only to Paris. In later life, she exclaimed: \\"Peking is my city, where I once belonged and where I hope someday, if things ever change in my lifetime, to return.\\" ===Ambassadress and World War II=== The Koos subsequently relocated to Paris in 1932, where Wellington Koo had been appointed Chinese Ambassador to France, a post he kept until 1940. Following the fall of France to Germany during the Second World War, Koo served as Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom in London until 1946. Koo represented the Republic of China in 1945 as one of the founding members of the United Nations. All through this time, Madame Wellington Koo was a celebrated society hostess in Paris and London. The great inheritance from Hui-lan's father ensured that the couple could afford to entertain the beau monde of Paris and London on a scale that was beyond the means of most diplomats. In the summer of 1939, she attended Elsie de Wolfe's party for the Maharani of Kapurthala at Villa Trianon in Versailles with a guest list that included Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli; some considered it Europe's last swan song before the Second World War. She also oversaw the education of her two sons by Koo, Yu-chang Wellington Koo Jr. (1922–1975) and Fu-chang Freeman Koo (1923–1977), who attended MacJannet School in Paris, where they were contemporaries of Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, later husband of Queen Elizabeth II. Her eldest son, Lionel Caulfield-Stoker, lived in England with his father and stepmother, Nora. ===Later life=== In 1941, Oei moved to New York City, where her sons Wellington Koo Jr. and Freeman Koo were educated at their father's alma mater, Columbia University. Her aim was to use her international connections to persuade the United States to join the war on the Allied side to help China's war effort in Asia. Although the Koos were later reunited in New York, the war years and separation had taken their toll; and the couple divorced in 1958. She spent the remainder of her life in New York City. She authored two autobiographies in collaboration, first in 1943 with the society columnist for The Washington Post Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer, then in 1975 with the journalist Isabella Taves. In the 1980s, she was involved in a series of unsuccessful business ventures in her native Indonesia, including in shipping, tobacco and bicycles. By the time she died in 1992, she had survived her former husband and both their sons. The business empire her grandfather and father built had been broken up by Sukarno following the Indonesian Revolution; and the Republic of China which she and her husband served for many decades had lost the Chinese mainland to the Communist Party. ==Style, art and legacy== Madame Koo was much admired for her adaptations of traditional Chinese dress, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces. She is widely acknowledged for reinventing the Chinese cheongsam in a way that accentuates and flatters the female figure. Cheongsam dresses at the time were decorously slit a few inches up the sides, but Hui-lan slashed hers to the knee – in the heady 1920s – \\"with lace pantelettes just visible to the ankle\\". She thereby helped modernize, glamorize and popularize what soon became the Chinese female national dress. Unlike other Asian socialites, Madame Wellington Koo insisted on using local silks and materials, which she thought were of superior quality. She was featured several times by Vogue Magazine on its list of best-dressed women in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Vogue saluted Madame Koo in 1942 as \\"a Chinese citizen of the world, an international beauty\\", for her enlightened approach to promoting goodwill between East and West. An astute and avant-garde art connoisseur, Madame Wellington Koo sat for portraits by Federico Beltrán Masses, Edmund Dulac, Leon Underwood Olive Snell, Olive Pell, and Charles Tharp, and had her photographs taken by the fashion and society photographers Henry Walter Barnett, E. O. Hoppé, Horst P. Horst, Bassano, and George Hoyningen-Huene. Her portraits, photographs and dresses are today part of the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Peranakan Museum in Singapore. ==In contemporary culture== Madame Koo's fashion legacy continues to attract attention internationally. She was featured as a \\"woman of style\\" at China: Through the Looking Glass, an art exhibition curated by Andrew Bolton and Harold Koda, and held to great acclaim in 2015 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2018, the Indonesian designer Toton Januar created a video campaign for his Fall Winter collection, based on a reimagining of one of Madame Koo's portraits. In her native Indonesia, Madame Koo has been the subject of a string of recent publications. Under the pen name Agnes Davonar, popular writers Agnes Li and Teddy Li authored a sentimental and sensationalist biography of Madame Koo, Kisah tragis Oei Hui Lan, putri orang terkaya di Indonesia (The Tragic Story of Oei Hui Lan, Daughter of Indonesia's Richest Man), published in 2009 by AD Publisher. Oei Hui Lan: anak orang terkaya dari Semarang (Oei Hui lan: Daughter of Semarang's Richest Man), another popular biography, was published by Eidelweis Mahameru in 2011. That same year, Mahameru published a popular biography of Madame Koo's father, Oei Tiong Ham: Raja Gula, Orang Terkaya dari Semarang (Oei Tiong Ham: Sugar King, Semarang's Richest Man). ==Ancestry== ==List of works== *Hui-lan Koo (Madame Wellington Koo): An Autobiography as Told to Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer New York: Dial Press (1943) *No Feast Lasts Forever New York: Times Books (1975) ==See also== * Cabang Atas: her social class in colonial Indonesia * History of the Republic of China * Politics of the Republic of China * First Lady of the Republic of China ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Cabang Atas Category:Women in China Category:Women centenarians Category:Chinese Civil War refugees Category:First Ladies of the Republic of China Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:People of the Dutch East Indies Category:People from Semarang Category:Family of Majoor Oei Tiong Ham Category:Indonesian centenarians Category:Indonesian women writers ","title":"Oei Hui-lan"},{"id":"56673134","text":"Park Joo-sun (Korean: 박주선, born 23 July 1949) is a South Korean politician in Bareunmirae Party who was the president of the party along with Yoo Seong-min, and the Second Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. == Biography == Born at Boseong County, South Jeolla Province.

W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the forth Prime Minister of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), was assassinated by the Buddhist priest Talduwe Somarama Thero on September 25, 1959, while meeting the public at his private residence, Tintagel at Rosmead Place in Colombo. Shot in the chest, abdomen and hand, Bandaranaike died the following day at Merchant's Ward of the Colombo General Hospital.The incident that rocked Ceylon 55 Years Ago The Assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike He was the first Sri Lankan national leader to be assassinated, which led to his widow Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike becoming the world's first female Prime Minister. ==Assassination== ===Background=== Bandaranaike became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections in a landslide, at the head of a four-party coalition with a no- contest pact with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka known as the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) (the Peoples' United Front) which gains two-thirds majority in parliament on a wave of strong nationalist sentiment. After becoming prime minister, Bandaranaike was officially moved to the Prime minister’s official residence Temple Trees, however he also divided his time between his country seat at Horagolla and his town house, Tintagel at Rosmead Place in Colombo. On the morning of September 25, 1959 he was at Tintagel and receiving the public to hear their requests and complaints. The Prime Minister had been assigned a Police Sub Inspector (SI) for his personal protection. However Bandaranaike had sent him back on the grounds he should attend to more important duties and requested the Inspector General of Police to assign a few police constables instead. On the morning of September 25 only one armed police constable was on duty at the gates of Tintagel, while the sergeant in charge was not on duty. ===The assassination=== ====Shooting at Rosmead Place==== A .45 Webley Mark VI type revolver, similar to the one used by Somarama Thero Bandaranaike was seated on the front verandah meeting the public who had come to see him. There were about 20 persons inside the verandah and another 40 queued outside. Around 9 AM a Buddhist priest Talduwe Somarama Thero who had been waiting to see the prime minister took a seat in a chair in the verandah and kept a file on a short stool next to his chair. He was a lecturer at the Government College of Ayurveda and had stated that he wanted to meet the prime minister on requirements for the Ayurveda college. As each person was announced and approached the prime minister on the matters related to them, Somarama Thero was announced and he stood up from the chair and approached the prime minister who in turn also stood up and came forward showing respect to the priest in the customary form. The prime minister asked what he can do for Somarama Thero who was tensed, told the prime minister that certain improvements were needed at the Ayurveda College. The prime minister responded that he would get Health Minister A. P. Jayasuriya to attend to it if he were to submit the requirement in writing. Around 9.45 AM Somarama Thero sat down again fumbled with the file on the stool he had left as if to pull out a memorandum and as the prime minister got ready to receive it, Somarama Thero instead pulled out a .45 Webley Mark VI revolver concealed in his robes and fired twice at point blank range hitting Bandaranaike in the chest and abdomen. Bandaranaike made a loud sound and fell down, but got up and with difficulty tried to stagger back inside the house. Another priest Ananda Thero from Polonnaruwa who had been sitting in a chair close by witnessing the incident got up excited, Somarama Thero stood up and pointed his gun at Ananda Thero. Ananda Thero shouted and Somarama Thero turned around and followed Bandaranaike, shooting at him wildly. He fired four shots emptying the chambers of the revolver. One bullet hit Bandaranaike's hand and another a school teacher who had come to see the prime minister. The two other shots had hit a glass pane on a door and a flower pot breaking it. Confusion and commotion had broken out and the police constable on duty at the gate came running in having been alerted by the sound of gun shots and Ananda Thero who had come out shouting at the prime minister was shot. The police constable fired at Somarama Thero wounding him in the groin who was quickly surrounded and overpowered. Bandaranaike ordered restrain and mercy towards Somarama Thero who was arrested and taken to the Harbour Police Station under armed guard while the prime minister was rushed to the Colombo General Hospital. ====Aftermath==== Parliament was in session when news of the assassination attempt reached, Education Minister Wijeyananda Dahanayake requested that parliament to be adjourned but most of the members disagreed. However, many soon left to inquire on the prime minister. The Governor General, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke was at Queens House accepting letters of credence of the Italian Ambassador Count Paolo di Michelis di Sloughhello. When he was informed about the assassination attempt he stopped the ceremony and rushed to Rosmead Place. He informed parliament to continue and at 11 AM declared a state of emergency, bringing the military to full readiness and mobilizing reserves. ====Death of Bandaranaike==== Bandaranaike underwent a five-hour surgery by Dr. M. V. P. Peries, Dr. P. R. Anthonis , Dr. L. O. Silva and Dr. Noel Bartholomeusz and was transferred to the Merchants Ward. He regained consciousness and requested clemency towards his assassin and dictated a message to the nation. However, his situation deteriorated over night and he died twenty-two hours after he was shot. Death was recorded by Colombo Coroner J. N. C. Tiruchelvam, JP, UM at the inquest, stating that the death was \\"due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from multiple injuries to the thoracic and abdominal organs\\". Bandaranaike had been scheduled to go to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in late September 1959. The Leader of the House C. P. de Silva was in London undergoing treatment having fallen ill after consuming a glass of milk at a cabinet meeting, therefore Bandaranaike had sent a letter to the Governor General recommending that he appoint Wijeyananda Dahanayake, Minister of Education as acting Prime Minister during his absence. With this letter present, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke appointed Dahanayake as Prime Minister on September 26, 1959 and was later confirmed by Parliament.The legend that was Daha ==Funeral== Bandaranaike Samadhi (where S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was entombed) at Horagolla, Sri Lanka Following the inquiry proceedings Bandaranaike's body was taken to the Parliament building at Galle Face, to lay in state for two days, where thousands came day and night to show respect. On the third day, the remains were moved to Horagolla, where his funeral took place amid a sea of mourners. Like his father Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike interned in a specially built mausoleum known as the Horagolla Bandaranaike Samadhi.SWRD's vision lives on ==Official investigations== ===Police investigation=== With the Somarama Thero in custody the Police started an intensive investigation with a team composed of DIG (CID) D.C.T. Pate, SP Rajasooriya, ASP K. Iye, IP Abeywardena, IP A.M. Seneviratne and IP Tyrell Goonetilleke with detectives from Scotland Yard arriving to assist. ===Arrests=== Soon multiple arrests in connection with the assassination were made. Most notable of these were Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero, the chief priest of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, which put Prime Minister Dahanayake in a difficult position as he had soon after the assassination arranged for Buddharakkitha address to the nation over Radio Ceylon from Temple Trees on Bandaranaike. Following his arrest Vimala Wijewardene, then Minister of Local Government soon came under pressure to resign, she refused and was removed from office by Prime Minister Dahanayake and shortly arrested on November 21. Arrest of Buddharakkitha's associate H.P. Jayawardena, lead to rumors that J. R. Jayewardene was part of the assassination. Newton Perera, Inspector of Police - Administration Colpetty and Ossie Corea, a former excise inspector turned underworld kingpin were arrested. Corea had worked as a body guard for Finance Minister Stanley de Zoysa. F.R. de Zoysa, a businessman was arrested, and his brothers Stanley de Zoysa then Minister of Finance had to resign on 23 November and DIG Sydney de Zoysa was sent on compulsory leave. F.R. de Zoysa and Ossie Corea were later released, however the investigation found that the murder weapon belong to Ossie Corea and Newton Perera had provided weapons training to Talduwe Somarama Thero. ===Magisterial inquiry=== November 26, 1959 seven persons were charged in the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo on a charge of conspiring to murder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. They were: * Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero * Hemachandra Piyasena Jayawardene * Pallihakarage Anura de Silva * Talduwe Somarama Thero * Weerasooriya Arachchige Newton Perera * Vimala Wijewardene * Amerasinghe Arachchige Carolis Amerasinghe Fourth accused Somarama Thero also charged with commitment of murder. He had confessed to committing the murder in his statements to the police and to the chief magistrate, but later changed his plea at the Supreme Court trial. During the magisterial inquiry the seventh accused Amerasinghe, who was a Kolonnawa Urban Councilor became a crown witness and received a pardon. Sixth accused Vimala Wijewardene was cleared of all charges. This effectively ended her political career. The magisterial inquiry was conducted by N.A. de S. Wijesekara, Chief Magistrate of Colombo lasting over 124 days with 193 witnesses testifying. In the end he committed the first five accused to stand trial before Supreme Court on charges of conspiracy and murder. Although a postmortem examination of the body was not conducted, Dr P. R. Anthonis recounted the injuries and gave the cause of death. ==Cause for the assassination== The investigation claimed that the reason behind the murder of Bandaranaike, was Bandaranaike's refusal to entertain Buddharakitha Thero's requests following his support for Bandaranaike in the election. Buddharakitha supported Bandaranaike campaign with funds and influence. Following the election, Buddharakitha approached Bandaranaike to secure a lucrative shipping contract to import rice from Burma and Thailand for a company named Colombo Shipping Lines which he had co- founded with his associate H.P. Jayawardena. Bandaranaike on advice of his Ministers Philip Gunawardena and R.G. Senanayake gave the contract to the government own Ceylon Shipping Corporation. Bandaranaike further denied a lucrative sugar manufacturing licence to Buddharakitha and Jayawardena on advice of the two ministers.Rohaan recaps insights to Sri Lanka's maritime past and present ==Prosecution and punishment== ===Supreme court trial=== The Supreme Court trial of the five accused commenced on February 22, 1961 before Justice T. S. Fernando, QC, OBE. With a seven-member English speaking jury, D.W.L. Lieversz Snr. serving as foreman. 97 witnesses testified and were cross examined. The prosecution was led by the Solicitor General A. C. Alles and Deputy Solicitor General A. C. M. Ameer assisted by Senior Crown Counsels R.S. Wanasundara and R.I. Obeyesekera. The first and second accused, Buddharakitha Thero and Jayawardene were represented by Phineas Quass, QC from Britain. The third accused Anura de Silva was represented by Kenneth Shinya assisted by K. Ratnesar. The fourth accused Somarama Thero was represented by Lucian G. Weeramantry appearing free of charge. The fifth accused Newton Perera was represented by N. Satyendra assisted by A. Mahesan. ====Verdict==== The trail concluded on May 12, 1961 and the jury returned its verdict in five days. The jury acquitted Anura de Silva (unanimously) and Newton Perera (five to two). The jury found first accused Buddharakkitha Thero, second accused HP Jayewardena and fourth accused Somarama Thero guilty by a unanimous verdict and pronounced on all three of them the death sentence (death by hanging). ===Capital punishment=== S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's administration enacted the Suspension of the Capital Punishment Act No 20 of 1958, which suspended the death penalty from May 1958. Following the Bandaranaike assassination, Dahanayake government attempted to reactivate the death penalty and within a week of the assassination a gazette extraordinary proclamation dated on October 2, 1959 re-introduced the death penalty. This was followed by the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act which was quickly passed in parliament and became law on December 7, 1959. It was brought was retrospective effect, aimed at inflicting the death penalty on those responsible for the assassination at happened on September 26. However, a loophole in the law allowed Buddharakkita and Jayewardene evade the death penalty as the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act allowed for a sentence of death to a person convicted for murder committed prior to December 2, 1959 and not for the offence of conspiracy to commit murder. ===Court of Criminal Appeal=== An appeal was made by all three convicts to the then Court of Criminal Appeal which consisted of a five Judge bench with the Chief Justice Hema Basnayake, QC presiding and Justices M.C. Sansoni, H.N.G. Fernando, N. Sinnetamby and L.B. de Silva. George E. Chitty, QC of the unofficial bar was retained by the government to lead the prosecution assisted by L.B.T. Premaratne, QC and Crown Counsel Ananda Pereira. Deputy Solicitor General Ameer opposed this move and resigned in protest. E. B. Wikramanayake, QC argued that the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act did not re-introduce the death penalty for conspiracy to commit murder. The court agreed with the submission. All appeals were dismissed but amended the sentences imposed on Buddharakkitha Thero and Jayewardena from death to rigorous life imprisonment. ===Capital Punishment (Special Provisions) Bill=== By this time S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's widow Sirima Bandaranaike had formed a government and was prime minister. Angered by the decision of the Appeal Court, the government drafted a new bill. On behalf of the government C.P. de Silva who was the leader of the house on January 18, 1962 presented the Capital Punishment (Special Provisions) Bill. The bill stated specifically that with regrade to the Bandaranaike assassination, provision was made for the execution of those convicted for murder and conspiracy to murder the former prime minister. It rendered null and void the Appeal courts decision to alter death sentence to life imprisonment for those guilty of conspiracy. The bill drew loud protests and outcry, with Dr Colvin R. de Silva stating that the bill was \\"a barbarous bill amounted to murder by statute\\". The government faced with widespread opposition withdrew the bill on January 25, on the pretext that an appeal to the Privy Council was in progress. ===Appeal to the Privy Council=== All the convicted persons made an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which were refused by an order of the Privy Council in May 1962. Sir Dingle Foot QC, appeared on an honorary basis for Somarama Thero. Newton Perera, who was accused of procuring the murder weapon, a .45 Webley Mark VI revolver and ammunition, as well as providing weapons training to Somarama was acquitted of murder by the Privy Council. However, following his release from remand prison, he was served with a charge sheet by the police and was found guilty of all. He was thereafter dismissed from the police. ===Punishment of convicted=== ====Execution==== Talduwe Somarama Thero thanked his counsel Weeramanthri in open court and later converted to Christianity and was baptized in his cell by the Anglican priest Father Mathew Pieris. He was hanged in the gallows at the Welikada Prison on July 6, 1962. He was 48 years old. The hanging was undertaken by state executioner Lewis Singho and his assistant Subatheris Appu. ====Imprisonment==== On May 7, 1966 acting on the advice of the Minister of Justice of Dudley Senanayake's government, the Governor General commuted the life imprisonment sentences of Buddharakkitha Thero and Jayewardena to 20 years. Buddharakkitha Thero died in 1967 of a heart ailment aged 46 years after having served time at Welikada prison for 7 1/2 years of his sentence. Hemachandra Piyasena Jayewardena served 17 1/2 years of his sentence and was released on August 4, 1977. ====Commission of Inquiry==== Sirima Bandaranaike in 1963 appointed a commission of inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act of 1948 to inquire into the political aspects of the Bandaranaike assassination. The commission consisted of Justice T. S. Fernando, Justice Abdel Younis from Egypt and Justice G.C. Mills-Odoi from Ghana. Commission received the services of Solicitor General A. C. Alles and Crown Counsels R.S. Wanasundara and R.I. Obeyesekera. W. Dahanayake, Lionel Goonetilleke (former Assistant Superintendent of Police, CID), Ossie Corea, F.R. \\"Dickie\\" de Zoysa, Vimala Wijewardene and Sydney de Zoysa were called to appear before the commission. The commission released a report as Sessional Paper III of 1964; with adverse finding of only former Minister Vimala Wijewardene. ==Conspiracy theories== Many conspiracy theories posit that the assassination involved people or organizations in addition to those accused and convicted. One of the major conspiracies are that the murder was carried out by Ossie Corea an underworld kingpin who was imposing as Talduwe Somarama Thero. Others claim that then Minister Stanley de Zoysa was an accomplice in the murder and his brother Sydney de Zoysa, Deputy Inspector General of Police of Range II had attempted to have Talduwe Somarama Thero killed soon after the Prime Minister was shot. ==Reaction to the assassination== Bandaranaike's wife Sirimavo Bandaranaike made history by becoming the world's first woman Prime Minister. She is seen here with the then Soviet Premier, Alexei Kosygin. The assassination evoked stunned reactions nationally and worldwide. It led to a period of political instability where the caretaker government of Dahanayake lasted only one year and following an in-divisive elections in March 1960 when Dudley Senanayake formed a government for a brief period. Bandaranaike's party the Sri Lanka Freedom Party selected his widow Sirima Bandaranaike as the leader of the party. She became the world's first female Prime Minister when another coalition led by the SLFP won elections in July 1960. ==Artifacts, museums and locations today== The murder weapon, fatal bluet and the Clothing worn by Bandaranaike on that day are on display at the National Museum of Colombo. Tintagel remained the private residence of the Bandaranaike family until it was converted into a hotel in 2010. ==References== ==External links== Category:1959 in Ceylon Bandaranaike Category:Bandaranaike family Category:Murder in 1959 Category:Deaths by firearm in Sri Lanka Category:1959 in politics ","title":"Assassination of S.

There are multiple abandoned mines in the surrounding area, and it is considered part of (but south of the active area of) the Tintic Mining District. The community received its name from the quartz crystals found in the area that were originally thought to be diamonds. ==History== Diamond was first settled 1870 following the discovery of the \\"diamonds\\" in the area. Soon after a post office was established and saloons, stores, and even a school was built. Reference include several photographs of the Diamond Cemetery. The population eventually grew to about 900, but after water was struck in the nearby mines the last residents moved away in 1890 and the town was abandoned. However, the post office apparently remained open until 1906. The community's last house was moved in 1923. All that remains are the mining tailings and a cemetery. ==Diamond Cemetery== The Diamond Cemetery is a small property that is the only remaining remnant of the former town of Diamond (one of the earliest mining camps in the Tintic Mining District. Very little of the original cemetery remains, but at least one gravesite is still maintained and visited by the family of Amber Rose and possibly a new addition to the cemetery in 2014.

It is located on the road from Wenden to Kreuztal, where the road descends into the valley with a sharp bend and has 710 inhabitants. ==History== Osthelden is one of the oldest settlements in the Siegerland. There is no document about its origin. In terms of folk culture, Osthelden is a Moselle Franconian-speaking place and is situated on the Uerdinger and Benrather lines. It is unclear since when the first humans used the protected hollow on the upper reaches of the Osthelden stream as a settlement. The first written reference to Osthelden can be found in the Bickenschen Mannbuch, a feudal register of the Lords of Bicken. There it says (in today's words): Anno Domini 1344 - \\"The Lords of Bicken (Burg Hainchen/Netphen) had left the tenth rights in Osthelden and Fellinghausen to the Gobel von der Hees\\". For the year 1461, five persons subject to statutory requirements are named. Nine households are mentioned in a tax list from 1563. The first exact map \\"Markung des Dorfes Osthelden\\" was produced in 1720 by Erich Philipp Ploennies. Of the 28 buildings drawn in the register of 1834, 24 are residential buildings. The oldest surviving house in Osthelden - built in 1657 - was demolished in 2003. Until the communal reorganization in North Rhine-Westphalia on January 1, 1969, Osthelden was an independent municipality, which included today's Kreuztal borough Junkernhees.

was born into a Gorizian – Lombard family in the present day Kanal ob Soci now Slovenjia. He lost his father in infancy, and was raised by his eldest brother Pietro, in Segna, now Senj in Croatia who was a Military Auditor. == Military career on Austrian service == At the beginning of 1821 Scodnik was assigned to the cadet company with the 23 Infantry Regiment “Feldmarschall-Lieutenant Graf Ceccopieri” in Cremona, Italy, where his brother Giuseppe was also serving. A year later he was at the Cadet School of Buda in Hungary for a three-year cadet course. The lack of wars was an unfavorable condition for promotion and he was made Ensign on 1830; in 1832 he was promoted Second Lieutenant and in 1835 Lieutenant; temporary Captain in 1845, and become substantive Captain in 1847. At the beginning of 1848, he was considered for the rank, Major, after having been acting Regimental Major in few garrisons. == Military career on Italian service == Until 1844, Scodnik was not interested in politics. He, like many of his contemporaneous Officers on Austrian service, was just dedicated to his career. It appears that during his assignment in Cremona, where his mother was living, and where she also died in June 1844, he started reading about Italian history, and become involved in politics. The early 40s where peaceful years, but it was just the calm before the storm, that would erupted in 1848 in the whole Europe. Possibly the nationalism that will destroy Austria 70 years later begun in those years, and Scodnik, whose mother was probably Italian, started seeing the Austrian army as an oppressor of the Italian liberty, rather than the legitimate army of his country. He was partly from Lombard – Italian descend and had many relatives living in the Austrian Lombardy, and that might have played a part in his conversion to the Italian cause. On March 19, 1848 almost simultaneously with the popular uprisings of 1848 in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, the city of Milan also rose. Cremona was not far from Milan and the news spread out. The whole city was soon draped with Italian national flag, and many Austrian soldiers of Italian ancestry, soon fraternized with the locals. The situations quickly escalated and the Austrian commanding Officer, General Schonhals, signed an agreement with the provisional government, and three battalions composed by Italians, went under the provisional Government control, while the other Austrian would left the city undisturbed. The provisional government offered to Scodnik who was the oldest captain, the command of the three battalions and the rank of Major. He broke the indulges and accepted the proposal, thus crossing into the Italian side. On March 23, 1848 in Cremona he formed the group of “Lombard Legion”. On April 7, 1848 with a force of 3500 men he arrived in Milan. His forces were merged into the 1 Line Infantry Lombard Regiment. On June 17, 1848, Scodnik was promoted to Lieutenant colonel, and took part at the engagement of Zelo Buon Persico, where he was wounded. He earned the appraisal of his commanding Officer and former Napoleons cavalry officer, Colonel Giacomo Sessa. After the First Italian War of Independence, Scodnik entered into the Royal Piedmont Army, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retired on September 24, 1868 as a Major General. == Personal life == In June 1844, his mother died in Cremona while he was stationed there, and on October 4, 1844 he married to Maria Miller in Buda (Hungary). Their marriage produced three children, two daughters, Melania a writer, Irene who later married another prominent Italian irredentist and red skirts Officer, Matteo Renato Imbriani, and a son, Enrico. == Death == Francesco Ignazio Scodnik died on October 7, 1877. He is interred in Milan. The city of Gorizia has a street named after him. == References == == Sources == *Thompson Lancillotto, “Il Risorgimento italiano e gli Irridenti Milano”, Ravà & C., 1915; *Va pensiero. “Romanzo storico degl’irredenti” (1847–1849).

It was the second drama to star Shaista Lodhi after her first series Waada. == Plot == Khan holds great influence in making and demolishing the government. He happens to be a social worker, a caring husband, a doting father, and a caretaker of his sister. Not only this, he still remembers his ex-lover in a sincere manner but very few people are aware of Khan’s dark personality. Khan was born and brought up in a village where his parents served for a feudal family. Back in the days, he developed feelings for Sarwat, a girl in his neighborhood who had similar feelings for him. Their love seemed like an unbreakable bond but fate has something else in store. In an unfortunate circumstance, the son of the feudal lord kidnapped Sarwat, looted her of her honor and killed a person who tried to stop him. In a bid to protect his own son, the feudal lord pressurizes Khan to claim responsibility of the murder and promises for his bail. Khan appears in the police station and accepts the crime of murder, without knowing that he is also accepting rape of his love interest. When Sarwat visits Khan in the police station, she asks him of the real culprit he is saving and spits on his face. This act jolts Khan’s ego and a volcano of revenge erupts in his mind. The emerging circumstances take Khan far away from his lover and he then finds about his real enemies. A resourceful person in jail frees Khan from police custody and takes oath from Khan to work for the underworld. Khan releases from prison with a single mission— gather unparalleled power, top-secrets of government officials and cut the throats of his opponents. He emerges as a billionaire; a plutocrat and an underworld don, who is a social activist for the world but a game changer from behind. When he finds that his former lover is married to his rival, sweet memories from their past start hurting Khan even more. ==Cast== *Noman Ijaz as Khan *Aijaz Aslam as Jamil *Shaista Lodhi *Atiqa Odho *Nauman Masood as Yaqoob *Saba Hameed *Asad Malik *Yamina Peerzada *Ali Josh *Munawwar Saeed *Fatima Shah *Ali Hashmi *Usman Mazhar *Iman Zaidi ==Production== The drama was produced by Babar Javed and was one of the most expensive dramas of Pakistan's television history. ==References== Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts Category:Geo TV original programming Category:Pakistani telenovelas Category:Urdu-language television shows Category:Urdu language telenovelas Category:Zindagi (TV channel) original programming ","title":"Khan (serial)"},{"id":"56673692","text":"The FS Class E.621 was a class of five electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS). They were rebuilt in 1947 from FS Class E.620, which was originally built in 1925. The main change was conversion from 650 V DC third rail to 3,000 V DC overhead line power supply. ==Overview== The locomotives were built in 1925 by the Officine Meccaniche Reggiane, reusing electrical parts from withdrawn railcars. There were two 3-axle bogies and six traction motors, giving a maximum speed of 85 km/h. The motors were nose-suspended and geared to the axles. The rebuild was done to enable the locomotives to work under a 3,000-volt overhead line power supply and to cope with a post-war shortage of locomotives. In order to use the electrical equipment, and the 650-volt motors, without excessive modifications, the metadyne system was adopted. This halved the line voltage of 3,000 volts to 1,500 volts. The 1,500 volt supply was then fed to the motors in series pairs, giving 750 volts per motor. The power output was increased from 950 kW (continuous) to 1,350 kW (1 hour rating). ==References== ==Further reading== * Giovanni Cornolò, Locomotive elettriche FS, Parma, Ermanno Albertelli Editore, 1983, pp. 195-198. * Stefano Garzaro, Locomotive elettriche FS, editrice Elledi, 1986. * Giovanni Cornolò Claudio Pedrazzini, Locomotive elettriche FS, Parma, Ermanno Albertelli Editore, 1983. * Angelo Nascimbene, Aldo Riccardi, Ferrovie italiane anni '50 - Seconda parte, trazione elettrica, in Tutto treno tema, 1996, n. 9, p. 125 * Giovanni Cornolò, Dall'E.626 all'Eurostar. 1928-2008: ottant'anni di locomotive elettriche FS, Parma, Ermanno Albertelli, 2008, pp. 291-296, .

Typically, a tell-tail is on a port and a starboard stay. Tell-tales attached to a sail are used as a guide for trimming (adjusting) a sail. On the mainsail tell-tales may be placed on the leech (aft edge) and when trimmed properly should be streaming backwards while on a beat (upwind). When placed on the luff (forward or mast edge of the mainsail) they are used to indicate that the sail is luffing or coming head to wind. The solution is to bear away from the wind or sheet in. On the jib there may be tell-tales on both sides of the luff of the sail. As a general guide, the windward tell-tale should stream aft (backwards) with an occasional lift, the leeward front tell-tail should stream aft when on a beat to windward. If one tell-tale begins to spiral, it is indicating the sail has detached air flow on that side. To correct this the sail needs to move towards the opposite side. \\"Tiller to tattling tail\\" is a good phrase to remember which direction to push the tiller when the tail is spiraling. Alternatively, the sail itself can be sheeted in or out towards the tell-tale which is not streaming. For example, a luffing windward telltale would indicate an under-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to sheet in that sail. A luffing leeward telltale would indicate an over-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to ease the sheets for that sail. They are used both sides of the jib. A tell-tale compass or repeating compass is a special compass installed in the ceiling of a cabin, and can be read from below or above deck. According to Moby-Dick, a tell-tale refers to the cabin-compass, \\"because without going to the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.\\" == Types == There are three types of telltale: # Draft telltales are positioned either side of the sail usually around the deepest part of the sail. # Leech telltales are positioned on the leach of the sail # Shroud telltales are attached to a boat's shrouds Draft telltales tend to be made from wool. Leech and shroud telltales are usually made from ribbon. == Reading draft telltales == If the sails are under-trimmed or the vessel is are pointing too high then the telltales on the inside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the ones on the outside will stream aft. If the sails are over-trimmed or the vessel is sailing too low then the telltales on the outside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the inside ones will stream aft. ==References== Category:Sailboat components ","title":"Tell-tale (sailing)"},{"id":"56673773","text":"Udayawansha Parakrama (born 6 March 1996) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

Withell took up amateur boxing in 1937, and won the New Zealand heavyweight title that year in only his eighth competitive bout, having beaten Morrie McHugh in the semi-final. He was then selected to represent New Zealand in the heavyweight division at the 1938 British Empire Games, but his lack of experience told, and he was defeated in his opening bout when he was knocked out in the first round by South African Claude Sterley, who went on to win the silver medal. == Career == Withell won the national amateur light-heavyweight title in 1939, before enlisting to serve in the New Zealand forces during World War II. Withell had a record of 24 amateur bouts in New Zealand, for 21 wins, on draw and two losses. He served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) in Egypt, where he won the Army light-heavyweight boxing Middle East forces title, and was a member of the 2NZEF brass band at Maadi Camp, playing the euphonium. Withell returned to New Zealand in early 1944, and, after the war, took up a rehabilitation farm at Leeston, where he was active with the local brass band, as a boxing trainer and in the Returned Services' Association (RSA). After selling the farm in 1955, Withell rejoined the army, based at Burnham Camp, where he was a storeman and clerk. In 1956, he was promoted from private to lance corporal, and he retired from the army in 1960. He then lived near Weedons, training horses for harness racing, and working as a prison officer for 14 years at Paparua Prison.

Between 1949 and 1989 more than 130 government ministers were appointed in the German Democratic Republic. Only four were women (and one of those, Margot Honecker, was married to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party - the leader of the country). The first of the four, appointed in April 1953, was Elisabeth Zaisser. == Life == === Provenance and early years === Elisabeth Auguste Knipp was born in Essen. Her family were from nearby Düsseldorf. Her father is variously described as a shipping clerk, a merchant and/or a businessman. She attended a Catholic junior school between 1905 and 1908, and then a middle school for girls till 1915. From then till 1918 she attended the Lycee (\\"Oberlyzeum\\"). During 1918/19 she qualified in Essen as a teacher, and embarked in a teaching career there. She withdrew from teaching when she married Wilhelm Zaisser on 6 June 1922 and is described in one source as a \\"housewife\\" (\\"Hausfrau\\") between 1922 and 1932. Those years were not uneventful for her, however. === Family and politics === The couple's daughter, Renate, was born during the first half of 1924. Wilhelm Zaisser was an energetic Communist Party activist, and in 1926 Elisabeth joined the party. That was also the year in which the family relocated to Berlin. In 1927 Wilhelm Zaisser was recruited by the Comintern to work on their behalf in China where according to one source he was a co-organiser of the Guangzhou Uprising. Elisabeth Zaisser relocated to Mukden (as Shenyang is identified in most western sources from that time) in 1928 in order to join her husband. They left China in 1930 and returned to the west: there was a four-month stop- over in Moscow before they settled in Berlin, where she worked for the local party in the Köpenick quarter of the city between 1930 and 1932. === Soviet exile === In April 1932, accompanied by her daughter, and in response to a party instruction, she went back to Moscow. Her husband returned to the Soviet capital from a two-year assignment in Prague at about the same time. In early September she became a teacher at the Karl Liebknecht School, a German language elementary school for the children of German refugees in Moscow at which she continued to work for a year or so. At the same time she embarked on a three-year study course with the Moscow-based \\"Julian Marchlewski\\" Communist University of the National Minorities of the West which evidently combined evening classes with correspondence based study. Meanwhile, the Nazis took power back in Germany at the start of 1933 and rapidly transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship. Elisabeth Zaisser would spend Germany's twelve Nazi years living in the Soviet Union, supporting herself with a succession of teaching jobs. Between 1934 and 1946 Zaisser was responsible for German language teaching at the Moscow State Pedagogical Institute, where she was also able to pursue further studies on her own account. She undertook work as an editor for the \\"Moscow Teaching Books Publisher\\" and for the institution responsible for national university curricula. In addition, she taught German at the Institute of Red Professors (\\"Институт красной профессуры\\") between 1934 and 1937. In 1938 she took over for a year as head of the Department of German Philology at the Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages in Gorky (as Nizhny Novgorod had been renamed in 1932). She returned to Moscow in 1939, heading up the department for German language and translation courses for with the Party Central Committee. In 1940 she took Soviet citizenship. Along with her work for the Central Committee, between 1941 and 1942, and again from 1944 till 1947, she was in charge of the graduate-level courses at the Red Army's \\"Military Institute for Foreign Languages\\". In June 1941 the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany ended abruptly when the Germans launched a massive invasion, triggering what came to be known in the Soviet Union as the \\"Great Patriotic War\\". On 20 October 1941 Moscow was declared to be in a state of siege. By that time thousands of Muscovites, including many longstanding German political exiles, had been evacuated. Elisabeth Zaisser was evacuated to the south at the start of October 1941, first to Stavropol and later to Engels. The period of greatest threat to Moscow appears to have lasted till the Autumn of 1942, when Zaisser returned to the city. For five months during 1942/43 she worked as a translator for the Soviet Union's National Broadcasting Committee (\\"Государственный вещательный комитет\\"). She also authored a number of teaching books on German language and grammar. === Soviet occupation zone === War ended in May 1945, leaving the large central portion of Germany surrounding Berlin administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Sources differ as to whether it was in 1946 or 1947 that the Zaissers returned to Germany. Elisabeth lost little time in joining the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which had been created through a contentious political merger in April 1946, and was now well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. She took a position with the Workers' and Farmers' Faculty at the University of Halle where she also took on a teaching contract on Soviet Literature. === German Democratic Republic === In October 1949 Zaisser switched to the \\"TH Dresden\\" (as that institution was known at that time), appointed \\"Professor of Soviet Pedagogical Methodology for Russian Teaching\\" (\\"Professorin für Sowjetpädagogik und Methodik des Russisch- Unterrichts\\"). Her time in Dresden was brief, however, since on 1 January 1950 she was appointed director at the \\"Central Institute of German Pedagogy\\" in (East) Berlin. She also became editor of Pädagogik, a monthly journal with a focus on school education. Also in 1950 she became a Secretary of state at the Education Ministry. In July 1952 she succeeded Paul Wandel as Minister for Education. Early April 1953 it was reported that she had led a high level East German government delegation to Budapest in order to take part in the Hungarian National Day celebrations. She relinquished the ministerial post \\"at her own wish\\" in October 1953. Her ministerial resignation was justified, officially, with the explanation that she had been applying her experiences of the school system in the Soviet Union without appropriately adapting them for East German conditions. Between 1950 and 1954 Elisabeth Zaisser also sat as a member of East Germany's national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). Despite her SED party membership, she sat not as a representative of the SED but as one of 20 representatives of the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD). The DFD was not a conventional political party in western terms, but one of the mass organisations that received seats in the parliament based on fixed quotas assigned by the ruling party, which under the single-list voting system in operation officially secured, for its list of candidates, the votes of 99.72% of those voting in the 1950 general election. Under the Leninist system in place, political power was concentrated not in parliament nor in government ministries but in the leadership of the Party Central Committee, but the parliament with its visibly broadly based membership was nevertheless important in conferring political legitimacy on the overall power structure, and ministries were necessary for implementing Central Committee decisions. Elisabeth Zaisser's ministerial resignation in 1953 and her failure to reappear as a Volkskammer member after the 1954 general election had nothing to do with her own talents or shortcomings. It was part of Wilhelm Zaisser's dramatic fall from grace in the vicious power struggles that broke out in the wake of the June uprising. In December 1953 Elizabeth Zaisser was given the status of one persecuted by the Nazi régime (\\"Verfolgter des Naziregimes\\" / VdN), which qualified her for a small supplementary pension. She also worked between 1953 and 1983 in an editorial function with the Volk und Wissen Verlag publishing organisation, while supplementing her income through freelance translation work. == Awards and honours == * 1978 Patriotic Order of Merit (gold clasp) == References == Category:1898 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Politicians from Essen Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany politicians Category:Government ministers of East Germany Category:Members of the 1st Volkskammer Category:German translators Category:TU Dresden faculty Category:Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg faculty Category:People who emigrated to escape Nazism Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit (honor clasp) Category:German schoolteachers Category:20th-century translators ","title":"Elisabeth Zaisser"},{"id":"56673921","text":"Santanu Bose is an Indian-theatre director and drama teacher.

It was released on November 21, 2008 in German-speaking territories. The game was worked on by ex-LucasArts alumni Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein. ==Plot== Real life Mata Hari embarks on a fictional adventure in which she becomes a spy and uncovers sensitive military secrets, all in the midst of the outbreak of World War One. ==Gameplay== Primarily a point and click adventure game, the title also includes various minigames. For instance players have to perform exotic dances in order to earn money. The game allowed players to skip these dance-oriented sections. ==Development== The game was developed by Hanover-based studio 4Head Studio/Cranberry Production. DTP Entertainment published the game worldwide on its Anaconda label. A press release on April 26, 2007 listed a release date of Q1 2008 for Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The core idea, a spy game with Mata Hari at the turn of the last century, was created by Christopher Kellner and Marc Buro. Buro, a producer at DTP, approached both Barwood and Falstein separately and pitched them a game based on Mata Hari, which after discussing the opportunity, felt was \\"right up our alley\\". The duo agreed to collaborate on the project. Barwood and Falstein were the principle designers, and fleshed out the core idea into a full-fledged game. The 4Head Studio team was led by Tobias Severin, Matthias Meyer, and Oliver Specht. The duo, who both lived in California, were able to discuss the game at a local cafe. However, they also began to have long Skype conversations between California, Hannover and Hamburg. In August 2007, Barwood and Falstein attended a series of meetings in Hannover to review and fine-tune the design. ==Critical reception== Adventure Archiv thought that the game was short at a play time of ten hours. Adventure Treff wrote that reading the Wikipedia article of the subject of the game was more exciting than playing the game, and notes the game developers should have read it too prior to making the game. Adventure Corner felt the game's story was littered with plot holes. Game Captain felt the game came across as simple and superficial. Adventures Unlimited thought the game fell below expectations. Jeux Video described the title as one that exudes freshness, maturity and remarkable intelligence. ==References== ==External links== *Official website via Internet Archive * Category:2008 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Cultural depictions of Mata Hari Category:Single-player video games Category:Spy video games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in Berlin Category:Video games set in Monaco Category:Video games set in Paris Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:World War I video games ","title":"Mata Hari (video game)"},{"id":"56674002","text":"A tell-tale warning of a low clearance over a road A tell-tale, also known as a bridge warning, is a series of ropes suspended over railway tracks to give warning to the engineer, and more importantly the brakeman who may be scampering across the tops of the cars, that the train is approaching a low- clearance obstacle, such as a tunnel or a bridge.https://www.google.com/patents/US1467156https://www.american- rails.com/tell-tales.html In the US, a standard tell-tale design had ropes on centers for a width of over the track, the bottom of the ropes lower than the height of the obstruction, and placed at least before the obstruction.Bridge Warning, Maintenance of Way Cyclopedia, Simmons Boardman and Co., 1921; page 246.

Historically, Australia attempted to establish a whites-only state through restriction of non-white immigration and assimilation of Aborigines in its White Australia policy. Apartheid-era South Africa, attempted to do so by pushing non-white population in areas known as Bantustans, through various means including deportations and racial segregation, with the aim of establishing separate states out of the resulting ethnically cleansed areas, the largest of which would be a white state. ==Proposed white ethnostates== === North America === Historically as well as in modern times, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and a portion of Montana) has been proposed by many white supremacists as a location for the establishment of a white ethnostate. This Northwest Territorial Imperative was promoted by Richard Girnt Butler, Robert Jay Mathews, David Lane and Harold Covington, the terrorist organization The Order, the neo-Nazi Christian Identity organization Aryan Nations, the white power skinhead Volksfront, and the Northwest Front, among others. The Northwest Territorial Imperative also has loose overlap with the Cascadia independence movement which also seeks to create an independent republic between the Northwest and parts of Northern California in the United States and British Columbia in Canada. Some in the far-right use the term American Redoubt to describe a similar migration to the Northwestern United States.https://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2018/04/26/does-this-anti- sodomite-slavery-defending-holocaust-denying-idaho-pastor-lead-a-hate-group Additionally other areas have looked into as sites for a potential white ethnostate by certain groups most notably the South and the self-proclaimed \\"Southern Nationalist\\" League of the South (LS) given the region's history of secessionism and once being an independent nation known as the Confederate States of America (1861-1865). Another example is Billy Roper's Shield Wall Network (SWN), a neo-Nazi organization located in Mountain View, Arkansas seeks to build a \\"white ethnostate\\" in the Ozark region and is affiliated with other separatist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) Knights Party located near Harrison, Arkansas, League of the South (LS) and National Socialist Movement (NSM) of the now defunct Nationalist Front.https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/shield-wall-network-swn Conversely, the Ozarks have been a \\"hotbed\\" for adherents of the Christian Identity movement including the Church of Israel and various members of the Christian Patriot movement who have set up paramilitary training camps to prepare for a coming Armageddon.https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating- hate/Gayman-Dan- EIA-1.pdfhttps://www.resist.com/Instauration/OtherPubs-20120723/SilentBrotherhood.pdf The defunct neo-Nazi organization Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) led by Matthew Heimbach also sought to create a white ethnostate called \\"Avalon\\" built upon the ideological principles of Nazism, various strands of European fascism such as Legionarism and British Fascism and Eastern Orthodoxy. === South Africa === After the end of apartheid, some Afrikaner nationalist organizations, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, started to promote the idea of a Volkstaat that would be created in the Western Cape region. ==Historical attempts at creating a white ethnostate== ===South Africa=== During the apartheid era, the South African government, led by the National Party, attempted to turn South Africa into a whites-only state by forcing millions of black people to move to bantustans. Post-apartheid, some Afrikaner groups such as Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) and Afrikaner Volksfront have promoted the idea of a Volkstaat or a homeland for Afrikaners only. The town of Orania, Northern Cape is a manifestation of the Volkstaat idea. ===Australia=== For 72 years, from 1901 until 1973, Australia implemented a White Australia Policy to exclude people of non-European origin. ===United States=== In 2013, white supremacist Craig Cobb attempted to take over the small town of Leith, North Dakota, and turn it into a neo-Nazi enclave; this failed due to Cobb's violent behavior towards Leith residents, which got him arrested. The events form the basis of the documentary Welcome to Leith. The United States also had historical white nationalist ideas, in the form of the Naturalization Act of 1790 which would allow whites to apply for citizenship if they have lived in The United States for two years without breaking any laws.

The film begins with a woman inheriting her late aunt's house and moving in with her daughters. During their first night there a gang of murderers break in, and events change the family's lives forever. Sixteen years later, one of the now-adult daughters returns to the house to visit her mother and sister. Ghostland was shown in competition at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer, where it won three awards, including the Grand Prize. ==Plot== A woman named Pauline travels with her teenage daughters Beth and Vera to their recently- deceased aunt Clarissa's secluded home after they inherited it in her will. Beth reads an article about a string of home invasions where parents are murdered, but daughters are spared. Unbeknownst to the family, they are stalked by someone driving a candy truck. Shortly after the women settle into the house, a large, mentally impaired man breaks in and attacks Pauline. The man drags Beth and Vera into the basement and a strange woman enters. When Beth asks what they want, the woman replies, \\"We just wanna play with dolls.\\" The man assaults the girls and rapes Vera. Pauline recovers and fights back to save her daughters—while Beth looks on, unwilling to act—and stabs both the man and the woman. Sixteen years later, Beth is now a successful horror author living in Chicago with her husband and son. She appears on a talk show to promote her new novel Incident in a Ghostland, based on her experience that night. She receives a frantic phone call from her sister who has suffered from delusions since the trauma, begging her to return to the house where she still lives with their mother. When Beth arrives, Pauline explains that Vera remains unable to move on and continues reliving that night over and over. In the house, Beth has strange experiences and Vera claims that their tormentors are still trying to get them. Beth finds Vera chained and made up to look like a doll. When she sees Vera flailing as if attacked by a ghost, Pauline calls an ambulance and tells Beth not to listen to Vera. Beth falls asleep waiting for her mother and ends up captured by the Candy Truck Woman. When she recovers, she discovers bruises all over her beaten face. She finds Vera also beaten up in the basement and blames her for the wounds. Vera begs her sister to face the truth. Beth finally flashes back to a memory and it is revealed that the Candy Truck Woman actually killed their mother. Beth breaks from her imagined adulthood to realize that the Fat Man and Candy Truck Woman are still holding her and Vera captive as teenagers in Clarissa's home. The Candy Truck Woman takes Beth upstairs and dresses her like a doll, leaving her in a room littered with dolls. The Fat Man enters to begin molesting and torturing the dolls. When he gets to Beth, she fights back and flees. She frees her sister and the two of them escape the house. They make it to a road where two state troopers help them, reporting the incident to dispatch. However, both are gunned down by the Candy Truck Woman who recaptures the girls. Beth mentally retreats back to her adulthood fantasy. At a cocktail party, she meets her idol, H.P. Lovecraft, who tells Beth that her novel is a masterpiece. Beth sees her sister screaming for help and decides to return to rescue Vera. Back in reality, she escapes from the Fat Man and initiates a violent fight with the Candy Truck Woman. Another state trooper arrives in time to gun down both the Fat Man and the Candy Truck Woman. After authorities arrive, Beth sees a vision of her mother waving at them from the house as the sisters are taken to the hospital. She looks at her antique typewriter that she threw off the window while trying to escape and tells the paramedic she likes to write stories. ==Cast== * Crystal Reed as Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Keller ** Emilia Jones as Young Beth * Anastasia Phillips as Vera ** Taylor Hickson as Young Vera * Mylène Farmer as Pauline * Kevin Power as Candy Truck Woman * Rob Archer as Fat Man * Paul Titley as H.P.

The film was predominantly shot in Canada. ===Accident=== In December 2016, actress Taylor Hickson was facially disfigured while shooting a scene for the film. She was rushed to the hospital and received 70 stitches, but was permanently scarred. In March 2018, Hickson sued the film’s production company Incident Productions over lost work as a result of the incident. Hickson claimed in the lawsuit that \\"in the course of shooting the scene, the director Pascal Laugier, consistently told Hickson to pound harder on the glass with her fists\\". While filming another take, the lawsuit states: Hickson, in the lawsuit, states that the company failed to take \\"any and all reasonable steps to ensure that industry standards and practices were adhered to, including but not limited to the use of safety glass and/or stunt doubles as appropriate.\\" ==Release== Ghostland was first shown in competition on 3 February 2018 at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer. Ghostland won three film awards at the festival, including the Grand Prize, Audience Award, and the SyFy Award. The SyFy award was chosen by five bloggers at the festival. Frédéric Strauss of Télérama noted that this was the second French co-production in a row that dominated the awards at the festival with the previous years big winner being Raw by Julia Ducournau. The film received a theatrical release in France on 14 March 2018. In some territories, the film was released as Ghostland and in others as Incident in a Ghostland. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54%, based on 26 reviews with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Incident in a Ghost Land may satisfy horror fans in search of a nasty kick, but it's narratively flawed and decidedly not for the squeamish.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporter declared the film to be a \\"taut—if somewhat corny—slasher flick\\" and it was \\"neither for the faint of heart nor the sharp of mind\\". The review noted the dialogue, finding that \\"for [the director's] second film in English after 2012’s The Tall Man, he could have brushed up more on his dialogue, which rings awfully flat.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety declared that Ghostland \\"all seems slick, intense, and unpleasant in the same hollow way \\"Martyrs\\" did, because all the cruelty is so meaningless. Replacing that film’s empty pseudo-mysticism are villains for whom Laugier doesn’t bother providing any motivation or backstory.\\" Simon Abrams of The Village Voice wrote that the film was a \\"disturbing and effective critique of misogynist torture porn,\\" it \\"may sometimes play like a mindlessly gory slasher clone, but Laugier’s tormented girls consistently prove to be stronger than their brutalized bodies.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2018 horror films Category:Canadian films Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Pascal Laugier Category:Films shot in Canada Category:Canadian horror films Category:French horror films Category:English- language French films ","title":"Ghostland"},{"id":"56674352","text":"Hasitha Lakmal de Silva (born 25 March 1991) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

Operation Good Neighbor (, Shkhenut Tova, lit. \\"Good neighborliness\\") was a directive of the Northern Command's Division 210 of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) that was responsible for civilian aid to Syrian citizens who were affected by the Syrian Civil War. ==Background== In June 2016 the directive was established and in August its first activity took place. Since then, it carried out more than 110 types of aid operations. Coordination and control of humanitarian activities was managed by Good Neighbor, and Division 210 forces assisted in the transport of equipment and in securing the operations. About 400 families lived in tent camps near the border and the rest had lived in villages or in open fields. About a third of the residents were displaced persons or refugees, half of whom were minors. The patients brought to Israel for treatment were mostly treated in hospitals in northern Israel, mainly at the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya and the Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed. According to the IDF, aid to Syrian civilians was motivated by both conscience and security interests. The IDF did not want to stand by in the face of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, and aid could create a less hostile environment across the border. Gadi Eisenkot, Israeli Defense Forces’ Chief of Staff admitted that Israel supplied rebels at the border with light weapons. Aid was given in three ways: * Medical aid – enabling the crossing of hundreds of children through the border for one-day treatment, assistance in the establishment of two medical centers, the transfer of Medication surfaces and items of advanced medical equipment, and the establishment of a field clinic for routine medical treatment. The clinic, \\"Camp Ichay\\", was established by an American humanitarian organization, \\"Friendships\\", based in Port Merci (Lake Charles, Louisiana) specializing in victims of humanitarian disasters in the world. * Infrastructure – the transfer of fuel for heating, operation of water wells and bakeries ovens, the transfer of seven generators for the production of electricity, diesel, water pipes for the rehabilitation of infrastructure and educational equipment. * Civil Assistance – humanitarian aid for residents of Syria - food and flour for bakeries, Baby nutrition products packages, diaper packages, shoes and warm clothing. In 2017, a Maternity hospital was opened in the Syrian village of Bariqa, without any equipment. Following its outreach to Israel, incubators, anesthesia machines and ultrasound devices were sent.

The historic building has been preserved and renovated. It is now a branch in Savannah's Live Oak Public Libraries system. The library is an example of Prairie style architecture and is one of only two Carnegie library projects for African-Americans in Georgia. It was the local library for James Alan McPherson, who became the first African American writer to win a Pulitzer Prize and for Clarence Thomas who went on to become a judge on the United States Supreme Court. The building has won honors for its renovation and historical preservation. It is a contributing property of the Savannah Victorian Historic District. ==History== On November 1, 1903, the city of Savannah and the Georgia Historical Society partnered to open a public library on a three-year basis in Hodgson Hall on the north side of Forsyth Park in Savannah. The black citizens of the Savannah community were prevented from using the new library. This prohibition provided the impetus for the formation of the Colored Library Association of Savannah. (The Georgia Historical Society, 2014) The Colored Library Association of Savannah formed in 1906 and operated the Savannah Colored Public Library out of the basement of Dr. Jamison, one of Savannah's prominent black dentists of the time. Another prominent member of the association was Richard R. Wright Sr., President of Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth (Savannah State University). The Association's twelve founding members included many of black Savannah's professional, business, and cultural leaders. The Colored Library Association of Savannah relied on contributions of books from their founding members, and money from local supporters to open their own library to the public. In 1909, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Savannah $60,000 (later raised to $75,000) for a new main library on Bull Street. (The University of Southern Mississippi) This donation encouraged the Colored Library Association to approach the philanthropist themselves. Donations from the black community and the twelve founding members facilitated the purchase of land for a building on East Henry Street across from Dixon Park; which at that time, was home to a thriving black middle class. The neighborhood was home to many black teachers, doctors, lawyers and business owners. Once the land was secured, the Carnegie Foundation awarded the Colored Library Association a sum of $12,000 to build a small library. (The University of Southern Mississippi) The Colored Carnegie Library opened on August 14, 1914. Its inaugural librarian was Charles A.R. McDowell. Though its opening day collections consisted of only 3,000 volumes, the library immediately became an indispensable community institution among Savannah's African Americans. It provided them with reading materials by black and white authors, programs to attend, clubs to join, and space for public meetings. While the library received support from the city, it remained supervised by a separate board until 1963, when Savannah desegregated its libraries. The Carnegie Library reopened as an integrated branch of the Savannah Public Library but continued to serve a predominantly African American clientele. (The University of Southern Mississippi) Julian deBruyn Kops, a local Savannah architect and engineer, was commissioned to design the new library. The building itself is significant not only because of the part it plays in the social history of black Savannah, but also because of the style of which deBruyn Kops chose for it. It is one of the only examples of Prairie Style architecture within the city. In 1915 the building was officially completed and came to be known locally as the \\"Carnegie Colored Public Library\\" because it was reserved for the African-American community, who were excluded from the other public library in town. In respect and appreciation of the assistance they received from the Carnegie grant, the name of the library was also officially changed when it was moved into Kops' building on East Henry Street. The Carnegie Colored Library which existed after this move helped to foster and support a growing black community in downtown Savannah through the two world wars and struggles for civil rights. The Carnegie Library became a refuge and educational center for local black children, some of which grew up to become local representatives. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his memoirs that he frequently used it as a boy, before the library system was desegregated.Clarence Thomas, My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir, HarperCollins, 2008, pp. 17, 29, 30, Google Books During a time of social, class, and racial segregation the Carnegie colored library helped to publicize the need for education segregated areas. ==Architecture== Live Oak Public Library System celebrating centennial anniversary documents describe the building's the Prairie architecture influences noting: \\"The monumental staircase leading to the main entrance on the second floor is framed by two enormous piers with sandstone orbs on small pedestals. Additionally there are four tiered brick walls with sandstone coping which flank the staircase. The corners of the piers are delineated by dark glazed bricks, a motif repeated in a horizontal band over the second floor windows and projecting brick cornice that visually divides the first and second stories. This emphasis on horizontality achieved through the coping and polychromed brickwork is a key element of the architecture of the Prairie School, pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright and his contemporaries. The interior continues to show the influence of Wright in the geometric and floral motifs incorporated on columns and pilasters.\\" The flat roof and second-floor staircase, as well as the ornaments on the outside and the inside lend themselves to the Prairie School. And on the whole, the entire building, inside and out reflects a coordinated geometrical approach to architecture that is unlike any other in the city. ==Merger with library system after the end of segregation== The Carnegie Colored Library was in operation on its own until the end of segregation when it then joined the larger Savannah Public Library system in 1963. With the end of segregation, the Carnegie Library joined with the larger Savannah Public Library system in 1963. This meant that African‐Americans were able to access the Bull Street Library for the first time. The cultural importance of Carnegie remained, even as the educational necessity waned. At the end of the 20th century, the Carnegie Library had slipped into disrepair and closed. ==Renovation and restoration== In 2001 the Live Oak Public Libraries set forth a campaign to renovate and expand the historic building. It closed in 1997 due to a leaking roof, water damage, and a lack of funding. A fund-raising effort began and was able to support a $1.3 million renovation which was completed. Wings on either side of the original building were built. The library also received the latest technical equipment, such as a new classroom designed to provide interactive computer learning. Collections which were moved for safety were returned, and expanded to a collection of 3,000, with an emphasis on the Harlem Renaissance. The restructuring was done in the same architectural style as the building was initially erected in, and all additions would adhere to the library's historical roots. The addition was completed in 2003 on the 90th anniversary of its first opening. After the renovation the library received multiple awards from organizations on both the state and national levels. In 2004 the library was awarded by the Historic Savannah Foundation the Historic Preservation Award. In 2005 the building received multiple awards from the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation; the 2005 Georgia Preservation Award, as well as the 2005 Marguerite Williams Award which recognizes one project which had the greatest impact on preservation in the state. Also in 2005 the library won the National Preservation Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The centennial of the library was held in August 2014, when a historical marker was erected in front of the building denoting the history of the location and building for the Savannah community. ==References== == External links == * The Georgia Historical Society.

After emancipation she graduated from Hampton University (1882), an HBCU in Virginia where she then taught for a while before moving to Mount Meigs, Alabama, and starting a small school there called the People's Village School. At the time, Mount Meigs was a rural area with a significant African-American population, and the school's first building was a small cabin, 12 by 13 feet, where Washington had four boys as students. Washington is buried on the school grounds. ===Subsequent history=== By 1916 enrollment had reached 225. Washington herself retired in 1936, and after her death in 1952 the school was renamed for her. In 1943 the school was deeded to Montgomery Public Schools. It became a junior high school in 1970, and a middle school in 2012. By 2017 enrollment was 600. In 2018, controversy arose because the Montgomery school system, headed by an interim superintendent while under state oversight, announced the sale of the school to the Pike Road Municipal school system; a lawsuit to stop the sale was filed by the Alabama Education Association on behalf of three teachers and parents. The sale would mandate that the school keep its name and that her grave be maintained. ==References== Category:Education in Montgomery, Alabama Category:Educational institutions established in 1983 Category:Public middle schools in Alabama Category:1893 establishments in Alabama ","title":"Georgia Washington Middle School"},{"id":"56674427","text":"Mohammed Alfar (born 3 March 1998) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

He appealed for funding from the North. In May 1865 he adopted a set of labor regulations he drafted for Louisiana while under the authority of Major General Stephen Hurlbut.

The genus contains a single described species, Boltonimecia canadensis, and is known from a single Late Cretaceous fossil which was found in Canada. The type species was originally described as a species of the extinct genus Sphecomyrma under the combination Sphecomyrma canadensis. ==History and classification== Boltonimecia is known from a single adult fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"CAS 330\\" entombed in an amber chunk. At the time of the genus description, the specimen was residing in the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes, in Ottawa, Canada. The described specimen is of a worker caste adult which has been preserved as an inclusion in a transparent orange chunk of Canadian amber. The amber specimen was recovered in situ from the Taber coal zone near the top of Foremost Formation around Grassy Lake which is near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. Canadian amber has been dated to an age of approximately 79–78 million years old, placing it in the Campanian of the Late Cretaceous. Two workers were first studied by paleoentomologist E. O. Wilson in 1985, a holotype and less complete paratype, both of which were held in the collections of the Biosystematics Research Institute in Ottawa. In the type description they were placed by Wilson as a species of Sphecomyrma, Sphecomyrma canadensis, with the species name a reference to the country of discovery. The similarity of visible traits between S. freyi and \\"S.\\" canadensis was mentioned by Wilson in the description, but little descriptive information distinguishing the two was provided. It was noted in 1988 by Dlussky and Fedoseeva that the original description was based mostly on measurements alone and further that the holotype and paratype workers were likely not from the same ant genus. In 1996, Dlussky noted the antennae of \\"S.\\" canadensis differed from S. freyi, having a longer first and fifth funicular segments, while in S. freyi it is the second segment which is longest. An analysis and re-examination of the type workers was conducted by Leonid H. Borysenko of the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes and the results were published in a 2017 paper. While examining the holotype, Borysenko noted that most of the head along with parts of the antennae and mandibles were obscured by positioning in the amber. Sections of the specimen were re-polished and a number of new details became visible, allowing for the re-description of the extinct species into a new genus, Boltonimecia. The genus name was coined as a patronym in honor of the myrmecologist Barry Bolton. Borysenko placed Boltonimecia into a new tribe of Sphecomyrminae, Zigrasimeciini along with the sister genus Zigrasimecia. Examination of the paratype worker led Borysenko to conclude that the ant was too fragmented and no identifying characters were present, and thus not to be included as a paratype. Head of Zigrasimecia ferox ==Paleohabitat== Analysis of the composition of Canadian amber indicates it originated as cupressaceous resins which were deposited in lagoons and salt water marshes along the Western Interior Seaway. Based on the diversity of included Ceratopogonidae flies, Borkent in 1995 suggested the paleohabitat was a mix of salt marshes, wetland pools and moist sands. This mixture is supported by the presence of Haplophragmoides species foraminiferan tests, which are indicators of brackish waters, and crocodylian scutes found associated with the amber. While few vegetative remains are found associated with Canadian amber, spectroscopic analysis and rare entombed foliage indicated the cupressaceous tree which produced the amber is likely a species of Parataxodium. Parataxodium is related to modern Taxodium and Glyptostrobus and shared a similar habitat preference of marshy areas. Boltonimecia canadensis is one of several ant species that have been described from Canadian amber, the others include Cananeuretus occidentalis, Canapone dentata, Chronomyrmex medicinehatensis, Eotapinoma macalpini, and Haidoterminus cippus. ==Description== B. canadensis head, anterodorsal view The holotype worker is long with an head and a Weber's length of . Much of the body is the same coloration as the surrounding amber, while the lower half of the propodeum and underside of the gaster are a brown to black tone. Additionally the undersides of the coxae plus the upper halves of the tibiae are brown to black, while the upper surfaces of the head and pronotum are an opaque black tone. There is no distinct sculpturing to the exoskeleton surface. The head is small and wider than long, with a generally triangular outline in dorsal view. The upper surface is thickened into a shield with a curved and raised profile and two elongated processes extend out and slightly forward from the rear of the head. The eyes are either reduced to such a degree that they are not visible, or are possibly lost all together, and no ocelli are visible. The clypeus is small and strongly curved, with the front margin that faces the inner sides of the mandibles covered in 25, long, peg- like setae. Each mandible is curved almost 90˚ with the bases covered by the edges of the clypeus lobes. On the mandible's ends are two teeth, a smaller sub-apical one and a larger apical one with a groove that likely matches the position of the opposite mandible placement when they are closed. The antennae are distinctly 11-segmented, with a curved scape that just reaches the rear margin of the head capsule when reclined. ==ReferencesCategory:Monotypic fossil ant genera Category:Cretaceous insects Category:Fossil taxa described in 2017 † Category:Sphecomyrminae Category:Fossil insects of North America Category:Canadian amber ","title":"Boltonimecia"},{"id":"56674744","text":"Thalassobacillus cyri is a Gram-positive, moderately halophilic, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and motil bacterium from the genus of Thalassobacillus which has been isolated from brine from the Howz Soltan Lake in Iran. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Thalassobacillus cyri at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2009 ","title":"Thalassobacillus cyri"},{"id":"56674761","text":"Elise Hughes is a Welsh footballer who plays as a forward for Blackburn Rovers in the FA Women's Championship on loan from Everton in the FA WSL and the Welsh national team. ==Early and personal life== Hughes was born in Hawarden.

CITED: p. 673. ==Carnegie Colored Library== African Americans were prohibited from accessing the Houston Lyceum and Carnegie Library, so African American leaders organized their own public library in Houston's Booker T. Washington High School in 1909. Native Houstonian Emmett J. Scott and his boss Booker T. Washington secured a Carnegie Library grant to help pay for a new building. It was designed by William Sidney Pittman, a prominent African American architect and the son-in-law of Booker T. WashingtonHouston Lost and Unbuilt page 23 (includes a photo of the building during its dedication ceremony in 1912) and was constructed in 1913. It faced Frederick Street. The board overseeing the institution was composed entirely of African Americans. In 1921 the city of Houston disbanded the library board and made the library a branch of the Houston Public Library system. Charles Norton Love, an African American civil rights activist and publisher of the Texas Freeman helped advocate for construction and funding of the library. Houston's public library system was desegregated in 1953. The neoclassical library building was demolished in 1962 to make way for Interstate 45 that cut through Houston's Fourth Ward. Page 23 of Houston Lost and Unbuilt includes photos of the Carnegie Colored Library during its dedication in 1912, architectural plans, and a photo of city leaders and African American officials during demolition. === Legacy === The Carnegie Colored Library was a turning point for library services in the segregated South. Through the work of librarian Julia Ideson and an all-black committee made up of Houston leaders, African Americans were active participants in planning and governing their own library. The Carnegie Colored Library, though it provided services that were nonexistent before, still existed and operated in a segregationist structure that provided unequal services and collections. However, the Carnegie Colored Library model \\"moved beyond the lobbying of local white librarians and city officials\\" to a national strategy in which black leaders could proclaim themselves \\"actors in the civic and cultural politics that influenced their city, the services it provided, and its built environment.\\" ==See also== * History of African Americans in Houston ==References== Category:Libraries in Houston ","title":"W.L.D.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Tullynaconspod is bounded on the north by Gowlan townland, on the west by Tullyveela townland, on the south by Corrachomera townland and on the east by Owencam townland. Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, gravel pits and dug wells. Tullynaconspod is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 140 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. The origin of the name probably arose from a battle fought there. The 1930s Dúchas Folklore collection states- A battle was fought in Crocán na gCamps, Derryconnessy, Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Crocán na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. About 100–200 years ago battles were fought in the Townlands of Tullyvella and Conspud between the dead people who fought at the battle of Crocán na gCamps. In the morning after these battles were fought, the heather would be red with blood. One night there was a fight in Conspud and a man heard a voice calling him by his Christian name, that a neighbour's house was on fire. He looked out and saw the neighbour's house on fire, but he did not go to it. Next day the house was not burned, but was as if nothing happened. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list three tithepayers in the townland (which is named Disputed Hill in the Tithe Books). and and Tithe Applotment Books 1827 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- The soil is intermixed with lime and freestone...There is no county cess levied on this townland as it is considered only a track of mountain. It is bounded on the north by a large mountain stream. The Tullynaconspod Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 55, being 33 males and 22 females. There were nine houses in the townland, all were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 25, being 17 males and 8 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were five houses in the townland, all inhabited.

Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the film stars Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Hudgens, Katheryn Winnick and Matt Lucas. It revolves around an aging assassin on the verge of retirement, who himself becomes targeted by his employer willing to cash in on his pension. The film was released on January 25, 2019, streaming on Netflix as an original. ==Plot== Duncan Vizla, aka \\"the Black Kaiser\\", is an assassin working for a company named Damocles. In 14 days, upon reaching mandatory retirement on his 50th birthday, Duncan is set to receive half his pension, amounting to $8 million. He is unaware that Mr. Blut, Damocles' owner, intends to sell Damocles and is having all assassins approaching retirement killed by other Damocles operators, thus retaining their pension funds and inflating the company's value. This is possible because a Damocles contract clause stipulates that, should employees die without a will or named beneficiary, the company receives all their pension assets. Duncan is the latest operative to be hunted down. Blut sends a team of assassins to hunt down Duncan who's starting to get closer to his neighbor Camille. The team raids all of Duncan's residences and kill the people staying there, but to no avail. One day, as Duncan purchases a gift for Camille, he is spotted and the assassins trap him with the help of their member Sindy. Believing her car has actually broken down, Duncan gives her a ride and takes her to his home where they engage in sexual activity as a part of the team's plan. However, as the sniper tries to take the shot, Sindy gets shot and Duncan kills her upon learning of her betrayal. He eliminates the entire team by himself and goes to their motel, where a drugged member reveals the team went to capture Camille. Returning home, Duncan finds her missing and goes to meet his friend at a bar in order to find out why is he wanted dead. Duncan is betrayed, tranquilized and captured by Blut who physically tortures him for 3 days and half-blinds him while drugging and assaulting Camille at the same time. On the fourth day, Duncan manages to free himself and eliminates Blut's entire gang by himself. He contacts Blut's assistant Vivian to make a deal: his life for Camille's. He is healed by a friend who supplies him guns to deal with Blut's army. Through a phone call, Duncan is traced by Vivian and her team. Duncan gives her a chance to walk away, but she doesn't. Using machine guns armed with lasers, he eliminates the entire team while leaving Vivian for dead. As he goes to kill Blut, the terrified henchmen walk away. He beheads Blut and rescues Camille, keeping her at his house and taking care of her. Later, he wakes up to find clippings of a murder on the bed where Camille was sleeping, and finds himself held on gunpoint by her. It is then revealed he killed her family but left her alive as a child, because he received wrong information. As Camille grew up, he redeemed himself by looking after her and financing her education secretly. As Camille is unable to let go of the pain, Duncan tells her to close her eyes and pull the trigger. The bullet is fired, but it's soon revealed Camille didn't shoot him and instead joins him to find out who ordered the hit on her father. ==Cast== ==Production== The film was first announced in October 2014 as a live action adaptation of Dark Horse Comics' Polar, developed by Dark Horse Entertainment and Constantin Film. A spec script for the film by Jayson Rothwell was purchased. In October 2017, Mads Mikkelsen signed on to star in the film. In February 2018, Vanessa Hudgens, Katheryn Winnick and Matt Lucas joined the cast with Netflix onboard to distribute the film. Filming began early February 2018 in Orono, Ontario, Canada, and continued around February 23 in Toronto, Ontario, with noted Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund at the helm. In September 2018, musician Deadmau5 announced that he was in the process of producing the film's original score. Netflix started streaming the film on January 25, 2019, with Deadmau5 releasing the soundtrack on the same day. ==Soundtrack== The film's soundtrack album was released by Deadmau5 on January 25, 2019, through his record label Mau5trap. The soundtrack's release details were announced on January 8, 2019, along with the film's initial trailer. A single from the soundtrack album, \\"Midas Heel\\" was released on January 11, 2019, followed by the vocal version called \\"Drama Free\\" featuring Lights which was previously released on Mau5ville: Level 2. Several tracks of the score (such as \\"Somb\\", \\"Wilhelm\\" and \\"End\\") feature elements from Deadmau5's previous tracks from his seventh studio album While(1<2), as well as two new tracks named \\"Nosedive\\" and \\"Camilla\\", the former being a remake of his unreleased track \\"Rio\\", the latter being known previously as \\"Suite 02\\". ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 19% based on 47 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.17/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An action thriller starring Mads Mikkelsen as the world's most dangerous assassin should be terrifically entertaining, but Polar proves it's possible to ruin anything if you try.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 19 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". ==Future== Director Jonas Åkerlund has teased possible sequel ideas for the Netflix film Polar. Adapted from the web series-turned-graphic novel from Spanish author Víctor Santos (author) owned by Dark Horse Comics, Polar is based on the first book in the series and stars Mads Mikkelsen. During a Polar interview with Screen Rant, Åkerlund opened up about the possibilities of a live-action Polar sequel. Considering that the graphic novels offer more stories to tell within Duncan's life post-retirement, he explained that fans have more to look forward to if his first adaptation ends up warranting more entries. When asked if there were any elements from the source material that he would like to incorporate into potential sequels, he said: \\"It's supposed to be based on the first book, but we kind of borrowed a little bit from the second and the third book as well. And we also added some stuff that aren't even in the book. So, we had the freedom of working with these characters as we wanted - and, yeah, the Polar story has way more to give. He [Silva] actually wrote five books, and there's a lot more stories in there; and the characters are great, so why not?\\" While Åkerlund seems enthusiastic about returning for a sequel, the same can evidently be said for Mikkelsen as well. Though he didn't read the Polar books until he got the role, Mikkelsen used to be a \\"huge graphic novel collector.\\" Before the world of comics and graphic novels became a mainstream medium, Mikkelsen collected his fair share roughly 20 years ago. Though Åkerlund didn't specify what parts of the story he'd want to cover in potential live-action sequels, the plot of the graphic novel's sequel, Polar: An Eye for an Eye, is a clear extension of the film's cliffhanger ending. In fact, without spoiling the film's ending, the events of Polar serve as a perfect origin story for a potential franchise, satisfying one character arc in particular that would no doubt be deeply satisfying for fans. Whether or not audiences ultimately get to see it on film, however, remains to be seen. ==References== ==External links== * on Netflix * Category:2019 films Category:2019 action thriller films Category:Constantin Film films Category:Dark Horse Entertainment films Category:Films based on Dark Horse Comics Category:Films directed by Jonas Åkerlund Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:American films Category:American neo-noir films Category:American action thriller films ","title":"Polar (film)"},{"id":"56674986","text":"The Trasimeno chub (Squalius albus) is a cyprinid fish endemic to Lake Trasimeno in Italy. ==References== Category:Squalius Category:Fish described in 1838 ","title":"Trasimeno chub"},{"id":"56674991","text":"Gertrude 'Trude' Wildam was a female Austrian international table tennis player.

Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), forestry plantations, gravel pits and dug wells. Tullandreen is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 115 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Tullinderreen.

Bred and owned by the 17th Earl of Derby she was the product of a mating between two St Leger winners and won the race herself in 1919. She was unraced as a juvenile but developed into a top-class stayer at three, winning the Gratwicke Stakes and the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse before taking the St Leger and later winning the Newmarket Oaks. She failed to win as a four-year-old in 1920 although she was placed in all of her races. After her retirement from racing, she had considerable success as a broodmare despite producing very few foals. ==Background== Keysoe was a brown mare reportedly standing 17 hands high bred in England by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. During her racing career she was trained by George Lambton at the Stanley House stable near Newmarket, Suffolk. Her sire Swynford was an outstanding racehorse who won the St Leger in 1910 and the Eclipse Stakes in the following year. He was even better as a breeding stallion with his other offspring including Blandford, Saucy Sue, Challenger, Tranquil and Sansovino. Keysoe's dam Keystone II was an exceptional racemare who won the Epsom Oaks in 1906. ==Racing career== ===1919: three-year-old season=== Keysoe's owner Lord Derby Keysoe was unraced as a two-year-old and began her racing career in the spring of 1919. In May 1919, she ran in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket but finished unplaced behind Roseway. Her performance came as a disappointment to her connections who had regarded her as superior to her stablemate Glaciale, who finished third. In June she finished unplaced behind Flying Spear in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. At Goodwood Racecourse on 29 July she recorded her first success as she won the Gratwicke Stakes \\"in a canter\\" by eight lengths from Britannia and Misty Morning. At the same track in August she followed up by winning the ten furlong Nassau Stakes winning at odds of 13/8. She then contracted a respiratory infection and started \\"coughing\\" which disrupted her training. On 10 September Keysoe was moved up in class to contest 144th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs in at Doncaster Racecourse. Wartime restrictions meant that the race had been run at Newmarket since 1914 and the return of the race to its traditional venue attracted an enormous crowd with spectators packed hundreds deep along the half-mile straight. The crowd included the 85-year-old ex- jockey John Osborne who won the race on Lord Clifden and Apology and was attending his 66th St Leger. Ridden by the Australian jockey Bernard \\"Brownie\\" Carslake Keysoe started at odds of 100/8 (12.5/1) against nine opponents including Buchan who had finished runner-up in both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby and started 8/11 favourite ahead of the Prince of Wales's Stakes winner Dominion and the Irish challenger Cheap Popularity. In a slowly-run race, Keysoe led for most of the way and then \\"shot ahead\\" in the straight to win \\"very easily indeed\\" by six lengths from Dominion with Buchan two lengths back in third. Three weeks after her Leger Triumph Keysoe started 4/6 favourite for the Kingsclere Stakes at Newbury Racecourse but was defeated at level weights by the Park Hill Stakes winner Flying Spear. Later that month she returned to winning form, taking the Newmarket Oaks over fourteen furlongs when conceding fourteen pounds to the runner-up Palatina. On her final appearance of the season she was beaten by Pomme de Terre in the Liverpool St Leger on 5 November. ===1920: four-year-old season=== Keysoe remained in training as a four-year-old in 1920. In May she finished second to Kentish Cob in the Burwell Stakes at Newmarket and was then beaten by the colt Our Stephen (her only opponent) in the Great Northern Handicap at York. In the Ascot Gold Cup in June she came home fourth behind Buchan, Tangiers and Juveigneur, but was promoted to third after Buchan was disqualified for crossing the runner- up. In August Keysoe finished third behind Iron hand and Manilardo in the Ebor Handicap at York. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Keysoe as an \\"inferior\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career Keysoe was retired to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced few foals but at least two top-class performers. Her progeny included: *Caissot, a chestnut colt, foaled in 1923, sired by Gay Crusader. Won Prince of Wales's Stakes and second in the St Leger. *Flittermere, chestnut filly, 1926, by Buchan. Won Yorkshire Oaks. Grand-dam of Ballymoss *Papworth, black colt, 1929, by Papyrus ==Pedigree== * Keysoe was inbred 3 × 4 to St Simon,meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree. She was also inbred 4 × 4 to both Isonomy and Hermit. ==References== Category:1916 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 2-u Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Keysoe (horse)"},{"id":"56675589","text":"The list of shipwrecks in January 1833 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during January 1833. ==1 January== ==2 January== ==3 January== ==4 January== ==5 January== ==6 January== ==7 January== ==8 January== ==9 January== ==10 January== ==11 January== ==12 January== ==13 January== ==14 January== ==15 January== ==16 January== ==17 January== ==18 January== ==21 January== ==22 January== ==24 January== ==25 January== ==26 January== ==27 January== ==28 January== ==29 January== ==31 January== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1833-01 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in January 1833"},{"id":"56675592","text":"Ek Lootere is a Hindi action drama film of Bollywood directed by Jitendra Chawda and produced by Kajal Mukherjee.

He created, with 28 founding members, the neuropathological club, which would eventually become the British Neuropathological Society. Greenfield served as pathologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square. ==Early Life== Godwin Greenfield was born in Edinburgh, Scotland to William S. Greenfield, who was chair of pathology and clinical medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Godwin Greenfield began his early education at the Edinburgh Academy before becoming a boarder at the Merchiston Castle School. ==Career== Greenfield served as house physician under Alexander Bruce and helped arrange lectures for Byrom Bramwell during his first year of residency at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He later served as house physician at East London Hospital for Children and at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square, London. Greenfield then became assistant pathologist to Matthew Stewart at the General Infirmary at Leeds in 1912, but returned to Queen's Square two years later where he became the chair of pathology, a post he held until his retirement in 1949. During his first few years as pathologist, he also volunteered for a commission from the Royal Army Medical Corps and was deployed in France during World War I, notably serving during the Great Retreat from Mons. In 1917 he was appointed to a RAMC center in Tooting for treatment of nervous system injuries, and returned to his post at Queen's Square at the end of his commission in 1919. Following the outbreak of World War II 1939, the National Hospital at Queen's Square was evacuated, and Greenfield relocated to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield Town where he organized pathological services. He returned to London in 1945. During his career, Greenfield made several significant contributions to the field of neuropathology and received several honors. In 1917, Greenfield took membership in the Royal College of Physicians, earned his MD with a gold medal from the University of Edinburgh in 1921, and was elected a fellow of the college in 1925. During his time at the National Hospital, Greenfield collaborated with Farquhar Buzzard on several publications, including research on von Economo’s encephalitis in 1919 and Pathology of the Nervous System in 1921. Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy is occasionally known by the eponym Greenfield's disease because of his work studying its pathophysiology and histology. Greenfield played an important role in defining neuropathology as a distinct discipline, including lecturing to the Royal College of physicians on 'the pathology of the neuron' in 1939. In 1950, Greenfield and 28 of his colleagues started a 'neuropathological club' to organize discussion of difficult cases and help unify clinical and experimental aspects of the field. This club eventually became the British Neuropathological Society. He organized and lectured at the First International Congress of Neuropathologists in 1952 and presided the Second International Congress of Neuropathologists in 1955. Godwin Greenfield retired from the National Hospital staff in 1949, but continued research and lecturing and frequently visited the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness in Bethesda, Maryland. Greenfield died of a heart attack in 1958 following a farewell dinner in Bethesda. His text, Greenfield's Neuropathology, was published posthumously later that year and became an important reference in the field. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School Category:British neurologists Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers ","title":"Joseph Godwin Greenfield"},{"id":"56675702","text":"Ortaklar railway station is a railway station in Ortaklar, Turkey.

He was relieved of command duties in 1998 after the fall of Soeharto and was subsequently deemed responsible for abductions of pro-democracy activists. In 2008, he was acquitted of commissioning and assisting in the 2004 assassination of human rights campaigner Munir, following a trial deemed flawed by human rights organizations. He is presently the leader of a breakaway faction of Tommy Soeharto’s Berkarya Party and his leadership is recognized by the government. ==Early life== Muchdi was born on 15 April 1949 in Sleman, Yogyakarta. He is the sixth of nine siblings. He has said his father was a leader of Masyumi, an Islamic party, and his mother's family belonged to the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim mass organization. As a teenager, Muchdi was involved in the Indonesian Muslim Students (PII). Later, he served as deputy chairman of the Family of Indonesian Muslim Students (KBPII), an organization that considers communism and LGBT among the greatest threats to Indonesia. Muchdi has expressed pride in having been a member of \\"Generation 66\\", the generation that helped to bring down founding president Sukarno and replace him with Suharto. Muchdi said he was involved in the Indonesian Student Youth Action Front (KAPPI) in Yogyakarta and often took part in demonstrations. ==Military career== After completing high school, Muchdi entered the Military Academy in 1967 and graduated in 1970. He served in East Timor four times. Muchdi became close to fellow soldier Prabowo Subianto, as both were tough fighters and Muslims. Muchdi's later promotions in the military were attributed to his connection to Prabowo, who in 1983 had married then-president Suharto's daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi. Starting in 1995, Muchdi was promoted three times in three years from colonel to brigadier general to major general. Muchdi has said that in 1986, while he was training at the Army Staff and Command College (Seskoad) in Bandung, he was summoned by the Intelligence Task Force of the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib) in Jakarta and detained for three days on accusations of having been a member of the Pemuda Rakyat (People's Youth) division of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) prior to his entry to AKABRI (the Indonesian Armed Forces Academy). He countered that his parents and family had actually been targets of the PKI in Yogyakarta 1965. Muchdi served in territorial command posts in Irian Jaya (now Papua) from the late 1980s to mid-1990s, Jambi (1995-96), East Java (1996-97) and Kalimantan (1997-98). In 1998, he was Kopassus commander for three months. In May 1998 he was removed from structural duties following the resignation of Suharto. In August 1998 an Indonesian Military (TNI) Officers' Honorary Council (Dewan Kehormatan Perwira) ruled Muchdi was among those responsible for the 1997-98 kidnappings of pro-democracy activists. After that, Muchdi was a general without a command portfolio at TNI headquarters. ===Military and intelligence positions=== * 1971-1972: Platoon Commander of Taruna Military Academy * 1972-1974: Para-commando Platoon Commander * 1974-1979: Para- commando Company Commander * 1979-1988: Commander of Karsa Yudha special warfare group * 1988-1995: Commander of 1701 Jayapura Military District (Irian Jaya, now Papua) * 1993-1995: Chief-of-staff of Biak 173 Military Resort Command (Irian Jaya, now Papua) * 1995-1996: Commander of 042 Military Resort Command/Garuda Putih (Jambi) (rank of Colonel) * 1996-1997: Chief of staff of Military District Command V/Brawijawa (East Java) (rank of Brigadier General) * 1997: Operations Assistant for Military Regional Command IX/Udayana (Bali and Eastern Indonesia) * 1997-1998: Commander-in chief of Military Regional Command VI/Tanjungpura (Kalimantan) (rank of Major General) * March-May 1998: Chief of Kopassus * 1998-2001: Senior Officer without command at TNI Headquarters * 2001-2005: Deputy chief V of State Intelligence Agency (BIN) ===Promotion to Kopassus chief=== Muchdi's promotion to the leadership of Kopassus on 28 March 1998 came at the behest of his friend and predecessor Prabowo, who was being promoted to chief of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad). Then-Army chief Wiranto opposed Muchdi being installed as Kopassus chief and instead favored Brigadier General Sang Nyoman Suwisma, a Hindu. But Wiranto was outmaneuvered by Prabowo, who was close to Suharto. As Wiranto recounted in his memoir Witness in the Storm: Muchdi spent fewer than 60 days as Kopassus chief amid the financial crisis, riots and pro-democracy movement that led to Suharto's resignation. ===Loss of Kopasus command=== When Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998, Muchdi accompanied Prabowo to the Jakarta residence of new president B.J. Habibie at 11pm to present a draft cabinet line-up and recommended changes to the military leadership. Later that night, Muchdi reported to a gathering of Muslim leaders the meeting with Habibie had gone well. However, Habibie instead favored General Wiranto, who recommended Muchdi be sacked as Kopassus chief. After Habibie agreed, Wiranto instructed Army chief Subagyo Hadiswoyo to relieve Prabowo and Muchdi of their duties. During the May 1998 riots, Wiranto had assigned Kopassus officers, under the command of Muchdi, to protect Habibie's Jakarta house. These officers outnumbered the presidential guards at Habibie's house on 21 May and initially refused to leave without orders from Muchdi, but were convinced to leave on the evening of 22 May. On the afternoon of 22 May, Prabowo met with Muchdi at the state palace. Prabowo wanted more time before he and Muchdi would be transferred to non-combat positions, to create the perception that it was a normal military rotation, but Wiranto insisted on the changes being made immediately. On the morning of 23 May, Subagyo removed Muchdi from the command of Kopassus. Major-General Syahrir was sworn-in as the new Kopassus chief on May 25. Muchdi was shifted to the non-combat role of deputy inspector general of TNI. On 1 March 2001, Muchdi was among 55 generals present at an Army headquarters meeting that agreed the Army should never try to seize power. ==Abductions of activists== From early 1997 to May 1998, Kopassus troops kidnapped 23 pro-democracy activists with the aim of intimidating opponents of Suharto's autocratic regime. One of the activists was found dead, nine were released and 13 never reappeared. Survivors said they were tortured. Responding to demands for justice after Suharto's resignation in May 1998, TNI convened an Officers Honor Council, which in August 1998 found that Prabowo and Muchdi bore responsibility for the abductions. According to The Indonesian Army by Joseph Daves, the Officers Honor Council decided Prabowo and Muchdi should be granted immunity from civil prosecution in return for their cooperation. The two reportedly said Suharto gave verbal orders to abduct dissidents and subsequently to “finish them off”. The Officers Honor Council ruled Prabowo and Muchdi had misinterpreted Suharto's order. Chief of the Officers Honor Council, General Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, said Prabowo and Muchdi either gave instructions for the abductions or were aware of their issuance. He said Muchdi, as Kopassus chief, must have fully understood his authority and duties. In 2008, when Muchdi was tried for orchestrating the murder of human rights activist Munir, his lawyer argued he had no connection to the abductions because he was in Kalimantan when they took place. In a 2008 interview, Muchdi said he had actually ordered the release of the remaining activists when he became Kopassus chief. ==Treason allegation== In March 2001, President Abdurrahman Wahid accused Forestry Ministry secretary general Suripto of meeting with Muchdi at Jakarta's Kempinski Hotel to plot treason. Police questioned Muchdi, who said he had met with Suripto only to discuss logging concessions. Suripto also denied plotting treason. He said Muchdi owns a timber company in West Kalimantan, so they had met several times at Suripto's office to discuss the timber business. Wahid was impeached and removed from office four months later. ==BIN career== In June 2000, detikcom online news portal speculated Muchdi had been nominated to replace Air Vice Marshal Ian Santoso as director of the Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS, responsible to Military Headquarters), while there was also a claim Prabowo had advised then-President Abdurrahman Wahid to appoint Muchdi as head of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (Bakin, responsible to the President), which was headed by Lieutenant General Arie J. Kumaat. BAKIN was in January 2001 restructured and renamed the State Intelligence Agency (BIN). After Abdurrahman Wahid was impeached in July 2001, his successor Megawati Sukarnoputri appointed Hendropriyono to lead BIN on 9 August 2001. In December 2001, Muchdi was appointed Deputy V of BIN. In March 2005, he was positioned as a BIN principal agent. In April 2003, he retired from the military and had the status of a Group 4 civil servant. On 1 January 2008, he retired as a Group 4 civil servant. ===Terrorism investigations and infiltration=== After the October 2002 Bali bombings that left 202 people dead, Muchdi – in his capacity as deputy head of BIN – headed a joint intelligence task force that complemented the police investigation into the terror attack. The formal separation of the Indonesian Military and Police in 1999 had compromised the intelligence capabilities of the police force, which lacked a database on radical groups. Hence, Muchdi's task force was required to provide police with military intelligence, as BIN had a database on extremists. Muchdi's group reportedly pursued suspects in Sumbawa, West Nusa Tenggara province. Two weeks after the bombings, BIN asked police to arrest seven suspects, but police were unable to make the arrests based on BIN's evidence. The Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI), founded by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, suspected it had been penetrated by BIN operatives. Tempo magazine in December 2002 reported a senior BIN operative, Abdul Harris, had entered MMI at its inception and served as head of its international relations division. His true identity was reportedly exposed during a meeting of Muslim leaders at a religious gathering at Muchdi's house. According to the book After Bali: The Threat of Terrorism in Southeast Asia, Muchdi introduced Harris to the Muslim leaders as a “BIN operative”. ==Munir murder trial and acquittal== In August 2008, Muchdi went on trial at South Jakarta District Court, accused of soliciting and planning the September 2004 murder of human rights activist Munir. The killing was perpetrated by an off-duty Garuda pilot and alleged BIN agent named Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto. In earlier trials, Garuda chief executive Indra Setiawan testified he had met with Muchdi and received a verbal and written request from BIN to assign Pollycarpus to a flight that Munir made from Jakarta to Singapore. Evidence showed 41 phone calls were made between Pollycarpus and Muchdi in the days surrounding the murder. Budi Santoso, a former BIN director, told police in October 2007 and May 2008 that Pollycarpus and BIN agent Kawan had told him Muchdi ordered them to kill Munir. Budi further said he had often seen Pollycarpus inside Muchdi's office at BIN headquarters. When Muchdi went on trial, Budi failed to appear as a witness. Prosecutors argued Muchdi carried a grudge against Munir, as the activist's exposure of the 1997-98 abductions had led to Muchdi losing his position as Kopassus chief. Muchdi's lawyers responded that Muchdi had lost his position because of the fall of Suharto and not because of Munir's actions. Some activists asserted Munir's assassination was masterminded by officials higher than Muchdi. Soldiers, intelligence officials and thugs were present during Muchdi's trial, prompting complaints it was an effort to intimidate judges, prosecutors and witnesses. Some witnesses failed to appear, and others who had previously provided incriminating statements to police withdrew them at trial. Tensions were evident at the trial when Munir's widow Suciwati urged Muchdi to tell the truth. He responded by snapping at her, “Shut up, you!” before he exited. Muchdi was acquitted on December 31, 2008. In June 2009, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal. Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) said the investigation, prosecution and trial of Muchdi were flawed, and recommended a new police investigation. President Joko Widodo promised to resolve the case but there has been no follow-up. Prior to his acquittal, Muchdi said those who pushed for his trial are the \\"henchmen of foreign imperialism\\", trying to destabilize Indonesia's national resilience. He claimed their long-term goal is to weaken Indonesia's justice, political, economic and religious institutions. He said Dutch agencies that investigated the murder of Munir cannot be trusted because the Dutch previously colonized Indonesia and committed human rights violations. He said the only state institution in Indonesia that had not been infiltrated by foreign interests was the judiciary. After Muchdi's acquittal, three floral congratulatory boards were delivered to his South Jakarta residence. All three were from PT Bayu Buana Gemilang, a natural gas trading company where his son and daughter work. Muchdi celebrated his acquittal by treating 40 orphans to a thanksgiving dinner at his house in Kebayoran Baru neighborhood. Commenting on the verdict, he said, \\"This is a gift for the nation of Indonesia.\\" In 2016, Muchdi said Indonesian human rights campaigners still calling for Munir's case to be resolved were merely exploiting the case in order to gain funds from the Netherlands. ==Political career== In 2008, Muchdi joined Prabowo's newly formed Gerindra Party and served as deputy chairman. He became “non-active” in the party pending his murder trial but resumed his position after being acquitted at the end of 2008. In June 2010, Muchdi attempted to become Central Executive of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim organization, Muhammadiyah, even though he did not meet the requirement of being a member for at least six years. In February 2011, Muchdi quit Gerindra and joined the Islam-based United Development Party (PPP), saying \\"only PPP is still purely Islamic today”. He declined to explicitly explain his reason for leaving, but Gerindra member Desmon Junaidi Mahesa said Muchdi's move to PPP was an effort to raise support for Prabowo in the 2014 presidential election. In March 2011, Muchdi declared he would run for the leadership of PPP, despite having joined the party only a month earlier. He claimed that as an Islamic activist, he wanted to reverse PPP's declining popularity in elections. In May 2011, Muchdi was elected head of the Daily Regional Leadership Council (DPW) of PPP for Papua province for the period 2011–2015. Party officials in the province hoped his leadership would mobilize Papuans to vote for PPP in future general elections. However, PPP officials in Jakarta rejected Muchdi's election as illegal, claiming the voting process was legally flawed. Muchdi responded by filing a police complaint against four senior PPP members, accusing them of slander and defamation. In June 2011, when PPP held a congress in the West Java capital of Bandung to elect a new leader, Muchdi withdrew from the race, saying he was ineligible to stand for the position. In January 2012, it was reported Muchdi had joined the National Republic Party (Nasrep) of former president Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as Tommy Suharto. Muchdi served as a member of the party's advisory council and officials hoped he would strengthen the party's political machinery. In 2016, when Nasrep merged with another small party, Beringin Karya Party, to form Berkarya Party as a political vehicle for Tommy Suharto, Muchdi was appointed chairman of the party's Honorary Board. In March 2018, Muchdi said he was not bothered by the “small matter” of efforts to link him to Munir's murder, as he had already been found not guilty, so the case was resolved. He said the accusations would actually strengthen Berkarya because of his innocence. He claimed to be unaware Munir's murderer Pollycarpus Priyanto had also joined the party. Berkarya in 2018 announced it was supporting Prabowo Subianto's candidacy for Indonesia's 2019 presidential election. Muchdi in February 2019 announced he was instead supporting President Joko Widodo's bid for re-election. He said Jokowi, in his first term in office, had achieved more than any other president in Indonesia's reform period, improving roads, ports, airports and industry. Mucdhi said he did not think his friend Prabowo could make such achievements in five years. Berkarya's organizational wing, Laskar Berkarya, demanded that Tommy Suharto immediately dismiss Muchdi from the party, describing his endorsement of Jokowi as an act of betrayal. The reformist Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), which supports Jokowi, questioned whether Muchdi was seeking to act as \\"a destructive Trojan horse from within\\" or merely looking to create a sensation. PSI official Surya Tjandra said Muchdi's support would not increase Jokowi's electability. Muchdi's Berkarya faction, called the Presidium of Party Rescuers, on 11 July 2020 held an Extraordinary National Conference (Munaslub), which named Muchdi as chairman of Berkarya. Tommy's faction rejected the Munaslub and said Muchdi and his followers had been dismissed from the party. The Justice and Human Rights Ministry on 30 July 2020 issued decrees recognizing Muchdi's changes to the party's leadership structure. ==Business activities== Muchdi is commissioner of Suryatama Cemerlang Abadi (SCA), a company that produces bottled water branded as Suli 5. The company has at least nine factories in Indonesia and is majority-owned by Muhammadiyah. Muchdi is the commissioner of PT. Rizki Kacida Reana, a forestry firm that was founded in 2000 and operates a concession of 55,150 hectares in East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan. Muchdi was in 2014-15 involved in a legal dispute with PT Internasional Islamic Boarding School over the ownership of company shares worth Rp10 billion. In May 2015, Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti ‘Tutut’ Rukmana appointed Muchdi as chief commissioner of her television network PT Citra Televisi Pendidikan Indonesia (TPI), which was embroiled in an ownership dispute with tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo. In December 2016, Muchdi was present for the inauguration of two associations that planned to resume sand mining and exports from Riau Islands province. The government had banned sand exports in 2007 because of environmental concerns, but the associations said exports of abundant sea sand would benefit the public. ==Other activities== * Harley Davison Club Indonesia: Muchdi is a prominent member of the Harley Davidson Club Indonesia (HDCI). His son Raditya Muhas shares his passion for motorbikes and is a founder of the Brawijaya Riders motorcycle community. * Indonesian Pencak Silat Association: From 2007 to 2011, Muchdi was daily chairman of the Executive Board of the Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI), the official body of the traditional martial art. In 2009, Muchdi was highly critical of the inauguration ceremony for the regional board of IPSI in Batam, Riau Islands province. He said the room was too large, the stage too high, and there were no performers able to recite the Quran. * Tapak Suci: Muchdi is chairman of the Central Leadership of Tapak Suci Putera Muhammadiyah, a self- defense martial art organization of the Muhammadiyah Muslim group. In 2008, when on trial for soliciting the murder of Munir, Muchdi told the court, “I am a great warrior of Tapak Suci, a warrior who can fight alone, especially to face one person.” Among his supporters cheering him at the trial were members of Tapak Suci. * ASGA Indonesia: Muchdi is president of the Asian Senior Golf Association - Indonesia. * Muhammadiyah scouts: Muchdi is chairman of the Central Headquarters of the Muhammadiyah Scouting Movement Hizbul Wathan for the 2016-21 period. He said he would focus on using the Hizbul Wathan scouts to fight against the circulation of illegal drugs. ==Personal life== Muchdi is married to Puji Astuti and they have three children: Dewi Kirana Juvirawati, Raditya Muhas Juvirawan and Dias Baskara Dewantara. In November 2014, Dias married Allida Alexandra ‘Andra’ Nurluthvia, the third daughter of racing driver Alex Asmasoebrata. Their wedding reception at Jakarta's Shangri-La Hotel reportedly cost Rp5 billion. Alex said he was proud to be connected to Muchdi because he considers him a true patriot who is reputed to have assisted orphans and Islamic boarding schools. He said he hoped the wedding would bring Andra closer to God and result in her wearing a Muslim headscarf. Andra and Dias were divorced by 2017, and Andra married a nephew of Vice President Jusuf Kalla in January 2018. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Yogyakarta Category:Indonesian generals Category:Indonesian National Military Academy alumni Category:Javanese people Category:Indonesian Muslims ","title":"Muchdi Purwopranjono"},{"id":"56675808","text":"Vulcanibacillus is a genus of bacteria from the family of Bacillaceae with one known species (Vulcanibacillus modesticaldus).

From an early age István was very good at drawing, and at the age of 14 he began his studies at Art College, which started his professional career. Teachers immediately took notice of his extraordinary personality and qualities of a leader and maximalist. In 1986 István began actively participating in regional, national and international exhibitions, and with his like-minded friends he organized a sensational imaginative association which they called \\"Left Eye.\\" Their exhibitions were a success and a great interest. This same group later organized a rock band, \\"St. Pauli Guys,\\" that was the start of a full-fledged creative, carefree. Of 1988 he took a job in the theater as a graphic designer, and began drawing again. In the works of István Molnár, 1988–1989 was probably the most productive period of his life. During this time he created more than two dozen works that experts and critics associate to the Light period. In autumn 1989, István went to study at the Lviv Art Academy and rose to a whole new level in his development. The city of Lviv was the artistic center of Western Ukraine and the cradle of national traditions. The centuries-old history of Galicia was associated with the Russian Empire, Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and in it many cultures were interwoven. At the Lviv Art Academy, István finally decided on the art direction to take, and it was expressionism. Still, the academy staff did not support Molnár in his choice and even complicated his life as they were able, but he was steadfast in his choice. He studied and practiced by drawing pictures in the style of European and world classics of the early twentieth century, often experimenting. He ended up falling in love with the outstanding work of Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele, engrossed once again, and this time for good. The creative association \\"Left Eye\\" was still developing. István and the others held exhibitions in Uzhhorod and Budapest, followed by collective exhibitions at the Lviv National Museum, Rzeszów, Budapest, Berlin, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Madison. In the US, two of István's works were exhibited: \\"Wolf-cub\\" (1990) and \\"Cats\\" (1991). István did not part with his guitar even in the student dormitory. The music world of U2 walked beside him throughout his life and helped him reach new heights in creativity. The works of Egon Schiele influenced him on the deepest level and in 1992 a series of works were created, which Molnár's contemporaries have yet to fully appreciate. It is important to remember that István was an exchange student. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Budapest one of the teachers encouraged his students to \\"learn drawing from this guy.\\" Many students took advantage of opportunity to stay in Budapest. In the end, István decided to return to Lviv and 1993, the last year of his life, was marked by a new series of paintings: \\"Totem 1,\\" \\"Totem 2,\\" \\"Totem 3\\" and \\"Snail.\\" A few days before his passing, he painted his \\"tree of pain and bitterness\\". István Molnár died on June 21, 1993 in Uzhhorod. The artistic heritage of István Molnár is disappointingly little. He drew no more than 60 paintings, which were sold to all corners of the world. But his exhibitions are still shown, from time to time there are publications, and TV programs about him have been aired. There is an interest in, and a need for his paintings. == References == == External links == * István Molnár – Messenger of Eternity * Arcképcsarnok – Művészek: Molnár István * YouTube- videó: Molnár István * Magyar művészet Kárpátalján (Molnár István – 299. old.) * Посланник вечности Иштван Молнар * In memoriam Иштвана Молнара: в Ужгороде открыли ретроспективную выставку самобытного художника * Тот, Кто Спешил Жить.

In addition to her artworks and installations, since the early 1990s she has decorated a number of Danish buildings including Copenhagen University's South Campus on Amager. In 2002, she was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and in 2015, she received the prestigious Thorvaldsen Medal. ==Biography== The daughter of a Slovak mother and a Greek father, Collaro was born in Bratislava, then part of Czechoslovakia, on 30 June 1946. She studied at the University of Michigan and at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Working in the United States in the 1960s, she came under the influence of minimalism, pop art and concept art. In particular, she was inspired by the artists Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg while her adoption of neon lighting as an art form was based on the work of Dan Flavin. Her familiarization with Danish culture has stemmed in part from her membership since 1991 of the art groups Ny Abstraktion and Grønningen. Collaro was fascinated by the thriving activity in the city of Copenhagen with all its lights and reflections. The extent to which they influenced her work can be seen in her creations which frequently combine painting, three-dimensional objects and fluorescent tubes. Geometrical figures are also a feature of her work, used either systematically or intuitively. Her 1000 farver (1000 Colours), created in 1979 in collaboration with Niels Nedergaard, has been exhibited in the National Gallery of Denmark's permanent exhibition (2015–16). Collaro is considered a pioneer in the integration of light art and architecture. One of her earlier architectural works is Ringen (the Ring, 1998) on the façade of Kulturhuset (The House of Culture) in Randers. Among her later architectural achievements are light art applications in Aarhus University (2000), Avedøre Kraftværk 2 (2001), the University of Copenhagen (2003), the Technical University of Denmark (2004), Plejecentret Violskrænten, Grenå (2012), and the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, Søborg (2013). Art museums throughout Denmark have hosted her solo exhibitions. ==References== ==External links== *Viera Collaro's CV Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Danish artists Category:Danish women artists Category:Slovak artists Category:Slovak women artists Category:Slovak people of Greek descent Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:People from Bratislava Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni ","title":"Viera Collaro"},{"id":"56675997","text":"Knockanure is a village in County Kerry, Ireland, and is located near the town of Listowel and the village of Moyvane. == Amenities == Knockanure has one church, The Church Of Corpus Christi, which was built in 1964.

The Resii traced their ancestry to Fertor Resius, King of the Aequicoli, in the time of the Roman monarchy. However, few members of this gens are mentioned in history. ==Origin== According to tradition, Fertor Resius was King of the Aequicoli, an Oscan-speaking people better known as the Aequi, a confederation of hill tribes whom together with the Volsci came into regular conflict with the nascent Roman Republic during the fifth century BC. An Old Latin inscription discovered on the Palatine Hill records that Resius taught the Roman people the ius fetiale, the law prescribing the manner in which an ambassador should approach another people to demand redress for various grievances, or deliver a formal declaration of war:. > Fert[o]r Resius, Rex Aequicolus, is preimus ius fetiale paravit inde > p(opulus) R(omanus) discipleinam excepit. > Fertor Resius, King of the Aequicoli, first instituted the ius fetiale. From > him the Roman people acquired the discipline. Livy describes this procedure as it was first adopted by Ancus Marcius, the fourth King of Rome, in the latter part of the seventh century BC, and reports that the ius fetiale was adopted from the Aequicoli, although he does not name Resius.Livy, i. 32. Dionysius discusses the institution of the fetiales and the ius fetiale under Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, and mentions the tradition that the law originated with the Aequicolae, together with an alternative tradition, mentioned by the historian Gnaeus Gellius, attributing the ius fetiale to the people of Ardea, but like Livy he does not name their king.Dionysius, ii. 72.Livy, i. 24.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, pp. 530, 531 (\\"Fetiales\\").Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquity, pp. 667, 668 (\\"Fetiales\\"). ==Praenomina== The legendary Fertor Resius bore an otherwise unknown praenomen, which some scholars have amended to Sertor, a known but archaic name; but the current consensus is that Fertor is a separate name. The Resii of historical times bear more conventional praenomina, of which the most frequent appear to have been Titus and Aulus. Other names used by the Resii include Gaius, Manius, and Marcus. ==Branches and cognomina== There is no evidence that the Resii were ever divided into distinct families, and all of their surnames have the appearance of personal cognomina, such as Asper, rough, Aster, a star, Genialis, genial, and Severus, stern.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. asper, aster, genialis, severus. Albanus would probably belong to a class of surnames derived from the town of the bearer's origin, perhaps indicating that his family had lived in the Alban Hills.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Patruus, the surname of one of the Resii from Vicentia in Venetia and Histria, referred to a paternal uncle, and probably served to distinguish him from his nephew and namesake.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. patruus. A number of other surnames borne by freedmen would have been their original personal names, prior to their manumission. Several women of this gens bore surnames derived from old praenomina, which served the same individualizing function, although placed after the gentilicium, such as Gaia, the feminine of Gaius; Paula, little; Prima, a name given to the eldest daughter in a family; and Rufa, red-haired.Chase, The Origin of Roman Praenomina, pp. 165, 166, 171, 175, 176.Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina. Victoria presumably refers to the goddess of the same name. ==Members== * Fertor Resius, King of the Aequicoli in the time of the Roman monarchy, to whom the institution of the ius fetiale was ascribed. * Titus Resius T. f., governor of an uncertain province between 50 and 20 BC, built a sepulchre at Mevania in Umbria..PIR, vol.

W. B. Joseph, was a British philosopher, who spent his academic career as a Fellow and Tutor at New College, Oxford. == Biography == === Early life === Horace William Brindley Joseph was born at Chatham, Kent, on 28 September 1867, the eldest surviving son of Alexander Joseph (died 1890), rector of St John's, Chatham, and Honorary Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and his wife, Janet Eleanor née Acworth (died 1917), daughter of George Acworth, a solicitor, and cousin of Sir William Acworth. Joseph attended Allhallows School in Honiton (1877–80) and then Winchester College as a scholar (1880–86; he went on to win three gold medals there and was a prefect). In 1886 he went up to New College, Oxford, as a scholar and graduated with a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores (classics) in 1890, winning the Junior Greek Testament Prize in 1889 and the Arnold Historical Essay Prize in 1891, the same year he was elected a Fellow of New College and appointed a lecturer in Philosophy.Clement C.

Retrieved 24 February 2018. === Career === Joseph was appointed a Tutor at New College in 1892 and, when Alfred Robinson died in 1895, he became New College's Senior Philosophy Tutor (he remained in the position until 1932) and Junior Bursar (until 1919). He was also the University of Oxford's Senior Proctor for the 1906–07 academic and Public Examiner for Literae Humaniores from 1910 to 1912 and again from 1921 to 1922.\\"Joseph, Horace William Brindley\\", Who Was Who (online edition; Oxford University Press, December 2007). Retrieved 24 February 2018. His philosophy was \\"firmly rooted\\" in Plato and Aristotle's and he was the University of Oxford's foremost lecturer on Plato's Republic; nevertheless, in his career he took greatest satisfaction out of his role as a tutor. His first book was An Introduction to Logic (1906; 2nd edition, 1916), and this was followed by The Labour Theory of Value in Karl Marx (1923) and Some Problems in Ethics (1931); in 1930, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). He retired in 1932, when he became a Supernumerary Fellow at New College; he published a collection of his essays, mostly earlier ones, as Essays in Ancient and Modern Philosophy (1935), including his Herbert Spencer Lecture \\"The concept of evolution\\" (1924), which Clement C. J. Webb and C. A. Creffield in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography consider \\"perhaps the most important of his philosophical writings\\". Another work, Knowledge and the Good in Plato's Republic, was published in 1948, after Joseph had died, and across his career he had published several important articles in Mind; the journal carried an obituary of him when he died.H. A. Pritchard, \\"H. W. B. Joseph, 1867–1943\\", Mind, vol. 53, no. 210 (1944), pp. 189–191. Retrieved 24 February 2018. In retirement, Joseph continued to teach at New College and also served as a member of Oxford City Council and Chairman of its Education Committee. He lived in College during term, but stayed with his mother during vacations at Holford and then from 1912 at Dinder. In 1919 he married Margaret (died 1926), a daughter of Robert Bridges, but there were no children of their happy union. He established a music scholarship in her memory at his college and, after he died in the Acland Home, Oxford, on 13 November 1943, New College erected a memorial tablet to Joseph and his wife in its cloisters. == Philosophy == According to Clement C.

The DCT was built by the Dubai shipping company DP World in 2006 after securing a 30-year contract by the government of Djibouti, and opened in 2009. In February 2018, following a dispute between the government of Djibouti and the Dubai-based shipping firm DP World, the government seized 33% of DP World stake and nationalized the terminal. The move was ruled as illegal multiple times by the UK's high courts as it have breached the contact in 2006. After seizing the port from DP World, Dijbouti government sold China Merchants Ports Holdings a quarter of the port's stake. ==Construction and capacity== The DCT was built in 2009 by the Dubai shipping company DP World after securing a 30-year contract by Djibouti in 2006. The contract was one of a number of others won by DP World in the region, including one in Berbera, Somaliland. The DCT's quay is 1050 meters with 18 meters depth, and can hold 1.25 million TEU. The facility also operates eight Super-post-Panamax container cranes. An ENOC petroeum terminal is located adjacent to the DCT. The terminal is the largest employer in Djibouti and its largest source of revenue. As of 2015, the DCT was described as the most technologically advanced container terminal on the African continent. ==Shipping activity== The port is called by major shipping services in the region, including: * OCEAN Alliance Red Sea Express 2 * Maersk Line Horn of Africa * Maersk Line MECL * MSC Australia Express * CMA CGM and Hapag- Lloyd EPIC1/IPAK * CMA CGM Mona Express * CMA CGM and Emirates Swahili Express * CMA CGM and COSCO India Middle East Mediterranean Express * PIL Red Sea Gulf Service * COSCO and Yang Ming Red Sea Express ==Djibouti-DP World conflict== In 2014 the Djibouti government accused DP World of bribing the port authority Abdourahman Boreh, and stated the operating contract was unfair. A London commercial court cleared Boreh of misconduct in 2016. In November 2017, Djibouti passed legislation allowing it to renegotiate contracts related to strategic infrastructure. In February 2018, on the order of president Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, the Djibouti government seized the facility and placed it under the control of the government-owned Doraleh Container Terminal Management Company. The government stated that the DP World contract violated Djibouti's sovereignty. In response, DP world began a new arbitration case in London against the termination of their 30 year contract to manage the port to secure \\"compensation for their breach or expropriation.\\" The Djibouti government stated it would engage in \\"normal compensation procedures\\" to pay for the nationalization. The nationalization has occurred as the United Arab Emirates has expanded its influence, included through military bases, around the Red Sea and East Africa. At the intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and located next to the Bab el-Mandeb strait, Djibouti occupies a strategic position, and hosts US, Chinese, French and Italian military bases. Al-Jazeera has reported that according to its sources, relations between the UAE-based company and Djibouti were strained after Djibouti denied the UAE permission to build a military base on its territory. In 2017, a tribunal at the London Court of International Arbitration ruled against the Djibouti government claim that DP World's agreement was unfair, and ordered the government to pay DP World damages. The London court was led by English jurists Lord Leonard Hoffman and Sir Richard Aikens. In 2018 the London High Court prohibited Djibouti government's port company from interfering with the management of DCT. As per the ruling, the Djibouti government \\"shall not act as if the joint venture agreement with DP World has been terminated\\". As of January 2020, six legal rulings by London courts were won by DP World, with a ruling in January 2020 asking the Djbouti government to pay $533 million in compensation to DP World. An independent analysis has estimated DP World losses to be more than $1 billion. According to DP World, all rulings have been ignored by Djibouti despite the original contract for the concession was written and governed by English law. After seizing the port from DP World, Dijbouti government offered China Merchants Ports Holdings a quarter of the port's stake. When the deal with DP world fell apart, DP World moved to invest in the port of Berbera, while Ethiopia, who depended on the Doraleh Container Terminal for 95% of its imports, acquired 19% stake in the port of Berbera. ==See also== * Port of Berbera ==References== Category:Container terminals Category:Ports and harbours of Djibouti Category:Ports and harbours of the Arab League Category:Transport in the Arab League ","title":"Doraleh Container Terminal"},{"id":"56676324","text":"Aviapark () is a six-story shopping center in the Khoroshyovsky District of Moscow, Russia.

The only major shareholder is Mikhail Zaits. In 2017, media reports suggested that Gazprombank was, at one point, involved in the mall’s ownership. The bank initially provided a $560 million construction loan on the mall. Kommersant reported that, as part of a restructuring, Aviapark Mall Holdings received an option to buy the remaining stake from Gazprombank, which it exercised, removing the bank from the ownership structure. It received its GPZU, or approved development plan, in June 2012 and began construction later that year. The opening was projected for the fourth quarter of 2014.

He was also the grandson of Edward King, 1st Earl of Kingston, and cousin of Robert King, 6th Earl of Kingston. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge where he achieved an MA before, in 1825, joining the army and serving as an officer of the 14th Light Dragoons until 1836. Having retired from the army, he then served as a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff for County Leitrim, County Roscommon and County Sligo, and later became a Lord Lieutenant for Roscommon and Sligo. In 1838, he married travel writer and artist Lady Louisa Mary Anne Anson, daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield and Louisa Catherine Philips. Together, they had two children: Louisa Frances Mary (died 1868) and Florence Margaret Christine Tenison (1845–1907). ==Photography== In the 1840s, he took up photography, beginning with daguerreotypes and paper negatives, after receiving a licence granted by former Chippenham MP William Henry Fox Talbot. Córdoba in Spain, taken in 1852 Between 1850 and 1852, King Tenison and his wife travelled in Spain for their artwork where, as an early adopter of the calotype photographic process, he aroused suspicion and curiosity due to his bulky equipment and outdoor work. The work was later published as Memories of Spain in 1854, while his wife's 50 lithographs appeared in Castile and Anadalucia in 1853. In 1853, he joined the Photographic Society of London, and first displayed his work at the Great Industrial Exhibition in Dublin. The next year, he then helped to found the Dublin Photographic Society. Further works of his were later put on display in London between 1854 and 1855, encompassing photos taken using calotype and waxed paper processes in Spain, Belgium and Normandy. He then travelled to Algeria, before concluding his career taking photos in his home nation of Ireland. An album of his work, calotypes and salt print photos of Ireland taken in 1858, is now preserved in the National Photographic Archive in Dublin, while further work is held in private collections. In 1999, one album was sold at Christie's for more than $10,000. ==Political career== King Tenison first stood for election in 1830 at Roscommon but was unsuccessful. He was later elected MP for Leitrim in 1847 – standing on civil and religious liberty, opposing anti-Catholic measures – but stood down at the next general election in 1852. King Tenison sought to be MP for the seat again in 1857 as well as in 1859 for Roscommon, but was both times unsuccessful. He also stood at a by-election in Sligo Borough in 1860, but retired from the race after refusing to offer bribes to Liberal electors. His final attempt for parliament in 1865, at Leitrim, was also unsuccessful. ==Death== King Tenison died at Kilronan Castle in June 1878, while his wife died at Trieste, Italy in September 1882. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1805 births Category:1878 deaths Category:Irish photographers Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Leitrim constituencies (1801–1922) Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Politicians from County Roscommon Category:UK MPs 1847–1852 Category:Whig (British political party) MPs for Irish constituencies ","title":"Edward King-Tenison"},{"id":"56676355","text":"Jahromi () is an Iranian surname.

The boycott and social media activism campaign arose in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The NRA was criticized for its response, including its recommendation for schools to arm teachers and opposition to bans on certain assault weapons. Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA resulted in several companies discontinuing their business relationships with the NRA and cancelling discount programs offered to NRA members. The boycott extended to Canada where Mountain Equipment Co-op and the Running Room cut supplier relationships with Vista Outdoor.Public pressure also caused a number of gun retailers to increase the age required to buy firearms and place other restrictions on gun sales. ==Background== After the Parkland shooting, there was an unprecedented upsurge of public support for gun control advocacy groups and significant backlash against the NRA for its response to the shooting, having argued that schools required more armed security to protect against the possibility of future attacks, and its continued calls to preserving the right to own semi-automatic firearms, such as those used in the shooting. On February 20, 2018, ThinkProgress asked over two dozen corporations offering discounts to NRA members whether they would continue their relationships with the NRA. Several companies terminated their agreements with the NRA, and their announcements went viral, along with hashtags such as #BoycottNRA, started by activists like Michael Skolnik. One of the first to respond to the boycott, First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States, announced that it will not renew its deal for the “official credit card of the NRA.” ==Companies involved== ===Affinity marketing=== One class of companies targeted generally offer or offered discounts or free trials to NRA members, often advertised on the NRA website, in what is often termed affinity marketing. Access to discounts is a benefit of paying NRA membership dues and the NRA promotes the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars more than the cost of membership. ====Severed ties==== Companies that have severed ties with the NRA as of February 24, 2018, span banks, airlines, car rental services, hotels, and software companies. They include: * Avis Budget Group (Avis, Budget and Hertz) * Allied Van Lines and North American Van Lines both owned by Sirva * Best Western * Delta Air Lines * Enterprise Holdings (Enterprise, National and Alamo) * First National Bank of Omaha * Harland Clarke Direct Selling Solutions * Paramount Rx * Personify Corp * Republic Bank & Trust Company * Securian * SimpliSafe * Starkey Hearing Technologies * Symantec * Teladoc * TrueCar * United Airlines * Wyndham Hotel Group (in 2012 after Sandy Hook) but reiterated it does not support the NRA * Yeti ====Retained ties==== Several companies have been pressured to disaffiliate with the NRA, but have not, or have not issued statements indicating that they will. * Bass Pro Shops and subsidiary Cabela's * BlackRock, saying that it would speak with weapons manufacturers and distributors, but has not taken any further action yet. * Clearent credit card processing * Global Rescue * HotelPlanner defended its relationship with the NRA * Life Line Screening * Lloyds of London * Long-Term Care Resources * ManageUrID * Medical Concierge Network * MedFlight Freedom * MidwayUSA, saying \\"no company in America is more dedicated to, and more supportive of, the goals of the National Rifle Association than MidwayUSA\\" * ReliaStar * NetSpend * Omni Hotels * Vinesse Wine Clubs, the official wine club of the NRA * Wells Fargo ====FedEx==== Protesters outside the FedEx Office in Midtown Manhattan Pressure on FedEx to drop NRA discounts of up to 26 percent had been going on for nearly a year before the Florida shooting. After several companies cut ties with the NRA, calls to boycott FedEx arose on social media under the hashtag #BoycottFedEx. In a statement, FedEx affirmed that while it does not fully agree with the NRA on issues of gun policy, it will continue its business relationship with the organization.https://www.commercialappeal.com/amp/372882002 Due to a drop in NRA related volume that made the organization ineligible for discounts, the NRA was dropped from the program on October 30, 2018. ===Insurance providers=== In response to the NRA boycott several companies discontinued insurance products targeted at NRA members. * Lockton Companies announced it would no longer sell NRA endorsed policies. * Chubb Limited ended its insurance product called NRA Carry Guard which covered gun owners who shot someone and claimed self-defence. * MetLife ended discounts for NRA members. ===Vista Outdoor=== Vista Outdoor manufactures AR-15-style rifles under the Savage Arms brand and ammunition under the CCI and Federal brands as well as a range of bike related and other outdoor products including the Bell, Giro, CamelBak, and Blackburn brands. After the Parkland shooting, consumers called on retailers to stop selling all Vista Outdoor products specifically over the company's support of the NRA. Bicycle retailers in several states stopped selling all Vista Outdoor products, citing the company's support for the NRA. Some cancelled orders or returned existing stock. Canadian retail cooperative Mountain Equipment Co-op similarly announced on March 1, 2018 that, in response to a petition by its members, it would no longer stock products by Vista Outdoor brands in its 22 stores. The co-op does not sell guns. In the United States Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI) announced that they would stop ordering all Vista Outdoor products due to the company's NRA support. Running Room, Canada's largest dealer of athletic apparel announced it will discontinue Camelbak products across the chain of 120 Canadian and two US stores, citing strong customer support for the move. ===Broadcasters of NRA programming=== NRATV, the NRA's online video channel, is a prominent forum used by the organization to disseminate its message and with a large follower base on social media. In the aftermath of the events in Parkland, activists created the hashtags #stopNRAmazon and #DumpNRATV asking Amazon to discontinue streaming programs from NRATV, an initiative supported by celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Denis O’Hare, Evan Handler, Ben Gleib, Joshua Malina, Warren Leight, Genevieve Angelson, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, and Misha Collins. Other companies offering NRATV programs as part of their streaming services became the target of a similar campaign launched by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense and Everytown for Gun Safety. The following companies continue to stream NRATV, despite petitions for them to stop: * Amazon with Amazon Fire TV * Apple Inc. with Apple TV * Google with Chromecast * Roku, Inc., which streams NRATV and NRA Women, stated it operates an open streaming service and that clients decide which channels they download. * SiriusXM, which hosts an NRA radio show has also been pressured to cut ties.https://channelstore.roku.com/details/43100/nra-women ===Gun dealers=== On February 28, 2018 Dick's Sporting Goods discontinued the sale of all assault-style rifles, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. The company also immediately restricted the sale of any guns to customers aged 21 or older. As justification for the move, Dick's praised the Stoneman Douglas students who are campaigning for gun control and for businesses to side against the NRA. They also noted that Dick's had legally sold a shotgun (not used in the assault) to the Parkland shooter. Dick's also launched a corporate campaign for officials “to enact common sense gun reform” including regulations to require universal background checks, raise the age to purchase guns to 21, and ban the firearms and accessories that Dick's no longer sells. Since Dick's is a large gun dealer their moves were cited as \\"one of the biggest steps taken by a US company\\" after the Parkland shooting energized the gun control debate. Citing \\"recent events\\" on February 28, 2018 Walmart announced it would raise the required age to buy all guns and ammo to 21 and require background checks on all purchasers. Walmart also stopped all sales of air rifles and toys that look like assault rifles on its website and called for tougher gun control measures. Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic assault rifles in 2015, and has been reducing the number of stores that sell guns for some years. It does not sell handguns (except in Alaska) and it does not sell bump stocks or high capacity magazines. On March 1, 2018, US grocery chain Kroger announced it would stop selling guns and ammunition to people under 21 at 45 of its Fred Meyer locations. Their grocery stores do not sell firearms, but did sell a variety of gun periodicals until March 16, 2018, when Kroger announced it would no longer sell gun periodicals that included content about assault-style rifles. L.L.Bean also announced it would end sales of guns to anyone under 21 years old. In response, several lawsuits were filed against Dick's and Walmart claiming age discrimination. In the wake of boycott, Dick's first quarter net income increased to $60.1 million compared to $58.2 million for the same quarter the previous year, and sales were up by 4.6%. The results suggest that threats of a boycott against Dick's have not had the intended effect and that the company's policy change has had a positive business impact. This trend reversed in the second quarter. The decline was blamed in part on new firearms sales policies adopted after the Parkland, FL school shooting. ==Publix== National grocery retailer Publix suspended all political donations after Stoneman Douglas survivor David Hogg organized a \\"die in\\" and a public boycott to protest the company's support of Adam Putnam, an NRA- backed candidate for Florida governor. The NRA had labeled Putnam with its highest endorsement and Putnam called himself on Twitter a \\"proud NRA sellout.\\" Hogg stated \\"Anyone who supports an NRA sellout is an NRA sellout,\\" as the reason for the action.http://www.kimt.com/content/national/483763971.html Prior to the in store protests Hogg called on Publix to donate $1 million to the Stoneman Douglas Victims fund. ==Response== In a statement released February 24, 2018, the NRA accused the companies involved in the boycott of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and added, “Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.” Following the NRA's response, conservative commentators and gun rights supporters voiced opposition to the boycott, calling it \\"mob justice\\" and accusing supporters of silencing free speech. Tim Hentschel of HotelPlanner.com said he would not mix business and politics, and that his decision to maintain the company's relationship with the NRA was not based on money. Republicans in the Georgia state Senate voted to remove $50 million in jet fuel tax sale exemptions from a tax bill in response to Delta Air Lines' decision to sever ties with the NRA. Republican Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle tweeted \\"I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian responded, saying, \\"Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale.\\" ==See also== * 2018 United States gun violence protests * Boycott of The Ingraham Angle * Sleeping Giants ==References== ==External links== * #BoycottNRA and #stopNRAmazon on Twitter.

Commercial, Herne Hill, SE24 (2506724746) The Commercial (also known as The Commercial Hotel) is a public house at 210-212 Railton Road, Herne Hill, London. It is cited in 'The CAMRA Regional Inventory for London' as being one of only 133 pubs in Greater London with a pub interior of special historic interest, most notably for its, \\"Original counters, bar-back, fireplaces and much fielded wall panelling\\" dating from the 1930s. In July 2016, Lambeth Council designated The Commercial as a locally-listed heritage asset of architectural or historic interest, being described as a, \\"Two-storey Neo Georgian style inter-war pub with a three-part convex façade which follows the curve of the building line\\". ==History== The history of The Commercial dates from development of the area around Herne Hill railway station, which opened in 1862. The 1870 Ordnance Survey Map shows a cluster of new commercial development around the front of the railway station captioned ‘Commercial Place’, although the first direct reference to 'The Commercial Hotel' as licensed premises dates to 1876. An \\"Important Notice\\" in the South London Chronicle on 6 September 1876 states that, \\"F. Mole, Family Wine and Spirit Merchant, Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill Station, Dulwich Begs inform Commercial Travellers and the public generally that he has the Choicest Selection wines and spirits, bottled ales and stout\\". There is no record of The Commercial ever operating as an actual 'hotel', so it seems likely that this was added to give the pub status. On 28 February 1880, the South London Press reports a court summons for disgraceful conduct for James Early, who acted in a disorderly manner and refused to leave The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, when requested to do so by Mr. Sparrowhawk, the manager. The 1881 Census records five people residing at The Commercial - the licensed victualler, Elizabeth Davies, the manager, John Sparrowhawk, and a barmaid, general servant, and potman. The Post Office Directory lists the publicans of The Commercial Hotel variously as Mrs. E. Davies in 1878, W. Cobley in 1896, Samuel Shott Death in 1904, and Clarke, Baker and Co. Ltd in 1944. The 1881 Census also shows William Cobley as running the Ship York Tavern in Rotherhithe, but by the time of the 1891 Census, he is shown as living with his wife Sarah at The Commercial. The Proceedings of the Old Bailey show William Cobley of The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, and his son Earnest William Cobley, giving evidence concerning a burglary at the pub by Robert Williams and John Tucker on 13 November 1893. The scene is described by Earnest, \\"On 17th October I went to bed about 12.45, after fastening up the house in con—junction with my dad—I came down about 7.40 a.m., and found the place in disorder, and a glass had been used for port wine — I saw the prisoners in the bar the night before\\". Both defendants were found guilty and sentenced to hard labour. A report of the local Conservative Ball in February 1889, states that members and their friends afterwards dined at The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, hosted by Cobley. The rural environs of pub in the latter part of the 19th Century, are indicated by a Sporting Life report in March 1889 of The Surrey Fox Terrier and Rabbit Coursing Club adjourning to The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, \\"where the stakes were paid over, and with musical evening\\". A case of counterfeit coinage is reported in September 1908 concerning Joseph Coombs, general dealer, who in company with his friend Boon, entered The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, where Boon put down a bad florin payment for drinks, which was immediately recognised by David Torr, a barman at the house, as counterfeit. A 1912 photograph from the Lambeth Council Archives shows the name 'W. Colmer' displayed above the entrance to The Commercial Hotel, and a sign proclaiming \\"Bass on draught and in bottles\\". At the Lambeth Police Court on 19 December 1918, William Colmer, licensee of the Commercial Hotel, was summoned for refusing to sell certain whisky to a person duly authorised by the Lambeth Food Control Committee. On a second summons the defendant was proceeded against for serving whisky without having a label on the bottle from which it was served, stating the strength and maximum price. A 1921 photograph taken looking down Railton Road, with Herne Hill railway station on the right, shows a large sign advertising bottled Worthington beer on the side of The Commercial pub. In 1936, the pub is shown in the Burton upon Trent Bass Museum archive, as being a Licensed House of Wenlock Brewery Co. Ltd of Shoreditch. The current frontage and historic interior of the pub dates from its enlargement in 1938 to incorporate number 210 Railton Road. The Commercial is one of at least 5,000 pubs which were built or rebuilt by breweries in England during the inter-war years. For a number of years in the 1970s and 1980s, The Commercial was noteworthy for its association with London Welsh RFC, who met in the pub, and the lounge bar was filled with at least 70 framed rugby shirts, ties and photos donated by leading London Welsh players, including Welsh international and TV commentator, John Taylor. Photograph taken inside The Commercial pub in Herne Hill in March 2018, showing the historic 1930s interior saloon bar, bar counter and chequered gutter. The saloon and public bar of the pub were joined together in 2005. Whilst parts of the 1930s fielded wood panelling have been unsympathetically painted, the pub retains its fireplaces, bar-back (extending to the ceiling), bar and counter with round corner, and a rare example of a black and white chequered gutter ('spittoon trough') in the saloon. The Commercial continues to be a fine London example of an improved inter-war pub (rebuilt by breweries to increase size and appeal more to families and particularly women), of which increasingly few remain. The pub front is faience (now painted), which is also typical of the period. A blocked external doorway between the two sides of the pub may indicate a former off sales. ==The Commercial in popular culture== The Commercial in Herne Hill is cited as an influence by author John Ashton for his 2007 novel 'Dinner with Mandelson'. In the 2018 book 'Today South London, Tomorrow South London', The Commercial is visited by the protagonists Dulwich Raider, Dirty South, Half-Life, and Cousin Max, where they sit outside and \\"survey the piazza\\". ==Recent history== The Commercial was named as South East London CAMRA 'Pub of the Season' in winter 2008/09. The pub also holds the Cask Marque Award for serving great quality real ale. It also runs a popular Monday evening quiz night. The Commercial closed for a major refurbishment in February 2017, officially dropping the word 'Hotel' from its name when reopening a few weeks later. It is currently owned by Mitchells and Butlers, and includes a small beer garden at the back. It is listed by Mitchells and Butlers as one of its 'Castle' brand pubs, \\"decidedly individual, with a character to suit its community\\". The Commercial is also included in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide 2018. The Commercial pub also features in a print celebrating Herne Hill's historic pubs, displayed on lamppost banners in the local area. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Pubs in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:National Inventory Pubs Category:Herne Hill ","title":"The Commercial, Herne Hill"},{"id":"56676646","text":"The 1988 Big Eight Men's Basketball Tournament was held March 10–12 at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri.

B. Abercrombie, was a British writer. ==Biography== Patricia Abercrombie was born on 20 July 1917 in Hambledon, Surrey. Her father, Charles Murray Abercrombie, was a stockbroker who was serving in the British Army on the Western Front at the time of her birth. Her father came from a large family and among her uncles were the writer Lascelles Abercrombie and the town planner Patrick Abercrombie. Her mother died when she was 15 and her father two years later. She learned shorthand and typing and, at the age on nineteen, moved to London, where she married Denis Charles Barnes, a civil servant, in 1938. He was also a industrial relations expert, and wrote books. Denis Barnes became the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour in 1966 and was knighted in 1967. He died on 6 May 1991. She died on 7 May 2003 in Tenterden. She and her husband are buried in Wittersham in Kent. ==Works== She began writing short stories on lunch breaks while working at the Ministry of Labour during World War Two. Her first novel, The Rescuers, was published in 1952. Reviewing it in the Daily Telegraph, John Betjeman wrote, \\"It abounds with subtle observation of psychological nuances, with illuminating remarks on human behaviour,\\" and Marghanita Laski said that \\"It is written with delicacy and intelligence.\\" Following the publication of her third novel, Victor and the Vanquished, Angus Wilson wrote that \\"Miss Abercrombie is, in my opinion, the most interesting of our young novelists.\\" Her most critically and commercially successful novel was A Little Difference, a comedy involving an adulterous teacher in an eccentric all-girls school. The Tatler's reviewer found it \\"As enjoyable as a glass of champagne in the middle of a sunny morning when you ought to be working.\\" Infidelity played a role in her fifth novel, Fido Couchant, about the comic but rocky progress of two marriages. Her sixth novel, Pity, centered on a child kidnapping. The Times' reviewer found that \\"Miss Abercrombie gets some good touches but her setting and style are not always convincing.\\" Her last book, The Brou Ha-Ha, was an epistolary novel and returned to a comic theme, but by the time of its publication in 1972, one writer had already asked, \\"Whatever happened to P. B. Abercrombie....?\\" She appears to have stopped writing after The Brou Ha-Ha. == Novels == * The Rescuers, 1952 * A Lease on Life, 1953 * Victor and the Vanquished, 1956 * The Child of Fortune, 1957 * A Little Difference, 1959 * Fido Couchant (published in the U.

Cinencuentro, February 19, 2018. A Greek and French coproduction, the film profiles Luana Muniz, a Brazilian transgender activist.\\"Berlin Int’l Film Festival offers politically charged queer narratives\\". The Hindu, February 24, 2018. ==Summary== Obscuro Barroco is an object that transforms infinitely, that devours infinitely: it is the mouth of Luana Muniz, a legendary figure of Rio de Janeiro’s night that serves as the stolen point of entry to the city's nocturnal incandescence. The film opens with a seductive ballet of luxuriant tropical vegetation caught in the sea breeze and bowing under heavy rain drops. The theatrical beauty of these evergreen trees is so intense that it appears to border upon the artificial: these images set the stage for a reversal of perspective in which nature itself seems factitious. It will reappear in the glittering décor of a carnival float, the swirling gateway to an artificial paradise that a healer blows in our face. It is our very capacity for metempsychosis that plays out in this film, this strange and unknown faculty through which our soul can move towards, through and inside other bodies. A true question of cinema, then. Obscuro Barroco is a docufiction about the dizzying heights of gender and metamorphosis. It is also a cinematographic hommage to a land of extremes, the city of Rio de Janeiro. Following the path of iconic transsexual figure Luana Muniz (1961-2017), the film explores different quests for the self through transvestism, carnaval and political struggle. In turn, it asks questions about the desire for transformation of the body, both intimate and social. The film had its theatrical premiere at the 2018 Berlin International Film Festival,\\"Brazilian Women Producers Make a Splash in Berlin\\". Variety, February 15, 2018. where it won a Jury Award from the Teddy Award program.\\"Berlin: 'Hard Paint' Wins Teddy Award for Best LGBTQ Feature\\".

The Gazu Hyakki Yagyō depicts a yōkai that looks like a monk wearing a tattered kasa standing next to a temple bell, but there is no explanation from Sekien about what this is about, so it is not known what characteristics this yōkai was intended to have. Beginning in the Shōwa period, literature about yōkai often explained that they are a yōkai that appear at deserted dilapidated temples or that they are resulting the grudges turned yōkai of a chief priest whose temple became dilapidated from lack of donations from villagers, which would then appear at evenings at the dilapidated temple and ring the bell alone at the deserted temple. ==Analysis== As it is not clear what Sekien drew here, starting from the Heisei period, several hypotheses have been put forth, and one of them supposes that this is an original creation from Sekien that was made to satirize the Edo Period monks who broke their precepts. In modern times, pictures and tales in a similar mold that depict priests who broke their precepts out of an attachment to greed and lust and thus became yōkai can be often be found, and examples of these can often be found in publications near Sekien's time. In the writings of the comic artist Mizuki Shigeru, there is a statement about the noderabō that when children would hear the sound of a bell in the mountains despite there being no temple, they were told that \\"it's because of the noderabō,\\" but actually it was because of the mountain, and a phenomenon like yamabiko had occurred. Also, in Niiza, Saitama Prefecture, there is a place called \\"Nodera,\\" and there was once a man who tried to menace the residents of a village, so he tried to steal a nearby famous bell when a traveler happened to pass by, in a panic, he hid himself at a pond, and as a result he lost sight of the bell. This lake came to be called the Kanegabuchi (鐘ヶ渕, \\"bell abyss\\"), and it is also said that once a young monk disregarded a task asked for by the chief priest and instead played with the children, and in gloom from feeling unable to meet face-to-face with the priest, went into the pond water, and ever since then, a cry from the pond can be heard every evening. It is also surmised that Sekien could have drawn this yōkai called noderabō based on the place names Nodera and Kanegabuchi. However, as for what exactly Sekien based this noderabō drawing on, considering the general tendency of all the yōkai included in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō and the meagerness of the information shown in the drawings, there is very little material that can serve as evidence for any conclusion. ==External links== * Noderabo at Yokai.com ==Notes== Category:Yōkai ","title":"Noderabō"},{"id":"56676675","text":"The list of shipwrecks in April 1833 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during April 1833. ==1 April== ==2 April== ==4 April== ==5 April== ==8 April== ==10 April== ==11 April== ==14 April== ===20 April=== ==21 April== ==22 April== ==24 April== ==25 April== ==26 April== ==29 April== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1833-04 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in April 1833"},{"id":"56676701","text":"Ermelinde Wertl was an Austrian international table tennis player.

It started airing on 26 February 2018 on Vijay TV in an afternoon programming block called \\"Vijay Matinee Thodargal\\". Mounika and Amruth who play the lead roles, are making their Tamil-language debuts with the series. The show is a family melodrama based on twin girls Nila and Diya (both played by Mounika Devi). It has ended on 22 June 2019. ==Synopsis== Nila and Diya (Mounika Devi) are identical twin sisters.

On her wedding day, she leaves a note for her father and leaves for Pondicherry to be with Vijay. Diya's father, Sathyamoorthy (Supergood Kannan), forces Diya to pretend to be Nila and marry Praveen for the sake of the family's reputation. After the wedding ceremony is over, Diya's boyfriend Aravind (Dharish) comes as a guest and discovers the twin switch.

Aravind is brainwashed by his sister in law, Kavitha, who is very greedy and believes that Diya has betrayed him for money and consequently plans to get revenge on her. Diya also discovers that Aravind took money from her parents to stay quiet about the twin switch so now she hates him too. During this time, Praveen constantly bothers Diya to accept him and claims to be in love with her even though he knows nothing about her, not even her real name. Diya eventually also falls in love with him. Diya understands Praveen's love for her and she accepts for the first night function where Diya and Praveen are supposed to consummate their marriage.

Kavitha, Aravind and Manimaaran, the union leader at Praveen's company, come up with a plan to scam the company. Aravind's brother Prabhakhar doesn't like their plan so he tries to expose the truth, but they keep him captive and eventually kill him. They also turn everyone in the family against Nila and she is kicked out of the house until Manasa-Aravind wedding is over. Diya wakes up from the coma and is very mad at Nila for her actions and wants Praveen back even though Praveen doesn't even recognize her as his real wife when she goes to meet him. Eventually Nila proves Kavitha, Aravind and Manimaaran were involved in murdering Prabhakhar, and Kavitha is arrested. Aravind goes to Praveen's house to tell the entire family the truth about the wedding day and twin switch before he also gets arrested.

There were no clear party lines, however many representatives for Eastern electoral districts subscribed to a common programme which emphasised separation from the Cape Colony or moving the seat of colonial government eastward, a vagrancy law, or increasing the property qualification part of the franchise (which would have reduced the number of non-Whites able to vote). Governor Sir George Grey, at the Tuynhuys. ==Electoral system== ===Voting system=== The election was conducted on the basis of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise: Cape residents qualified as voters based on a universal minimum level of property ownership, regardless of race. Elections to the upper house, the Cape Legislative Council, were conducted under a cumulative voting electoral system. This gave each voter several votes, which they could give to a single candidate, or split amongst several. This was justified by the Report from a Committee of the Board of Trade and Plantations on the basis that it would prevent any single group gaining a monopoly on power, as a minority voting in unison could ensure the return of their preferred candidate. The Cape Colony population at the time was majority Boer, with British settlers forming a minority. The British Government had pushed for the franchise property qualification to be low, thereby extending the franchise to the non-white population, who it was believed were more likely to side with the British than the Boers. The population for the colony was estimated at 225,000 in 1853, with blacks outnumbering whites by a ratio of 55:45. The ratio of registered voters however was heavily in favour of whites. ===Constituencies=== Provinces and electoral districts. For elections to the House of Assembly, the Cape was divided into 22 electoral divisions, returning a total of 46 members. The electoral division boundaries corresponded with the existing Cape Colony fiscal divisions. The only exceptions to this were for Albany, and the urban areas of Cape Town-Green Point and Grahamstown, (which were not included in the Cape electoral division), which had their own electoral divisions.

Other expansions were announced including a Russian front, as well as a modern-day war against North Korea, but they too were never released. The game was based on the World War II between the Americans and the Germans. The game was considered \\"hard to pick up\\" due to the \\"dense rulebook\\" and its rules were compared to miniature wargaming.

After the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, water melting off the glacier accumulated between the Rocky Mountains and the ice sheet. The lake drained along the front of the ice sheet, eastward towards the Judith River and the Missouri River. The maximum advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet blocked the drainages of north- and east-flowing rivers, forming glacial lakes along the margin of the ice. On the western Montana plains the Shelby lobe blocked the [Milk River, creating glacial Lake Twin River. Tributaries of the Marias River were also blocked by the Shelby lobe, leading to the formation of glacial lakes Cutbank and Choteau.

He was born in Paris to René Rochard and Marie Madeleine Talon. He showed early talent and, after his father died, helped support his mother and eleven siblings by drawing portraits. Rochard studied under Étienne Aubry and at the École des Beaux-Arts. He also studied miniature-painting from Emilie Bounieu (daughter of Michel Honoré Bounieu). At only twenty he painted a portrait of the Empress Joséphine for Napoleon and later other portraits of the imperial family. After Napoleon's return from Elba in 1815, he was drafted into the army but deserted and went to Brussels. There he received commissions to paint miniatures including at least one of the Duke of Wellington leader of the forces opposing Napoleon. Shortly after he moved to London and became very popular, painting numerous miniatures of members of the upper class such as Princess Charlotte. He exhibited mostly at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1816 to 1845. This lists the works displayed at the Royal Academy. In 1846 he moved to Brussels where he exhibited at the Salon there until 1869. He also exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1852 and the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris. He died in 1872. == Marriage and family == His first marriage to Henriette Petitjean ended in a separation but left Rochard with a daughter, Eugenie, born in 1814, who married an English officer. At the age of 80 (circa 1868) he married Henriette Pilton, by whom he had one son. (However his son, Jean Simon Rochard, was apparently born before 1856.) His younger brother, François Theodore Rochard (1798–1857), joined him in London around 1820. He was also a popular portrait painter specializing in miniatures and in water colors and won two silver medals from the new Society of British Artists in 1823. He retired after his marriage in 1850 and died on 31 October 1857 in London. ==Gallery== Frederick William Robert Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry KP, PC (1805 – 1872), Viscount Castlereagh (1822-1854), by Simon Jacques Rochard.jpgFrederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry (painted 1833) William Pollett Brown Chatteris by Simon Jacques Rochard (1788-1872), 1842.jpgWilliam Pollett Brown Chatteris of Sandleford (painted 1842) Simon- Jacques Rochard - Gertrude Anne Barnardiston Yates - Google Art Project.jpgGertrude Ann Barnardiston Yates (painted 1853) Harriet Ann Rooke, m.

The genus is characterised by the lateral arm plates being separated by small ventral plates. The colour is variable, ranging from yellowish-white to red, and the arms have transverse banding. Astrobrachion adhaerens, the only other species in the genus, is smaller and has longitudinal stripes on the arms. ==Distribution== The species is endemic to New Zealand and southeastern Australia, and normally occurs at depths of between . These depths are too deep for most scuba divers, which makes it difficult to study these basket stars. However, in the Fiordland in the south-western part of the South Island of New Zealand, unique conditions allow them and their black coral hosts to live in shallower waters where they are within the range of divers and more readily studied. ==Ecology== Black coral (pale) with a basket star coiled round a branch Black corals in the genus Antipathella host A. constrictum in a mutualistic association that seems to be a long-lasting arrangement: the basket stars coil their arms around the coral twigs and remain in the same locality for long periods, and possibly for life. The basket star has been found in a number of locations around New Zealand on the continental shelf but has never been found living freely, or living anywhere except in association with a black coral colony. The basket stars feed at night, uncoiling their arms from the coral and catching organic particles floating past. They also brush their arms against the coral surface and are probably feeding on detritus and any epizoic organisms that settle there. They are slow-growing, reaching their maximum size at approximately eight years of age. ==References== Category:Ophiuroidea Category:Animals described in 1900 Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Astrobrachion constrictum"},{"id":"56676894","text":"The Annobon leaf-toed gecko (Hemidactylus aporus) is a species of geckos in the family Gekkonidae.

The primary election was held June 5, 2018. Four of the nine seats of the San Diego City Council were contested. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, although most members do identify a party preference. A two-round system was used for the election, starting with a primary in June followed by a runoff in November between the top-two candidates in each district. The election resulted in a net gain of one seat for self-identified Democrats. This gave Democrats a two-thirds majority on the City Council, allowing them to override vetoes by Republican Mayor Kevin Faulconer on issues that divide along partisan lines. Additionally two incumbent council members were defeated, marking the first time any incumbent had lost a City Council election in the city since 1992. ==Campaign== Council Districts used for the 2018 election The even-numbered districts 2, 4, 6, and 8 were up for election in 2018. It was the first City Council election using the new rules that requires a runoff in November between the top-two candidates in the June primary whether or not any of the candidates get a majority of the vote. Incumbents Lorie Zapf (District 2), Myrtle Cole (District 4), and Chris Cate (District 6) stood for reelection. David Alvarez (District 8) was ineligible to run due to term limits. Republicans were considered more vulnerable to lose seats in the election due to the two Republican-held seats, Districts 2 and 6, being considered swing districts while the two Democrat-held seats, Districts 4 and 8, were considered safe districts. However, incumbents historically had not lost reelection to the San Diego City Council, and both Zapf and Cate had raised far more money than their challengers as of February 2018. == Results == === District 2 === District 2 consisted of the communities of Bay Ho/Bay Park/Morena, Midway/North Bay, Mission Beach, Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, and Point Loma. A large field of seven challengers qualified to run against incumbent council member Lorie Zapf. In the June primary, Zapf advanced to the general election to face retired doctor Jennifer Campbell. Campbell was elected to the City Council in the November general election, making Zapf one of the first incumbents on the City Council to lose a reelection bid since 1992. === District 4 === District 4 consisted of the communities of Alta Vista, Broadway Heights, Chollas View, Emerald Hills, Encanto, Greater Skyline Hills, Jamacha, Lincoln Park, Lomita Village, North Bay Terrace, Oak Park, O'Farrell, Paradise Hills, Redwood Village, Rolando Park, South Bay Terrace, Valencia Park, and Webster. Three challengers qualified to run against incumbent Council President Myrtle Cole, all from her own party. In the June primary, Cole advanced to the general election to face civil rights lawyer Monica Montgomery. Montgomery was elected to the City Council in the November general election, making Cole one of the first incumbents on the City Council to lose a reelection bid since 1992. This did not impact the partisan composition of the City Council since both Cole and Montgomery are Democrats. === District 6 === District 6 consisted of the communities of Clairemont Mesa, Kearny Mesa, Mira Mesa, Mission Valley, North Clairemont, and Rancho Peñasquitos. Five challengers qualified to run against incumbent council member Chris Cate. In the June primary, Cate advanced to the general election to face environmental advocate Tommy Hough. Cate was reelected in the November general election. === District 8 === District 8 consisted of the southern communities of San Diego and those along the Mexico–United States border, including the communities of Barrio Logan, Egger Highlands, Grant Hill, Logan Heights, Memorial, Nestor, Ocean View Hills, Otay Mesa West, Otay Mesa East, San Ysidro, Sherman Heights, Stockton, and Tijuana River Valley. Incumbent council member David Alvarez is ineligible to run due to term limits. Four candidates qualified to run for the open seat. In the June primary, Vivian Moreno, a political staffer in Alvarez's office, and Antonio Martinez, a community health clinic worker and member of the San Ysidro School District Board of Education, advanced to the general election. Moreno was then elected to the City Council in the November general election with a majority of the vote. ==Aftermath== On December 10, 2018, the new council was sworn in. For their first action, the council voted unanimously to appoint Georgette Gomez as council president. == References == San Diego City Council San Diego City Council Category:San Diego City Council elections Category:2010s in San Diego ","title":"2018 San Diego City Council election"},{"id":"56676956","text":"Alice Grófová (married name Chladeková), is a female former Czechoslovak international table tennis player.

An expansion called Villains and Women was scheduled for a 1996 release but never materialized. ==Gameplay== Gameplay involved each player assuming the role as the Directors of the British Secret Service and both played James Bond characters. Players deployed Missions, Villains, Obstacles, Locations, and Henchmen for opponents to fight, and if able, would also play a Plot stack each turn. Each Plot stack would make the mission more difficult. If you had the right cards to complete the mission, you scored points to win the game. ==Reception== Paul Pettengale reviewed James Bond 007: Golden Eye for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Pettengale comments that \\"It sounds great, but in practice very little gets done - it's too hard to get all of the necessary icons and scores together. Instead, each player builds up his own Plots until he has the required number, at which point he declares himself a winner.

Louis II finally succeeded in taking Belleperche, but could not prevent the truckers, Bernardon de la Salle, Bernard de Wisk and Hortingo de la Salle from escaping by taking the duchess hostage; she was not released until two years later for ransom.

He then moved to Louisiana and became known for his painted bright and colorful signs which can include distinguishing lettering, various animals, and slogans that include an assortment of French, English, and local New Orleans dialect. His style is often considered folk art or Haitian. He uses the term \\"deja vu art\\" to describe his work. His shop today resides in New Orleans on Magazine Street. == Biography == Simon Hardeveld was born in Cannes, France in 1951. His mother was French and his father was Dutch. Simon first started working as a chef in France. When he found this to be unsuccessful, he moved to Florida in 1981 to look for work. He met his wife Maria and they ran three different restaurants together. In 1994, he visited New Orleans for Mardi Gras and ended up making it his permanent home. He attempted to find cooking jobs there, but again had little success. He then found a job at a shop called Bush Antiques where he would repair French furniture. There he would take scrap wood and paint signs of food he was cooking at the time. He would place them in the restaurant he worked at in Metairie. People came to drink beer and would want to buy the signs Simon was making. Once he realized he could make money from his signs, he immediately stopped his culinary work. The owner of the antique shop he worked at would let him showcase his work there. Simon has not had any art training. In 2010, a local New Orleans TV station commissioned Simon to design the set of one of their evening pieces after the vice president of the station ate at a restaurant that displays Simon's work. He considers that as his claim to fame. Simon has also completed a multitude of other commercial signage for the businesses around him. His operation is low-tech, he doesn't use computers or emails, but even with this his signs are found everywhere in the city and almost instantly recognized. On August 20, 2016 he got a book published about his life and art called \\"Simon of New Orleans\\". He draws inspiration from people he meets in New Orleans. It's not uncommon for him to dig through trash for objects to use in his art. He spends his days now, still in New Orleans, making signs and with his wife and two bulldogs, Ike and Lily. == Ongoing Feud == Hand-painted signs have always been a part of New Orleans culture. They cost very little and they are durable. It is a dying market but it has become increasingly competitive. For nearly twenty years Simon and another artist have been arguing about copyright issues. The styles of Simon and the other artist are both considered iconic to the city. In 2016, at a festival in Midcity a sculpture of Simon was put up with him holding a sign that reads \\"Simon says: Buy the REAL Thing, Buy Dr. Bob Art”. Both sign-makers use the phrase \\"Be Nice or Leave\\" in their artworks. Simon claims he doesn't take credit for any of the slogans he uses and the other artist claims Simon is imitating his work. == References == Category:Artists from New Orleans Category:People from Cannes Category:1951 births Category:Folk artists Category:Living people ","title":"Simon of New Orleans"},{"id":"56677216","text":"Carlos Obregón Borrero (February 21, 1929 – January 1, 1963) was a Colombian poet from Bogota.

There in Schuaima, the planet country of the Neivan poet, one can sip with the nose curled by the wind the smell of \\"the skirts invaded with geraniums\\" of the girls who inhabit it and who, like all its inhabitants, have \\"very heart close to the nose \\"and whose language makes it possible\\" to converse with the heights, with the acorns, with the wind in its state of purity, with the cosmos in its millenary harmony. \\" Ignacio Ramírez In her verses it happens, the living sage of authentic poetry is latent. Adriana Herrera Aniquirona It is about from a collection of poems that points to another collection of poems -hightest spiral- where there are no words but silences as in the flowers, in tenderness, or in love. Luis Rafael Gálvez The raid on Back to Schuaima means conquering territories in the company of the most charming and enchanted character: Aniquirona, the beloved of all the dreamers on earth; the idealized one that puts us in communication with the beings that live beyond the daily flow. This thoughtfulness, the arrival of \\"Settlers\\" with their display of beauty captivating almost to delirium. The space that invades the one that follows with its unique aroma of forests and gardens, secret seas or aggressive rocks, or the subversive challenge of presences that are ignored despite their dazzling, sustain the spell, the great orchestration of all the elements. Matilde Espinosa These poems also appropriate an overwhelming poetic personality that, as in the other books of the author, creates a world and defends the features of that world, going through all the shades of black and gray, until achieving the very white texture, the turns sublime, religious, mystical, that distinguish the great poets. In Colombia, a country without a doubt difficult, there is poetry of great height, and this is the proof. Enrique Serrano By reading these Memoirs of Alexander de Brucco, we are witnessing the creation of a world that is indisputably supported by the aforementioned sacred history but is not defined there. It is now specified through the poem itself and the writing of the verse, defined and defended by the author himself through his images, his metaphors, through the poetic language and the tone that he reaches, through his own world and of his particular conception of history and myth. A book of poems that illuminates, that is full of light and colors and the nuances that are produced when the word passes through the prism that is the verse. Santiago Tobon Aniquirona: poetry, affluent towards mystery, deity of sounds and language, which can be transmuted into a woman, into magic or into the fire of things, but which will be, essentially, a song of nature. What river to wade, then, to reach the shore, to the transcendent? Travel with the poet through the forests \\"of winds and honeysuckle\\" and \\"very old chestnut trees\\", join in \\"the ceremony of flowers\\" and woo the light \\"in the breath of the air\\".

He is the author of the memoir Blindsided by the Taliban, a dark- humored retelling of his unusual injury in Afghanistan while embedded with American troops near the Pakistani border. In September 2010, Gentile was shot in the side of the head with a rocket-propelled grenade that did not detonate, although it blinded him in his right eye and crushed part of his skull. == Background == Gentile was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and attended Shadyside Academy. He graduated from Villanova University with a degree in philosophy and Islamic studies. == Events of Blindsided by the Taliban == On September 9, 2010, Gentile was walking through a remote village in mountainous, eastern Afghanistan in the company of American and Afghan troops. While reporting for CBS - Gentile was a freelance radio reporter who also occasionally contributed video - he was injured when an assailant fired a rocket-propelled grenade from a very short distance away. The ordnance struck Gentile in the side of the head, blinding him in his right eye and crushing bones in his cheek. The rocket then ricocheted off of Gentile and struck a young platoon leader, Lt. Derek Zotto, in the elbow. Gentile managed to capture his highly unusual injury on video. He underwent several surgeries including one at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. After numerous operations and months of rehabilitation, Gentile returned to Afghanistan and resumed front line reporting, which is chronicled in his critically acclaimed book Blindsided by the Taliban (2018). Since its publication, Gentile has been featured on NBC Today CNN Sunday Morning, C-Span and other leading programs. In November 2019, it was announced that George Marshall Ruge will direct the feature-film length adaptation of Blindsided by the Taliban. == Awards == Gentile is the recipient of the Galloway Award, named for UPI combat correspondent and McClatchy Newspapers columnist Joseph Galloway, for a story in Salon that is excerpted from Blindsided by the Taliban and is said to be both \\"straight-forward and harrowing.\\" == Motorcycle storytelling == In recent years, Gentile has combined storytelling from places like Iraq with his passion for motorcycling, writing stories for publications like Motorcyclist and the motorcycle media outlet One Down Media, of which Gentile is a founding partner. He has also ridden in and reported from Mexico and the United States. == Works == * Gentile, Carmen (March 6, 2018).

Contemporary Mongol sources describe Batu as invading with 12-14 tumens, which would give him a nominal strength of 120.000-140.000 men, mostly nomad cavalry archers. However, tumens were often at less than full strength, some elite units with as few as 1.000 horsemen. On the Russian side, contemporary sources mention only five princes by name, each of whom would be accompanied by his Druzhina, a small retinue of heavy cavalry. The princely retinue surpassed the Mongolian army in armament, both offensive and defensive. Massively heavy armor was used. However, these squads, as a rule, did not exceed the number of several hundred men, and were unsuitable for united actions under a single command. At the same time, the main part of the Old Russian army was the militia infantry. It was inferior to the nomads in armament and the ability to own it. The militia used axes and hunting spears (\\"rogatina\\"). Swords were rarely used, and they had no armor other than plain clothes and fur hats. For the infantry, consisting of poorly armed peasants and tradesmen, numbers are uncertain. The only specific numbers mentioned for the Russians are 1.700 men of Evpaty Kolovrat(The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan) and 3.000 men under Voivode Dorozh(Battle of the Sit River). However, these were exceptionally large numbers for Russian standards at the time. In 1242, Prince Alexander Nevski in Novgorod could muster no more than 1.000 Druzhina and 2.000 militia for the Battle on the Ice. So, it is safe to estimate that, on average, a Russian prince had hundreds of warriors in his retinue, rather than thousands. == Battle == After receiving envoys of Batu Khan and sending them to their overlord, Yuri II of Vladimir, border princes of Ryazan, Murom, and Pronsk gathered their forces and made a stand on the river Voronezh, waiting for reinforcements from Vladimir. They received none, and their small force was quickly scattered. == Aftermath == After the battle, Prince Yuri Igorevich retreated to Ryazan, while his nephew Prince Roman took some of his men north to Kolomna and joined the army of Vladimir-Suzdal. == References == Voronezh Category:Conflicts in 1237 Category:1237 in Europe Category:History of Ryazan Oblast Category:13th century in Russia Category:1237 in the Mongol Empire ","title":"Battle of Voronezh River"},{"id":"56677401","text":"James Henry Kenneth Oliver (10 August 1924 – 13 May 1994) was an English professional footballer who played as a defender for Sunderland. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Loughborough Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Brush Sports F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Ken Oliver"},{"id":"56677412","text":"Li Song-suk is a female former North Korean international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won a silver medal in the women's singles and a bronze medal in the women's doubles with Ro Jong-suk at the 1979 World Table Tennis Championships.

Dishes such as hamburgers, hotdogs, or barbeque ribs may be considered dude food, though dude food versions of these dishes often distinguish themselves with gourmet ingredients or exaggerated use of amenities like whiskey, barbecue sauce, bacon, or cheese. == Development == It is thought that the dude food trend originated in the early 2000s, most likely originating in the southern regions of the United States.Frost, Warwick et al, Gastronomy, Tourism and the Media, North York, Ontario, Channel View Publications, 2016 The common theory is that the trend arose from its affinity with the food truck and street food movements, defined by their offerings of “comfort and good quality food” made easily accessible. The trend expanded as a social media phenomenon, and its associated term was added to the Collins dictionary in 2016. Dude food has inspired a growing number of academic and non-academic literatureEisner-Levine, R. Mary, Men versus Food: An Analysis of Dude Food Television and Public Health, thesis, University of Western Ontario, 2014 with titles such as Dudefood: A Guy's Guide to Cooking Kick-Ass FoodChurchill, Dan, Dudefood: A Guy's Guide to Cooking Kick-Ass Food ,2015,Simon & Schuster and Dude Food: Recipes for the Modern Guy.Brooks, Karen & Bosker, Gideon, Dude Food: Recipes for the Modern Guy, 2000, Chronicle Books Although the trend has spread widely within public consciousness, journalists, bloggers, and academics struggle to coin a precise, widely accepted definition for \\"dude food.\\" The various proposed definitions share elements such as gender stereotypes, the predominance of heavy meat dishes, and the influence of \\"feminine\\" types of food. Increased awareness of the implications of high cholesterol diets and recent findings suggesting men are twice as likely as women to suffer severe heart problems (heart attacks and coronary heart disease) https://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart- public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_449846.pdf appears to have broadened dude food offerings so as to encompass light, vegetable-based options, to the detriment of their formerly characteristic meat options.The Food People, Food and Beverage Trends Framework for 2017-18 at: https://thefoodpeople.co.uk/blog/thefoodpeople-food-and-beverage-trends- framework-for-2017-18 == Geographical diffusion == The trend is said to have originated in North America, moreover, following its success the trend has geographically expanded into other countries, reaching during the following years Europe, Oceania and also at last Asia. Indeed, the trend seems to have arrived, following its North American origins, at first also in the United Kingdom, where it has allegedly influenced a number of “dude food” inspired restaurants, that have therefore mixed their British national dishes with “dude food” characteristics. The same seems to be happening also in Australia, combined with the unsatisfaction with fast food and the demand of higher- quality, but not necessarily per se healthy food. \\"Dude food\\" was considered to be one of the next biggest growing trend for the year 2018, to be arriving also in Japan, influencing the usual healthy, rice and fish based cuisine and combining it with the more heavy and greasy dude food methodology. == Dude food advertising == Dude food advertising and representation tends to follow the traditional gender binary and can be analyzed from a visual perspective, that is by taking into account how gender identity is represented in the food field. Thus, food is considered to be part of those products which are “gendered in a practice of normative sexual dualism reinforced and maintained within (…) cultural institutions of marketing communication and market segmentation”. According to this, advertising plays a significant role in defining this dualism concerning gender identity since its language represents a tool contributing to the creation and reflection of social norms. According to Katherine Parkin,Parkin, Katherine, Food Is Love: Food Advertising and Gender Roles in Modern America, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006 the gender binary in advertising took shape in 50s, following the theories of Ernest Dichter. She believed that “by convincing Americans of a food’s sex and its resultant gendered identity, as well as its sensuality, advertisers could suggest their foods to meet consumers’ need to fulfill their gender roles”Parkin, Katherine, The Sex of Food and Ernest Dichter: The Illusion of Inevitability, Vol. 5, Issue 2, Advertising & Society Review, 2004 and “Dichter believed that many people categorized the sex of foods. However, his own subscription to a gendered taxonomy of food is evident in his assessment of the findings”. Moreover, it might be important to notice that not only the food product itself but also the related packaging and advertisement are employed as tools to transmit an idea of how men and women should be, stressing again the cultural and social awareness raised by studies on dude food. An example of advertising in England is the Ginsters (English food company) advertisement of a beef pasty accompanied by the hashtag #FeedTheMan, in which there is a man that tells a joke in front of his girlfriend’s bosses; but he is talking about Ginsters, thus she has nothing to worry about, because it’s a type of food that makes everyone agree. In accordance with Lynsey Atkin, advertisement agencies and brands have honed in on a crisis of masculinity in our society and “in times of insecurity, brands can repurpose themselves as champions of the everyman, facilitators of the macho clean, however small. In other words, promising gender-traditional-prowess, like being able to kick a football in a straight line, could be the media- constructed equivalent of helping you grow a beard. Some stereotypes, like male dominance in social situations, are invoked as a nostalgia (a dream of the football-playing and beard-growing of days gone by)\\". In some places it can be hard to find an advertisement of men eating chocolate. However, in Canada there is an advertisement of chocolate bar Mr. Big produced by Cadbury, in which the snack is oversexualized and associated with virility, with the slogan “When you're this big they call you Mister”. Furthermore, specific events and moving tours were organised in Canada and promoted in order to provide dude food dishes and a certain atmosphere; they were born specifically to satisfy men's tastes, whereas women were welcomed but only as supporters of their men. == Gender and food == According to the feminist scholar Judith Butler, gender is “…an identity tenuously constituted in time (…) instituted through a stylized repetition of acts”. In fact, “...performing food labor is intertwined with performing gender”. In particular, several studies focus on how certain foods, drinks, or ways of eating and drinking are interpreted as “masculine”; a crucial example of this attributed masculinity to certain types of food is represented by dude food. Significantly, scholars have been suggesting that this masculinisation of food practices might allegedly be the expression of masculine privilege which “manifests around food and cooking in a myriad of ways”. Dude food has been extremely crucial as it has raise the interest of the scholarly world as to why the Western cultural and social system defines gender by looking at people's food choices. Barbecuing is sometimes seen as an activity through which men might enhance their masculinity Meat is considered to be one of the most important ingredients of “manly” food, since meat conveys meaning of “...sexuality and virility…”. Thus, if masculinity is related to meat, a mostly vegetarian diet is inevitably interpreted as feminine. Not only the consumption of meat, but also the various ways in which it is cooked are associated with a specific idea of masculinity. For instance, barbecued meat and its consumption have always been seen as a rather masculine activity. There is an increase growing literature demonstrating how types of unhealthy food are interpreted to be masculine due to the presence, in our belief system, of cultural stereotypes according to which women tend to eat more healthily than men. This differentiation could also be attributed to the packaging of food products. Strong stereotypes are deeply embedded also in people’s buying preferences. The cultural basis of these stereotypes regarding food choices and gender perception is the desire from part of our social system to protect and maintain its hegemonic masculine norms.Gough, Brendan, “Real men don’t diet”: An analysis of contemporary newspaper representation of men, food and health in “Social Science & Medicine” vol. 64, University of Leeds, 2006 The interest toward dude food is leading people to re-think about the reasons behind food choices and why it should be \\"...enjoyed.

She was a restaurateur, culture-bearer, and community organizer. She opened the Calypso Restaurant in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 1943. The restaurant, first located at 146 MacDougal Street, served West Indian cuisine in an ambiance of music from Trinidad. Among the early integrated establishments in the Village, It sponsored costume balls and galas throughout the 1940s and early 50s, often at Irving Plaza, off Union Square. it served as a Bohemian gathering place where intellectuals and artists could hear West Indian music and eat West Indian food. Williams was a mentor for the young James Baldwin., who worked for Williams when he was 19 years of age, after moving from Harlem to Greenwich village when his stepfather died. In the early 1960s,after relocating to the West Coast, she opened Connie's Restaurant in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. She later moved her restaurant to the Fillmore District, San Francisco, after the Hippie movement in the Haight-Ashbury her clientele diminished. ==Biography== Little is known about Williams's early years in Trinidad. A devotee of calypso, she published a booklet in 1959 entitled \\"12 Songs from Trinidad\\" which included two songs about the British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39 oilfield strike in Trinidad: 'King Flecky' and another based on the World War I calypso \\"Run Your Run Kaiser William\\". In 1943 the Calypso Restaurant opened and James Baldwin was hired as a busser and dish washer. Early in Baldwin's career at the Calypso he met artists, writers, and activists such as Beauford Delaney (the modernist painter who introduced James Baldwin to Connie Williams in 1943), Marlon Brando (then an acting student), and labor organizerStan Weir. With the encouragement and support of Williams and Delaney the young Baldwin developed as a writer and intellectual. Williams remained friends with Baldwin throughout his life, hosting a birthday party for him on 20 May 1963 at her San Francisco restaurant on Fillmore Street. Connie took the young James Baldwin 'under her wing'. Other artists, performers, and intellectuals who frequented The Calypso included Henry Miller, C. L. R. James, Tennessee Williams, Eartha Kitt, Paul Robeson, Richard Wright (author), Grace Lee Boggs, and Paul Robeson. During and after the U.S. calypso boom which peaked during WWII, Williams promoted many prominent calypsonians and bandleaders in New York City—Gerald Clark, MacBeth the Great, Lord Invader, Wilmoth Houdini, The Duke of Iron, and others—whom she hired to play at holiday dances and carnival balls. These events also featured dancers such as Ismay Andrews and Pearl Primus. In 1962 Connie founded Connie's West- Indian Restaurant in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury. The restaurant was a favorite for black intellectuals and, like her West VIllage restaurant, was frequented by James Baldwin when he came to San Francisco. In 1969, Connie’s Restaurant relocated to 1909 Fillmore St in San Francisco after the Hippie \\"invasion\\" of Haight-Ashbury. In 1976 Connie organized the first carnival in San Francisco. Connie was the founder of Carijama Oakland Carnival, a San Francisco Bay Area carnival begun in the 70s. She was also one of the founders of the Carnival West Coast Caribbean Association. ==References== Category:Calypsonians Category:Year of birth missing Category:Trinidad and Tobago musicians Category:Restaurateurs Category:Women restaurateurs ","title":"Connie Williams (Trinidadian)"},{"id":"56677461","text":"Park Mi-ra is a female South Korean former international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won a bronze medal in the women's singles and a gold medal in the Corbillon Cup (women's team event) at the 1973 World Table Tennis Championships with Chung Hyun-sook, Lee Ailesa and Kim Soon-ok for South Korea. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:South Korean female table tennis players Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ","title":"Park Mi-ra (table tennis)"},{"id":"56677473","text":"Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares were the defending champions and successfully defended their title, defeating Bob and Mike Bryan in the final, 7–6(7–4), 7–5. ==Seeds== ==Draw== ===Draw=== ==Qualifying== ===Seeds=== ===Qualifiers=== # Radu Albot / Nikoloz Basilashvili ===Lucky losers=== # Max Mirnyi / Philipp Oswald ===Qualifying draw=== ==References== * Main draw * Qualifying draw Category:2018 Abierto Mexicano Telcel ","title":"2018 Abierto Mexicano Telcel – Men's Doubles"},{"id":"56677480","text":"John Abraham Page (10 February 1893 – 1964) was an English professional footballer who played as a winger for Sunderland. ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Category:Footballers from Tyne and Wear Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Sunderland West End F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Date of death missing ","title":"Jack Page (footballer, born 1893)"},{"id":"56677500","text":"Lee Soo-ja (born 1960) is a female former South Korean international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== She won a bronze medal in the women's singles and a silver medal in the Corbillon Cup (women's team event) at the 1981 World Table Tennis Championships.

Corin was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. == Education and shooting == As a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Jaclyn Corin was the junior class president at the time of the shooting in 2018. Her close friends Joaquin Oliver and Jaime Guttenberg were killed; she had once tutored the alleged gunman and former student at the school, Nikolas Cruz. During the shooting, Corin was locked in with other classmates for several hours, emerging with hands up as instructed by the police SWAT units. == Advocacy == Corin met with fellow students at Stoneman Douglas, including David Hogg, Emma González and Cameron Kasky, at Kasky's house; they formed the Never Again MSD movement during these meetings. At first it was a small core group of students, but subsequent meetings came to about twenty students. She explained that their media strategy was to knock through the gun-safety defeatism, reframe the debate, and keep making noise with powerful demonstrations. They acted quickly to take advantage of the news coverage. Corin was a key organizer of the bus trip protest to the Florida state capital on February 20, six days after the shooting. A report in Vanity Fair suggested it was her idea to have the bus trip soon after the shooting because it was alive in the news cycle; she said \\"the news forgets -- very quickly -- we needed a critical mass event.\\" Working with fellow students- turned-activists Cameron Kasky and David Hogg, she recruited several hundred MSD students to make an eight-hour bus trip to Tallahassee as part of a \\"lightning strike\\". She helped engineer the behind-the-scenes logistics including transportation, chaperone and sleeping arrangements, scheduling meetings with Florida lawmakers and getting permission slips from parents. She demanded the group wear normal school attire and not quibble about bus seating; when some asked for changes to sit with friends, she said \\"No -- get on your bus.\\" The trip was organized largely by social media and texting. Corin was a key planner of the March for Our Lives nationwide student protest that occurred on March 24. She advocates that adults register to vote and vote, and that children pre-register. She discussed media coverage: Corin has made YouTube videos; one called \\"WhatIf\\" got 1.4 million views in three days. She has appeared on national television.

The app was released for iOS in May 2013, with an Android version released in March 2014. In multiple funding rounds following the app's initial release, Gametime has raised a total of from various investors. The app received an award from each SportsBusiness Daily and the Appy Awards in 2017, and Gametime United was named among the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. in various categories by Deloitte, Inc. and Accel Partners. == Features == Gametime allows users to purchase tickets for sports events, including MLB, NFL, NCAA, NBA, NHL and MLS games and WrestleMania, AMA Supercross Championship and PGA Tour events, as well as music events, such as concerts, and other performances, including comedy and theater. The app compiles data of unsold tickets from various suppliers and displays the 50 best results for the selected venue, determined by price and location through a proprietary algorithm. To do so, Gametime curates available tickets from suppliers that include teams, primary and secondary ticket outlets, and users of the app itself. Seat options are accompanied by photographs of the view from the seat and the seat's location in the form of a map pin on a map of the venue, where possible. As time draws closer to an event's start, Gametime strategically reduces ticket prices for last-minute customers, as those tickets generally lose value during this timeframe. Tickets for each event are available until 90 minutes after the event started. Gametime recorded that around 80% of transactions take place up to seven days before an event, 50% of those on the day of the event, and more than 10% after that event's start. Tickets purchased through the app are made available digitally through the customer's phone, with a barcode that would be scanned by the venues' scanners or entrance personnel, removing the need to print the tickets. Griffith, who uses the app himself, considered this to be the app's best feature. Payment transactions are handled using Apple Pay and Google Pay, respective to the user's platform; additional integrations for PayPal's Venmo service were added on the day of the service's third-party support introduction. Gametime High Fives, a rewards program introduced in August 2015, rewarded people who bought tickets to three or more MLB events in which the home team won, a voucher for use within the app. In April 2016, Gametime was updated with the Snap and Sell feature, which added a user-side ticket resale functionality to the app. Using Snap and Sell, users can take pictures of sports tickets, which are then analyzed using optical character recognition for validity and placed onto the app's marketplace if they apply to its venue lineup. Griffith stated that the feature sought to make selling tickets as easy and accessible as possible, claiming that it only required three taps to bring the ticket to the market, when compared to competitors' \\"75 taps' worth of data entry\\" for the same functionality. Gametime Connect, released in June 2016, saw the integration of two friends-based features; users could see whether friends were presently selling tickets, and were given the ability to directly buy those specific tickets, and whether friends were going to attend an event, enabling users to buy tickets for it so they could attend it together. Gametime FanViews, introduced in April 2017, allows Gametime customers to share their feedback on the quality and atmosphere of the seating they had acquired through the app, and share photos of the event they attended. Information collected through FanViews is aggregated and presented to future customers at checkout. == Development == === Inception and expansion === Founder Brad Griffith, formerly a senior financial analyst for Google, developed the idea of a digital instant-ticketing system for mobile devices when he missed the first inning of an October 2012 National League Championship Series game between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals. Griffith had realized too late that, in order to validate the tickets, he had to print them out. He was convinced that there had to be a simpler way to purchase event tickets, and eventually decided to start developing an app that would fit this purpose, and founded San Francisco-based Gametime United to go with it. The resulting product was launched for smartphones running iOS in May 2013. An Android version of the app followed in March 2014, and one for Apple Watch devices was released in May 2015. Initially, Gametime only offered tickets for select stadiums in San Francisco, but soon expanded to Los Angeles. The number of available venues rose to 35 cities the U.S. and Canada by July 2015, and covered 48 cities by February 2016, with over 500 teams featured. Presently, Gametime offers tickets in 60 cities in North America. In August 2015, Gametime advanced into offering tickets for college football, adding 50 of the U.S.' top programs to their catalog. In December 2015, Gametime announced that they would expand into tickets from the music industry, such as those for concerts, to broaden their market availability. In addition to last-minute sales, as is with the case with their sports tickets, admissions to music venues would also be available for purchase several months in advance. In March 2017, Gametime United employed 80 staff members in its San Francisco offices. According to Griffith, the average Gametime user is a 31-year old white male with a household income of , younger than average customers of other companies in the market, and said to be \\"nearly an inverse\\" of MLB's demographic. By focusing on the mobile market, Gametime aims at targeting millennials, which comprise 75% of the app's user base. === Funding === Initial funding for Gametime covered backed by the founders of HotelTonight, the owners of sports clubs like those of the San Francisco Giants, and Xobni co-founder Matt Brezina. In a September 2014 seed funding round led by Accel Partners, Gametime received a total of . Investors included executives of HotelTonight, Box, the San Francisco Giants, the Vancouver Whitecaps, Yahoo!, TIBCO Software, the Sacramento Kings and StubHub. Following the investment, StubHub's founder and investment partner, Colin Evans, moved to Gametime United as chief revenue officer. A series A round, again led by Accel Partners, was held in May 2015, adding . Top investors included key people of the Philadelphia 76ers, the New Jersey Devils and Trunk Club, among multiple partners from previous rounds. An independently hosted series B round attracted new investors, such as GV, Evolution Media Partners and StartX. The round, held in September 2016, raised another for Gametime. According to Crunchbase, Gametime has raised a total in funding to date. === Partnerships === In September 2015, Gametime signed a partnership with digital fan destination Bleacher Report for integration within the latter's Team Stream app. As part of the deal, Team Stream would show its users advertisements of inexpensive tickets for upcoming games of their sports teams of interest, which then directly linked to the venues' pages within Gametime. In May 2017, Ticketmaster entered an agreement with Gametime which allowed them to distribute their tickets over the app, with proceeds shared between the two companies and the tickets' respective teams. With the partnership, Ticketmaster sought to better reach Gametime's young target audience and \\"fish where the fish are\\". According to Ticketmaster's chief commercial officer, Greg Economou, 12,000 teams and venues that used Ticketmaster would receive a secondary purchase option through Gametime. Financials of the deal were not disclosed. === Recognition === With revenue growth of 3,856% between 2013 and 2016, Gametime United was named the \\"fastest growing digital content/media/entertainment company\\" in Deloitte's 2017 Technology Fast 500. Inc. observed a 34,021% overall three-year growth for the company, as well as revenue in 2016, judging them the third-fastest growing company in America in their 2017 Inc. 5000. At the same time, Inc. further revealed Gametime United as the fastest-growing consumer products company in the U.S. According to Brian O'Malley of Accel Partners, Gametime reached in gross sales in their 2016 fiscal year, because of which it was \\"the fastest growing ticketing company ever\\". Also in 2017, Gametime was named \\"Best in Mobile Fan Experience\\" by SportsBusiness Daily, and was given an award in the \\"Events\\" category at the Appy Awards. == References == == External links == * Category:2012 establishments in California Category:American companies established in 2012 Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Entertainment companies established in 2012 Category:Internet properties established in 2012 Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:IOS software Category:Ticket sales companies Category:WatchOS software ","title":"Gametime"},{"id":"56677599","text":"Aleksandar Inđić (born 24 August 1995) is a Serbian chess grandmaster.

The Attack on Amsterdam in July 1650 was part of a planned coup d'état by stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange to break the power of the regenten in the Dutch Republic, especially the County of Holland. The coup failed, because the army of the Frisian stadtholder William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz got lost on the way to Amsterdam in the rainy night of 29 to 30 July. It was discovered, and once the city had been warned, it had enough time to prepare for an attack. The attempted coup made the House of Orange extremely unpopular for a lengthy period of time, and was one of the main reasons for the origins of the First Stadtholderless Period (1650–1672). == Background == {style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\\" - align=middle148px align=middle150px - align=left; colspan=2Stadtholders William II and William Frederick jointly devised the dual coup d'état. } The cause of the conflict lay in a dispute on ending the Eighty Year's War. The provinces of Utrecht and Zeeland and stadtholder William II wanted to continue the war: Utrecht for more favourable peace terms, Zeeland to keep blocking the Flemish ports for commercial ships, and William II because military achievements gave him more prestige and power. The other provinces, led by Holland, preferred peace to secure trade and reduce army upkeep costs. The latter eventually had their way when the Peace of Münster was signed on 30 January 1648. Early 1649, the army still consisted of 35,000 mercenaries, and Holland (especially the dominant city of Amsterdam) wanted to reduce their number to 26,000. After negotiations, a compromise was reached, and 29,250 troops were left by summer. William II, however, was keen on leading a punitive expedition to England, where his father-in-law, king Charles I, had been decapitated on 30 January 1649, and the republic had been proclaimed; whilst the States of Holland urged to reduce the number of troops even further. William II devised plans to get his way. At the end of 1649, a false pamphlet later known as The Eleven Articles (De elf artikelen) was widely distributed, claiming that Amsterdam was in league with England and intended to strike the other six provinces and everyone in Holland who opposed Amsterdam. It is thought that William II had this rumour spread to win sympathy for his cause against Amsterdam. He wanted to execute his plans in the spring of 1650, stemming from his astrological belief that the position of the Moon, Mars and Saturn would be favourable for a change of government, but eventually he would not act until summer. In May 1650, the States of Holland decided with 11 votes to 8 to disband the troops, and henceforth refused to pay part of the remaining soldiers' salary. The States General called the resolution of Holland illegal, landing the Republic in a political crisis. The States General argued that defence was a duty of the entire Union, and not of the constituent provinces: Holland should pay its due. Morally supported by the States General, William II first decided to appoint a commission (with himself as its chairman) that would visit the cities of Holland to plead for a large army, but without success. Then he resorted to coercion. == Failed coup d'état == {style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin: 10px; border: 1px #CCCCCC solid; background:#F9F9F9\\" - align=middle150px align=middle144px - align=left; colspan=2Regenten Cornelis and Andries Bicker readied Amsterdam's defences in time for a siege. } The Frisian stadtholder William Frederick of Nassau-Dietz advanced across the Veluwe in the night of 29 July on the orders of William II. He headed for Amsterdam to take the city by surprise, and to force it to pay the soldiers' wages. Two of the three companies, under Cornelis van Aerssen and Frederick van Dohna-Carwinden, lost the trail in the middle of the rainy night on the misty heath near Hilversum. A postman from Hamburg heading for Amsterdam ran into the forces, and warned Gerard Andriesz. Bicker (1622–1666), the drost of Muiden, who immediately left for Amsterdam to inform his uncle, burgemeester Cornelis Bicker. The latter and former burgemeester Andries Bicker rallied the city guard, hired 2,000 mercenaries, lifted the bridges, closed the gates and positioned the artillery. Not until 9 o'clock in the morning the stadtholderian troops reached Abcoude. Now that a rushed entry was made impossible, they camped on the outskirts. An attack was postponed for the time being. Meanwhile, William II had six prominent members of the States of Holland arrested. The delegates from Haarlem, Delft, Hoorn, Medemblik, and Dordrecht (Jacob de Witt), were abducted under a strict guard to Loevestein Castle, some accompanied by their servants or their sons. On 3 August, there were seventy companies under William Frederick's command near Abcoude. Burgemeester Cornelis Bicker took on Amsterdam's defence. William decided to negotiate with the Oetgens faction, opponents of the regenten family Bicker. On the condition that Andries and Cornelis Bicker would be put out of their offices, William would be prepared to withdraw his troops. == Aftermath == The Grand Assembly of 1651 decided to appoint no new stadtholder, commencing the First Stadtholderless Period. The coup was largely a failure because the attack on Amsterdam did not succeed. Under pressure of the States, the Loevesteinian regenten were released one by one from 17 to 22 August. The regenten now realised that the stadtholder was prepared to use violence to maintain and expand his power. This led to the rise of the so-called Loevestein faction amongst regenten who desired a republic without Orange. Before 1650, few had taken an interest in justifying or altering the form of government of the Dutch Republic, and the role of the stadtholderate within it (Hugo Grotius was an exception to this; his On the Antiquity of the Batavian Republic (1610) primarily attempted the first). At Leiden University, professors even taught to their students that a moderate monarchy was the best form of government. After William II's attempted coup of July 1650, however, these attitudes would change radically. On 6 November, William II unexpectedly died of smallpox aged 24. Shortly after on 14 November, princess-widow Mary Henrietta Stuart gave birth to a son, the later king-stadtholder William III. After the sudden passing of William II, Groningen and Drenthe decided to appoint William Frederick as their stadtholder as well. However, his attempts to have the other provinces recognise him as the regent of William III did not work out (only in Overijssel he was accepted as such by two-thirds of the province). With the failed stadtholderian coup still in fresh memory, the lack of a stadtholder was a welcome turn of events. Thus, the rest of the Republic entered the First Stadtholderless Period. During the Grand Assembly of 1651, these five provinces definitively agreed not to appoint a new stadtholder. In the Act of Seclusion, a secret clause that was a peace condition for the Dutch defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54), the States of Holland also promised The Protectorate to never appoint William III as stadtholder, and in his Deduction the Loevesteinian leader Johan de Witt would successfully defend this deal in the States General. This situation remained in force until the Rampjaar (1672). == References == Category:1650 Category:17th century in Amsterdam Category:Military history of the Dutch Republic Category:Political history of the Dutch Republic ","title":"Attack on Amsterdam (1650)"},{"id":"56677651","text":"Bernard de Wisk was a mercenary captain and sometime brigand of the Hundred Years War.

A Mars suit or Mars space suit is a space suit for EVAs on the planet Mars. Compared to a suit designed for space-walking in the near vacuum of low Earth orbit, Mars suits have a greater focus on actual walking and a need for abrasion resistance. Mars' surface gravity is 37.8% of Earth's, approximately 2.3 times that of the Moon, so weight is a significant concern, but there are fewer thermal demands compared to open space. At the surface the suits would contend with the atmosphere of Mars, which has a pressure of about . On the surface, radiation exposure is a concern, especially solar flare events, which can dramatically increase the amount of radiation over a short time. Some of the issues a Mars suit for surface operations would face include having enough oxygen for the person as the air is mostly carbon dioxide; in addition the air is also at a much lower pressure than Earth's atmosphere at sea level. Other issues include the Martian dust, low temperatures, and radiation. ==Overview== Mars suit's footwear would presumably make direct contact with an extraterrestrial surface; lunar footprint shown. Rover tracks on Mars One design for a Mars suit from the 2010s, the NASA Z-2 suit, would have electroluminescent patches to help crew members identify one another. Three types of tests planned for the Z-2 include tests in a vacuum chamber, tests in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (a large pool for mimicking zero-g), and tests in a rocky desert area. (See also: Z series space suits.) The planned Mars 2020 rover has a materials test that is hoped will aid Mars suit development, the SHERLOC experiment; it includes a test target with space suit materials. The test will measure how these suit materials are affected by the Martian environment. Six materials have been chosen for testing: Orthofabric, Teflon, nGimat-coated Teflon, Dacron, Vectran, and Polycarbonate. The test will help select the best materials for future Mars space suits. Orthofabric is a polymeric material composed of a weave of GORE-TEX fibers, Nomex, and Kevlar-29. NASA tested possible Mars space suit materials by exposing them to Mars-equivalent ultraviolet (UV) radiation for 2500 hours, and then studied how the materials were affected. One of the concerns for the Mars suits is how materials respond to chemically reactive Mars dust and exposure to ultraviolet, especially over the lengths of time and amount of use the suits are expected to function. One researcher working on a design for Mars surface EVA suits was inspired in part by Medieval armor suits. Some ideas for a Mars suits are a Heads-up display projected in the visor, built-in communications equipment, life support, and a voice-recognition assistant. Examples of design concerns: * High-speed winds filled with abrasive Mars dust. * Radiation such as cosmic rays. * Low temperatures down to minus 130 degree Celsius (-202 Fahrenheit, 143 degrees Kelvin). * Exposure to ultraviolet light. One Mars mission design aspect is whether the Mars suits should also be made to work in space, or should be for the surface only. ===Designs=== NASA AX-5 hard space suit The Biosuit is a mechanical counterpressure suit, resulting in a body hugging form. In this type of suit, the pressure would come from the structure and elasticity of the material, whereas with prior space-worn suits the pressure comes from pressurized gas, like a filled balloon. The gas pressure can make a flexible suit very rigid, like an inflated balloon. The Aoudo suit by the Austrian Space Forum is a space suit simulator for planetary surfaces. The suit ventilates with ambient air, but has a host of features to help simulate a space suit as well as tests enhancing technologies like a heads-up display inside the helmet. The AX-5 was part of a line of hard-suits developed at NASA Ames. Current suits are either soft or hybrid suits and use a lower-pressure pure oxygen atmosphere, which means people going on EVA must pre-breathe oxygen to avoid getting decompression sickness. A hard-suit can use a high- pressure atmosphere, eliminating the need to pre-breathe, but without being too hard to move like a high pressure soft suit would be. A simulated Mars suit was used for the HI-SEAS Earth-based spaceflight analog tests of the 2010s in Hawaii, USA. Mars suit design has been used as a topic for technology education. ==Comparison to Apollo lunar suit== Apollo Extravehicular Mobility Unit (lunar suit), from Apollo 17 The Apollo lunar EVA suit was called the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Besides the pressure suit, this included the Portable Life Support System (backpack) and an emergency Oxygen Purge System (OPS) which provided 30 minutes of oxygen for emergency. The combined system weighed 212 pounds on Earth, but only 35.1 pounds on the Moon.History of Space Suits { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Apollo Extravehicular Mobility Unit ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Mass ! scope=\\"col\\"  Moon ! scope=\\"col\\"  Mars ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gravity (Earth)  100%  16.54%  37.9%  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Suit     - ! scope=\\"row\\" PLSS     - ! scope=\\"row\\" Oxygen Purge System     - ! scope=\\"row\\" Total     } ==Environmental design requirements== The most critical factors for immediate survivability and comfort on the Martian surface are to provide: sufficient pressure to prevent the boiling of body fluids; supply of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide and water vapor for breathing; temperature control; and protection from cosmic radiation. ===Pressure=== Partial pressure suit for high-altitude flight The atmospheric pressure on Mars varies with elevation and seasons, but there is not enough pressure to sustain life without a pressure suit. The lowest pressure the human body can tolerate, known as the Armstrong limit, is the pressure at which water boils (vaporizes) at the temperature of a human body, which is about . The average pressure on Mars has been measured to be only about one-tenth of this, . The highest pressure, at the lowest elevation, the bottom of Hellas Basin, is , about twice the average. There is a seasonal variation over the Martian year (about two Earth years) as carbon dioxide (95.9% of the atmosphere) is sequentially frozen out, then sublimated back into the atmosphere when it is warmer, causing a global rise and fall in pressure. But the Martian atmosphere contains only 0.13–0.14% oxygen, compared to 20.9% of Earth's atmosphere. Thus breathing the Martian atmosphere is impossible; oxygen must be supplied, at a pressure in excess of the Armstrong limit. ===Breathing=== Average composition of the Martian atmosphere Humans take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide and water vapor when they breathe, and typically breathe between 12 and 20 times per minute at rest and up to 45 times per minute under high activity. At standard sea level conditions on Earth of , humans are breathing in 20.9% oxygen, at a partial pressure of . This is the required oxygen supply corresponding to normal Earth conditions. Humans generally require supplemental oxygen at altitudes above , so the absolute minimum safe oxygen requirement is a partial pressure of ICAO, Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet)), Doc 7488-CD, Third Edition, 1993, . For reference, the Apollo EMU used an operating pressure of on the Moon. Exhaled breath on Earth normally contains about 4% carbon dioxide and 16% oxygen, along with 78% nitrogen, plus about 0.2 to 0.3 liters of water.Respiratory Humidification: Basics Carbon dioxide slowly becomes increasingly toxic in high concentrations, and must be scrubbed from the breathing gas. A concept to scrub carbon dioxide from breathing air is to use re-usable amine bead carbon dioxide scrubbers. While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut's air, the other can vent scrubbed carbon dioxide to the Mars atmosphere. Once that process is completed, another scrubber can be used, and the one that was used can take a break. Another more traditional way to remove carbon dioxide from air is by a lithium hydroxide canister, however these need to be replaced periodically. Carbon dioxide removal systems are a standard part of habitable spacecraft designs, although their specifics vary. One idea to remove carbon dioxide is to use a zeolite molecular sieve, and then later the carbon dioxide can be removed from the material.NASA- Closing the Loop: Recycling Water and Air in Space - Page 2 of 7 If nitrogen is used to increase pressure as on the ISS, it is inert to humans, but can cause decompression sickness. Space suits typically operate at low pressure to make their balloon-like structure easier to move, so astronauts must spend a long time getting the nitrogen out of their system. The Apollo missions used a pure oxygen atmosphere in space except on the ground, to reduce risk of fire. There is also interest in hard suits that can handle higher internal pressures but are more flexible, so astronauts do not have to get the nitrogen out of their system before going on a spacewalk. ===Temperature=== A graph of Mars surface temperature data from a Mars surface probe (rover) There can be large temperature swings on Mars; for example, at the equator, daytime temperature may reach in the Martian summer, and drop down to at night. According to a 1958 NASA report, long-term human comfort requires temperatures in the range at 50% humidity. ===Radiation=== On Earth, in developed nations, humans are exposed to about 0.6 rads (6 mGy) per year, and aboard the International Space Station about 8 rads (80 mGy) per year. Humans can tolerate up to about 200 rads (2 Gy) of radiation without incurring permanent damage, however any radiation exposure carries risk so there is a focus on keeping exposure as low as possible. On the surface of Mars there are two main types of radiation: A steady dose from a variety of sources and solar proton events that can cause a dramatic increase in the amount of radiation for a short time. Solar flare events can cause a lethal dose to be delivered in hours if astronauts are caught unprotected, and this is a concern of NASA for human operations in space and on the surface of Mars. Mars does not have a large magnetic field in the same way as Earth, which shields the Earth from radiation, especially from solar flares. For example, the solar event which occurred on , just 5 months after Apollo 16, produced so much radiation, including a wave of accelerated particles like protons, that NASA became concerned what would happen if such an event were to occur while astronauts were in space. If the astronauts get too much radiation, it increases their lifetime cancer risk and they can get radiation poisoning. Exposure to ionizing radiation can also cause cataracts, a problem with the eye. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth's, so it does not stop as much radiation. The effect of radiation on medications taken on the mission is also of concern, especially if it alters their medical qualities. ==Additional design requirements== Operating in Mars suit on the surface creates a series of concerns for the human body, including an altered gravitational environment, a confined and isolated situation, a hostile exterior environment and closed environment inside, radiation, and extreme distance from Earth. An important consideration for the breathing air inside the suit, is that toxic gases to not get into the air supply. Reduced gravity environments can alter the distribution of fluids inside the body. One point of concern is changes in fine motor skill, especially if it interferes with the ability to use computer interfaces. ===Visors & UV=== A Gold-coated Visor is deployed during this astronaut's EVA in Earth orbit A thin layer of gold on the visor plastic bubble of current space helmets, shields the face from harmful parts of the Sun's spectrum. Visor designs, in general, have a design goal of allowing the astronaut to see, but block ultraviolet and heat, besides the pressure requirements.Controllable, Tinting, Polycarbonate Compatible Coatings for Advanced EVA Spacesuit Visor It has been detected that ultraviolet light does reach the surface of Mars. Martian carbon dioxide tends to block ultraviolet light of wavelengths shorter than about 190 nm, however above that there is less blocking depending on the amount of dust and Rayleigh scattering. Significant amounts of UVB and UVC light are noted to reach the surface of Mars. ===Toilet & Vomiting=== A human consideration for suits is the need to go the bathroom. Various methods have been employed in suits, and in the Shuttle-era NASA used maximum absorbency garments to enable stays of 10 hours in space and partial pressure suits. Another concern is vomiting, which has increased occurrence in spaceflight. ===Martian dust=== Apollo Moon suit became covered in lunar regolith dust during moonwalks. Another consideration is what would happen if astronauts somehow breathe in Mars dust. The health effect of Mars dust is a concern, based on known information about it which includes that it may be abrasive and/or reactive. Studies have been done with quartz dust and also compared it to lunar dust exposure. An Apollo 17 astronaut complained of hay fever like symptoms after his Moon walk. The lunar dust was known to cling to the space suits and be taken in with the astronauts when they came in to the Apollo Lunar Module. ==Use== The relative sizes of Deimos and Phobos as might be seen from the surface Mars, compared to the relative size in the sky of the Moon as seen from Earth. Depending on the condition, a night time EVA would mean seeing the Martian moons in the night sky at Mars. An article in the magazine Nature noted that due to the reduced gravity, the dynamics of walking on Mars would be different than on Earth. This is because people fall forward as part of their gait when moving, the motion of the center of body mass resembling that of an inverted pendulum. Compared to the Earth, all else being equal it would be half the amount of work to move, however a walking speed on Mars would be 3.4 km per hour rather than 5.5 km per hour on Earth. This data was produced by simulating Martian gravity for the duration of an aircraft following a flight profile that causes this type of acceleration. The acceleration of gravity at the surface of Mars is calculated to be about 3.7 meters per second2. It is not known if this reduced gravity causes the same kind of reduced muscle mass and biological effects as seen when living in microgravity aboard the ISS for several months. The gravity is about 38% of Earth's gravity at the surface. Rock climbing tests with a low-pressure IVA (intra vehicle activity) suit were conducted in Oregon, USA. The difficulty of grasping rock with gloves including moving fingers and gaining friction with rocks was noted, and ice climbing axes were helpful for climbing surfaces. Mountaineering on Mars may be needed when the terrain environments exceeds the abilities of a rover vehicle, or to access a target of interest, or simply to get home to a base. One common mountaineering need is a highly mobile short-stay shelter to use for overnight stays when climbing, such as a tent, and an equivalent for Mars might support the ability to get out of a space suit. Suit design for climbing would likely be impacted by the needs for climbing including suit flexibility, especially in the hands and also in terms of durability. Another issue is the expected amount of use for the suits in probably human mission designs. For example, as of the late 2010s there had been over 500 EVA's from the start of spaceflight, whereas a single mission to Mars is expected to need 1000 EVAs. Typical Mars mission plans note that a person wearing a Mars suit would need to enter a pressurized rover through an airlock. Alternatively, a Mars suit would need to be worn on crewed unpressurized rovers to provide life support. There are several different options for an egress and entry airlock for a space suit, and one of these is to repressurize the entire compartment as on the Apollo lunar lander. Some other ideas are suitport, crewlock, and transit airlock. Mars suits used in conjunction with other surface elements on Mars (artwork) ==Need== The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s. ==Suitport for Mars== Mars space suits have been explored for integration with airlock design that combines an airlock and suit entry and egress with another vehicle, and is commonly known as a suitport. This has been considered as a way to integrate a crewed pressurized Mars rover with Mars space suit EVAs. The idea is that a person would slide into the suit through an airlock opening while the exterior of suit is outside the vehicle and exposed to the Martian environment. Then, the hatch would be closed, sealing off the interior of the vehicle, and the person would be supported by the suit's life support system. NASA tested the Z-1 space suit for extraterrestrial surface EVA with a suitport design in the 2010s. In the NASA Z-1 design there is a hatch at the rear of the space suit that can be docked with a suitable vehicle or structure. ==Gallery== Visions of Mars EVA File:Humans on Mars.jpgHuman Mars mission designs usually include Mars EVA suits, in this vision people in suits in combination with crewed rovers and other equipment maneuver on the Martian surface. Mission enhancing technologies to give astronauts an edge are often explored, such as a wrist mounted video display of some kind in this case.

It was part of a dispersed community known as Boxelder, established by settlers in the 1880s. The ranch was established in 1893 by Charles Smith who built a one-room and later a three-room cabin on the property, as well as a barn. Three years later he sold the homestead to Willard Heber White. White and his wife lived on the ranch until 1928 when they moved to Douglas. On White's death in 1929, the ranch was purchased by Lloyd Huxtable and Charlie Olin. Lloyd and Olin built the present ranch house for Charlie and his wife Najima, Olin's sister, from 1933 to 1935. The Huxtables operated the ranch until his death at 86 in 1976. Huxtable served as a Converse County Commissioner from 1948 to 1956. ==Description== Structures on the ranch include the main ranch house, a garage, a house trailer, a stock shed, a laundry house/office, a shop and barns for chickens, horses and cows. The log house was built in 1933–35, measuring about by , and is built in a rustic Craftsman style with a prominent rubble stone foundation. The stock shed was built in the early 1940s.

Barhapple Loch is principally known for the discovery of a Crannog in 1878 on the loch, when it was drained. ==Settlements== Glenluce is the largest settlement in the area, and is located 3.9 miles from the loch in a southwesterly direction. Newton Stewart is around 10 miles to the northeast, along the A75 road. ==Geography== Barhapple Loch is located 4 miles (6.5 km) east of Glenluce. It is of glacial origin, of the Kettle hole type. To the south of the loch, is Derskelpin Farm. Slightly east of the farm is Dernaglar Loch. To the southwest is Dirlaughlin Hill at 114m and Knock Moss. To the east is Barhapple hill at 107m. To the east and north is Mark of Luce Moss. ==Discovery of Crannog== Barhapple Loch is only a few feet deep and surrounded by a deep peat bog, except on the east side, where it touched Barhapple hill, and rested on a bottom of soft peat. The black colour of the water and the inaccessible nature of the shore on the west side, precluded the discovery of any loch dwellings. In 1842, while James McCulloch was cutting peat, about 40 yards from the west side of the loch, he came upon a circle of stakes, numbering around 12. Ranging from thickness of a man's leg to a man's arm, and made of Hazel, they were about 5 feet long, with the heads two feet below the level of the ground. The circle was around 5 feet in diameter. During the autumn of 1978, the loch was drained, and in November, the tenant of the farm noticed a small round patch of logs that had become visible. ==Exploration== Plate III Plan of Crannog on Barhapple Loch On 15 October 1880, a party was formed and lead by the John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair to explore the crannog. Among the party of eight was Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, 3rd Baronet. The digging was stopped at a depth of between two and three feet by the appearance of water, but which point several discoveries were made. It was reported, that the loch-dwelling consisted of mainly oak piles and a platform of wood, with rough stone at some point. The discovery was located some 280 feet from the shore, with a gangway built from the east shore from the foot of Barhapple, where it is hard ground, at a length of 550 feet to facilitate viewing. The discovery was a row of oak piles, enclosing a space of 175 feet long from north to south and 127 feet wide, with rounded angles. Sir Herbert Maxwell took the first measurements of what remained of the crannog. 134 piles were visible, with a slight gap on the west side and larger one on the south side, with the piles on each side thingly set. It is surrounded by a row of oak piles, enclosing a space 175 feet long from north to south, and 127 feet broad, and rounded at the angles. The crannog appeared to be connected to the N and E shores of the loch by gangways on piles. A ring of Cannel coal of around 5.68 cm was discovered during the excavations. In 1884 a further excavation was undertaken. Some of the logs had rotted away, and others were pierced through by the shoots of the marsh plants, which gradually covered the partially drained area. The crannog were surveyed in July 2002, during the 2nd phase of the South-West Scotland Crannog Survey, with the intention of establishing an effective system of monitoring the rate of organic decay. Many of the timbers have a spongy consistency and with the shallow depth of the loch and changing levels, means they are unlikely to survive, with ongoing monitoring of the site being recommended. It was estimated that 3000 trees had been used to build the crannog. The frequent occurrences of the syllables der, dir and dar in the places near Barhapple indicate that they were heavily wooded by trees, long ago. A topographic rhyme, passed down the centuries and told to the narrator Robert Munro by the farmer Thomas McCormick of Mindork, in Kirkowan, 1 mile to the east of Barhapple Loch. It states: :Knocketie and Knockietore, Laniegoose and Laniegore, Dirnefuel and Dirniefranie, wee Barsolas and Derrnagie An underwater survey was conducted as part of the Survey. Further surveys were conducted in 2003 and 2004 as part of the South- West Scotland Crannog Survey. There has been 4 other lochs in Old Luce parish with crannogs. ==Fauna== Reconstructed crannog near Kenmore, Perth and Kinross, on Loch Tay, Scotland The north side of the loch is covered by a dense association of Phragmites Communis. On the west side, there is a considerable coverage of marsh, dominated by Carex rostrata and C filiformis. On the east shore it is gravelly and peaty. On the south side plants including Juncus bufonius, Juncus supinus and Peplis portula.

Though she uses mixed media, all of her works are on canvas and employ a \\"painting language.\\" Inspired by works done by an African- American artist, Romare Bearden, Tschabalala Self creates collages of various items that she has collected over time and sews them together to depict black female bodies that \\"defy the narrow spaces in which they are forced to exist\\", which she derives from the history behind the African-American struggle and oppression in society. Self reclaims the black female body and portrays them to be free of stereotypes without having to fear being punished. Her goal is to \\"create alternative narratives around the black body\\". Much of Self's work uses elements from black culture to construct quilt-like portraits. ==Early life== Self was born in 1990 in Harlem. ==Education== After graduating from Bard College with a B.A. in 2012, Self completed her M.F.A. in painting and printmaking at the Yale School of Art. Self has also held residencies at the American Academy in Rome, the La Brea Studio, T293 in Naples, Italy, and Red Bull House of Art in Detroit. ==Career== Self's first solo show was in 2015 at Schur-Narula in Berlin. In a review of a solo show at Thierry Goldberg gallery in New York in 2016, The New York Times declared, \\"Ms. Self’s work has great promise, which she is developing.\\" Peter Schjeldahl compared her piece at the New Museum's 2017 \\"Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon\\" to the works of Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning. Self's work has also been featured in a solo exhibition at the Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art in London. Self's work is in the permanent collection of Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, California; Perez Art Museum Miami, Miami, Florida; Rubell Family Collection, Miami, Florida, and the JP Morgan Chase Art Collection. == Artistic style == Self has said, \\"I use materials in an unconventional way to subvert the status quo. You don’t have to use paint to make a painting. It aligns with my overall message, which is one of change.\\" The use of unconventional materials help to highlight the unique shapes of a body because it separates the emphasis of each part from the whole structure of the artwork and creates an individual space for the pieces to express rather than to perform for the audience. Self starts her artwork with a line drawing of the character she wants to illustrate, then takes different objects to create her collage of items to go over that drawing. She uses shapes to build her characters while emphasizing objects or parts of the body that might be noticed first or carry a psychological or physical weight to them. Several of Self's works are sexually explicit. Self’s Rainbow piece, which consists of wood, acrylic paint, and other elements, portrays a black woman bending down, exposing her genitalia. Another of Self’s work Swim involves a man and woman joined together in a sexual act while still displaying certain parts of the body that hold more emphasis, in particular, the buttocks. The black female bodies in her artwork are often described as nonbinary or \\"genderless\\" because they do not conform to the westernized form of beauty that is usually seen in the art world. Tschabalala Self's art style revolves around the representation of black women through primary (genitalia) and secondary (body changes/ features) sexual characteristics by painting and utilizing printmaking . In developing her characters, Self exclaims, \\"The images all start from a drawing. And from that drawing I try to build a body or build the features of the subject I’m creating… I think that they are really sincerely built bit by bit.\\", the body is made up of several different yet crucial parts which makes the body exaggerations in people complex with layers of racial discrimination and prejudice following along stigmas . Through her art, Self comments upon the normalization and objectification of the body with a romanticized perspective . The characters illustrated in her artworks all share exaggerated body and facial features, and in doing so, allude to a racial and generational trauma embedded within each painting https://www.pilarcorrias.com/news/tschabalala- self-in-mood-at-moma-ps1/. The people in her artwork are made from different textures and prints of clothing which emphasize and direct the attention of the audience towards the most significant part in her artwork . Her particular artistic style gravitates towards black women embracing independence and resilience leaving a strong and fierce presence . Self’s approach is most commonly androgynous and does not solely reference one gender . \\\\---- === Works === One of Self's most prominent works, The Function, sheds light into the social aspect of the art piece and explains the abstract nature of the figure and its background. Tschabalala states in an interview, “A stereotype is a flat character with two dimensions. And I can confront those stereotypical images by making round, multidimensional characters with complicated desires, inner dialogues, and psychology.\\" The art piece is created by patching together pieces of old paintings, raw canvas, and fabrics which are assembled by stretching, painting and drawing over them. This gives the avatar a greater sense of dimension as it highlights the dynamic motion of turning one’s back indicated by the creased fabric. Furthermore, Self said in an interview, \\"My work does not comment on stereotypes and generalizations about the black female body, my practice absorbs these fantasies. The work is celebratory because one must thrive despite destructive rhetoric.\\" Self’s avatar portrays a great deal of confidence. The way her body is angled reveals her exposed chest and creates a divided space between her range of motion and the peripheral vision of the audience. The avatar flaunts her conviction by placing her hand suggestively on her rear, which in Self’s perspective, is an act of self-awareness, courage, and ownership of one's body. This statement explains the explicit nature of Self's, The Function, because the expressive body language of how the avatar is glaring into the viewer suggests a direct confidence in the individual's intention, mind, and purpose. This is almost as if the viewer is pulled into the life of the avatar and thus, is able to understand the racial connotations of being a woman in a black community while maintaining a strong presence in public. The eyes in background allows the avatar to revert the gaze onto the viewer which brings to light the judgmental attitude towards women of color in public settings. ==== Bodega Run ==== Through her project of a series called Bodega Run, Self explores how bodies are affected by their environment, which also impacts the way the bodies move through the world itself. Bodegas are small grocery stores, or also known as liquor stores, that are commonly found on the east coast of America, specifically New York. Self’s inspiration for this project stems from her hometown of Harlem, where bodegas were and are very common. Self, along with many others, believes that bodegas are a place where communities come together that share mutual issues, such as the issue of the oppression of people of color in America. Her Bodega project stems from this belief and her \\"characters populating the bodegas of Harlem, these groceries of the corner, true microcosms emblems of the black and Latin diasporas in New York\\". Part of this series is her works she calls Hammer Projects include Rainbow, Big Red, My Guy, Ice Cream, and Loosie in the Park. Self also includes neon light signs, consisting of words such as “Abierto/ Open”, “Coffee/ Teas”, “EBT/ ATM”, and “Lotto”, which represent the LED lights that typically reside in these facilities. ==Recognition== Self has been named to Forbes \\"30 Under 30 List\\". She has also been recognized as a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant recipient. ==Personal life== Self currently lives in New Haven, Connecticut. ==References== ==External links== *Inside Tschabalala Self’s Complicated, Meteoric Rise through the Art Market by Alina Cohen, Artsy, November 6, 2019 Category:1990 births Category:American women painters Category:Artists from New York City Category:Bard College alumni Category:People from Harlem Category:Yale University alumni Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women artists Category:21st-century American painters Category:Painters from New York (state) ","title":"Tschabalala Self"},{"id":"56678279","text":"Information, Communication & Society is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the role of digital media in the Information Age.

After emigrating to the United States in 1956, he obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering physics from Princeton University (1959) and a PhD in theoretical physics from Cornell University (1964). In his postdoctoral years, Legéndy switched from physics to neuroscience and took a series of research positions in the US and overseas, publishing both theoretical and experimental papers. In 1985 he lost his research funding and returned to engineering, working in aerospace design (ITT Avionics, Singer-Kearfott), and in database management, until his retirement (2001). In retirement, Legéndy joined the Psychology Department at Columbia University in an unpaid position as an adjunct researcher,https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/charles-legendy and (after a 26 year hiatus in publications) resumed work in theoretical neuroscience. While in Germany, Legéndy met his future wife Annemarie; they married in 1977, and settled down to raise their children in New York City. == Physics: helicon waves == As a graduate student at Cornell, Legéndy joined an experimental team which had just discovered an electromagnetic resonance phenomenon at unexpectedly low frequencies (32 Hz and below) inside a metal sample in a magnetic field.

The test can quickly detect and quantify bursts in neuronal spike trains; and it is used, for instance, as a way to detect loss of functionality in certain brain regions. The critique of the Poisson surprise test is that actual spike distributions differ from the Poisson distribution to varying degrees (for instance for interspike intervals smaller than the refractory period); the critique generally suggests changing the underlying probability distribution, not the principle of surprise-based burst detection. The concept of surprising events in neuronal spike trains was originally introduced on theoretical grounds,Palm, G.

He was born in Lübeck on 22 September 1819 and died in Berlin on 17 January 1896.Daniel Christian Friedrich Krüger in General German Biography (ADB ), Vol. 51, pp. 404–408, publ. 1906 de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Krüger,_Daniel_Christian_Friedrich&oldid;=2785518 Retrieved Feb 2018 ==Early life== Krüger was the son of a Lübeck Senator. After attending the Lübeck Gymnasium, he studied jurisprudence at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Göttingen and completed his professional training by a long stay abroad, particularly Paris. In 1844, Krüger became a lawyer in Lübeck and was appointed procurator in the lower court and the court of appeals. Krüger's efficiency was fully acknowledged and in 1850 the city sent him as its representative to the Erfurt Union and the following year to the Elbe Ship Navigation commission in Magdeburg. After the introduction of the new constitution of Lübeck in 1849, he became the Spokesman of the Bürgerausschuss, the Committee of the House of Burgesses. ==Diplomatic service== In 1855 he became the Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic states at Copenhagen and conducted negotiations which resulted in the abolition of the Sound Dues, which had been a tax on Lübeck’s trade out from the Baltic to the open sea. By the Copenhagen Convention in 1857 this source of revenue for Denmark was bought out by Great Britain, Russia, Lübeck and the other states trading in the Baltic. The railway connections between the three Hanseatic city states were of special interest to him. At his instigation, Denmark agreed to a direct railway line across its territory in Holstein from Lübeck to Hamburg. Already in Copenhagen, he had successfully represented Hamburg's interest in the construction of a railway connecting this town to Altona (in Holstein) and concluded an agreement with the Danish government in 1860. ==Hanseatic representative to the German Confederation== The Second Schleswig War of 1864 brought an end to Krüger's activity in Copenhagen. He then took over the representation of the free cities in the Bundestag of the German Confederation at Frankfurt. On 14 June 1866 he addressed its last session, before the outbreak the Austro-Prussian War which ended that institution. At that time Schleswig and Holstein were a Prusso-Austrian condominium, with Prussia occupying the former and Austria the latter. On 8 June 1866 Prussian general Von Manteuffel crossed the river Eider into Holstein, having warned the Austrians that he was exercising Prussia’s condominate right to establish garrisons in some unoccupied points of Holstein. Austria withdrew from Holstein, but invited the Bundestag to mobilise militarily against Prussia.Overthrow of the Germanic Confederation by Prussia in 1866, by Sir Alexander Malet, former British Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Frankfort; Publ. Longmans, London 1870; pp 181-184 All three Hanseatic cities, through their envoy Krüger, voted against the Austrian proposal in the Bundestag on 14 June and jointly put a declaration formulated by Lübeck reasoning that the events in Holstein did not give rise to the mobilisation of the Confederation because the danger of an immediate collision was eliminated. However the proposal was carried. The Lübeck Senate sided with the Prussian view that the Confederation should no longer exist, because of the illegal action of mobilisation and proposed that their Bundestag envoy Krüger be recalled. Carl Merck, foreign minister of Hamburg, wanted to wait and went to see the Lübeck Senate on 19 June to persuade them of this course.“Hamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890”, by Hans-Georg Schönhoff, Publ. Hamburg, 1967; pp 13-17 On 21 June, the representatives of the Hanseatic cities met in Hamburg to discuss in detail measures which had been demanded by Prussia. The Prussian ambassador to the Hanseatic states, Emil von Richthofen, who also took part in this conference, emphasised that the abolition of all relations with Prussia's opponents was indispensable as a sign of friendly neutrality, and that therefore their Bundestag envoy in Frankfurt, Krüger, must be recalled. The meeting agreed to recall Krüger on 29 June. Richthofen now tried to persuade the Senate of Hamburg to give in to other demands, namely to send a military contingent to assist Prussia and to agree to a new close federation under Prussian hegemony. On 24 June, he visited two prominent members of the House of Burgesses (Burgerschaft), Isaac Wolffson (former President of the Burgerschaft and member of the Right party) and Johannes Halben (leader of the Left party), to inform them of the intended rejection of the Prussian proposals by the Senate. He pointed out that Prussia would not accept a refusal without further action. He mentioned that Prussia would dissolve the Senate and take over the government. The Burgerschaft would remain undisturbed, as would the population, if they kept quiet. Otherwise, 10,000 Prussian troops would occupy the city. Merck, to whom Wolffson and Halben had already reported this, sent Krüger, who had been in Hamburg since 22 June, to Richthofen to obtain certainty about the Prussian threats. At the 26 June meeting of the Hamburg Senate, Merck said that to avoid occupation of Hamburg, dissolution of the government or further coercion, it was now necessary to give way. All of northern Germany had joined Prussia, and one could not be sure what energetic steps Prussia could take.“Hamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890”, by Hans-Georg Schönhoff, Publ. Hamburg, 1967; p. 19 Krüger, still their Bundestag envoy, was not without influence on the decisions during the critical hours, and then had to return to Frankfurt to make a joint statement of the three cities. His attitude had been cautious since 16 June. Thus a milder answer to Prussia than originally proposed on 22 June was then sent.Bismarck und die norddeutschen Kleinstaaten im Jahre 1866, by Karl Lange, pPubl. C. Heymann, Berlin 1930; pp 125 and 129 ==Hanseatic Minister-Resident in Berlin== In October 1866 he was appointed Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic cities in Berlin, in succession to Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken. When the new North German Federation came into being as a result of the Austro-Prussian war, among Kruger's most important tasks was the incorporation of the free cities he represented in the new federal and imperial structures. He advised on the take-over of the military establishments, the transition of the post and telegraph system to imperial control, and especially in the organisation of new customs relations. His own city Lübeck merged into the Customs Union shortly after joining the North German Federation, along with Lübeck’s neighbours the two Mecklenburg states, while twenty years later he dealt with the Customs Union accession of Bremen and Hamburg. Shortly after his move to Berlin, he was able to inform Hamburg that the Prussian Ministry of Commerce could assist in promoting the construction of the Venlo-Hamburg railway, which Hamburg had agreed with Hanover before its annexation to Prussia. For Bremen, Krüger negotiated the territorial exchanges necessary to enable the expansion of Bremen's harbour districts. ==Federal Council (Bundesrat)== In addition to his role as Hanseatic envoy in Berlin, he was appointed Lübeck’s plenipotentiary to the new Federal Council in 1868, alongside Gustav Kirchenpauer who represented Hamburg. In the Federal Council, Kruger contributed to the Judicial Committee, maritime affairs, trade and transport, railway, post and telegraphs, Alsace- Lorraine and the construction of the Reichstag building. ==German Customs Union== He concluded the commercial treaty with the city of Hamburg by which that city entered the German Customs Union. On 25 May 1881 this agreement was signed between the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Johannes Versmann and William Henry O'Swald, and Krüger, on the other. It stated that Hamburg was ready to accede to the Customs Union with all its territory, but excluding a permanent free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 of the imperial constitution would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished or restricted without Hamburg's approval.Borowsky,Peter.

Despite the lack of funding, Rosa Bouton worked to provide a course to teach young women about the realms of domestic science. As years passed and the demand for more courses and areas of study emerged, Bouton, as the sole instructor, continued to strengthen and build the department to provide such an education to these women. == Early life == Rosa Bouton was born on 19 December 1860 in Albany, Kansas near present day Sabetha. Rosa was one of five children. Her mother was Fanny (Waldo) Bouton and her father was Eli F. Bouton. Prior to her birth, Rosa's parents had just settled in the northeast town of Kansas after traveling cross country from New York State. At the age of seven, Rosa faced the death of her mother. Her father, Eli Bouton, was an accredited school teacher and worked in education for many years. After the death of his wife in 1867, Eli soon remarried. == Education == Rosa began her studies at the State Normal School in Peru, Nebraska. After just two years, in 1881, Rosa received her teaching certificate. Her work was recognized by a professor at the State Normal School, Henry Hudson Nicholson. Following his work at the State School, Nicholson moved on to teach chemistry at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. As a consequence of Rosa's fine work, Nicholson invited Rosa to go to Nebraska with him. In 1888 Rosa enrolled in graduate school at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln and studied chemistry. Throughout her schooling years, Rosa also served as an instructor in the chemistry department. In 1891, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree and, just two years later, she also received a Master of Liberal Arts Degree. == Career == === 1893 - 1912: Early Career === Following her graduation, Rosa Bouton remained very active within the scientific community. She continued to work for the chemistry department at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL), joined the American Chemical Society in 1893 and performed research that she would later publish in 1898. Rosa was the second female member of the American Chemical Society. While a graduate student at UNL, Rosa also was employed by the chemistry department, for whom she taught classes. For several years, Rosa taught courses relating both to analytical chemistry and applied domestic chemistry. The domestic science courses covered subjects such as food analysis, sanitation, and contaminants in food. Additionally, Rosa conducted research with a fellow faculty member, Samuel Avery, at UNL and in 1898 was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on her work with phenylglutaric acids. Her focus of study was on acids alongside the effect that phenyl groups have on the properties of acids. In 1898, the University of Nebraska established a new School of Domestic Science. Along with this came the school’s request for Rosa to organize it. Rosa had spent a lot of her time expanding upon her education and in 1894, she met with Ellen Swallow. Swallow was an active leader in organizing college-level courses related to home economic, of whom Rosa learned a lot from. It was in the school's best interest to have Rosa instruct these courses due to her dedication and expertise in this area of study. Rosa accepted this offer and began her work in developing this program. She was given an initial fifteen dollars from the school to acquire appliances including tables, sinks, stoves, cupboards, and other supplies vital to teaching domestic science. While this was not enough to equip the classroom with the proper materials, Rosa also received funding from the chemistry department with the help of her colleague, Henry Nicholson. Beyond this, Rosa often spent her own money on supplies and training. The summer of 1898, after accepting her role in this department, Rosa paid for herself to travel to Boston. There, she learned more about this the field of domestic science in order to improve the effect she would have on the department and women that she would be instructing the next fall. When the school officially opened, there were eleven students enrolled. Within two years, the enrollment had increased to forty-one and at this point, Rosa was named the director of this School. In 1906, just eight years after it first opened, the School of Domestic Science grew from a two-year program to a four- year program and was later renamed the College of Home Economics. With this came training for new instructors as well. The school continued to expand as the years passed; Rosa designed a new school that would be built in 1908. She spent a lot of time researching the quality and design of already established scientific facilities when planning for this construction. Another milestone came in 1912 when the enrollment for the School of Domestic Science reached over three hundred students. By this point, the school had also hired more trained instructors who would take over for Rosa Bouton in 1912 when she was asked to step down from her position. Rosa played a very large role in the local and national Home Economics Association and had written articles that were published in both The Nebraska Teacher and The Nebraska Farmer. Her reputation was well established in Nebraska, however, at the age of fifty-one, she resigned from UNL and moved out of Nebraska. === 1916 - 1951: Later Career === From 1912 to 1916, Rosa lived in San Diego, California where she ran a small speciality bakery. After the bakery's failure, she reentered the education industry and began teaching home economics courses at a high school in a small town in Arizona, called Winkelman, for about a year. Rosa was a woman of many trades as she accepted a position to become a home demonstration agent for the Arizona Agricultural Extension Services where she served in communities, helping women and working as a nurse and counselor. At the age of seventy-four, Rosa retired and moved back to California to live with her sister, Mary Bouton. As the years passed, she continued to watch as the UNL Department of Domestic Science continued to expand and grow. Years later, after fighting a long illness, Rosa Bouton died in Pomona, California on February 15, 1951. == Legacy == Rosa’s legacy continues as she is considered a founding member of the Nebraska local section. Additionally, a women’s dormitory at UNL was named in honor of her dedication to the school and contribution to its success. == References == Category:1860 births Category:1951 deaths Category:American women chemists Category:People from Brown County, Kansas Category:University of Nebraska–Lincoln faculty Category:University of Nebraska–Lincoln alumni ","title":"Rosa Bouton"},{"id":"56678497","text":"Observatory Park may refer to: ==Australia== * Observatory Park, Brisbane, on Wickham Terrace, Spring Hill * Observatory Park, Sydney, in the Sydney central business district ==United States of America== * Goldendale Observatory State Park, in Washington * Highland Road Park Observatory, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ","title":"Observatory Park"},{"id":"56678509","text":"Following the Battle of Voronezh River in December 1237, Yuri II of Vladimir sent both of his sons with \\"all his men\\" and Voivode Yeremey to defend the fortress of Kolomna, which was on the border to the Wild Fields. == Battle == In Kolomna, the Vladimir-Suzdal army met some of the Ryazan survivors from the Battle of Voronezh River led by Prince Roman Ingvarevich. After some heavy fighting under the walls of Kolomna, the young princes Vsevolod and Vladimir retreated to Vladimir and Moscow, respectively. The small Russian force left in Kolomna was besieged and annihilated a few days after the destruction of Ryazan. This left the capital, Vladimir, open for the next Tatar onslaught. == Opposing forces == According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the contemporary historian of the Ilkhanate, Kolomna was the fiercest battle of the entire campaign: Kulkan, son of Genghis Khan, died in battle.Reasons for Mongol casualties, which were heavier than usual, might be: * Kolomna was attacked by only a fraction of Mongol force, while the main army was occupied with the siege of Ryazan. * Russian forces at Kolomna included almost all the warriors of Vladimir-Suzdal, the strongest state of Kievan Rus' at the time. The capital city of Vladimir was probably left defencless, as it was taken after just 2 days-much smaller Ryazan resisted longer, even after the defeat on the Voronezh River. Soviet historians estimated the Russian army at Kolomna up to 15.000 men. * Vladimir-Suzdal army was apparently a relief force, and Voivode Yeremey is specifically mentioned as \\"captain of the guards\\", so it is reasonable to assume that most of Grand Prince Yuri's Druzhina was there as well. So the army had a small, but well equipped core of professional soldiers. == Aftermath == According to The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan, a few days after the fall of Kolomna, the main Mongol army was suddenly attacked \\"in the land of Suzdal\\". On January 11, 1238, the last remnant of Ryazan defenders, 1700 men under Evpaty Kolovrat, made a last stand for their country.

The game takes place in 2091 and is set in a cyberpunk metropolis known as Rengkok. The player takes control of a silent, masked protagonist who attempts to rescue their kidnapped brother from a failing conglomerate, known as Heaven, that controls Rengkok. ==Synopsis== Ruiner takes place in 2091 in Rengkok and its surrounding facilities, owned by Heaven, a conglomerate led by a man referred to in-game as the Boss. Initially the player character, a silent protagonist dubbed \\"Puppy\\" by another character, is being led by a rogue hacker named Wizard to assassinate the Boss. Before he reaches the Boss's office, the signal from Wizard to the protagonist is overridden by another hacker known only as Her. Her explains to Puppy that Wizard was contracted by another group and that his brother has been kidnapped, and urges him to track Wizard down. She leads him to a territory filled with Creeps, a group of psychotic gangsters led by a swordsman named Nerve. After fighting his way through the Creeps' territory, Nerve challenges Puppy to a duel and is defeated in battle. Earning the Creeps' leadership, they find Wizard and hack into his brain, killing him in the process and leading them to the Hanza Compound, a factory that manufactures machine parts. Her tracks Puppy's brother down with a signal leading to him. They are greeted by armed guards and the angry AI that manages the compound, Mother. Puppy fights his way through the Hanza facility and fights against mercenaries hired by TrafficKing, a cyborg in the form of a UFO-like device piloted by a human head, who runs the facility alongside Mother and presumably contracted Wizard. As he follows the signal that leads to his brother, Puppy battles Mother and then TrafficKing, hacking his brain to reveal where his brother is being taken; the Imagination Farms, which use human beings as hosts to lend brainpower for running Virtuality, a virtual reality device that Heaven manufactures and sells to civilians. As TrafficKing has clearance for entering these areas, Puppy and Her kidnap him to gain access to the farms. Puppy, led by Her and accompanied by the tamed TrafficKing, scour the Imagination Farms for his brother's signal, and are confronted by Geminus, a dual-personality cyborg that presents itself as two twin sisters that act as host to Mother. TrafficKing has been working for Geminus and it has been established that they were using Wizard to form a coup to overthrow the Boss and control Heaven. TrafficKing dies after begrudgingly helping Puppy through overheated obstacles, burning to death. Puppy confronts Geminus but is attacked by the resurrected TrafficKing, now controlling a humanoid cyborg body. Puppy kills him and battles Geminus, killing both sisters and finally finding the mechanical pod that holds his brother. Upon approaching it, a cutscene showing two small children leaving the facility plays, and the game cuts back to Heaven, where Puppy is restrained in a jumpsuit as two guards and the Boss, who wears a mask identical to Puppy's, approach him. The Boss reveals that Puppy was only being used for spare parts due to their biological similarity, and that he was hacked by Wizard as he could potentially be anywhere the Boss could be. Her is an independent hacker contracted by the Boss to hack Puppy and make him believe he had a brother who was kidnapped, thus leading him back to the Boss while also exterminating the people who attempted to overthrow him. The Boss remarks that he will keep Puppy closer to him, when Her makes a reappearance and reveals that she is not human and has been tricking the Boss since their agreement; she has led Puppy to Heaven to kill the Boss. Her advises Puppy to 'meet her where heaven falls' if he survives. He escapes his restraints and kills many of the Boss's guards before finally approaching the Boss himself, and, depending on a dialogue prompt, will either bludgeon him with his weapon or hack his brain. The ending shows Puppy riding away on his motorcycle to an unknown destination. ==Development and release== Ruiner was developed by Polish indie game studio Reikon Games and published by Devolver Digital. The game was released for Linux, PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One on 26 September 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on June 18, 2020. ==Reception== Critical reception towards Ruiner was generally positive. Omri Pettite of PC Gamer stated that \\"Ruiner is gorgeous, a sensory feast inspired by the works of cyberpunk's 1980s heyday, in which a silent, masked protagonist travels through the nightscapes and industrial jungles of a grit-tech 2091. Underneath, a thumping top-down action game delivers sword-sharp combat, the familiarity of its design offset by the constant urge to simply stand still and drink everything in.\\" In his review for both the game and Cuphead, Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation said he didn't like Ruiner because it felt like \\"a cyberpunk ripoff of Hotline Miami with none of what made Hotline Miami interesting [...] Yeah, the fights were hard, but I wasn't getting that all-important sense of payoff; all I felt I was \\"earning\\" was more chances to fight boring gang members in murky environments.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Shooter video games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:Video games developed in Poland Category:2017 video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Dystopian video games Category:Single- player video games ","title":"Ruiner (video game)"},{"id":"56678578","text":"During the 1910–11 season Hearts competed in the Scottish First Division, the Scottish Cup and the East of Scotland Shield. ==Fixtures== ===Dunedin Cup=== ===North Eastern Cup=== ===East of Scotland Cup=== ===Rosebery Charity Cup=== ===Scottish Cup=== ===Scottish First Division=== ==See also== *List of Heart of Midlothian F.C. seasons ==References== *Statistical Record 10-11 ==External links== *Official Club website Category:Heart of Midlothian F.C. seasons Heart of Midlothian ","title":"1910–11 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season"},{"id":"56678588","text":"Santa Cruz (Tubajon) (not to be confused with Santa Cruz, (San Jose), is one of 9 Barangays of the municipality of Tubajon, Dinagat Islands, Philippines.

Her memoir Educated (2018) debuted at #1 on The New York Times bestseller list and was a finalist for a number of national awards, including the LA Times Book Prize, PEN America's Jean Stein Book Award, and two awards from the National Book Critics Circle Award. The New York Times ranked Educated as one of the 10 Best Books of 2018. Because of her book, Westover was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019. == Early life and education == Westover was the youngest of seven children born in Clifton, Idaho (population 259) to Mormon survivalist parents. She has five older brothers and an older sister. Her parents were suspicious of doctors, hospitals, public schools, and the federal government. Westover was born at home, delivered by a midwife, and was never taken to a doctor or nurse. She was not registered for a birth certificate until she was nine years old. Their father resisted getting formal medical treatment for any of the family. Even when seriously injured, the children were treated only by their mother, who had studied herbalism and other methods of alternative healing. All the siblings were loosely homeschooled by their mother. Westover has said an older brother taught her to read, and she studied the scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to which her family belonged. But she never attended a lecture, wrote an essay, or took an exam. There were few textbooks in their house. As a teenager, Westover began to want to enter the larger world and attend college. She purchased textbooks and studied independently in order to score well on the ACT Exam. She gained admission to Brigham Young University and was awarded a scholarship, although she had no high school diploma. After a difficult first year, in which Westover struggled to adjust to academia and the wider society there, she became more successful and graduated with honors in 2008. She subsequently earned a Master's degree from the University of Cambridge at Trinity College as a Gates Cambridge Scholar, and was a visiting fellow at Harvard University in 2010. She returned to Trinity College, Cambridge, where she earned a doctorate in intellectual history in 2014. Her thesis is entitled \\"The Family, Morality and Social Science in Anglo-American Cooperative Thought, 1813–1890\\". In 2009, while a graduate student at Cambridge, Westover told her parents that for many years (since age 15), she had been physically and psychologically abused by an older brother. Her parents denied her account and suggested that Westover was under the influence of Satan. The family split over these events. Westover wrote about the estrangement, and her unusual path to and through university education in her 2018 memoir, Educated. Westover was Fall 2019 A.M. Rosenthal Writer in Residence at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard Kennedy School. She was selected as a Senior Research Fellow at HKS for Spring 2020. ===Educated: A Memoir=== In 2018, Penguin Random House published Westover's Educated: A Memoir, which tells the story of her struggle to reconcile her desire for education and autonomy with her family's rigid ideology and isolated life. The coming-of-age story was a #1 New York Times bestseller, and was positively reviewed by the New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, USA Today, Vogue, and The Economist, among others. , Educated has spent two years in hardcover on the New York Times bestseller list and is being translated into 45 languages. The book was voted the #1 Library Reads pick by American librarians, and in August 2019, it had been checked out more frequently than any other book through all New York Public Library's 88 branches. As of March 2020, Educated has sold more than 4 million copies. Through their attorney, the family has disputed some elements of Westover's book, including her suggestion that her father has bipolar disorder and that her mother suffered a brain injury that resulted in reduced motor skills. Blake Atkin, a lawyer representing Westover's parents, claims that Educated creates a distorted picture of the parents. Westover has not responded directly to these claims, but notes in the acknowledgements that prior to publication, the book was professionally fact- checked by Ben Phelan of This American Life and GQ. == Awards and recognition == Westover's book earned her several awards and accolades: * Named the Book of the Year by the American Booksellers Association * Finalist for the John Leonard Prize from the National Book Critics Circle * Finalist for the Autobiography Award from the National Book Critics Circle * Finalist for the LA Times Book Prize in Biography * Finalist for PEN/America's Jean Stein Award * Finalist for the American Booksellers Association Audiobook of the Year Award * Finalist for Barnes & Noble's Discover Great Writers Award * One of the New York Times' 10 Best Books of 2018 * Long-listed for the Carnegie Medal of Excellence * Winner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Autobiography * Winner of the Audie Award for Autobiography/Memoir * Alex Award from the American Library Association * Named an 'Amazing Audiobook for Young Adults' by the American Library Association * Amazon Editors' pick for the Best Book of 2018 * Apple's Best Memoir of the Year * Audible's Best Memoir of the Year * Hudson Group Best Book of the Year * President Barack Obama's pick for summer reading and his Favorite Books of the Year list * Bill Gates's Holiday Reading list * Westover chosen by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019 * Educated named one of the Best Books of the year by The Washington Post, Oprah Magazine, Time, NPR, Good Morning America, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Guardian, The Economist, The Financial Times, The New York Post, The Skimm, Bloomberg, Real Simple, Town & Country, Bustle, Publishers Weekly, The Library Journal, Book Riot, and the New York Public Library. * Featured speaker, Seattle Arts & Lectures, 2019 ==References== ==External links== * *Tara Westover, After Words, C-SPAN Category:American memoirists Category:American women memoirists Category:21st-century memoirists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American historians Category:American women historians Category:Survivalism in the United States Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Writers from Idaho Category:1986 births Category:Living people ","title":"Tara Westover"},{"id":"56678649","text":"Thomas Eagar 'Tommy' Sears (1911-1975), was a male English international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won a silver medal in the men's team event at the 1931 World Table Tennis Championships.

The majority of industrialized and some developing countries have formally established advisory committees to guide immunization policies; other countries are working towards establishment of such committees. NITAG in each country may have different names, for example: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the United Kingdom, Standing Committee on Vaccination (Ständige Impfkommission am Robert-Koch-Institut / STIKO) in Germany, Technical Committee of Vaccination (Comité Technique des Vaccinations / CTV) in France, National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada, and National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in India. ==Purpose== The primary purpose of NITAG is to provide technical resources, supplying guidance and recommendations to national policy makers and programme managers to enable them to make evidence-based immunization related policy and program decisions. This may also include vaccination schedules regarding appropriate timing, dosage, and contraindications of vaccines. To ensure that the government gives proper attention to NITAG recommendations, NITAG usually report to high level officials of the Ministry of Health. NITAG are considered to be functional when they meet six defined process indicators agreed upon by the World Health Organization (WHO), which are: # having a legislative or administrative basis, # having formal terms of reference, # having at least five areas of expertise represented among its membership, # having at least one meeting per year, # distribution of the agenda and background documents at least one week prior to meetings, and # having mandatory disclosure of conflict of interests. As of January 2020, there are 151 countries reporting existence of NITAG and 134 countries with NITAG with all six WHO functionality criteria. ==Members== There are no fixed rules about the total number of NITAG members as it depends on local considerations such as the need for geographic representation, the size of the country, and the availability of resources. However, experience has shown that successful NITAG function with about 10–15 members. NITAG members typically consist of multidisciplinary experts and represent a broad range of skills and expertise from the following disciplines/areas: clinical medicine (paediatrics and adolescent medicine, adult medicine, geriatrics), epidemiologists, infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists, public health, immunology, vaccinology, immunization programme, health systems and delivery, clinical research and health economics. ==See also== * Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, NITAG in the United States * Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, NITAG in the United Kingdom * Standing Committee on Vaccination, NITAG in Germany ==References== ==External links== * NITAG Resource Center page Category:Vaccination-related organizations ","title":"National Immunization Technical Advisory Group"},{"id":"56678660","text":"The Tard-Venus pillage Grammont in 1362, from Froissart's Chronicles.

He has also studied how people convey and perceive sexuality through phonetic variation. In research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2018, he revealed that the voices of boys and girls were identifiably different even before puberty with the boys' voices being lower and boys that were gender dysphoric showing traits more associated with women.

Smith, the son of the prosperous Boston merchant Isaac Smith Sr. and Elizabeth Storer Smith, was born May 18, 1749. At the age of fourteen he entered Harvard College with the class of 1767. After taking his second degree, and preparing for the ministry, he traveled in Europe for some years. Returning to this country, he was appointed, in 1774, a tutor at Harvard, but the position he was not destined to hold long. Smith was a firm loyalist, and when on April 19, 1775, Lord Percy marched through Cambridge to reinforce the British troops at Lexington and Concord, the young tutor was the only person in Cambridge willing to show the puzzled leader, confused by the number of roads branching off from the Boston Common, which one to take for Lexington. Being for this service to the enemy almost ostracized by the good people of Cambridge, he was glad to sail a month later for England with many other exiled loyalists. After living a few years in London, he was ordained (June 24, 1778) pastor over a dissenting church in the little town of Sidmouth in Devonshire. Of his pleasant life there, in a comfortable home, with congenial society and light parish duties, we get glimpses in the published Journal and letters of his fellow exile, Samuel Curwen. In the spring of 1784, resigning his pastorate, he returned to America. In August 1787, Smith was appointed Librarian of Harvard College, although he did not sign the formal engagement until the next March. In May 1789, the Harvard Corporation allowed him £13.13s. \\"for instructing the classes in Latin for six weeks and an half in the third term, three times a day, being seven dollars per week.\\" The third printed catalogue of the Library appeared the next year: Catalogus Bibliothecae Harvardianas Cantabrigiae Nov- Anglorum. Bostoniae : Typis Thomas et Johannis Fleet. MDCCXC. The Latin preface says: \\"Ut ista omnibus, qui ei consulere velint, utilior fieret, libri alphabetice sub diversis capitibus, secundum propria eorum genera, in hoc catalogo disponuntur.\\" The first, or general, part of the catalogue is divided into fifty-four classes in alphabetical order, and the books under each are also alphabetically arranged. About one fourth of the titles are under \\"Theologia\\"; yet the names of Shakespeare, Milton, Ben Johnson, Pope, The Tatler, The Spectator, Racine, Rabelais, and Cervantes show that polite literature was not wholly neglected. In the second part of the catalogue, which is devoted to \\"Tracts,\\" out of 150 pages, theology occupies over 100. In the preparation of this catalogue Smith had the aid of Prof. Stephen Sewall, (Librarian 1762–63) and Hezekiah Packard (class of 1787). The latter was an assistant in the Library; in his memoirs he says: \\"The next year [1789] I took charge of the Library as an assistant.\\" For his services in preparing this catalogue Smith was allowed by the Corporation in April 1791, the sum of £37.10s. in addition to his regular salary. In April 1790, the trustees of Dummer Academy, at Byfield, Massachusetts, elected Isaac Smith preceptor of that institution, but it was nearly a year before he entered on his duties there, March 25, 1791. The Academy was not successful under his management; his good nature and easy-going ways were not those of a good teacher or a strict disciplinarian; the school fell off greatly in numbers, and it was not strange that, in April 1809, the trustees accepted his resignation. He removed to Boston where he was appointed chaplain of the Almshouse, a position which he held for many years. He was never married, and died in Boston on September 29 or 30, 1829, at the age of 80. One of his scholars, writing years afterward, recalls him as \\"a short, nice, rubicund, but kindly and scholarly- looking old gentleman.\\" \\"In spirit\\" says another writer, \\"he was mild and tolerant ; in creed, broad and liberal.\\" He was \\"a man of singular purity, gentleness, and piety.\\" Besides the Catalogue mentioned above, his only publication seems to be A sermon preached at Cambridge, May 5th, 1788 on occasion of the death of Mr. Ebenezer Grosvenor, student at Harvard. ==References== ==External links== *Smith-Carter Family Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society * Category:American librarians Category:1749 births Category:1829 deaths Category:Harvard College Loyalists in the American Revolution Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Harvard University librarians Category:American Loyalists from Massachusetts ","title":"Isaac Smith Jr."},{"id":"56678919","text":"Corey Antonio Barlow (born November 1, 1970) is a former American football defensive back who played for three seasons in the National Football League (NFL), one season in the World League of American Football (WLAF), and one season in the Arena Football League (AFL).

It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. ==History== Eyre's Peninsula Tribune was founded in December 1910, with the first issue released on 10 March 1911. The newspaper was founded in Cowell by Charles Wallace, and after his death in 1912 it was managed by George Wallace, and in 1920 it was sold to E.R. Main. In 1941, during wartime rationing, it subsumed the Kimba Dispatch (2 September 1927 - 9 May 1941), which had been founded as a subsidiary by Main. On Thursday 15 May 1941, a subtitle (with which is incorporated the Kimba \\"Dispatch.\\") was added, but in January 1951, the title was simplified to Eyre Peninsula Tribune. After Main's death in 1959, the Tribune was taken over by the Port Lincoln Times, who also owned the Areas Express (1959-1960), combining the two under the Tribune title. In 1963, R.C. Braund of the Port Lincoln Times assumed sole control the newspaper, and In 1982 it was taken over by Northern Newspapers Pty Ltd (winning the Ampol Award for the best country newspaper in Australia, with a circulation of under 5,000 the same year).

Mputu constructs projects using interactive media, video, sculpture and installation. == Background == Mputu is a first generation Congolese American, and is currently based out of Orlando, FL. Mputu first began working creatively with technology during high school by journaling, writing poetry, curating content on Tumblr, editing Myspace photos and making lip sync videos on Youtube. Mputu dropped out of DePaul University and then went to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for a semester while studying performance art. In 2016, Mputu was working as a freelance Social Media Marketer while also selling artwork. == Selected works == === TeachMeTeaseMe === TeachMeTeaseMe was a Facebook group created by Mputu. It is archived on Tumblr at (https://teachmeteaseme.tumblr.com/).

The worlds explored include the realities of a police state that has weaponized surveillance, as well as the reactions of a public that rebels against it. Broken Windows is a look into how these groups of people are then subject to further violence that can at times be lethal on both sides. For example, the police raids and the civil riots that challenge those tactics. === LVLZ Healing Center=== LVLZ Healing Center is an installation that Mputu created and was displayed at Interstitial in Georgetown/Seattle, WA. This installation was Mputu’s first physical art piece, since all of Mputu’s previous work was digital. The space was divided into four “portals of healing” which all encompass an “art therapy pod”. Each pod is meant to simulate and represent another space. For example, “Pod 1: Welcome Center,” “Pod 2: Level A” is a waiting room, “Pod 3: Level O” is a media and learning center, and “Pod 4: Level Zed” is an apothecary. The whole exhibition uses “video, interactive media, sculpture, and installation… [to] reconstruct our notions of well being”. === Cyber Serenity === Cyber Serenity is a project created by Mputu that targets those who need therapeutic attention.

He worked with Thomas J. Durant, who was also involved with politics and the causes of freedmen and social reform. Louisiana History describes Mr. Hornor as among the leading white radicals, Radical Republicans, in New Orleans at the time. Hornor represented Thomas J. Allen in a case before the U.S. Supreme court. He introduced the first female lawyer to ever appear before the U.S. Supreme Court.He received a letter of support from residents in New York for nomination to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court after the 1865 death of John Catron. The vacant seat was eliminated by congress to prevent Democrat Andrew Johnson, who became president after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, from filling the seat. ==Early years== Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Charles West Hornor descended from an established Quaker family which arrived in 1683 as part of William Penn’s fleet of Quaker settlers. Hornor’s grandfather, Benjamin Hornor, was a founding member of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1784. Quaker moral values were deeply instilled in his family. Charles West Hornor was born in 1813 to Joseph Potts Hornor and Jane West. After attending schools in Philadelphia, he studied at Nazareth Hall in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, a Moravian boarding school. To his disappointment, he was withdrawn from school at age 16, and put to work in a wholesale dry goods house. At that young age, he already had his sights on becoming a lawyer. After several years, he joined a brokerage firm, experienced the volatility of the market, and finally, in 1836, relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, to clerk in a bank. New Orleans was becoming the nation’s third largest city and the hub of growing Mississippi River trade. After working in the bank, he moved to an insurance company where he was able to study law under the company’s attorney. He was made an attorney in 1842 at the age of 29. Hornor married Mary Ellen Talman of New York City, New York, in 1835 and had two children before Mrs. Hornor died of Yellow Fever in 1841. He married Sarah Elizabeth Smith in 1850 with whom he had eight more children. ==Career== Once a member of the Bar, Hornor formed a partnership with fellow Philadelphian Thomas J. Durant. They practiced commercial law together in New Orleans until the close of the Civil War. Immediately after the war, Durant moved to Washington DC while Hornor moved to Philadelphia. Hornor joined Durant in Washington DC in 1872, where he practiced law, including trying cases before the Supreme Court, until an advanced age. Charles W Hornor had a lively intellect and after retirement, occupied himself pursuits as varied as studying medicine and translating Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s Lectures on Aesthetics from German to English. Alice Lee Moqué was his daughter with his second wife. His grandson was the chemist Walter O. Snelling and his great- grandson was Richard A.

In February 1993, personnel of the guard of honor took 24-hour protection under of the national flag and coat of arms in the Palace of the Republic.https://tengrinews.kz/fotoarchive/prezidentskiy-polk-kto-neset- pochetnyiy-karaul-1062/amp/ In 2015, the Soviet Victory Banner was brought to Nur-Sultan (then Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan) to be trooped through Kazakh Eli Square by personnel of the regiment in the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade on 7 May. ===Foreign visits=== In July 1997, the servicemen of the regiment and the Presidential Band went on a tour to Malaysia at the invitation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, presenting Kazakh culture and combat art there. In September 2006, the guardsmen were invited to the Russian capital for the celebrations of Moscow City Day, coming back a year later where they took part in the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo. ===Public figure=== The official regimental uniform is a white and aqua tunic for officers and a blue tunic for soldiers.

These voters comprise roughly 13% of Trump voters and 9% of Obama voters. In contrast, 7% of Obama voters did not vote in 2016, and 3% voted for a third party candidate. While some analysts consider these voters to have been decisive in Trump's victory, others have disputed this conclusion. According to research done by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, compared to other voters, Obama-Trump voters have progressive economic views and conservative social views, and though these voters supported Trump in the 2016 election, they are less supportive of Republicans as a whole, and show a desire to change the status quo. == Studies == Various studies estimate the percentage of Trump voters who had previously voted for Obama at between 11 and 15 percent. The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) found that 11% of Trump voters had voted for Obama in 2012, with the American National Election Study putting the number at 13%, and the University of Virginia Center for Politics estimating 15%. Expressed in total number of voters, these percentages indicate that between 7 and 9 million Trump voters voted for Obama in 2012. According to a May 2017 McClatchy news report, an analysis by Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group estimated that Obama-Trump voters accounted for more than two-thirds of Obama voters who did not vote for Hillary Clinton. == Significance == Some analysts have argued that Obama-Trump voters had a disproportionately large impact on the 2016 election because they were concentrated in key swing states in the Midwest while others have said they were actually \\"Obama Republicans\\" rather than Democrats to begin with. Some have disputed both the quantity and the significance of Obama-Trump voters in deciding the outcome of the 2016 election. Dana Milbank argued in an August 2017 Washington Post column that the number of such voters was initially overstated and that most of them were Republicans who only defected from their party to vote for Obama, not Democrats who defected to support Trump. Nate Cohn countered Milbank's assessment by arguing that Milbank's focus on national data obscured the magnitude of Democratic defection to support Trump. Cohn noted that when looking specifically at white Obama voters with no higher education than a high school diploma, Clinton won only 74% (based on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group) or 78% (based on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study). == Voters' views == Shortly before the 2016 election, The New York Times reported that Obama voters who planned to vote for Trump felt he embodied the \\"change\\" they had hoped for when they voted for Obama. Multiple focus groups of Obama-Trump voters convened by the Roosevelt Institute and Democracy Corps in early 2017 showed that in general these voters wanted to change the status quo and had skeptical views of Congressional Republicans and their proposals. The same focus groups also indicated that these voters hoped President Trump would help reduce health care costs for working-class Americans, and that they were anxious about some immigrant groups. A multi-year survey completed by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group found that Obama-Trump voters generally had liberal views on economic issues, but conservative views on social issues. In a 2017 editorial for New York Magazine, Eric Levitz noted that data from the CCES indicates 75% of Obama-Trump voters supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. According to an article in Politico, a September 2017 Democracy Fund Voter Study Group poll found that 70% of Obama-Trump voters approved of the job Trump was doing as president. This figure was significantly lower than the 88% approval rating among all Trump voters. Similarly, the percent of voters who disapproved of Trump's performance in this poll was much higher among Obama-Trump voters (22%) than among Trump voters as a whole (9%). == See also == * List of Democrats who opposed the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign * Reagan Democrats * Sanders-Trump voters == References == * Trump voters Category:Donald Trump Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign Category:Political terminology of the United States Category:Voting in the United States ","title":"Obama-Trump voters"},{"id":"56679601","text":"Colin Lingwood Mallows (born 10 September 1930, Great Sampford, Essex) is an English statistician, who has worked in the United States since 1960.

In 1966, he became a college head coach and athletic director at College, an NAIA program in Canton, Missouri. Trumbo moved back west to northern California in 1970 to Sonoma State in Rohnert Park as athletic director, and added basketball coaching duties after the Cossacks went in 1972, winless in a dozen conference games. Under Trumbo, Sonoma State was overall in 1973 with ten conference wins, and went the following season. The basketball program was dropped in 1974 for financial reasons and Trumbo departed for nearby Santa Rosa Junior College and was the head coach for nine seasons, posting a record with seven ===Idaho=== Moving up to Division I, Trumbo was hired at resurgent Idaho in April 1983, replacing Don Monson, a charismatic alumnus from Coeur d'Alene who departed after five seasons for Oregon in the Pac-10 Conference. The Vandals had been a last place team in the Big Sky Conference for five straight seasons in the late 1970s, but rose to second in 1980 and then won consecutive conference titles (regular season and tournament) in 1981 and 1982. The latter finished the regular season at with a #6 ranking in both and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. The 1983 team slipped back slightly, but was in the regular season and was invited to the NIT, a first for the Big Sky. In Monson's last four seasons, the best stretch in program history, Idaho was at home, with a home winning streak; attendance had twice topped 11,000 in the Kibbie Dome during the 1983 season. As an outsider following a hero, Trumbo recognized that his task in Moscow to continue the recent success would be with less talent and experience, Idaho slipped back into the Big Sky cellar in 1984 and attendance His teams went overall ( in conference) and he was relieved of his duties after three seasons in succeeded by an assistant under hall of fame head coach Don Haskins at ==Later career== Returning to lower profile programs, Trumbo was later the athletic director at Hawaii–Hilo (1990–2000), Cal State–Monterey Bay (2000–2006), Diablo Valley College (interim, and back on Hawaii (Big Island) at Konawaena High School from 2009 At Monterey Bay, he was also the basketball coach for his final three Trumbo died in Kona at age 79 in 2018 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. ==Head coaching record== ===College=== ==References== ==External links== * Sports-Reference.com - Bill Trumbo Category:1939 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Kentucky Category:Basketball players from Kentucky Category:Chapman Panthers baseball players Category:Chapman Panthers men's basketball coaches Category:Chapman Panthers men's basketball players Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Culver–Stockton Wildcats men's basketball coaches Category:High school basketball coaches in the United States Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball coaches Category:Junior college men's basketball coaches in the United States Category:Sonoma State Seawolves athletic directors Category:Sonoma State Seawolves men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Forwards (basketball) ","title":"Bill Trumbo"},{"id":"56680374","text":"Emmy Murphy is an American mathematician and an associate professor at Northwestern University who works in the area of symplectic topology, contact geometry and geometric topology. ==Education== Murphy graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 2007, the first in her family to earn a college degree.

Murphy was invited to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018 and she gave a talk related to some results on h-principle phenomena. Apart from using h-principle to study the flexibility of local geometric models, Murphy's work uses cut-and-paste/surgery techniques from smooth topology. She also works on exploring the interaction of symplectic/contact topology with geometric invariants, such as those coming from pseudo-holomorphic curves or constructible sheaves.

It is headquartered at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. The wing is also the parent organization for the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), a geographically separated unit (GSU) located at NAS Pensacola, Florida. The wing is also the parent organization for the 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG), a geographically separated unit (GSU) located at The United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. The 12 FTW is the only unit in the Air Force conducting both pilot instructor training and combat systems officer training. The wing's predecessor unit, the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, fought in combat during the Vietnam War and was the host unit at two major air bases in South Vietnam. Its McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft flew thousands of combat missions between 1965 and 1971 before being withdrawn as part of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Its World War II predecessor unit, the 12th Bombardment Group, as part of Twelfth Air Force, supported the Allied drive from Egypt to Tunisia during the North Africa Campaign, then reassigned to Tenth Air Force in India and flew most of its missions in Burma between April 1944 and May 1945, supporting the British Fourteenth Army. The commander of the 12th Flying Training Wing is Col Mark S. Robinson. The Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Tony Goldstrom. ==1990s== In 1992, due to the impending closure of Mather Air Force Base, California, the 12 FTW also assumed responsibility for Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) and Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT) from the 323d Flying Training Wing (323 FTW) at Mather when that organization inactivated, with most T-43A aircraft and some of the 323 FTW squadrons reforming at Randolph AFB under the 12 FTW. In 2009, with the transition of UNT to undergraduate Combat Systems Officer training (UCSOT) and pursuant to earlier Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) directives, the 12 FTW established a new organization, the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), with two new flying training squadrons and an operations support squadron, as a GSU at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Although NAS Pensacola is the principal base for student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) training for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the 479 FTG operates independently of this program with its own USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. Upon establishment of the 479 FTG at NAS Pensacola, the remaining \\"legacy\\" navigator training squadrons that had relocated from the former Mather AFB to Randolph AFB in 1992 were inactivated. ===The 2010s=== In the second decade of the 21st century, the wing's mission is to provide instructor pilot training in the Raytheon-Beech T-6A Texan II, the Northrop T-38 Talon and the Beech T-1A Jayhawk jet trainers. Previously, the wing also conducted Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) in the Northrop AT-38 Talon, a role now performed with T-38s. Until late 2010, the wing also conducted Joint Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (JSUNT) and electronic warfare officer (EWO) training in the T-1A Jayhawk and Boeing T-43A medium-range turbofan jet at Randolph AFB. With the retirement of the T-43 in September 2010, this training merged with extant USAF weapons systems officer (WSO) training that had been conducted jointly with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida since 1990. The navigator, EWO and WSO training tracks were then merged and all three specialties (which wear the same type of uniform insignia wings upon completion of flight training) became known as Combat Systems Officer (CSO). This updated CSO training is now conducted by the 479th Flying Training Group as a Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) of the 12 FTW at NAS Pensacola utilizing T-6 Texan II and T-1A Jayhawk aircraft.Air Force Times, 22 November 2010, p. 20 The wing is responsible for numerous aviation training programs. These programs include Pilot Instructor Training, Combat Systems Officer Training, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Pilot Indoctrination, Basic Sensor Operator Qualification, Airmanship programs for U.S. Air Force Academy cadets, and Introductory Flight Screening. ===Units in the 2010s=== The wing consists of three flying groups and a maintenance directorate spanning more than 1,600 miles from JBSA-Randolph, Texas to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, to Pueblo Memorial Airport and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. The 12th Operations Group controls all Instructor Pilot Training and airfield operations at Randolph AFB and Randolph AFB Auxiliary Field/Seguin Field. The 479th Flying Training Group is a geographically separated unit located at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and conducts Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training. The 306th Flying Training Group is a geographically separated unit located at the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. The 306 FTG conducts powered flight training, soaring, and parachute training for Air Force Academy cadets. * 12th Operations Group ** 99th Flying Training Squadron (99 FTS) ** 435th Fighter Training Squadron (435 FTS) ** 558th Flying Training Squadron (558 FTS) ** 559th Flying Training Squadron (559 FTS) ** 560th Flying Training Squadron (560 FTS) * 306th Flying Training Group ** 1st Flying Training Squadron (1 FTS) ** 94th Flying Training Squadron (94 FTS) ** 98th Flying Training Squadron (98 FTS) ** 557th Flying Training Squadron (557 FTS) * 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG) ** 451st Flying Training Squadron (451 FTS) ** 455th Flying Training Squadron (455 FTS) ==Lineage== * Established as 12th Fighter- Escort Wing on 27 October 1950 : Activated on 1 November 1950 : Redesignated: 12th Strategic Fighter Wing on 20 January 1953 : Redesignated: 12 Fighter-Day Wing on 1 July 1957 : Inactivated on 8 January 1958 * Redesignated 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, and activated, on 17 April 1962 : Organized on 25 April 1962 : Inactivated on 17 November 1971 * Redesignated 12th Flying Training Wing on 22 March 1972 : Activated on 1 May 1972 by transfer of personnel and equipment from the 3510th Flying Training Wing ==Assignments== * Second Air Force, 1 November 1950 * Eighth Air Force, 5 December 1950 * 42d Air Division, 9 April 1951 – 8 January : Attached to 7th Air Division, 20 July – 30 November 1951 : Attached to 39th Air Division, 18 May – 10 August 1953;

It existed from 1924 until 1991, and was previously known as the Federation of Salaried Officers of Railways Commissioners (1924–1947) and the Australasian Transport Officers Federation (1947–1978). The union had a policy of supporting conciliation and arbitration and against strike action until 1970. ==History== The Federation was formed in 1924 through the merger of the Railway and Tramway Officers' Association, based in NSW, and the Victorian Railways Administrative Officers' and Clerks' Association. The NSW body had been founded in 1913, while Victorian association had been registered in February 1921 following a High Court decision that gave workers in \\"state instrumentalities\\" access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The association sought to represent the interests of railway officers as distinct from railway workers more broadly. The association sought to form a national union and formed agreements with similar unions in other states, which applied for federal registration as the Federation of Salaried Officers of Railways Commissioners. It met fierce opposition from the union movement, resulting in the case lingering before the industrial registrar for three years. The union argued that a separate union was necessary because officers in responsible positions having to be part of a general organisation would \\"result in a complete subversion of discipline\\" and the Australian Railways Union was \\"inclined to support affiliations with which responsible officers should not be associated\\". The union was eventually registered federally in September 1924 and was headquartered in Sydney. O. A. Meyer, the president of the NSW Railway and Tramway Officers' Association, became the union's president, while P. Hunt was general secretary. In November 1925, when it held its first triennial conference, it had 5300 members in New South Wales, 1000 in South Australia and 850 in Victoria, and were attempting to convince state organisations in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia to join. The union spoke openly about what they viewed as their need to remain non-political and non-partisan because of their \\"duty to comply with the directions and tender loyal service to whatever Government might be in power\\". The union initially barred women from joining, objecting to women being appointed to positions that had been previously occupied by men. In 1928 announced its opposition to the employment of women for other than mechanical office work, and in 1931 it advocated female typists being fired before male clerks faced further rationing. In the mid-1930s, the union began campaigning for an that appointments and promotions should be determined by an appointments board with an independent chairman, in response to widespread discontent with the process then in use. The union adamantly opposed strike action in the 1946 Victorian railway strike, and claimed to have recruited new members from the Australian Railways Union in the aftermath. In 1947, the union renamed itself the Australasian Transport Officers' Federation and sought to expand its coverage to include air, road and railway employees, although membership at first remained constitutionally limited to \\"transport officers of the Crown. In August 1947, the union established a Tasmanian branch for the first time. The union initially remained limited to representing railway officers; however, in 1948 it began breaking into the airline industry, establishing a Trans Australia Airlines special branch to deal with the new members. The broadening of the union's coverage met with opposition from the Federated Clerks' Union. It would also later extend to include Qantas employees. In 1950, the union wavered on its opposition to strike action, with the SA branch resolving to consider it if an appeals board were not instituted, and in Victoria in protest at non-striking members being stood down without pay during other unions' strike action; however, no action was taken. In 1970, the union finally broke with its policy against strike action, with both Victorian and NSW railway members taking industrial action in response to disputes in their states, repeated again several times during the 1970s and 1980s, although the union was still seen as more conservative than the ARU. In 1979, the union placed a \\"black ban\\" on independent NSW state MP John Hatton after he called for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the transport department, resulting in a parliamentary resolution rebuking the union and an end to the ban. In 1990, following the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute, four airlines sought orders that their pilots be covered by the Transport Officers Federation, rather than the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, the union which had gone on strike the previous year. In April 1991, the Transport Officers' Federation voted to merge with the Municipal Officers Association of Australia and the Technical Service Guild of Australia to form the Australian Municipal Transport Energy Water Ports Community & Information Services Union. The amalgamated union, which took effect from 1 July 1991, was often known as the Australian Services Union, and later formed the modern Australian Services Union after a series of mergers with other unions. ==References== Category:Defunct trade unions of Australia Category:Railway unions in Australia ","title":"Australian Transport Officers' Federation"},{"id":"56680512","text":"Lady Camilla Bloch QC ( Bingham; born 30 June 1970) is a British barrister.

The trophy is made in Chile, by a local company called Broncerías Chile. == Antorcha de Plata == The Antorcha de Plata (') was usually the first prize given to an artist at the request of the public during his presentation.

It was a major inspiration for the modern environmentalist movement. ==Summary== Road to Survival is a summary of the ecological status of the world. Vogt documented the negative effects of an expanding global population on the environment. He gathered reports of deforestation, gullying, overgrazing, soil erosion and many forms of destruction of fundamental resources which has arisen from the greed and ignorance of mankind. Vogt argued that since food production cannot keep pace with the increase in world population, the only solution is universal birth control. Vogt attacks capitalism, and describes United States history as a \\"march of destruction\\". The book is filled with scientific data, and its world-wide scope was unusual at the time. Ultimately, the book advocates population control as the only way to prevent environmental disaster. Human population could not exceed the planet's carrying capacity without disaster. ==Reception== The book was commercially successful. A condensed version was published in Reader's Digest, and many universities used the book as a textbook. However, his message was attacked by ideologues of all varieties, by conservatives for opposing capitalism and supporting birth control, and by liberals as proof of \\"science's bankruptcy in the face of pressing modern problems\\". A 1949 review in the Geography journal concluded that \\"the survey of the causes and consequences of soil erosion in the several regions of the world is a valuable one and although many will quarrel with the author's political and ethical views the thesis presents a challenge that will be a great stimulus to thinking about some of the big issues presented.\\" Later on, the book would inspire the modern environmental movement, with both Rachel Carson and Paul Ehrlich being inspired by it. ==See also== * Our Plundered Planet ==References== Category:Environmental non-fiction books Category:1948 non-fiction books Category:1948 in the environment ","title":"Road to Survival"},{"id":"56680801","text":"Sialkot is a city in Punjab, Pakistan.

The slogan for the book is, \\"Darcy writes the words. Lizzie lives them.\\" ==Plot== Darcy Patel has put college and everything else on hold to move to New York to rewrite and publish her teen novel, 'Afterworlds'. Arriving with no apartment or friends she wonders whether she's made the right decision, until she falls in with a crowd of other seasoned and fledgling writers who take her under their wings. Darcy weathers on through the whirlwind that is a first publication and learns multiple lessons not just in YA writing, but also in romance and relationships. Told in alternating chapters is Darcy's novel, a suspenseful thriller about Lizzie, a teen who slips into the Afterworld to survive a terrorist attack. Upon venturing into the underworld, Lizzie meets another mortal afterlife transcender who has been in the Afterworld for thousands of years and attempts to support Lizzie’s transition as a psychopomp. But the Afterworld is a place between the living and the dead, and as Lizzie drifts between our world and that of the Afterworld, she discovers that many unsolved - and terrifying - stories need to be reconciled. ==Characters== ===Darcy's Story=== *Darcy Patel - an 18 year old Hindu girl from Philadelphia who writes a novel in 30 days after discovering that her mother’s childhood friend had been murdered. Upon gaining a two-book deal for her original manuscript, Darcy defers college for a year to move to New York City to conduct her rewrites and begin her second novel. Darcy is quickly swept up in the world of YA writing as she navigates her newly adult freedom, her career, and even a blossoming romance. *Imogen Gray - a fellow author with the same publisher as Darcy, Imogen quickly becomes Darcy’s main confidant and eventual love interest in the city. Her book is Pyromancer, the first of a trilogy focusing on people with special powers. But there is a secrecy behind Imogen’s real identity and inspiration for Pyromancer that Darcy struggles with. *Nisha Patel - Darcy’s 14-year-old sister who is in charge of Darcy’s New York budget, even though the budget is largely ignored by Darcy. Nisha is often credited as being wiser than the average 14 year old. *Annika Patel - Darcy’s mother whose own childhood story serves as the inspiration for Afterworlds *Darcy’s father - an engineer who wants Darcy to be a successful career woman *Carla and Sagan - Darcy’s friends from high school who visit her in New York ===Lizzie's Story=== *Lizzie Scofield - the protagonist in Darcy’s story. After pretending to be dead in order to survive a terrorist attack in an airport, Lizzie finds that she has actually crossed over and now has the ability to communicate with and see ghosts in the real world while also holding the power to transcend into the Afterworld. Mortals who can cross over are referred to as ‘psychopomps’. *Yamaraj - The first psychopomp to cross over to the Afterworld. He stay there for thousands of years and even becomes the protector for numerous souls. Yamaraj begins as a guide for Lizzie as she begins exploring the Afterworld. He is based on a Bollywood actor and stories from the Hindu Vedas; he is often referred to as a ‘Hindu death God’ by Darcy and others in the real world. *Anna Scofield - Lizzie’s mother whose childhood friend was murdered and is based on the story Darcy learns of her own mother. *Mindy - childhood friend of Anna who was murdered. She has stayed around the Scofield household for majority of her afterlife journey and forms a friendship with Lizzie. ==Reception== The majority of the reviews for Afterworlds are positive and applaud Westerfeld for representing the passion of reading and writing in Darcy. Most reviewers felt that Darcy's story was the stronger of the two. Stephanie Zacharek of the New York Times writes, \\"the otherworldly story Darcy has invented for Lizzie isn't nearly as compelling as Darcy's real-world one.\\" Tasha Robinson of NPR writes, \\"while Lizzie's story is briskly thrilling, it's ultimately more valuable as a window into Darcy's mind.\\" ==References== Category:2014 American novels Category:Novels by Scott Westerfeld ","title":"Afterworlds"},{"id":"56680844","text":"William Robert Withers (born 8 August 1931) is an Australian politician.

So far it's better for it. This new CBS All Access program has enough to stand on without it thanks to an array of characters who are interesting if not a little cliche.\\" In a more mixed critique, Varietys offered the series qualified praise saying, \\"For all its faults, the series is enthusiastically pulpy, moving with a propulsive energy that, to be frank, most streaming dramas lack. It's not nearly operating on the same prescient level as, say, The Good Fight, nor quite the radical re- imagining of fairy tales as advertised. But if nothing else, Tell Me a Story's got a wicked bite that might serve it well when trying to grab curious viewers on a streaming platform that doesn't quite have anything else like it.\\" In an outright negative assessment, RogerEbert.coms Brian Tallerico criticized the series saying, \\"There are talented TV veterans in Tell Me a Story, likely lured by Williamson's pedigree, but even they fail to give what could reasonably be called good performances. The pacing, the dialogue, the (complete lack of) visual language, the world building—it's impossible to point to a single element that works.\\" ==Home media== The first season was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 1, 2019. ==ReferencesCategory:2010s American anthology television series Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2020 American television series endings Category:2020s American anthology television series Category:2020s American drama television series Category:American television series based on Spanish television series Category:American thriller television series Category:Anthology web series Category:CBS All Access original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows based on fairy tales Category:Television series created by Kevin Williamson Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Psychological thriller web series Category:Works based on Hansel and Gretel Category:Works based on Little Red Riding Hood Category:Works based on The Three Little Pigs ","title":"Tell Me a Story (TV series)"},{"id":"56680884","text":"Bhakkar is a city in Punjab, Pakistan.

He is credited with modernizing the Tribune, shifting its news coverage and editorial page away from reflexive partisanship and—in a famous editorial—calling for the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. == Early life and education == Kirkpatrick grew up in Waterman, Illinois, the son of an operator of a machine shop and garage. Kirkpatrick graduated in 1937 from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Career == After itinerant jobs around the country, Kirkpatrick joined Chicago's City News Bureau in late January 1938.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick had hoped for a job at the Chicago Daily News but instead joined the Tribune in 1938, where his first jobs were as a general-assignment reporter and then covering the federal courts.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 In 1942, Kirkpatrick enlisted in the United States Army, working in Army intelligence and mostly spending his time stationed in England.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick rose up to become a master sergeant was awarded the Bronze Star. He was discharged in November 1945.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick spent 15 years as a reporter at the Tribune before becoming a copy editor in 1954. He then served as make-up editor, chief of the neighborhood news sections and an assignment editor. More promotions followed, as Kirkpatrick was named city editor in 1961, assistant managing editor in 1963, managing editor in 1965 and executive editor in 1967.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick was named the Tribune's editor on January 1, 1969.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 He immediately replaced the Tribune's partisan writing and reporting with balanced, objective coverage.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick also altered the design and layout of the Tribune, adding new sections geared toward reader interests. The changes wound up influencing the broader newspaper world.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 In February 1974, Time (magazine) named the Tribune one of the nation's 10 best newspapers.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Watergate == In 1974, Kirkpatrick sought for the Tribune to become the first newspaper to publish the Watergate scandal transcripts in their entirety.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick and the Tribune's Washington reporters negotiated with Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, to get the transcripts early and then fly the transcripts on a company jet to Chicago, where a task force quickly prepared them for publication. They were published in a 44-page special section.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 One week later, Kirkpatrick, who previously had been a Nixon supporter, concluded after reading the transcripts that the Tribune should call for Nixon's resignation. He authored a May 9, 1974 editorial that used uncharacteristically blunt language in stating that it was time for Nixon to resign. \\"We saw the public man in his first administration, and we were impressed. Now in about 300,000 words we have seen the private man, and we are appalled,\\" the editorial read. \\"The key word here is immoral. It is a lack of concern for morality, a lack of concern for high principles, a lack of commitment to the high ideals of public office that make the transcripts a sickening exposure of the man and his advisers...He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.\\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 The editorial concluded: \\"The President is right in urging a quick end to the Watergate affair. His country needs a swift and merciful termination of this agony. Two roads are open. One is resignation. The other is impeachment. Both are legitimate and would satisfy the need to observe due process.\\" That the editorial came from the Tribune—a paper that long had been synonymous with Republican politics—made it especially influential both in the U.S. and overseas.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Later life == In 1979, Kirkpatrick was promoted to become president and CEO of the Tribune Company. He retired on June 1, 1981.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 After retiring, Kirkpatrick, an enthusiastic golfer, served on the board of the Cantigny Trust and urged his fellow board members to approve plans for a 27-hole golf course, called the Cantigny Golf Club, on the grounds of the estate of former Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Personal == Kirkpatrick was married to Thelma Kirkpatrick for 55 years until her death in 1998.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 He had four children and lived in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick died on June 19, 2004 at his home of congestive heart failure.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == References == Category:1915 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Chicago Tribune people Category:American male journalists Category:20th-century American journalists Category:Writers from Chicago ","title":"Clayton Kirkpatrick"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,t){const m=p("PoemCard");return i(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(i(!0),n(h,null,y(t.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(i(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const E=d(P,[["render",H]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/52.md","filePath":"drive/52.md"}'),D={name:"drive/52.md"},x=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[C(E)]))}});export{L as __pageData,x as default};
