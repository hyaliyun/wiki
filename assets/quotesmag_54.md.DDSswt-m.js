He is a member of the Council of Representatives of Iraq representing the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA). Hamoudi is leader of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. Role in the Iraqi Constitution Hamoudi was Chairman of the Committee that drafted the Iraqi Constitution in 2005. Although the constitution was ratified, there were complaints by many of the drafters as well as observers that the process was rushed, incomplete and failed to accommodate legitimate Sunni concerns. Others have complained that some of the more hardline Sunni elements, among them Salih Mutlaq, had demands that were unreasonable, including opposition to a ban on Saddam's Ba'ath party and a refusal to consider any form of federalism beyond the Kurdish region. The United States, and Donald Rumsfeld in particular, pushed hard for resolution, and it is clear that Hamoudi favored moving forward and pushing off at least some of these issues for later. On the basis of a promise to reopen negotiations over the Constitution, the largest Sunni faction in the Iraqi Parliament, the moderate Iraqi Islamic Party, did not oppose the Constitution's passing, though harder line Sunnis, Mutlaq among them, remained vocally opposed. By accounts of US Embassy officials near to the drafting process, and specifically Jeffrey Beals, Hamoudi was among the least partisan of the Shi'ite faction, though ultimately he did advocate forcefully for their position, particularly on federalism, after the Kurdish factions continued to insist on maximum regional control of the Kurdish regionate. Hamoudi has made statements that suggest that he is unwilling to make compromises to the Constitution at this point, though again complaints arise in the opposite direction that the Sunni position of opposition to all forms of federalism is similarly unreasonable. Most neutral reports tend to blame all factions for the current impasse, rather than Hamoudi personally or the Shi'ite factions he represents. Hamoudi is currently (August 2007) the Chairman of the Constitution Review Committee, the parliamentary committee charged with making changes to the constitution in order to make it more acceptable to the Sunnis. In particular, most Sunnis as well as Sadrists are against the specific arrangements regarding regionalism. A recent article by Hamoudi in the Stanford Law Review suggests that \\"the majority are not bound to consider all that is demanded by the minority\\" (italics added).Dr Human Hamoudi, \\"My perceptions on the Iraqi constitutional process,‚Äù in Stanford Law Review Vol 59 Issue 5 (2007): p.1315ff. The term \\"consider\\", however, may be a mistranslation of Hamoudi's sentiments (he does not speak English), as the English in the article is clearly not of a very high quality generally, and the same Article makes clear Hamoudi's willingness to discuss many of these issues in the Constitutional Review Committee proceedings. It seems from the context that he meant that there is no obligation to accede to all of the demands of the Sunni parties. Certainly, however, it is not clear that Hamoudi, or the Sunnis with whom most of the negotiations are taking place, are very willing to make any compromises of significance at this point in time. In addition to his role in the constitution, Hamoudi was on the three man committee appointed by the UIA to decide on an alternative to Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari in February 2006. He is also the chief of the Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee.

Liturgical seasons The church year begins on the first Sunday of Advent, which is the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day. The church year begins on and The church year is divided into a number of seasons: *Advent, Advent is the period which anticipates, prepares for, and builds up to Christmas. There are four Sundays in Advent. *Christmas, the Christmas season begins on Christmas Day which falls on the 25th of December each year. There are 12 days in Christmas. *The period of Ordinary time after Epiphany, Epiphany falls on the 6th of January each year, but is usually celebrated on the Sunday between the 2nd and 8th days of January. *Lent, Lent begins on Ash Wednesday ( and ) *Easter lasts 50 days, using inclusive counting and begins on the Feast of the Resurrection of the Lord ( and ) *The period of Ordinary time after Pentecost. The preface to the calendar in the prayer book describes its purpose: The Church's year both commemorates and proclaims how God came down from heaven to earth in Jesus Christ, who still lives among us by the Holy Spirit until he comes again at the end of time. The yearly observance of the holy days of the calendar is a celebration of what God has done and is doing for our salvation. Holy days are distinguished as Great Festivals (being the principal celebrations), Festivals (celebrating New Testament events), Commemorations (recalling particular individuals and events), and other Special Days - the observance of the former taking precedence over the latter in the event of clashes. The preface to the calendar describes the commemorations as occasions: when the Church thankfully recalls the work and witness of men and women through whom Christ's saving victory has been manifested from the time of the apostles to the present day.  Great Festivals  Each and every Sunday in the year is a Great Festival, in addition the following days are Great Festivals: *Christmas Day which is celebrated on the 25th of December each year. *Epiphany which falls on the 6th of January each year, but is usually celebrated on the Sunday between the 2nd and the 8th of January. *Ascension Day ( and ). *Corpus Christi also known as the Commemoration of the Holy Communion and falls on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday ( and ). *All Saints' Day which falls on the 1st day of November each year. The following Sundays (also Great Festivals) have special significance: * The Baptism of the Lord is celebrated on the first Sunday after the Epiphany. * The Transfiguration of Jesus is celebrated on the Sunday before Lent. * Palm Sunday: The Sunday of the Passion ( and ). *The Feast of the Resurrection of the Lord ( and ). * The Day of Pentecost ( and ). * Trinity Sunday: The Sunday after Pentecost ( and ). *The Reign of Christ is celebrated on the last Sunday of the liturgical year, i.e. the Sunday before the first Sunday of Advent ( and ).  Festivals and commemorations  Festivals are shown in bold text and commemorations are shown in regular type.

It is monotypic within the genus Cheramoeca. As with all swallows within the family Hirundinidae, it is characterised by adaptation to aerial feeding. The white-backed swallow can be identified by its white back, surrounded by black wings and tail. The white- backed swallow has a wide distribution, from the southern part of the Australian continent, up to the Tropic of Capricorn. The white-backed swallow prefers grasslands and will create a burrow nest.Sitting white-backed swallow Taxonomy John Gould first described the white-backed swallow in 1841 and included it in his publication ‚ÄúThe Birds of Australia‚Äù. The white-backed swallow is also sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúBlack-and-white Swallow\\", \\"White- breasted Swallow\\", \\"White-capped Swallow.\\". A taxonomic synonym for Cheramoeca leucosterna is Cheramoeca leucosternus.  Description  Birds of Australia Cheramoeca Leucosterna An adult white-backed swallows averages 15 cm long, similar in size to other swallows found within Australia. The adult has a mottled grey cap above white eyebrows and a grey eye stripe across the nape of the neck. The back and most of the breast is white. The belly, wings and tail are black. The white-backed swallow has a deeply forked tail, with curved and pointed wings. The short bill is black; the legs and feet are grey. They have a slender, streamlined body. Their eyes consist of a prominent, dark iris. The sexes have similar colouring but during adolescence the white-backed swallow has duller colours.  Distribution and habitat  White-backed Swallows are endemic to Australia and have a wide population distribution on the continent. They can be found from the southern latitudes of Australia and their range extends to the Tropic of Capricorn. Occasionally, after inland rainfall, white-backed swallows can extend their range to encompass the entire southern portion of Australia including the desert regions. White-backed Swallows prefer open country, above open grassland and low shrubs. During the breeding season, they have a strong preference for habitats around creek beds. There is no population count, but the species is reported to be common. Due to range expansion from land clearance and mining, the population is estimated to be increasing. Due to the large range and increasing population, the white-backed swallow is categorised as least concern. Pair of swallows on barbed wire fence  Behaviour  White-backed Swallows are insectivorous and feed in-flight on insects, like all known swallows. The composition of its diet varies by geographic region and with the time of year. The white-backed swallow typically nests by digging a horizontal tunnel into a vertical dirt cliff. Predation of swallows nests is known to occur, typically from foxes and cats.

The station is a full-time relay of the programming of the WILK News Radio network featuring a news and talk radio format. The station broadcasts at a frequency of 1300 kHz with a power of 5,000 watts daytime with a directional antenna signal pattern focused towards the north, then switches to a power of 500 Watts at night with another directional signal pattern focused towards the northeast. WODS is considered a Class-B AM broadcasting station according to the Federal Communications Commission. History Prior use of 1300 kHz in Hazleton The first station at 1300 kHz in the Hazleton area operated from October 26, 1961, to January 14, 1965, as WTHT, which became WHZN in 1964. Broadcasting from studios and a transmitter southeast of Hazleton, the station experienced a turbulent final year which included a license renewal designated for hearing, financial problems, and a union strike which prompted the station to go off air for good. An attempt to reactivate the frequency in the late 1960s and early 1970s failed due to its specification of West Hazleton as the city of license despite not covering it completely. Current license The current station on 1300 kHz signed on in 1982 with the call sign WWKC, branded as \\"KC Country\\", with a country music format. At the time, it only broadcast with 500 watts of power and was a daytime only station. It was only the second AM station to serve the Hazleton area. The country music format did not do very well in the market, so in 1983, the station changed to an adult standards format with the addition of some local news and talk at the same time changing call signs to WXPX and increasing its daytime power to its present 5,000 watts. The WXPX call sign lasted until 1996, when the station was sold and the format and call signs were changed to WILP. Another ownership and format change happened in 2001 when the station changed call signs to WOGY. The station was sold to its present owners, Entercom Communications, and joined the WILK News Radio network. The station's call signs were changed to WKZN in 2005, and to WODS in 2020.

The species is a common endemic of Australia. It has a disjunct distribution, occurring in Central Australia and the Pilbara region of Western Australia. There are two subspecies, the nominate Chlamydera guttata guttata, which occupies most of its range, and C. guttata cateri, which occurs only the North West Cape in Western Australia. The species was first collected in 1861 by the explorer Francis Gregory, who gave the specimen to John Gould. The specific name guttata means spotted, referring to its plumage. The species is similar to Chlamydera maculata, the spotted bowerbird, and has often been treated as a subspecies of it. The western bowerbird is smaller than the other bowerbird it shares its range with, the great bowerbird. It measures between 24‚Äì28 cm in length and weighs between 120-150 g. Both sexes are similar in size and dimensions, except that the tail of the female is slightly longer. The plumage is brown with reddish or buff spots over the throat, chest, neck, back head and wings, with a pink erectile crest on the nape. The tail is brown and the undersides are buff. The plumage of the female is similar to the male but more spotted on the throat. The western bowerbird feeds on fruits, particularly those of the rock fig (Ficus platypoda), sandalwood, snake gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) and mistletoes. They will also enter farms to feed on cultivated fruits. Other items taken in the diet include nectar, flowers, insects such as ants, moths, beetles and grasshoppers, and spiders. They need to drink regularly and are rarely found far from water. Western bowerbird bower, Northern Territory, Australia Like most bowerbirds the western bowerbird is polygamous, with a male mating with several females over a breeding season and the female undertaking all nesting, incubation and chick-rearing responsibilities. As is typical in the family the male constructs an elaborate bower with which to attract females. Western bowerbird bowers are paired avenues of sticks, 20‚Äì25 cm tall, and 25-35 long placed on top of a platform of sticks. The bower is decorated with green and white objects, including berries, fruits, shells, pebbles and bones. Man-made objects may also be used for decoration, including glass, gun casings and metal objects. Each bower may be used for a number of years and when new bowers are constructed material from the older bower will be recycled. The male advertises his bower with calls, when the female arrives to inspect he will perform ritualised dances, fanning his tail, jumping and wing flicking, as well as further calling. Decorations will also be held in the bill and shaken vigorously, and the pink crest on the neck will be erected. The female constructs the nest, a shallow cup of small twigs nested on a larger platform of sticks, around 2‚Äì6 m up a tree or shrub, often in a clump of mistletoe. The clutch is usually one or two eggs, which are green to buff, glossy and covered in dark scribble patterns. The incubation period is unknown.

It is endemic to the mountains of Colombia, and as of 2010 has been categorized as vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN. Description The multicolored tanager is a small-sized passerine bird approximately 12 cm (5 in.) long. Males have a yellow crown, face, mantle, and throat; chestnut and black ear coverts; bright green nape and wings; blue rump, breast, and belly; and a black patch in the center of the underparts. Females are duller and lack the yellow mantle and black patch on the underparts. Immature birds of both sexes resemble females, but are duller. Etymology The genus name Chlorochrysa refers to the bright green and yellow regions of the plumage. The species name nitidissima means \\"very bright\\", referring to the beauty of its plumage. Distribution and habitat The multicolored tanager is endemic to the interior of wet montane forests of the Occidental and Central Cordillera of Colombia. It is found mainly from 1300 to 2200 meters above sea level; however, some records indicate it can be found as low as 900 meters, especially in the Department of Cauca. It has been recorded in the Departments of Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Choco, Quind√≠o, Risaralda, Caldas, and Antioquia. It seems to prefer mature forests, although it has also been recorded in mature secondary forests and forest edges. Most of the recent records of the species come from the Valle del Cauca Department, where it resides year-round and remains fairly common even in small forest fragments. Food and feeding This species is most often found as part of mixed-species flocks in the upper canopy of the forest. It usually searches for insects on the underside of leaves of outer limbs while clinging to leaves with its feet. It has also been reported eating ripe fruit, mainly from the genera Cordia, Miconia, Palicourea, and Ficus. Breeding Information on breeding behavior and seasonality of the species mostly consists of individual and isolated records. Hilty and Brown reported a stub-tailed juvenile with two adults on 1 November, and a grown juvenile on 8 January. Both records came from the West Andes above Cali, Valle del Cauca (Occidental Cordillera). In August 1990, two adults were recorded feeding chicks in the same area, and in January 2000, a juvenile and two adults were observed eating fruit near the Bitaco River Forest Reserve in Chicoral, Valle del Cauca. One juvenile and one adult male were recorded on 11 February 2001, at Kilometer 18 on the Cali-Buenaventura highway. Records from the Central Cordillera include sightings of two juveniles and adults in March 2000, in La Magdalena, above Buga. During 1996, juveniles of the species were observed at the Santuario de Fauna y Flora Ot√∫n- Quimbaya, and Parque Regional Ucumar√≠, in the department of Risaralda. Three specimens in reproductive condition, and one immature bird were collected in May and June in the Central Cordillera (specimens located at USNM). Collectively, these data suggest that adults breed from November to August, a common pattern among tropical resident birds. Conservation status The IUCN has listed this species as vulnerable, mainly because of its small range, and also because it is only known from a small number of locations. The multicolored tanager used to be fairly common, but population declines have been recorded throughout its range owing to ongoing habitat destruction, and nowadays it is only encountered very infrequently, primarily in remnant forest fragments. Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to the species: approximately 81% of its habitat has been lost to date. Renjifo suggested that this species is very sensitive to habitat fragmentation as it is found in 16% of point counts from interior, continuous forest, but in only 3% of point counts in forest fragments. The expanding network of roads across the species' range has led to increases in logging, mining, agriculture, and human settlement. Although the species occurs in protected areas with large tracts of suitable habitat like Farallones de Cali, Munchique, and Los Nevados National Parks, most recent records come from unprotected and private forests in the Valle del Cauca Department. Proposed conservation actions include increasing the number and size of protected areas within the species' range, as well as enforcing conservation measures in previously protected areas, and providing non-damaging alternatives to settlers. Scientific research studies are necessary in order to accurately estimate the size of the different subpopulations and to gain insight about the species' ecological requirements. Most recent records for the multicolored tanager come from the Valle del Cauca department, in the Western Andes right outside Cali. Since the construction of the Cali-Buenaventura road during the first decade of the twentieth century, this area has been heavily transformed, mainly for agriculture and cattle ranching, and the remaining forest patches range from 10 to 400 ha. Two Important Bird Areas (Chicoral and San Antonio) have been declared in the area within the last two decades, which has led to increasing awareness in the local community to bird conservation. These areas are connected to Los Farallones National Park (also an Important Bird Area), which has a total area of around 150,000 ha. Seven Civil Society Reserves and one Regional Reserve are also part of the habitat protected for this and other threatened species in the locality. Bosque de Yotoco Reserve is another Important Bird Area in the Valle del Cauca department where this species occurs. In addition to protected areas, several NGOs work in various aspects of conservation in the zone, especially environmental education with the local communities.

In his younger years, Takusabur≈ç studied Confucian, Buddhist, Christian and Methodist thought. In his later years, Takusabur≈ç devoted his life in disseminating the importance of liberty and rights for the people. His numerous texts include the draft constitution in 1880 (influenced by texts regarding English, German and American models of governmental structure), The Institutional Maxims of Chiba Takusabur≈ç, Treatise on the Kingly Way, and On the Futility of Book Learning. Takusabur≈ç died in late 1883 after a long battle with tuberculosis.Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), Ch.3. Chiba Takusabur≈ç attempted to bring forth a \\"grass roots\\" society, driven by the people. Chiba is emblematic of how the revolutionary spirit, more frequently attributed to men like Itagaki Taisuke, ≈åkuma Shigenobu and Fukuzawa Yukichi, was existent in even low ranking samurai during the Freedom and People's Rights Movement or Jiy≈´ Minken Und≈ç.Ann Waswo (1987), \\"The Culture of the Meiji Period: a Review\\", Journal of Japanese Studies 13 (1), 140‚Äì145  Background  After the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, the Meiji era began. Though acting in the name of imperial interests, the Meiji Restoration consolidated all power to an oligarchy, composed of the old samurai elite. By the 1870s, political protest against the new Meiji government emerged. Formerly a leader of the Restoration, Itagaki Taisuke urged the public to end the tyranny of the inner elite dominating the government. This Freedom and People's Rights Movement petitioned for a national assembly elected by the people. When the government rejected the petition in 1874, the People's Rights Movement increasingly mobilized the agitated urban public. The voices of revolution and modern consciousness soon reached even remote mountain villages.Peter Duus, Modern Japan, (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998) Itagaki Taisuke  Early life  On 17 June 1852, Chiba Takusabur≈ç was born into a rural samurai family in the Shirahata village of Kurihara county. Separated from his biological mother at the age of three, Takusabur≈ç was raised by his foster mother Sada along with his older brother Rihachi. At the age of 12, Takusabur≈ç became a student of Confucian scholar ≈åtsuki Bankei and began his formal education. However, his education at the Sendai domain school was cut short by the Boshin War. Answering the fervent cries of Sendai Domain troops to support the ruling Tokugawa government, Takusabur≈ç left ≈åtsuki to Shirakawaguchi where he engaged in combat twice against the new government army. When returning home, Takusabur≈ç found his old teacher arrested and imprisoned for his role in resisting Satch≈çdo forces. leftthumb400px Sendai troops against Meiji government forces in April, 1868  \\"Wanderer Seeking Truth\\"  After Bankei's arrest and the establishment of the Meiji government, Takusabur≈ç began studying medicine under Ishikawa ≈åsho. A progressive minded doctor near Sendai, ≈åsho began his own studies under It≈ç Genboku and several Dutch doctors in Nagasaki in the late Tokugawa era. Greatly revered by ≈åtsuki's students, ≈åsho appealed to Takusabur≈ç with his pioneering intellectual views. Facing a similar fate as ≈åtsuki himself, ≈åsho was arrested and imprisoned by the new Meiji government for \\"aiding and abetting the sh≈çgun\\".Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 80. It≈ç Genboku In 1868, Takusabur≈ç began his studies of National Learning, known as kokugaku, under Nabeshima Ichir≈ç in Kesennuma. In Nabeshima, an eccentric teacher educating students in both arithmetic and classical Japanese literature, Takusabur≈ç hoped to discover the ideology of the Meiji government. Kokugaku studies encapsulated the philosophy behind the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement \\"Revere the Emperor,\\" and contributed to the dissent against the Tokugawa shogunate. Unlike Takusabur≈ç's previous teachers, Nabeshima emphasized the importance of the return of the Emperor's rule and the divine spirit of the imperial ancestors. Four years later, in 1872, Takusabur≈ç began his studies under a Pure Land Buddhist monk known as Sakurai Kyohaku. However, as Christian thought reached northeastern Japan, Takusabur≈ç left his Buddhist studies after five months and turned to the tutelage of Father Nikolai. Father Nikolai Born as Ivan Dimitriyevich Kasatkin in 1863, Father Nikolai dreamed of traveling to Japan after reading Captain Vasily Golovnin's, Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan in St. Petersburg. When ordained in 1860, Father Nikolai received permission to reside in Hokkaid≈ç as the new Russian consulate. Though he could not propagate Christian beliefs publicly, as anti-Christian bans were still imposed by Japanese government, Father Nikolai devoted seven years to the study of Japanese language, history, and Confucian and Buddhist thought. After he baptized his first Japanese converts in 1868, word reached the Pure Land Buddhist follower Takusabur≈ç. Because Father Nikolai's new spiritual ideals assimilated traditional conservative beliefs, Russian Orthodoxy became increasingly popular among the \\"ruined samurai\\" class which included Takusabur≈ç. It is unclear whether or not Takusabur≈ç was baptized. According to historian Daikichi Irokawa, the name Takusabur≈ç does not appear under the seminary's baptismal records. However, researchers Richard Devine and Otis Cary state that Takusabur≈ç left for Tokyo to study directly under Father Nikolai, and was baptized as Peter Chiba in 1872.Otis Cary, A History of Christianity in Japan, (London: Fleming H. Revell, 1909, 402‚Äì409) When returning to Sendai, the newly Peter Chiba (Takusabur≈ç) was arrested because of his religious preaching and disputes with the Buddhists and Shintoists in his community. After completing his hundred-day prison sentence, Takusabur≈ç returned to Father Nikolai's seminary in Ochanomizu, Tokyo.Richard Devine (1979), \\"The Way of the King: An Early Meiji Essay on Government\\", Monumenta Nipponica 34 (1), 49‚Äì72 In 1872, the Japanese government confronted Father Nikolai, with accusations that Father Nikolai disparaged the Meiji Emperor in his sermons. In response, Father Nikolai's beliefs stressed the submission to the Emperor and state authority as true faithfulness to God. Consequently, Takusabur≈ç grew increasingly detached to Father Nikolai's mission.  Spiritual crisis  In 1875, Takusabur≈ç left Father Nikolai to study under Confucian scholar Yasui Sokken of the Ichigaya Academy. This move marked a radical change in Takusabur≈ç's beliefs. While drawing ideas from the kokugaku ideology, Sokken was ultimately unorthodox in his beliefs. Unlike the teachings of Father Nikolai, Sokken was notorious for his denunciation of Christian intellectuals in early Meiji Japan, most notably in his controversial text Benm≈ç meaning vindication. Christian missionaries viewed Sokken's heretical beliefs as the work of the Anti-Christ himself. Takusabur≈ç first entered the Academy several years after Sokken's most accomplished disciple had passed. Executed by the Meiji government in 1870, Kumoi Tatsuo was only twenty six years old when he planned an insurrection to reestablish feudal rule. Just before his execution, Kumoi wrote a poem of resistance against the authoritarian forces, lauded by other activists as \\"a compelling image of resolute revolutionary resistance\\".Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 87‚Äì88. Kumoi's poem would later inspire and rouse the interests of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement supporters, which would include Takusabur≈ç. After Yasui Sokken's death ten months after Takusabur≈ç's admission, Takusabur≈ç left to study under French Catholic priest Father Fran√ßois Paulin Vigroux, a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society who had traveled to Japan in 1873. Coined as a \\"walking priest\\", Vigroux traveled a Catholic circuit through Japan's major cities every month. While Takusabur≈ç accompanied Vigroux on these tours, Takusabur≈ç first became acquainted with the residents of Itsukaichi, where he would eventually end his years of wandering.  Learning and Debating Society  In August 1877, Takusabur≈ç met with missionary Reverend Maclay. A member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Maclay was sent to Japan three years earlier amidst the wave of Methodist mission stations already established in Nagasaki, Hakodate and Shinsh≈´ among other major cities. It is believed that this step towards Methodism eventually paved the path to Takusabur≈ç's leap into liberal activism. After many years on his spiritual quest for truth, Takusabur≈ç found a home in Itsukaichi, where the plans for the Freedom and People's Rights movement were already unraveling. In 1872, regulations in Japan set a mandate extending universal elementary schooling to all classes, dismantling upper class monopolization of education access. Inspired by the American model of education, Japan hoped that education would produce \\"free and independent individuals\\".Peter Duus, Modern Japan, (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998), 92 Under this provision, the Kann≈ç School was opened as an elementary school in Itsukaichi in 1876, headed by Naganuma Orinoj≈ç. After hearing of the many Sendai men already appointed, Takusabur≈ç joined the school in 1880. rightthumb400px Imagined reconstruction of the Itsukaichi Kann≈ç School By 1880, Itsukaichi became the center of activity for metropolitan intellectuals \\"on the crest\\" of the Freedom and People's Rights movement.Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 96‚Äì97. The new Learning and Debating Society became the ground for local activists to improve debating and oratory skills and increase the level of political discussion. An active member of the group, Takusabur≈ç soon grasped the essence of the natural rights theory. That same year, Takusabur≈ç began privately lashing out against the Meiji government who \\"deprived\\" the Japanese of their \\"most precious freedoms\\". Though the new government had seemingly maintained order behind their reformist policies, Takusabur≈ç believed that unbeknownst to the Japanese, it came at an enormous cost of \\"our brothers' blood, sweat, and toil\\". More importantly, Takusabur≈ç asserted the necessity of a national assembly and constitution, previously promised by the Emperor Meiji himself. In response to the widespread petitions calling for the establishment of a constitution, the Council of State declared that the Japanese citizens possess no rights. Furthermore, the Japanese citizens were faced with more suppression of free speech through the newly instated Newspaper and Assembly Laws. In response, Takusabur≈ç believed that in order to preserve liberty, freedom and happiness, the Learning and Debating Society must take this immense responsibility on their own hands.  Draft constitution  After his ten years of wandering, Takusabur≈ç had finally found happiness in Itsukaichi. In a letter to his companion and fellow teacher at the Kann≈ç School in December 1880, Fukasawa Naomaru, Takusabur≈ç shared the communal nature of the Learning and Debate Society. > The members of this study group have firmly resolved to devote themselves to > furthering freedom and to reforming society. Sharing an inflexible > determination to overcome all obstacles, we are united by a spirit of > affection, esteem, and harmony. It is almost as if we were of the same flesh > and blood, or brothers in one large family. Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 108 In that same month, Takusabur≈ç was approached by a regional Freedom and People's Rights meeting known as the Musashi Friendship Society or Bush≈´ konshin kai convening the directors of the organization. A month later, Takusabur≈ç received a copy of the ≈åmei Society draft constitution, which guided his own ideas. In his research, Takusabur≈ç came across collections of John Stuart Mill's Considerations on Representative Government, A. Chambers' A Constitutional History of England, Francis Lieber's On Civil Liberty and Self-Government, and Bernhard Windscheid's Introduction to German Civil Law among many others. Using these texts, Takusabur≈ç hoped to adopt European and American ideas to model a democratic future for Japan as well. During his meetings at the 'Learning and Debating Society,' Takusabur≈ç relentlessly worked out the fine details of the articles which delegated the rights of the people, and the powers that would be left to the national assembly. While Takusabur≈ç's initial draft lacked legal sophistication and continuity, his constitution remained unique from both the ≈åmei Society's and Western models. Takusabur≈ç's 1881 constitution envisioned a two house legislature, with a nonelected upper house. However, this upperhouse reversed the criteria for membership placing the speaker of the elected house in first position, which the royal family and aristocracy in the last position. Takusabur≈ç's constitution also clearly stated that any convicted person will not be subject to capital punishment, and that the terms \\"guilty\\" or \\"innocence\\" must be determined through a trial by jury. In the early 1880s, segregation of educational systems from political thought emerged. As the Ministry of Education made repeated attempts to separate education and politics, Itagaki Taisuke as well as other leaders of the People's Rights Movement stressed the inseparability of the two realms. A series of ordinances and guidelines were passed by the Japanese government in 1880, which defined the moral character‚Äî patriotism and reverence for the Emperor‚Äî that should be embodied in all schoolteachers. Local schoolteachers resisted by forming organizational assemblies to lobby high-level political authorities on educational policy. Though by no means independent, these assemblies were a voice for the people to communicate views and exert influence.Brian Platt, Burning and Building School and State Formation in Japan, 1750‚Äì1890, (Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2004), 215‚Äì246 On 6 July 1881, an edict passed by the Kanagawa prefectural governor prohibited elementary school teachers from personally engaging in any political activity. Takusabur≈ç resigned his position at the Kann≈ç Elementary School in response to this edict which coincided with disputes with the school principal Naganuma, and left for Sayama. Later that year, Nagunuma resigned from his position after nine years at the Kann≈ç School. October 1881 marked a major crisis within the oligarchy of the Meiji government as the Freedom and People's Right movement was simultaneously reaching the pinnacle of their success. In 1882, the mayor of Itsukaichi, Baba Kanzaemon, and the Kann≈ç School overseers Fukasawa Gompachi and Uchino Sh≈çbei joined the Liberal Party, or Jiy≈´t≈ç established by Itagaki Taisuke. This administration allowed Takusabur≈ç to return to Itsukaichi and become principal of the Kann≈ç School in Nagunuma's absence. Under Takusabur≈ç's administration, most teachers assigned by the prefectural government were dismissed. With the support of Mayor Baba Kanzaemon, Takusabur≈ç was essentially given free rein over the Kann≈ç School. After Takusabur≈ç's death in 1883, his successor lashed out, claiming Takusabur≈ç had turned the school into a bastion of the Freedom and People's Right Movement. During his time at Sayama, Takusabur≈ç received his first copies of the newly founded Liberal Party pledge and membership list. It is debated whether Takusabur≈ç joined the Liberal Party. Daikichi Irokawa states that Takusabur≈ç stamped his seal on both documents, indicating that he joined the Liberal Party. However, Richard Devine states that while many members of the Learning and Debating Society enlisted in the Liberal Party, Takusabur≈ç himself never joined. Devine attributes this to possible adherence of the edict passed by the Kanagawa government, or Takusabur≈ç's deteriorating health at the time.  Legacy  In June 1882, Takusabur≈ç left for Kusatsu hot springs for sixty days to recover from his illness. In his last will and testament to his close friend Fukazawa Gonpachi, Takusabur≈ç expressed concern for the future activists. Takusabur≈ç warned Gonpachi against those who \\"do not stick to principles but just follow a leader and not a principle ... [and to also] take initiative in siding with justice, set the agenda for discussion topics, and lead the followers away from error\\".Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 114 Months later, Takusabur≈ç wrote the Treatise on the Kingly Way, a guide to administer the \\"Kingly Way\\" or the \\"Great Way of Governance\\". In his text, Takusabur≈ç emphasizes that while people's rights and freedom must be protected, limits on their power must also be exercised‚Äîlikewise, restraints must also be placed on the Imperial rule. By keeping both these forces into balance, the society can exist in \\"Great Harmony\\". In 1882, there was a public dispute regarding to whom national sovereignty should lie. While royalists called for unlimited imperial rule, extreme activists believed that people's rights should be extended if necessary by armed force and resistance. In contrast, the Treatise on the Kingly Way opposed both sides of the political spectrum. Takusabur≈ç argued that by unifying the limited rights of both the people and the imperial force in a freely accepted contract, it will serve as a model for an ideal society. Though seemingly primitive compared to modern texts, the Treatise on the Kingly Way advanced over most theoretical works of Takusabur≈ç's time. leftthumb400px Chiba's manuscript copy of Treatise on the Kingly Way or ≈åd≈çron, 1882 In the summer of 1883, Takusabur≈ç wrote one of his last essays entitled On the Futility of Book Learning. In his text, Takusabur≈ç stated that: \\"Even the tumult of a crowd or the bustle of the marketplace can be the laboratory in which man attains wisdom.\\" Using his own experiences as a guide, Takusabur≈ç emphasized the world as a great book of learning, where real knowledge could only be attained by reading everyday life and searching for the truth. Chiba Takusabur≈ç died on 12 November 1883 at the age of thirty one from tuberculosis. Several years earlier, Takusabur≈ç had once described himself as \\"Mr. Takusabur≈ç Chiba, Distinguished Professor of Japanese Law, resident of Freedom Prefecture, Independence District, Righteous Spirit Village\\". However, as his sickness coincided along with the collapse of his vision of a liberal and free Japan, Takusabur≈ç expressed great sorrow for the pain of his people. In one of his last poems, Takusabur≈ç wrote: > Mountain barrier in snow and river rain// Ten years of search, with all gone > wrong,// Half a life spent traveling in vain, a dream reflected in a > window,// The cuckoo from the grove, calls// \\"Better retreat than continue > on.\\" Daikichi Irokawa, The Culture of the Meiji Period, (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985), 121 Western philosophers such as John Stuart Mills aroused \\"the spirit of enterprise\\" among the public with doctrines on the natural and inherent rights of man. Political protest was essential to the independent spirit. As freedom propagandist Ueki Emori argued in 1879, \\"[Nature] endows men with freedom. If people do not take this natural endowment, it is both a great sin against nature and a great disgrace to themselves.\\"Peter Duus, Modern Japan, (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998), 110 Chiba Takusabur≈ç, along with powerful figures such as Itagaki Taisuke, is emblematic of the \\"grass roots\\" philosophy. Chiba's vision of a free Japan deconstructed the traditions of the lower class, and became the driving force of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement.  Notes   Further reading  * Roger W. Brown.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For her very dangerous work under combat conditions, she was awarded six battle stars for World War II and one for the Korean War. Chikaskia was launched 2 October 1942 by Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Bates; acquired by the Navy 10 January 1943; and commissioned 10 November 1943, Commander L. J. Hasse, USNR, in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  On 15 December 1943 Chikaskia sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, loaded oil at Aruba and arrived at Pearl Harbor 7 January 1944. She joined Task Force 58 at Majuro 4 February and provided logistic support for the fast carrier force's strikes during the occupation of Kwajalein, and on Truk. Between 7 March and 15 September 1944 Chikaskia operated out of Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Purvis Bay, Florida Island; and Manus, Admiralties, bringing vital at-sea replenishment of fuel to the fast carrier task forces and other ships. Departing Manus 18 September 1944 to aid the fast carrier task force engaged in the invasion of the southern Palaus, Chikaskia gave a striking illustration of her capabilities by simultaneously refueling and 23 September.  Surviving typhoon conditions  Changing her base to Ulithi on 25 October 1944, Chikaskia continued to support the fast carrier units. She was part of the fueling unit that endured the typhoon which struck the U.S. 3rd Fleet during a fueling rendezvous 18 December, weathering the heavy seas to return safely to Ulithi 24 December. She continued to provide logistic support during the operations in the Philippines, and the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa until she returned to San Pedro, California, for overhaul 22 May 1945.  End-of-war activity  Chikaskia returned to Ulithi to support the U.S. 3rd Fleet from 17 August 1945 until she entered Tokyo Bay 20 September. After a period of shuttle service in support of the operations in China and Korea (8-22 November), she served as station tanker at Sasebo from 29 November 1945 to 31 March 1946.  Supporting nuclear testing  Chikaskia sailed from Sasebo 8 April 1946 bound for Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf, which she reached 30 April, and after loading oil, sailed for Kwajalein to participate in Operation Crossroads, the atomic weapons tests at Bikini Atoll.  Korean War support  Assigned to the Naval Transportation Service 1 July 1947, Chikaskia continued to operate in the Far East. On 1 October 1949 she was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service, established that date. Returned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, 28 February 1953, Chikaskia fueled ships operating in the Korean war between 30 May and 27 July. She continued to operate in the Pacific until June 1955, when she returned to the United States.  Final decommissioning  Chikaskia refueling and , 1967. Chikaskia was placed out of commission in reserve 7 November 1955. Recommissioned 12 December 1956 she was placed in the ready reserve in late 1957 and again joined the permanent Reserve Fleet in December 1958. Chikaskia was recommissioned on 17 December 1960. She was later decommissioned, 18 December 1969, at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was struck from the Naval Register, 1 December 1976 and transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was sold, 26 May 1982, her fate unknown.

He also erected the genera Aphyosemion and Fundulopanchax, which include dozens of widely kept killifish species. He is perhaps best known to aquarists for his collaborations with William T. Innes who wrote the classic book Exotic Aquarium Fishes. Myers served as the scientific consultant for this seminal work in the aquarium literature and, after Innes retired, served as the editor for later editions. When Myers described the neon tetra in 1936, he named it Hyphessobrycon innesi in honor of Innes. The species was later moved to the genus Paracheirodon and is now known as Paracheirodon innesi. Myers worked closely with fellow ichthyologist and Stanford Natural History Museum curator, Margaret Hamilton Storey. In the scientific field of herpetology his major interest was amphibians. A genus of Philippine snake, Myersophis, was named in his honor by Edward Harrison Taylor in 1963.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Deaths due to shootings in Premier mines and well as Jagersfontein mines led to higher publicity than other miners strikes which occurred during that time. The majority of the miners who worked at these mines were Basotho people who lived in then Basotholand. During their time working in the mines, they lived in hostels which had strict rules for black people which included the necessity for the possession of a pass book. Issues that affected Sotho people and precipitated riots included: The Great Depression, a drought over South Africa which was particularly severe over Basotholand as well as the first request that the British territories be handed over to the South African Union. The most distressing of these issues was the drought as it, compounded with the economic depression, put much pressure on migrant workers to return money back home to Basotholand.Scott Rosenberg, Richard F. Weisfelder. Historical Dictionary of Lesotho. Scarecrow Press, 13 Jun 2013 page xxv The ratio of women to men in Jagersfontein was 16:1 which was abnormal for a Free State town and as such a larger proportion of women participated in protests in Jagersfontein compared to others of its time. Nonetheless, authorities in Jagersfontein took drastic action on the women involved in the strikes including an event in March 1913 where police officials sealed off the bantu location, searched each house and demanded pass books at gun-point. Approximately 61 women were arrested, of which almost 50% were coloured. Many Basotho people fled back to Basotholand for refuge after the shootings and brutality during the riots. In 1914, the mining riots resulted in the deaths of 11 Basotho people.B Hirsun, J Wells and Judie Jancovich.

Phelps, author of \\"Praise to the Man\\". \\"Praise to the Man\\" (originally titled \\"Joseph Smith\\") is a poem written as a tribute to Joseph Smith by Latter Day Saint leader and hymn writer William W. Phelps. The poem was composed soon after Smith's death, and was later set to music and adopted as a hymn of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It was first published anonymously in the church newspaper Times and Seasons in August 1844, approximately one month after Smith was killed.Anonymous [W. W. Phelps], \\"Joseph Smith\\", Times and Seasons, 5 (1 August 1844), p. 607. The hymn is still used within the LDS Church and is hymn number 27 in the current LDS Church hymnal. Origin Phelps, the hymn's author, became involved in the Church of Christ, the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith,\\"Minutes of a Conference\\", Evening and Morning Star, vol. 2, no. 20, p. 160 (May 1832). during its time in Kirtland, Ohio, and subsequently served as a leader in Missouri before leaving the church due to unresolved financial issues and personal dissatisfaction. Declaring himself an enemy to the Mormon prophet, Phelps offered to testify against Smith in an intended Missouri trial for treason in which Smith would be the main defendant. However, the proceeding never took place, and in 1839 Smith and his associates were allowed to escape to the newly established Mormon haven of Nauvoo, Illinois.Roderick J. Linton, \\"The Forgiving Heart\\", Ensign, April 1993, p. 15. Two years later, Phelps experienced a change of heart toward Smith, and wrote him a repentant letter asking for forgiveness and a chance to rejoin the Latter Day Saints in Illinois. Smith's reply offered Phelps his full forgiveness and a return to the Latter Day Saints with no further consequences. Phelps was deeply touched by this development, and upon his return he became an enthusiastic and devoted disciple of Smith's. Phelps was invited to speak at Smith's funeral in June 1844. His poem, \\"Joseph Smith\\", followed in August of that same year, and has since become a popular Mormon hymn. Changes Part of the original text of the second verse read: \\"Long shall his blood, which was shed by assassins, / Stain Illinois, while the earth lauds his fame.\\"Smith was killed by a mob while imprisoned at Carthage, Illinois. In 1927, in accordance with its \\"good neighbor\\" policy, the LDS Church officially changed the words \\"Stain Illinois\\" to \\"Plead unto heav'n\\".George D. Pyper, Stories of the Latter-day Saint Hymns, their Authors, and Composers (1939) p. 100. Tune Phelps originally suggested \\"Star in the East\\" as the hymn tune, which is probably the same melody as \\"Star in the East\\" from Southern Harmony. The LDS hymnal now uses a melody based on \\"Scotland the Brave\\" in honor of Phelps's Scottish heritage. The tune is modified to match the syllable count of the text.

Biography He was born in Rudolstadt the second son of the reigning prince of Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt, Louis Frederick II and his wife Landgravine Caroline of Hesse- Homburg (1771‚Äì1854). His grandfather Friedrich Karl had died seven months before his birth and so he was born as heir apparent and Hereditary Prince. His father died on April 28, 1807 when he was fourteen so his mother acted as regent until he turned twenty one on November 6, 1814 when he assumed control of the principality. His reign spanning sixty years saw the creation of a Diet which he introduced in 1816 during the early years of his personal reign. When he ascended the throne in 1807, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine which was dissolved in 1813 with the Treaty of Paris on May 30, 1814 declaring the independence of the former Confederation states with Prince Friedrich G√ºnther becoming the ruler of an independent principality. In 1815 the German Confederation was created and Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt along with other German monarchies joining. The last years of his reign saw the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 where Prince Friedrich G√ºnther kept Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt neutral and following the conclusion of the war the creation of the North German Confederation. Following his death at Heidecksburg castle he was succeeded as prince by his brother Prince Albert as all of his sons by his first wife had predeceased him and his son by his second wife, Prince Sizzo of Leutenberg was born from a morganatic marriage. Marriages and children Prince Friedrich G√ºnther was married three times: His first wife was Princess Auguste of Anhalt-Dessau (1793‚Äì1854) whom he married on April 15, 1816 at Dessau. They had three children. *Prince Friedrich G√ºnther (1818‚Äì1821) *Prince G√ºnther (1821‚Äì1845) *Prince Gustav (1828‚Äì1837) He married and secondly Countess Helene of Reina (1835‚Äì1860) on August 7, 1855 at Dresden. She was a daughter of Prince George Bernhard of Anhalt-Dessau in his second morganatic marriage, but she was adopted by her paternal uncle William on April 1, 1855 and assumed the title of \\"Princess of Anhalt\\"; however, this marriage was considered morganatic under the House Laws of the Schwarzburg family, and their children were created Prince and Princess of Leutenberg.House Laws of Schwarzburg *Princess Helene (1860‚Äì1937) *Prince Sizzo (1860‚Äì1926) His third wife was Marie Schultze (1840‚Äì1909) whom he married at Schwarzburg on September 24, 1861. This marriage was also morganatic and in 1864 he created the title Countess of Brockenburg for his wife. The marriage was childless. In addition with his legitimate issue, from his relationship with Friederike Thorwart (13 March 1820 ‚Äì 18 July 1884) he had three daughters, all of whom were legally accepted as offspring of Friedrich Macheleidt (Thorwart's husband since 1847): *Marie (b.

The corpse is causing mushrooms to sprout all over the apartment and is apparently arousing suspicion among the neighbors. The audience is given no clear reason why the corpse is there. Madeleine suggests he was the lover Am√©d√©e murdered; Am√©d√©e gives several alternate explanations. At the end of the play Am√©d√©e attempts to drag the corpse away to dump it in the river. He is seen by many passers-by; one of the witnesses is referred to as \\"Eugene\\" and is likely the author himself. When Am√©d√©e becomes tangled in the legs, the corpse floats away with Am√©d√©e attached. Analysis The play contains many of Ionesco's common themes, and the characters are typical of his plays. For example, the couple's interaction is similar in many ways to the interaction between the Old Man and the Old Woman in The Chairs; the conflicting background story of the corpse parallels the old couple's conflicting stories about their children. Am√©d√©e is also in many ways the prototype of B√©renger, one of Ionesco's most commonly used characters; specifically, many of the actions and themes presage A Stroll in the Air (1963), Ionesco's fourth B√©renger play: both Am√©d√©e and B√©renger are frustrated artists, both take a moment to appreciate the beauty around them, and both fly away leaving their spouses behind.

This bird's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest. Taxonomy Some authorities advocate splitting this species into two. Carmiol's tanager (C. carmioli, including subspecies magnirostris and lutescens) is found in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and far north-western Colombia (near the Panama border). The name commemorates the Swiss scientist Julian Carmiol who worked in Costa Rica. The other species would be the olive tanager (C. frenata), which is found locally in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Description The adult olive tanager is about long and is an evenly coloured, robust bird. The upper parts are a dull olive green, and the underparts are a rather paler olive green. The throat is slightly yellower than the rest of the underparts, and is streaked in the male while being a uniform pale yellow in the female. The underparts of the female are paler than those of the male, and the female has a yellowish patch in front of the eyes. The beak is relatively stout and is dark-coloured in both sexes. The lemon- spectacled tanager looks similar, apart from its yellow facial markings, but does not share the same range as the olive tanager. Also similar is the ochre- breasted tanager (Chlorothraupis stolzmanni) but again the ranges do not overlap. Ecology The olive tanager is a gregarious bird and often forms noisy groups of a few dozen birds, sometimes including birds of other species such as the tawny-crested tanager (Tachyphonus delatrii). In Panama a typical call is a repeated \\"zhwek-zhwek-zhwek\\" but this song is replaced in Bolivia by a more melodious series of about eight notes, this being repeated several times before going on to a different phrase. The olive tanager feeds on small insects such as beetles, cockroaches and crickets, supplementing these with berries. Breeding takes place between March and May and the nest is a cup- shaped construction of plant fibres and mosses. Status The population of this bird has not been quantified but the total number of birds is thought to be declining. However, the bird is common in some areas of its extensive range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers its conservation status to be of \\"least concern\\".

He participated in ten Speedway World Championship finals, his highest placing being in his first final when he finished on the rostrum in third place after a run-off with Russian rider Gennady Kurilenko. He was also a member of the Polish World Team Cup winning team of 1969. He won the prestigious Embassy Internationale, at Wimbledon in 1977. After his riding career ended he was a speedway coach. He was trainer in Stal Gorz√≥w, KK≈ª Krosno and Polish national team. Death Jancarz' Monument On January 11, 1992 he was fatally stabbed by his second wife, Katarzyna, during a domestic dispute caused by his alcoholism he had suffered from since the mid-1980s. Since his death the Edward Jancarz Memorial has been a semi-annual meeting at the speedway that carries his name, the Edward Jancarz Stadium in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski. To date, 2010 World Champion Tomasz Gollob is the only Polish rider to win the memorial, having done so in 1998 and 1999 Edward Jancarz was the first speedway rider in the World to have a monument dedicated to them. The Monument of Edward Jancarz was built in 2005 and is in the city centre of Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski.

He was president and founder of the General American Life Insurance Company, now a part of MetLife, and president of the American Bankers Association. Head also served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America for nearly twenty years, from 1926 to 1946. Early life Walter William Head was born December 18, 1877 on a farm near Adrian, Illinois. He was the first of five children born to Alfred Walter Head and Margaret Jane Lambert. The New York Times said that Head \\"was deeply influenced by his mother, a devout woman who imbued him with a warm, human philosophy of life\\". At age 8, he moved with his family to a rural area of DeKalb County, Missouri, where he attended public schools. After graduating from Northwest Missouri State Teachers College (Maryville), Head began teaching in a one-room schoolhouse and, at age 24, was named school principal in the town of De Kalb, Missouri. Banking Head left teaching for the banking field in 1904, starting as a bank cashier at age 26. In 1917, he was named vice president of Omaha National Bank in Omaha, Nebraska, becoming the bank's president in 1920. During his time as bank president in Omaha, Walter Head also became president of the American Bankers Association and a director of New York Life Insurance Company. In 1929, Head took over as president of State Bank of Chicago. Upon his arrival, Head guided State Bank through a merger with Foreman National. When Foreman National was acquired by First National Bank in 1931, Walter Head resigned to become president of Morris Plan Corp., a New York-based banking organization making small loans to moderate income families through banks in more than 100 U.S. cities. At the time, Morris Plan was the largest industrial banking system in the U.S., with $200 million in annual business and 800,000 customers. Insurance Head left banking in 1933, when he became the first president of Great American Life Insurance Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The new company was formed by Equity Corporation, controlled by David Milton (son- in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr.). Equity had acquired the business of Missouri State Life in bankruptcy court in September, 1933, following Missouri State Life's collapse during the Great Depression. Milton recruited Head to be the founder and first president of General American Life and take over Missouri State Life's business. Head continued as president of Great American Life Insurance until January, 1951, when he was succeeded by P. B. McHaney. Civic Walter W. Head at the White House with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Chief Scout Executive James E. West announcing the first national Scout jamboree Head was appointed by Nebraska Governor Samuel R.

Head served as fourth and sixth national president of the Boy Scouts of America. His first term was from 1926‚Äì1931. His successor, Mortimer L. Schiff died after one month in office; Head then served from 1931-1946. During his presidency, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) held its first national Scout jamboree in Washington, D. C..

It is endemic to eastern Australia. Its natural habitat is temperate forests. Taxonomy The speckled warbler was first described by English physician and ornithologist John Latham in 1801. It was earlier grouped with the scrubwrens in Sericornis and then in the monotypic genus Chthonicola. Morphological similarities and DNA studies now place it as a sister taxon with the redthroat in the genus Pyrrholaemus.Gardner, J.L., Trueman, J.W.H., Ebert, D., Joseph, L. and Magrath, R.D. (2010). \\"Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds.\\" Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 55(3): 1087‚Äì1102.

The specific epithet is the Latin sagittatus 'shot with arrows', referring to the bird's streaked chest. Other common names are blood tit, chocolate-bird, little fieldwren and speckled jack.Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney.

Ringwood, Victoria: Penguin Books Australia . It has an off-white face, streaked with buffy-brown on the ear coverts, and the crown is brown with white speckles. The eye is brown, the bill is dark grey-brown, and the legs are pinkish-brown. The male has a black upper margin to the brow, whereas on the female it is reddish- brown.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. The plumage of the upperparts is grey-brown with darker streaks.Slater, Peter (1974) A Field Guide to Australian Birds: Passerines. Adelaide: Rigby. The tail is dark-brown with a black subterminal band and white tips, and it is usually held horizontally. The underparts are yellowish-white and heavily streaked with black. The juvenile is similar to the female, but the top of its head is more diffusely spotted. Distribution and Habitat The speckled warbler is found in southeastern Australia. It is patchily distributed in Queensland, roughly southeast of a line between Mackay and Charleville, being somewhat more common towards the extreme southeast of the state. In New South Wales, it occurs throughout the New England Tablelands and the South West Slopes, extending westward to the Pilliga Scrub and to Griffith in the Riverina, and eastwards into the Hunter Valley. It is fairly common in the Australian Capital Territory. In Victoria, the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the Chiltern Box-Ironbark and Warby- Ovens National Parks, the Bendigo region, the Brisbane Ranges and You Yangs, across to Balmoral on the western side of the Grampians. It is scarce to moderately common within its range. Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery. Behaviour The speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it will make a grating twitter and fly to a perch, then soon return to foraging on the ground. Its song is soft, mellow and musical, interspersed with sharp whistles, somewhat like that of the western gerygone (Gerygone fusca). It is also a mimic of other species. Like the redthroat (Pyrrholaemus brunneus), the speckled warbler makes a distinctive whirring sound with its wings in flight. Breeding The breeding season is from August to January. It builds a dome-shaped nest with a side-entrance in a slight hollow, near the base of a tree or dense shrub, or among fallen branches. The nest is loosely built of dried grass, bark-shreds and moss, often lined with feathers and fur, and resembling the surrounding debris. It lays a clutch of 3 or 4 eggs, each measuring . The eggs are a reddish- chocolate colour, darker at the large end. The female incubates the eggs for 17-20 days, and then broods the hatchlings. The nestlings are fed by her and the primary male for 15-19 days. The nests are parasitised by the fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and the black-eared cuckoo (Chrysococcyx osculans). Diet and Foraging It feeds on the ground, often in the company of other birds (mixed species flocks), such as the buff-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza reguloides), eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis), white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis), spotted pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus), weebill (Smicrornis brevirostris), and silver-eye (Zosterops lateralis). It is mainly insectivorous, but occasionally eats seeds. Its chief prey are beetles (Coleoptera), wasps and winged ants (Hymenoptera), moth and butterfly larvae (Lepidoptera), mantids and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Conservation status Although relatively abundant with a population estimated at 400,000, the speckled warbler appears to be declining within its range. Threats include land clearance, leading to the advent of invasive weeds and increased predator pressure, as well as over-grazing and salinization with consequent fragmentation and degradation of habitat. Drought and fire also pose ongoing threats. On the IUCN Red List, the speckled warbler was uplisted from near threatened to least concern status in 2000, having found to be more common than previously believed. In October 2016, it continued to be assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.BirdLife International 2016. \\"Pyrrholaemus sagittatus.\\" The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2016: e.T22728490A94988404. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-3.RLTS.T22728490A94988404.en.

It was created by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB) to standardize GPU instructions controlling the hardware graphics pipeline. History Texas Instruments created the first programmable graphics processor in 1985: the TMS34010, which allowed developers to load and execute code on the processor to control pixel output on a video display. This was followed by the TMS34020 and TMS34082 in 1989, providing programmable 3D graphics output. NVIDIA released its first video card NV1 in 1995, which supported quadratic texture mapping. This was followed by the Riva 128 (NV3) in 1997, providing the first hardware acceleration for Direct3D. Various video card vendors released their own accelerated boards, each with their own instruction set for GPU operations. The OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB) was formed in 1992, in part to establish standards for the GPU industry. The ARB and NVIDIA established a number of OpenGL extensions to standardize GPU programming: * EXT_texture_env_combine - provided a programmable method of combining textures. * NV_register_combiners - GeForce 256 * NV_vertex_program - GeForce 3 * NV_texture_shader - GeForce 3 * NV_texture_shader3 - GeForce 4 * NV_vertex_program2 - GeForce FX * NV_fragment_program - GeForce FX This culminated with ARB's 2002 release of * ARB_vertex_program * ARB_fragment_program These two extensions provided an industry standard for an assembly language that controlled the GPU pipeline for 3D vertex and interpolated pixel properties, respectively. Subsequent high-level shading languages sometimes compile to this ARB standard. While 3D developers are now more likely to use a C-like, high-level shading language for GPU programming, ARB assembly has the advantage of being supported on a wide range of hardware. Note however that some features, such as loops and conditionals, are not available in ARB assembly, and using them requires to adopt either the NV_gpu_program4 extension, or the GLSL shading language. All major graphics card manufacturers have supported ARB assembly language for years, since the NVIDIA Geforce FX series, the AMD R300-based cards (Radeon 9500 series and higher), and the Intel GMA 900. However, standard ARB assembly language is only at the level of Pixel Shader 2.0 and predates GLSL, so it has very few features. While nVidia has made proprietary extensions to ARB assembly languages that combine the fast compile speed of ARB assembly with modern OpenGL 3.x features, introduced with the GeForce 8 Series, most non- nVidia OpenGL implementations do not provide the proprietary nVidia extensions to ARB assembly language and do not offer any other way to access all the shader features directly in assembly, forcing the use of GLSL even for machine generated shaders where assembly would be more appropriate. Details ARB_vertex_program The ARB Vertex Program extension provides APIs to load ARBvp1.0 assembly instructions, enable selected programs, and to set various GPU parameters. Vertex programs are used to modify vertex properties, such as position, normals and texture coordinates, that are passed to the next pipeline process: often a fragment shader; more recently, a geometry shader. ARB_fragment_program The ARB Fragment Program extension provides APIs to load ARBfp1.0 assembly instructions, enable selected programs, and to set various GPU parameters. OpenGL fragments are interpolated pixel definitions. The GPU's vertex processor calculates all the pixels controlled by a set of vertices, interpolates their position and other properties and passes them onto its fragment process. Fragment programs allow developers to modify these pixel properties before they are rendered to a frame buffer for display. OpenGL Parameters * Attrib parameters are per-vertex attributes such as vertex normals. * Local parameters are applied across a program's entire data set for a given shader pass. * Env parameters are applied across all programs. ARB Variables All ARB assembly variables are float4 vectors, which may be addressed by xyzw or rgba suffixes. Registers are scalar variables where only one element may be addressed. * ADDRESS variables are registers. * ATTRIB are per-vertex attributes. * PARAM are uniform properties - constants, Env or Local. * TEMP temporary variables. * ALIAS provides alternate names for variables. * OUTPUT designates variables that are passed back to the pipeline. Vertex Attributes ARB assembly supports the following suffixes for vertex attributes: * position * weight * normal * color * * texcoord * matrixindex * attrib State Matrices ARB assembly supports the following state matrices: * modelview * projection * texture * palette * program The following modifiers may be used: * inverse * transpose * ARB Assembly Instructions ARB assembly supports the following instructions: * ABS - absolute value * ADD - add * ARL - address register load * DP3 - 3-component dot product * DP4 - 4-component dot product * DPH - homogeneous dot product * DST - distance vector * EX2 - exponential base 2 * EXP - exponential base 2 (approximate) * FLR - floor * FRC - fraction * LG2 - logarithm base 2 * LIT - compute light coefficients * LOG - logarithm base 2 (approximate) * MAD - multiply and add * MAX - maximum * MIN - minimum * MOV - move * MUL - multiply * POW - exponentiate * RCP - reciprocal * RSQ - reciprocal square root * SGE - set on greater than or equal * SLT - set on less than * SUB - subtract * SWZ - extended swizzle * TEX - Texture lookup * XPD - cross product This is only a partial list of assembly instructions ; a reference can be found here : Shader Assembly Language (ARB/NV) Quick Reference Guide for OpenGL. ARB assembly provides no instructions for flow control or branching. SGE and SLT may be used to conditionally set or clear vectors or registers. ARB interfaces provide no compiling step for assembly language. GL_NV_fragment_program_option extends the ARB_fragment_program language with additional instructions. GL_NV_fragment_program2, GL_NV_vertex_program2_option and GL_NV_vertex_program3 extend it further.

Elokomin was launched on 19 October 1943 by Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 721); sponsored by Mrs. C. M. Marcey; transferred to the Navy on 30 January 1943; and commissioned on 30 November 1943, Commander J. A. Ivaldi, USNR, in command.  World War II Atlantic Ocean operations  From January to August 1944 Elokomin was almost constantly at sea transporting fuel oil, diesel oil, and gasoline from Gulf ports to Norfolk, Virginia, New York City, Argentia, Newfoundland, and Bermuda. On 2 September she sailed with a convoy for Oran, Algeria, refueling the convoy escorts during the passage and discharging fuel oil to the dock at Oran upon arrival. She reached Bermuda 14 October, and after discharging the remainder of her cargo, returned to Norfolk 4 days later. Two similar voyages were made to Casablanca after which she served as station tanker at Bermuda in March and April 1945. Elokomin returned to coastwise and Caribbean duty until the end of the war. She continued on active service and from her base at Norfolk, operated mainly along the east coast and on fleet exercises. She alternated this duty with U.S. 6th Fleet tours in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises in European waters through 1962.  Decommissioning  She was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on unknown dates. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at another unknown date. Her final disposition was that she was scrapped in 1970.

Geographic range  Laborde's Chameleon is associated with spiny and deciduous forests in the south-west regions of Madagascar. Life cycle Like other Furcifer species (F. antimena, F. lateralis), F. labordi has an obligate year-long lifecycle. It lives for only about 4 to 5 months, making it the shortest lifespan ever recorded for a four-legged vertebrate.Natural history: Nasty, brutish and short . In their natural habitat, eggs hatch with the first rains in November, the growth is rapid, and adulthood is reached by January, at which time they breed. By late February or early March, females have deposited the eggs which will hatch the next year, and the entire population dies until the next hatching. No other tetrapod has exhibited such a short lifespan. In captivity In captivity, eggs of F. labordi have hatched after 4 months of incubation at . Juveniles grow very rapidly, reaching adulthood after 3 months. Females that were properly fed grew with eggs and a vivid coloration, whereas females that were fed a less caloric diet grew thinner and only showed a green coloration.

Description The Chilean seaside cinclodes grows to a length of about . The upper parts are mainly a dark sooty brown, with a narrow whitish superciliary stripe and pale tips to the outer tail feathers. The wings have a rufous-buff bar that is chiefly visible in flight. The chin, throat and sides of the neck are white while the breast and belly are brown, streaked with white. The beak is charcoal grey and slightly curved and the rather short legs are dark grey. Distribution and habitat This bird is endemic to Chile where it lives on the coast, typically on rocky shores with boulders and tidepools. Its range extends from Arica to Valdivia. Ecology Chilean seaside cinclodes bob their tail as they walk. They have a loud trilling song, often uttered from the top of a boulder, and often flare their wings as they sing. They forage singly or in pairs, searching along the foreshore for the small crustaceans and other invertebrates on which they feed, often hunting in surf-exposed places. Breeding takes place in August and September. The nest is built in a rock crevice or in a hole excavated in an earth bank and is formed out of grasses, with two to four white eggs being laid.

Its breeding habits are not well known, but the nest is usually hidden in a rock crevice. Status As a result of a survey in 2003, the number of birds was estimated to be in the range 200‚Äì1000. No previously unknown locations were found. Between 2008 and 2011, further survey work was undertaken; 104 bogs were visited and 113 birds were recorded inhabiting 18 of them, giving an estimated total population of birds of under 300. Their habitat is being disturbed by mining activities and the dumping of spoil from mines, the extraction of peat, and overgrazing by alpacas, llamas and sheep. If these activities continue there is a poor outlook for the birds, and as a result the International Union for Conservation of Nature have assessed them as being \\"critically endangered\\".

L.H.D. (February 2, 1874 ‚Äì February 27, 1969) was an American aquarist, author, photographer, printer and publisher. Innes was the author of numerous influential books and hundreds of articles about aquarium fish, aquatic plants and aquarium maintenance during the formative years of the aquarium hobby in America. Born in Philadelphia, he was the founder, publisher and editor of The Aquarium, the first successful national magazine on the subject of keeping freshwater tropical fishes. The magazine ran monthly for thirty-five years from May 1932 through January 1967. Graduating from Friends' Central School, Philadelphia, he entered the printing concern of his father, in 1895.poster time-line \\"William T. Innes: The Aquarium Life\\" In 1899 he married Mary Weber Weaver. From the 1920s he organized aquarium shows in Philadelphia's Horticultural Hall. Exotic Aquarium Fishes Original Innes is best remembered as author and publisher of the book, Exotic Aquarium Fishes, which was printed by his family's printing firm in Philadelphia in 1935 and went through nineteen editions. It quickly became the seminal work on the subject and has often been called 'the aquarium bible.' Beautifully produced with many lavish elements by his own printing firm, and written in a simple but elegant and compelling style by Innes alone, the book also included photographs taken by Innes for each of the fish species. He had decided that the Kodachrome film of the day required too much light and did not accurately show the true colors of various fishes. Instead, he shot black-and-white photographs that were hand-painted, test-printed, and then repainted to fine-tune the color for publication. Images These color plates, considered works of art by many, became the object of an infamous lawsuit some years later. Dr Innes was shocked to learn that Dr Herbert Axelrod had used these now-famous plates from Exotic Aquarium Fishes in a book produced by his publishing company, TFH Publications. Innes sued. He won the case in 1955, but was awarded only $1, plus court costs, since the court could not determine that any monetary damage had been done. Later editions Innes held the desire that the book would be updated on a regular basis, even after his death, and collaborated with younger friend and colleague, Dr. George S. Myers, to that end. After Innes Publishing ended its production of the book, other entities published more economical editions identified as the '19th edition, revised.' When Innes failed to renew the copyright of the first edition, Axelrod quickly took advantage of the situation and published a new version of the classic. All of these editions lack the production quality of the original nineteen editions published by Innes, which remain to this day highly collectable and widely used by aquarists. They can be identified by their dark green, 'leatherette' covers and binding, featuring an image of a trio of harlequin rasboras stamped in 14k gold. Other work Other books for which he served as author, publisher, principal photographer and printer include Goldfish Varieties and Tropical Aquarium Fishes (1917) which ran through fifteen editions by 1935; The Modern Aquarium (1929); Your Aquarium (1945); Goldfish Varieties and Water Gardens (1947); and Aquarium Highlights (1951). Honors Dr. Myers, who first described the neon tetra, had named that fish Hyphessobrycon innesi in honor of Innes. This popular aquarium species was later moved to the genus Paracheirodon and is now known as Paracheirodon innesi. The neon tetra is perhaps the best-known of several fish species that have been named in honor of this pioneer in the aquarium hobby. A water lily cultivar of the genus Nymphaea has also been named in his honor. Temple University conferred upon him the Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1951. On the occasion of Dr. Innes's 80th birthday in 1954, Dr. Myers wrote a tribute to him, in the February issue of The Aquarium, referring to William T. Innes as \\"the best known and most respected aquarist and authority on aquariums in the world. His books, his photographs and his influence on this field have educated millions.\\" An extensive collection of his writings, sketches, photographs and correspondence is housed at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

Its natural habitats are rivers and rocky shores. The dark-bellied cinclodes is distributed in Chile from about Santiago southwards to Tierra del Fuego and in adjacent areas of extreme western Argentina. It is found near streams, lakes and marshlands from sea level up to 2,500 m. It has a bold white supercilium and throat. Description The dark-bellied cinclodes grows to a length of about . The upper parts are mainly a sooty brown, with a broad white superciliary stripe and pale buff tips to the outer tail feathers. The wings have buff wing-bars which are chiefly visible in flight. The chin, throat and sides of the neck are white flecked with dusky grey while the breast and belly are greyish- brown, with the breast streaked with white. The beak is charcoal grey and slightly curved and the rather short legs are dark grey. Distribution and habitat This species is native to the southern tip of South America, its range extending from Valpara√≠so in Chile southwards to Tierra del Fuego and southwestern Argentina. In the northern part of its range it is found in the Andean foothills at altitudes of up to , but further south, its altitudinal range descends to the sea. It is usually found near water, on lake shores, riverbanks, streamsides and on coasts. Ecology Chilean seaside cinclodes often cock their tails as they walk. They forage singly or in pairs, searching for the small crustaceans and other invertebrates on which they feed. Breeding takes place between September and December. The nest is built in such places as a rock crevice, a stone wall, an animal burrow, a tree hole or on a bridge girder, and is formed out of grasses, with two to four white eggs being laid. Status The dark-bellied cinclodes has a very wide range and is described as fairly common. The population trend seems to be steady, and the total population is large.

IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.2. International Union for Conservation of Nature. Retrieved 26 November 2013.  Distribution  The chestnut-breasted quail-thrush is found in northwestern New South Wales, western Queensland and much of Western Australia. It occurs predominantly within semi-arid zones featuring sparse woody shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and hummock grasses.  Breeding  The chestnut-breasted quail-thrush breeds during the winter semester. Eggs have been reported being laid at the end of months which have received heavy rain in the early weeks.  Nesting  The chestnut-breasted quail-thrush predominantly lays two eggs per clutch in a nest located on the ground in a slight depression. It is usually 5 cm deep and 15 cm wide and constructed of mulga leaves and hop-bush bark Dodonoea adenophora. The nests are hidden amongst a low hop bush which was part of a Mulga-Box association. The nest is usually hidden behind a curtain of leaves and bark. The nests are frequented by related mature and juvenile individuals, however, only the mature individuals feed the young. If juveniles came too close to the nest they are often chased away by the mature male. Juveniles are distinguishable by their smaller size and incomplete bar below the chestnut breast. All nest attendees, including hatchlings will render themselves motionless in the presence of predators such as crows Corvus orru and the wedge-tailed eagle Aquila audax. They have also been known to chase away crested bellbirds Oreoica gutturalis, grey-crowned babblers Pomatostomus temporalis, chestnut-crowned babblers Pomatostomus ruficeps and Hall's babblers Pomatostomus halli.  Call  Common call: Piping whistle of two and three short notes. This is not made by the female. When alarmed: One or two insect like noises, sounding similar to the call of the Myzomela nigra. This is made by both sexes.  Taxonomy  Cinclosoma is best described as two clusters of taxa. The first most closely related cluster consisting of C. cinnamomeurn, C. alisteri, C. castaneothorax and C. marginatum. The second cluster which is less related consists of C. punctatum, C. ajax and C. castanotum. The first cluster has developed due to allopatric speciation and sub-speciation within Australia's deserts. The second cluster has occurred due to parapatry between semi-arid and wet country. The territories of many subspecies overlap both temporally and spatially, yet the parapatric borders between C. cinnamomeum and C. castaneothorax coincide with sharp environmental changes removing competition between the two subspecies. It is believed that all Cinclosoma taxa share a common ancestor which lived in Australia's warm wet forests. It's descendants spread across Australia's deserts through a leapfrog distribution pattern of evolution. This pattern of distribution is believed to be the reason for all semi-arid Cinclosoma taxa sharing camouflaged plumage.Ford, J. (1983). Evolutionary and ecological relationships between quail-thrushes. Emu, 83(3), 152-172. https://doi.org/10.1071/MU9830152  Sexual dimorphism  Male and female chestnut-breasted quail-thrushes are identifiable due to their different plumage. ‚Ä¢ Male plumage: glossy black throat; rich rust-red breast band edged with black; eyebrow buff; the rump and back are a deep rust-red, black underside. ‚Ä¢ Female plumage: Throat and malar region are orange-buff, eyebrow is the same colour. The breast is pale brown and merges into a dull- cinnamon on the flanks. Underside is an olive-brown and rum reddish-brown with indistinct darker streaks.

Description Similar in physical appearance to other species such as Cinclosoma cinnamomeum and C.c. punctatum, the chestnut quail-thrush is a medium-sized bird that resides in the lower canopy and scrub of arid and semi- arid vegetation. The male is characterised by a rich, yellow chestnut breast, yellow to chestnut flank, with a black band that separates the white belly from the breast. The female differs with a deeper, lighter throat that lacks the black band that separates the belly from the chest, presenting an overall duller hue than the male.

Illustration of male (below) and female (above) Chestnut Quail- Thrush Taxonomy The family Cinclosomatidae is characterised by terrestrial birds that prefer the safety of the ground to the wide arena of the air. They are often observed squatting and running along the ground, usually foraging. The birds of this family ‚Äì those that include jewel-babblers and wedgebills ‚Äì also prefer the ground for nesting purposes. The Cinclosoma castanotum species was discovered by John Gould in 1840 and was labelled so in order to draw attention to the patch of chestnut on the lower back of the bird.Gray, J. & Fraser, I. (2013) Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide. CSIRO Publishing: Australia The race marginatum is the ‚Äòwestern quail-thrush‚Äô ‚Äì adopting a richer plumage and found around the majority of inland Western Australia. The moniker castanotum derives from the Greek word kastanon meaning chestnut and noton meaning the back. The other quail-thrush that share the same genus are distributed through the arid and semi-arid areas of Central Australia, as well as more temperate and tropical areas in northern Australia and New Guinea.Toon, A. et al. (2012) \\"Evolution of arid zone birds in Australia: Leapfrog distribution patterns and mesic-arid connections in quail-thrush (Cinclosoma, Cinclosomatidae)\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Vol. 62. Elsevier: The Netherlands. pp. 286-295 The most notable species include the painted quail-thrush (Cinclosoma ajax), spotted quail-thrush (C.c. punctatum), chestnut quail-thrush (C.c. castanotum), cinnamon quail-thrush (C.c. cinnamomeum), and chestnut-breasted quail-thrush (C.c. castaneothorax). It has been suggested that the quail-thrush found in arid zones originate from their forest ancestors in the tropical reaches of northern Australia and the Guinea lowlands, changing as the climate shifted from a wet climate to a cooler, dryer climate in the late Miocene. Despite this, there remains some debate as to the origin and taxonomical relationship between the arid and tropical species due to the stark difference in habitat and environment. A study in 2015 found the divergence between species using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), characterising each group through spatial and phylogenetic qualities.Dolman, G. & Joseph, L. (2015) \\"Evolutionary history of birds across southern Australia: structure, history and taxonomic implications of mitochondrial DNA diversity in an ecologically diverse suite of species\\". Emu - Austral Ornithology, Vol. 115. pp - 35-48. DOI: 10.1071/MU14047 The study concluded that populations of Cinclosoma castanotum east of the Eyrean Barrier were to remain their original taxonomical moniker, while those west of the Eyrean Barrier were split into C. c. clarum, C. c. fordianum or into phenotypically intermediate subspecies. In addition to the divergence in mtDNA, there was a difference in dorsal colouration caused by sexual dimorphism in species found to the east and west of the Eyrean Barrier ‚Äì helping to define the taxonomical separations.Ford, J. R. (1981). \\"Geographic variation in Cinclosoma castanotum and its historical significance\\". Emu 81, 185‚Äì192. doi:10.1071/MU9810185 Distribution and Habitat The chestnut quail-thrush occurs in a relatively large area across the interior of Australia, covering both semi-arid and arid landscapes. The nominate species of Cinclosoma castanotum is found in central Queensland, extending down through the New South Wales border and continuing south as far as Cobar. The race marginatum occurs from the far southwest corner of the Northern Territory across to Shark Bay in WA and as far south as Kalgoorlie. The distribution and habitats of the chestnut quail-thrush is naturally fragmented due to natural landscape breaks, such as the Eyrean Barrier, Murchison Barrier and the desert landscapes of the Yellabinna Region ‚Äì landscapes that do not support mallee or heathland and thus a lack of suitable habitat. The traditional habitat of the chestnut quail-thrush is scrub and low-lying vegetation, such as mulga- eucalyptus and acacias that reside on stony ground, as well as grevilleas and tea trees on rocky hillocks. There is a variance between habitat enjoyed by species inhabiting NSW and those in WA, with the former occurring exclusively in mallee woodlands that feature spinifex and acacia shrubs, while the latter enjoys an understorey habitat characterised by sclerophyll woodlands, acacia shrubs and heathland. Their relationship to fire regimes varies with the highest densities occurring between two and fifteen years, while densities have been observed to drop when fire intervals fall below two years. Distribution map of the Chestnut Quail-Thrush Behaviour and Diet The chestnut quail-thrush is a largely ground-based bird that favours the understorey over the canopy in order to forage, nest and hide from predators. They are a locally nomadic bird that prefers to run than fly ‚Äì with or without disturbance. They are a diurnal species that forages during the day and are often seen in pairs or small family groups when foraging, nesting or singing. It has been observed that, as with other quail-thrush, they can be easily confused with a babbler when running.Smith, B. & Smith, M. (2019) Ellura Sanctuary - Birds. Accessed 4 June Easily disturbed from external activity, the chestnut quail-thrush is difficult to follow and has a practiced skill in hiding in undergrowth and scrub when threatened. The Cinclosoma castanotum is an omnivore species that feeds on a combination of ground-laden insects and seeds. They are often observed foraging through clumps of spinifex chasing insects such as grasshoppers, beetles and caterpillars, both native and exotic seed, as well as the fruit of various native plants. Reproduction Chestnut quail-thrush adopt the same breeding season as other quail-thrush ‚Äì from July to August ‚Äì with the males singing from daybreak throughout the breeding seasonChapman, G. (2016) \\"Chestnut quail-thrush\\". Australian Birds. Accessed 4 June. In between August and December (depending on rainfall) they lay in between 2 and 3 eggs that are cream to white in colour with blackish brown spots covering the surface.BiodiversityWatch (2017) BirdWatch. Accessed 4 June They are a ground nesting bird that makes their nest in a small depression using surrounding foliage and vegetation, such as bark, grass and sticks. Threats and Conservation The chestnut quail-thrush is listed as Least Concern under the IUCN guidelines and is in no immediate danger of extinction. Despite this, it has gone into decline in some parts of WA. This decline spreads along the western range of the marginatum contingent, specifically Kellerberrin, Dryandra and large parts of the Western Australia wheatbelt.Fulton, G.

The species ‚Äì and genus at large - are vulnerable to a variety of threats, including: land clearing leading to habitat loss, fragmentation and genetic isolation; the degradation of habitat due to adjacent or immediate human activity; predation from invasive pests, such as cats and foxes; the direct and indirect challenges faced by inappropriate fire regimes, including rapid landscape change; and the unknown future threats driven by anthropogenic climate change. Potential conservation assistance strategies have been suggested, centring on reducing the stocking rates in and around potential and real habitat; retention of remnant grasslands and shrubland, aggressive control of invasive predators, and the implementation and maintenance of a sustainable fire plan.

Career Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, on 11 September 1988, O'Brien attended Holy Trinity Senior School in the town. His younger brother, Adam O'Brien, is a professional rugby league footballer with Huddersfield Giants . O'Brien grew up as a Bradford City fan and joined the club's Centre Of Excellence when he was eight-years-old, and signed professional terms at the age of 18. He was twice awarded The David Bairstow Trophy which is given to a young player at the club (Under 8's to Under 16's) who have excelled themselves. He was also awarded the Youth Players Player of the Year aged 17. He travelled with the first team squad for the first time aged only 16. He made his debut for Bradford City as a second-half substitute against Doncaster Rovers on 4 September 2007 in the Football League Trophy. His first start came in a 3‚Äì0 FA Cup defeat to Tranmere Rovers at Valley Parade on 1 December 2007. He made his league debut towards the end of the first season when he deputised for Paul Heckingbottom in a 2‚Äì2 with Brentford on 12 April 2008. He was one of three junior players to be offered a new deal by manager Stuart McCall on 29 April 2008, and was the first of the three to sign his new deal. He played his first game of the 2008‚Äì09 season as a second-half substitute against Luton Town, following fellow left-back Paul Heckingbottom's red card. He kept his place in the side and went on to score his first senior goal when he opened the scoring in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Rotherham United at the Don Valley Stadium on 22 November 2008. His form also helped him to win the PFA Fans' League Two player of the month in December. O'Brien said: \\"It is great to win an award like this, especially so early in my career, and the fact that it is voted for by supporters makes it that little bit more special.\\" He followed it up with consecutive nominations in the following two months. Former Bradford City player John Hendrie said O'Brien should win the club's player of the season award because of his consistency to win a regular first-team place. Hendrie said: \\"He defends well and has also got the energy and desire to overlap going forward and get crosses in the box.\\" O'Brien was voted Bradford City Player of the Year, Supporters Club Player of the Year, Under 25's Player of the Year and the Alan Hannah Trophy (Players Player of the Year) for the 2008/2009 season. In May 2009 O'Brien's fine individual effort at Rotherham United was voted Goal of the Season 2008/2009 by Bradford City supporters in a recent online poll. The left back's stunning strike back in November at the Don Valley Stadium beat off 7 other contenders to win the award and this adds to his growing list of honours collected for the 2008/2009 season. O'Brien playing for Bradford City in 2009 O'Brien's contract was due to expire at the end of the 2008/2009 season, he signed a 1-year deal in June 2009 to take his contract to the end of June 2010. The second goal of his career came against Barnet on 17 April 2010 at Valley Parade. He came on with 15 minutes remaining, scored within 4 minutes then set up Michael Flynn for the winner to give Bradford City the 2‚Äì1 result. He said \\"It was so special to see it go in. Ive always wanted to score like that in front of the kop.\\". O'Brien appeared in 49 of the club's 2009‚Äì10 season, starting 45 and coming off the bench 4 times. In June 2010, he signed a new two-year deal, the deal also includes the option for the football club to extend his contract into a third year if they wish. O'Brien made the most appearances in the club's 2010‚Äì11 season with a total of 46, starting 41 and coming off the bench 5 times. He also had the club's most assists in all competitions with 6. At the start of the 2011 season, Luke did not feature under Peter Jackson. His first appearance of the season came against Sheffield Wednesday on 30 August 2011 coming on for the last 5 minutes of the game, replacing Jack Compton. O'Brien joined League One side Exeter City on 31 January 2012 for an undisclosed fee as a direct replacement for the departed Scott Golbourne. O'Brien made 149 appearances since making his debut in September 2007 for Bradford City, he also scored 2 goals. Luke made his league debut against Stevenage at St James Park on 3 March 2012. The game finished 1‚Äì1, O'Brien played the full 90 minutes. O'Brien was released by Exeter City in May 2012.

This small to medium-sized species of bird is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia.  Taxonomy  This species is a member of the family Psophodidae, which is a group of passerine bird's native to Australia and nearby areas. The quail- thrushes (Cinclosoma), which the cinnamon quail-thrush is a part of, belong to this family.  Description  Cinnamon quail-thrush have a body-length of 20 cm, and weigh up to 50 grams when fully grown. Male birds are characterised by a white eyebrow, black face and a broad white streak down the sides of a black throat. The upperparts of their body are plain cinnamon-rufous with buff-white patches on the upper breast and a broad black band below. The outer tail feathers are black with white tips. The female has similar features but duller with a buff-white throat and eyebrow. Their upper breast is grey and they have no black on the underside. Juveniles have the same markings but males may have an indistinct breast band.Simpson, Ken (1999).‚Äô‚ÄôField Guide to the Birds of Australia‚Äô‚Äô, p. 212.Penguin Books, Australia. . They have high-pitched, slightly hissing calls (voices).  Distribution and habitat  The cinnamon quail-thrush is an Australian endemic that is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia. These regions are defined by the presence of desert vegetation and land forms as well as by low rainfall, with less than 500 mm per annum in most areas. Its distribution size is estimated to be 831,000 kilometres square, spanning over southwest Queensland, northwest New South Wales, northeastern South Australia and the southeast of the Northern Territory. Within these areas the cinnamon quail-thrush has been found in grass and shrublands, however it is more commonly found among dry stony areas, especially around dry creek lines.  Behaviour and ecology   Behaviour  These terrestrial birds are fairly weak fliers and prefer to squat or run when disturbed.  Diet  The cinnamon quail-thrush are exclusively ground foragers, eating a wide range of invertebrates (including grasshoppers, bugs, beetles, flies and ants), and seeds of both native and introduced flora species.  Breeding  These birds are found alone, in pairs or small family groups. Males sing continuously at daybreak in the breeding season, which is normally between the months of July and August. Breeding occurs on the ground, with cup-shaped nests being built in depressions and lined with strips of bark, fine grass or sticks. The nest is usually located amongst rocky areas, against fallen branches or under low bushes or sparse tufts of grass. The clutch can contain two or three eggs.  Migration  There is no evidence of the cinnamon quail-thrush having large- scale seasonal movements.  Conservation status  While the cinnamon quail- thrush's population has not been measured, it is thought that species is slowly declining due to ongoing habitat degradation caused by livestock and introduced herbivores. The species is listed under least concern on the ICUN Red List of Threatened Species.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The poet says that his feeble lines cannot do justice to the subject's beauty, but merely mar it with their own inadequacy. The poet's only achievements are the result of that beauty, which is much more clearly visible simply by looking in a mirror. Structure Sonnet 103 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 7th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / That over-goes my blunt invention quite, / √ó √ó / √ó /√ó / √ó / Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. (103.7-8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. This is followed (in line 8) by a common metrical variation: the initial reversal, which also occurs in line 6.

These are mostly based on clippings from newspapers sent in by readers, often for a cash fee.  Birtspeak 2.0  A column giving examples of especially convoluted and impenetrable jargon from the BBC. Named for former Director-General of the BBC John Birt, who was particularly associated with that kind of language. Following his departure, extracts are almost always taken from BBC job adverts or press releases announcing senior BBC appointments. The column features an illustration of a Dalek, a reference to Dennis Potter's 1993 James MacTaggart Memorial lecture where he described Birt (alongside Marmaduke Hussey) as a \\"croak-voiced Dalek\\".  Colemanballs  A collection of gaffes from radio and TV perpetrated by sports commentators and sportsmen, featuring inconsistencies, mixed metaphors, or otherwise ludicrous statements, such as \\"he's missed the goal by literally a million miles\\" or \\"if they played like this every week they wouldn't be so inconsistent\\". This feature originally specialised in quotes from British sports commentator David Coleman, for whom the column is named, but expanded to quotes from others, notably including Murray Walker. The name of this feature has since spawned derivative collections such as \\"Warballs\\" (spurious references to the September 11, 2001 attacks), \\"Dianaballs\\" (unduly sentimental references to Diana, Princess of Wales). Any other subject can be covered, as long as it is appropriately suffixed by -balls, such as Tsunamiballs. Colemanballs has now been renamed \\"Commentatorballs\\".  Dumb Britain  Bizarre, ignorant or otherwise humorous answers to questions given by contestants on British television and radio quiz shows, compiled by Marcus Berkmann. Occasionally, Dumb America, Dumb Ireland, Dumb Australia and other countries are also featured.  Eye Spy  Pictures sent in by readers showing contradictory, ironic, amusing, scatological, or otherwise amusing images. For example, a temporary \\"Polling Station\\" sign situated next to a \\"Do not sit on the fence\\" notice, and an Indonesian restaurant named \\"Caffe Bog\\".  Going Live  Highlighting the often unnecessary use by rolling news programmes of outside broadcasts, where reporters speak to camera simply as an alternative to broadcasting a studio- based commentary, even if they have no insight to offer from the scene.  Harsh Words  An occasional series devoted to unusual callousness in public, such as a former neighbour of Jill Dando remarking that, \\"the shooting left a horrible atmosphere here for a while. It made you aware of all the terrible things that go on. But I don't think it has affected house prices.\\"  Just Fancy That!  A spot highlighting contradictions or hypocrisy in pairs of statements from individuals or newspapers.  Lookalikes  The letters page usually features a submission comparing two famous individuals who look alike; frequently the two have an ironic connection too which is pointed out by the reader who submits the piece. The captions relating to the two individuals are invariably swapped around, implying that even the magazine cannot tell which individual is which. The sender often finishes with the phrase \\"might they perhaps be related?\\" and/or \\"I think we should be told.\\" This feature was copied by the American Spy magazine in its \\"Separated at Birth?\\" section. On one occasion, Robert Maxwell successfully sued the Eye for printing a made-up letter 'lookaliking' him with one of the Kray twins. Although the comparison was deemed an artistic interpretation and not amenable at law, the facts that (a) the letter had been composed by Richard Ingrams and (b) that the magazine often hinted (correctly, as it turned out) that Maxwell was a crook, were taken as proof of defamatory intent.  Luvvies  Reader-submitted feature listing humorously pretentious quotations from actors and other theatrical celebrities. The term \\"luvvie\\" pre-dates the magazine as a derogatory noun for pretentious, overblown, narcissistic people of an artistic or dramatic bent. The column was briefly renamed Trevvies for several issues in the mid-1990s after Trevor Nunn described use of the term as offensive ‚Äúas calling a black man a ‚Äònigger‚Äô‚Äù.Sir Trevor Nunn brings Gone with the Wind to the West End The Times, April 13, 2008  The Neophiliacs  Examples of journalists employing the clich√© \\"x is the new y\\", e.g. \\"Black is the new brown\\" or \\"Basel is the new St Tropez\\". Even after a recent trend for certain journalists to preface their remarks with \\"At the risk of appearing in Private Eye...\\", remarks of this kind have not prevented many such journalists from receiving entries in the column, and Ian Hislop, editor of the Eye, was quoted himself in one issue.  Newspaper misprints  Quoting amusing misprints from newspapers or unintentionally funny examples of journalism, this section appears throughout the magazine. These often feature misprinted TV guides, such as a programme called \\"It Came from Outer Space\\" being illustrated by a picture of David Cameron speaking in the House of Commons. Frequent inclusion in this section gave The Guardian a reputation for common typographical errors, earning it the nickname The Grauniad.

It was renamed \\"Pedantry Corner\\" in 2008 following a reader's suggestion.  Pseuds Corner  Listing pretentious, pseudo-intellectual quotations from the media. At various times different columnists have been frequent entrants, with varied reactions.

It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. There are three subspecies: *C. u. unirufa - northeastern Colombia and the extreme west of Venezuela *C. u. unibrunnea - most of Colombia, Ecuador, and the extreme north of Peru *C. u. chakei - the Perij√° Mountains on the border of Colombia and Venezuela Description The rufous wren has a length of about . Birds in most of Colombia and in Ecuador are a uniform dark chestnut-brown colour with slight blackish barring on the wings and tail, though this is difficult to observe in the field. The lores are also blackish. Individuals in northeastern Colombia and in Venezuela are a slightly paler shade, especially on the crown. The rufous wren could be confused with the sepia-brown wren (Cinnycerthia olivascens), but that species is less rufous and has bolder barring on wings and tail. Another similar bird is the rufous spinetail (Synallaxis unirufa), but that species has a longer tail, has no barring on wings and tail and is altogether different in voice and habits. Distribution and habitat The rufous wren is found in montane areas of northern Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and southwestern Venezuela at altitudes usually between . It occurs in dense undergrowth in tropical moist forests. Behaviour The rufous wren is usually found in groups of a few individuals often joining other species of birds in small flocks. It flits about in the undergrowth and is often to be seen in and around clumps of Chusquea mountain bamboo. It has a complex and musical song consisting of repeated notes, trills and short phrases, and often sung in duets with other birds. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of the rufous wren as being of \\"least concern\\". This is because it has a very wide range and is said to be fairly common. It is possible that the population trend is downwards because of the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat, but it is thought not to be declining at such a rate as to justify putting it in a more threatened category.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The youth does not seem to have grown older at all in the three years that the poet has known him. Still, age comes on imperceptibly. If so, future ages will have to know that beauty died before future ages were born. This sonnet deals with the destructive force of time as we grow older. The poet uses his friend as an example. He admires the fact that his friend has kept his youthful appearance over the time that he has known him. Structure Sonnet 104 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 8th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. (104.8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The 13th line has a mid-line reversal (\\"hear this\\"): √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred: (104.13) This is a metrical variation that is more commonly encountered at the beginning of the line, and there is one definite (line 10) and several potential (lines 3, 4, 9, 11, and 14) examples of initial reversals in the sonnet. The meter demands a two-syllable pronunciation for \\"dial\\" in line 9.

The short-winged cisticola resembles the neddicky, a similar member of the genus Cisticola, but lacks the rufous crown with a shorter tail and clear buff underparts. Habitat It is widespread across sub-Saharan Africa, occurring from west Africa to Ethiopia south to the southern African part of Mozambique. Here it is locally common in clearings in woodland, especially miombo (Brachystegia) but also other types of savanna woodland. It also occupies thickets with termite mounds, vegetation along drainage lines and edges of cultivated areas. The nest is a compact ball shape with a side entrance, built of dry grass and leaves reinforced with spider web. It is typically placed very near the ground in a grass tuft or small shrub. Diet It mainly eats insects, foraging unobtrusively in grass tufts and on the ground. The following food items have been recorded in its diet: Insects such as: termites grasshoppers (Orthoptera) beetles (Coleoptera) bugs (Hemiptera) Breeding In Zimbabwe the egg-laying season is from November‚ÄìMarch.

History It was painted in Paris in 1937, and is one of the numerous portraits Picasso did of Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, his lover between 1927 and 1935, approximately, and the mother of his daughter Maya. In these portraits, Picasso carries out an exhaustive analytic exercise in which the youth and personality of Marie- Th√©r√®se are subjected to a thousand metamorphic transfigurations. The artist merges the frontal view of the face and the profile into a single image and turns the model into an icon of sensuality by means of a rich pictorial language in which the distorted forms marked the consolidation of the so- called 'Picasso style'. The portrait is at the same time epilogue to the confrontation between the two essential models of the moment, Marie-Th√©r√®se and Dora Maar. Despite the distorted forms, the diverging eyes and the angular features, this portrait is easily identifiable, because, like the ones he did at the same time of Nusch, Paul √âluard's second wife, and of Dora Maar, it preserves the sitter's essential features.Picasso : de la caricatura a les metamorfosis d'estil.

With an acceptance rate of 3%, The Dyson School is the most selective program in the Cornell University system. The Dyson School houses Cornell's undergraduate business school as well as graduate education in applied economics. The school focuses on business, agribusiness, environmental and resource economics, and international and development economics offering a Bachelor of Science in Applied Economics and Management and three graduate degrees, M.S., M.P.S. and Ph.D, in Applied Economics and Management. As of 2017, the Dyson School has 64 full-time faculty and 17 lecturers or adjunct faculty. In 2015, there were 104 graduate students and 735 undergraduates in Dyson School. Of these 735 undergraduates, 39% are female students and 11% international students. The program was originally named the Department of Agricultural Economics, then renamed Applied Economics and Management in 2002, and most recently, renamed in 2010 in honor of Charles H. Dyson following a US $25 million donation by his family, including his son, John S. Dyson, '65. The program offers students the opportunity to venture into one of 11 distinct concentrations from Accounting to Strategy and these serve to enrich the educational experience of undergraduate and graduate students alike.  Academics  The Dyson School is primarily housed in Warren Hall. The department offers one undergraduate major, Applied Economics and Management, which is an AACSB accredited undergraduate business program. Dyson earned a 6th-place ranking in Poets & Quants Best Undergraduate Business Programs of 2016. In fact, U.S. News & World Report ranked Dyson's business program #7 in its 2018 rankings of top undergraduate business programs.Applied Economics & Management/Cornell In addition, BusinessWeek's 2014 \\"Best Undergraduate Business Schools\\" rankings placed Cornell as the third best program in the country (a ranking it has held for 3 years). Historically, the program has undergone a series of developments regarding the focus of its studies. Originally conceived as an agriculturally- centered program, it has developed over the years to focus on both resource economics, applied economics, international and development economics, as well as general management. Undergraduate students may choose one of eleven specializations: Accounting, Agribusiness Management, Applied Economics, Business Analytics, Entrepreneurship, Environment, Energy, and Resource Economics, Finance, Food Industry Management, International Trade and Development, Marketing, and Strategy. Also, The graduate field of Applied Economics and Management (AEM) in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management offers 3 degrees: the research-based doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree, master of science (MS) degree, and master of professional studies (MPS) degree. Graduate students may choose from four subject areas: Environmental, Energy, and Resource Economics; Food and Agricultural Economics; International and Development Economics; and Management. In the Fall of 2015, the school had 92 incoming freshmen, and approximately 110 transfer students, 45 external transfers and 75 Intra- Cornell transfers. The admittance rate in Fall of 2018 for freshmen, being one of the most selective at Cornell University, was 2.9%.  Finances  The program is endowed by a $25 million gift from the Dyson family. It also receives annual state appropriations through the SUNY budget. As is the case with all students in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, in-state students pay a lower tuition than do out-of-state students.

The station airs a classic rock radio format and is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc. Its studios and offices are located at the Five Star Bank Plaza building in downtown Rochester. The station features one of the longest running morning comedy shows in the region, hosted by Brother Wease. WAIO has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts, the maximum for this part of the U.S. The transmitter is on Baker Road in Victor, New York, amid the towers for other FM radio stations in the area.Radio-Locator.com/WAIO WAIO broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 subchannel carries a wide- ranging rock format known as \\"Deep Tracks.\\" History :This article describes the history of the 95.1 frequency in the Rochester area. For the history of stations broadcasting from the Honeoye Falls site prior to 2004, see WNBL (FM).  Rural Radio Network/Ivy Network/CBN (1948-1981) The station now known as WAIO signed on June 6, 1948 as WVBT, licensed to Bristol Center, New York and transmitting from Bristol Mountain on 101.9 MHz. It was the next-to-last link in the Rural Radio Network chain of FM stations broadcasting to farmers across upstate New York. WVBT changed call letters to WRRE and changed frequency to 95.1 in the early 1950s. When the Rural Radio Network became the Ivy Network under new owners in 1960, WRRE became WMIV. It would retain those calls under the network's next identity, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), broadcasting religious programming from studios in Ithaca between 1968 and 1981.  WYLF/WZSH (1981-1991) With the breakup of the CBN radio operation, each of the former Rural Radio Network stations was sold to separate owners. WMIV was sold to Empire Broadcasting. In early 1982, it changed format to adult standards, becoming one of the first FM affiliates of Al Ham's Music of Your Life syndicated format. On March 4, 1982, WMIV changed calls to WYLF (\\"Life 95.1\\"), operating from studios in a converted house on Route 332 in Farmington, New York and later adding a sales office at 213 E. Commercial Street in East Rochester. In 1985, Empire sold WYLF to Boston broadcasters Ron Frizzell and Arnold Lerner, operating as the \\"Finger Lakes Wireless Talking Machine Company.\\" On July 28, 1986, WYLF became WZSH (\\"Wish 95\\"), moving from adult standards to soft adult contemporary with a format that mimicked Lerner's successful WSSH in the Boston market. WZSH moved its studios from Farmington to the Piano Works office complex in East Rochester and placed a translator, W288AR at 105.5 MHz, on the air from the East Rochester water tower.  Rock-It 95 (1991-1995)  On December 25, 1991, WZSH became WRQI (\\"Rock-It 95\\"), programming a rock format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-01-03.pdf In 1993, Rock-It 95 added the syndicated Howard Stern show to its lineup, bringing the station attention and ratings in the larger Rochester market. During the WRQI era, the 105.5 translator in East Rochester was replaced with a more powerful 250-watt translator, W238AB at 95.5, operating from the centrally-located Pinnacle Hill transmitter site overlooking downtown Rochester. WRQI made several attempts to improve its main signal on 95.1 as well, briefly moving from its historic Bristol Mountain site to a tower in Farmington owned by Rochester Telephone, but was forced to return to Bristol after interference complaints from the tower's neighbors.  The Nerve: Beginning Years (1995-1998)  On April 1, 1995, after an 11-hour stunt of a loop of \\"The End\\" by The Doors, WRQI became WNVE (\\"The Nerve\\").http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-04-07.pdf Playing off the frequency similarity between the main 95.1 signal and the powerful 95.5 translator, the station frequently identified as \\"95.1, 95.5 the Nerve,\\" usually spoken quickly by an announcer (an amusing promo bump was recorded featuring Howard Stern producer Gary Dell'Abate, where Gary expresses confusion at the dual-frequencies. \\"95.1/95.5...? Wait, that's two different stations!\\"). There was also a bump identifying the translator station ID W238AB that was played occasionally, spoken as quickly as possible. The Nerve's format was originally Modern Rock, featuring music being played by well-known bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Live, Stone Temple Pilots, as well as alternative music from lesser-remembered artists such as Poe, Veruca Salt, The Refreshments, The Toadies, and many others. Howard Stern was broadcast on weekday mornings. Weekday evenings at 5 PM consisted of \\"The Drive at Five\\" which was an all-request, call-in hour. This segment was usually introduced by DJ 'E-Man' with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's \\"Right Place Wrong Time\\" playing. There would also be a segment called \\"The Five at Nine\\", where the five most requested songs of the day would be played. Early mainstays at number one on this list were Poe's \\"Angry Johnny,\\" The Toadies' \\"Possum Kingdom,\\" Tracy Bonham's \\"Mother Mother,\\" and others. In the fall of 1996, a shortly-lived segment was introduced where the DJ would play two very new songs, usually by relatively unknown artists, back to back. The listeners would then call in and vote on which of the two would be allowed to remain in rotation. The winner would then move on to the next night, although it would already be allowed to remain in rotation even if it lost a later round. An early streak winner on this segment was The Bloodhound Gang's \\"Fire Water Burn,\\" long before it worked its way into the Five at Nine. The Nerve would also frequently give out tickets to local concerts featuring artists that were played on the station. Listeners would have to listen for Rage Against the Machine's \\"Take the Power Back\\" accompanied by a strange voice instructing them to call in to win. The modern rock format lasted until New Year's Day 1999, when The Nerve made their \\"Resolution to Rock.\\" This essentially meant that Classic Rock songs were now entered into rotation. This was a very controversial move because the station formerly aired imaging that would make fun of 'Dinosaur Rock' (with liners saying that 'in the Dinosaur age people used to listen to suck rock like Loverboy and Styx'), and listeners were now disenfranchised to hear these and similar bands now being played. It was at this point that WNVE lost a large portion of its listener base. Meanwhile, WNVE had moved studios and changed owners. In 1996, it was sold to Jacor Communications (later absorbed by Clear Channel Communications, now known as iHeartMedia), which relocated the studios from East Rochester to the Euclid Building in Midtown Plaza in downtown Rochester, home to its cluster of stations that also included WHAM and WVOR. The Nerve later would add brief local news reports during station breaks, usually as bumpers around breaks in the morning broadcast of Howard Stern. These news reports were often delivered by Bill Lowe from WHAM, the prominent news and talk AM station. Some degree of humor was derived by hearing the serious baritone voice of Bill Lowe give the station's sign off, \\"95.1/95.5 The Nerve, 'It Just Rocks.'\\" Of note, radio personality \\"JoLo\\" would host the Saturday Morning Show with e-Man. This was, of course, Joe Lomonaco, host of WHAM's popular \\"WHAM 5:00 News Hour.\\" For an April Fool's Day joke in the late 1990s, WHAM and WNVE swapped DJs for a few shifts. Mid-day WHAM talkshow host Bob Lonsberry came over to The Nerve and swapped shifts with e-Man, who went over to the newstalk station, much to the amused chagrin of local listeners.  The Fox (2004-2012)  Image:Wfxf.gif In February 2004, Howard Stern was dropped from WNVE and other Clear Channel sister stations across the country due to indecency complaints. Stern later struck a deal with Infinity Broadcasting to be carried in nine new cities (including four new stations in markets where Clear Channel dropped his show); Infinity-owned WZNE would pick up Stern that July 19.http://wxxinews.org/post/howard-stern-will-be-back-rochester- airwaveshttp://cbsradio.com/press/the-howard-stern-show-launches-on-nine- infinity-broadcasting-radio-stations-beginning-on-monday-july-19/ Without its main ratings draw in the morning, WNVE's ratings fell precipitously. On July 4, 2004, Clear Channel moved WNVE from 95.1 to the lesser Bristol Mountain 107.3 signal. Replacing it on 95.1 was the former 107.3 classic rock format, \\"The Fox,\\" with new calls WFXF. While most airshifts were initially automated, \\"95.1 the Fox\\" gradually added air personalities, including a voicetracked afternoon shift from Clear Channel Boston DJ Ed McMann. In 2006, WFXF began broadcasting in HD Radio, adding a subchannel of \\"Deep Rock\\" classic rock from the Format Lab. On November 17, 2008, WFXF began airing the popular radio program hosted by Brother Wease, one of the city's most popular veteran radio personalities who had previously hosted the morning show at crosstown competitor WCMF. Also in 2008, WFXF became a Rochester affiliate (along with sister station WHAM) of the Buffalo Bills regional radio network. The Brew (2012-2014) On April 30, 2012, WFXF rebranded as \\"95.1 The Brew\\", with the intent of shifting its playlist to 1970s thru 1980s, and even early 1990s rock, dropping most of the 1960s from its rotation. Wease remained with the station.http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S2601318.shtml?cat=566 On May 10, 2012 the station also changed its call sign to WQBW, previously used by Clear Channel in Milwaukee on what is now WRNW. Radio 95.1 (2014-present) On September 11, 2014 WQBW rebranded as \\"Radio 95.1\\".Clear Channel Launches Radio 95.1 The station made a massive DJ change bringing in Kimberly and Beck, who were recently at WBZA, to host from 2pm to 7pm weekdays after Brother Wease in the morning. These changes were on top of other changes made by Clear Channel to other stations it owned in the Rochester market the same day. The call letters were changed to WAIO on September 19, 2014. On August 6, 2020, following Kimberly and Beck's earlier dismissal for making racist comments on the air, WAIO debuted \\"The Big Show\\" in the same time slot, featuring comedian Earl David Reed along with former iHeartMedia DJ's Megan Carter and Pat McMahon.Radio show replacing 'Kimberly & Beck' launches References External links * *FCC History Cards for WAIO AIO Category:Classic rock radio stations in the United States Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WAIO"},{"id":"12444273","text":"Colonel Francis Cecil Ricardo, CVO, CBE (3 July 1852 - 17 June 1924) was a British Army officer, police officer, and philanthropist. Ricardo was born at Bramley Park at Guildford in Surrey, the son of Percy Ricardo (1820‚Äì1892) and his wife, Matilda Mawdesley Hensley (1826‚Äì1880), the daughter of John Isaac Hensley of Holborn in Middlesex. He was the brother of both Colonel Horace Ricardo (1850‚Äì1935) and of Amy Gordon-Lennox, Countess of March (1847‚Äì1879). He was educated at Eton College and followed his older brother, Horace, into the Grenadier Guards in 1872. He was promoted to captain on 8 June 1884, to major on 10 December 1890, and to lieutenant-colonel on 10 February 1897. In January 1900, he received a staff appointment as an assistant adjutant-general for the Home District, with the temporary rank of colonel whilst so employed. He was later aide-de-camp to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and retired from the Army in 1909. In 1899 he became honorary secretary of the Naval and Military Tournament and held the post until 1910, when he resigned following a disagreement with the Army Council over some of the content. During the First World War he served as acting chief constable of Berkshire County Constabulary. While serving in the Home District, he was involved with organising troops during the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902. For this service, Ricardo (who was a already a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO)) was invested as Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by King Edward VII two days after the ceremony, on 11 August 1902. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his police work in the 1920 civilian war honours. He served as High Sheriff of Berkshire twice, in 1894 and 1913. He was a great philanthropist and set up a reading in room in the village of Cookham in 1911, by purchasing the old Wesleyan Chapel, when a new larger one was built. He named it the King's Hall after George V. On his death in 1924, he left a legacy of ¬£814 2s 0d to pay for the maintenance of the Hall. In 1963, the hall was taken over by the Stanley Spencer Gallery. Ricardo was said to have been Kenneth Grahame's inspiration for Toad of Toad Hall in Wind in the Willows, as he drove round the village in a yellow Rolls-Royce and would offer lifts to any residents he saw. He collapsed and died suddenly while walking with his niece in the garden of his house, Lullebrook Manor on Odney Island at Cookham in Berkshire.

It is a common to abundant species in open savanna and scrubland habitats, whether in arid, moist or upland regions. Especially during summer, it is highly conspicuous due to its strident and repetitive call-notes from prominent perches. Range It is found in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Habitat Its natural habitat is arid, mesic or moist savannas and woodland, often dominated by thorn trees or thorn shrub (Dichrostachys, etc.). It is however also commonly found in miombo and mopane woodland, and is one of the commonest bird species on the Mozambican coastal plain. It is also present in the Eastern Highlands and the East African uplands below 2,000 m. In addition it utilizes some ecotones including edges of cultivation, fringes of dense woodland and woodland fringing the Okavango delta. Tinkling cisticola replaces it in stunted broad-leaved woodland and dry deciduous woodland on sandy substrates, while various Cisticola species replace it in marshy situations. It co-occurs with various Prinia species. Habits Especially in summer, much time is spent calling prominently from the top of a tree or bush. The strident call can be rendered as \\"chee-chee chichi-chirrrrr\\", but varies somewhat from individual to individual. Nesting Series of eggs, showing variation in background colour and spotting Breeding occurs during the wet season in spring and summer. They build a ball-shaped nest of very coarse grass blades, which is lined on the inside with fine plant material. Subspecies C. c. campestris in the Kruger National Park.

The name commemorates the French ornithologist Jean Dorst. Another very similar cisticola had been described some years earlier as a subspecies of the red-pate cisticola (C. ruficeps), and named C. r. guinea.

Thus, the newly discovered population is usually considered a good species, and the current scientific name is Cisticola guinea, although other taxonomists continue to use dorsti.

Horses that can perform these tasks are called \\"reined cow horses,\\" \\"cow horses,\\" \\"stock horses,\\" or \\"working cow horses.\\" Competition consists of three parts where a horse and rider are judged on their performance in a reining pattern, herd work, and \\"fence work\\". Horses are judged on accuracy, timing, and responsiveness, as well as how they handle a single cow and their ability to ride into a herd of cattle and quietly \\"cut\\" a cow from the herd. History The modern horse was reintroduced to the Americas by the Spanish conquistadors. By the time the Spanish missionaries were making their way into California in the 18th century, the Spanish vaqueros (cowboys) were well established in other parts of America and came with them. The King of Spain granted large tracts of land to loyal subjects, which were the basis for the \\"Californio\\" ranches and lifestyle common until the mid-19th century (and whose eventual owners were the source of the names of many California communities, including Irvine and Pacheco). These vast ranches raised range-bred beef for Mexican and other markets. The cattle were half-wild and dangerous, requiring a fast, well- trained horse that could intimidate an individual cow, turn it back from the herd, separate it for branding and other handling, and do it all effortlessly. Over time, the \\"Californio\\" cowboy or vaquero developed a system of training working cow horses that became famous for its elegance, precision, and difficulty of training the horse. The roots of these methods are in European dressage, a system to train horses for war. Adopted by the pre-Moors and Moors in Spain, and transferred to the Spanish conquistadors, the Californio methods created horses so sensitive to their riders' signals they were known as \\"Hair- trigger\\" or \\"whisper\\" reined horses.See Ed Connell website Hackamore Reinsman At the time, a finished reining horse (as it was called) required at least seven years to train: three to four years to train the basics in a bosal hackamore, then at least a year carrying both the bosal and the high-ported spade bit (named for the spade-shaped port which was from 1-3\\" high) to help the horse learn how to carry the bit, then several years refining techniques in the spade until the horse was a \\"made\\" reining horse. The training could not be done by just any Californio, and reining horses were valuable because of the difficulty of training and scarcity. A finished reining horse could be controlled and directed with minute movements of the fingers of the left hand, which hovered above the saddle horn. (Compare to the grazing-bit style of Western riding developed in Texas, where reins are split between the fingers and the hand moves in front of the saddle, controlling the horse by neck reining.) Because of the potential severity of the spade bit, chains added to the ends of the reins to balance the bit in the horse's mouth, and knotted and braided rawhide reins which prevented the reins from swinging unnecessarily, even at a lope, the \\"made\\" reining horse seemed to run, stop, spin and handle a cow on its own, with little communication from its rider. In the early-to- mid-19th century, the Gold Rush changed the complexion and future of California. The influx of newcomers into the Golden State helped to dissolve the vast cattle ranches of earlier days. On the ranches that did remain, modern livestock management techniques and machinery eventually eliminated much of the need for a well-trained, versatile working horse. By the early 20th century, the reined cow horse had gone from being a necessity to a luxury, and there was little activity to sustain the history or background of this training tradition. Most ranchers were struggling to survive the Great Depression. This trend continued through World War II; few people had the time to be concerned with the history, the horses and the training programs of \\"the old days.\\" Only a handful of horsemen who remembered the old Californios or worked with them on the remaining California ranchos learned the old ways of training a \\"made\\" reining horse. Among those who maintained the tradition in its purest sense is Ed Connell, author of the definitive spade-bit reining horse training manuals Hackamore Reinsman and Reinsman of the West. Trained in the 1940s by some of the last of the original Californio reinsman, Connell recorded this knowledge that provide an overview of the methods of training a \\"made\\" spade-bit horse resembling the famous horses of the past.

One session consists of reining work, where a reining pattern is performed.National Reined Cow Horse Association Rules 19.2 Judging Reined Work accessed on October 31, 2007 This is often referred to as the \\"dry work.\\"Strickland Competing in Western Shows & Events p. 71-73 The other is the cow work, where a single cow is released into the arena and the horse is asked to first hold the cow at one end of the arena (known as \\"boxing\\") then run the horse along the rail of the arena, turning it back without the aid of the fence (known as \\"fencing\\"). Lastly, the horse maneuvers the cow into the center of the arena and cause the cow to circle in a tight circle in each direction (known as \\"circling\\"). All this must be accomplished before the cow is exhausted. In three event competition, a \\"Herd Work\\" session is also included. The herd work is similar to cutting where a single cow is \\"cut\\" from a herd of cattle and prevented from returning to the herd by the intervention of the horse and rider. Herd work is most often included in three-year-old futurity and four- and five-year-old derby classes. Herd work is also included in a \\"Bridle Spectacular\\" class.National Reined Cow Horse Association Rules 19.3 Judging Cow Work accessed on October 31, 2007 (The Arabian Horse Association omits the reining work in its breed shows.) The horse is judged on the ability to control the cow, as well as speed, balance, responsiveness to the rider. A younger horse competing in a snaffle bit Today's reined cow horse competitors train horses at two levels, similar to the original Californio method. Younger horses, three-year-olds, can compete with a snaffle bit. Four- and five-year-old horses can compete in either a snaffle bit or bosal; six year and older horses compete in a \\"bridle\\", which utilizes a curb bit, usually a milder version of the original spade bits used by the Californios. Occasionally, one will see a skilled rider with a horse in a spade bit, but because of its potential severity, the difficulty and time involved in training a horse to a spade, and the well-bred horses of today which can perform without such bits, most horsemen avoid the spade.

IOR produces military and civilian grade optics and associated equipment for export and domestic production. The company is known in North America particularly for its rifle scopes (the LPS 4x6¬∞ TIP2), binoculars and other optics, which often accompany Romanian military equipment sold on the North-American market, such as the PSL rifle.  Presentation  The company was established in 1936 as a joint-venture between the Romanian industrialists Nicolae Malaxa and Max Auschnitt, engineer Petre Carp (Romania), with participation from the French companies Optique & Pr√©cision de Levallois and Bernard-Turnne. In 1941, when Romania entered the war alongside Germany, IOR was militarised and was tasked to produce mainly for the Romanian army. The first military scopes were produced at this moment for what was then the standard Romanian sniper rifle, the Vz. 24. After the war, though the production continued under Soviet domination, the company maintained links to famous Western European firms such as Carl Zeiss AG, Leica, Pentacon and Schneider Kreuznach, which assisted IOR in its modernization and expansion in the 1970s. As a consequence of Romania's refusal to join the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union ceased sharing technical information and exporting military equipment (including the newly designed SVD Dragunov). Accordingly, Romania designed the PSL rifle as a substitute for the SDV Dragunov, and IOR was tasked with developing a scope for the rifle as a replacement for the Russian PSO-1. The result was the LPS 4x6¬∞ TIP2 telescopic sight, which became the standard Romanian sniper rifle scope. The company is traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.  Products  Since its founding, IOR has produced military (including scopes, binoculars, range finders) and civilian grade optics (microscopes, medical lenses, glass lenses) and associated equipment (still cameras and camera lenses, cinema projectors, dental units). Since the 1980s, the company engaged in optical electronics, lasers, metrology, and thermal vision. The company is SR EN ISO 9001 certified. IOR optics are currently imported into the US by Valdada Optics and are marketed as \\"IOR Valdada\\". IOR's LPS 4x6¬∞ TIP2 scopes are commonly found on Eastern Bloc sniper rifles such as the Pu≈üca SemiautomatƒÉ cu LunetƒÉ, and SVD Dragunov. It is also a very common optic on the US commercial market on rifles that feature a compatible side rail mount. IOR was one of the Cold War era manufacturers that survived the transition to a non communist era rather well. This was due in no small part to their close associations with Western European manufacturers and their 1970s modernization. Other manufacturers like the Russian Novosibirsk Instrument Making Plant and Belorussian Zenit company have not been as successful in entering the Western market.  Rifle Scopes range  IOR is producing the following models of rifle scopes for the commercial market. The scopes are produced in batches and thus not all of them are always available on the market. Since early 2000s I.O.R. has started to produce very extravagant tactical scopes with technical solutions not often found by other brands. Among such innovations were: 35mm and 40mm main tubes to achieve greater elevation range, 6, 7, 8 and 10 times zoom factor and parallax adjustment in the form of a ring on a central tube. Glass used in their products is usually sourced from Schott.

He was the fifth son of Emperor Gaozong and the oldest son of his second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), and he was made the crown prince in 656. As he grew older, he often came in conflict with his ambitious and powerful mother Empress Wu, and it is commonly believed by traditional historians that she poisoned him to death in 675. His father Emperor Gaozong, then still reigning, posthumously honored him with an imperial title. Background Li Hong's mother Consort Wu had been a concubine of Emperor Taizong, and after Emperor Taizong's death in 649 she, like all of his surviving concubines who did not bear children, was sent to Ganye Temple (ÊÑüÊ•≠ÂØ∫) to be a Buddhist nun. However, in 650 or 651, when Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong visited Ganye Temple to offer incense, he saw her and remembered how he had been impressed by her beauty, and both of them wept. Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wang, who was sonless and had felt threatened by his favorite concubine Consort Xiao, who had given birth to a son (Li Sujie), found out about the situation, and decided to welcome Consort Wu back to the palace to be a concubine of Emperor Gaozong to divert his favors from Consort Xiao. Consort Wu soon became his favorite (so much so that Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, threatened by her, soon became allies against her), and she gave birth to Li Hong in 652. Li Hong was Emperor Gaozong's fifth son and her first son. In 653, he was made the Prince of Dai. In 655, Consort Wu falsely accused Empress Wang and her mother Lady Liu of using witchcraft and of murdering her daughter. Emperor Gaozong deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao and replaced Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were soon executed on Empress Wu's orders. Prior to this, in 652, Emperor Gaozong's oldest son (by his lowly-born concubine Consort Liu), Li Zhong, had been made the crown prince already, but Empress Wu had her ally, the official Xu Jingzong submit a petition arguing that now that the empress had her own sons, Li Zhong should step aside. Emperor Gaozong agreed, and in spring 656, Emperor Gaozong demoted Li Zhong to the title of Prince of Liang and made Li Hong the crown prince instead. As crown prince As Li Hong grew in age, he developed a reputation for studiousness and kindness. He had, at one point, studied the Zuo Zhuan under the official Guo Yu (ÈÉ≠Áëú), and when they reached the records dealing with how King Mu of Chu had killed his father King Cheng,See Zuo Zhuan, Rule of Duke Wen. (The Spring and Autumn Annals, of which the Zuo Zhuan was an edited version of, was a history of the State of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period, and King Mu's killing of King Cheng happened at the same time as the rule of Duke Wen of Lu.) Li Hong became distressed even reading about the incident, and after Guo pointed out that studying history was important so that history would not be repeated, he was still distressed, and so Guo advised him to study the Classic of Rites instead. In 661, formally by his orders, Xu Jingzong, Xu Yushi, Shangguan Yi, and Yang Sijian (Ê•äÊÄùÂÑâ) compiled a collection of particularly beautiful writing into a 500-volume work entitled the Yaoshan Yucai (Áë§Â±±ÁéâÂΩ©, literally \\"the Colors of Jade from Mount Yao\\") and presented it to Emperor Gaozong. Li Hong, as well as those officials, were rewarded with silk. Around the new year 669, after Tang forces commanded by Li Ji had conquered Goguryeo in 668, Li Hong, noting the harshness of Emperor Gaozong's prior edict that conscripted soldiers who deserted would be beheaded and their wives and children forced into servitude, submitted a petition, in which he pointed out that at times the alleged deserters were in fact innocent‚Äîthat they could have been ill, captured by Goguryeo forces without anyone realizing it, drowned while sailing on the way to the Goguryeo front, or been stuck behind Goguryeo lines. He requested that the penalty as to the alleged deserters' families be removed, and Emperor Gaozong agreed. In 671, perhaps due to Empress Wu's distaste for the capital Chang'an (due to her recurring dreams of Empress Wang and Consort Xiao taking vengeance on her), Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu left Chang'an and took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang, rarely returning to Chang'an from that point on. Li Hong was left in charge at Chang'an, although it was said that he was often ill, and the decisions were largely made by his staff members Dai Zhide, Zhang Wenguan, and Xiao Dezhao (Ëï≠Âæ∑Êò≠). However, several acts of kindness were attributed to Li Hong. Most notably, during a major famine in Guanzhong (the capital region), Li Hong, realizing that even his own guards were eating acorns and tree barks, distributed rice from the imperial storage, and distributing public lands at Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi) to the poor. Death and aftermaths One of Li Hong's kind acts, however, caused a deterioration of his relationship with his mother Empress Wu. Consort Xiao's daughters Princess Yiyang and Gao'an had, because of their mother, been put under house arrest inside the palace, so much so that they were not yet married even though they were over 39 years in age.The Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang both gave the princess' age as over 39, although the Zizhi Tongjian indicated that they were over 29. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 86 and New Book of Tang, vol. 81 with Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 202. Once, when Li Hong met them by chance, he took pity on them, and requested the Emperor Gaozong allow them to marry, and Emperor Gaozong agreed. In anger, Empress Wu immediately married them to two palace guards named Quan Yi (Ê¨äÊØÖ) and Wang Xu (ÁéãÂãó), and she became displeased at Li Hong. Empress Wu acted like a ruthless ruler during her husband's reign, having those who opposed her assassinated or executed at will. Empress Wu became so powerful that Li Hong and next, his brother Li Xian, began to be concerned. The relationship between mother and son further deteriorated over Li Hong's repeated suggestions to Empress Wu that she not be so controlling of the governmental affairs and asked her to hand over control of the government to him. At a later point, by order of Empress Wu Li Hong was no longer in command at Chang'an, and he went to Luoyang to join his parents. There, he married his wife Crown Princess Pei, the daughter of the general Pei Judao. In 675, Li Hong, while visiting Hebi Palace (ÂêàÁíßÂÆÆ), near Luoyang, with his parents, died suddenly. Most traditional historians believed that Empress Wu poisoned him to death. Emperor Gaozong was greatly saddened by his son's death, and he, in an unprecedented move, posthumously honored Li Hong the title of Emperor Xiaojing, and ordered that he be buried with honors due an emperor. (However, when an imperial tomb was to be built for Li Hong, it was said that the conscripted laborers were so displeased at the labor that they simply threw the construction material they had and deserted.) Li Hong was sonless. For a while, his nephew Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong), the son of his brother Li Dan (the later Emperor Ruizong), was posthumously adopted into his line. During the reign of his brother Emperor Zhongzong, he was worshipped at the imperial temple (with the temple name of Yizong), and his wife Crown Princess Pei was posthumously honored Empress Ai and worshipped there as well. However, after Emperor Zhongzong's death and succession by Emperor Ruizong, the chancellors Yao Yuanzhi and Song Jing pointed out that it was inappropriate for Li Hong, who did not actually take the throne, to be worshipped with emperors, and so he was given a separate temple at Luoyang and no longer referred to by the temple name of Yizong.

The series eventually culminates in the ball in which the fairy tale ends; but with its own unique twist. Plot Cinderella came from a noble family. She is the only daughter of a wealthy and widower duke who has remarried to provide her with a stepmother and two stepsisters. Cinderella's mother died due to illness when she was still a young girl, leaving her with a doll, favorite dress, and a pair of glass slippers. The story begins with the departure of the father of Cinderella for a long business trip. Unfortunately, she was then left alone with her stepmother and her two stepsisters, Catherine and Jeanne, who are bitterly envious of her beauty. Afterwards, things change for Cinderella; she ends up handling all the chores in the house, and is forced to live in a small room in the attic of the villa. Fortunately, Paulette, her Fairy godmother, watched over her, secretly removing troubles that Cinderella faced in various situations as well as giving her the gift of being able to communicate with animals. Cinderella soon befriended four little friends who aided her whenever possible; Patch, her dog, Chuchu and Bingo, two clever little mice and a little bird named Pappy. During one of the few occasions when Cinderella is able to go into town (she is virtually segregated at home to cope with household chores, while her two stepsisters are out having fun), she meets a strange young man who only identifies himself to have a connection with the prince of Emerald Castle. Cinderella initially does not trust him and calls him a fibber repeatedly. However, Cinderella does not know this guy is none other than Prince Charles himself, who, unwilling to stay at the castle to take lessons from his tutor, sometimes runs under the disguise of Alex, his page and great friend. This marks the beginning of many adventures, including hunting, discovering enchantments, betrayal and conspiracies of the palace that feature the Prince (almost always in disguise) Cinderella and her friends, and her stepmother (who hopes to marry one of her two daughters to prince Charles) but in the end, Cinderella discovers the true identity of the boy to whom she called a liar several times and is distraught and desperate; how will she make up for what she said to the prince? Meanwhile, the king is organizing a big royal ball, to which all the unmarried girls of the area are invited, so that his son Charles can find a woman to marry. The stepmother and the two stepsisters were angry that Cinderella was also invited. After Cinderella helped her two stepsisters and her stepmother get ready for the ball, she quickly changed her clothes, wearing her deceased mother's dress. Eventually, the step-mother insists it was an insult and forbid her to go. Then, her step-mother and her two step-sisters tore up her invitation. The Fairy Godmother, Paulette, always ready to help Cinderella with her magic wand gives her mother's beautiful gown a makeover and pairs the dress with the beautiful glass slippers; Cinderella can now go to the ball, but must return before midnight hour when the magic is completed. This time, Cinderella is to be incognito at the ball; prince Charles does not recognize that the beautiful princess who appeared out of nowhere was the companion of many adventures, but, come midnight, Cinderella is forced to flee, losing a shoe on the staircase of the building. The prince was fascinated by the mysterious princess, but deliberately hides away in his room to mourn the fact that she ran from him. Eventually his tutor and page Alex begin searching house to house to find her, as it was proclaimed that the person whose foot fit into the shoe would become the bride of the prince and thus, after many difficulties, Cinderella was proved to be that girl and was brought to the palace. On the day of the marriage, Duke Zaral had something else in mind, he gave poison to the prince in his drink and kidnapped Cinderella. He took her to top of the Clock Tower and forced the king, Charles' father, to give up his kingdom in lieu of Cinderella since his son was no more. Suddenly prince Charles, who did not really die, appeared with the palace guards. He explained that he had already known about Zaral's plan and acted accordingly. A fierce battle ensued between Zaral and the prince, at last Zaral fell from the Clock Tower. Cinderella and prince Charles were married and lived happily ever after.

He is the great nephew of Marcel Tolkowsky, the father of the modern round brilliant diamond cut. Family history In the 1800s Abraham Tolkowsky worked with precious stones. In the 1840s the Tolkowsky family moved to Antwerp. Abraham Tolkowsky's son Maurice established a good reputation in the business. Isadore and Sam now worked closely alongside their brother Maurice, and their father Abraham. Maurice invented the first diamond bruiting machine, which is fundamental to creating a perfectly round diamond. His brother Sam was elected the first chairman of the Antwerp Diamond Exchange. Career He was trained by Marcel and his father Jean, beginning in 1956, before becoming Managing Director and Chairman of Diatrada, N.V., a division of De Beers in the 1970s.Gabrielle Diamonds He invented the \\"flower cuts\\" in 1985‚Äì86, and since 1995, he has been a worldwide consultant to the De Beers group. Centenary Diamond In 1988, he was commissioned by them to act as master cutter for the Centenary Diamond, a task which took three years. This monumental diamond remained untouched for over a year while the correct tools and technical conditions were created by Gabi and his team. The gem was kerfed (hand cleaved) in order to avoid heat- or vibration-related damage from saws or lasers.\\"The Centenary\\", adiamondisforever.com Finally in 1991 the Tolkowsky's De Beers Centenary Diamond was finished weighing presents 247 facets and is acknowledged as the largest, most colour-perfect and flawless modern diamond cut in the world.

The Golden Jubilee is the largest faceted diamond in the world, weighing , more than the Cullinan I. The diamond was a rough stone. World-famous, it presents 148 facets, has a yellow-brown colour intensified by the brilliant cushion cut. The Golden Jubilee was chosen as a gift to the King of Thailand to celebrate his 50 years on the throne. Gabrielle Diamonds Drawing from techniques learned during the polishing of the Centenary and the Golden Jubilee diamonds, and from his experience with the \\"Flower Cuts\\", Gabi created the Gabrielle Diamonds, the world's first triple brilliant cut diamond. The Gabrielle Diamond in the Round shape consists of 105 facets, 48 facets more than the Classic Round Brilliant cut (with additional 8 crown facets and 40 pavilion facets). The Gabrielle Diamond was shown by a Light Study to exhibit 200% more scintillation than an excellent-cut classic brilliant diamond, and at the same time exhibited significantly greater brilliance and fire.Light Study done in the US This was achieved by increasing the path of light through the diamond, so that the diamond appeares to sparkle from all angles.

Set in early 20th century Austria-Hungary, the film tells a love story between the Gypsy girl Rada and the horse thief Zobar of Gorky's early 1892 short story \\"Makar Chudra\\" (). One of the songs near the introduction of the film had become popular on YouTube as the \\"Gypsy Song\\". It was the most attended movie in the Soviet Union in 1976, with 64.9 million tickets sold. Plot The film takes place in the beginning of the 20th century in a Gypsy camp on the Tisza river in the Zakarpattia region on the outskirts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Two young proud gypsies Loiko (Grigore Grigoriu) and Rada (Svetlana Toma) fall in love but believe that family life is a ball and chain that would fetter their independence. The first time Loiko meets Rada is when he becomes wounded and she finds him and heals him. Then the horse thief and the beauty meet again when Loiko accompanies Bucha (Borislav Brondukov) from Rada's Gypsy camp and comes into the camp itself, which is headed by old Nur (Mikhail Shishkov). Local middle-aged landowner-nobleman Antol Siladi (Ion Sandri Scurea) also falls in love with Rada whom he meets during his walks through the city, but she rejects him in full view of her camp and the unfortunate amorous gentleman curses the young Gypsy. The bold and lucky horse thief Loiko successfully steals a white mare as Rada wishes. However he incurs the wrath of the authorities who are preparing a raid in his encampment, and the proud and beautiful sister of Loiko ‚Äì Rusalina (Nelli Volshaninova) makes resistance attempts. Loiko's father finally gives his son over to the gendarmes, who sent his friend Talimon (Pavel Andrejchenko) shortly before that to the master Balint (Vasyl Symchych) for the purpose of debt collection. Unfortunately Balint says that Loiko promised to come to the estate as it was previously understood, and his servant stabs the Gypsy with forks in the stables. Meanwhile local authorities sentence Loiko to death but nevertheless Loiko manages to escape his penalty although he ends up losing his friend Bubulia (Sergiu Finiti) who comes to his aid. The horse thief catches up with Rada's Gypsy camp and presents the Gypsy mare to her. Rada has fun with Loiko on the river bank and then spends the night with him during which she offers him grape juice. At the end of the film Loiko, despite the gloomy predictions of the old Gypsy healer comes accompanied by his old friend Aralambi (Nikolai Volshaninov) into Rada's camp and asks his blacksmith friend Makar Choudhra (Barasbi Mulayev) to be his best man at the wedding [he thinks is going to happen]. Then, he walks up to Rada and has a dialogue where she doubts his mental strength by claiming he has tamed only tame horses so far. He admits (is unfazed) and holds a speech where he says that he would kneel in front of her and kiss her hand. Rada humiliates him however by whipping his legs so that he falls. Loiko stands up and demands her hand, instead of kneeling first. She demands that he fulfills his claim that he would get on his knees and kiss her hand. But he refuses to do so and demands her hand once again. And again she refuses, so he draws a knife and stabs her in the chest, killing her. The father of Rada ‚Äì the old soldier Danilo (Vsevolod Gavrilov) who was present at his daughter's murder, stabs Loiko in the back, killing him whilst Loiko holds Rada and panics after what he has done.

The organisation was officially affiliated to the FFF (French FA) in 1951. The Coupe d'AOF was created in 1947, when the president of the Ligue d'AOF, Mr. Barat, received a trophy from the FFF. He immediately announced a competition for the trophy, a Coupe du S√©n√©gal, for clubs from the \\"4 communes du S√©n√©gal\\", Dakar, Gor√©e, Rufisque and Saint-Louis.

Career Simmons was born in Tonbridge, Kent. After starting in second-half races at New Cross, he made his Provincial League debut at Hackney Hawks in 1963 aged seventeen but was unable to break into the Hackney team regularly so moved to the newly re- opened West Ham Hammers for the 1964 season.Rogers, Martin (1963) \\"Hackney Hawks Here to Stay?\\", Speedway Star, 1 June 1963, p. 16 In 1965 Simmons won a British League and British League Knockout Cup double with West Ham. In 1968 he moved to the King's Lynn Stars and stayed there for the next seven seasons. He was consistently at the top of the Stars averages and scored over 2112 points for the club. Simmons signed for the Poole Pirates in 1975 from King's Lynn. In his first season for Poole in 31 league matches he achieved 16 maximum scores (15 full and 1 paid) and he became the first Poole rider to secure a 10-point average in the British League. Simmons topped the Pirates averages for the next six years and he came to be affectionately known by the Poole fans as 'Super Simmo'. In 1979 the Pirates were taken over by new owners and Simmons became unsettled, asking for a transfer in 1980. At a pairs event at Poole that year, Simmons was accused by the Poole management of not trying and he was subsequently sacked by the club. He moved to Wimbledon in 1981, where he spent four seasons and moved to the Swindon Robins for one season in 1985. Simmons signed for former club Hackey, now renamed Hackney Kestrels, in 1986 for two years before he suffered a bad shoulder injury. He then made a couple of short come-backs at Arena Essex and King's Lynn. Malcolm captained England and Great Britain at full international level. He finished runner-up to Peter Collins in the 1976 Speedway World Championship, but became World Pairs Champion with John Louis the same year. He again became World Pairs Champion in 1977 with Peter Collins, and again in 1978 with Gordon Kennett. Simmons became British Champion in 1976.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002).

It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis. The golden white-eye was once considered to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a white-eye, its position within that family is still uncertain. The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands, where it is sympatric (shares its range) and competes with the related bridled white-eye. The golden white-eye has golden plumage and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit, and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The bird is monogamous and lays two eggs in a small cup nest. Fossil evidence shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through the impact of human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, and the fact that it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos. Taxonomy The species was once called the golden honeyeater as it was considered to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist √âmile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white-eyes. Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian white-eyes of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white-eyes. The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other white- eyes where that primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the white-eyes. Its generic name, Cleptornis, is derived from the Ancient Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and ornis, a bird. This is not a reference to any aspect of the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les √éles des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands. The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens. Distribution and habitat The golden white-eye is distributed on Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands. The golden white-eye is endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean, where it currently occurs on the islands of Saipan and Aguijan. Within its range, it occupies a variety of habitats, both natural and man-made. It is common in native forests, particularly limestone forests, but also occurs in open shrubland and suburban areas. On Saipan, the only habitats it is absent from are the marshes around Lake Susupe and grassy savannas. Description The golden white-eye differs from the other white- eyes in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (as it is in the other species). It is a large white-eye, 14 cm (5.5 in) long and weighing around 20 g (0.7 oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye- ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown- yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs. The golden white-eye makes a variety of calls. The song is a long raspy warble, rendered as \\"s√©√© m√©-can you s√©√© m√©-I can s√©√© y√≥√∫-can you s√©√© m√©\\". The species also makes rasping shorter calls and whistles when in flocks and in flight. Chicks give plaintive whistles when begging for food from adults. Behaviour Like other white-eyes, the golden white-eye is diurnal. In contrast to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of them in order to disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely. Diet and feeding A golden white-eye feeding on bananas The golden white-eye is a generalist, feeding on fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms part of the diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a pollinator of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range and that of the bridled white- eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest. Breeding Breeding occurs throughout the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9 m (between 1.5 and 6.5 m) off the ground in a variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink. The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 √ó 15.1 mm in size, which are pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are concentrated around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25 minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes. From laying it takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 10-14 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time. Threats and conservation Captive breeding is being attempted in some zoos to safeguard the future of this species. The range of the golden white-eye has contracted considerably since the arrival of humans in the Mariana Islands. Fossil bones of this species have been found on the nearby islands of Tinian and Rota, and it may once have occurred on Guam and other islands in the Marianas. At present the golden white-eye is very common, and in fact a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest recorded for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km¬≤ (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds. The species is nonetheless evaluated as critically endangered by the IUCN because the population is expected to undergo a rapid decline if the brown tree snake becomes established on Saipan. The primary threat to this species is the brown tree snake, a native of Australia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, which eliminated all 12 landbird species on nearby Guam after being accidentally introduced. The snake has not yet become established on Saipan, one of the two islands that compose the range of the golden white-eye, and which holds the largest population of the species. The isolation of Aguijan makes the introduction of brown tree snakes there unlikely, but the small population there is vulnerable as the island is only 718 ha (1774 acres) in size and a direct hit by a supertyphoon could wipe them out. Efforts are under way to breed the species in captivity and to prevent the snakes from being introduced and established on Saipan. Six zoos have recently received this species and breeding was expected to begin by 2011. Success came more quickly, and the first captive birds were bred in 2009 in the North Carolina Zoo. Birds from captive breeding will be introduced on new islands. In addition, 24 birds were translocated from Saipan to the island of Sarigan, a predator-free island reserve, in 2011 in the hope of establishing a breeding population.

It was published by TSR, Inc. in 1986 and is a compilation of seven previous related modules, often referred to as a \\"supermodule.\\" Together, the seven adventures form an integrated campaign that begins in the World of Greyhawk, continues underground into the Underdark, and concludes in the Demonweb Pits, the abyssal lair of the demonic goddess Lolth. The campaign was originally intended for use with the rules from the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The 152-page supermodule bears the code \\"GDQ1‚Äì7\\" for \\"Giants, Drow and Queen,\\" and can be further combined with two other campaigns to form an even larger campaign. The larger campaign begins with T1‚Äì4, The Temple of Elemental Evil, continues on to A1‚Äì4, Scourge of the Slave Lords, and concludes with GDQ1‚Äì7. Plot A new beginning was added to the adventure. Giants have been raiding civilized lands in increasing numbers. The player characters have been called upon to combat the giants and to investigate the giants' reasons for invading and the strength of their forces. The first module, Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, takes place in a gigantic wooden fort populated by hill giants and ogres. Here, the players uncover evidence of an alliance with other types of giants, as well as some mysterious letters from those behind the scenes. In the second module, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, the action moves north to colder lands, where the setting is a system of caves clustered around a deep and narrow chasm in glacial ice. Here, the protagonists encounter frost giants, yeti and winter wolves, among other monsters. The third module, Hall of the Fire Giant King, is set in a volcanic region where King Snurre has assembled a horde of fire giants, trolls and hell hounds. A secret passage from this module leads deep into the earth, where the adventurers discover the true nature of the force behind the raids ‚Äì the drow in the service of Lolth, the demoness. The fourth module, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, is on a larger scale than the others, with a map covering many kilometres of a deep underground region, later known as the Underdark. In the Underdark, there are many unique monsters previously unknown to surface adventurers, including the drow, which had been considered mythical. Troglodytes, jermlaine and svirfneblin (deep gnomes) made their first appearances in D&D; literature in this module. In the next module, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, the adventurers explore a subterranean complex populated by the Kuo-toa, a race of fish-frog monsters in the service of the lobster goddess Blibdoolpoolp. Players next make their way to the Vault of the Drow, a deep subterranean eldritch land in a huge cyst deep under the earth. The adventure is completed with Queen of the Demonweb Pits. It takes place primarily in the eponymous Demonweb Pits, the 66th level of the Abyss.  Publication history  The seven adventures described above were compiled in the GDQ1‚Äì7 supermodule. These included: * The three modules in the Against the Giants series: G1, Steading of the Hill Giant Chief; G2, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl; and G3, Hall of the Fire Giant King * The three modules in the \\"Drow\\" series: D1‚Äì2, Descent into the Depths of the Earth (which incorporates the earlier D1, Descent into the Depths of the Earth and D2, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa); and D3, Vault of the Drow * Module Q1, Queen of the Demonweb Pits All of the component modules were originally written by Gary Gygax, except for Queen of the Demonweb Pits, which was written by David C.

The species foraging strategy involves climbing the trunks of trees in search of invertebrate prey on and under bark. Although some populations within the species range have declined, the species IUCN conservation status is of Least Concern. Eulo, SW Queensland, Australia  Taxonomy and evolution  The White-browed Treecreeper (Climacteris affinis) is one of 7 species of Australo-Papuan endemic treecreepers (Family: Climacteridae). Prior to the development of molecular diagnostic techniques, the relationship of Climacteridae to other avian families was long debated. Phylogenetic analysis has since revealed the family to be most closely related to bowerbirds and catbirds (Family: Ptilonorhynchidae). Together these two families are thought to represent one of the most ancient linages of ‚Äòsongbirds‚Äô (oscines, suborder Passeri), diverging early during the rise and radiation of oscines in Australia. The further split between Climacteridae and Ptilonorhynchidae is estimated to have occurred 58.7-35.2 million years ago. Within Climacteridae, two genera are recognised Climacteris and Cormobates. Molecular analysis estimates the divergence between genera to have occurred during the Eocene-early-Miocene period. This estimate is further supported by the recovery of fossils referred to both genera within early Miocene deposits in Queensland, Australia. These ancient fossils all exhibit morphological features associated with scansorial (tree-trunk climbing), the primary mode of locomotion used during foraging by all extant species. The presence of these features suggest this foraging strategy to have evolved early within the family's evolutionary history. The genus name ‚ÄòClimacteris‚Äô is derived from the Greek term meaning ‚Äòthe rung of a ladder‚Äô, and refers to the groups tree- trunk climbing habits. The species name ‚Äòaffins‚Äô, Latin for 'allied', refers to the species resemblance to the Red-browed Treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops).  Subspecies  Two subspecies are recognised: * C. a. affinis Blyth, 1863 ‚Äì Australia, east of Spencer Gulf (rump uppertail coverts and tail grey) * C. a. superciliosus North, 1895 ‚Äì Australia, west of Spencer Gulf (rump, uppertail coverts and tail brown)  Description and field identification  The White-browed Treecreeper is 14‚Äì16 cm in length, has a wingspan of 22 cm and weighs 21gm. Adult male plumage is mostly dark grey above (crown, neck, rump and uppertail) excluding the mantle and scapulars of which are brown and black sub-terminal tail-band. Facial plumage includes black lores, white tapered eyebrow and black and white streaked ear-coverts. The chin is white and throat brownish grey. The upper breast is grey and lower breast, belly, flanks and vent streaked black and white. Undertail coverts are barred black and white. Females are similar to males but with rufous stripe bordering the upper edge of the eyebrow and dull white streaking, tinged rufous, on the centre of the upper breast. In both sexes the bill is black, around 1.5‚Äì2 cm long and is relatively straight and slender. The iris is dark brown and legs and feet black. Juveniles differ from adults with pale grey bill and both facial patterning and ear-covert streaking duller and less distinct. The White-browed Treecreeper has moderately long wedge shaped wings and square tail. Flight pattern over longer distances is undulated, involving brief bursts of flapping within long glides, during of which a buff wingbar is visible.  Similar species  The Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) is similar in appearance to the White-browed Treecreeper, however the Brown Treecreepers breast streaks are duller and ear covert streaking confined to rear coverts. In addition, Brown Treecreepers short shrill ‚Äòpeep‚Äô calls differ greatly to that of the White-browed Treecreepers long ‚Äòprrrpt‚Äô insect-like calls.  Distribution and habitat  White-browed Treecreepers inhabit arid and semi-arid regions across southern Australia, excluding Tasmania. The two subspecies ranges do not overlap, C. a. affinis found east of the Spencer Gulf and C. a. superciliosus to the west. White-browed Treecreepers inhabit a range of woodland and shrubland communities, dominated by either Acacia, Casuarina or Callitris species, with both dense and open understory's. White-browed Treecreepers are sedentary, pairs or groups actively defending relatively large territories (averaging 8.4 hectares in some regions) throughout the year.  Ecology   Feeding  White-browed Treecreeper climbing tree. Photo by Ron Knight The White-browed Treecreeper is a scansorial (tree-trunk climbing) bark-foraging specialist, feeding upon a range of invertebrates (predominantly ants) gathered from on and beneath the bark of tree trunks and branches. The climbing technique employed by the species is described as ‚Äòinching‚Äô by which the lower foot is lifted and brought to the level of the upper foot prior to the upper being moved higher.Orenstein, Ronald. (1977). Morphological Adaptations for Bark Foraging in Australian Treecreepers (Aves: Climacteridae) (PhD). University of Michigan. Such a technique differs from some other scansorial birds which lift their feet from the substrate simultaneously in a hopping or hitching fashion. Once White-browed Treecreepers reach the uppermost portions of a tree they glide down to a lower position on a nearby tree to recommence climbing. The species also frequently forages on the ground among logs and leaf litter. White-browed Treecreepers forage alone, in small family groups or during winter within mixed-species assemblages comprising other insectivores.  Feeding adaptations  White- browed Treecreepers exhibit a number of morphological traits, primarily of the legs, feet and toes, thought to represent scansorial bark-foraging adaptations. Such traits include increased toe length (increasing the span of the foot), long strongly curved claws (assisting the gripping of substrates), increased syndactyly of the front toes and reduced pads on the sole of the foot (reducing contact of the plantar surface of the foot to the substrate). Additionally, Climacteris species are able to move the hind toe independently to that of the front toes due to a lack of some ligament within the foot. This enables finer adjustments of footings to be made.  Breeding  White- browed Treecreepers breeding season varies across its range, commencing as early as July in the western parts of its range to August in the east, and continuing until November. White-browed treecreepers breed both as unassisted simple pairs or in cooperatively breeding units consisting of a breeding pair and 1-3 male offspring from previous years. Non-breeding male ‚Äòhelpers‚Äô provide assistance with all nesting related activities, other than incubation and brooding (conducted by the female alone). White-browed Treecreepers build shallow saucer-shaped nests within tree hollows, made of bark fibres, grass, twigs and branchlets and line the nest with feathers, fur, vegetable down and wool. The female lays a clutch of 1-3 pinkish-white eggs speckled reddish and purplish-brown, of which she incubates for 17‚Äì18 days. Nestlings take approximately 25‚Äì26 days to fledge upon which they remain dependent on their parents and associated ‚Äòhelpers‚Äô for food for up to 37 days. Although up to two broods may be raised per season White-browed Treecreepers have low productivity, with an average of only 1.58 young fledged per breeding unit annually. Threats Threats to the White-browed Treecreeper include habitat loss and fragmentation due to land clearing. Such threats have resulted in population declines and range contractions within some regions including Victoria, Australia, within which the species is now listed as Threatened under state legislation. The White-browed Treecreeper has also been recognised as a species highly exposed to the effects of climate change.  Conservation status  White-browed treecreepers are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. However, their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example: * The white-browed treecreeper is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria * On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the white-browed treecreeper is listed as vulnerable.

Bassom joined the Royal Marine Artillery as a gunner at the age of 17 and gained the highest possible marks in his gunnery examinations and therefore almost certain promotion. However, in 1886, just before he reached 21, the minimum age at which he could be promoted, he left to join the Metropolitan Police as a constable. He was posted to \\"D\\" Division (Marylebone), and the following year was transferred to the Public Carriage Office at Scotland Yard, where he spent the rest of his career. At the PCO his hard work, encyclopaedic memory and innate understanding of traffic problems led to rapid promotion. In 1901 he was promoted to chief inspector in charge of the branch. In 1903 he saw the introduction of London's first motor cab. After completing a course in motor engineering at the Regent Street Polytechnic, he produced the Metropolitan Police Regulations for the Construction and Licensing of Hackney (Motor) Carriages, 1906 (The Conditions of Fitness for Motor Hackney Carriages). This included the requirement for a turning circle, and influenced the design of London cabs for a century. In 1906 he was promoted to superintendent on merit. It was said that he could visualise any part of the 700 square miles of the Metropolitan Police District and give an analysis of its traffic problems and possible solutions. Commissioner Sir Nevil Macready admitted that Bassom was the one man in the Metropolitan Police who was indispensable, so much so that when he reached the retirement age of 60 for officers below Chief Officer rank in 1925 he was promoted to chief constable and given the title of Director of Traffic Services in order to retain him. He died the following year, still in office. He had a detailed knowledge of motor mechanics. He visited nearly every town in the United Kingdom and many in Europe to observe their traffic problems. He framed \\"the Knowledge\\", the test undertaken by all London taxi drivers, and devised the Bassom System of London bus route numbers. He was awarded the King's Police Medal (KPM) in 1919 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours.

It is endemic to Brazil. Males are blackish and females are mainly rufous. The stubby, hefty bill has a distinctively upcurved lower mandible and a straight culmen. Very little is known about this species. Its natural habitat appears to be denser sections of tropical moist lowland forest. It was formerly classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).BLI (2004) All suitable habitat has been cleared from the locality where it was discovered in 1986, and many feared it was extinct, until it was discovered at another site in south-eastern Amazonas in 2004. Following the initial rediscovery, it has been located at other sites in Amazonas and sites in Rond√¥nia and Mato Grosso. These sightings combined with an old record near Alta Floresta considered likely but unconfirmed indicate it is more widespread than previously believed. It was consequently suggested that downlisting it to Vulnerable status may be appropriate,BLI (2007) and this was done in 2008.BLI (2008) Footnotes References * BirdLife International (BLI) (2007): Rond√¥nia Bushbird (Clytoctantes atrogularis): downlist to Vulnerable?.

It is monotypic within the genus Clytomyias. It is found on New Guinea in its natural habitat of subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.  Taxonomy and systematics  First collected in the Arfak Mountains, the orange-crowned fairywren was described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1879.Rowley & Russell, p. 199. Molecular study indicates that it forms a clade with the fairywrens of the genus Malurus. Alternative names for the orange-crowned fairywren include orange-crowned wren, rufous fairywren, and rufous wren-warbler.  Subspecies  Two subspecies are recognised: * C. i. insignis - Sharpe, 1879: The nominate subspecies is found on the Bird's Head Peninsula in far north-western New Guinea * C. i. oorti - Rothschild & Hartert, 1907: Found in the central highlands of New Guinea from western New Guinea to the Owen Stanley Range of southeastern New GuineaRowley & Russell, p. 201.  Description  Unlike many other species of fairywren, there is no sexual dimorphism as the male and female have the same plumage. The head is a rusty orange colour, the thighs and tail rufous, the back olive brown and the wings brown. The bill is relatively broad compared with other fairywrens and is black in colour. The eyes are dark brown, and the legs pinkish brown. The two subspecies are distinguishable by their underparts, which are cream-white in C. i. insignis and more ochre-coloured in C.i. oorti.  Distribution and habitat  The orange-crowned fairywren is found in thick undergrowth of montane rainforest at an altitude of .  Behaviour and ecology  The orange-crowned fairywren is generally encountered in pairs or small groups of six to eight birds. Very little is known about its courtship behaviour or breeding.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theater of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task, she was awarded battle stars and citations during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Cacapon was launched 12 June 1943 at Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. A. V. Doherty; acquired by the Navy 21 September 1943; and commissioned the same day, Lieutenant Commander G. Eyth in command. The etymology is from a Native American word meaning \\"medicine waters\\". Cacapon River and Cacapon Mountain are in West Virginia.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  On 22 October 1943 Cacapon sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to load fuel at Aruba in the West Indies en route to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 12 November. On 30 November she rendezvoused with the U.S. 5th Fleet to deliver fuel at sea to the ships carrying out the Gilbert Islands operation. After a west coast overhaul, she returned to Pearl Harbor, from which she sailed 3 February 1944 to carry her vital logistic support to task force TF-50, then engaged in the Marshall Islands operation. She carried fuel on which all modern naval warfare depends to units of the U.S. 3rd Fleet from March into May, as the mighty task forces sent their strikes against Rabaul, Kavieng, Green, Emirau, and the Admiralties. During a part of this period, she served temporarily with the U.S. 7th Fleet's service support group for the New Guinea operation. Cacapon served as station tanker successively at Efate and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons; and Manus, Admiralty Islands, until 8 January, when she cleared Manus for Ulithi. Here she reported to the 3rd Fleet, and between 12 and 27 January her operations supported task force TF-38 during its series of strikes against Luzon and Formosa supporting the Philippine attacks and consolidation. Cacapon lengthened the list of operations to which she had given vital support as she steamed with the 5th Fleet during the Iwo Jima operation, from 15 to 26 February, and the Okinawa operation from 24 March to 30 June. Between these, she served briefly as station tanker in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands.  End-of-war activity  Cacapon brought her essential aid to the 3rd Fleet in its final devastating air attacks and bombardments on the Japanese home islands in July 1945, and on 20 September entered Tokyo Bay. Ten days later she cleared for San Pedro, California, arriving for overhaul 11 October. She returned to the Far East in December, providing support to occupation forces with a shuttle service between Yokohama, Japan, and Shanghai and Tsingtao, China.  Running aground in the Persian Gulf  In April 1946 she sailed to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf to load oil for delivery to Kwajalein Atoll, where her cargo was to be used during Operation Crossroads. However, on the first day at sea, 24 April, she ran on Shah Allum Shoal in the Persian Gulf. While the current pulled her clear, her engine and fire rooms began to flood and all power was lost. Aided by , , and , Cacapon put back to Bahrain for temporary repairs, and proceeded to San Pedro, California, for permanent repairs.  Supporting Antarctic operations  On 2 December 1946, Cacapon cleared San Pedro, California, for 10 weeks in the Antarctic in Operation Highjump. She called at Sydney, Australia, en route Long Beach, California, returning home 8 April 1947. Between 1947 and 1950 she cruised in the Pacific on two extended Far Eastern tours.  Korean War operations  Far Eastern operations continued to be the rule for Cacapon when war broke out in Korea in June 1950; she completed four lengthy tours of duty there during the three years of fighting. Sailing with the U.S. 7th Fleet and the Formosa Patrol Force, she carried fuel and supplies to these sea forces. On her first tour, during which she helped to support the amphibious landing at Inchon on 15 September 1950, she earned the Navy Unit Commendation for her high performance of duty. From the end of hostilities in Korea through 1960, Cacapon made six more Far Eastern tours, continuing to sail with the 7th Fleet and the Taiwan Patrol Force. In 1958 she served as the oiler replenishing the ships in Operation Hardtack, which conducted nuclear bomb tests in the lagoons of Bikini and Eniwetok, Marshall Islands.  Vietnam War operations  During her 1955 tour she took part in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands from 6 to 14 February, and the Vietnam evacuation \\"Operation Passage to Freedom\\" of 6 to 15 March. From February to August 1958, she joined in Operation Hardtack I at Bikini Atoll. The intervals between deployments have found her operating locally from Long Beach, California. The Cacapon was the site of the 1968 strangulation of Ensign Andrew Muns. He was murdered after uncovering a theft of $8,600 from the ship's safe by Michael LeBrun. The Navy initially branded Ensign Muns the thief and accused him of deserting with the stolen cash. At the insistence of the Muns' family, the case was reopened by NCIS in 1998 and a subsequent cold case investigation led to Michael LeBrun. After a lengthy interrogation, LeBrun confessed to the murder and to disposing of the body by throwing Ensign Muns into one of the oiler's massive fuel tanks. The body was never recovered. After thirty years marked as a dishonorable deserter, Ensign Muns was given an honorable ceremonial burial in Arlington National Cemetery.  Final decommissioning  She was decommissioned, and struck from the Navy List in August 1973 and transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal. Her final disposition was to be sold for scrapping (date unknown) to Zidell Exploration Portland, Oregon.  Awards  Cacapon received four battle stars for World War II service, and the Navy Unit Commendation and nine battle stars for Korean war service.

It was formerly placed in the bird-of-paradise family Paradisaeidae until genetic work proved it was unrelated to those birds. It is found in Papua New Guinea.  Etymology  The scientific name Cnemophilus sanguineus consists of cnemophilus, meaning \\"mountain/slope-lover\\" and sanguineus meaning \\"bloody\\", referring to the males' bright reddish-orange to orange upperparts.  Description  Male specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center The male red satinbird sports bright, orange to reddish-orange upperparts, tail and most of the head is of the same color as well. The cheeks, chin and everything below is a blackish to black color. The feature that granted their former name, sickle-crested bird- of-paradise, is the small group of fine, brownish-purple crest plumes that are usually obscure in the head/crown feathers and is usually raised during displays. The female is plain olive brownish above and light brownish below. Like other members of the family, they have weak feet and an extremely wide gape; the mouth is pinkish in color, and the bill is light grayish. They make harsh rasping calls and also some bell-like ringing sounds; some clicking and creaking calls have been recorded as well.  Behavior and ecology  Red satinbirds are usually seen solitarily, pairs or occasionally in small groups at good fruiting trees. Like all satinbirds, their diet is exclusively fruits, in which their wide gapes are accustomed to. They are also sometimes seen feeding in association with birds-of-paradise in good feeding sites. Outside of fruits, they have been recorded taking earthworms and shelled molluscs. Breeding season not well studied, but is known to occur in August through January in the Eastern Central highlands. The female takes sole duty of rearing the chicks and building nests; she builds dome-shaped, globular nests reminiscent to bowerbirds' nests, made out of twigs, stems, leaves, etc. The clutch is most likely one egg, and it takes around 25-27 days for them to hatch. The chicks are fed mainly fruits and some invertebrates.  Habitat and distribution  C. sanguineus is found in mountains of central and eastern New Guinea, i.e. Kaijende Highlands and Mt.

Each annual volume reprinted what in the opinion of the editor was the best fantasy literature short fiction appearing in the previous year. Carter's picks tended to be idiosyncratic, concentrating on long-established authors in the field and reflecting his own particular enthusiasms. He also habitually padded out the volumes he edited with his own works, whether written singly, in collaboration, or under pseudonyms. Saha‚Äôs editorial choices more closely reflected the contemporary field and highlighted more emerging authors.

It is a quiet and elusive bird species that has been considered to be related to the thrushes of family Turdidae or the related Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers). They are found in dark forested areas and is found in the canopy, where it often sits motionless. Description This bird appears dark in the shade of the forest and the colours become clear only when it is lit by the sun. The crown is silvery blue and a black mask runs over the eye. A grey carpal patch is present at the base of the black wing feathers and a wing patch is prominent. The tail is silvery blue with a black terminal band. The male has dull purplish grey secondaries and coverts and the body is greyish while the female has rufous replacing the purple. An artist's illustration of both male and female. The genus name is from the Nepali word for the bird and was used by Brian Houghton Hodgson. The family position of the cochoas has been unclear with some sources suggesting that they belong to the Muscicapidae while others have suggested them to be in the family Turdidae. The latter suggestion has found more support in recent molecular studies. Distribution and habitat It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. In India, it is found along the Himalayas with the western limit about 100 km west of Musoorie. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Behaviour and ecology The species is not very active and is found mainly in the canopy. The breeding season is May to July, when it builds a cup shaped nest in a fork. The nest is covered with moss, lichens and a white thread-like fungus which is said to be distinctive. Three pale sea-green eggs with some blotchy markings are laid and both sexes take turns in incubation. The birds are shy at the nest and slip away even when disturbances are afar. The song consists of is a low whistle while other calls include a sit and soft trrrs. These cochoas feed on berries, insects and molluscs. While picking fruits from trees they were observed behaving like flycatchers doing short sallies.

A female green cochoa; note the characteristic rufous tinge on the wing panels Distribution and habitat The green cochoa is found in Cambodia, China, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, and possibly Bhutan. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. They make seasonal movements that are not well understood. Their distribution in winter in India is unclear as the species is found only in summer. An old record from Uttaranchal (Nainital) is the westernmost record, and no recent records exist from Nepal. Most records are east of northwest Bengal. Behaviour and ecology Egg The green cochoa is usually seen in pairs or small groups sitting in tall trees. They usually feed close to the ground, on mollusks, insects and berries. They sometimes launch aerial sallies to capture insects. This species breeds in summer, and the nest is much like that of the purple cochoa, but is usually placed close to water. Both parents take turns incubating. The song is a thin and clear feeeee that dies away. Calls include a short high-pitched pok and harsh notes. The glossy eggs are ellipsoidal and densely speckled.

Allen & Co., 1838, p. 25 and is said to live either in the moon or in the \\"obscure regions\\" (Yue ming), the Chinese equivalent of Hades. Legend A legend is told about the old man under the moon. During the Tang dynasty, there was a young man named Wei Gu (ÈüãÂõ∫ W√©i G√π). Once he was passing the city of Songcheng, where he saw an old man leaning on his pack reading a book in the moonlight. Amazed, Wei Gu walked up and asked what he was doing. The old man answered: \\"I am reading a book of marriage listing for who is going to marry whom. In my pack are red cords for tying the feet of husband and wife.\\"Ning Huang, Roman Retzbach, Knut K√ºhlmann: China-Knigge: Chinakompetenz in Kultur und Business, Walter de Gruyter, 2015, p. 256 When Wei Gu and the old man came together to a marketplace, they saw a blind old woman carrying a three-year-old little girl in her arms. The old man said to Wei Gu: \\"This little girl will be your wife in the future.\\" Wei Gu thought this was too strange to believe and he ordered his servant to stab the girl with his knife. Fourteen years later, Wang Tai, the governor of Xiangzhou, gave Wei Gu his daughter in marriage. He was having difficulty finding a suitable match of higher standing for his daughter for even though she was a beautiful young woman, she had difficulty walking and had a large scar on the small of her back. When Wei Gu asked what had happened, he was told that she had been stabbed by a man in the marketplace fourteen years before. After ten years and three children later, Wei Gu sought the old man for suitable matches for his two younger sons and daughter. The old man refused to find suitors for his children. During the later years, Wei Gu sought to find a possible match for his children but by coincidence, no marriage was put to order. In fiction Yue-Laou (sic) appears as a character in Robert W. Chambers' short story \\"The Maker of Moons\\" from the collection of the same name in 1896. He is the leader of Kuen-Yuin, a sect of Chinese sorcerers, and is called \\"Maker of Moons.\\" He had corrupted \\"the Xin, the good genii of China\\" and transformed them into a monstrous composite being: \\"This monster is horrible, for it not only lives in its own body, but it has thousands of loathsome satellites‚Äîliving creatures without mouths, blind, that move when the Xin moves, like a mandarin and his escort.\\" In the story, it is revealed that he is the stepfather of Ysonde and is associated with the pack of gold makers. Although he is apparently killed, his body is never found. The moon immortal appears as a major character in the TV series Ashes of Love. He is in charge of love and marriage of all mortal beings through the use of his red threads. In Grace Lin's Where the Mountain Meets the Moon, a novel published in 2009, one of the main characters is named the Old Man of the Moon and seems to have a lot of inspiration derived from Yue Lao and the story of Wei Gu, related above.

A French edition was published in 1976 and an English version entitled The Farewell Party. This novel mostly deals with love, hate and accidents between eight characters who are drawn together in a small spa town in Czechoslovakia in early 1970s. Like most Kundera's work The Farewell Waltz is a book of many layers. On the surface it is a comedy or a burlesque. Still the comedy is just at the top of this story which involves much darker and ambiguous tones.Review at kundera.de Characters R≈Ø≈æena R≈Ø≈æena is a young and pretty nurse who has, allegedly, become pregnant from Kl√≠ma. Franti≈°ek Franti≈°ek is a guy with a motorbike who believes that R≈Ø≈æena is his girlfriend, and that he is the father of the child she is carrying. He desperately wants to marry her, even though he knows of her affair with Kl√≠ma. Kl√≠ma Kl√≠ma is a trumpeter from a big orchestra, a Don Juan who had a one-night stand with R≈Ø≈æena and completely forgot about her until she informed him that she would be having a baby. Kamila Kamila was formerly a popular songstress, Kamila had to end her career because of health problems. She is Kl√≠ma's wife and is extremely jealous of her husband and always suspects him of having affairs. ≈†kr√©ta ≈†kr√©ta is a gynecologist at the spa who wants to be adopted by Bertlef so he could become an American citizen, and who has an original method for helping couples that can't have babies Bertlef Bertlef is a rich American with poor health who has to spend most of his time in the spa town. Thanks to ≈†kr√©ta he and his wife were able to have a baby (it is presumed that this was a case of ≈†kr√©ta's sperm treatment). Jakub Jakub is a former political prisoner, who now has received a permission to leave Czechoslovakia. He is paying his last visit to his friend ≈†kr√©ta, who once gave him a pill of poison for committing suicide if he felt that all hope was lost. Olga Jakub's \\"ward\\" Olga is the daughter of a man who once betrayed Jakub. She believes (because Jakub has told her so) that her father was Jakub's best friend. Plot Day 1 The book is split up into five sections, each corresponding to a day. On the first day, Kl√≠ma the trumpeter receives a phone call from R≈Ø≈æena who claims that she is pregnant from the time Kl√≠ma and his band visited the spa she works at two months prior. Kl√≠ma decides to travel to the spa the next day to talk R≈Ø≈æena into having an abortion. Day 2 When he sees her the next day, he meets with Bertlef and ≈†kr√©ta and tells them of his plan, admitting that he wants to have an abortion because he loves his wife, the actress, so much. When he meets with R≈Ø≈æena, he tells her that he loves her and wants to go on a trip with her, but asks that she have an abortion because the love they have together shouldn't be hindered by a child just yet. R≈Ø≈æena, although suspicious seems to agree with this plan before the pair are followed and then harassed by Franti≈°ek, a local handyman in love with R≈Ø≈æena. Klima returns to the capital to appease his wife, but she knows that Klima has been unfaithful, and is saddened by his attempts to hide it. Jakub at the same time is visiting his friend Olga, the daughter of an old political rival who he cared for when her father was killed. He is leaving Czechoslovakia because of the political climate and has visited the spa to say goodbye. He reveals that Dr. ≈†kr√©ta once made a pill for him which would allow him to kill himself if ingested, as a way of being in control of his own fate if captured again. Day 3 Jakub waits to meet Olga the next morning at a Cafe where Klima and Ruzena are speaking. Klima is pleading to Ruzena, but she obstinately walks away, suggesting that she refuses to have an abortion. Jakub notices Ruzena has left a bottle on the table, filled with blue tablets. He's struck to find the tablets are almost identical to the one given to him by the doctor. In comparing them, he accidentally mixes the two up, and Ruzena returns to find him holding the bottle and grabs it from him before walking away. Jakub then wonders why he didn't do more to stop Ruzena, knowing that he was sentencing her to death by not taking the tablets from her. He goes to Skreta to see if he knows where Ruzena went. Dr. ≈†kr√©ta reveals to Jakub that his procedure for getting his patients pregnant, and why he is so successful, is that he injects his own semen into the mother using a syringe. He offers Jakub an opportunity to donate some of his semen for the doctor's scheme. Later that evening, Jakub is frightened by the number of children in the town who seem to unnaturally resemble ≈†kr√©ta: they all have large noses and some talk in a nasally voice. That night, Klima has a concert in the Spa: an agreement he had with Skreta so that he could get an abortion. His wife Kalima surprises him, and he's unable to speak with Ruzena for the rest of the night. A distressed Jakub notices Ruzena in the crowd and is relieved to see that she is still alive. He decides that she must have already taken the pill, but that Dr. Skreta had never given him a tablet of poison. Jakub decides that Skreta must have given him a harmless tablet as to appease his pleas, and that Ruzena would be all right after all. Ruzena goes to Bertlef and Bertlef confesses his love for her. The two sleep together and Ruzena is finally happy. Day 4 In the morning, Jakub leaves for the border and a distressed Kl√≠ma leaves his wife early on to find R≈Ø≈æena, only to be turned away by her. The two meet again at the abortion hearing, and R≈Ø≈æena agrees to an abortion but hints to Kl√≠ma that she might retract her decision at any moment. When she returns back to the spa, Franti≈°ek runs in yelling and tries to convince R≈Ø≈æena to keep the baby which he is convinced is his. The two argue, and R≈Ø≈æena pulls out the tube containing her medicine and ingests the poison tablet. She is killed instantly. A hysterical Franti≈°ek tries to get the police to arrest him when they arrive, claiming that he drove her to kill herself; however, the police are skeptical of any foul play and refuse. Dr. ≈†kr√©ta tells the investigators that Kl√≠ma showed up to the abortion hearing as an agreement. The child wasn't actually his, but he agreed to act as if it were in front of the committee so that they would approve of the abortion due to the marital complications a child might have on Kl√≠ma. Bertlef is horrified to hear of Ruzena's death, doesn't believe that she killed herself, claiming that she was happy the night before. He tells the investigators that someone must be accused because he believes suicide is the most despicable crime one can do. Without any other leads on who might have wanted Ruzena dead, the police jokingly accuse him of being the only other person with an agenda: Bertlef wanted to dispose of a nagging and manipulative Ruzena before his actual wife arrived the next day. Bertlef exclaims that he was indeed responsible for the death, but the police indicate that they know he did not kill her. Day 5 The next day, Kamila decides that she will leave Kl√≠ma, Jakub sadly reflects on his leaving his home, and Bertlef meets his wife and son at the train station only to notice the unusually large nose of his child.

They have nondescript, predominantly brown or grey, plumage, but are accomplished singers, their calls described as \\"strong, mellow and beautiful.\\" Shrikethrushes are generally insectivorous, though have been recorded eating molluscs and berries. They build cup-shaped nests in the forks of trees. Taxonomy and systematics Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the genus in 1827, coining the genus name from the Ancient Greek words collurio \\"shrike\\" and cinclos \\"thrush\\". Noting the beak, they thought it related to shrikes or vangas, though its form was reminiscent of thrushes. Shrikethrushes were commonly known as colluricinclas in the 19th century, but their current name was in use by the late 19th century. Molecular studies by Norman and colleagues in 2009 and J√∏nsson and colleagues in 2010 show the shrikethrushes to lie within the whistler family Pachycephalidae. Formerly, some authorities classified the shrikethrushes in their own family Colluricinclidae. Molecular dating suggests the shrikethrushes diverged from the common ancestor of the genus Pseudorectes (their closest relatives) in the mid-Pliocene around 3 million years ago, and that this combined lineage had diverged from the ancestor of the other members of the Pachycephalidae around 5 million years ago in the early Pliocene. The Sangihe shrikethrush was found to be more closely related to the maroon-backed whistler and hence shifted to the genus Coracornis. Genetic investigations of New Guinea populations of the little shrikethrush indicate high levels of genetic divergence, suggesting it may comprise more than one species.

Early life Se√°n Kenny was born in Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary in 1923. He was born into a family that had a strong association with the game of hurling. His uncle, Patrick Harty, captained the Tipperary team that won the All-Ireland junior title in 1930. Kenny was educated at the local national school and later attended Thurles CBS where his own hurling skills were developed. In 1939 he captained the school to both Dean Ryan (under-17) and Dr. Harty Cup (under-19) titles. Playing career Club Kenny played his club hurling with his local club in Borris-Ileigh and enjoyed much success. He was captain of the club team in 1949 as Borris- Ileigh defeated Kickham's to take their very first senior county championship. Kenny added a second county winners' medal to his collection in 1950 as Borris-Ileigh retained their title. He captured a third and final county title in 1953. Inter-county Kenny first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in 1941 when he captained the Tipperary minor hurling team in the Munster final. Cork, however, were the victors that day. Kenny's skill at club level was quickly noted and he soon made it onto the Tipperary senior hurling team. It was in his debut season that he enjoyed his first major success when Tipp defeated Limerick by 1-16 to 2-10, giving Kenny a Munster winners' medal. He subsequently lined out in his first ALl-Ireland final at senior level. Surprisingly, Laois were the opponents on that occasion, however, the result was expected. Tipp opened the floodgates with a Paddy Kenny goal before Jimmy Kennedy added two more goals in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Tipp were the victors by 3-11 to 0-3 and Kenny had captured an All-Ireland. In 1950 Kenny was captain of the team as he added a National Hurling League winners' medal to his collection before further provincial glory followed. A 2-17 to 3-11 defeat of Cork gave him a second consecutive Munster medal and an easy passage into another All-Ireland final. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion in a close but uninteresting game. At the final whistle Tipp emerged the victors by 1-9 to 1-8 giving Kenny a second All-Ireland medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 351 He also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of his county. In 1951 Kenny was captain of the team again, however, his intercounty activity was curtailed due to an injury he sustained in a provincial game against Waterford. He missed Tipp's third consecutive Munster final triumph, however, he came on as a substitute in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Nicky Rackard had been Wexford's star goal-poacher throughout the year, however, his artistry was beaten by Tony Reddin in the Tipperary goal-mouth in that game. S√©amus Bannon, Tim Ryan and Paddy Kenny got the goals in the second quarter that did the damage, however, Tipp forged ahead to win by 7-7 to 3-9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 351 It was Kenny's third consecutive All-Ireland medal. Kenny‚Äôs career at inter-county level ended shortly after that game as a chronic knee injury forced him to retire. Provincial Kenny also won two Railway Cup medals with Munster in 1949 and 1950 (as captain).

It claims that the Chinese government has the requisite influence to pressure the Sudanese government to accept international police into its country, although China disputes this. The methods of the campaign are alternative torch relays and boycotts intended to disrupt the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Goals  The Olympic Dream for Darfur is based in New York and headed by Hollywood actress and U.N. Goodwill Ambassador Mia Farrow. The organization was founded by Farrow, Sudan expert Eric Reeves, and campaign director Jill Savitt. The goals of the campaign and organization are the new deployment of an African Union and United Nations peace force, and the disarmament of Janjaweed militias. Olympic Dream for Darfur says that because China supplies oil and arms to Darfur and has extensive economic interests there, that China could influence the Sudanese government to accept an international police force to halt violence in Darfur. The Chinese government's position is that the Darfur problem is very important to China; that China is making real efforts to bring the Sudanese government and the international community together to resolve the issue; that drawing a connection between Darfur and China, and drawing a connection between Darfur and the Olympics, do not help to resolve the issue; and that the actions of the campaign are contrary to the Olympic spirit and a violation of the principle of non-politicisation of the Olympic Games.‰∏≠ÊñπÂØπÊñØÁöÆÂ∞î‰ºØÊ†ºÊîæÂºÉÂ••ËøêÈ°æÈóÆÂ£∞ÊòéË°®Á§∫ÈÅóÊÜæ (China expresses regret at statement by Spielberg renouncing consulting role for Olympics)  Methods  Olympic Dream for Darfur organizes torch relays to sway public opinion towards pressuring China to use its influence in the Darfur conflict.

He played hurling with his local club Holycross-Ballycahill and was a member of the Tipperary senior inter-county team from 1947 until 1957. Stakelum captained Tipperary to the All-Ireland title in 1949. Playing career Club Pat Stakelum played his club hurling with his local Holycross-Ballycahill club and enjoyed much success. Although not regarded as one of the most successful clubs in the county he won three senior county titles in 1948 (the club's first county championship title), 1951 and 1954. Inter-county Pat Stakelum first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the early 1940s as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team. He won a Munster medal in this grade in 1945 before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. A high- scoring game followed, however, Dublin were the winners by 3-14 to 4-6. Pat Stakelum's skills were quickly noted and he soon joined the Tipperary senior hurling team. He made his debut in 1947, however, Tipp were going through a barren spell. All this changed during the 1948-49 National Hurling League. It was that year that Stakelum, captain of the team, enjoyed his first major success as Tipp defeated arch-rivals Cork to take the National League title. Both sides met again in the Munster Championship with Tipp recording another victory. The men from the 'premier county' later defeated Limerick by 1-16 to 2-10, giving Stakelum a Munster medal. He subsequently lined out in his first All-Ireland final at senior level. Surprisingly, Laois were the opponents on that occasion, however, the result was expected.

Nicky Rackard had been Wexford's star goal-poacher throughout the year, however, his artistry was beaten by Tony Reddin in the Tipperary goal-mouth. S√©amus Bannon, Tim Ryan and Paddy Kenny got the goals in the second quarter that did the damage, however, Tipp forged ahead to win by 7-7 to 3-9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 351 It was Stakelum's third consecutive All-Ireland medal. For the next three years Stakelum's Tipperary side were defeated by Cork in the Munster championship. It wasn't the end of his playing days, however, as he captured further National League honours in 1952, 1954, 1955 and 1957. Provincial Pat Stakelum also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling championship where he played alongside his championship rivals Christy Ring, Tom Cheasty and Jimmy Smyth. He first tasted success with his province in 1950 as Munster defeated Leinster to take the Railway Cup title. Both Munster and Leinster qualified for the Railway Cup final again in 1951. With Pat playing a key role Munster claimed a second consecutive victory over their great rivals. 1952 saw the Munster men capture a third successive title, this time following a victory over Connacht. In 1953 it was four in-a-row for Pat and for Munster as Leinster were accounted for once again. After a defeat by Leinster in the Railway Cup final of 1954 Pat won a fifth title in 1955 after Connacht were beaten once again. In 1957 Pat Stakelum captured a final Railway Cup medal as MUnster accounted for Leinster once again. Post-playing career Following Stakelum's retirement from club and inter-county hurling he moved into the administrative side of the GAA. He served as secretary of the Tipperary County Board in 1961 and 1962, a period which saw Tipp capture back-to-back All- Ireland titles. In the 1970s Stakelum helped set up the D√∫rlas √ìg Club in Thurles. It was a move which kick-started the rejuvenation of Gaelic games in the town where the association was founded. Stakelum served as a selector on a number of Tipperary senior hurling teams and saw his nephews, Richard and Conor Stakelum and Bobby and Aidan Ryan achieve success with Tipperary.

Damarwulan is a Javanese legendary hero who appears in a cycle of stories used in the performance of wayang klitik, as well as Langendriya (female dance-opera) and ketoprak (popular theater). These stories tell of the struggles between the Majapahit and Blambangan kingdoms, in which Damarwulan gains honor. The stories are especially popular in East Java. Origin The Damarwulan legend is associated with the Majapahit court at the time of the queen Suhita, at which time there was a war with Blambangan. However, the names of the characters Damar Wulan (\\"radiance of the moon\\") and Menak Jingga (\\"red knight\\") suggest that it may incorporate elements of an older sun-moon myth. It is uncertain when the story was (MSS.Jav.89) was donated to the Library in 1815. It is thought to date to the late 18th century, and \\"begins with the accession of the daughter of Brawijaya (Kusuma Kancana Wungu) to the throne of Majapahit.\\"Letter of Damar Wulan, (MSS.Jav.89). British Library, via the World Digital Library. Characters * Prabu Kenya, also known as Queen Kencanawungu, the maiden queen regnant of Majapahit * Patih Lohgender, her prime minister * Layang Seta and Layang Kumitir, the prime minister's twin sons * Dewi Anjasmara, the prime minister's daughter * Damarwulan, the prime minister's nephew, raised away from court by his grandfather * Menak Jingga, the King of Blambangan, a vassal of Majapahit * Dewi Wahita and Dewi Puyengan, princesses held captive by Menak Jingga as concubines * Sabdapalon and Nayagenggong, Damarwulan's servants Synopsis Depiction of the villain Menak Jingga in a wayang klitik puppet. Damarwulan is a prince by birth, a nephew of the prime minister, Patih Lohgender, but was raised in the hermitage of his grandfather. Following his grandfather's advice, he goes to the Majapahit court seeking worldly experiences and employment. His cousins, the arrogant Layang Seta and Layang Kumitir, the prime minister's sons, mistreat him when he arrives. Patih Lohgender, not wanting him to compete with his own sons, assigns him as grass-cutter and stableboy to attends Lohgender's horses. Though he is stripped of his fine garments and works as a humble servant in stable, Damarwulan still looks strikingly handsome. The rumors of a handsome stableboy eventually reach Anjasmara, the prime minister's daughter. She seeks him out secretly and they fall in love and are clandestinely married. One night, Anjasmara's brothers overhear voices in her chamber. They break in to find Damarwulan in Anjasmara's chamber, and try to kill him, but he is able to overcome them. They flee to their father, who orders that Damarwulan be executed. Anjasmara pleas for her lover, and he doesn't execute Damarwulan, but imprisons the pair. Meanwhile, Menak Jingga, the king of Blambangan has written a letter to the Queen Kencanawungu asking for her hand. When the queen rejects him, he declares war on the Majapahit kingdom. He is successful in dispatching Majapahit's allies, and finally the kingdom is threatened by his forces directly. In distress, the queen announces that whoever kills Menak Jingga and brings her his head can have her hand. Worried when no saviors present themselves, she has a divine revelation that a young knight named Damarwulan can overcome him. She orders Patih Lohgender to release him from jail and send him forth on his mission. Damarwulan, accompanied by his servants, makes his way to Blambangan. Arriving at night, he sneaks into the gardens and manages to overhear a conversation at the pavilion between two resentful captive princesses, Dewi Wahita and Dewi Puyengan, that are forced to be the concubines of Menak Jingga. Damarwulan enters the pavilion and confides in them, enamoured by his charm and good looks, they fall in love and become devoted to him. At this time, Menak Jingga decides to visit the princesses, and discovers Damarwulan. They fight, but Damarwulan is unable to hurt Menak Jingga, and severely wounded, appears to die. Menak Jingga leaves, ordering his servants to guard the body. However, when they fall asleep the two princesses carry him away, nurture him, and explain to the secret of Menak Jingga's magic invulnerability, a club of yellow iron kept behind his headrest. If the king is hit on his left temple with this club, he will die. Risking their lives for the sake of their lover, the princesses manage to steal the club while the Menak Jingga is asleep. A second battle between Menak Jingga and Damarwulan follows, in which Damarwulan manages to behead the king. Successful, he returns to Majapahit, but the prime minister's twin sons ambush him outside the palace, killing him and presenting Menak Jingga's head to the queen. However, Damarwulan was not died yet, a hermit rescues and revives Damarwulan. Finally the queen learns what happened to Damarwulan. In a final battle, Damarwulan defeats his cousins. Damarwulan is crowned as the King of Majapahit, and is permitted to retain Anjasmara as his other wife, also Dewi Wahita and Dewi Puyengan as his concubines. Notes References * Claire Holt.

His novels, interviews, novellas, cartoons and short stories have been carried major print magazines and collections. He has also contributed key elements to screenplays for Hollywood films.  Biography  George Mandel was born in New York City. Mandel was educated at the Pratt Institute, The Art Students League of New York and The New School. Before the war Mandel was a cartoonist whose drawings established the first masked female comicbook hero, The Woman in Red. He did a tour of duty during World War 2. He is a Purple Heart veteran of multiple wounds in four World War 2 campaigns. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post The National World War II Museum gratefully added to its collection his essay, \\"Men Weep,\\" which he contributed in September 2014. It is an account of his service and his reaction to the Battle of the Bulge.  Works  His first book, Flee the Angry Strangers (1952), was one of the first Beat novels. His subsequent works include The Breakwater (1960), a coming-of-age novel and Proustian examination of pre-war Coney Island; a 1961 war novel Into the Woods of the World, and The Wax Boom (1962), a war novel. His novella Scapegoats (1970) is a commentary on New York City's racial tension and urban renewal. He further explored the theme in Crocodile Blood (1985), an epic about the rape of a Native American Seminole and the rising complex of cultures across three generations in Florida.

Established in 1966, members include record collectors, discographers, and audio engineers, together with librarians, curators, archivists, and researchers.http://www.arsc-audio.org/about.html History ARSC was founded in 1966Howard Klein, \\"The Voice of the Collector Is Heard in the Land,\\" New York Times, March 6, 1966. by a group of academics, primarily music librarians, who felt that contemporary professional associations such as the Music Library Association (MLA) were not paying enough attention to the special needs of recorded sound archives, and that scholars were giving too little attention to historical recorded sound as opposed to printed sources.Tim Brooks, \\"ARSC: Association For Recorded Sound collections -- An Unusual Organization\\", Goldmine, February, 1983, pp. 22-23. In contrast to professional organizations such as the MLA and the American Library Association, ARSC by design also welcomed private record collectors, since they held (and needed to preserve) many important recordings that were not present in institutional collections. Furthermore, ARSC was intended to bring together collectors from all genres, classical, jazz, popular, etc., as well as those concerned with spoken word recordings. After three organizational meetings in 1965 and 1966, and the election of its first president, Philip L. Miller, Chief of the Music Division, New York Public Library, ARSC's first annual conference was held at Indiana University in March 1967. Its first publication was the Preliminary Directory of Sound Recording Collections in the United States and Canada (1967), listing 1,500 public and private collections. This was followed by the launch of the ARSC Journal (1968), the ARSC Newsletter (1977), and other publications. Other important projects have included The Rigler-Deutsch Index, a union catalog of the 615,000 78 rpm holdings of five major public archives.Elwood McKee, \\"ARSC/AAA: Fifteen Years of Cooperative Research,\\" ARSC Journal, Volume 20 No. 1 (Spring 1989), 3-13. Data from this massive project is now part of the WorldCat online library catalog. ARSC is governed by an eight-person board of directors, seven of whom are elected biennially by the membership. The eighth, the executive director, is appointed by the president with the approval of the board, is non-voting, and handles day-to-day operations. In the early years ARSC's leadership consisted primarily of professional archivists, but in later years it broadened to include scholars and private collectors, several of whom have served as president. A historical listing of officers and committee chairs can be found on the association's website. Although ARSC is based in the U.S., about ten percent of its membership is located in other countries. The association maintains close relations with the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) and is a member of the Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations (CCAAA), an international umbrella group concerned with audiovisual preservation matters worldwide.http://www.ccaaa.org Presidents * 2020-2022 - Rebecca Chandler * 2018-2020 - Cary Ginell * 2016-2018 - Matthew Barton * 2014-2016 - Patrick Feaster * 2012-2014 - Tim Brooks * 2010-2012 - Vincent Pelote * 2008-2010 - David Seubert * 2006-2008 - Sam Brylawski * 2004-2006 - Brenda Nelson-Strauss * 2002-2004 - James Farrington * 2000-2002 - Mark Tolleson * 1998-2000 - Suzanne Stover * 1996-1998 - Ted P.

The Preservation of Classical Music Historical Recordings Grants Program supports ‚Äúthe preservation of historically significant sound recordings of Western Art Music.‚Äù ARSC also provides a modest number of Travel Grants for first-time attendees at the annual conference.http://www.arsc- audio.org/committees/grant-programs.html Email discussion list and social media ARSClist is an unmoderated email discussion list sponsored by ARSC. Subscription is open to members and to the archival community at large.http://www.arsc-audio.org/arsclist.html ARSC also has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, among other places. Committees Copyright and Fair Use Since 2005, the Copyright and Fair Use Committee has led the organization in advocating for changes in U.S. copyright laws to ensure the preservation of and public access to historical sound recordings. This has included testimony at U.S. Copyright Office hearings and a number of studies and position papers. Currently, there are no sound recordings in the public domain. Recordings made after 1972 are covered by Federal copyright laws; pre-1972 recordings remain under state laws until 2067 (assuming that copyright term will not be extended again). Making copies of recordings is a violation of copyright law; therefore, libraries and archives may not legally be able to perform necessary preservation work. Public access is limited by rights holders who will neither release historical material nor allow others to do so. In 2009 ARSC was instrumental in securing legislation directing the Copyright Office to study the status of pre-1972 recordings, which resulted in a Copyright Office recommendation that Congress address this problem.Tim Brooks, \\"ARSC Secures Historic Legislation,\\" ARSC Newsletter, No. 120 (Summer 2009), 1, 11. ARSC also favors changes in copyright law related to orphan works.Tim Brooks, \\"The Association for Recorded Sound Collections and the Movement to Reform Copyright in the United States,\\" Popular Music and Society, Volume 35, Issue 5, 2012, pp. 683-689. In 2008 ARSC co-founded with other organizations the Historical Recording Coalition for Access and Preservation to pursue these issues,http://www.recordingcopyright.org and the Copyright and Fair Use Committee keeps members informed of news related to sound recording copyright and fair use issues.http://www.arsc-audio.org/copyright- committee.html Technical The Technical Committee focuses on audio technology, providing guidance to institutions and audio professionals in preserving and maintaining access to sound recordings.http://www.arsc- audio.org/committees/technical-committee.html Education and Training The Education and Training Committee provides publications and online resources, and conducts a workshop at the annual conference covering topics that have included copyright, grant applications, disaster recovery, and the preservation and handling of digital resources.http://www.arsc- audio.org/committees/et-committee.html See also * Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Association * UNESCO Memory of the World * UNESCO World Day for Audiovisual Heritage * Optical media preservation References External links * Association For Recorded Sound Collections * U.S. Copyright - Federal Copyright Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings * Guide to the Rigler-Deutsch Index (ARS.0105) at Stanford University * Historical Recording Coalition for Access and Preservation * Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) records, at the University of Maryland libraries Category:Sound recording Category:History organizations based in the United States Category:Library-related professional associations Category:Archivist associations ","title":"Association for Recorded Sound Collections"},{"id":"12445183","text":"Conopias is a genus of birds in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae.

While most of the minivets have shades of yellow, orange and red in their plumage, this species has only greys, whites and blacks. The male is distinctive with a white face and black nape although females can be confused with the female of the brown-rumped minivet. They forage in the canopy, often along with other minivets and join mixed-species foraging flocks. Description Patterning of the male It is 18.5‚Äì20 cm long. The male is grey above and whitish below. It has a black cap with a white forehead and there is a white band across the flight-feathers. The outer tail feathers are white. The bill and feet are black. The female's cap is grey apart from a black band between the bill and eye and a narrow white band above it. The call is a high-pitched, metallic trill. It is considered as closely related to Pericrocotus roseus and Pericrocotus cantonensis but differs in moult pattern. It is one of the few passerine birds that moult their primaries twice in a year and is the longest distance migrant among the minivets. It breeds in south-east Siberia, north-east China, Korea and Japan. Birds in the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands of southern Japan are commonly considered to be a separate species-- Ryukyu minivet (P. tegimae). The ashy minivet is a long distance migrant, wintering in South and South-east Asia as far south as Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines. It is found in forest as well as in more open areas with scattered trees. It forages in the tree canopy for insects sometimes joining mixed-species foraging flocks. Migrant birds can often be seen in large flocks. The status of the species is considered to be secure and is considered as a \\"least concern\\" species by the IUCN. Populations of the species on the Amami Island was found to have increased from 1985‚Äì2001. In the South Asian region, they are considered rare. They were first noted on the Indian mainland only in 1965 although they had been reported in 1897 from the Andaman Islands. It has since been reported with greater regularity. Four to seven eggs are laid. These are incubated for 17 to 18 days. Notes References *Brazil, Mark A.

Wielema \\"Adriaan Koerbagh. A light shining in dark places, to illuminate the main questions of theology and religion\\". Leiden: Brill, p. 1-39. Life Adriaan Koerbagh studied at the universities of Utrecht and Leiden, becoming a doctor in medicine and master in jurisprudence. He was one of the most radical figures of the Age of Enlightenment, rejecting and reviling the church and state as unreliable institutions and exposing theologians' and lawyers' language as vague and opaque tools to blind the people in order to maintain their own power. Koerbagh put the authority of reason above that of dogmas and was thus seen as a true freethinker, although twentieth century notions of him as an anarchist or libertarian cannot be applied with certainty. Koerbagh described the Bible and dogmas like the Trinity and the divine nature of Christ as only the work of men. Also, like his contemporary Baruch de Spinoza, he argued that God is identical with nature and that nothing exists outside of nature. Therefore, he argued, natural science, not theology, was the real theology of the world. In his views about the secularization of the Republic of the Netherlands and the limitation of ecclesiastical powers, he argued that religion is irrational and only maintains its position through deception and violence. He wrote in books 't Nieuw Woorden-Boeck der Regten\\" (The New Dictionary of Rights, 1664), and in \\"Een Bloemhof van allerley lieflijkheyd\\" (A Flower Garden of All Sorts of Delights, 1668), under the pseudonym Vreederijk Waarmond. This book explained various technical terms and foreign words. The Church authorities were offended by the dictionary's articles on religious and political topics, forcing Koerbagh to flee to Culemborg, a legally autonomous town in another province that would not extradite him, and then to Leiden. Adriaan Koerbagh fiercely opposed the Dutch Reformed Church in his third work, \\"Een Ligt schynende in duystere plaatsen, om te verligten de voornaamste saaken der Godsgeleerdtheyd en Godsdienst\\" (A Light Shining In Dark Places, To Shed Light On Matters Of Theology and Religion). He went to Leiden, where he was betrayed by his printer, who knew the contents of his work, and arrested by the authorities. His brother Johannes was also arrested. In 1668, he was found guilty of blasphemy and was sentenced to 10 years in the Rasphuis jail at Amsterdam, where he had to do forced labour, followed by exile and a 4000 guilder fine. He died a few months later in 1669 in the Rasphuis due to the pressures of prison life. His publications were largely destroyed by the authorities of the Republic. His brother Johannes was released because of lack of evidence against him, but he never published again. He died three years later, in 1672.

Born in Borrisoleigh, County Tipperary, Finn first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Thurles CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1950-49 National Hurling League. Finn was a regular member of the starting fifteen for the next decade, and won three All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and six National League medals. Finn captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1951. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Finn won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a three-time championship medallist with Borris-Ileigh. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1960 championship. Finn is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at right wing-back on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984. Playing career Club Finn was barely out of the minor ranks when he first lined out for the Borris-Ileigh senior team. He won his first county championship in 1949 following an emphatic victory in the final. Borris-Ileigh were back in the county decider again in 1950, with Finn winning a second consecutive championship medal after a defeat of Carrick Swans. Finn won a third and final championship medal in 1953 following a 4‚Äì8 to 4‚Äì4 defeat of Boherlahan. Inter-county Minor After enjoying little success with the Tipperary minor team in his debut season, Finn was eligible for the grade again in 1949. A narrow 5‚Äì6 to 5‚Äì5 defeat of Clare in the provincial decider gave him his sole Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Tipperary against Kilkenny. Tipperary had a greater goal-threat amongst their forwards and powered to a comfortable 6‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4 victory, giving Finn an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Beginnings Finn was still a member of the Tipperary minor team when he made his senior debut in the National League of 1949/50. Tipperary had won the Munster Senior Title in 1949. However, he was not a member of that side. Tipperary retained their provincial crown in 1950, however, Finn missed the game. He was restored to the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1950, with age-old rivals Kilkenny providing the opposition. In a dull affair, Tipp looked to be heading for victory when Paddy Kenny scored a goal to put the team four points ahead with just one minute left to play. Kilkenny fought back and a Jimmy Kelly goal from the puck-out reduced the deficit to just one point again. As \\"the Cats\\" were about to launch one final attack, the referee blew the whistle and Tipperary had won by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Finn. He rounded off the year by winning a first National Hurling League medal following a 1‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of New York. In 1951 Finn was just nineteen-years-old when he was appointed captain of the Tipperary senior team. The team's dominance of the provincial championship continued, with Finn lining out against Cork in the Munster decider. Cork's Christy Ring gave one of his best displays, however, the Tipperary full-back line of John Doyle, Tony Brennan and Mickey \\"the Rattler\\" Byrne also gave a defiant performance. A 2‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì9 victory gave Finn a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider against Wexford on 2 September 1951 provided Tipperary with the chance to secure a hat-trick of championship titles for the first time in over half a century. Nicky Rackard, Wexford's goal-scoring machine, was nullified by Tipp goalkeeper Tony Reddin, while S√©amus Bannon, Tim Ryan and Paddy Kenny scored key goals which powered Tipp to a 7‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì9 victory. It was Finn's second All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup as captain. Fallow period Finn won a second National League medal in 1952, as New York were bested on a 6‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì5 score line. The dream of a fourth successive All-Ireland triumph came to an end when Cork defeated Tipperary in the provincial decider. Tipperary went into a period of decline following this, as Cork and Wexford had a stranglehold on the All-Ireland crown. In spite of this, Finn added three more National League medals to his collection following defeats of Kilkenny in 1954 as captain, Wexford in 1955 and Kilkenny again in 1957. A third All-Ireland In 1958 Finn won a third Munster medal as Tipperary regained the provincial crown following a 4‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì5 trouncing of reigning champions Waterford. Tipp later defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 7 September 1958. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley. Liam Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipperary in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a seventy- yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipp won the game by 4‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì5 giving Finn his third and final All-Ireland medal. Finn won a sixth National League medal in 1959 following a 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì7 defeat of Waterford, however, Tipperary subsequently surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns.

The male is distinguished by its orange crown, black face and white throat, while the female has brown plumage. Taxonomy French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the black- cheeked gnateater in 1818, giving it the species name melanops from the Ancient Greek words melas \\"black\\" and ops \\"face\\". The black-cheeked gnateater has three subspecies: *C. m. perspicillata (Lichtenstein, MHK, 1823) \\\\- Bahia and Sergipe (eastern Brazil) *C. m. melanops (Vieillot, 1818) \\\\- southeastern Brazil *C. m. nigrifrons Pinto, 1954 \\\\- Para√≠ba to Alagoas (eastern Brazil) Description Measuring 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the black-cheeked gnateater is a small round bird with a short tail. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, as the male has distinctive coloured plumage and the female is a more overall brown in color. The male has a black face and cheeks with a contrasting orange crown and white throat. The upperparts are brownish and the underparts pale grey, the belly feathers more white and the flanks tending to buff. The female is more brown above with a white eyebrow and buff patch on the wings. It resembles the rufous gnateater. Distribution and habitat The black-cheeked gnateater is found in eastern Brazil, from Para√≠ba to Santa Catarina. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, where it is a bird of the understory and forest floor. Its range along the eastern coastal areas of Brazil has been fragmented by destruction of habitat. Despite the showy plumage, this and other gnateaters are furtive and not often seen. Behaviour The black-cheeked gnateater is monogamous and territorial, the average size for a territory measured at 2.94 hectares. Breeding takes place over three months and the platform-like nest is constructed on branches or a palm leaf near the ground. A clutch of two eggs is laid.

It is an uncommon and little-known bird, an often overlooked endemic of remote areas in central Australia. Taxonomy Currently placed as a species of the genus Conopophila and classified within the honeyeater family Meliphagidae, Conopophila whitei was first described by A. J. North in 1910 as Lacustroica whitei. The population continued to be assigned to a monotypic genus Lacustroica, or as most closely related to two other species, the rufous-banded (Conopophila rufogularis) and rufous-throated (C. albogularis) honeyeaters. The species was found by F. Lawson Whitlock in 1903 at Lake Austin in Western Australia, but no formal description was made. The two specimens he shot and prepared were sent to the Western Australian Museum, about which he received no reply. At the beginning of his later expedition, in 1909, Whitlock killed and skinned a male of the species, recognised as the same he collected in 1903, and located the preparation of a nest by a breeding pair close to the town-site of Wiluna. Whitlock also noted the location of other nesting sites on his journeys around Wiluna, all of which he found had been removed when he returned to them. He continued to observe the progress of the nest near the main street, that had remained undisrupted, eventually removing the branch that held it for his collection. These specimens were supplied to North for the first accepted description, published the following year. The specific epithet whitei honours Alfred Henry Edsworth White, the son of ornithologist Henry L. White. The generic name Conopophila is derived from the Ancient Greek konops 'gnat' and philos '-loving'. The image accompanying North's description in Emu (1910) was captioned with the name 'Alfred Honey-eater'.Emu vol. 9. plate 15. April 1, 1910 The informal names for this species also include White's honeyeater and inconspicuous honeyeater. The IOC World Bird List has proposed grey honeyeater as the common name for this species. Description A tiny honeyeater, grey and discreet, with a nondescript colouration that is only faintly marked. The length is . The plumage of the upper body is generally cold grey, the lower parts paler, becoming browner until a moult. Tail and flight feathers are a blackish brown, and a slightly darker marking extends across the eye to the bill. The tips of the tail feathers are white, aging to buffish. The bill is relatively short for a honeyeater, slightly down-curved and grey, becoming black toward the tip. There is a pale and indistinct ring of feathers, tinted buff, around the eye. The colour of the iris is brown, the legs are steel grey. Juveniles have a faintly yellowish cast to the thin eye-ring, that almost disappears as they mature, and on the pale grey feathers of the throat. The grey flight feathers of the immature birds have a yellow-green wash. The grey honeyeater is similar in appearance to the Western gerygone (Gerygone fusca), yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa) and others of the genus Acanthiza, all of which it often accompanies in mixed species flocks.Simpson, Ken, Day, N. and Trusler, P. (6th edn., 1999). Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Ringwood, Victoria: Penguin Books Australia . Care should be taken to distinguish the grey honeyeater from the female redthroat (Pyrrholaemus brunneus) Voice The most common call of the grey honeyeater has been described as a piercing, metallic, quick, double squeak \\"chirra-wik-chirra-wik\\", or \\"cre-seek\\" and somewhat resembling the call of the white-bellied cuckooshrike (Coracina papuensis). It also makes a weak, grating, high-pitched tinkling or a plaintive series of notes given in quick succession, sounding like \\"troo-whee, troo-whee\\". Distribution and habitat \\"The Alfred Honey-eater (Lacustroica whitei. North) (The lowest figure in youthful plumage) Drawing by Ellis Rowan\\". Emu. vol. 9. 1910 The grey honeyeater is found in a range extending across the mid-west to the centre of the Australian continent, especially in the Pilbara and Murchison regions of Western Australia, and southern and central Northern Territory. It is rare to uncommon and probably sedentary with some nomadic movement. The species is found in semi-arid mulga (Acacia aneura) and similar acacia scrublands.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. The occurrence of mistletoe may be an important factor in determining its distribution. Some good locations for finding the grey honeyeater are the Olive Pink Botanic Garden, Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, and Wanjarri Nature Reserve, south of Wiluna, and Tom Price, in Western Australia. Behaviour Breeding The breeding season is August to November, which may extend through to May, if there is summer rain. The nest is a small, frail, untidy cup of fine grass stems, lined with hair and plant down, bound with spider web, hanging from slender twigs in the outer foliage of a mulga shrub. A clutch of 1 or 2 eggs, each measuring , is laid. The eggs are swollen oval and slightly glossy white, spotted with reddish-brown. Incubation is probably by both sexes, as is the feeding of nestlings and fledglings. Feeding The grey honeyeater is primarily insectivorous, busily gleaning the surface of foliage for lerp and similar insects or hovering to capture flying insects.Higgins, P., L. Christidis, and H. Ford (2020). \\"Gray Honeyeater (Conopophila whitei), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.gryhon1.01 It also feeds on nectar by piercing the deep, tubular flowers of species such as Eremophila, and on the nectar and berries of mistletoe. Conservation Status The grey honeyeater is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. It is considered as endangered in Western Australia. Threats are uncontrolled fires from which mulga takes many years to recover, and also grazing by introduced animals that damage the habitat.

Other anglicised forms include, Felan and Faelan. An alternate pronunciation is /fi:l…ôn/, but in some parts of Kilkenny there is also use of /fe…™.l…ôn/ or even /we…™.l…ôn/. This happens because the name comes from the same origin as Whelan, and the Irish form itself is pronounced /fe:lan/. The O'Faelan (O'Harts spelling) clan name is claimed to have descended from Fiacha Suidhe, one of the younger brothers of Conn Ceadcathach or Conn of the Hundred Battles. Fiacha Suidhe is said to have been expelled from Meath and after various wanderings was given permission to settle in lands around Waterford which were called the Desies. This origin story, the Expulsion of the Deisi, is covered by Power which is believed to be a fictitious tale created by prominent families of the Desies to justify their elevation to Gaelic nobility from a former tributary status.  Early Medieval and Viking Era  Keating speaks of Cellach√°n Caisil King of Munster plundering the town of Waterford causing its leader Sitiric to take flight. After which, Cellach√°n gave his sister Gormfhlaith in marriage to Domhnall O Faolain, king of the Deise. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, in 995, Donnavan son of Ivar and Domhnall son of Faelan, Lord of the Deisi killed Gillapatrick son of Donnchadh, lord of Osraighe. Donnoavan was killed in revenge for this deed a week later, Domhnall son of Faelan is later recorded as having died but the cause is unknown. Keating also has Domhnall O Faolain, king of the Deise and Ivar of Waterford invading and plundering Munster. Brian B√≥ruma then gave battle and defeated them at Fan mic Connrach, they were then chased to Waterford where Domhnall and most of the foreigners (Ostmen) were slain and the town was plundered and burned. It is not clear when this is supposed to have happened or if this is the same Domhnall O Faolain reported in the Annals of the Four Masters as having died in 995. Mothla Son of Domhnall son of Faelan, Lord of the Deisi-Mumhan was present at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. This time an O Faelan is fighting alongside Brian against the combined forces of the King of Leinster and the Norse Gaels. The Cogadh Gaedhel Re Gallaibh places Mothla with Magnus King of the Ui Liathain at the head of Brian‚Äôs second battalion, which is described as very great and strong and formed from the chosen hosts of all Munster. Both the Annals and the Cogadh report Mothla‚Äôs death at this battle along with Brian, his sons, the King of Leinster, many of the Norse Gael leaders and numerous others. In, 1031 the annals record the death of Diarmaid, son of Domhnall, son of Faelan, lord of the Deisi, who was killed by Muircheartach, son of Brian, in the battle of Sliabh Cua. In 1051, Muircheartach, son of Breac, (another noble family of the Deisi) lord of the Deisi, was burned by the Ua Faelains. In 1059, another O'Breac, is killed by the Ua Faelain, on this occasion Maelseachlainn Ua Bric and Tomaltach Ua Maelbhrenainn, lord of Sil-Muireadhaigh were both smothered in a cave by Maelseachlainn, son of Gillabrighde, son of Faelan. In 1067, in what appears to be an act of revenge, Maelseachlainn is blinded by the O'Breac having been delivered to them by Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain. Later in 1168, Ua Faelain, lord of the Deisi-Mumhan along with Diarmaid Finn are recorded as killing a grandson of Conchobhar Ua Briain. This grandson had slain Muircheartach Ua Briain, King of Munster, and royal heir of Ireland. Finn and Ua Faelain are recorded as killing this grandson of Conchobhar Ua Briain as well as his co-conspirators in revenge.  Norman Period  In 1170, O‚ÄôPhelan Prince of the Desies, provided military assistance to the Ostmen of Waterford in an Irish/Ostmen coalition against the Norman adventurer Raymond FitzGerald who had landed at a sea cliff around 14 miles from Waterford with a small band of troops of around 100 men. The coalition was also joined by a group from Ossary and O‚ÄôRyan a chieftain of the Odrone. Together they combined with the Vikings and the men of the Desies and formed three bands in which to confront Raymond. Raymond is believed to have sallied forth against this force from a fortified position on the cliff but was overwhelmed and fled to his original position. During this retreat forces from the coalition managed to get a foothold in Raymonds camp. A number of cattle which had previously been collected and kept inside the camp then stampeded the entrance where the attackers were gaining access. This incident caused the Irish and Ostmen to fall into confusion and disarray and Raymond, rallying his men, turned the course of battle falling upon the coalition and turning a potential defeat into victory. 500 of the coalition are said to have been killed, some, being thrown from the cliffs. Melaghlin O‚ÄôPhelan, Prince of the Desies, was amongst the defenders of Waterford during Strowbows (Richard de Clare) taking of the town in the summer of 1170. On the 23rd of August, 1170, Strongbow with 200 knights and around 1000 other men landed in Waterford where he was joined by Raymond. Strongbow and Raymond assaulted Waterford and took the town after a breach was made in the walls. Many citizens are said to have been killed, two Norse leaders of the town, both called Sitric, were executed. A third Norse leader together with Melaghlin O‚ÄôPhelan were spared due to the intervention of Diarmaid Mac Murchadha King of Leinster. Melaghlin O‚ÄôPhelan of the Desies is later found submitting to King Henry II in 1171 during King Henry‚Äôs expedition to Ireland. In 1196, the Annals of the Four Masters record the death of a son O'Faelain (Phelan), of the Desies who was part of a failed expedition into Ulster. It appears that this son of O'Faelain was part of a coalition including Rory Mac Donslevy, the English, and chieftains of Connaught. They marched their army against the Kinel-Owen and Oriors. The Kinel-Owen and the men of Orior gave them battle on a plain in Armagh where Mac Donslevy was defeated with dreadful slaughter with twelve of the sons of the lords and chieftains of Connaught slain, along with many of an inferior grade also slain including the son of O'Faelain of the Desies. In 1205 the annals record the death of Donnell O'Faelain (Phelan), Lord of the Desies. In 1208 the same annals record the death of David Breathnach (Walsh) the Bishop of Waterford who was slain by O'Faelan of the Desies.

It is endemic to Brazil. It was described on the basis of a single male specimen collected in Mato Grosso, Brazil, in 1938. No other individuals were collected or seen and some feared the bird had become extinct, while others speculated that it possibly only was an aberrant black- and-white tanager (unlikely, as the black-and-white tanager only occurs far from the region where the cone-billed was collected). In 2003, it was rediscovered by D. Buzzetti in gallery woodland and Cerrado in the Emas National Park, only to be independently rediscovered at the same locality in 2004 by B. A. Carlos. The male resembles the male black-and-white tanager, but differs by its black flanks and its strikingly whitish-grey bill (this has faded in the type specimen, currently kept in MNHN, where it appears dark dusky-horn). Also, the crissum (the area around the cloaca) of the male is black and frequently has white spots. The plumage of the female is closer to that of the female ultramarine grosbeak than that of the female black-and- white tanager, but a longer, more detailed description is currently being prepared for publication.

It is a beautiful area of the country, filled with green rice fields in the summer and smiling, friendly farmers. Because the road to it was until recently quite bad, there has been minimal development work and limited presence of NGOs in the district. There is no running water, and most residents obtain their water supply from wells and ponds filled during the rainy season. Electricity came to Dang Tung in 2009, but many residents of the district continue to use car batteries as their main source of power, hooking them up to electric light bulbs and phone chargers at home and recharging the batteries at a local generator when needed. There are over 55,000 people in the district.

It is also called the Madagascar magpie-robin. Taxonomy and systematics The Madagascan magpie- robin is closely related to the Seychelles magpie-robin and the Oriental magpie-robin, and may form a superspecies with them. The species is endemic to Madagascar, where it is found across the island. Its distribution is sometimes scattered, as it occupies a wide range of habitats and can be very common or fairly rare depending on this. Three subspecies have been described: the nominate subspecies from northeastern Madagascar, C. a. inexpectatus from eastern and southeastern Madagascar and C. a. pica , which occupies the rest of the country. There is, however, considerable overlap between the subspecies and the exact boundaries between their ranges is unclear.Collar, N. (2017). \\"Madagascar Magpie-robin (Copsychus albospecularis)\\". In: del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., Sargatal, J., Christie, D.A. & de Juana, E. (eds.). Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. Retrieved 2 March 2017. Description The Madagascan magpie-robin is around in length and weighs . The plumage varies by sex; the male of the nominate subspecies has all-black plumage with a white shoulder patch and the female has a grey-brown crown, back and tail, grey-breast and throat and rufous wings and rump. The males of the other two subspecies have more white of the wings and a white abdomen; the female of C. a. pica is much paler overall. Distribution and habitat Madagascan magpie-robins occupy most of the habitats available on the island, from scrubland to dry monsoon forest, humid rainforest, forest edge, mangrove forests, secondary growth, as well as a variety of agricultural land including gardens, banana, coffee and eucalyptus plantations. They can be found from sea level to . Behaviour Diet and feeding The Madagascan magpie-robin feeds in insects, including cockroaches, beetles, bugs and grasshoppers, as well as spiders, earthworms, small lizards and amphibians. They will also take berries. They forage near the ground, and exhibit some niche differentiation between the sexes, with females feeding more regularly on the ground and males feeding higher up in the undergrowth. They also sometimes join mixed-species foraging flocks. Breeding Madagascan magpie-robins are territorial, with pairs defending territories that vary in size depending on habitat type, ranging from less than to . Territories in heavy rainforest or moist montane forest are smaller than those in scrubland. The nest is a cup made from grasses, leaf stalks and lined with rootlets, snakeskin and the hair of lemurs or cattle. The nest is placed in cavities in walls, in hollows in stumps or in dense vegetation. An average clutch size is three eggs (the range is from two to five) and these are incubated for about 13 days. Both parents feed the chicks in the nest for 17 days, and the young continue to be fed outside the nest for at least another six days. Chicks may associate with their parents in small flocks for at least 18 days after fledging. This species is often targeted by the predatory Madagascan sparrowhawk.

It is a medium-sized forest bird, with grey to blue-grey plumage and large black eyes. There are two subspecies that occur in forest patches of southern and central Africa respectively.  Taxonomy  The grey cuckooshrike belongs to the family Campephagidae of the old world songbirds. There are almost 90 species within Campephagidae that occur in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Ceblepyris caesia is often considered to be part of a superspecies with the white-breasted cuckooshrike (Ceblepyris pectoralis); which looks somewhat similar apart from the striking white underparts compared to C. caesia's grey underparts. The grey cuckooshrike is also found at higher elevation than its white-breasted counterpart. A 2010 genetic analysis confirmed the two species as each other's closest relatives, with their common ancestor diverging from the ancestor of Grauer's cuckooshrike. \\"Grey cuckooshrike\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). The species is also commonly referred to as the mountain grey cuckooshrike and the African grey cuckooshrike. South African names include usinga in Pirie Forest, umsimpofu in Elliotdale and around the mouth of the Mthatha River, and umswinkobe in eastern Pondoland.  Subspecies  There are two subspecies of C. caesius that are native to sub-Saharan Africa. The only known variation between these subspecies is their size. C. c. caesius was first described in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, in 1823 by M. H. C. Lichtenstein and occurs in patches of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. C. c. pura described in 1891 occurs in south-eastern parts of Nigeria, western parts of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, eastern parts of South Sudan, north-eastern parts of DRC, Malawi and north-western parts of Mozambique.  Description  The grey cuckooshrike is a medium-sized bird; with a body length of and weighing between . These birds exhibit sexual dimorphism. They both have a blue-grey head and body, with a large jet-black eye with a thin white eye-ring. Their bill and legs are black, and the males have a dark grey loreal patch, while females have grey loreal patches and are a slightly lighter shade of grey. The juveniles are a dark brown with grey-white barring above, white underparts with brown barring, and have black tails with white edges on the tips as well as on their flight feathers.  Habitat and movements  The preferred habitat of the grey cuckooshrike is Afromontane forests, lowland forests, coastal forests and dense woodland areas near rivers. They have also been observed foraging in pine and wattle plantations and trees in the trees of small towns in winter. They usually occur at elevations above in West Africa and in Central and East Africa, but also frequent coastal areas below in East Africa. In Zimbabwe and South Africa they are found at or lower elevations. They are largely resident species but do undertake post-breeding movementsa during the dry season. In the Cameroon, migration to lower elevations has been recorded after the breeding season. In South Africa, the birds migrate from forests in the Northern highveld to forests in the lowveld. They are frequent visitors to eastern and Western Cape coastal areas in the winter.  Behaviour and ecology   Feeding  The grey cuckooshrike is insectivorous; feeding mostly on crickets, caterpillars and locusts. Spiders, winged termites and beetles also form a part of their diet. They forage in the upper forest canopy, looking for insects in the foliage and on tree trunks. They hop on branches and examine the underside of the leaves above for insects, when they see one they snatch the prey and return to their perch before eating it.  Breeding  In Southern Africa, breeding occurs in the summer months between October and January, and nest building has been recorded as early as September in the most southern parts of South Africa. The central African subspecies breeds during the rainy season, but avoids the wettest periods. {  +Breeding periods of grey cuckooshrike in various African countries !Country !Breeding months - Cameroon Nov - DRC Jan‚ÄìJun and Aug - Ethiopia Feb‚ÄìMar - Kenya Jan‚ÄìMar; Aug, Oct and Dec - Malawi Sept - Sudan Aug and Dec - Tanzania Jan‚ÄìMar; Aug, Oct and Dec - Uganda Jan‚ÄìMar; Aug, Oct and Dec } Their nests are a shallow bowl shape and constructed by both sexes from Usnea lichen and spider webs, perched 17 to 20 meters up in trees on the forest edge. The clutch size is one or two eggs which are an oval shape and pale bluish-green with olive and brown spots. The chicks are black with grey down when they hatch, and remain in the nest until the following breeding season. Both the male and female incubate the eggs, but little else is known about the incubation or fledging periods. They are monogamous breeders and will stay in that pair until one dies; and the surviving individual will seek a new mate.  Social behaviour and calls  The grey cuckooshrike is somewhat inconspicuous, making observations about its behaviour challenging. They are usually observed alone or in pairs and less frequently in small groups of up to 7 individuals. During the non-breeding season they have been seen foraging in mixed species flocks. Their flight is described as \\"slow and level with heavy wing beats\\". These are relatively quiet birds, their call is described as a faint, high-pitched \\"tseeeeep\\" while foraging and a \\"seeeeea\\" call at their nests. Other calls include a weaver-like chatter and sneeze-like \\"chi-ooo\\" sounds.  Relationship with humans  The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list has rated the grey cuckooshrike as least concern, indicating it is not threatened. Population size is unknown but is thought to be decreasing due to deforestation. Population density in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa was calculated to be around six individuals per . They are not considered to be common or easily spotted, this is partly due to them living in the forest canopy and partly due to their inconspicuous nature. They are tolerant of humans, and have been spotted in trees of urban areas and residential gardens.

McMillan played for an IFA selection and the senior team of the FAI. Club career McMillan joined Belfast Celtic in 1932 and remained with the club until they withdrew from the Irish League in 1949. In 1936 he was a member of the Celtic reserve team that reached the final of the County Antrim Shield, only to lose 1‚Äì0 to the senior Celtic team. He subsequently established himself as a regular member of the senior team, playing alongside the likes of Jimmy McAlinden, Jackie Vernon, Charlie Tully, Tom Aherne, Robin Lawler, Jimmy Jones and Johnny Campbell. During the 1930s and 1940s this Celtic team dominated Northern Irish football. During the summer of 1949 McMillan also played with Celtic on their tour of North America. Other members of the touring party included Aherne, Lawler, Campbell, guest player Mick O'Flanagan and manager Elisha Scott. These were the last games Belfast Celtic played before the club disbanded. The highlight of the 10 game tour came on 29 May when Celtic beat Scotland 2‚Äì0 at Triborough Stadium. On returning from the tour, McMillan joined Ballymena United as a player manager.Paradise Lost and Found: The Story of Belfast Celtic (1999):Padraig Coyle The Complete Who's Who of Irish International Football, 1945‚Äì96 (1996):Stephen McGarrigle Belfast Celtic North America tour results In 1951, McMillan signed for Crusaders where he stayed for one season. Irish international When McMillan played as an international in 1945 and 1946 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland- based IFA and the Republic of Ireland-based FAI selected players from all 32 counties. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including McMillan, played for both teams. IFA XI Between 1944 and 1946, McMillan made at least four appearances for the IFA XI. On 9 September 1944 he played in the 8‚Äì4 defeat against a Combined Services XI at Windsor Park. This team was basically a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen.Wartime internationals McMillan also played in three Victory internationals. On 15 September 1945 he played against England in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Windsor Park. Then on 2 February 1946 he also played in the 3‚Äì2 defeat to Scotland, once again at Windsor Park. On 4 May 1946 he made his fourth appearance for the IFA XI in a 1‚Äì0 win against Wales at Ninian Park.Soccer at War ‚Äì 1939 ‚Äì 45 (2005): Jack Rollin However, none of the matches he appeared in were considered full internationals. FAI XI In 1946 McMillan also made two appearances for the senior team of the FAI. He was one of several players born in Northern Ireland who benefited from the FAI's attempts to establish an all-Ireland influence. In June 1946 when the FAI organised an Iberian tour, McMillan, together with Jackie Vernon, Jimmy McAlinden and Paddy Sloan, was one of four Northern Irish players called up. McMillan was originally a reserve but replaced the injured Bill Hayes and subsequently played in the 3‚Äì1 defeat to Portugal on 16 June and in the 1‚Äì0 win against Spain on 23 June.The Boys In Green ‚Äì The FAI International Story (1997): Sean RyanIreland (FAI) stats Honours Belfast Celtic *Irish League **Winners 1936‚Äì37, 1937‚Äì38, 1938‚Äì39, 1939‚Äì40, 1947‚Äì48: 5 *Northern Regional League **Winners 1940‚Äì41, 1941‚Äì42, 1943‚Äì44, 1946‚Äì47: 4 **Runners-up 1942‚Äì43: 1 *Irish Cup **Winners 1936‚Äì37, 1937‚Äì38, 1940‚Äì41, 1942‚Äì43, 1943‚Äì44, 1946‚Äì47: 6 *City Cup Winners Cup **Winners 1939‚Äì40, 1947‚Äì48, 1948‚Äì49: 3 *Gold Cup **Winners 1938‚Äì39, 1939‚Äì40, 1940‚Äì41, 1943‚Äì44, 1944‚Äì45, 1945‚Äì46, 1946‚Äì47: 7 *County Antrim Shield **Winners 1936‚Äì37, 1938‚Äì39, 1942‚Äì43, 1944‚Äì45: 4 Belfast Celtic Reserves *County Antrim Shield **Runners-up 1935‚Äì36: 1 References Category:Ballymena United F.C. managers Category:Ballymena United F.C. players Category:Belfast Celtic F.C. players Category:Dual Irish international footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Ireland (FAI) international footballers Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland Category:People from Carrickfergus Category:Ireland (IFA) wartime international footballers Category:Ulster Scots people Category:1991 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Crusaders F.C. players ","title":"Billy McMillan"},{"id":"12445658","text":"The blackish cuckooshrike, blackish cicadabird, or Luzon graybird (Edolisoma coerulescens) is a species of bird in the family Campephagidae.

There were many civilian ships contracted to the Navy to transport military personnel and cargo to the landing area. Once the ships were anchored in place the landings began. There were two or three days of landing men and equipment ashore, then one day of rest for the landing craft. After that, the task force started back loading men and equipment onto the ships. When it was finished, the ships departed for liberty to different ports: the USS Okinawa to La Pallice and La Rochelle, France, and to Plymouth, England.

The name cuckoo-shrike, was developed not because it is affiliated with either the cuckoo bird or the shrike, but because of the similar features that it has to both these birds. The stout, hooked shrike-like beak and the plumage of the bird which is similar to that of the cuckoo, is the reason for the name cuckoo-shrike. The adult bird possesses a pale grey head and upper body, with a black mask around pale yellow eyes. Its lower back, rump and underparts are white and finely barred with black, contrasting with the black wings and the forked black tail. This forked tail is a characteristic specific only to the ground cuckoo-shrike. The immature ground cuckoo-shrike is similar in appearance to the adult, but has fine, broken black barrings on the throat and upper parts and dark eyes with a dark eye-line, instead of a black mask with pale yellow eyes. The flight call of this bird is a distinctive ‚Äòpee-ew, pee- ew‚Äô or ‚Äòchill-chill‚Ä¶.kee-lik, keelick‚Äô. Due to the colouration of the ground cuckoo-shrike, when in flight they can look quite black and white so may be mistaken for an Australian magpie.  Distribution and Habitat  The distribution of the ground cuckoo-bird is widespread across Australia, mainly occurring in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and in some parts of Victoria. They occur mostly inland of the Great Dividing Range in Australia's semi-arid regions, but also occur in areas on the east coast. They have been found to occur in areas of open woodland, arid shrub-land and open grasslands that are dominated by dead trees and species such as mulga, cypress-pine and mallee-spinifex. The ground cuckoo-shrike are more likely to occur in these habitats if they are located near watercourses; floodplains, creeks and wetlands. Because of the location of the preferred habitats, ground cuckoo- shrikes are more frequently found in inland areas rather than coastal regions. Various reports have recorded seeing the ground cuckoo-shrike in their observations, showing them to be present in woodland areas located on river channels and floodplains, Mulga tall shrubland and cleared woodland regrowth areas. Despite their large range throughout Australia, they are an uncommon species, which are thinly distributed and nomadic, which can make it hard to predict their location and where they can be expected to be seen. The current population trend of the ground cuckoo-shrike is said to be decreasing, possibly due to declines in the Murray-Mallee region since the mid 1970s. There are a few places recorded by Dolby and Clarke (2014), in their book that clearly lists and describes places where the ground cuckoo-shrike can be expected to be spotted.  Behaviour   Feeding  The ground cuckoo- shrike, as its name suggests, mainly feeds on the ground, being adapted to this kind of feeding with their long legs and the ability to run quickly along the ground. They spend a lot of their time foraging on bare open ground in small groups for their food which consists of mainly on insects because they are insectivores. Their diet includes adult and larvae insects such as praying mantis, grasshoppers, locust, ants and spiders.  Breeding and nesting  Ground cuckoo-shrikes are generally encountered in small groups of three or more. This is possibly because the young stay in the family group until the next breeding season, sometimes helping to feed the new young. They make their nests on branches or forks of trees 3 to 15 m high, with bark, grass, stems and other material, or use the old nests of magpie-larks or white-winged chough. The breeding season is from August to November, with the birds forming monogamous pairs and laying between two and five eggs in the nest, which is sometimes shared with other females, as more than one female are known to lay eggs in the same nest during the same breeding season. The eggs are a glossy olive colour with brown/red-brown markings on them.  Threats and Conservation status  Though the population of the ground cuckoo-shrike is decreasing, its conservation status is classed as least concern. In 2013, it was listed as vulnerable in Victoria under the Advisory List of Threatened Vertebrate Fauna in Victoria 2013. A possible threat to the ground cuckoo- shrike is the increase in woody vegetation density. This would benefit most woodland bird species, but in the case of the ground cuckoo-shrike which dwells in open woodland habitats, it could have a detrimental effect on its population.

Two male hostages were executed before the deal was reached between the Taliban and the South Korean government. The group, composed of sixteen women and seven men, was captured while traveling from Kandahar to Kabul by bus on a mission sponsored by the Saemmul Presbyterian Church. The crisis began when two local men, who the driver had allowed to board, started shooting to bring the bus to a halt. Over the next month, the hostages were kept in cellars and farmhouses and regularly moved in groups of three to four. Of the 23 hostages captured, two men, Bae Hyeong-gyu, a 42-year-old South Korean pastor of Saemmul Church, and Shim Seong-min, a 29-year-old South Korean man, were executed on 25 and 30 July, respectively. Later, with negotiations making progress, two women, Kim Gyeong-ja and Kim Ji-na, were released on 13 August and the remaining 19 hostages on 29 and 30 August. The release of the hostages was secured with a South Korean promise to withdraw its 200 troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2007. Although the South Korean government offered no statement, a Taliban spokesman claimed that the militant group also received some US$20 million in exchange for the safety of the captured missionaries. Negotiations As South Korea was already scheduled to withdraw its 200 troops by the end of the year, the Taliban's initial demand was only that they hold to this plan, but later also sought the release of 23 Taliban militants from prison. South Korean representatives in Washington DC requested a meeting with Afghanistan Kidnap / Ransom experts from SCG International Risk on August 1. SCG then began advising the South Koreans on ways to resolve the crisis. The Taliban issued and extended several deadlines for the release of the prisoners, after which they threatened to begin killing the hostages. Freedom for the militants was ruled out when it was apparent the South Korean negotiators could not secure the release of Afghan prisoners, as Afghan president Hamid Karzai had previously faced criticism for freeing five rebel prisoners in exchange for an Italian hostage. Face-to-face meetings between the Taliban and South Korea began on 10 August, resulting in the release of two female hostages, Kim Ji-na and Kim Gyeong-ja, on 13 August. However, on 18 August, a spokesman said that the talks had failed and the fates of the hostages were being considered. Release The freedom of the remaining nineteen hostages (fourteen women and five men) was secured on August 28 with the participation of Indonesia as a neutral Muslim country. They were eventually released on 29 and 30 August. After the release, a Taliban official announced that South Korea had paid the Taliban more than US$20 million in ransom for the lives of the hostages. However, South Korea stated that they have made a promise with the Taliban that they would not make any statements about the ransom. Response Public gatherings were held in South Korea during the capture to pray for the safety of the hostages. Muslims residing in South Korea also expressed their grief regarding the incident and avow that the acts of the Taliban are against the principles of Islam.Muslims here pray for safe homecoming of 22 hostages, JoongAng Daily, July 30, 2007. Many South Koreans nevertheless held numerous protests and demonstrations outside the Seoul Central Mosque. On the other hand, many South Koreans were critical of the hostages, as the hostages were conducting Christian missionary service in Islamic Afghanistan despite the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's repeated warnings that Taliban has plans to kidnap South Koreans in order to free imprisoned militants. Among these criticising the deal from the government as a dangerous precedent was the bishop of Taejon and chairman of Korea Caritas Lazarus You Heung- sik.http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art;=10166&size;=A Timeline On 19 July 2007, a number of South Korean citizens are reported to have been captured by the Taliban from a public bus traveling in the Ghazni Province, from Kandahar to Kabul, and held hostage. The next day the Taliban demanded that all South Korean forces be withdrawn from Afghanistan within 24 hours and also that Afghan president Hamid Karzai release all Taliban inmates. On 21 July South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun gave a national televised speech informing the public of the kidnappings. The Taliban reduced its demand to twenty-three Taliban prisoners in exchange for the lives of the hostages. * On 24 July, the Taliban demanded a sum of $US100,000 in exchange for the right to contact the hostages via phone. The South Korean government refuses. The following day, one of the South Korean hostages was executed. South Korea's foreign ministry identified the victim as 42-year-old South Korean pastor Bae Hyeong-gyu, who was the leader of the group. On 29 July, a final deadline was set by the Taliban for 30 July at 07:30 UTC. The next day, the Taliban extended the deadline for the seventh time by 4 hours to 1130 UTC to give Afghan officials more time to negotiate. A Taliban spokesperson later announced another male hostage had been killed because the government did not cede to the group's demands. This was later confirmed when the body of 29-year-old Shim Seong-min was found in the village of Arzoo (50 miles from where the kidnapping took place). * On 31 July, the deadline was extended to 1 August at 07:30 UTC. * On 1 August, South Korean officials meet with SCG International Risk Kidnap / Ransom consultants at the South Korean Embassy in Washington DC. * On 1 August and at 12:00 UTC, another deadline passed, while the local governor said the Taliban militants have agreed to a face-to-face meeting requested by South Korea's ambassador\\". North Korea also called for the release of the hostages. * On 2 August at 12:00 UTC, South Korean hostage negotiators agreed to direct talks with Taliban kidnappers in Afghanistan. * On 10 August and at 16:00 UTC, the Taliban began the first round of face-to- face talks with a South Korean team concerning the hostages. The talks were held in an area under the control of the Afghan government in Ghazni province. Two top Taliban leaders and four South Korean officials met at the office of the Afghan Red Crescent in Ghazni, along with four members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). * On 13 August two female hostages were released as a goodwill gesture. The Taliban had originally decided to free Lee Ji-yeong, but she allowed another hostage to take her place. * On 18 August, the Taliban announced that the face-to-face talks with the South Koreans had failed and that they were considering the fate of the remaining hostages. * On 28 August, a breakthrough in the negotiations was announced with the Taliban agreeing to release the remaining hostages on the condition that South Korea withdraw its two-hundred non-combat troops within the year and suspend missionary work in Afghanistan. Indonesia was a neutral Muslim party in these negotiations. * On 29 August, a total of twelve hostages were released. * On 30 August, the remaining seven hostages were released, bringing an end to the crisis. * On 1 September, South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun called Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to thank them for their help in getting the hostages released. Karzai praised the negotiation of the South Korean government. * In December 2009, the South Korean defence ministry announced the army would return to Afghanistan with 350 troops in 2010 to protect South Korean civilian engineers working on reconstruction. These troops would not engage in any fighting except to protect the aid team and be backed by helicopters, armoured vehicles and an unmanned reconnaissance drone to protect the 100 civilian engineers and 40 police. The South Korean contingent would be based in Parwan province, just north of Kabul for 30 months from 1 July 2010. List of hostages {  - ! Romanized name ! Name in Hangul ! Name in Hanja ! Gender !

Hunter's 2008 presidential campaign began when fourteen-term Congressman and Vietnam War veteran Duncan L. Hunter of California announced his intentions to run for the 2008 Republican nomination for President of the United States in January 2007. In the campaign, Hunter emphasized his conservative credentials, focusing on the issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of Republican candidates, consistently receiving three percent or less support among Republicans in national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll. Though he qualified for one National Convention delegate at the Wyoming caucuses, Hunter dropped out of the race in January 2008, following a poor turnout in the Nevada caucuses.  Background  Official Congressional photo of Hunter. Hunter served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. He was awarded a Bronze Star, an Air Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal for his efforts on the battlefield., p. 100. Upon his return home, Hunter pursued a career in law and was admitted to the bar in 1976. Four years later, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in the Reagan Revolution. At the onset of the 2008 campaign, Hunter had served in Congress since 1981; representing California's 42nd (1981‚Äì83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for the construction of an additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of the House in the 2006 mid-term election.  Announcement  On October 30, 2006, before a crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter announced the formation of an exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, \\"[t]his is going to be a long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some rough and tumble, but I think it's the right thing to do for our country.\\" He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a \\"surprise.\\" Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find \\"something to do\\" in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and \\"no following within the party\\", Hunter \\"faces extremely long odds\\". After the announcement, Hunter received the endorsement of retired Air Force Brigadier General Chuck Yeager. He won the January 13, 2007 Maricopa County, Arizona straw poll, edging all three projected top tier candidates including Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Ten days later, Hunter filed papers with the Federal Elections Commission to officially begin his presidential campaign.  Campaign developments   First half of 2007  In order to build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter finished a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, \\"a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support.\\" The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided \\"a huge boost.\\" He added, \\"[i]t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. We do have the conservative message that is true. In the end, that will be what Americans want.\\" Border fence along the border near San Diego. Hunter participated in all televised Republican Party (GOP) debates until January 5, 2008; noted for his role in the May 15 South Carolina debate where he discussed his experience with border security. \\"I built the border fence in San Diego\\", he claimed, arguing it contributed to reductions in the smuggling of narcotics by 90% and a 50% drop in crime. Speaking of the bill Congress passed to build of border fence across the Southwest, he noted that as of that moment (May 15, 2007), only two miles of the fence had been built. He quipped \\"this [Bush] administration has a case of the slows on border enforcement.\\" The next month, Hunter participated in the third GOP debate, featured on CNN. During the forum, he discussed his experience as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and voiced his support for the War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he \\"would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [to end development] if there was no other way to preempt...\\" After discussing foreign policy, Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking \\"if they (illegal immigrants) get across my fence [in San Diego], we sign them up for the Olympics immediately.\\" At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the \\"Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party.\\"  Second half of 2007  A Gallup poll from early July 2007 showed Hunter with three percent support, placing the campaign behind only Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mitt Romney, and John McCain. In addition, Hunter won the backing of political commentator Ann Coulter. Hunter described Coulter as \\"a particularly articulate spokeswoman for the conservative view.\\" In late August 2007, Hunter's campaign communication's director, Roy Tyler commented that the chances of Hunter winning the nomination were the same as \\"pushing a string through a maze.\\" This came as Hunter spoke to students at the Brown-Lupton Student Center about two foci of his campaign: border security and fair trade with China. He continued campaigning after hearing of the statement and won the Texas Straw Poll a few days later with Tyler at his side. Duncan L. Hunter greets the delegation at the Texas Republican Straw Poll at the Fort Worth Convention Center September 1, 2007, and is applauded by Texas GOP Chairman Tina Benkiser. After his victory in the Straw poll, Hunter received media attention for his response to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's invitation to speak to students at Columbia University. He criticized the school for its decision, stating that \\"if the left-wing leaders of academia will not support our troops, they, in the very least, should not support our adversaries...\\" He then called for a revocation of federal funding to the University. These statements resulted in criticism from liberals such as Glenn Greenwald, who described Hunter's proposal as \\"dangerous\\", \\"improper\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\". Later in the month, Hunter's campaign website was hacked by anti-war activists. For a few hours, the words, \\"hacked by Adnali f0r TurkStorm [dot] org No War!\\" above images of children in a warzone were posted to Hunter's site. Turkstorm.org, cited in the hacking, appeared to have no connection as IP analysis identified the hackers location in Germany. Roy Tyler revealed that hackers had attempted to change the website at least six times, but this was the first successful alteration. At the October 21 Florida GOP Debate, after expressing that questioner Carl Cameron was trying to divide the Republican Party, Hunter raised an issue he thought might bring the participants together. He reminisced of the time, he felt the \\"Democrat Party [sic] lost its identity\\". He compared the Kennedy administration's failed Bay of Pigs Invasion with President Ronald Reagan's actions in El Salvador. He described Reagan's El Salvador policy as successful in advancing freedom, and noted that as he spoke, the military of El Salvador was \\"fighting side by side with our guys (The United States military) in Iraq.\\" He then referred to the Republican Party as \\"the Party of Freedom.\\" The California wildfires of October 2007 burn in Hunter's congressional district seen in this satellite NASA photo Following the debate, Hunter learned that parts of his congressional district were burning as a result of the California wildfires of October 2007. He immediately stalled campaigning for a short period to help his constituents with the recovery effort. Hunter criticized those who connected the wildfires to the lack of resources because of the War in Iraq. He argued those conclusions were invalid because of San Diego's direct access to troops, helicopters and equipment. During an update with Neil Cavuto, Hunter remarked that those critics \\"have got to have some creative writers to somehow link these...\\" In November 8, Hunter received the endorsement of the Missouri Republican Assembly (MRA). The assembly cited Hunter as a \\"true Republican\\" who shared their views. Two days later, on Veterans Day, Hunter and his campaign released a statement reflecting on Veterans: San Diego selected Hunter as grand marshal for the city's Veterans Day parade. He considered this selection as an honor. Hunter participated in the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, received a question about the military's \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. The questioner, former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked \\"...why you [Republican candidates] think that American men and women in uniform are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?\\" Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was \\"unit cohesion,\\" mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: \\"Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the \\"plant\\", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter.\\" The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter. In the December 8 American Research Group survey, excluding undecided voters, Hunter was statistically tied with Fred Thompson for fourth place in Nevada. In Michigan, Hunter was tied with Thompson and Ron Paul for fifth place at four percent, according to a WXYZ-TV poll. Los Angeles Times columnist Don Frederick pointed out that Hunter's support in the polls came almost entirely from Republican men, where he garnered 6% among that demographic in the publication's poll from December 2007. Among women, his support was nearly zero. Hunter received the endorsement of former U.S. Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire on December 21. In a letter to New Hampshire Republicans ahead of the first-in-nation New Hampshire Primary, Smith cited Hunter as the best candidate to carry the \\"Reagan Torch\\" and the most qualified candidate to protect conservative values.  Primary and caucus results 2008  Hunter finished seventh in the January 3, 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses receiving only 0.5 percent (515 of the 100,593 votes cast) and no delegates. ABC News subsequently denied him an invitation to the January 5 Debate, because Hunter did not meet the five percent polling threshold necessary for participation. However, Hunter focused only minimally on Iowa, putting more resources into the first primary state of New Hampshire. Unlike the other GOP candidates, Hunter traveled to Wyoming for the January 5, 2008 Wyoming Republican County Conventions. The mainstream media largely ignored the event, and Hunter had campaigned in the state more than any other candidate. Hunter won one national delegate and one alternate delegate after finishing in third place in the caucus behind winner Mitt Romney and second place Fred Thompson. That same day, Hunter addressed the Nevada Republican Assembly at their Presidential Endorsing Convention. He won their endorsement after receiving a two-thirds majority of all votes cast the next day. Members of the assembly cited Hunter as their choice for president \\"for his stand on...the sanctity of life, support of [the] constitution, 2nd Amendment rights, security of [the] borders, limited government...\\" among other aspects of his campaign platform. At the first in the nation New Hampshire primary on January 8, Hunter finished in seventh place with only one percent of the vote. Withdrawal After finishing in last place in the Michigan Republican primary (receiving one percent), the Nevada Republican caucuses (two percent), and the South Carolina Republican primary (zero), Hunter dropped out of the race on January 19, 2008. In his withdrawal speech, delivered from the same Naval Base San Diego pier, where he announced his campaign in October 2006, Hunter thanked his supporters, expressed the amusement he and his family had had on the campaign trail and the influence he had on the debate within the party: Four days later, Hunter endorsed former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for the Republican nomination. Late Show with David Letterman poked fun at Hunter's relative obscurity by making a mock statement regarding his withdrawal, saying \\"we don't know what he actually looks like\\" and substituting Hunter's picture with that of character actor Ben Gazzara.Late Show with David Letterman. 2008-01-21.

The school operated as a high school between 1973 and 2015 as part of Worthing's three-tier provision. From September 2015 the school became a standard secondary for 11 ‚Äì 16-year-olds. The school converted to academy status on 1 April 2014. History This senior school is the product of a merger in 1973 of two neighbouring schools, with their playing fields divided by a single white line: Worthing County Secondary School for Girls (Rodmell Road site) and Worthing Technical High School (Boulevard site). The County Secondary School for Girls moved to the new brick-built Rodmell Road building in 1953 from the Sussex Road school with Miss Lilian Belchamber continuing as the head mistress until the creation of Durrington High School in 1973. The Technical High moved to the Boulevard location in 1955 from Union Place Worthing and was renamed Worthing Technical High School (strictly speaking, it was renamed 'The Technical High School, Worthing' as it was a West Sussex institution rather than a Worthing one, and had a catchment area covering the whole of the West Sussex coastal area). The school building has been rebuilt and extended considerably with the Technical High building demolished some years ago and sections of the Rodmell Road building still standing and extended. Durrington High School continues to have the seahorse as their school crest which was the emblem of the County Secondary school.{{cndate=June 2020} In 2015, education provision in Worthing was reorganised into the standard two-tier provision, with Durrington increasing its roll by extending to take pupils in Year 7 who had previous attended the local middle schools.  Campus  The school shares a campus with Oak Grove College Special School. The building is purpose-built, offering facilities for all subjects, including science labs, technology suites and a music department. There is also a large field in which cricket pitches and goal posts are set up, and a MUGA (Multi Use Games Arena) for 6 a-side leagues etc. In addition a large Astro turf was built in 2015 the size of a full hockey pitch with 2 hockey goals and 4 goal posts that are rented out.In these constructions a new pavilion was built with a small canteen for year 7 and 8 pupils and 2 new changing rooms. In 2020 the school is currently undergoing new building work for a new sports hall as well as a update to the MUGA. Theatre and Performing Arts Durrington High School was represented in the West End with pupils performing in the production of \\"Fire Costs\\" at the Lyric Theatre, London, October 1993 ‚Äì a performance that was produced by the Home Office. The production was originally presented at the Connaught Theatre, Worthing in the Autumn of 1991 and was the result of a competition run by West Sussex Fire Brigade in which local schoolchildren were encouraged to submit stories based on the subject of fire. During the course of the 1994/5 re- build, two high-quality Shakespearian productions were presented at the Barn Theatre, Field Place ‚Äì including an open air Summer production of \\"The Tempest\\" and the pre-Christmas production of \\"Macbeth\\". The newly opened school included a purpose built drama studio, amphitheatre and overhaul of the existing Rodmell Hall stage. The exterior of the new drama studio (reminiscent of a mini version of Chichester's Minerva Theatre) includes stone heads representing Shakespearean characters that were designed by pupils who appeared in many of the productions during the 1994/5 school year.  Companies  Durrington High School pupils are divided into seven companies: Roddick, Shelley, Franklin, Mercator, Coubertin, Da Vinci and Hawking. All of these are named after famous people devoted to a certain subject or subjects, e.g. Franklin: Science and Music. The purpose of the companies is to allow the younger and older students to bond together. The weekly company assembles include pupils from all years; replacing the traditional year group meetings, although sometimes there are year group meetings.

It is found in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and its natural habitats include mangrove forest, dry forest, swamp forest, and secondary forest. The plumage varies among the subspecies, with different amounts of barring on the underparts. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the species as one of least- concern. Taxonomy The bar-bellied cuckooshrike was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Corvus striatus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. Buffon believed that his specimen had come from New Guinea but the species does not occur there; the type locality has been designated as the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The bar-bellied cuckooshrike is now placed in the genus Coracina that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The generic name Coracina is from the Ancient Greek meaning \\"little raven\\", a diminutive of meaning \\"raven\\". The specific epithet striata is from the Latin striatus meaning \\"striated\\". It was variously placed in the genera Graucalus and Artamides until Coracina was widely accepted around the early 1940s. The IOC World Bird List recognises fourteen extant subspecies: Coracina striata sumatrensis, C. s. simalurensis, C. s. babiensis, C. s. kannegieteri, C. s. enganensis, C. s. bungurensis, C. s. vordemani, C. s. difficilis, C. s. striata, C. s. mindorensis, C. s. panayensis, C. s. boholensis, C. s. kochii and C. s. guillemardi. C. s. cebuensis, formerly found on Cebu, is extinct. The Andaman cuckooshrike (Coracina dobsoni) is sometimes considered a subspecies. The Handbook of the Birds of the World considers panayensis to be a separate species. Description The bar-bellied cuckooshrike is long. The plumage and size are variable. In the Philippines, the subspecies guillemardi and mindorensis are uniformly grey, with some black on the male's head; in striata, cebuensis, and difficilis, the male has faint barring on the rump, and the female's belly is barred black and white; in panayensis, the male also has black and white bars on the belly, and the female has additional barred patches on the breast; in kochii, the male's breast is also barred, and the female's underparts are entirely barred. In C. s. sumatrensis of the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, the male has grey upperparts with some barring on the rump and lower- tail coverts, and the female's underparts are barred up to the lower breast. The juvenile bird has grey upperparts and entirely barred underparts in panayensis and kochii; in sumatrensis, the juvenile has brown, white and black upperparts, and the underparts are white with black bars. Distribution and habitat This cuckooshrike is found in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines, and many small islands in the area, such as the Kangean Islands and Natuna Islands. It became locally extinct in Singapore around the late 1960s. It lives at low elevations, its habitats being back- mangrove forest, dry forest, freshwater swamp forest, secondary forest, and sometimes scrubs and plantations. Behaviour This cuckooshrike usually lives in small groups or in mixed-species foraging flocks with other cuckooshrikes. It mainly eats insects, including caterpillars, mantids, and dragonflies, and also feeds on figs. Vocalisations include a harsh ', a whistling ', ', ' and a whinnying '. Breeding has been reported in April and May. The cup nest is built on the fork of a tree and is made of mosses, lichens, leaves, rootlets, and possibly mud. The eggs are grey, marked lavender, and reddish brown. Status This species has a large range. Its global population appears to be decreasing because of habitat destruction, but not rapidly, so the IUCN Red List has assessed it as a least-concern species. In the Thai-Malay Peninsula, it is considered to be vulnerable.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task, she was awarded eight battle stars during World War II, and one campaign star during the Vietnam War for her bravery in combat areas. Marias, built under Maritime Commission contract by Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland, was launched 21 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Williams; and acquired and commissioned 12 February 1944, Comdr. Jens G. Olsen in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Marias completed her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay 8 March and ten days later was underway to Aruba, Netherlands West Indies. She loaded fuel oil and proceeded on to the Pacific. By 18 April she was anchored in Majuro Atoll, where she remained for six weeks, fueling the ships participating in strikes against the Marianas and the Carolines.  Supporting the Saipan invasion  On 3 June, the tanker sailed to Eniwetok to refuel fighting ships. Returning to Majuro on the 12th, she loaded for the upcoming Saipan assault, On the fueling station by the 21st, she remained through 3 July, servicing the ships covering the Saipan operation, including those returning from victory in the carrier Battle of the Philippine Sea.  Supporting Guam and Tinian invasions  After replenishing at Eniwetok, she sailed back to the Marianas to support the invasions of Guam and Tinian. On 20 August she proceeded from Eniwetok in convoy to Manus, to refuel ships moving against the Japanese in the Philippines, Volcano, Bonin, and Palau Islands. In mid October, she began to operate in support of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, providing the fuel for their strikes on the Visayan Islands and the ensuing Battle for Leyte Gulf.  Supporting the invasion of the Philippines  At the end of October, Marias commenced operations at her new base, Ulithi. Two weeks later, as the campaign in the Philippines moved north, Marias loaded her tanks and sailed for those islands to fuel the ships conducting strikes on Luzon. During the next 2¬Ω months she remained in Philippine waters refueling, returning periodically to Ulithi for replenishment.  Supporting Iwo Jima operations  Marias next fueled the ships of the U.S. 5th Fleet as they bombarded Iwo Jima and conducted raids on the Japanese homeland. On 24 February 1945, five days after the landings at Iwo Jima, the tanker returned to Ulithi to prepare for the Okinawa campaign. She arrived at the fueling area off Okinawa 16 March for the pre-invasion air and sea bombardment. For the next three months she serviced the ships engaged in the bitterly fought operation making fast run to Ulithi for replenishment. On 3 July the veteran tanker departed Ulithi for her last wartime operation. Nine days later she took up station in the fueling area east of Honsh≈´ fueling the fleet as it struck at the enemy's home islands delivering the final blows of the war.  End-of-war activity  Following the signing of the surrender terms, Marias entered Tokyo Bay, remaining there, with the exception of a voyage to Ulithi for fuel, until departing for the United States 27 October 1945.  Return to Stateside for upkeep  Marias arrived San Pedro, California, 10 November, underwent yard overhaul and departed again for the western Pacific 5 February 1946. There she supported American occupational forces in the Far East until June 1947. During this period she served as a station tanker for two month periods at Taku, Hong Kong, and Shanghai and, operating out of Yokosuka, Japan, made five runs to the Persian Gulf in addition to regular fueling assignments. On 1 June, Marias sailed for San Pedro, California, for another overhaul, followed by two round the world cruises, completing the second in April 1948. For the next four years, with one interruption - a cruise to Bahrein, 27 July to 9 October 1950 - the ship delivered fuel from the U.S. West Coast to Pearl Harbor and Alaskan ports.  Middle East operations  Marias refueling in 1966. On 19 November 1952, Marias departed San Francisco, California, for her first deployment with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. The following years brought further six month deployments as a \\"white oiler\\", a supplier of aircraft fuel to the oilers that serviced the fleet. On 9 May 1955, she was assigned indefinitely to the Mediterranean, home ported at Barcelona, Spain, and for the ensuing years operated as part of Service Force, 6th Fleet. Reassigned to the East Coast in July 1960, Marias was home ported at Norfolk, Virginia, and attached to the U.S. 2nd Fleet as a fleet oiler. She operated primarily with ASW forces in the western Atlantic into 1969 and was periodically deployed to serve the 6th fleet (1962, 1964, 1965, and 1968).  Cuban Crisis operations  Her 1962 deployment was followed by a Caribbean cruise to support the ships enforcing the quarantine policy during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October to November of that year. Other activities during this period included participation in exercises such as \\"Sea Orbit 1964\\"; Operation Steel Pike, the largest peacetime amphibious landing in history (fall 1964); and Operation Springboard (1965 and 1967). These exercises ensured her capability to perform her vital services whenever and wherever called for.  Operating for MSC  USNS Marias refueling USS Independence, c. 1974. She was decommissioned from the Navy and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as USNS Marias (T-AO-57) in 1973. As of the mid-1970s, she served as a fleet oiler in the Red Sea, and in 1976 Marias was refueling ships in the Mediterranean. Her home port during these operations was Mayport, Florida. In the summer of 1976 Marias returned to the U.S. and underwent a thorough hull cleaning and refurbishing in Baltimore, Maryland. After completion of that yard period, she spent the next several months in the North Atlantic, taking part in a large multi-national fleet exercise, refueling ships of various NATO countries during the course of the exercise. During that period of time, Marias was replenished several times, and took part in an experimental replenishment from a commercial tanker. Marias returned to her home port, for the first time in many years, in December 1976.  Fate  Marias was transferred on 22 November 1982 to the James River Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 December 1992 and sold to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 18 September 1995 for scrapping.https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/detail.asp?Ship=3185 Maritime Administration Ship Record Detail: Marias  Awards  Marias received eight battle stars for World War II service.

The act of greening generally involves incorporating more environmentally friendly systems into one's environment, such as the home, work place, and general lifestyle. Facade greening with various supporting climbing plants on climbing aids Greening is also a general term for the appropriate selection and planting of plants on, in, or next to buildings and in public parks. The goal of greening is usually a combination of environmental benefits and improving the visual design of surfaces, for example, a green wall or green roof, as well as the creation of green spaces. This usually requires technical measures such as earthworks or supporting climbing plants. Furthermore, permanent care and irrigation is usually necessary to maintain the greened environment. In some areas there are normative requirements for the planning and execution of the greening, for example roadsides greening. In soil bioengineering, plants with technical functions may be needed. Measures such as the recultivation of heaps, plantations as part of a compensatory measure or, in tiller forestry, the planting of vegetation are distinguished from greening. In professional parlance, the sowing or planting of agricultural crops is also referred to as crop growing or occasionally as field cultivation. The term sowing is used for lawns. The greening of deserts is a particularly difficult task. If it is sustainable, it is the most effective measure for the economic development of arid areas, decreases global warming, and also improves the local climate. The state of Israel in Negev has long been a pioneer in this field. A project between 1991 and 2011 and supported by, among others, the forests of German states provided 450,000 trees for the desert city of Beersheba. Another major reforestation (greening) project is China's Green Wall, which aims to reduce the increasing devastation of entire regions in the north and west of the People's Republic of China. Green qualities These \\"green\\" qualities include, but are not limited to: *reduced toxicity *re-usability *energy efficiency *responsible packaging and labelling *recycled content *intelligent design *responsible manufacturing techniques *reduction of personal environmental hazards *alleviating heat island effect Assessment Environmentally friendly companies such as Green Home have developed a rigorous approval policy that allows consumers to qualify each product based upon these criteria as they apply to specific product categories.

She received 15,991 (2.7%) first preference votes and was not elected. Controversies A car belonging to Healy Eames was seized in Galway city on 2 July 2012 for failure to display a valid car disc. She told the Galway Advertiser: \\"I was using public transport up and down to Dublin and I had neglected the car tax. There is no excuse. I was completely in the wrong\\". Healy Eames was then fined for boarding the Galway- Dublin train without a ticket on 12 July 2012, 10 days after her car was seized. She was convicted and fined ‚Ç¨1,850 for the motor tax offence. In March 2015, she attracted press attention for a tweet in which she claimed that were Ireland to legally recognise same-sex marriage, it could mean an end to the celebration of Mothers Day in the country. As evidence, she claimed that various U.S. states had banned Mothers Day and Fathers Day, referring to it as \\"political correctness gone mad\\". When critics pointed out that her claim regarding U.S. states was untrue, she retracted that statement, commenting that she meant to refer to a number of U.S. schools. In defending her comments, Healy Eames cited as her source Rense.com, a website run by Jeff Rense, a conspiracy theorist known for Holocaust denial, and criticised by the Anti-Defamation League. Critics in the Yes campaign accused her of employing scare tactics ahead of the May 2015 referendum on the issue. In July 2015, during a Seanad debate on a bill to curb online freedom of speech, Healy Eames referred to a \\"wiffycode\\" (meaning a Wi-Fi hotspot password). A clip of this and the accompanying hashtag \\"#wiffycode\\" went viral, and a parody mix was released by radio station Spin 1038. She later stated that she had been using the French pronunciation of Wi-Fi.

It is found in Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the white-throated manakin in his Ornithologie. He used the French name Le manakin √† gorge blanche and the Latin Manacus gutture albo. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the white-throated manakin. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Pipra gutturalis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name gutturalis is Medieval Latin for \\"of the thoat\\". This species is now placed in the genus Corapipo that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854.

Playing career Coordes was born in Weserm√ºnde, Germany. He began his career at Regionalliga North side TuS Bremerhaven 93 but quickly moved to the Bundesliga, playing the rest of his career at just two clubs: SV Werder Bremen and VfB Stuttgart as a defender. Although a rare goalscorer, he managed to score the 10,000th Bundesliga goal when he netted for VfB Stuttgart against Eintracht Frankfurt on 26 January 1974. He played one final season in the 2.

Coaching career Coordes entered coaching with OSC Bremerhaven in the Regionalliga North and worked his way through to the post of assistant coach at FC Bayern Munich by 1984. He stepped up to being head coach at his former club VfB Stuttgart in 1986, but lasted just one season as the team finished a disappointing 12th. He returned to his old post at Bayern Munich, before again trying his hand as head coach of Hamburger SV in March 1992, but again fared poorly and was sacked after just six months. This was the cue for Coordes to try his luck abroad as he moved to the UAE with Al-Nasr before returning to Europe with Austria Vienna. After a year with the Austrian high-flyers, he headed back to his native land with 2. Bundesliga side Hannover 96. Again, he struggled with German management as the club plunged into the Regionalliga for the first time in their history and Coordes was promptly sacked. After a spell back as Bayern Munich assistant coach, he moved to Switzerland for a season with FC Luzern before again heading out to the Middle East as the Iranian under-23 coach and later at Al-Khaleej of the UAE. Following a single season there, he again moved to Austria with amateur side FC Gatt, before again returning to work for Bayern Munich.

He served as the fourth Governor of Papua Province. In 1993, Kaisiepo was posthumously declared a National Hero of Indonesia () for his lifelong efforts to unite West Irian with Indonesia. As the representative of Papua province, he was involved in the Malino Conference, where the formation of the United States of Indonesia was discussed. Biography Kaisiepo was born on the island of Biak on 10 October 1921. He studied at Sekolah Guru Normal at Manokwari. Kaisiepo, and later attended a Civil Administration course at the School of Civil Service in New Guinea. Indonesian nationalism In 1945, Kaisiepo met Sugoro Atmoprasodjo at the School of Civil Service. They quickly found common ground due to their shared support for Indonesian independence. Kaisiepo often held discreet meetings to discuss the annexation of Dutch New Guinea by the Republic of Indonesia. In July 1946, Kaisiepo was the West New Guinean delegate and only Papuan native at the Malino Conference in South Sulawesi. As Speaker, he suggested the territory be called \\"Irian\\", explaining the word means \\"steamy\\" in his native Biak.Chris Lundry, Separatism and State Cohesion in Eastern Indonesia (PhD dissertation), Arizona State University, Phoenix, 2009, p. 166 In the same month, the Freedom Party of Indonesia () was founded by Kaisiepo in Biak, with Lukas Rumkoren as the party's elected leader. In August 1947, Silas Papare led the raising of the Indonesian red and white flag to commemorate Indonesia‚Äôs Independence Day. This action resulted in the arrest of all participants by Dutch police. They were locked up for more than three months. During that time Kaisiepo and Johans Ariks took on Papare's role. Ariks later learned of plans to integrate West Irian as a territory of Indonesia, instead of fostering its autonomy. Kaisiepo was involved in a rebellion in Biak in March 1948, protesting against Dutch rule. In 1949, he rejected an appointment as delegate leader of Dutch New Guinea in the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference, since he felt the Dutch were attempting to dictate to him. Because of his resistance, he was imprisoned from 1954 to 1961. Political career Upon release from prison in the year 1961, he established the Irian Party that strove to unite Netherlands New Guinea with the Republic of Indonesia. To envisage the decolonization of Netherlands New Guinea, President Sukarno made a speech that established the Trikora (Tri Komando Rakyat, \\"People‚Äôs Triple Command\\") on 19 December 1961 in Yogyakarta. The command's goals were: * aborting the formation of the \\"Papua state\\" as created by colonial Dutch powers * raising the Indonesian flag in West Irian, thus affirming Indonesian sovereignty in the area * preparing mobilization to \\"defend the independence and unification of the motherland\\" As a result of this historic address, many chose to enlist in the armed forces, as part of Operation Trikora. Due to the Trikora Action, the Netherlands Government was forced to sign an agreement known as the New York Agreement on 15 August 1962 12:01 hours. The transfer of government administration to UNTEA occurred on 1 October 1962. The transfer of West Irian to Indonesia was conducted by the United Nations the following year on 1 May 1963. Meanwhile, the Indonesian government would be entrusted with developing the region from 1963 to 1969, and at the end of that year the Papuans would have to decide whether or not to join Indonesia or remain autonomous. The first governor of Irian was Elieser Jon Bonay, who held the office for less than a year (1963‚Äì64). In the beginning, Bonay sided with the Indonesians. However, in 1964 he used the Act of Free Choice in Irian Jaya to call for the independence of West Irian as a separate country; this request was forwarded to the United Nations. His action caused him to resign from his post in 1964, when Frans Kaisiepo replaced him as governor. His resignation without a replacement disappointed Bonay and propelled him to join the Free Papua Movement operating in-exile in the Netherlands, becoming one of its prominent figures in the process. Kaisiepo's term as governor of Irian strove to promote Papua as part of Indonesia. This encouraged support within the state for the Act of Free Choice's option of unification, as opposed to full independence, despite huge opposition from most Papuan natives. In 1969, Irian was admitted to Indonesia as Irian Jaya (later Papua) Province. For his efforts in the unification of Papua with Indonesia, he was elected an MP for Papua in the People's Consultative Assembly elections of 1973 and was appointed to the Supreme Advisory Council in 1977 as its representative for Papuan affairs. Kaisiepo died on 10 April 1979. He was interred in the Cendrawasih Heroes Burial Site () in Biak. Family Frans married Anthomina Arwam and had three children. The couple remained together until Arwam's death. On 12 November 1973, he married Maria Magdalena Moorwahyuni from Demak, Central Java. They had one child together. Legacy 10,000 rupiah banknote depicting Frans Kaisiepo Due to his meritorious service, Frans Kaisiepo was awarded the Trikora and the Act of Free Choice Medal of Merit by the Indonesian government. Frans Kaisiepo desired national unity, and worked toward that goal all of his life. He was honored posthumously as a National Hero of Indonesia on the 30th anniversary of the handover of Papua to Indonesia in 1993. He is also the namesake of the local airport serving Biak, known as the Frans Kaisiepo International Airport. Kaisiepo is also among the historical figures chosen to be depicted in the recent 2016 edition of Indonesian rupiah banknotes, particularly the Rp10,000 valued note.

Endemic to Indonesia, it has a fragmented distribution in subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical mangrove forest. It is threatened by habitat destruction and the IUCN has rated it as being \\"near-threatened\\". Description The brown-headed crow grows to a total length of about including a tail. It has the typical glossy purplish-black plumage of many of the crow genus apart from the head and neck which are a dark brownish-black. The tail has a squared-off end. The massive beak is compressed and has a high arch, being black in males and reddish or yellowish-white with a black tip in females and juveniles. The legs are black and the face is well-feathered. The nasal bristles are distinctly parted and the throat feathers are bristly. The call is a harsh caw, either in brief, two-syllable utterances or as longer, drawn-out sounds. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to eastern Indonesia; it has a fragmented range, perhaps because it has some, as yet unknown, specialised habitat requirement. It is present in northern Papua in the lower part of the Mamberamo River Valley and in the Nimbokrang region, near Jayapura. Also on the islands of Waigeo and Gemien in western Papua, and Nimbokrang and the Aru Islands in Maluku province. Its habitat is primarily virgin forest but it also inhabits secondary growth and mangrove areas, but generally avoids open countryside and the coast. Its altitudinal range is up to about . Ecology This crow moves through the canopy either in pairs or alone, or occasionally in a group of a few birds. It feeds on fruit which it gathers from among the foliage. Status C. fuscicapillus is an uncommon species with a limited, fragmented range. Its total area of occupancy is estimated to be about and the total population may be between 15,000 and 30,000 birds. The main threats it faces are habitat destruction through logging and mining, and a planned dam across the Mamberamo River. However some of its range is within protected areas, and in some parts the forest remains untouched.

Initially serialized in Cosmopolitan and published in 1929, it was preceded by Penrod in 1914 and by Penrod and Sam in 1916. The three novels were published together as one volume, Penrod: His Complete Story, in 1931. Plot summary Penrod Jashber is more novelistic in form than the preceding books; rather than each chapter standing as a separate story, the bulk of this book has one story arc, of Penrod's pretending to be detective George B. Jashber. Otherwise it is similar: it is written in the same style and takes place at the same time. Penrod Jashber begins when Penrod's best friend Sam Williams acquires a new pup. The boys squabble about his name, the pup and Penrod's dog Duke rampage through Penrod's house, and as punishment Penrod's parents force him to wear a smelly asafetidaA bag of the pungently sulfurous resin asafetida, worn around the neck, was thought to prevent colds. Tarkington points out that it also kept germ-bearing persons at a distance. bag. Penrod copes with this humiliation by telling tall tales of his exploits to his future girlfriend, lovely Marjorie Jones. Marjorie confesses that the reason she doesn't mind his \\"asafid'ty\\" bag is that her mother has made her wear one too. The detective story arc begins when Penrod further immerses himself in fantasy by penning a hilarious bandit epic starring George B. Jashber, the \\"notted detective.\\" In the first Penrod book, he was hard at work on this picaresque adventure novel, with heroic road agent Harold Ramorez menaced by corrupt police detectives. Over time, he comes to see detectives as more interesting, skews the novel toward the exploits of Jashber, and decides to become one. Imitating his movie heroes, he squints his eyes and talks out of the side of his mouth. He paints an office sign in the (empty) stable and acquires an official-looking badge from the cook's nephew who took a mail-order course. To practice, he shadows his school teacher in the evenings. Now adequately experienced, Penrod enlists Sam and the two Negro boys who live across the alley, Herman and Verman, as assistants. Needing a scoundrel to shadow, Penrod overhears his parents jocularly referring to the polished manners of Penrod's young-adult sister Margaret's boyfriend, Mr. Herbert Hamilton Dade, as being appropriate to a horse thief. The rest of the book concerns the increasingly desperate but futile efforts of Penrod and his gang to prove to themselves that Mr. Dade really does steal horses. Their efforts are supported by Sam's older brother Robert, a rival for Margaret's affections. This support proves embarrassing when the boys' harassment of Mr. Dade finally sends the boys' fantasy world colliding with the dull reality of the adult world. Distressed by the exposure of his fantasy world, Penrod discards the now-alien persona of Jashber and dissolves the agency, and he and the other boys return to their childish occupations.

It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, on the eastern side of the Andes. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest. This is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy This species was first described by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius M√ºller in 1776. Molecular analysis has shown that along with C. pileatus, the grey pileated finch, this species belongs in the Thraupidae, the tanager family. The pair form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the grey-headed tanager. There are three recognised subspecies; C. c. cucullatus from Guyana, Suriname and northeastern Brazil; C. c. fargoi from Peru, Bolivia, western Paraguay and northern Argentina; and C. c. rubescens from Brazil, eastern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. Description The red pileated finch is about long. Both the male and female have a white eye ring. The male has a red crest and a black crown, just as the grey pileated finch does, however its upper parts are dark wine red, with a reddish rump, and the underparts are a drab reddish colour. The red crest and black head are absent in the female and the upper parts are a little more brown than those of the male. The throat of the female is white and the underparts pink. Distribution and habitat This bird has a wide distribution in South America. Its range includes southern Brazil and northern Argentina, extending from Bras√≠lia and Rio de Janeiro southwards to Buenos Aires and westwards to the Andean foothills. Besides this main block, there are several isolated populations in dry mountain valleys in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, another isolated population in northern Brazil and another in Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana. This bird is seldom found above but in the Cusco area of southeastern Peru, it may be found up to about . Status C. cucullatus is generally a common species, and its population trend seems to be steady.

Taxonomy This species was first described by the German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied in 1821. Molecular analysis has shown that C. pileatus and the red pileated finch (C. cucullatus) belong in the tanager family, Thraupidae, and form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the grey-headed tanager. There are three recognised subspecies; C. p. brevicaudus from northern Colombia and northern Venezuela; C. p. rostratus from the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia; and C. p. pileatus from central and eastern Brazil. Description The grey pileated finch grows to a length of around . The male has a white eye ring and a small patch of scarlet on the top of the head which can be raised as a crest, and this is partially concealed by the black plumage on the rest of the crown. The upper parts of the body, wings and tail are grey while the underparts are whitish, grading to grey on the flanks and breast.

The Cabinet Secretary is supported by the Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment, who also reports to the Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy. History In the first Dewar Government, the environment brief was the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Environment and the Deputy Minister for Fisheries and Land Reform, changing to the Minister of the Environment, Sport and Culture and the Deputy Minister for Rural Development from 2000 to 2001. From 2001 and 2007, environment was combined with the rural affairs brief for the Minister for the Environment and Rural Development, with the associated deputy post of Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development. The Salmond government, elected following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, created the junior ministerial post of the Minister for Environment who assisted the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment, in the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department. A junior minister did not attend the Scottish Cabinet unless his/her Cabinet Secretary was absent. The Minister for Environment and Climate Change and Land Reform took the lead role in environment and natural heritage, crofting, forestry, aquaculture, sport fishing, land reform, access, water quality regulation, sustainable development and climate change. In 2010, Climate Change was added to the Environment portfolio becoming Minister for Environment and Climate Change. Land reform was added to the title in November 2014 after Nicola Sturgeon's first reshuffle on her appointment to First Minister of Scotland. The Ministerial post was abolished in May 2016 at the beginning of the second Sturgeon government.

It is found in northern Angola and the western Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is threatened by habitat loss, and its IUCN conservation status is vulnerable. Taxonomy In 1954, Gerd Heinrich collected bird specimens in Angola, and the specimens were shipped to the Chicago Natural History Museum. Three of the specimens were white-headed robin-chats, and in 1955, Austin L. Rand described them as Cossypha heinrichi. The species is monotypic. Description The white-headed robin-chat is long and weighs . The head and neck are white. The entirely white head is unique among the African robins. The mantle, back and scapulars are olive-brown, with the back and scapulars being greyer. The rump is rufous-orange. The central tail feathers are black, and the outer feathers are orange-rufous. The flight feathers and wing coverts are blackish brown, with olive-brown edges. The underwing coverts are grey. The underparts are rufous-chestnut or sienna. The beak is black, and the legs are grey or black. The female has a shorter tail than the male. The juvenile bird's head and breast are buffish-brown, and its back has orange-buff spots. It has browner underparts and brownish-grey legs. Juveniles moulting into first-year plumage have been observed in April and November. Distribution and habitat In northern Angola, the white-headed robin-chat has only been recorded in two areas, including the type locality about north of Calandula. In the western Democratic Republic of the Congo, it has been recorded in Bombo-Lumene Forest Reserve and a few nearby sites. In Angola, the bird occurs in the undergrowth of gallery forests at an elevation of , and it is sometimes found in savannas. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it has been found in isolated patches of thick forest. Behaviour The white-headed robin-chat eats insects, foraging for driver ants on the ground and also catching insects in the air. Its song is repeated whistles that begin quietly and then become much louder. A high-pitched whistle has also been recorded. During observations in 2005, playback of its voice caused a \\"frantic\\" response. It often fans its tail. Its breeding is not well known. In Angola, observations suggest that the breeding season includes February, October and November. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it breeds from September to November. Status The population size is estimated at 6,000 to 15,000 mature individuals and 10,000 to 19,999 total individuals. The population is probably declining because of habitat loss. In Bombo-Lumene Forest Reserve, the species is threatened by deforestation for charcoal. In Angola, forest clearance and slash-and-burn agriculture threaten it. Because of its small range and threatened habitat, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has assessed the species as vulnerable.

Three subspecies are recognised: Cossypha heuglini subrufescens ranging from Gabon to western Angola; C. h. heuglini from the southern parts of Chad and Sudan to eastern Angola, Botswana and northern South Africa; and C. h. intermedia from southern Somalia to northeastern South Africa. Description Photographed at Queen Elizabeth NP, Uganda The white-browed robin-chat is long and weighs . The crown and face are black, and there is a white supercilium over the dark brown eye. The back is olive grey-brown, and the rump is rufous. The two central tail feathers are olive-brown, and the other feathers are orange- rufous. The flight feathers and wing coverts are grey-brown, and the underwing coverts are rufous. The underparts are bright orange-rufous.

Its throat is pale, its breast is pale orange- buff, and its belly is pale orange. Distribution and habitat The range includes Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Its habitats include riverine forest, thickets and also gardens. In East Africa it can be found up to above sea level, but in the part of its range south of the Limpopo River, it generally occurs at elevations below . In South Africa, its range in KwaZulu-Natal expanded south from the 1950s to the 1970s, but damage caused by a tropical cyclone in 1987 may have stopped the expansion. Behaviour and ecology The diet consists of ants, termites, beetles, some other insects and arthropods, frogs and fruits. It bathes in water. Vocalisations The white-browed robin-chat's contact calls include repeated pit-porlee, chiiritter-porlii and da-da-tee and end with da-teee or chickle-ter-tweep. The alarm call is takata-kata-kata. The melodious song, usually given at dawn and dusk, is quiet at first and then becomes louder; it consists of pip-pip-uree, don't-you-do-it or tirrootirree phrases that can be repeated more than ten times. When singing loudly, its beak is wide open and its breast is inflated; its tail moves when each note is sung. Pairs may duet. Breeding Around the Equator, the bird probably breeds in all months of the year, and in East Africa, it breeds during the two wet seasons. In southern Africa, breeding has been recorded from July to May. It is monogamous. There are usually two and sometimes three broods per year. The female builds the nest, which is made of dead leaves, twigs and other plant material and built in a tree hole, stump, sapling, roots, river bank, or on the ground. It has been observed nesting near humans, on occupied buildings' walls and trellises covered with climbing plants. There are two to three eggs in a clutch. The nest is often parasitised by the red-chested cuckoo.This robin-chat is territorial and defends its territory by giving alarm calls and sometimes attacking the intruder. Status C. heuglini has a large range and a stable population trend, so the IUCN Red List has assessed it to be of least concern.

He won seven international caps and scored 111 goals in 444 league games in a 14-year career in the Football League. He began his career with Norwich City in 1947, helping the \\"Canaries\\" to second place in the Third Division South in 1950‚Äì51. He transferred to Birmingham City in 1953, helping the club to the Second Division title in 1954‚Äì55. He scored in the 1956 FA Cup Final, which ended in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Manchester City. In February 1958 he was signed to Port Vale for a ¬£5,000 fee, and helped the \\"Valiants\\" to the Fourth Division title in 1958‚Äì59. He became a player-coach at Vale Park in May 1960, before departing in April 1962. He later played for non-league sides King's Lynn and Lowestoft Town, and worked at Norwich Union Insurance. He entered the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in 2003. Club career Norwich City Kinsey started his career with Treorchy Amateurs and Cardiff City, before joining Norwich City in 1947. Duggie Lochhead's \\"Canaries\\" had to apply for re-election in 1947‚Äì48, after finishing second-from-bottom of the Third Division South. They rose to tenth in 1948‚Äì49, and then he finished as the club's top scorer in 1949‚Äì50 with 17 goals, as the club posted an eleventh-place finish. They reached second place in 1950‚Äì51 under new manager Norman Low, but only champions Nottingham Forest were promoted, who finished six points ahead of Norwich. They dropped to third in 1951‚Äì52, five points behind champions Plymouth Argyle. They then finished fourth in 1952‚Äì53, four points behind champions Bristol Rovers. In total he scored 57 goals in 223 league appearances at Carrow Road. Birmingham City In 1953, the Welsh international signed with Bob Brocklebank's Birmingham City. The \\"Blues\\" finished seventh in the Second Division in 1953‚Äì54, before winning the Second Division title in an extremely tight 1954‚Äì55 campaign under Arthur Turner's stewardship, finishing above third place Rotherham United on goal average. Kinsey scored 17 goals in 40 games of the club's historic 1955‚Äì56 campaign, including a hat-trick against Everton on Boxing Day at St Andrew's. They went on to finish sixth in the First Division, the best finish in the club's history, and also reached the 1956 FA Cup Final at Wembley. He scored a 15th-minute equaliser but Manchester City went on to win 3‚Äì1 despite goalkeeper Bert Trautmann suffering a serious neck injury, leaving Kinsey with a runners-up medal. Birmingham finished 12th in 1956‚Äì57 and 13th in 1957‚Äì58. Kinsey scored a total of 55 goals in 173 league and cup competitions for Birmingham City. Port Vale In February 1958 he was signed to Port Vale for a ¬£5,000 fee, in a move that reunited him with former manager Norman Low. He scored twice past Watford in a 5‚Äì0 win at Vale Park on 8 March, to finish 1957‚Äì58 with two goals in 14 appearances in the last ever season of Third Division South football. He scored three goals in 37 games in 1958‚Äì59, as the \\"Valiants\\" won the inaugural Fourth Division championship. However, he lost his place in September 1959, and scored once in 19 Third Division games in 1959‚Äì60. In May 1960 he signed a player-coach contract, and played just six games in 1960‚Äì61. His contract was cancelled by mutual agreement in April 1962, at which point he moved on to King's Lynn of the Southern Football League. He later became the player-coach to Lowestoft Town in the Eastern Counties League. International career Kinsey won seven caps for Wales between 1951 and 1955. He featured in qualifying for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, playing in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Northern Ireland at the Racecourse Ground on 31 March 1954. Post-retirement and legacy Kinsey ran a pub, before working at Norwich Union Insurance. He was inducted into the 2003 inaugural Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. Kinsey died at the age of 91 in May 2017.

It is found in North and Central America from southern Mexico through Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and Nicaragua to Costa Rica with reports from western Panama. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest. The male is a bright turquoise blue while the female is greyish-brown with pale underparts. Because of its total population size and wide range, this species is not yet considered vulnerable.Cotinga amibalis Birdlife International Description Cotinga amabilis Museum de Gen√®ve The lovely cotinga has an adult length of about . It has a small, rounded head, a plump body and short tail. The male is a brilliant turquoise blue and closely resembles the blue cotinga (Cotinga nattererii). It lacks the black eye-ring of that species, and has a more purple bib and a much larger patch of purple on the breast. The flight feathers are black with broad blue edges. The upper tail-coverts are blue, and are so long that it is difficult to see the black tail feathers. The female also resembles the blue cotinga female; its upper parts are greyish-brown with white scalloping, and its pale underparts are mottled and spotted with grey rather than having the scaly appearance of the female blue cotinga. This species is usually silent, but does sometimes emit fluttering rattles when on the wing. Distribution and habitat This species is found in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Belize. It is a denizen of humid forests and woodland edges, feeding on fruit high in the canopy. Early in the morning, it is often to be seen perched above the canopy on a protruding branch. Status C. amabilis has a very wide range but is a somewhat uncommon species. Partners in Flight has estimated that the total population is in the range of 20,000 to 49,999 mature individuals. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be downwards, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as being of \\"least concern\\" because it is not believed to be declining sufficiently rapidly to warrant placing it in a more threatened category.

It is found in the canopy of the Amazon Rainforest in South America. Because of their bright, beautiful colours, cotingas have been hunted by native peoples for their feathers, as well as for food. The feathers of some species are used in making fishing flies and lures. The beauty of these birds draws birdwatchers from around the world and so may add to the local tourist economy. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the spangled cotinga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Cayenne in French Guiana. He used the French name Le cotinga de Cayenne and the Latin Cotinga Cayanensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the spangled cotinga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Ampelis cayana and cited Brisson's work. This species is now placed in the genus Cotinga that was introduced by Brisson in 1760. The spangled cotinga is monotypic. Description The species is sexually dimorphic with the male being a bright turquoise-blue with a large deep wine-red throat and black to the wings, tail and back. The female is overall dull brownish-gray with darker wings and faint mottling below. Distribution and habitat The spangled cotinga is found throughout the Amazon Basin. It is not considered to be threatened because of its wide distribution.> Behaviour As other members of the genus Cotinga, this species is frugivorous, but it has also been recorded feeding on insects. They are found in the upper canopy of the rainforest. Males often perch in dead trees high above the forest floor. The spangled cotinga and other members of the genus Cotinga do not sing or vocalise although they have been heard making a \\"whistling\\" sound from the wings during flight.

Description Birds are around 20 cm long, and males are a bright blue with a black spotted back. The throat and belly are bright purple with a blue band across the chest. Females are a dull brown with some white mottling. The primaries are modified to produce a slight whir during display. Distribution The majority of the species is concentrated in the state of Bahia, with occasional records from the nearby state of Minas Gerais. It most likely once occurred in Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo, but has likely since been extirpated. Ecology It inhabits the canopy of the lowland Atlantic forest, and has a diet of seeds, berries - especially Byrsonima sericea and Ficuses, fruit, caterpillars, and other insects. It shares its habitat with other endemic birds, such as saffron toucanet and pin-tailed manakin. It's not migratory and its nest is a simple cup. Threats and conservation The greatest threat for the cotinga is deforestation. Continued habitat fragmentation has also complicated matters, sending populations into a sharp decline. Some protected areas, such as the RPPN Esta√ß√£o Veracel and Reserva Serra Bonita, are now thought to serve as bastions for this species.

It occurs on the borders of moist woodland, in the canopy of primary forest and in tall secondary forest. Its altitudinal range is up to about . Ecology The blue cotinga lives high in the canopy. It is mostly a solitary bird, but may sometimes be seen in groups on a fruiting tree; the diet consists of fruit, plucked while hovering briefly. The male often sits in a stationary position on a high perch on an emergent tree, under which conditions his brilliant blue colour may be indiscernible while he is silhouetted against the sky. This bird does not seem to have a song or call, but the male may, while in flight, make a whirring or rattling sound with his wings, perhaps a form of display.

His paintings, critical of the political establishment but always in a satirical fashion, were first seen in the 1980s. His political cartoons appear regularly in daily newspapers in Bangladesh. During the past couple of years, he has produced paintings that appropriate images from Bengali film posters, altered to serve his social and political messages.  Education  Shishir received a Bachelor of Fine Art from the Institute of Fine Art, Dhaka University, Bangladesh, in 1983. He received his Masters in Painting from the Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1987.  Career  Although one of the most influential artist of his generation, Shishir is best known to a mass audience as a political cartoonist for Bangladeshi largest circulation Bengali-language newspaper Prothom AloCloseup Japan: Shishir brings the charm of his cartoons to Japan, The Daily Star, 7 September 2007; Retrieved: 2007-09-114 and an Associate Professor of the Faculty of Fine Arts, Dhaka University, Bangladesh. His style as a political caricaturist has now given birth to a new generation of illustrators who follow his style. He led the influential genre-breaking group of alternative artists \\"Shomoy\\" that appeared in the 1980s, and were considered the \\"third wave\\" of Bangladesh artists. He was a vociferous and early critic of the Ershad military junta, which frequently placed him at odds with the authorities. His scathing critique of the Jamaat e Islami and 1971 war criminals made him a hated figure for the right-wing forces. Shishir is a major influence on politically motivated Bangladeshi artists. In 2002, Bhattacharjee released an album of cartoons.  Exhibitions  Shishir Bhattacharjee presented his first solo exhibition in 1994 in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and his second solo in 2000 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He took part in a group exhibition under the ArtSouthAsia programme in Manchester, England, in 2002. He participated in a group exhibition in Pakistan. A month-long exhibition of Bhattacharjee took place in September 2007 in Japan. He was the only Bangladeshi artist in the 2007 show \\"System Error: War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning\\" at Palazzo Papesse in Siena, co-curated by Bangladeshi artist and writer Naeem Mohaiemen. In March 2008, he had a group Exhibition in New York. In 2008, he had his first Bangladesh solo exhibition in seven years, at Gallery Kaya, one of the newer galleries.

It is found in New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest. Taxonomy The hooded butcherbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in New Guinea by the naturalist Pierre Sonnerat. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Ramphastos cassicus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality was restricted to Vogelkop (Bird's Head Peninsula), northwest New Guinea, by the American biologist Ernst Mayr in 1941. The hooded butcherbird is now placed in the genus Cracticus that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot with the hooded butcherbird as the type species. The generic name is from the Ancient Greek kraktikos meaning \\"noisy\\" or \\"clamorous\\". The specific epithet cassicus is from the French \\"Cassican\\" which in turn is from \\"Cassique\\", the French word for cacique used from orioles. It is one of six (or seven) members of the genus Cracticus known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most closely related to the Tagula butcherbird, and the two are related to the pied butcherbird of Australia. The three form a monophyletic group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the grey butcherbird around five million years ago. Two subspecies are recognised. The nominate race cassicus is found on mainland New Guinea and islands to the west, as well as Kairiru, Mushu and Basilaki Islands. The larger race hercules occurs on the D'entrecasteaux Archipelago and Trobriand Islands. A local name in Ketengban is moro-moro. Description Measuring 32‚Äì35 cm in length, the male and female are similar in appearance. The plumage is predominantly black and white, the bird bearing a black head, nape and throat, white underparts, rump, and back, and black and white mantle. The tail is black, with a broad white tip. The robust pale bluish-grey bill is hooked and tipped black. The iris is black or dark brown, and the legs and feet are dark grey to black. It can be distinguished from the black-backed butcherbird by its black throat. The hooded butcherbird has a complex fluting song, made up of many varied components. Birds may duet with each other, or mimic other species such as the rusty pitohui, little shrikethrush, spangled drongo, or helmeted friarbird. Distribution and habitat Found on New Guinea and surrounding islands, the hooded butcherbird inhabits forested country mainly in lowland areas to elevations of 650 m, or occasionally 1450 m. It is fairly common and may also be found close to human habitation in coconut groves. Behaviour The hooded butcherbird is carnivorous. Birds are found in pairs or small family groups. Records indicate breeding may occur at any time.Coates, p. 369 Located on a branch 8.5‚Äì25 m above ground, the nest is a bowl constructed of twigs and sticks. Two or three pale olive-brown or -green eggs are laid, blotched darker brown and measuring 31.8-35.6 x 23.7-25.6 mm.

It is found in southern New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula. Taxonomy The black-backed butcherbird was first described by Italian explorers and naturalists Tommaso Salvadori and Luigi D'Albertis in 1876. Although its scientific name translates as \\"mental noisy bird\\", the species epithet mentalis refers to its chin not its mind. It is one of six (or seven) members of the genus Cracticus known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most closely related to the grey and silver-backed butcherbirds. The three form a monophyletic group‚Äîthe subgenus Bulestes‚Äîwithin the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the pied butcherbird around five million years ago. An alternate common name is white-throated butcherbird to distinguish it from the pied butcherbird, which has a black throat. Gregory Mathews described the Australian population as a separate subspecies kempi in 1912, citing less white plumage on the nape and tail. However Amadon did not observe this difference. The butcherbirds, Australian magpie and currawongs were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae. Description Like other butcherbirds, the black-backed butcherbird is a stockily built bird with a relatively large head and short wings and legs. It is around 25 cm (10 in) long. Australian birds are smaller than those from New Guinea. Its plumage is predominantly black and white. It has a black head and lores, lower back and wings, with white nape, throat and underparts. The wings feathers are edged with white. The rump and base of tail are grey. The eyes are a dark brown, the legs grey and the bill a pale bluish grey tipped with black, with a prominent hook at the end. The plumage of the juvenile has an untidy brown and white plumage with the same general pattern as the adult, with a darker bill. Distribution and habitat The black- backed butcherbird is found in Cape York Peninsula north of the Palmer River, and in the Trans-Fly region and vicinity of Port Moresby in New Guinea up to altitudes of 600 m (2000 ft). The habitat is savannah and open woodland. Behaviour The black-backed butcherbird has been observed anting. Feeding The black-backed butcherbird is carnivorous, preying on small lizards and birds. Breeding Located in the fork of a tree, the nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. The clutch consists of two to four (most commonly three) eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green, or red. Oval in shape, they are around 27 mm long by 20 mm wide ().

It is found in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and subtropical or tropical mangrove forest. Cairns Centenary Lakes - Australia Evidence was published in a 2013 molecular study which showed that it was the sister taxon to the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen). The ancestor to the two species is thought to have split from the other butcherbirds between 8.3 and 4.2 million years ago, during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, while the two species themselves diverged sometime during the Pliocene (5.8‚Äì3.0 million years ago).  Description  The adult is black all over except for its beak which is black-tipped grey. The juvenile is rufous-brown. As the only butcherbirds with wholly black bodies, they are sometimes confused with crows or currawongs, from which they are distinguished by their gray and hooked bills. Behavior In Papua New Guinea, Black butcherbirds have been observed parasitizing the nests of Hooded monarch birds. In 1903, ornithologist E. M. Cornwall observed brown and black varieties of the bird, the black preferring deeper forest and the brown preferring coastal scrub or mangroves.

It is a common species in the Andes in Ecuador and Peru. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, woodland and scrub. It is distinguished from other species by its distribution, behaviour and white supercilium. There are two recognized subspecies, which are in reality a gradient in morphology and plumage from one extreme to the other. The IUCN Red List conservation status is rated as Least Concern, as the line-cheeked spinetail is common along its range and is presumably stable. However, since it is arboreal, the line-cheeked spinetail is vulnerable to deforestation. Yet, it is relatively tolerant to human disturbance and does well in successional vegetation.  Description  The line-cheeked spinetail is a mid-sized spinetail, weighing 15‚Äì18 g and reaching 14.5 cm long. Like other spinetails in the genus Cranioleuca, it has a long graduated tail and a relatively long bill that curves downward slightly. It has a rufous crown; with a well-defined white supercilium; a pale throat; and some streaking on its ear coverts. It is brown to olive-grey above; with a greyish brown breast and belly; and rufous tail and wings. Although the distribution of the line-cheeked spinetail does not overlap with other Cranioleuca, it may be found in the same areas as the ash-browed spinetail (C. curtata) in montane valleys. However, the ash-browed spinetail has a less visible grey supercilium and tends to forage higher up in the canopy. The line-cheeked spinetail may also be confused with the red-faced spinetail (C. erythrops), especially the juveniles, which have a buff supercilium. The adult red-faced spinetail does not have a supercilium and occurs more on the east slopes of the Andes, whereas line-cheeked spinetails occupy the west slopes.  Taxonomy  There are three subspecies of line-cheeked spinetails: Cranioleuca antisiensis antisiensis in the north and Cranioleuca antisiensis palamblae in the south. They are defined by the differences in plumage and size between the extremes. In general, C. a. antisiensis occurs in Ecuador and C. a. palamblae in Peru. Where the two subspecies meet, there is little phenotypic distinction. The Baron's spinetail (C. a. baroni), with a distribution south of the line-cheeked spinetail, is nearly identical to C. a. palambae where their ranges meet, and has been reclassified as a subspecies in 2018. Without justifiable boundaries, it has been argued that the two species should be treated as one within the line-cheeked spinetail species complex. In addition, they from a larger superspecies with the closely related ash-browed spinetail (C. curtata) and the red-faced spinetail (C. erythrops). The majority of species within the genus Cranioleuca diverged relatively recently in a rapid speciation event beginning approximately 3.5 Ma. It is unclear what drove the divergence, as there is little difference in morphology or behaviour between species. One hypothesis is that a rapid change in plumage, in conjunction with some other traits, may have caused reproductive isolation and speciation. There is evidence that climatic niches have been a driver of speciation within the genus, particularly within the line-cheeked spinetail species complex. Its distribution spans an elevation gradient, as well as different climates, which is reflected in gradual phenotypic differences. Body mass increases from north to south, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. This in turn has an effect on the vocalizations along the range.  Habitat and distribution  The line-cheeked spinetail occupies a clinal distribution along the western slope of the Andes in south-west Ecuador and western Peru. A published observation of a breeding pair in Mashpi Protected Forest suggests that their distribution may extend further north in Ecuador than previously thought. However, more observations would be needed to confirm this. The tree- line along the western slope of the Andes occurs around 3000m, which is also the highest elevation that line-cheeked spinetails occur. In Ecuador, line- cheeked spinetails can occupy elevations as low as 800m, whereas it is limited to 2000m is the more arid regions of its Peru range. Its habitat ranges from semi-humid to humid montane scrub forest and forest edges. However, it prefers habitat less humid than \\"cloud forests\\". Line-cheeked spinetails occur primarily where there is dense evergreen vegetation, and are not found in deciduous and arid habitats.  Behaviour  Line-cheeked spinetails defend relatively small territories as a family group. These groups often consist of 2‚Äì4 adults and 1‚Äì2 juveniles. They are also sometimes seen in mixed flocks.  Vocalizations  Line-cheeked spinetail nest The line-cheeked spinetail is a diurnal species and vocalizes most actively at dawn and dusk to maintain their breeding territory boundaries. It is often seen singing alone in branches near the top of trees. Its calls are a variation of chippering and scolding, including a \\"tsi-chik\\". The song is a series of loud shrills, usually ending in a trill before fading. Both adults and juveniles respond strongly to playback of songs, suggesting aggression between individuals within the species.  Diet  As with other species within the family Furnariidae, line-cheeked spinetails are insectivores, although their exact diet has not yet been studied. They glean primarily near the ground and within shrubs. However, their status as an understory bird is questioned, as they will often move up in the canopy to forage.  Reproduction  Little is known about the courtship of line-cheeked spinetails; however, they are assumed to be socially monogamous. Nests are formed around February and March, and two eggs are laid. Nests are usually large and oval shaped, built at the ends of branches. A nest in north-west Ecuador was described as a domed structure built on the underside of a palm leaf. The exterior was constructed out of moss, cucurbitaceous vine and covered in the hairy seeds of a Bombacaceae, while the interior was built with palm fibres, Lauraceae leaves and lines with epiphyte rootlets. Incubation and parental care have not been described, although fledglings are observed by August.

It ran from Chillicothe, Missouri southeastward through the communities of Sumner and Triplett on its way to Brunswick, Missouri. The of railroad was originally built for the Wabash Railroad and later became part of the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) before the N&W; abandoned it in 1983. The rail line had the following interchanges: * Chillicothe - The Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad, formerly the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, later the Soo Line Railroad, and most recently I&M; Rail Link. * Sumner - The BNSF Railway, formerly the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and later the Burlington Northern. An interchange existed in Brunswick with the Norfolk Southern Railway, formerly the Wabash Railroad and later the Norfolk and Western Railway before the railroad was abandoned between Sumner and Brunswick. History A community economic development authority, Green Hills Rural Development, Inc., bought the in 1985 from Norfolk Southern Railway as part of an economic development strategy. Green Hills leased the rail line to a private contractor before beginning operation of the line through an affiliated non-profit corporation known as CBRM in January 1986. The line was leased to the Wabash and Grand River Railway on April 1, 1990, but returned to the CBRM after this lease terminated on December 1, 1993; the 1993 floods throughout the midwest having caused significant damage to the tracks and impacting W&GR; operations. The CBRM operated the line through the 1990s, seeing a consistent pattern of 10 to 20% traffic growth per year, and helping to develop a industrial park with new industries, creating over 300 new full- time jobs and attracting in excess of $57 million in new private sector investment to the area served by the rail line. The rail line also attracted a regional grain terminal at its southern end. Despite having a book value well in excess of $1.5 million, the line was \\"sold\\" to the city of Chillicothe by Green Hills for $32,500 without the benefit of open public bidding. On December 8, 2006, the Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune reported that the city of Chillicothe had sold the majority of the railroad (approximately ) to Seattle-based Montoff Transportation, LLC for $976,000. The part of the railroad that was sold had been embargoed since 2004. The city still owns the railroad, now known as the Missouri North Central Railroad, to the Chillicothe industrial park and to a location seven miles to the east where future development is planned. In 2008, the Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune reported that the city of Chillicothe bought back the sold portion of the railroad right-of-way from Montoff for $10 and is planning on turning it into a rails- to-trails project. The Mayor of Chillicothe publicly announced in one of his newspaper columns in an area shopper that the city had made a sizeable profit on the sale of the railroad in 2008. The city was subsequently a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a Livingston County farmer at the behest of A & K Railroad Materials of Salt Lake City, Utah. The substance of the lawsuit was that the railroad was worth far more than the city sold it for to Montoff Transportation. A & K Railroad subsequently offered approximately $400,000 more than Montoff had paid for the property, and asked the Court to set aside the sale to Montoff. The lawsuit was later dismissed on a technicality. Today, the part of the railroad that stretched from Brunswick northward through Triplett, Sumner, and a location just east of Chillicothe has been abandoned, in hopes of turning it into a walking trail, while the rest of the railroad is in operation.

The current one, \\"Toreadores who wear the green and gold....\\" was created in 1948 and the music taken from Bizet's famous opera, Carmen, but the words were written by a student. The older version (the music at least) was taken from the Washington State fight song... (\\"Fight, Fight Fight for Monterey High.

History Of The Toreador The Monterey Toreador was created after the influences of the region; for example, the Carmel Padres were named after the Carmel Mission, the Pacific Grove Breakers after the coastal waves, Salinas High School Cowboys after cowboys that worked the ranches of the Salinas Valley, and the Watsonville Wildcats after the wild mountain lions of the Santa Cruz Mountains. With the rich Spanish heritage in the City of Monterey, the Toreador was chosen when the school opened in 1905. The original Mascot \\"Tony the Toreador\\" caricature, served as the face of the school for 80 years. The toreador mascot painted on the Randall Gym was designed by an art student in 1990s. The Varsity teams were called the Toreadores, the Junior Varsity, the Matadores, the Sophomore teams or Lightweight teams of the earlier years, the Picadores, and of course the Principal, the Clown...well, that label was really only used once and it was reserved for the principal serving between 2000-2007. Contrary to popular belief, the singular Toreador doesn't really exist in the bullring, only \\"Toreadores\\" which consist of the matador, picador, and the clown, who diverts the bull away from the matador when he runs into trouble.https://montereyhigh.mpusd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=971997&type;=d&pREC;_ID=1292641#:~:text=Monterey%20High%20School%20was%20founded,the%20Monterey%20Union%20High%20School. El Susurro The Whisper was the original name of the yearbook, which was not a traditional yearbook, but a collection of student poems and pictures. The word whisper was used to reflect the \\"whisper\\" of the student voices in their poems. Keeping with the Spanish tradition, the Whisper was changed to El Susurro.https://montereyhigh.mpusd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=971997&type;=d&pREC;_ID=1292641#:~:text=Monterey%20High%20School%20was%20founded,the%20Monterey%20Union%20High%20School.

Located in Lisbon, the museum was founded in 1893 by the archaeologist Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos. The museum is located in the western wing of the Jeronimos Monastery where the monks had their dormitory. The museum is built in the Neo-Manueline style and was officially opened in 1906. The museum is the result of Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos's efforts to create an archaeological museum dedicated to the history of Portuguese man. With the support of the politician Bernardino Machado, a legal decree for the creation of a National Ethnographic Museum was established on 20 December 1893. The museum is the most important centre for archaeological research in Portugal. The museum has received the international Genio Protector da Colonia Augusta Emerita prize, awarded by the Foundation for Roman Studies and the Friends of the National Museum of Roman Art in M√©rida, Spain. Collection The museum's archive consists of Leite de Vasocnelos's initial collection and others: either donated to the state, incorporated from other museums or the result of the extensive archaeological explorations carried out by the museum and its staff. The museum's archive boasts items from over 3,200 archaeological sites and covers over 500,000 years of the Iberian Peninsula's history. It has the biggest collection of Roman mosaics in Portugal and an important collection of Portuguese and African ethnography. The museum's archive is available for consultation via MatrizNet.Female bust (288x288px  Main collection  The main nucleus of the collection consists of ancient jewelry kept in the Treasures exhibition room, it is one of the most important collections of its kind in the Iberian Peninsula. Of equal importance are the museum's collections of epigraphy, of which the collection from the Sanctuary of S. Miguel da Mota (from the Endovelicus period) is of particular importance, as are its Roman mosaics, a few of which are National Treasures of Portugal.  Metal artifacts  The museum's metalwork collection is representative of the mineral and metallurgical history of the Iberian Peninsula, which includes tools created in copper from the Chalcolithic period (middle of the 3rd century BC). Also in its collection are the oldest iron tools found in Portugal found in tombs located in the Alentejo region dating to the first Iron Age (7th‚Äì6th century BC). Of particular importance are a group of artefacts named the \\"Atlantic bronzes\\" and farming tools from the Roman Period.Torc, Second Iron Age, Castro Culture, northeastern Iberian Peninsula  Sculpture  The museum also has the largest collection of Classical sculpture in Portugal. From this period, items of particular technical and stylistic value are the toga-draped statues from Mertola, Apollo from the Herdade do √Ålamo (Alcoutim) and the sarcophagi from Tr√≥ia and Castanheira do Ribatejo. Of note is the collection found in the Sanctuary of S. Miguel da Mota, which is the largest collection of its kind sculpted in Vila Vi√ßosa / Estremoz type marble. The latter collection was found extensively vandalised; this is presumed to be the result of iconoclasm carried out by early Christian communities. Emblematic of the Celtic period in North-eastern Portugal are the monumental granite statues representing princes or noblepeople, often referred to as the \\"Gallecian Warriors\\" which guard the museum's entrance. The museum has the largest and most significant collection of Gallecian sculpture in the Iberian Peninsula. Also in this collection are the \\"Verraco\\" zoomorphic sculptures, probably created for totemic purposes.A statue of a Gallaecian warrior, two of which mark the entrance to the museum, Castro Culture, 1st century AD  Roman mosaics  Even though many Roman mosaics have been found in Portugal, this collection cannot be considered of international importance, especially when compared to collections in neighbouring Spain and Northern Africa. Nevertheless, within this collection, the most important items are mosaics from the Roman Villas of Torre da Palma, Santa Vit√≥ria do Ameixal, Milreu and Montinho das Laranjeiras. The most common themes found in these mosaics come from classical mythology: the journey of Odysseus, Orpheus and the labours of Hercules. Almost all the mosaics date to the 3rd century BC.  Gold jewelry  The museum's collection, built over more than half a century, has over 1,000 items of gold jewellery dating from pre-history to ancient history. The collection, which had been kept from the public, is now available for all to see, and displayed chrono-culturally. Some of the most important items found in this collection are the treasures of the Herdade do √Ålamo and Bai√£o, the Arrecadas from Pa√ßos de Ferreira on the notable torc of Vilas-Boas.  Epigraphy  Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos was a noted epigraphist, and the museum boasts one of the best national collections of epigraphy. Characterised by three motives, funerary, votive and honorific, the vast majority of the collection is of Latin epigraphy and tombstones. The museum also holds a collection of important early Christian epigraphy. Templates obeying predefined formula were often used for Roman Imperial Latin epigraphy. Inscriptions such as D.M.S. (dis manibus sacrum), H.S.E. (hic situs est) and S.T.T.L. (sit tibi terra levis) leave no doubt as to their funerary nature. The museum also holds a notable collection of votives to an indigenous divinity from the Endovelicus period located in the Sanctuary of S√£o Miguel da Mota. Although in lesser numbers, there are also honorific epigraphs, which, amongst others, include the Civitas Ammaiensis to Emperor Claudius (part of his imperial cult).  Medals and coins  The museum has a small medals collection, its coin collection consists primarily of coins from Portugal's Roman period. There are over 30,000 Roman coins in the museum's archives, which include some of the first coins used in Lusitania. The vast majority of this collection comes from several collections from the Roman Republican period. A significant collection was found in the Santana da Carnota and in M√©rtola. From the late Roman period, a 3rd century AD collection was found in Porto Carro and from the 4th century AD a collection was found in Tr√≥ia.The Muses (panel I), Roman mosaic, 4th century AD  Organic materials  The fragile and difficult nature of preserving organic materials led to the development of special storage facilities in the museum, where such materials could be stored in a controlled environment. In this repository are items such as wooden step ladders and ropes from Roman mines located in Vipasca (Aljustrel), mummified remains and baskets and items made from leather belonging to the Egyptian collection.  Ancient Egypt  The collection of ancient Egyptian art contains over 500 items, of which 300 can be found on display. The collection has several origins; the bulk of the nucleus was purchased by Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos in 1909 during his visit to Egypt, and later the collections of Queen Am√©lie of Orl√©ans and of the Palmela family were added. Despite its relatively small size, this collection covers the history of Egypt from the pre-dynastic to the Coptic eras. 2nd ‚Äì 3rd Century AD  Greco-Roman world  The museum contains holds a diversity of items stemming from the Greco-Roman Mediterranean from the Classical and Pre- Classical period. In this collection are, amongst others, the items collected by Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos in Greece, along with items purchased at auction, including an ancient Panathenaic amphora originating from Pompeii or Herculaneum. Fortuna, 1st century AD, Roman period  Ethnography  Ethnography was central to the museum's original underpinnings. Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos traveled through numerous regions obtaining artifacts that now form the core of the National Museum of Archaeology and the National Museum of Ethnology's collections. Of particular note are the collections of popular religious art, which contain religious iconography, votive offerings, votive panels and amulets; pastoral arts (spoons, horns, gunpowder horns); items with keys; musical instruments (including an 18th century accordion) toys; smoking paraphernalia; Portuguese faience from the 17th to 20th centuries from several factories and periods; and pottery from Barcleos, Gaia, Caldas da Rainha, Mafra, Nisa, Estremoz, Redondo and the Algarve. There are also African artworks. Of particular importance is the Tshokwe sculpture representing the warrior Tshibinda Ilunga.left  Amphorae  The collection of amphora in the National Museum of Archaeology is an important testament of the socio- economic relations between the province of Lusitania and the great economic epicenters of the Roman world. Lusitania spanned the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts and left archaeological remains dating from the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD. The amphorae in the museum's collections are today part of a collective study on the complex maritime trade routes of the Roman Empire. Archaeological sites in M√©rtola, Castro Marim, Torre de Ares and Troia have revealed commercial ties between the eastern and western Mediterranean and the north of Africa through the import of the famous Baetic olive oil and wine, found in amphorae of types Dressel 20, Dressel 14, Haltern 70 and Africana I and II. The many amphorae created in Lusitania, of types Almagro 51 C, Almagro 51 a-b, Lusitana 3, Almagro 50 and Dressel 14, were used to store a range of goods, from fish conserves to luxury products such as scented sauces referred to by classic writers as garum ou o liquamen.  Location  The Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio in the Bel√©m District where the Museum is located The museum is located in Lisbon in Santa Maria de Bel√©m in the Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos, a 19th-century building, which was granted by the government to the museum on 20 November 1900. The museum takes up almost the whole of the part of the Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos that faces the Pra√ßa do Imp√©rio. This is an area of high tourism traffic on account of its multiple museums and heritage sites. Throughout the years, the National Museum of Archaeology has been the subject of multiple reorganizations of its space and collection. The National Museum of Archaeology was originally based in Lisbon's Academy of Sciences in room provided by the Geological Commission. In 1903 it moved to the Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos, and on 22 April 1906 it opened its doors to the public. However, because the museum became the national repository of archaeological finds, its collection grew significantly. To overcome the physical limitations of its facilities, it was suggested in the 1950s that the museum move part of its collection to the Lisbon University campus. It has also been suggested that the museum move to the Cordoaria Nacional.  Mission  The museum was conceived by Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos to be the \\"Museum of Portuguese Man\\", a dream that grew as his archaeological work progressed. Its name has changed over the years, and in 1989 the museum was renamed the National Museum of Archaeology - Dr. Leite de Vasconcelos. The directors that followed supported many archaeological excavations, the finds of which entered the museum. The majority of research carried out, however, has focused primarily on the museum's existing collection. The museum continues today with the same basic mission: to tell the history of people in Portugal's national territory, from their origins to the birth of the nation. The country's main center for archaeological research is located within the museum. Besides research and education, the museum is the national repository and space for exhibitions of an archaeological nature. The museum has published the periodical Portuguese Archaeologist since 1895.  Gifts and donations  The National Museum of Archaeology has, in its short history, benefitted from several important gifts and donations. Of particular importance have been the donations of Ant√≥nio Bustorff Silva, D. Luis Bram√£o and the Samuel Levy family.

Plot Two brothers, David and Peter (Andy Serkis and Reece Shearsmith), kidnap Tracey (Jennifer Ellison), the stepdaughter of Arnie (Steven Berkoff), an underworld crime boss. After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car trunk. As they try to get her upstairs Peter gets sidetracked by her chest not realizing that she has woken up. She headbutts him several times and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew (Steve O'Donnell) delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along. After Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey -- who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic -- has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter. Some distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial-killer known only as the Farmer. After opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape too, all with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter manages to incapacitate the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant. As the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat-hook in the shed. Meanwhile, Andrew and David, discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven (Simon Schatzberger), dying from being disemboweled, before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out. Peter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on, and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope. The Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters defeated \\"You must be joking\\" before they set upon him, the lighter goes out and Peter screams as they attack him. After the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men are seen arriving at the farm. As they step up to the front door, the Farmer suddenly rushes out at them with the pickaxe raised above his head. As he swings at them with it, the image freezes and the screen fades to black.

Life Preston was born at Simpson, Buckinghamshire, in 1537, and was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected scholar, 16 August 1553, and fellow, 18 September 1556. He graduated B.A. in 1557 and M.A. in 1561. When Queen Elizabeth visited Cambridge in August 1564, he attracted the royal favour by his performance of a part in the tragedy of Dido,See further \\"Early English Tragedy: Introduction of intermedii\\" in The Cambridge History of English and American Literature (1907‚Äì1921), vol. 5. and by disputing in philosophy with Thomas Cartwright in the royal presence.Siobhan Keenan in Archer, Goldring, and Knight (eds.), The Progresses, Pageants, and Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I (Oxford 2007), p. 92. He also addressed the queen in a Latin oration on her departure, when she invited him to kiss her hand, and gave him a pension of 20l. a year, with the title of \\"her scholar.\\"John Strype, Annals. He served as proctor in the university in 1565. In 1572 he was directed by the authorities of his college to study civil law, and four years later proceeded to the degree of LL.D. In 1581 he resigned his fellowship. He seems to have joined the College of Advocates. In 1584 he was appointed master of Trinity Hall, and he served as vice-chancellor of the university in 1589‚Äì90. Preston died on 1 June 1598, and was buried in the chapel of Trinity Hall. A monumental brass near the altar, placed there by his wife Alice, bears a Latin inscriptionSee C.H. Cooper and T. Cooper, Athenae Cantabrigienses (1861), vol. II, p. 248. and a full-length effigy of him in the habit of a Cambridge doctor of laws. Works Cambyses Title page of an early edition of Cambyses, showing the division of roles among actors.Preston was a pioneer of the English drama, and published in 1569 A lamentable tragedy mixed ful of plea≈øant mirth,conteyning the life of CAMBISES King of PERCIA, from the beginning of his kingdome vnto his death, his one good deed of execution, after that many wicked deeds and tirannous murders, committed by and through him, and la≈øt of all, his odious death by Gods Ju≈øtice appointed, Doon in ≈øuch order as foloweth. By Thomas Preston. There are two undated editions: one by John Allde, who obtained a license for its publication in 1569, and another by Edward Allde.Cf. John Payne Collier, Registers, Shakespeare Society, i. 205. It was reprinted in Hawkins's Origin of the English Drama (i. 143) and in Dodsley's Old English Drama (ed. Hazlitt, iv. 157 sq.). A reference to the death of Bishop Bonner in September 1569 shows that the piece was produced after that date. The play illustrates the transition from the morality play to historical drama. The dramatis personae include allegorical figures (e.g. Cruelty, Small Ability)See further Karl P. Wentersdorf, \\"The Allegorical Role of the Vice in Preston's Cambises,\\" Modern Language Studies 11:2 (1981), pp. 54‚Äì69. as well as historical personages (such as the title character, Cambyses II of Persia). The plot, characterisation, and language are rugged and uncouth. Murder and bloodshed abound. The play is largely written in rhyming fourteener couplets, with some irregular heroic verse (as in the speeches of the comic character Ambidexter). The bombastic grandiloquence of the piece became proverbial, and Shakespeare is believed to allude to it when he makes Falstaff say \\"I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein\\" (Henry IV, Part 1, ii.4). Preston's authorship Critics objecting to the style of Cambyses have doubted whether the playwright may not have been a different Thomas Preston. M. Channing Linthicum lists some of these possibilities: > Those who dislike to think of Cambyses as even a puerile attempt of the > Latin scholar Thomas Preston, may entertain Chambers' suggestion that it may > have been composed by a popular writer of the same name. He mentions, > (Elizabethan Stage, III, 469), a \\"quarterly waiter at Court\\" under Edward > VI, and a choirmaster at Windsor. A \\"gentleman waiter\\" of this name was > detailed to the service of the Princess of Castile in 1514 (see Letters & > Papers of Henry VIII, I, ii, entry 2656 [6]); a Thomas Preston was rewarded > by Princess Mary Tudor, 1537 (see Madden, Privy Purse Expenses of Princess > Mary, 59); in 1544, Thomas Preston‚Äîpresumably the same person‚Äîwas granted, > as the King's \\"servant\\" a tenement \\"called le Crystofer in St Botulphs > parishe without Aldrychgate\\" (see Letters & Papers of Henry VIII, XIX, i, p. > 644); \\"le messuage called le White Beare\\" was said in 1548, to have been > \\"lately in tenure of Thomas Preston\\" (see Cal. Pat. Rolls, July 25, 1548, m. > 34). None of these‚Äîif they were different persons‚Äîis termed writer or > \\"player,\\" but the references show that the name was not uncommon in London, > and the subject needs to be investigated.M. Channing Linthicum, \\"The Date of > Cambyses,\\" PMLA, Vol. 49, No. 3. (Sep., 1934), pp. 959‚Äì961, p. 960 n. 2 On the other hand, √âmile Legouis has noted, \\"The marked and yet artless bad taste of the style has thrown doubt on the authorship, yet the play shows signs of having been written by a humanist, for Herodotus is followed step by step, and there are many mythological reminiscences.\\"√âmile Legouis, A History of English Literature, vol. 1 (London: Dent, 1926), p. 156. But it has since been argued that the Herodotean account may have been mediated by a chronicle such as Johann Carion's Chronica;Don Cameron Allen, \\"A Source for Cambises,\\" Modern Language Notes 49 (1934), pp. 384‚Äì387. a more recent refinement of this theory suggests that Preston used Richard Taverner's 1539 The Garden of Wysedom, which drew on Carion.Irving Ribner, The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare (2005), p. 52; Google Books. Ballads Preston (or the author of Cambyses) also wrote a broadside ballad entitled A Lamentation from Rome how the Pope doth bewayle the Rebelles in England cannot prevayle. To the tune of \\"Rowe well, ye mariners\\" (London by William Griffith, 1570; reprinted in Collier's Old Ballads, edited for the Percy Society, and in the Borderer's Table Book by Moses Aaron Richardson, vii. 154).Collier, i. 210. This ballad is written \\"in the person of a fly who happens to be lodged in the pope's nose when news comes about the Catholic uprising in the north of England\\" and describes the pope raging and hurling furniture, to the fly's terror.Bruce R. Smith, The Acoustic World of Early Modern England: Attending to the O-Factor (University of Chicago Press, 1999), pp. 189f. Cf. Arundell Esdaile, Autolycus' Pack and Other Light Wares (London: Grafton & Co., 1940), p. 19, where the ballad's first several lines are quoted. Another ballad, titled A Ballad from the Countrie, sent to showe how we should Fast this Lente is extant and dated 1589.E.K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, vol. 3, p. 469. Both the surviving ballads, as well as Cambyses, are subscribed at the end \\"Quod Thomas Preston\\". A third ballad by Preston, not now extant, A geliflower of swete marygolde, wherein the frutes of tyranny you may beholde, was licensed for publication to William Griffith, 1569‚Äì70.Collier, i. 222. Latin works Besides the orations connected to the queen's 1564 Cambridge visit, Preston contributed Latin verses to the university collection on the restitution of Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius (1560), and to Nicholas Carr's Latin translation of seven orations of Demosthenes (London, 1571).

However, the larger scale Surveyor's Draft of the Ordnance Survey does show the mill. Records show that the mill was standing in 1828. Oldland Mill was working by wind until 1912. The mill began to fall into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century and continued to deteriorate. The Sussex Archaeological Society acquired the mill in 1927 and repairs were carried out by E Hole and Sons of Burgess Hill in 1934. In 1976, at the Annual General Meeting of the Hassocks Amenity Association, there was a talk was given on the work of Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The question of how to preserve Oldland Mill was raised. The mill was then in the ownership of the Sussex Archaeological Society. The mill was surveyed in 1977 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Edwin Hole and found to be close to collapse. Following negotiations with the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1979 the Hassocks Amenity Association leased the mill in 1980 and began a period of volunteer- led restoration. Since then the mill has benefited from a DEFRA grant and substantial work has been completed, almost entirely carried out by volunteers. The mill was stripped to her bare essentials and many new parts completely and accurately built from scratch to replace rotten parts. The whole mill has been reclad and as of 18 October 2007 the four sweeps had been lifted into position. The mill ground its first batch of corn for many decades in October 2008, and following detailed commissioning the windmill now grinds flour regularly, being one of the few windmills registered for flour sales in Sussex. It is Sussex's oldest working windmill and today the mill is looked after by the volunteers of Oldland Mill Trust, a registered charity which owns the mill. The original auxiliary drive system was restored and commissioned in 2015 when steam power was used to drive the mill for the first time in over 100 years. Restoration The first working party on 2 August 1980 cleared rubbish around the mill and made a temporary repair to the roof of the roundhouse. In 1981, the two remaining sweeps and stock were removed with the assistance of sailors from HMS Daedalus. In 1983, an \\"A\\" frame was constructed to support the windshaft. The mill was restored over the next ten years, with much of the framing being replaced, including the trestle, crown tree, breast, tail and side frames. A new diameter clasp arm head wheel and brake was constructed in 2006. The head wheel is of elm with hornbeam cogs and oak arms. Description Oldland Mill is a post mill on a single-storey octagonal roundhouse. It has four spring sweeps and is winded by a tailpole. The windshaft is cast iron and was cast by Boaz Medhurst, the Lewes millwright, in 1873. There are two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail.

Toponym \\"Chisel\\" is derived from the old English ceosel or cisel meaning \\"gravel\\" or \\"shingle\\", referring to the river gravel beside the Thame on which some of the village is built. In a document dated 1147 the toponym is spelt Chiselentona. Chislehampton came into use later in the same century and was still in use in 1974. A document dated 1517 calls the village Chessyllyngton. It has been colloquially called Chisleton. Manors and houses The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Chiselhampton by name, but it ascribes a fee of land here to William Fitz-Ansculf of Dudley Castle. For some time thereafter, as Dudley passed to successive families, Chiselhampton remained with the Honour of Dudley. In 1536 the principal manor of Chiselhampton passed to Thomas Doyley of Hambleden in Buckinghamshire. The Doyley family built a substantial house in Chiselhampton, possibly towards the end of the 16th century. Maps of 1628 and 1743 record it as a four-gabled mansion with a large dovecote and an orchard, and an estate plan of 1741‚Äì42 shows the house's west front as having eight bays. Chiselhampton's oldest building is Camoys or Camoise Court, a moated stone-built farmhouse of the 14th century. It was in existence by 1318 when its owner, Sir Richard de Louches of Great Milton, was licensed to crenellate it. The house's name comes from Thomas de Camoys, who acquired it when he married Elizabeth de Louches. Part of the 14th-century building and traces of its moat survive, along with a wing that was added in the 17th century and altered in 1880. At some point the Doyley family, who had bought the main manor in 1748, also acquired the Camoys manor and Camoys Court. Camoys Court is a Grade II* listed building. The Coach and Horses Several cottages and houses with timber frames and brick infill were built in the 17th century and survive today. They include Chiselhampton's only public house, the 17th-century Coach and Horses Inn.The Coach & Horses In the 18th century the Doyley family's wealth declined, so in 1748 Sir Thomas Doyley sold the Chiselhampton and Camoys manors to Charles Peers of Olney, Buckinghamshire. The combined manor was still with the Peers family in 1958. In the 1740s a surveyor for the Doyleys reported that the late-16th-century mansion was \\"a very old inconvenient building part brick, part stone\\" whose outbuildings were ruinous, and concluded that they and the house would \\"scarce pay for pulling down and yet were not good enough to keep up\\". Only the dovecote and the walls of the kitchen garden were fit to retain. The Doyleys seem to have lacked the means to rebuild the house, but in 1766 the new owner Charles Peers had a new house designed. In 1768 it was completed on a new site overlooking the River Thame and the old Doyley mansion was demolished. Peers' Chistleton or Chiselhampton House is a brick Georgian country house of five bays. The exterior is plain but the entrance hall has a fine, curved, cantilevered staircase, galleries at the first and second floors and is lit by a glass umbrella dome. An orangery was added in either 1790 or 1820. In 1820 the house was enhanced with the addition of a number of marble fireplaces and a pilastered entrance porch that the Victoria County History states is Doric but Pevsner and Sherwood state is Ionic. Chiselhampton House is a Grade II* listed building. Chapel and parish church By 1146 Chiselhampton had a chapel dedicated to Saint Mary. It was a peculier of Dorchester Abbey and seems not to have been an independent parish. St Mary's had no graveyard: villagers buried their dead at Stadhampton, which was another of Dorchester Abbey's chapels and peculiers. St Mary's chapel remained under Dorchester Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, when Stadhampton became a parish separate from Dorchester. Chiselhampton seems then to have become a chapelry of Stadhampton. Despite this new status, until about 1835 clergy for both Chiselhampton and Stadhampton were licensed not by the Bishop of Oxford but by the peculier of Dorchester. After the English Reformation Chiselhampton and Stadhampton always shared the same parish clergy. Until 1706 St Mary's chapel was reported to be in a good state of repair, but by 1717 the parish curate had taken the villagers to the peculier court in Dorchester for failing to pay the church rate for the building's upkeep. In 1763 Charles Peers told the court that St Mary's was in \\"so ruinous and decayed a condition that the inhabitants cannot assemble for worship without manifest hazard [to] their lives\\", and so he requested permission to demolish the chapel and build a new one. Inside St Katherine's parish church In 1763 Charles Peers had the Mediaeval chapel demolished and the materials re-used to build a Georgian church on a new site beside the main Oxford - Stadhampton road. That same year it was completed and John Hume, Bishop of Oxford consecrated it. Peers provided the new church with a graveyard to spare villagers from having to bury their dead at Stadhampton. He dispensed with the Norman chapel's dedication to Saint Mary and had the new church dedicated to Saint Katherine. With the new church Chiselhampton was made a parish in its own right, but it continued to share the same parish clergy as Stadhampton. St Katherine's is a neoclassical building whose architect is unknown. It has a bell-turret and clock over the west door. The interior is fitted with box pews, a west gallery on Tuscan columns, a carved altarpiece and a Jacobean pulpit which is presumed to have been re-used from St Mary's chapel. In 1952‚Äì54 the church was restored after an appeal for funds supported by the poet John Betjeman who wrote verses for it and the artist John Piper who repainted the clockface. Concealed electric lighting was installed in the pews in 1956 but St Katherine's is still largely lit by its candle-lit candelabras. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The church has since been made redundant and the ecclesiastical parish reunited with Stadhampton. The civil parishes had already been reunited in 1932. St Katherine's church is vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. Services are still held in St Katherine's three or four times a year, including reenactments of historic Anglican liturgy and west gallery music. Bridge and roads Chiselhampton has long been important as a crossing over the River Thame. A bridge has existed since at least 1398, when a presentment complained that \\"the King's road\\" at \\"Cheselhampton Brygwey\\" was flooded so that \\"men with horses and carts cannot pass thereby\\". In 1444 the villagers of Chiselhampton were granted pontage: the right to levy a toll to maintain the bridge. At that time it had timber spans built on stone piers. A 1628 estate map recorded the bridge as \\"Doyley Bridge\\". Over the years it has been rebuilt with stone arches, altered by successive repairs, extended, and in 1899 widened with steel troughing. It is now long and has eight stone arches, of which the southern four are substantially 16th-century. By the time the English Civil War broke out in August 1642 Chiselhampton was a strongly Puritan community. In November of that year King Charles I withdrew his court to Oxford. Royalist control of the bridges over the River Thame became vital to Oxford's defence, and by March 1643 the Royalists had gated Chiselhampton Bridge and allowed none to cross it \\"but on market days and sometimes during the daytime\\". By June 1643 the bridge was reported too damaged for vehicles to use, but still passable on horseback. On the night of 17 June Prince Rupert led about 1,000 cavalry and 800 infantry from Oxford across the bridge to try to capture the payroll of the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex. The payroll evaded capture, but on the morning of 18 June the Prince overpowered Parliamentarian garrisons at Postcombe and Chinnor. The Prince returned his infantry to Chiselhampton to secure the bridge while his cavalry ambushed a pursuing force in a skirmish at Chalgrove Field, mortally wounding one of the Parliamentarian commanders, Colonel John Hampden. The victorious Prince and his force then returned to Oxford over the bridge bringing 120 prisoners, most of them from Chinnor. After the Civil War the damage to the bridge was repaired. Its west face and parapet are 20th-century, from when the bridge was widened. The bridge is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Historically the Oxford‚ÄìStadhampton main road has been called Oxford Lane where it passes through Chiselhampton. In 1664 John Doyley was licensed to divert part of the road to make room for him to enlarge his mansion. In the village it is joined by a road from Clifton Hampden. This forms part of the route between Abingdon and Stadhampton and historically in Chiselhampton it has been called Abingdon Lane. Both roads are shown on estate maps dated 1628 and 1743. The name of the Coach and Horses public house suggests that the main road may have been a stagecoach route, but there is no evidence that either road was ever a turnpike. Since the early 1920s the main road has been classified B480 and the Clifton Hampden road has been classified B4015. Air crash Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V similar to Z6667, which crashed on Chiselhampton Hill On 5 July 1941 an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V bomber aircraft, Z6667 of No. 10 Operational Training Unit RAF based at Abingdon, was on a night training flight when it broke up over Oxfordshire, crashed on Chiselhampton Hill and caught fire on impact. The crash was variously attributed to either a Luftwaffe night fighter or friendly fire by a local anti-aircraft unit. All six crewmen were killed. The pilot, RAF Flt Sgt AEW Lynch, is buried at Heston in Middlesex. Three of his crew were members of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Two are buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, and the other is buried at Tomnahurich in Inverness-shire. The other two crewmen were members of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.

SANAS is recognised by the South African Government in Act 19 of 2006 as the single National Accreditation Body that gives formal recognition that Laboratories, Certification Bodies, Inspection Bodies, Proficiency Testing Scheme Providers and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) test facilities are competent to carry out specific tasks. SANAS accreditation certificates are a formal recognition that an organisation is competent to perform specific tasks. SANAS is responsible for the accreditation of certification bodies for Quality Management Systems and Environmental Management Systems to ISO/IEC 17021(and the IAF interpretation thereof), laboratories (testing and calibration) to ISO/IEC 17025 and medical laboratories to ISO/IEC 17025 and/or ISO 15189 . Inspection Bodies are accredited to ISO/IEC/17020. GLP facilities are inspected for compliance to OECD GLP principles. Verification laboratories are accredited to SANS 10378. About the South African National Accreditation System On 1 May 2007 it became a public entity with the promulgation of the Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Act (Act 19 of 2006). SANAS has its office on the DTI Campus, Sunnyside, Pretoria, South Africa. It is directed and legally represented by a board of directors whose members are appointed by the Minister of Trade and Industry. SANAS operates in accordance with the requirements, criteria, rules and regulations laid down in the following documents: ‚Äì The Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Act, 2006 (Act 19 of 2006) ‚Äì The requirements of the international standard ISO/IEC 17011:2004, General requirements for bodies providing assessments and accreditation of conformity assessment bodies. The Board delegates to the chief executive officer (CEO) of SANAS the responsibility to implement the SANAS strategic objectives. Approval Committees make recommendation to the CEO concerning the granting and continuation of accreditation and GLP compliance. SANAS Mission Statement To conclude and maintain all international mutual recognition agreements on behalf of its two divisions (certification body accreditation and laboratory/inspection body accreditation), and to pursue international acceptance of all bodies accredited by SANAS. To accredit organisations in accordance with internationally accepted criteria, and to comply itself with the international criteria. To continually review and negotiate methods of reducing the cost of international trade through accreditation. To advise national and international organisations on the conditions for accreditation and issues relating to accreditation. To promote SANAS as the national accreditation body and to encourage the accreditation of laboratories/inspection bodies and certification bodies within the territory. To ensure that there is consistency amongst laboratories/inspection bodies and certification bodies in all activities relating to accreditation and to embrace all appropriate fields of accreditation. To vigorously participate in the activities of international bodies representing the interests of accreditation, particularly the IAF and ILAC. To maintain observer statusuii To work closely with national government to ensure the continued and adequate support for accreditation activities and international acceptance. History of the South African National Accreditation System Accreditation in South Africa dates back to 1980 with the formation of the National Calibration Service (NCS), later the National Laboratory Accreditation Service (NLA). Initially the NCS, which was operated under the auspices of the CSIR, accredited laboratories only in the field of calibration. In 1994 the NLA became an independent Section 21 company in line with international requirements pertaining to autonomy. From 1995 the NLA accredited testing laboratories, assuming responsibility for laboratories previously accredited under a South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) system referred to as SABS 0259. The government through the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had recognised the need to create a single national accreditation system as long ago as 1993, and the establishment of such a system was approved by Cabinet in late 1994. During 1995 the newly independent NLA was contracted to manage the establishment of this system, to be called the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS). During July 1995 a working group was formed to finalise the organisational structure and constitution of SANAS, and the new entity was registered as a Section 21 company in January 1996. The new accreditation body was officially launched in August 1996. After much effort from the new SANAS board, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed with the DTI in December 1997, through which SANAS is now recognised as the single national authority for the accreditation of test and calibration laboratories, inspection bodies, bodies for certification of quality and environmental management systems, product conformity certification bodies. It is also recognised as the national monitoring authority for GLP and GCP compliant facilities. The DTI reserves the right to extend this recognition to encompass other areas of accreditation as and if these arise. SANAS became fully operational during 1998 with two divisions in place, one for accreditation of laboratories/inspection bodies and the other, handling the accreditation of all certification bodies. On 1 May 2007 it became a public entity with the promulgation of the Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Act (Act 19 of 2006). By the end of 2012 SANAS has accredited more than 1400 conformity assessment bodies in South Africa. The key accreditation scopes covered by SANAS‚Äôs accreditation provision responsibilities and their purpose. 1\\\\. Calibration laboratories and proficiency testing schemes Calibration laboratories provide legal metrological traceability in South Africa as stipulated in the Measurements Units and Measurement Standards Act (Act No. 18 of 2006). The laboratories therefore form an integral part of the metrological chain whenever physical measurements are performed, be these for trade, safety, scientific purposes, law enforcement or to ensure that South African manufacturers remain globally competitive. The calibration programme affects the lives of ordinary South Africans, from ensuring that the weight of the sugar, maize meal and flour that is purchased is correct, to ensuring the accuracy of the equipment used for law enforcement, such as evidential breath analysers and speed measuring devices, and ensuring the accuracy and traceability of measurements required within the IPAP priority sectors. Proficiency testing is essential for the demonstration of the competency of a laboratory. 2\\\\. Testing laboratories Testing laboratories play an important role in economies by providing objective evidence that a product or service offering conforms to certain customer requirements or specifications. SANAS-accredited laboratories in the food safety sector play an important role in monitoring the quality of food for import and export purposes, as well as for the health and safety of the public at large. The testing programme also provides an accreditation service in the IPAP priority sectors and other industry sectors, including environmental monitoring, food safety, infrastructure and construction, agriculture and minerals. 3\\\\. Medical laboratories Credibility of medical pathology laboratories is paramount to the health and safety of the patients who rely on the testing services provided by these laboratories. Laboratory tests are an integral part of the workup of any patient, and constitutes up to 80% of a physician‚Äôs diagnosis and treatment choice. It is therefore important that the results are reliable, as medical doctors base their diagnosis on such results. 4A. GLP-compliant facilities SANAS is the official OECD GLP monitoring authority. The main duty of the GLP monitoring authority is to monitor compliance with GLP Principles by conducting laboratory inspections and study audits. The OECD principles of GLP were primarily developed to promote the quality and validity of test data used to determine the safety of chemicals and chemical products. 4B. Forensic laboratories Forensic laboratories are crucial to our criminal justice system as they provide very useful information that aid in the investigation and prosecution of crime through the scientific examination of physical evidence. 4C. Veterinary laboratories and Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-compliant facilities South Africa is no exception when it comes to the problems faced by the livestock industry worldwide. It is therefore important for the country to have a strong and competent veterinary laboratory industry to help with the diagnosis of diseases, especially emerging diseases such as Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE ‚Äì mad cow disease) and to test the safety of meat and other animal products. 4D. Blood transfusion The primary goal of a blood transfusion facility is the transfusion of safe units of blood. Accreditation plays a vital role in ensuring that the personnel involved in all the activities (such as donor registration, blood collection, testing, processing and storage) of a blood transfusion service are competent and that national and/or international standards are being adhered to. 4E. Pharmaceutical The South African pharmaceutical industry is regarded as the largest in Africa, constituting about 33% of all the pharmaceutical sales in Africa. The pharmaceutical or medicine industry is regarded as one of the best areas for business investment. Furthermore, it plays a vital role in fighting numerous diseases that are ravaging our country, such as TB, HIV and AIDS. 5\\\\. Inspection bodies Inspection mainly operates within the regulatory domain where regulators and citizens need to be confident that inspection bodies, especially those inspecting health and safety issues in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act, are competent to do so. This also applies to bodies that are required to ensure the protection of consumers, such as the National Regulator for Compulsory Specification (NRCS) and those required under the IPAP, for example, nuclear inspection and measurement and verification agencies. 6\\\\. Verification laboratories Verification laboratories fall under the domain of legal (trade) metrology, whose sole purpose is to protect consumers from unfair trade practices. These laboratories perform verifications on volume, mass and length measuring instruments in accordance with the requirements of the Trade Metrology Act (Act No. 77 of 1973) and other related technical regulations to ensure reliable results. 7\\\\. Certification bodies Certification is the activity of conformity assessment where the focus is on a system that forms the basic requirements to ensure that an organisation has the necessary self-regulating procedures and controls on factors that affect a product so that it is possible to provide the customer with confidence that the product falls within the specified requirements. Accredited certification bodies certify other organisations with regard to compliance to management systems with recognised standards, such as quality management system, environmental management system. food safety management system requirements, responsible tourism and greenhouse gas validation and verification. This programme, together with the Inspection Body Programme, is the key accreditation implementer for the attainment of the IPAP projects assigned to SANAS. 8\\\\. Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) verification agencies In 2007, SANAS initiated the B-BBEE Verification Accreditation Programme, which supports government‚Äôs national objective to allow for a broader participation of previously disadvantaged people in the mainstream economy. International recognition In support of its national accreditation activities, SANAS is a founding signatory of the multilateral recognition arrangements of both the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and International Accreditation Forum (IAF). These arrangements promote the global acceptance of technical test and calibration data, as well as certificates issued by certification bodies. In this regard, signatories to the ILAC and IAF arrangement are spread over 88 and 59 economies respectively. For South African trade, it implies the elimination of or reduction in the need for retesting or recertification to an importing country that is a signatory to the arrangement. In 2012, the multilateral recognition arrangement (MLRA) for inspection was officially launched under ILAC. SANAS was one of the first signatories to this agreement, allowing international recognition of the inspection results of South Africa‚Äôs accredited facilities. Support for regional integration SANAS plays an important role in SADC by hosting the SADC Accreditation Secretariat and holding the regional coordinator position. The body is further currently assisting the newly established SADC Accreditation Services (SADCAS) by training assessors and partnering with that body. SANAS was also recently elected to host the secretariat for the newly established African Accreditation Cooperation (AFRAC), launched in support of an African technical infrastructure under the African Union.

The game‚Äôs inspiration is from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, with the player taking the role of the horseman War. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on January 5, 2010 in North America, January 7 in Australia, January 8 in Europe, and March 18 in Japan. The Microsoft Windows version was released in North America and Australia on September 23, and in Europe on September 24. A parallel sequel, Darksiders II, was released on August 14, 2012. A remastered version of the game named Darksiders: Warmastered Edition was released on November 22, 2016 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on November 29, 2016 for Microsoft Windows. A Wii U version was released on May 23, 2017, and a Nintendo Switch version was released on April 2, 2019. Gameplay War using a pistol while riding his steed, Ruin. In Darksiders, players control War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in a third-person perspective. The world is split into separate locations with many areas initially inaccessible until later in the game. The center of the world, The Scalding Gallow, functions as a hub where War is given new objectives and paths to unlock new areas, many of which require the use of newly-gained abilities to progress. Although War is initially limited to the use of his two-handed signature sword, Chaos Eater, he eventually obtains other weapons throughout the course of the game. He also has a Scythe, which he uses as his other main offensive weapon. Weapons have different combinations of attack that can be obtained throughout the game. Along with combos, players are encouraged to use countering moves, blocks, and swift dodging. Projectile weapons such as a revolver and a boomerang-style throwing blade can also be used. Objects scattered throughout the environment can also be used as weapons and projectiles. At a later point in the game, War gains the ability to summon a horse that provides faster movement and increased attack power. Along with weapon-based attacks, War can also use an array of magic-based attacks, known as Wrath powers, that are both offensive & defensive in nature. The amount of Wrath powers available are determined through the Wrath meter. War's Chaos Form, which transforms him into a large, fiery and extremely resistant entity can be activated once War's Chaos meter is filled. When enemies are near defeat, War can perform an elaborate and violent finishing move, instantly killing them. Some larger foes can be briefly ridden and steered into other enemies before being finished off. War eventually encounters large boss opponents that are both giant in size and deal heavy damage, and are themselves puzzle-based battles requiring certain methods and certain weapons to defeat them, and in some cases quick time button events to dodge or deal attacks. Upon defeat, some enemies expel souls that provide different benefits. Green souls that fill the health bar, yellow souls that fill the Wrath meter, and blue souls that are the game's form of currency, and can be spent on new combo attacks, enhanced Wrath powers, power- ups, and potions. Also, there are artifacts littered throughout the world that can be exchanged for more blue souls, with bonuses for completing each set. Additionally, souls can be obtained in chests found throughout the world. Other items that can be located include Wrath Core and Lifestone fragments, whereupon collecting four, War's Wrath or Health, respectively, are permanently increased. Plot Story Since the beginning of time, the Kingdoms of Heaven and Hell have warred, with neither side able to gain an advantage over the other. Thus, in time, a mediator group known as the Charred Council arose to maintain order and harmony; to this end, they created a warrior brotherhood, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (War, Death, Strife, and Fury) to intervene and enforce their rules where and when necessary. Amidst the conflict, humans emerged. Foreseeing that humanity would be integral and contribute to the balance's stability, the council declared them a third Kingdom, the Kingdom of Man. The Council then brokered a truce between Heaven and Hell, and the mystical Seven Seals were created to be broken when the Kingdom of Man was prepared for the Endwar. In the present day, War (Liam O'Brien) arrives on Earth where the Endwar appears to have begun; armies of angels and demons wage war with mankind caught in the middle. Confronting Abaddon (Troy Baker), the General of Heaven's army, War discovers that the other Horsemen have not arrived and the Seventh Seal, meant to summon the Four Horsemen, has not been broken. Surprised by War's presence, Abaddon is killed by the Demon Commander Straga (Troy Baker). War battles Straga and gains the upper hand, but he mysteriously loses his powers mid-battle and is nearly killed. He is saved from death by the Charred Council (Fred Tatasciore), who accuse War of destroying the balance by siding with the forces of Hell and bringing about the Apocalypse prematurely, resulting in Mankind's extinction. Protesting his innocence, War demands a chance to find the real culprits. The Council agrees, but he is stripped of his former powers and bound to one of their servants, The Watcher (Mark Hamill), who is permitted to kill him if he strays from his mission. War returns to Earth, where a century has passed since Hell's armies, led by The Destroyer, annihilated humanity and the forces of Heaven. What remains of Heaven's armies have been stranded on Earth and formed into a meager resistance known as the Hellguard, led by Abaddon's lieutenant Uriel (Moon Bloodgood). War is greeted by the demon merchant Vulgrim (Phil LaMarr), who tells him that the Black Tower is The Destroyer's lair, and advises War to find Samael (Vernon Wells), a once powerful Demon Lord, for assistance. Upon meeting Samael, the demon explains that four demons called The Chosen (consisting of the Bat Queen Tiamat, the Griever, the Stygian King, and the Broodmother Silitha) have been chosen to guard the Black Tower, and asks War to kill them and bring him their hearts in exchange for gaining access to the Tower. While doing so, War meets Ulthane (JB Blanc), a skilled blacksmith from a race known as The Makers. Initially fighting each other, they are forced to defend themselves from Uriel and her Hellguard, who believe War responsible for Abaddon's death and their defeat. One by one War brings down all the Chosen, and it is revealed by Silitha that The Chosen were not meant to defend the tower, but to prevent Samael's return. Regardless, War brings Samael their hearts and the revitalized demon lord honors their deal, sending him to the tower, saying they will meet again. Inside the tower, War finds an imprisoned Azrael (Keith Szarabajka), the Angel of Death. As War attempts to free him, Azrael confesses that himself, Abbadon, and Ulthane were the ones who conspired to bring about the Apocalypse early, fearing that delay would risk Heaven's defeat. However, Abaddon's death ruined the plan. Having found the proof he needs, War decides his mission is complete. However, The Watcher decides otherwise, saying that the Destroyer must die for balance to be restored. War obliges, freeing Azrael and once again fighting Straga, the Tower's final guardian. Unlike their previous clash, War emerges victorious. Since Straga and the Tower are one and War is trapped, Azrael saves him as it collapses by directing him to a portal that instead takes him to the Garden of Eden, hidden by Azrael after he led Abaddon to the Tree of Knowledge, which provides gifts of vision. After fighting a dark reflection of himself and heeding Azrael's advice, War visits the Tree of Knowledge to see how to defeat the Destroyer. The Tree gives War a vision: Abaddon was sent to Hell after he died, and was offered a choice by an unknown entity: to serve in Heaven or rule in Hell; knowing that he would be punished by Heaven and the Council anyway, he chooses the latter and becomes the Destroyer, and now guards the unbroken Seventh Seal while planning to lay siege to Heaven. War is also shown Uriel leading the Hellguard against him and being defeated. The Charred Council is shown to have been aware of the conspiracy, but knew the Horsemen would not act without proof. Thus, the Council allowed the Apocalypse to start early and summoned War themselves, knowing he would track down and kill the conspirators to clear his name. Finally, War sees himself being taunted by The Watcher and fatally stabbed in the back with a blade. Azrael deduces the blade is the Armageddon Blade, a weapon capable of slaying the Destroyer, and tasks War to find the shards of the blade and take them to Ulthane to reforge it. Uriel confronts War a second time, challenging him to a death oath that can only be completed when one of them dies. War is victorious but spares her, and reveals the Destroyer's true identity. Grief-stricken and enraged by this knowledge, Uriel leaves to prepare the angels for battle. War collects all of the fragments and returns them to Ulthane, who reforges the Blade. Meanwhile, Uriel and the Hellguard engage the Destroyer, but they are defeated as predicted. In the aftermath, War confronts the Destroyer, who offers him the same choice he was given. War refuses, battles the Destroyer and succeeds in killing him. War retrieves the Seventh Seal, but is subdued by The Watcher, who takes it to prevent him from regaining his full strength, knowing that he will turn against the Council. Uriel intervenes, taking the Armageddon Blade and stabbing War in the back as predicted, fulfilling their earlier oath, and shatters the Seventh Seal. The breaking of the Seal restores War's original power and frees him from the Council's control. The Watcher threatens him with the wrath of Heaven, Hell, and the Council before War slays him. A grateful Uriel absolves War of all responsibility concerning any harm he has done to the angels, but tells him that her duty will likely force them to battle again. Consequently, she warns War that he cannot stand alone against the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the Council, to which War replies that he is not alone as the other three Horsemen are seen descending from the sky toward him. Characters The player character is War, first of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Along with the rest of the Horsemen, War is not aligned to Heaven or Hell but instead serves at the whim of the Charred Council, whose purpose is upholding the balance between the two forces. He maintains a strict code of honor and will battle any obstacle in his way. It is prophesied that War and the other Horsemen will descend upon the Earth once the Apocalypse begins. Throughout the story, War is bound to and accompanied by The Watcher, an emissary charged by the Council to watch over and guide War on his journey. Because of his assigned role, he is constantly skeptical and cynical of War's actions, much to War's annoyance and often anger. He relishes his duty and enjoys needling War and bossing him about simply because he can. War later employs the guidance of Samael, once a mighty and feared demon, now imprisoned, who himself seeks vengeance against the Destroyer, the main antagonist of the story and leader of the victorious forces on Earth. Many other characters become central to the overall plot, recurring at times. Among these is Uriel, leader of Heaven's armies after their first leader, Abaddon, was killed during a major battle; now stranded on Earth, Uriel seeks revenge against those she believes responsible. Another recurring character is Vulgrim, a demon merchant who provides gear and abilities for War in exchange for human souls. Finally there is Ulthane, also known as the Black Hammer, an \\"Old One\\" who at first is hostile towards War, but the two quickly become allies; first after Ulthane aids War in entering the Griever's lair, then providing War with a magical revolver and re-forging the Armageddon Blade for him. Related media Creator Joe Madureira planned a comic book series and a possible film adaptation for the game. Madureira has been reportedly working on the screenplay and may sell the rights to a Hollywood studio. However, the rights belong to THQ Nordic, leaving the status of the project unknown. Reception Critical reception Darksiders has received positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 83/100, the PlayStation 3 version 82/100, and the PC version 83/100. GameZone Dakota Grabowski gave the game an 8/10 on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, saying \\"THQ and Vigil Games did an outstanding job creating an intellectual property that has weight. The voice-acting is top-notch, the combat is exquisite, the replay value is high, and the world they have created is fascinating. Darksiders is a marvelous way to start out 2010.\\" Being overall positive, IGN saw the elements of Darksiders as a combination of three separate game franchises. Devil May Cry, God of War, and The Legend of Zelda games have been used to compare to the style of Darksiders. Sales Darksiders has sold over 1 million units worldwide. Sequels THQ creative director Luis Gigliotti revealed in a 2009 interview with GameAxis that Darksiders would be a franchise. Darksiders II was released in August 2012. War's brother, the Horseman, Death, is the protagonist of Darksiders II. A third entry in the Darksiders series was originally planned by Vigil Games, however, the fate of its franchise was threatened due to financial complications. Its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. The company's assets were sold at an auction, excluding Vigil Games, which was shut down along with the parent company, THQ. On April 22, 2013, Darksiders was purchased by Nordic Games in the final transaction of THQ's assets. On May 2, 2017, a product listing for Darksiders III appeared on Amazon.com. The game was announced the same day by publisher THQ Nordic to be under development by Gunfire Games. The development team largely consists of former Vigil Games employees. The game was revealed to be released on November 27, 2018. The game follows the Horseman, Fury, as its protagonist, and is set during War's 100-year imprisonment.

The term is generally used in Jewish law to refer specifically to the regulations and rituals concerning the emission of semen, whether by nocturnal emission, or by sexual activity. A man is said to be a ba'al keri () (\\"one who has had a seminal emission\\") after he has ejaculated without yet completing the associated ritual cleansing requirements.  Hebrew Bible  The Book of Leviticus contains several laws relating to seminal emission. A man who had experienced an emission of semen would become ritually impure, until the evening came and he had washed himself in water. Any clothes or leather touched by semen also become ritually impure, until they are washed in water and the evening had come. If the man ejaculated semen during sexual intercourse with a woman, the woman would also become ritually impure, until the evening had come and she had washed herself in water. The Book of Deuteronomy says that a soldier who became impure through a mikreh lailah (\\"night occurrence\\") must leave the army camp, immerse, and only return to the camp in the evening. From the word mikreh (◊û◊ß◊®◊î), the rabbis derived the term keri (◊ß◊®◊ô) to refer to an emission of semen. Non-traditional biblical scholars see the Leviticus regulations as having originally derived from taboo against contact with semen, because it was considered to house life itself, and was thus thought of as sacred.Peake's commentary on the Bible  In rabbinic literature  The Talmud adds prohibitions designed to avoid seminal emission outside of sexual intercourse. It was forbidden for a man to touch his penis with his hand, on the basis that the sensation of touch causes keri. The Talmud goes on to address the concern that preventing any contact with the penis would make urination more awkward for males, and makes suggestions in this regard. A man who intentionally caused himself erections was considered worthy of ostracism.Niddah 13b The Talmud also described procedures in case a man emitted semen (permissibly or otherwise). It states that one who experienced an emission of semen is required by the Torah to immerse in water in order to be allowed to consume from a heave offering or sacrifice. It also states that Ezra decreed that one should also immerse in order to be allowed to recite words of Torah, but that Ezra's decree no longer applies nowadays. Later on, the Rishonim debated whether Ezra's decree still applies in regard to prayer. Hai GaonBrought in the commentary of Yonah Gerondi on Berakhot and Chananel ben ChushielBrought in say that a ba'al keri, while he may study Torah, may not pray until he goes to a mikveh. Maimonides says that the decree was cancelled entirely and a ba'al keri may even recite the Shema,Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Kriat Shema 4:8 but that the minhag of Shinar (Mesopotamia) and Sepharad (in his day, a term for the Iberian Peninsula) is that before prayer a ba'al keri should wash himself entirely with water.Hilkhot Tefillah 4:6 The modern halakhic consensus is that a ba'al keri is not required to immerse in the mikveh before praying, reciting Shema, saying Berakhot, and so on.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 88:1 However, some Jews today, including many Hasidic Jews, practice this immersion as a matter of custom.

Some of the first explorers and missionaries in the area included Lewis & Clark, David Thompson and Dr. Spaulding. They used the Columbia River to get through the Cascade Mountains on their way to the Pacific Ocean. In 1843, the Oregon Trail brought the first settlers there.

So in order to get work done, I had to go through this elaborate exercise in denial ‚Äì leaving whole areas of baggage on the other side of the room, compartmentalize feelings... no time to get closure, to work things out... working in a very highly charged and ambivalent environment. So the go insane thing ‚Äì would just be whenever I let my guard down and got back to all the things I hadn‚Äôt dealt with, it was almost like going insane ‚Äì like I always do. Took a long, long time, working in an artificial environment on a personal level. So many things not worked through for a long, long time.\\" ‚Äì Lindsey Buckingham April 16, 2008 Rockline Radio interview ‚ÄúStevie, at some point her persona onstage was latched onto and she was in a sense called away by a larger world and separated on her own from me.‚Äù- Lindsey Buckingham Sound Opinions August 2013 Personnel * Lindsey Buckingham ‚Äì vocals, guitars, keyboards, percussion, Fairlight CMI, LinnDrum * Bryant Simpson ‚Äì bass guitar Other versions At concerts, notably on The Dance, he did an acoustic fingerstyle version of \\"Go Insane\\", which featured just him and a nylon-string guitar.

It is located about 170 km (2 hours) from Muscat and has a population estimated at 55,000 people. Ibra is one of the oldest cities in Oman and was once a centre of trade, religion, education and art. The city acquired its importance as an important meeting point at the base of the Ash Sharqiya. Ibra is home of the Al Harthy, Al Maskary, Al Mughairi and Al Riyami tribes, some of the biggest tribes in Oman, and all of which are very prevalent in Ibra. Sheikh Saif bin Hashil Al-Maskary is one of the most prominent Sheikhs of Ibra. Sheikh Saif bin Hashil Al-Maskary is among the biggest businessmen in Oman, he has invested heavily in improving Ibra and its infrastructure. Sheikh Saif was also a former GCC Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Ibra is his tribal home town. Etymology Historians do not agree on the origins of the name of the city. Some suggest it is derived from the Arabic verb () which means a purification of guilt. History thumb Ibra predates the Prophet Muhammed's calling. The city contains many castles and old mosques. Ibra has become a more modern city since 1970 under the reign of Sultan Qaboos. Improvements include connections to Muscat via a two-lane highway, which has increased tourism. Communications have been improved to include broadband access, and there is now a substantial hospital. Ibra provides three choices of higher education: Ibra College of Technology, Ibra Nursing Institute, and beginning in the fall of 2010, A‚ÄôSharqiyah University. There are now two hotels in Ibra, and tourism is promoted in the area. Geography and climate Ibra has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BWh).

Ibra Souq The city, famous for its handicrafts and agricultural products, has an expansive souq showcasing an array of products. It is one of the most important in the country besides Muttrah.

This optically undetected companion to the late F-type main-sequence star HD 114762 was discovered in 1989 by Latham, et al., and confirmed in an October 1991 paper by Cochran, et al. It was thought to be the first discovered exoplanet (although its existence was confirmed after those around PSR B1257+12.) The object orbits the primary star every 83.9 days at an approximate distance of 0.37 AU, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.57; for comparison, this orbit is similar to that of Mercury but with almost three times the eccentricity. Based on the radial velocity measurements alone, it was estimated to have a minimum mass of (at 90¬∞) and a probable mass of approximately (at 10¬∞).

California Angels Schaal became the Angels regular third baseman in his rookie season in 1965. He quickly established himself as a slick fielding but light hitting player. Most experts feel Schaal would have won multiple gold glove awards had it not been for Brooks Robinson. But Schaal struggled at the plate, batting .224 in 1965 and .244 in 1966. When his average plummeted to .188 in 1967 and .210 in 1968, he was forced to platoon at 3B for the Angels with Aurelio Rodr√≠guez, who was a better hitter. In 1968, Schaal was badly beaned by Jos√© Santiago of the Boston Red Sox. He spent 12 days in the hospital afterwards and had balance problems after his discharge. Kansas City Royals After his subpar seasons in 1967 and 1968, the Angels left Schaal unprotected and he was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft of 1969. Schaal's career took off from there as he became the Royals' everyday third baseman. He posted batting averages of .263 in 1969, .268 in 1970, and .274 in 1971 (when he also tallied his career high in home runs with 11). After slumping to .228 in 1972, Schaal rebounded with his career high .288 in 1973. In 1974, Schaal started slowly, batting only .176 in 12 games with the Royals. With future Hall of Famer George Brett ready to take over third base duties for Kansas City, the Royals traded Schaal back to the Angels for outfielder Richie Scheinblum. Schaal finished his career playing 53 games for the Angels, batting .248. Death Schaal died from cancer on September 1, 2017, aged 74.

Following its predecessor Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Africa, this Arctic sequel combines educational value and entertainment. The game allows players to build and manage ecosystems of Arctic animals by interacting with the environment using \\"tools of nature\\", such as the sun, snow, wind, and sickness. There are five different environments in the game, from an oil-rig off the coast of Svalbard, Norway, to a new pipeline disturbing the caribou herds in the Alaskan level. While the game maintains impartiality on environmental issues, players are left to discover for themselves the impact of global warming and deforestation throughout the seasons in their sim- ecosystems and the 22 animal species which comprise them. The visual art was inspired by traditional Inuit sculpture. The music is a reinterpretation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons Concerto using Inuit-inspired instruments and instruments brought to the region by explorers. Venture Arctic was designed, produced, and programmed by Andy Schatz, founder of Pocketwatch Games and host of the 2007 and 2008 Independent Games Festival Awards ceremonies.  Venture Arctic animals  Arctic cod - Arctic cod are found in massive schools throughout the arctic every year. Many animals dine on these small fish, so they survive based upon their large numbers. Arctic fox - The Arctic fox hunts for small rodents and birds in the summer. In the winter months when food is scarce the Arctic fox becomes a scavenger, often following polar bears or wolves to feast on the remains of their prey. Arctic hare - The Arctic hare is particularly suited to escaping predation on the icy tundra. They are very fast, traveling at speeds up to forty miles per hour. Their blue-grey pelt turns pure white in the winter to help camouflage them from predators. Arctic wolf - Arctic wolves reside in territory further north than any permanent human settlement and thus they are unafraid of human scent. This lack of fear has provided scientists with opportunities to study Arctic wolf packs up close and in great detail. Bowhead whale - Bowhead whales travel the Arctic seas in pods grazing on plankton. Extremely large and powerful animals that can weigh over ten tons, bowhead whales will create breathing holes by breaking through up to four feet of ice. Caribou - Caribou eat grass and shrubs in the summer. In the winter, they use their shovel shaped hooves to dig through the snow searching for lichen. Both male and female caribou have antlers, allowing for the females to compete with males for food and dominance. Greenland shark - Greenland sharks prey on fish and marine mammals and are particularly attracted to the smell of rotten meat. Their flesh is poisonous to humans and dogs when raw but is traditionally used as food for sled dogs when dried. Harp seal - Harp seals spend most of their life in the water and can hold their breath for fifteen minutes. Newborn pups weigh twenty pounds at birth but gain over fifty pounds in the first week of their life from their mother's nutrient-rich milk. Muskox - Muskoxen have large horns and thick, hard skulls. When threatened by bears or wolves a herd of muskoxen will gather in a circle with their young in the middle. They will then take turns charging their attacker. Narwhal - The narwhal has only two teeth. One stays small while one (usually the left tooth) grows up to nine feet long through the narwhal's upper lip. In most cases, only male narwhals grow the giant tusk. Orca - Orcas travel in groups composed of ten to fifty individuals. These pods are often made up of two to three generations of the same family. Adolescent orcas help care for the young in the pod by training them to hunt fish and seals. Polar bear - Under their thick white coats, polar bears have black skin which they use to absorb the sun's rays. Their paws are large and webbed, giving them traction on the ice and making them excellent swimmers. Puffin - One of the only three birds in the game, it only eats cod. Snowy owl One of the only three birds in the game, it eats hares, lemmings, and might scavenge a carcass. Wolverine - Wolverines look like bears but are actually related to weasels. They are solitary creatures who may roam up to fifteen miles in one day looking for food. Although they will eat vegetation, wolverines prefer meat and are determined hunters. Common raven - One of the only three birds in the game, a common raven also leads you through the tutorial.

Chang established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre as a resident company at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in 1977, with the intention of popularizing Asian-American theater. Mel Gussow of The New York Times noted that \\"Before Pan Asian Rep, Asian Americans had severely limited opportunities in the theater‚Ä¶ [now] heartened by Ms. Chang's example, similar companies have sprung up around the United States.\\"Mel Gussow, \\"A Stage for All the World of Asian-Americans\\", New York Times, April 22nd, 1997. For over thirty years, Pan Asian has created opportunities for underrepresented artists to stage modern classics that give insight into the Asian-American experience. Specializing in intercultural productions of new Asian-American plays, Asian classics in translation, and innovative adaptations of Western classics, some of the works Pan Asian has presented included: *Empress of China - featuring Tina Chen in the title role of China's last dowager ruler *Yellow Fever - continued to an Off-Broadway run *Ghashiram Kotwal - Marathi play with music *Teahouse - by Lao She, spanning fifty years of modern Chinese history *Cambodia Agonistes - by Ernest Abuba, music by Louis Stewart *The Teahouse of the August Moon - by John Patrick *Forbidden City Blues - by Alexander Woo *The Fan Tan King - by C.

Leethe, world premiere *Yohen - by Philip Kan Gotanda *Tea - by Velina Hasu Houston, 20th anniversary production Pan Asian has staged early works of writers including Momoko Iko, Wakako Yamauchi, Philip Kan Gotanda, R. A. Shiomi, and David Henry Hwang. Pan Asian Rep had a season in the West End Theatre in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, and in 2007 returned to the Julia Miles Theatre to revive their classic productions with a large cast. Major programs include the Senior Artist Resident Ensemble, the Theatre For Youth program, touring and residencies domestically and internationally, the Staged Reading Series directed by Ron Nakahara, and Actor Training Workshops taught by Ernest Abuba. The company has been invited to several national theater festivals including Edinburgh in 1988, Singapore in 1992, Cairo and Johannesburg (1995), and the Xi Havana Theatre Festival in 2003. From June 11‚Äì24, 2007, Pan Asian served along with Ma-Yi Theater and NAATCO as a Co-Steering Committee member of the first National Asian American Theatre Festival. The two-week festival brought work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and ensembles from across the United States to 13 venues around New York City. Pan Asian celebrated its 39th anniversary in 2016, and continues a cycle of Masterpiece productions. The cycle began in 2007 with The Joy Luck Club, a play by Susan Kim adapted from the novel by Amy Tan, directed and choreographed by Tisa Chang. In 2008, Pan Asian presented the first professional theatrical production of The Missing Woman, written and directed by Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc. The play was performed in Vietnamese and English, and enabled diverse audiences to explore themes of social justice and human rights through the lens of traditional Vietnamese art forms. The Missing Woman represented Pan Asian's efforts towards international artistic collaboration. Shogun Macbeth opened the 2008 season. Adapted by John R. Briggs from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the epic production combined medieval history with traditional Japanese techniques of Noh, Kyogen, and Samurai sword fighting, while retaining the complexity of Shakespearean language. Ernest Abuba, who had acted in the title role 22 years prior, directed the 2008 production. In the fall of 2009, the company produced Imelda, a new musical based on the controversial figure of Imelda Marcos. Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and East West Players collaborated on this production, which was directed by Tim Dang, with the book by Sachi Oyama, lyrics by Aaron Coleman, music by Nathan Wang, and choreography by Reggie Lee. In spring 2010, Pan Asian produced the East Coast premiere of Ching Chong Chinaman, a comedy by Lauren Yee and directed by May Adrales. The work used the pejorative jingle to examine common assumptions about identity and culture. Pan Asian continued their relationship with Vietnamese audiences and artists with 2011's \\"Vietnam Project II: Past and Present\\". This included productions of Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc's We Are, about Vietnamese women who work or marry abroad, and Derek Nguyen's Monster, about a Vietnamese-American detective in search of a missing child and his past. The company's 35th anniversary season included Shanghai Lil's by Lilah Kan with music by Louis Stewart, a musical about the nightclub scene in San Francisco's Chinatown just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor; and Mayank Keshaviah's Rangoon, a world premiere about a family of Indian immigrants pursuing the American Dream. For their 41st season starting in 2017, Pan-Asian Rep featured the show Daybreak by Joyce Van Dyke, which features the Armenian Genocide in the 1920s. If asked why Armenia, Chang replies: \\"Because Pan Asian is all of Asia and Polynesia. And I also feel the Middle East needs to be represented. It‚Äôs a very affirming play and, again, a story seldom told. If anything, history tends to hide traumatic periods, so I think that it‚Äôs a great service we do presenting these stories.\\" See also * Asian American theatre * Tisa Chang References External links * Pan Asian Repertory Theatre official website * Pan Asian Repertory Theatre on La MaMa Archives Digital Collections Category:Off- Broadway theaters Category:Asian-American theatre Category:Theatre companies in New York City Category:1977 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Pan Asian Repertory Theatre"},{"id":"12447364","text":"Bob, Agent of Hydra (Robert Dobalina) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as an antihero and a sidekick of Deadpool. A former member of the terrorist agency Hydra, he defected to help Wade Wilson, but has kept his Hydra uniform. Bob had a cameo in the 2016 feature film Deadpool where he was portrayed by Rob Hayter. Publication history Bob first appeared in Cable & Deadpool #38 (May, 2007) and was created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Reilly Brown. Fictional character biography A cowardly young man, Bob was persuaded into joining the criminal organization Hydra by his wife, Allison, who accused him of not being able to hold a steady job. The thought of a stable career with a dental plan also appealed to Bob, though he was disappointed to find out Hydra does not offer full dental like Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). During Deadpool's assault on Hydra to rescue the captured Agent X, he ran into Bob and coerced Bob into helping him. Bob was hesitant, as Hydra would not allow him back into the organization after having betrayed them, but Deadpool, at the time four inches tall, tortured him with a security card until he relented. He then forced Bob to fly them to safety in one of Hydra's jets, though Bob did not know how to pilot an aircraft.Cable & Deadpool #38 After Deadpool, Agent X, and Bob returned to the United States, they found Outlaw and Sandi missing. Bob accompanied Deadpool on his mission to save the girls and subsequently became an honorary member of Agency X. He continues to work with the group on their various missions, and is referred to as Deadpool's \\"Minion\\" (or \\"Pet\\"). During a raid on the very same Hydra base Deadpool kidnapped him from, in an attempt to save Weasel from Wolverine, Bob was shot in the leg. Weasel had been left behind in the raid Bob had been picked up on. Deadpool knew that, when Wolverine targeted the base, Weasel's chances for survival were slim. When Wolverine cuts off Deadpool's head, Bob put it back in order to let Deadpool's healing factor take effect. At the end of the incident, most of Bob's former co-workers are slain. Weasel sends the rest to prison using teleportation technology.\\"Cable # Deadpool\\" #43 (Sept. 2007) Weasel saves the others with the teleportation technology but it later malfunctions. Deadpool and Bob are sent into the past, where they aid Captain America and Bucky in stopping Arnim Zola. Following that adventure, Bob accompanied Deadpool on a mission through various dimensions to help Doctor Strange save reality after it was damaged by T-Ray's novice magic.Cable & Deadpool #44-#48 (2008) Bob also traveled with Deadpool and Weasel to the Savage Land, where he ran away from an assortment of dinosaurs. Deadpool attempted to teleport the dinos to Genosha as a prank on Magneto, but instead they were sent to the Genoshan Embassy in downtown Manhattan, being infected with the alien Symbiotes responsible for Venom and Carnage. During the resultant battle, Bob's attempt to flee accidentally caused the death of one of the creatures while a news crew watched. Thinking his actions were intentional, they interviewed Bob who claimed the 'H' on his uniform stood for \\"Hero\\". He then received a text message from Allison who had seen the events on the news and thought it was hot. Bob is seen watching television with Deadpool and his supporting cast as the series ends.Deadpool #7 Bob is later seen assisting Deadpool defeat Tiger Shark. When Deadpool tells Bob to throw him a rifle, Bob does not throw it far enough. The rifle falls into the water, where Tiger Shark is waiting, and Bob is knocked into the water. Deadpool saves Bob at the last second and they are able to outmaneuver Tiger Shark for a while, although Bob is shot in the hand by Deadpool. Bob explains to Deadpool that he along with Tiger Shark were hired by Norman Osborn. Deadpool soon realizes Green Goblin stole from him during the height of the Secret Invasion against the Skrulls.Deadpool #6-7 Later, Bob is called upon by Deadpool to join him in becoming a pirate. Bob abandons his wife to answer the call. Due to severe beatings, he gets stuck as Deadpool's parrot. With Deadpool's lack of navigational skills they become lost at sea for six weeks and Bob develops scurvy (or possibly heat stroke). Bob attempts to gain help from Kalani, a blind, beautiful information clerk on Jallarka, a tropical island the two were planning to 'pirate'.Deadpool #13 (2010) Bob is pleased to be forced to spend time with this lady when Deadpool's insanity causes him to demand her platonic companionship in exchange for saving the island from other pirates. She is pleased to make this exchange.Deadpool #14 (2010) The three work together and kill all the pirates thanks to a nuclear submarine Deadpool had previously bought and sunken. Kalani falls for Bob and asks him to stay behind with her but his husbandly loyalty is too strong. However, he is forced to stay behind as Deadpool abandons Bob and Kalani with a crateful of gold and musings on how he wants to help people instead of rob them.Deadpool #15 (2010) During the World War Hulks storyline, Bob uses a time platform to send Hulkpool (a gamma-powered Deadpool) back in time to kill Deadpool. Unfortunately, it sends him to an alternate reality where Thing is Blackbeard. Bob tries to correct the mistakes and ends up transporting dinosaurs to that reality. Further mistakes in that timeline cause Bob to be revered as an all powerful God by the entirety of modern-day Earth.World War Hulks: Hulked Out Heroes #1 - #2 (2010) Bob gets on the wrong side of a gang war between Tombstone and the Kingpin. Desperate to save his friend's life, Deadpool battles X-Force, who were trying to take him down. They agree to leave Deadpool alone when they realize he is simply trying to save Bob.\\"Deadpool\\" Vol. 2 #50-52 (2012) Bob assists Deadpool when an old enemy threatens all of reality. Disposing of 'T-Ray' had caused magical breakage through multiple realms, so Doctor Strange sends Deadpool and Bob through said realms; their mission requires a monster slain in each one. Deadpool usually ends up saving Bob's life in each realm as well.Deadpool #46-49 (2013) After two years of absence, Deadpool again calls upon Bob to help secure an escape route for him and Shiklah. Despite initially being offended by Deadpool's long absence, he agrees to help,Deadpool - The Gauntlet #5 somehow getting a HYDRA Carrier to kidnap (thus, saving) the couple. However, the trio gets kidnapped by MODOK, interested in Shiklah's succubus powers.Deadpool - The Gauntlet #6 They manage to escape, but in the process Bob gets his legs badly crushed and, as Shiklah pleads for his safety, Deadpool agrees to dump him to a veterinarian clinic at first, then a real hospital.Deadpool - The Gauntlet #8 He recovers enough to help Deadpool fend off Dracula's forces, using a stolen MODOK's chair to move around in his broken legs.Deadpool - The Gauntlet #12 He eventually manages to make a full recovery, attending Wade and Shiklah's marriage.Deadpool #27 (2014) Much later, a mysterious conspiracy draws in those Deadpool cares for. This garners Bob a severe beating.Deadpool #4 (2016) Later, Bob is a host for a returned Madcap, partially regenerated after vaporizing himself. He imbedded himself inside Bob, and forced Bob to assist him in his revenge against Deadpool. Madcap then tore himself from Bob to attach Deadpool. Bob is again working for Deadpool. Wade Wilson had erased several years of his own memory, due to highly unpleasant incidents. Bob assists Negasonic Teenage Warhead in taking Deadpool to the physics-defying realm of 'Weirdworld'. Bob was able to rig a communication system that mostly ignored the weirdness of Weirdworld.Deadpool Volume 5 #4 (2018) Powers and abilities Bob has no superpowers and does not have training in any combat or tactical skills. The training Hydra gives its minions seems primarily focused on running away and hiding when confronted with danger, making Bob a parody of the cannon-fodder henchmen frequently seen working for evil organizations in comic books. Even this training seems useless, as Bob has cited such Hydra lessons as \\"Hiding behind each other\\" and \\"If I can't see them they can't see me.\\" Deadpool has said that Bob is better at running away than anyone he has seen. Bob has a pathological fear ingrained in him of certain characters who are particularly devastating enemies of Hydra. Among these are Captain America, Wolverine, and Elektra. Notably, Bob has mentioned Hydra specifically trains their minions to flee as quickly as possible upon hearing the distinctive \\"snikt\\" sound of Wolverine's claws. When stressed he has a tendency to shout \\"Hail Hydra!\\" and other propaganda of the organization such as \\"Cut off one head and two more will take its place!\\" Despite his incompetence, Bob sometimes gets lucky. He was able to fly a plane a long distance despite having no knowledge of how to do so,Cable & Deadpool Issue #38 and killed a Symbiote-possessed dinosaur by accident while fleeing from it.Cable & Deadpool Issue #50 He was also able to save Deadpool's life during a battle with Wolverine by staying put to reattach his head despite his cowardice.Cable & Deadpool Issue #44 Even though he is useless in a fight, Deadpool seems to delight in taking him on dangerous missions, seemingly for his own amusement. Bob goes along with him, although it is unclear whether this is because he is afraid of Wade or genuinely considers him a friend - or because he's a committed minion and does not know what else to do. Despite his shortcomings and his cowardice, Bob's strength lies in him being a dedicated friend, challenging his own fears to help his friends.  Other versions   Identity Wars  In an alternate universe visited by Deadpool, Hulk and Spider-Man, Bob is a red-suited lackey of that version of Wade Wilson, a powered crime lord of New York City. Feeling the need to eliminate his rival's murderous empire, Deadpool kills his way through his counterpart's men; Bob gets flattened under an I-beam.Deadpool Annual Vol. 1 #1 (May 2011)  Marvel Max  In Deadpool Max, Bob is a CIA agent and the reluctant handler of the deranged Deadpool, charged with keeping up the facade that the missions Deadpool is assigned all somehow involve taking down the entirely fictional terrorist organization Hydra. In other media Film * Bob appears as one of Ajax's henchmen in the 2016 live-action Deadpool feature film, portrayed by Rob Hayter. It is not stated that he is a member of Hydra in this version as the film rights to Hydra are held by Marvel Studios (this was before the rights to Deadpool and X-Men were reverted to Marvel Studios). During a fight with Ajax's men, Deadpool recognized Bob during the fight and just knocks him out instead of killing him. It is unknown if he survived Negasonic Teenage Warhead's last burst that caused the hull to roll over on top of the fire fight and everything in the immediate area.

Although a prolific novelist and painter, he was never really able to trump his father's greater reputation and is now primarily remembered for his ties to fellow novelist Marcel Proust (Remembrance of Things Past). Daudet was also friends with Jean Cocteau. Biography Marcel Proust (seated), Robert de Flers (left), and Lucien Daudet (right), ca. 1894 The Daudet family was composed of the father, Alphonse, the mother Julia (n√©e Allard), L√©on, the older brother, Edm√©e, and Lucien. Every member of the family wrote books: father, mother, brother, sister, sister-in-law (Marthe Allard under the pseudonym of ‚ÄúPampille‚Äù) and uncle (Ernest Daudet). Lucien himself published about fifteen books. Cultivated, ‚Äúvery beautiful, very elegant, a thin and frail young man, with a tender and a somewhat effeminate face‚Äù, according to Jean-Yves Tadi√©, Daudet lived a fashionable life which made him meet Marcel Proust. In 1897, Jean Lorrain publicly questioned the nature of Proust's relationship with Lucien Daudet. Proust challenged Lorrain to a duel over the implication that Proust and Daudet were lovers. Both duelists survived. Lucien Daudet was also a painter. After having taken lessons at the Acad√©mie Julian, he was a pupil of Whistler and had an exposition together with Bernheim-Jeune in 1906. His tableaux are not known anymore except by literary allusions to them (correspondence of Proust; catalogue by Anna de Noailles).(fr)appl Lachaise, Lucien Daudet All his life, Daudet was overshadowed by his father in literature (\\"I am the son of a man whose celebrity and talent count for several generations, I remain under his shade\\"), and by Whistler in painting (\\"He gave me a certain taste in painting, but also very great contempt for that which is not of first rank... and I apply this contempt to what I make.\\") Towards the end of his life, in 1943, he married Marie-Th√©r√®se, the younger sister of Pierre Benoit.

At 21, Clark had a highly promising rookie season for the pennant-contending Angels, but struggled thereafter during his big league career. Born in Mount Clemens, Michigan, Clark was signed by his hometown Detroit Tigers in 1965, after graduating from Redford Union High School and just prior to the institution of the Major League Baseball Draft. After two seasons in the Tiger farm system, the Angels selected the , pitcher in the 1966 Rule 5 draft. Sparkling rookie season Rule 5's terms (then as now) dictated that the Angels keep Clark on their 25-man big-league roster for the entire 1967 season or offer him back to the Detroit organization, but Clark would earn his place in the Angels' starting rotation on merit. After he won his MLB debut on April 22 with four scoreless innings in relief against the Cleveland Indians, Clark made his first start eight days later against the New York Yankees; he went seven innings, allowed only four hits and two earned runs, and collected his second big-league triumph. Manager Bill Rigney then kept Clark as a regular member of the Angel starting staff through the remainder of the season, in which the Angels battled for the American League pennant before fading in September. Clark won 12 games, tying him with staff ace Jim McGlothlin and closer Minnie Rojas for the team lead in victories. His 2.59 earned run average also was best among Angel starters. He threw a two-hit, complete game shutout against the Washington Senators on September 8 at D.C. Stadium.Retrosheet box score: 1967-09-08 It was his only complete game and shutout of the season. Later MLB career The following year, , saw Clark lose nine of his first ten decisions (despite a respectable 3.27 earned run average) and drop out of the Angel starting rotation in early July. He worked in only 94 innings pitched, half of his 1967 workload, and finished the year with a 1‚Äì11 record. He then spent most of , all of , and the early weeks of in the minor leagues. But the Angels recalled him in June 1971, and in his third appearance and second starting assignment, Clark tossed another two-hit shutout, this time against the eventual division champion Oakland Athletics at Anaheim Stadium on July 2.Retrosheet box score: 1971-07-02 Those two-hitters, almost four years apart, would be the only shutouts of his MLB career. Clark spent the entire season with the Angels, working in 26 games (with 15 starts) and hurling two more complete games. But he posted a 4‚Äì9 record and a 4.51 earned run average and during the offseason his contract was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies' organization, where he spent 1973 at Triple-A before leaving baseball. In 96 major league games pitched (70 starts), Clark won 19 games and lost 32 (.373) with a 3.38 career earned run average. In 431 innings pitched, he allowed 371 hits and 213 bases on balls, striking out 236.

The game was released worldwide. Konami offered the game as a paid download or pre- installed in a Metal Gear-branded cell phone. It shows Solid Snake in his attire from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. On February 14, 2008, Metal Gear Solid Mobile won the \\"Grand Prix\\" and \\"Operator's Choice\\" awards at the 2008 International Mobile Gaming Awards. Metal Gear Solid Mobile was later released by Nokia on the N-Gage platform. The new version features original content, 3D art and camera works, an in-game camouflage system, and additional controls specific for N-Gage mobile devices. This version of the game was released on December 11, 2008. Story The story takes place between Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, after Revolver Ocelot has leaked technical information on Metal Gear REX to the world. As a counter- measure, Solid Snake and Otacon form Philanthropy, an anti-Metal Gear organization whose goal is the complete eradication of all Metal Gears. Otacon quickly receives his first lead on development of a new Metal Gear. AI programmer Dr. Victoria Reed has agreed to reveal new details on the Metal Gear in exchange for assistance in her escape. Midway through the mission however, it turns out Victoria Reed means VR. Snake finds out the Otacon he is talking to is part of a giant VR simulation. Otacon from the outside world then breaks in and helps guide Snake out of the VR simulation. Snake fights \\"The Commander\\" on top of a VR Metal Gear Rex. After defeating him, Snake wakes up to unnamed voices speaking. They say that while Snake did prove useful, he failed to provide them with the battle data they needed for the Project, and they instruct someone to erase all memories of the simulation and dump him back where they kidnapped him. One unnamed voice then says that they already have the second test subject lined up. One of the voices then says, \\"...Let's see if Jack can do better.\\"  References  External links *Official website Category:2008 video games Category:Mobile games Category:N-Gage service games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Metal Gear spin- off games ","title":"Metal Gear Solid Mobile"},{"id":"12447471","text":"Some women to have held the title Duchess of Northumberland, as wives of the Duke of Northumberland, include: ;First creation * Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland (1508/9‚Äì1555), (n√©e Guildford), wife of the duke ;Third creation * Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1716‚Äì1776), (n√©e Seymour), wife of the 1st duke * Frances Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1752‚Äì1820), (n√©e Burrell), wife of the 2nd duke * Charlotte Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1787‚Äì1866), (n√©e Clive), wife of the 3rd duke * Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1870‚Äì1960), (n√©e Grosvenor), wife of the 4th duke * Helen Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1886‚Äì1965), (n√©e Lennox-Gordon), wife of the 8th duke * Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1922‚Äì2012), (n√©e Montagu Douglas Scott), wife of the 10th duke * Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (born 1958), wife of the 12th duke # ","title":"Duchess of Northumberland"},{"id":"12447475","text":"William Fredrick Bean (December 26, 1933 ‚Äì February 6, 2012) was an American jazz guitarist from Philadelphia.

He was the eldest son of Sir John Shelley, 4th Baronet and Margaret Pelham, two of whose brothers (Henry Pelham and The Duke of Newcastle) served as British Prime Minister. He entered Parliament at a by-election in 1751, probably at the first opportunity once he was legally old enough to do so, as Member of Parliament for East Retford, a pocket borough owned by his uncle Newcastle; the vacancy arose from the appointment of the sitting MP as a Commissioner of the Excise, quite possibly with the specific intention of freeing the seat for Shelley. He represented this constituency until 1768 when, having fallen out with Newcastle, he moved to represent nearby Newark (which had once also been under Newcastle's control but now belonged to another of Newcastle's nephews, the Earl of Lincoln, who had also quarrelled with his uncle). He was later also MP for New Shoreham. In 1755, on the recommendation of Newcastle (who had become Prime Minister on his brother's death the previous year), Shelley was appointed to the desirable sinecure-for- life of Keeper of the Records of the Tower of London, worth ¬£420 a year. In 1757 he acquired another lucrative post, Clerk of the Pipe, and in 1766 he became Treasurer of His Majesty's Household and was appointed to the Privy Council. Michelgrove House, 1782 Shelley succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death on 5 September 1771, taking possession of Michelgrove, Sussex. He married Wilhelmina Newnham (died 1772), daughter of John Newnham of Maresfield Park, by whom he had a son, John, who succeeded him. After the death of his first wife he married again, to Elizabeth Woodcock, and they had three daughters. He retired from Parliament in 1780, and died in 1783.

Samuel Thomas Evans in The Times history of the war (1914) (14577874670) Sir Samuel Thomas Evans (4 May 1859 - 13 September 1918), was a Welsh barrister, judge and Liberal politician. Background and education Evans was born at Skewen, near Neath, Glamorganshire, the only son of John Evans, a grocer, and his wife Margaret, both originally of Cardiganshire. He was educated in Swansea, at University College, Aberystwyth, and the University of London. Family Evans married firstly Rachel, daughter of William Thomas, in 1887. They had one son. After his first wife's death in 1889 he married secondly Blanche, daughter of Charles Rule, in 1905. They had one daughter. Legal career He qualified as a solicitor in 1883. On 28 April 1891 he was admitted to the Middle Temple and on 10 June 1891 he was called to the Bar.Williamson, J.B. (1937). The Middle Temple Bench Book. 2nd edition, p.270. Evans gained a large practice on the South Wales circuit and in 1901 he became the last QC appointed by Queen Victoria. He served on the Neath Town Council during the 1880s. He was a Recorder of Swansea from 1906 to 1908 and became a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1908. His reputation as a judge rests mostly on his role as President of the Prize Court established during the First World War. Political career In 1889, Evans sought election to the inaugural Glamorgan County Council but was unsuccessful both at the initial election and the by- election which followed the successful Conservative candidate's elevation to the aldermanic bench. In 1890 he was elected to the House of Commons for Mid Glamorgan. He combined his parliamentary work with his legal practice in Wales. He was re-elected in 1892, 1895 and at the Khaki General Election of 1900; At the General Election of January/February 1906 he was returned Unopposed.The Times House of Commons Guide 1910, 1911, 1919, Poltico's Publishing Page 92 1910 Section In October 1906 upon appointment as Recorder of Swansea, in accordance with the times he was required to seek re-election and in the by-election he was returned unopposed. In 1908, he was appointed Solicitor-General in the Liberal administration of H. H. Asquith and knighted upon taking office. He was re-elected at the following general election, in January 1910; He was then sworn of the Privy Council in 1910. In March 1910 Evans decided to give up his political career and accept the post of President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice. His appointment was not popular with the legal establishment as he was considered to have little experience in these fields. He was appointed a GCB in 1916. However, he declined the offer of a peerage. Evans died in September 1918 aged 59 and was buried at Skewen.  Electoral results  References Sources Books and Journals *Davis, H. W. C.; Weaver, J. R.

The cruise starts in New York City on July 11, 2004, and sails along the U.S. East Coast, stopping in Key West, Florida, and then in Nassau, Bahamas. Five hundred families attended the cruise, including LGBT parents as well as non-LGBT people. In the film, Rosie and Kelli's family, along with several other families on the cruise are interviewed, including former Hawaiian NFL star Esera Tuaolo along with his partner and their children. Comedian Judy Gold also makes appearances. When the ship stops in the Bahamas, the cruise members are met with protests from some local Christians, though interviews show that there were many locals who did not have a problem with LGBT people and did not agree with the action of the protesters.

Design and development  The P.B.23 was designed in 1915 as a single-seat biplane scout, with a fuselage nacelle strut-mounted between the wings. The nacelle had an open cockpit for the pilot at the front and at the rear an 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rh√¥ne 9C engine driving a pusher propeller. Twin fins and rudders were mounted on a wide-span tailplane with an elevator attached, all connected to the wing structure with four tailbooms. The P.B.23 failed to gain an order after it first flew in September 1915, but twenty of an improved version, the P.B.25, were ordered by the Royal Naval Air Service. The P.B.25 had swept-back wings, a modified landing gear and a revised fuselage nacelle and although originally powered by a 110 hp (82 kW) Clerget rotary engine, the 20 RNAS aircraft were fitted with Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2 rotary piston engines.

The 2007 Tour de France was affected by a series of scandals and speculations related to doping. By the end of the Tour, two cyclists were dismissed for failing tests and the wearer of the yellow jersey was voluntarily retired by his team for lying about his whereabouts and missing doping tests. A fourth rider was confirmed to having used doping while in a training session prior to the 2007 Tour and a fifth rider failed tests late in the race, with his result being officially announced just after the end of the Tour. During the competition, two teams were asked to withdraw after at least one member was found to have doped. The events generated criticism and a general distrustful attitude toward the sport of professional cycling from media and public opinion. The doping allegations also resulted in several team sponsors threatening to retire their support if events advanced further. Some media such as German TV channels ARD and ZDF left the Tour once the first scandals broke. Following the Tour's conclusion, the sport's governing bodies spoke out about ways to combat the prevalence of doping in cycling and key team sponsors elected to withdraw their support due to the reputational damage caused by the scandals. The 2007 Tour de France has been referred to as one of the most controversial Tours. After the end of the Tour, The Times of London ranked it 4th in its list of the top 50 sporting scandals. Background Floyd Landis on the 2006 Tour de France Since the introduction of doping tests in 1964, many cyclists were caught in the Tour de France. In recent years, 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis and points classification winner Erik Zabel, along with most of their Team Telekom team-mates, confessed to using erythropoietin (EPO).BBC Sports News, Zabel admits to doping at Telekom In 1997, former points classification winner Djamolidine Abdoujaparov was disqualified from the Tour de France for doping use.Cycling News, July 1997, Uzbekistan's Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, expelled from the Tour de France for doping In 1998, the Festina affair had several main contenders removed from the race. In the next years, several riders were removed from the Tour de France for doping (see List of doping cases in cycling). In addition, several riders were not allowed to start the previous Tour, including Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso because of their involvement in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case, a Spanish investigation against doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and a number of accomplices accused of administering prohibited doping products to approximately two hundred professional athletes, to enhance their performance. After the completion of the 2006 Tour, winner Floyd Landis was found to have an elevated testosterone to epitestosterone ratio on a sample taken following Stage 17 of the race, and at the time of the 2007 Tour prologue. Since the results of an independent arbitration hearing were still pending Landis was prevented from defending his title. He was stripped of his 2006 Tour title in September 2007. Events immediately before the Tour Alessandro Petacchi Alessandro Petacchi, a sprint specialist, failed a test for salbutamol at Pinerolo on 23 May in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, the same day he claimed the third of his five-stage wins in the event. As a result, Petacchi, an asthma sufferer, was suspended by Team Milram and forced to miss the Tour de France because of the charges. Though he seemed cleared of the charges at one point, he was later suspended for one year. On May 25, Bjarne Riis admitted he had won the overall competition of the 1996 edition under the effects of performance-enhancing drugs, claiming \\"for a time [doping] was a part of everyday life for me\\", and he was later stripped of the title. Five other former Telekom teammates were also implicated in doping. On May 24, riders Erik Zabel and Rolf Aldag had earlier admitted to using banned blood booster EPO in the mid-1990s. Other high-profile potential Tour riders were caught up in doping controversies. Giro d'Italia winner Danilo di Luca remained under investigation and 2006 Giro winner Ivan Basso was banned for two years on 15 June for his part in events uncovered by Operaci√≥n Puerto. During the Tour Despite Petacchi's failed test result prior to the Tour prologue, the first stages were uneventful in terms of doping allegations. It was not until Stage 8 before the first doping allegations surfaced against one of the participants. German cyclist Patrik Sinkewitz failed tests for elevated levels of testosterone at a June 8, 2007 pre-Tour training camp. Immediately prior to Stage 12, reports began to surface that the then current race leader, Michael Rasmussen had been dropped by the Danish Cycling Union in the month prior to the Tour following claims he had missed three out-of-competition doping tests. Tour director Christian Prudhomme nevertheless allowed the rider to continue in the absence of a failed test result. Days later on 24 July, pre-race favourite Alexander Vinokourov was withdrawn from the Tour after Stage 15. Vinokourov had returned a failed A test for an illegal blood transfusion from a compatible donor before the Stage 13 individual time trial on July 21, in which he placed first. In addition to Vinokourov, who was in 23rd place overall, the entire Astana Team was forced to withdraw, affecting highly placed riders such as 5th placed Andreas Kl√∂den and 8th placed Andrey Kashechkin. The following day, after finishing Stage 16, which had begun with a protest by riders, it emerged that Italian cyclist Cristian Moreni had failed tests for testosterone after Stage 11, in which he finished 102nd. He was immediately pulled out of the race by his team, Cofidis (who had participated in the day's protest). Team Cofidis then voluntarily retired the rest of their riders from the Tour. Michael Rasmussen On 25 July Michael Rasmussen won Stage 16; with a three-minute lead, he appeared all but certain to win the Tour the next day. However, hours after his victory, Rasmssen's team, Rabobank, abruptly pulled Rasmussen from the Tour and sacked him for a violation of the team's internal rules. The Danish rider had given incorrect information to Rabobank's sports director about his whereabouts which followed on from earlier reports that he had missed previous out-of-competition doping control tests. With the sport reeling from the revelations, the Tour continued as allegations began to surface regarding new race leader Alberto Contador (see Alberto Contador below). While no further rider or team withdrawals occurred before the race's conclusion in Paris, it later emerged that two more riders Andrey Kashechkin and Iban Mayo had failed tests for doping during the Tour's later stages. Reaction to events during the Tour Prior to Rasmussen's exit, the doping revelations of Sinkewitz and Vinokourov had been met with defiance by the UCI, the Tour organizers and the majority of the European press (with certain exceptions) however, with Rasmussen's sacking whilst wearing the yellow jersey (no rider had previously been withdrawn from the race while leading), the mood became more pessimistic, with the exception of Tour director Christian Prudhomme who publicly regarded the Dane's withdrawal as \\"the best thing that can happen to the Tour. The race will go on for the rest of the riders and we believe it would be an insult to them to stop the race. We believe the general classification is much better now than it was.\\" Prudhomme's reaction was in contrast to the French newspapers. France Soir ran a mock death notice declaring the Tour had died \\"at age 104, after a long illness.\\" Declaring further: \\"The Tour is clinically dead. It is a broken toy, a burst soap bubble popped by careless kids, unaware that they are damaging themselves, their health and their childhood dreams as well...It's all the more painful as we had almost begun to believe in the Tour again... in these soap-and-water cyclists who we were so ready to love. But instead of dreams, the last 48 hours have been a living nightmare.\\" A similar editorial in Le Figaro announced: \\"It really doesn't matter who wins the Tour. The 2007 edition died on 24 July on the heights of Loudenvielle...Killed by Alexander Vinokourov, idolised by the media and cycling fans, but revealed to have the blood of another running in his veins on the finishing line. Damn Vinokourov! He sullied the infinite beauty of the Pyrenees, dirtied cycling a little more and further discredited the Tour de France.\\" Another French newspaper, Lib√©ration's editorial demanded \\"The Tour must be stopped\\", describing the procession of cyclists as a \\"caravan of ridicule\\". The British popular media who had previously acclaimed the success of the Tour's prologue in London and the first stage through Kent, were similarly critical calling it the Tour de Farce (Daily Mirror) and declaring it a \\"Corrupt race populated by a cast of frauds heading straight into the gutter\\" (The Times). Swiss newspaper Tages- Anzeiger reduced its coverage of the race in protest to minimal reporting of results and full reporting of any doping stories. German television broadcasters ARD and ZDF stopped covering the race (after they vowed to in the Tour prelude) when Patrik Sinkewitz was revealed to have failed tests following Stage 8; Sat 1 and Pro Sieben replaced them as the German rightsholders. Most other media decided to stay, and some even criticised the German decision. Sponsors similarly indicated their unwillingness to continue to support a sport dogged by scandal, most noticeably Gerolsteiner and T-Mobile (the latter subsequently withdrew from sponsoring cycling later in the year). Team Rabobank's head of sponsorship Heleen Crielaard reacted to the Rasmussen dismissal stating: \\"We are a bank and we want to be reliable. One thing we definitely do not appreciate is lying...\\" although denied suggestions that they had influenced the decision to sack the rider. Despite calls for the Tour to be cancelled mid-race, the race continued principally on the basis that the race itself and its history is bigger than individual events.\\"It has survived over 104 years...I don't think a handful of cheats is going to stop it. But it's going to get to Paris in a very damaged state, just as it did in 1998.\\" per William Fotheringham, journalist with The Guardian on BBC Five Live, 25 July 2007 UCI director Pat McQuaid urged team directors and the riders to take responsibility: > \\"The teams need to have more control over their riders..\\"They are the ones > who need to clean out the riders who are iffy, they need to ensure they can > guarantee that everyone of their riders is riding clean and riding fairly. > The evidence is that most of the time these riders are dealing with > individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo > doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has got to stop. > More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of > riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to > come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of > the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process > of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the > bad apples. I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive > tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third.\\" Eddy Merckx who had won the Tour on five occasions, commented: \\"my heart is no longer in it\\" in response to his support for the Tour. Another Belgian rider Johan Museeuw (who had previously received a two-year ban for doping), suggested doping and drug use were a possible consequence of the difficulty of riding the Tour in its current format. Questioning why stages had to be so long and including several arduous 'out-of-category' mountain climbs. Following Vinokourov's exit, Patrice Clerc president of Tour organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) stated: \\"I am not downcast and I am all the more determined to go all the way in this fight...It may seem paradoxical but we are closing in on victory. I have been saying we have started a merciless war against doping...We live in dark times and it is out of the question to give up, it is out of the question to leave the place to those who cheat.\\" Particularly strong reaction came from Jean-Francois Lamour, vice president of the World Anti-Doping Agency who called for the Tour de France to be banned entirely and for road cycling to be withdrawn from the Olympic Games and former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Craig Reedie suggested that road cyclists might be required to hold an \\"anti-doping passport\\". French Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon attempted to stem the tide of negativity stating: \\"Obviously this gives a disastrous image of the Tour de France, but at the same time, if we encourage the organisers, we can clean up French sports and in particular cycling\\"; whilst Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, demonstrated support by joining the Tour and following the race leaders in the Tour director's car. Prior to Stage 16 a group of riders from eight teams - six from France plus German outfits Team Gerolsteiner and T-Mobile Team - forming the Mouvement pour un cyclisme cr√©dible (or Movement for Credible Cycling), delayed the start of the Tour by thirteen minutes asking for all teams to abide by their good behaviour charter of 2005, under which teams are requested to avoid fielding riders implicated in doping affairs. The protest was in obvious contrast to the 1998 reaction which was at odds with authorities, protesting at the heavy-handed treatment of riders. Tour riders generally remained encouraged however. Fabian Cancellara, Cedric Vasseur and David Millar all stated publicly that they believed the consensus among riders in the peloton was that anti-doping measures were effective and the sport would continue to benefit from the harder line. Riders who failed tests Patrik Sinkewitz Patrik Sinkewitz at the Henninger Turm 2006 Despite the rider's failed test result relating to a pre-Tour training camp, Sinkewitz competed in the race until Stage 8, when he collided with a spectator and withdrew from the event, at which point the test result emerged. Sinkewitz initially denied the allegation and called for his B sample to be tested. German television withdrew from covering the Tour in protest when his failed test came to light. On 31 July Sinkewitz subsequently retracted his denial and confessed to using a testosterone gel on his upper arms whilst training. Accepting the failed test result, Sinkewitz stated that: \\"It was a big mistake and irresponsible toward my team, colleagues, the sponsor and the whole of cycling.\\" T-Mobile responded to the admission by sacking Sinkewitz with immediate effect. Alexander Vinokourov Alexander Vinokourov began the Tour as one of the favourites. Vinokourov's A test revealed two different types of red blood cells in his circulatory system indicating he had a blood transfusion prior to the stage. A blood transfusion is meant to increase the number of red blood cells in the body, improving oxygen flow from the lungs to the muscles. Vinokourov rejected the failed test, blaming the anomaly on excessive blood flow in his thighs following a heavy collision earlier in the Tour. Accordingly, he asked for his B sample to be tested; however, the lab test for locating blood cells from another donor in \\"old fashioned\\" homologous transfusions is considered fool-proof. It was later revealed that he had also failed tests on his win of stage 15, and that his B sample had since returned \\"non-negative\\". Astana responded by sacking Vinokourov. Cristian Moreni Cristian Moreni Cofidis rider Moreni was placed 54th at the time he was withdrawn from the Tour and had participated in the rider protest prior to Stage 16. His failed test related to Stage 11 and Moreni decided not to ask for his B sample to be tested, admitting to doping according to Cofidis team manager Eric Boyer. Iban Mayo Spanish cyclist Iban Mayo was tested for doping on the second rest day, on July 24. The test failed for EPO after the Tour's conclusion. He was subsequently suspended by his team Saunier Duval- Prodir. Mayo had previously failed tests for a high testosterone-to- epitestosterone ratio during the 2007 Giro d'Italia, but on that occasion UCI found that he had not breached any doping regulation. Mayo placed 16th overall in the 2007 Tour. It later emerged in October 2007 that Mayo's B-sample would be re-tested after results from a laboratory in Ghent returned inconclusive results. Other affected riders Michael Rasmussen Despite being tested negative for doping before the Tour and seventeen times during the Tour, Michael Rasmussen was pulled from the race for violating team rules. According to Rabobank, he had told the UCI and the team that he was training in Mexico from June 4 to June 26, 2007. Italian cycling journalist and former cyclist Davide Cassani told a Danish television channel that he had seen Rasmussen on June 13 and 14 in the Dolomites in Italy. When Rabobank team director Theo de Rooij confronted Rasmussen with this story, according to news reports he allegedly admitted the lie. Rasmussen denied admitting this, however and told a Dutch newspaper (Algemeen Dagblad) \\"My career is ruined\\". Staehelin, Jacob. Michael Rasmussen: Jeg er gr√¶def√¶rdig, B.T. Tour section, p. 3, July 26, 2007. According to Team Rabobank spokesman Jacob Bergsma, when sponsor Rabobank learned of Rasmussen's deceit, they insisted that he be sent home immediately. Rasmussen had previously been given two warnings from UCI and two warnings from Anti Doping Denmark for missing out-of-competition doping controls. Three warnings from either organization would have landed him with a ban. The warnings had no immediate consequences, but cast a cloud of doubt about whether Rasmussen was doping. Michael Rasmussen's withdrawal came immediately after his dramatic victory in Stage 16, defending multiple attacks from Alberto Contador on a gruelling mountain pass. At the time he was holding the yellow jersey, leading the race by three minutes and ten seconds, and he appeared well on his way to winning the Tour. Over three months later on 8 November, Danish newspapers reported that Rasmussen had admitted misleading the UCI as to his whereabouts, an offence that carries a penalty of two years suspension. Alberto Contador Alberto Contador was not allowed to start in the 2006 Tour de France due to his possible involvement with the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case in which he had been referred to by key persons who were the subject of investigation. He was subsequently cleared and allowed to start in 2007, going on to win the Tour. Contador signed a commitment in which he stated: \\"I am not involved in the Puerto affair nor in any other doping case\\". But according to documents obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde, he was still involved in the Puerto affair and therefore should not have been allowed to start the 2007 Tour. Since Contador was the only rider able to stay with Rasmussen on two arduous stages in the Alps and Pyrenees, several journalists focused on his relationship with Eufemiano Fuentes and his role in Operaci√≥n Puerto, without uncovering new evidence. Contador was tested five times during the Tour, and no discrepancies were reported. After the Tour, German doping expert Werner Franke, who had complete access to Puerto documents, accused him of having taken drugs in the past. On August 10, in response to increasing suspicion about links to the Operaci√≥n Puerto blood-doping ring alleged by Franke, Alberto Contador publicly declared himself a clean rider: \\"I have never doped and I have never participated in an act of doping,\\" said Contador, reading from a prepared statement. \\"I won the Tour clean. I cannot understand the attacks against by people that don't even know me. My commitment is absolute and I will always be ready to collaborate in the fight against doping.\\" Contador was joined by Discovery Channel team manager Johan Bruyneel, Spanish sports minister Jaime Lissavetzky and members of his family. Contador failed tests for clenbuterol in the 2010 Tour de France and was subsequently suspended from cycling for two years. Other developments In addition to the sacking and resignations of a number of riders (see above) it was announced on 31 July that Team Astana had suspended team activities for one month, stating that: \\"Following recent events, we have decided to stop our activities until the end of August...This period of time will be the opportunity for deep questioning.\\" and two weeks after the Tour had finished it emerged that team-rider Andrej Kashechkin had also failed doping tests. The Astana team were later banned from entering the next Grand Tour of the season, the 2007 Vuelta a Espa√±a (or Tour of Spain) as a direct result of the failed doping tests of three of the team's riders. On 3 August Team Rabobank's general director, Theo de Rooij announced his resignation from the team as a consequence of the events. Both Michael Rasmussen and Alberto Contador were excluded from the Hamburg Cyclassics race later in the month after the Tour due to continuing allegations linking both riders to doping. As well as the international media, professional riders and sponsors, a number of organisations involved with the Tour and professional cycling made statements about the future of the sport and the impact of doping. The Discovery Channel Team subsequently announced they would be disbanding at the end of the 2007 season citing the \\"situation in the sport\\" at the time as one of the factors in their failure to find new sponsors. Later in the year T-Mobile confirmed they would withdraw from sponsoring professional cycling in order to distance themselves from doping scandals which included Patrik Sinkewitz's failed test result in the 2007 Tour and previous admissions of doping by former T-Mobile team riders including Bjarne Riis. In an interview broadcast in September 2007, president of the UCI Pat McQuaid referring to the Tour events, called for the then-current two-year ban for first-time doping offenders to be increased to a life ban in an effort to deter doping activity. The statement marked a shift in policy as the president had previously (during the Tour) expressed a belief that a two-year ban was sufficient. On February 13, 2008, the ASO announced that the Astana team, despite completely changing its ownership, management, and rider roster since the 2007 scandals, would be barred from the 2008 Tour due to its involvement in the 2007 scandals and its links to Operaci√≥n Puerto. The move meant that neither Contador, the 2007 winner, nor third-place Levi Leipheimer, both of whom signed with the revamped Astana setup, were able to compete in the 2008 tour.

This also applies to detainees presented before them by other public servants with power of arrest who may use the suite from time to time, for example Revenue & Customs officers and Immigration officers. The officer presents the arrested person to the custody officer and explains the circumstances of the arrest, with further detention of the person being authorised if the custody officer deems it necessary to do so. It is not the custody officer's duty to determine whether the arrest was lawful or not, Code G of PACE states that this duty rests on the arresting officer. The custody officer must ensure that during the whole time the person is detained at the custody suite, police officers and police staff who deal with the detained person adhere to the PACE Codes of Practice regarding the rights and treatment of persons arrested.

He was a vassal of the Mongols and exercised no real authority. History does not record his ultimate fate. Reign Dissolution of the Seljuk Sultanate into Turkish Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300. Masud II was the eldest son of Kaykaus II. He spent part of his youth as an exile in the Crimea and lived for a time in Constantinople, then the capital of the Byzantine Empire. He appears first in Anatolia in 1280 as a pretender to the throne. In 1284 the new Ilkhan Sultan Ahmad deposed and executed the Seljuq sultan Kaykhusraw III and installed Masud in his place.Claude Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey: a general survey of the material and spiritual culture and history, trans. J. Jones- Williams (New York: Taplinger, 1968), p. 294 Ahmad's successor, Arghun, divided the Seljuq lands and granted Konya and the western half of the kingdom to the deposed sultan's two young sons. Masud invaded with a small force, had the two boys killed, and established himself in the city in 1286.Cahen, Pre- Ottoman Turkey, p. 295 He led several campaigns against the emerging Turkmen principalities, the Beyliks, always on behalf of the Mongols and usually with Mongol troops. Notable among these is the expedition beginning late in 1286 against the Germiyanids. The Germiyanids were a warlike band of Turkmen ancestry, settled by the Seljuqs a generation before in southwestern Anatolia to keep the more unruly Turkmen nomads in check. Masud conducted the campaign under the tutelage of the vizier and elder statesman, Fakhr al-Din Ali. Though there were a few successes on the battlefield, the highly mobile Germiyanids remained a significant force in the region. Masud and his Mongol allies conducted similarly futile expeditions against the Karamanids and Eshrefids.Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey, pp. 296f In 1297 in an atmosphere characterized by intrigue and near constant revolt against the distant Ilkhan authority, both on the part of Mongol officers and local Turkmen potentates, the hapless Masud was implicated in a plot against the Ilkhanate. He was pardoned but deprived of his throne and confined in Tabriz.Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey, p. 300 He was replaced with Kayqubad III who soon became involved in a similar plot and was executed by Sultan Mahmud Ghazan. The impoverished Masud returned to the throne in 1303.Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey, p. 301 From about 1306 Masud, and the Seljuq Sultanate with him, disappears from the historical record. Although, latest findings in 2015 propose his grave has been identified in Samsun. According to Rustam Shukurov, Masud II \\"had dual Christian and Muslim identity, an identity which was further complicated by dual Turkic/Persian and Greek ethnic identity\\".

In 1957, Baraschi took part in the contest for the statue of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, which Communist authorities meant to place in front of Casa Sc√¢nteii, a newly built Socialist Realist structure in northern Bucharest.

In 1998, nine years after the 1989 Revolution, the Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ building was returned to its rightful owner; the Ministry of Culture had to take the statue into its patrimony, and subsequently moved it in front of a house where Caragiale lived once, on Maria Rosetti Street.

He officiated in the World Series in 1918, 1922, 1925, 1928 and 1934, serving as crew chief for the last two Series. He also worked the All-Star Game in 1934, calling balls and strikes for the game's second half. Early life and career Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Owens hoped to pursue a baseball career, but accidentally shot himself in the left hand while celebrating the Fourth of July in 1901; instead of staying at home and resting, he went to the sandlot game in which he had intended to play, and replaced the umpire who quit after an early dispute in the game. His family moved to Chicago the following year, and he continued to umpire games for 50 cents each; he soon raised his rate to $1 a game, and upon being noticed by minor league executive Al Tearney, became an umpire in major local contests for $5 a game. By age 17 he was offered a position on the staff of the Northern League at a monthly salary of $75, but minor league games proved more contentious than sandlot events, and he accumulated so many scars from various altercations that when he was hired by the NL, league president Harry Pulliam asked if Owens had been in a train wreck. In one instance, he called three straight strikes on a batter for Crookston to end a game when the team was mounting a comeback against visiting Winnipeg; the batter dropped his bat and got into a fight with Owens, whereupon a fan jumped from the stands, picked up the bat and hit Owens over the head. After local authorities began the process of bringing charges, the batter's father offered Owens $750 to drop the matter, and he agreed as the amount was double his annual salary. On another occasion, Owens was attacked at his hotel by a player who he had ejected in that day's game, after which the team had refused to replace him and forfeited to the local Fargo team; the player was arrested and suspended. Minor league career By mid-1903 Owens had moved to the Western League, and he joined the Missouri Valley League when the Western League reorganized in 1904. He acquired his nickname after a game in Pittsburg, Kansas in which an unpopular call instigated fans to begin throwing bricks from the stands, with one hitting Owens in the head; when he miraculously returned days later with no serious injury, a player named Charley Lyons gave him the nickname, which he said he found more acceptable than some other things he had been called. He moved on to the American Association in 1905‚Äì1906, then the Eastern League in 1907 before returning to the American Association from 1908 to 1912. After a 1906 game, local Minneapolis officials tried to get an injunction to overturn a call he made to end the contest, which brought on the ejections of seven Minneapolis Millers players. The next day, Owens was the target of fans throwing eggs and cabbages from the stands, and a mob followed him to his hotel, which they threatened to attack if he was not turned over; police had to evacuate him over the rooftops and to the railway station. In a 1908 game in Milwaukee, he fought off 50 fans after a game-ending decision before being rescued by police. Another Milwaukee incident saw a rescuing policeman get his finger bitten off. Major league career After briefly working in the NL in 1908, he had an offer from Pulliam to join the NL staff in 1909, but the offer fell through due to Pulliam's subsequent illness. Owens and fellow umpire Will Brennan were hurt during the first game of the August 20, 1912 double-header between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. Owens, who had started the game umpiring first base, had taken over home plate duties after Brennan's season-ending injury (a broken right kneecap and torn ligaments suffered during a fall while running to cover second base) in the first inning. Then, in the second inning, Owens was struck in the chest by a foul ball, tearing several rib ligaments and leaving him with a broken breast bone. His exit marked the first -- and so far only -- known time that two umpires left the same major league game due to injury. Brennan and Owens were both hospitalized overnight at St. John's hospital. Later in 1912, after Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss took exception to one of Owens's decisions, he had the umpire followed by a private detective and accused him of visiting gambling houses. The league released Owens to satisfy the Pirates owner, and Owens then worked in the International League (the renamed Eastern League) in 1913 before returning to the American Association in 1914‚Äì1915. American League president Ban Johnson hired him for the 1916 season, one year after the death of umpire Jack Sheridan. After his minor league experiences, the relatively calm environment cultivated by Johnson was a relief, and Owens only had few notable confrontations before retiring due to illness after 22 seasons umpiring in the AL. Notable games Owens is perhaps best known for umpiring the game of June 23, 1917, in which Babe Ruth was the starting pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Ruth walked the first batter for the Washington Senators in four pitches, and was promptly ejected by Owens for disputing his calls; Ruth was so incensed by the ejection that he punched Owens. Ernie Shore replaced Ruth as the Red Sox pitcher, and not only picked the runner off first base but went on to retire the next 26 Washington batters; long regarded as a perfect game by Shore for retiring 27 men without permitting anyone to reach base, the game is now officially regarded as a combined no-hitter by Ruth and Shore. Owens was also the home plate umpire on June 15, 1925 when the Philadelphia Athletics scored 13 runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, coming back from a 15-4 deficit to defeat the Cleveland Indians 17-15, and tying the major league record for the greatest deficit overcome to win a game. Death Owens died at age 64 in Chicago after suffering a heart attack at the wholesale meat distributor where he had worked as a salesman since leaving baseball. He was buried in Fairmount-Willow Hills Memorial Park in Willow Springs, Illinois.

The original building at 1509 Ponce de Leon housed the entire school of 140 students during the first two years. In 1973 the school purchased the adjoining property and added a high school program. Two additional buildings were constructed in 1977 to allow for increased enrollment and to provide improved facilities for existing programs. Additional buildings were purchased in the 1980s for classrooms, laboratories, and the upper school library. A new gym and theater complex was opened in 1989, and a 25,000-square-foot high school classroom building with library and computer facilities was opened in 1995. In 1999 renovations were completed on the Neel Reid house at 1341 Ponce de Leon Avenue, and a half-day program was moved there. Playing fields were opened in 1999 in Avondale Estates, and the Music and Art Center opened in the fall of 2001. With the start of the 2008-2009 school year, the school opened several new facilities for the junior high, physical education, drama and music programs built with money raised in the $25 million Campaign for All Ages. These facilities include a new junior high building, an expanded chorus program room, an expanded main gym, a multipurpose gym, a black box theater, art display area, a fitness center, an open green space and increased parking. Paideia School now has over 900 students from age three through 12th grade. The school is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Southern Association of Independent Schools. High school tuition for 2020-2021 was $27,429 per year.

This species was named for the British zoologist William Alexander Forbes.  Identification  Forbes's Blackbird is an average sized icterid around 21‚Äì24 cm with all black, non-glossy feathers. It has a slender, arrow-shaped bill with a straight culmen, equal to the length of its head. It has a long, slender tail with rounded feathers. As a perching bird it has an anisodactyl toe arrangement with three toes facing forward and one back. It has a harsh and buzzy call and chatters. It is often mistaken for the Chopi Blackbird (Gnorimopsar chopi), which can be distinguished by its glossy feathers and a distinct curve in the culmen of the beak.  Life History  Forbes's Blackbird had an average lifespan of 4.6 years. It can eat insects, fruit and occasionally nectar from flowering plants or sugarcane. Its breeding season ranges from March to June, during the rainy season. Nests are most commonly found in mango trees (Mangifera indica). Egg clutch sizes can range between 1-4 eggs and it can have up to two clutches during the breeding season. After nest completion it can take anywhere between 4 and 10 days until egg laying starts. It is estimated that the population does not exceed 10,000 mature individuals.  Habitat and Range  Forbes's Blackbird is a non-migratory species found in east and north-east Brazil in small and very fragmented habitats. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, and plantations. The largest grouping found 150 individuals at Pedra Talhada, Alagoas. There are anywhere between 2-100 subpopulations, all of which are experiencing a continued decline of mature individuals. It has been found in small numbers around sugar cane plantations and pastures adjacent to forest patches and marshy areas. In the wild it primarily inhabits forest edge areas.  Threats  The greatest threat to Forbes's Blackbird is widespread habitat destruction and degradation. It is estimated that roughly 10% of forest from the species range was lost between 2000‚Äì2012. The degradation has even reduced the amount of forest edge habitat available. Much of the destroyed forest has been converted to sugar cane plantations which the local populations may be able to withstand. Decline in population size has also been attributed to reduced reproductive success due to brood parasitism from the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis). Nests observed from 1981-1986 has a parasitism rate of 64%, and in 1987 all nests studied were parasitized by the Shiny Cowbird. It has also been observed in trade due to confusion with the Chopi Blackbird which is valued in trade.  Conservation  Forbes's blackbird is officially recognized as vulnerable in Brazil. It is legally protected in Rio Doce State Park and Pedra Telhada Biological Reserve where protection is enforced by guards, however the species mostly occur outside these areas.

It is found in Central America, where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest. There are two subspecies, C. m. melanocyaneus which is found in Guatemala and southern El Salvador, and C. m. chavezi from Honduras and northeastern Nicaragua. Description The adult bushy-crested jay has a length of . The tail is long and the central feathers are graduated. The sexes look alike; the head, neck, breast and upper mantle are black while the remaining upper parts are dark blue with a sheen of green or violet. The underparts are plain greenish-blue, the undersides of the wings are grey and the underside of the tail is blackish. The head bears a stubble-like erectile crown of feathers, the beak is black and relatively small, the irises are yellow and the legs black. Distribution and habitat Keulemans, 1877 This jay is native to Central America where it is found in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua at altitudes between about . Its habitat is humid forests, especially those with pine and oak, forest verges, glades and areas of scrub. It adapts well to degradation of its habitat and has become common in coffee plantations and around agricultural land. Ecology The species is social and lives in small groups. These forage in the lower storey of trees and in the undergrowth, often descending to the ground to search through the leaf litter. The diet consists of invertebrates, seeds, nuts and fruits. The nest is built in dense undergrowth out of twigs and lined with plant fibres. One female lays a clutch of three or four eggs in late April or early May. Another female shares the incubation of the eggs with her, and many birds assist with the feeding of the young. In one nest, eleven different adults helped feed the brood, as well as some juveniles that had hatched earlier. Status C. melanocyaneus seems to be adaptable and is coping with the degradation of its natural environment by moving to manmade habitats such as coffee plantations and cropland. It has a wide range and the population is thought to be increasing, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a species of least concern.

It is endemic to Mexico where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests; it is a common species and has been rated as \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN. Description The adult San Blas jay is between long and weighs between . The sexes are similar; the adult has back, rump, wings and tail blue and the remaining plumage black. There is a small crest on the front of the head, the bill is black, the irises are white and the legs are black. The juveniles are similar apart from a larger crest, a yellow bill and brown eyes. Distribution This jay is endemic to Mexico. There are two subspecies; C. s. nelsoni is found in southwestern Mexico, from Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima southward to western Guerrero; and C. s. sanblasianus is found in the coastal region of Guerrero. The habitat includes dry and semi- moist woodland, thickets, groves and plantations as well as mangrove areas. This bird is not found deep in the forest. Ecology The species is social, living in small groups of up to thirty individuals including six to ten breeding pairs. These occupy a large territory but have little interaction with neighbouring groups. The birds seem to have stable pair bonds and most start breeding at three years old. The nests are grouped socially in trees, vines or shrubs, often in the crowns of palm trees. Each is constructed of twigs and lined with soft plant material, and a clutch of up to four mottled eggs is laid. Non-breeding females sometimes take short turns at incubation, which takes about eighteen days. Both parents care for the young, and several birds may help feed the chicks, especially after they have fledged. The San Blas jay is omnivorous, the birds feeding both on the ground and in the lower parts of trees. The diet consists of insects and other invertebrates, fruit and small vertebrates such as lizards. This bird has been observed taking nestlings from the nest of a ruddy ground dove (Columbina talpacoti).

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and heavily degraded former forest. This species is mainly a lowland bird although locally this jay may variously range to elevations as high as 500‚Äì1,400 m. Description perched in the rain in eastern Ecuador This is a medium-large jay with dull violet- blue plumage and a striking dark face and throat. The purplish jay (with which it overlaps in southeastern Peru and in northern Bolivia) is duller (more purplish or brownish blue, less violaceous blue) and the nape is not paler than the back. In eastern Colombia and southern Venezuela, the azure-naped jay is distinguished by its pale iris, white undertail coverts and tip to the tail, paler nape, and short frontal crest. The violaceous jay is 33‚Äì38 cm (13‚Äì15 in) long and weighs 262 grams (9.2 oz.) Behavior The violaceous jay is omnivorous, mainly consuming fruits, insects, and bird and reptile eggs. It is also known to take small lizards as well. Little is known in any detail about the violaceous jay's life history. Violaceous jays in Venezuela forage chiefly in the middle and upper canopy (above 18 meters) in a mature tropical evergreen rainforest. They take food items by hopping along limbs and gleaning for prey. It forages in flocks in forest canopy, and rarely lingers in one spot for long. These flocks often are noisy, but like other jays, the violaceous jay can be quiet and inconspicuous at times. They are known to frequently mob potential predators. Distribution The range of the violaceous jay is the southwest and northwest Amazon Basin, from northern Bolivia, through Amazonian eastern Peru and Ecuador, Amazonian Colombia, and the Orinoco River Basin and beyond into northern Venezuela. The range is east of the Andes cordillera, except in the north in Colombia and Venezuela. In southwest Guyana, (the southwest Guiana Shield), the range borders Roraima state, Brazil and the Amazon River, (Rio Negro), tributary, the south-flowing Branco River of central Roraima. In Brazil's western Amazon Basin, the violaceous jay is found in Roraima, Amazonas, and Acre state, the west of North Region, Brazil.

It is in the monotypic genus Cyanolanius. It is found in Comoros, Madagascar, and Mayotte, where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest.  Taxonomy and systematics  In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the blue vanga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. He used the French name Le pie-griesche bleu de Madagascar and the Latin Lanius Madagascariensis coeruleus. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the blue vanga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Loxia madagascarina and cited Brisson's work. The species is now placed in the genus Cyanolanius that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. A taxon found on the Comoros Islands, the Comoro blue vanga is considered by most authorities to be a subspecies of the blue vanga (C. m. comorensis), though it has occasionally been considered a separate species, Cyanolanius comorensis.  Subspecies  Three subspecies are recognised: * C. m. madagascarinus (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì Found in northern, eastern, and western Madagascar. * C. m. comorensis (Shelley, 1894) ‚Äì It is found on Moh√©li in the Comoro Islands. It tends to be larger than madagarensis and is also exhibits slight differences in colour. * C. m. bensoni Louette & Herremans, 1982 ‚Äì It is found on Grande Comore in the Comoro Islands. It is described from only a single immature specimen, and looks very similar to comorensis. Doubts have been cast on whether it is a distinctive taxon.  Description  Adult male blue vanga. The bird is 16‚Äì19 cm long, weighing 19.5-25.5 g. Adult males are bright blue in color, with a black line through the eye which extends to base of the bill, as well as above and below the bill. It has a paler blue eye-ring. The tail as well as edges and tips of the wings are black in colour. The underparts and throat are bright white in colour. Females tend to be slightly duller in colour than males, with the underparts also being off-white in colour with a pale orange or light buffy wash. The wings are slightly tinged greenish. Juveniles have a grayish-blue head, with the rest of the upperparts being dark greenish olive. Their tail is similar in appearance to an adult female's, but has a duller green-blue pattern. The throat is dirty-white in colour, the rest of the underparts being olive-buff. Colours of bare parts vary according to subspecies. C. m. madagarensis has a vivid pale or cold blue beak, with a dark tip and cutting edges in adult males, and a dark brown with similar pattern in adult female. Juveniles have a black bill with pale pink base. The iris is sky-blue or greenish blue in males, and brown in females and juveniles. The legs are black in male and gray in females. C. m. comorensis has a ultramarine blue beak with a black tip in males and a dark brown tip in females. The iris is pale blue in adults, while the legs and feet are black or dark slate in colour.  Vocalisations  Calls are described as a very characteristic 'tcccch', which is sometimes repeated to form a 'chrr-crrk-crrk-crrrrk-crk- crk', similar to the Chabert vanga's call. The song can be faster or slower, and the first note is usually of a higher pitch. They also make 'teea teea teea' or a harsh 'scheet', which is thought to be an alarm call. Race comorensis has similar calls, but also makes a grating 'erch-chhh-crkk-chh- chhh-chhh-crrk' or a less softer 'crew-crew-crew'.  Behaviour and ecology   Diet  Mainly feeds on insects, including beetles, Orthoptera, cicadas, caterpillars, as well as spiders. They also occasionally feed upon berries. Birds on Moh√©li have been recorded eating fruit. It forages in the middle and upper levels of trees. Feeding often occurs while hanging upside down from its feet. Most food is gleaned from the substrate, and it also sally-gleans from branches and leaves. It usually forages in groups of up to 6 birds n the non- breeding season, and in pairs while nesting. It has also been observed foraging in mixed-species flocks throughout its range.  Breeding  The breeding season is thought to be from October-December. Juveniles are taken care of by both sexes. The observed nests were placed around 12 m above the ground, near a fork between near-vertical, slender branches. The nest is cup- shaped, and made out of fine twigs and a pale down-like material. Eggs are pale blue to green and have mid-sized lilac-gray to red-brown speckles, which ate the densest at the larger end. They are 19.9‚Äì21.2 √ó 15.8‚Äì16.2 mm in size.  Distribution  The species is found in northern, eastern, and western Madagascar, as well as on the islands of Grand Comore and Moh√©li in the Comoros Islands. It inhabits the midstory and canopy of deciduous dry forests in the western part of its range, and evergreen humid forest in the west. It has also been observed in littoral forests, the adjacent second growth, and even in mangroves. It occurs up to an elevation of 1,200 m, although it has been reported up to elevations of 1,600 m. It inhabits a variety of woodland on the Comoros Islands. It is known to inhabits habitats above an elevation of 300 m on Moh√©li. On Grand Comore, it is mainly known from degraded forest patches with banana cultivation on the slopes of Mount Karthala at an elevation of 700-900 m.  Status  The nominate race on Madagascar faces few threats due to its large range and population. it is classified by the IUCN Red List as least concern. However, the subspecies on the Comoros Islands are threatened by a limited range, deforestation and habitat loss, and degradation of the habitat due to invasive plant species like Syzygium jambos, Lantana camara and Clidemia hirta.

It is found in the Talamancan montane forests of Costa Rica and western Panama. The IUCN has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description The silvery-throated jay is a distinctive small jay, unlikely to be confused with any other bird found within its range. The sexes are similar, with the adult being about in length including the long tail. The head is black with a narrow but obvious white supercilium, and it bears an inconspicuous crest of short stiff feathers on the forehead. The throat and breast are silvery-white, sometimes with a violet sheen. The mantle, neck and sides of breast are black which gradually blends into the dark purplish-blue of the rest of the plumage. The upper surfaces of the wings and tail are a brighter, paler shade of blue and the undersides are blackish. The irises are deep red and the bill and legs are black. The plumage of the juvenile is duller and lacks the white on the head. Ecology A sociable bird, it moves through the upper parts of the forest canopy in groups of four to ten. Outside the breeding season, larger groups of up to thirty may form, and they tend to roost communally, settling down for the night with much chatter. When foraging, they move methodically through the crowns of trees, searching in crevices and probing into mosses, lichens and other epiphytes.

It is found in Middle America. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. This species is known to have four subspecies. It is in length and is dark blue with a black head and upper chest. The back of the head and neck are sky blue with a white border. The jays travel in groups of two to ten individuals and may join mixed-species flocks. It is a secretive species and therefore difficult to observe in the wild. As an omnivore, this jay eats berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. Females lay three to four eggs, and the young fledge after twenty days. This species is listed as Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened with extinction. Taxonomy The species was first described by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1885. Its specific epithet, cucullata, is the Latin word for \\"hooded\\". Its closest relative is the beautiful jay (C. pulchra) of Colombia and Ecuador;Goodwin, p. 258 in his 1934 study, Hellmayr treated these species as conspecific. Phylogenetic analysis published in 2009 confirmed the close relationship between the two species; Bonaccorso speculates that the geographic (and subsequent genetic) separation between these species and others in the genus Cyanolyca may have been initiated by the formation of the R√≠o Cauca Valley in western Colombia. The azure-hooded jay has four subspecies. Cyanolyca cucullata mitrata is found in eastern Mexico, from San Luis Potos√≠ to north central Oaxaca. This subspecies was initially treated as a separate species by Ridgway, but it was later merged into the azure-hooded jay. C. c. guatemalae ranges from southern Mexico in Chiapas to central Guatemala. C. c. hondurensis resides in western Honduras. C. c. cucullata, the nominate subspecies, is found in Costa Rica and western Panama. Description In Costa Rica The azure-hooded jay ranges in length from , and it tends to weigh . Its large size and frame help the bird manage the large amount of flying it does. The adult is dark blue with black on the head and upper chest, while the rear of the crown and nape, or back of the neck, are sky blue with a white border. The legs and bill are black and the eyes are dark red. Both sexes are similar in appearance. Juveniles are duller than adults and their sky blue hood does not possess the white bordering. Its voice has been described as a loud and bright eihnk-eihnk that is typically repeated four to five times. It is also known to repeat a nasal ehr-ehn or eh‚Äôenk noise twice and give off a low, gruff, hard cheh-r. The alarm and flock-social calls of this species, characterized as a reek! sound, are \\"nasal, querulous, and upwardly or double inflected.\\" Distribution and habitat Costa Rica's Monteverde cloud forest, which the azure-hooded jay inhabits This species is known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. It lives in humid evergreen forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It can be found at the edges of these forests typically in the middle and higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where cloud forest is uninterrupted. Ecology and behavior This corvid is known to join mixed-species flocks with other species including unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other azure-hooded jays. It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming out into the open. Because of this habit, the bird is extremely difficult to observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over in front of the other and tugging on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement. Like other jays, this species is likely extremely intelligent. Similar species are known to use ants to keep their feathers clean, store seeds and nuts for later consumption, and use their toes to hold food. However, due to its secretive nature, these characteristics have not yet been observed in the species. The bird's bright plumage makes it easy for predators to find this species. Whenever the jay feels threatened, it gives off a warning alarm call. Diet The azure- hooded jay is omnivorous, eating berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. This species has been known to steal and eat bait from traps set for small mammals. The bird tends to forage in the forest canopy. Reproduction The jay's nest is typically built above the ground next to a tree trunk. The base of the azure-hooded jay's first studied nest was coarsely made out of twigs that were long. That nest was about wide inside and wide overall depending on the length of the exterior twigs. The nest is deep and has an interior constructed with woven thin fibrils and twigs, and no feathers or other softening devices are used in the nest's construction. In addition to building its own nest, this jay is known to reuse old, abandoned nests made by other species. Three to four eggs are normally laid. The young are typically raised in the nest between April and June and they take at least 20 days to fledge. Both parents care for the young and feed them a variety of insects, including katydids. After the young fledge, they stay close to their parents. Conservation This jay is treated as a species of Least Concern, or not threatened with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , population which, while unsurveyed, is believed to be above 10,000 individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. However, the azure-hooded jay is uncommon in some parts of its range. It is also believed that deforestation may have an effect on this bird. Relationship with humans Although this species has not been observed doing this, closely related jays are known to destroy and eat human-planted crops such as orchards, cane, pineapples, and potatoes. The azure-hooded jay has appeared on one stamp in Mexico in 1996.

Gholson and \\"Polly\\" Mary Jarrell. He settled on Humphrey's Creek in the area of Lovelaceville, Kentucky, which had been recently settled by Andrew Lovelace in 1820. He was married in Hickman County, Kentucky, to Mary Jane Morrison Martin on April 15, 1826. Gholson studied law and became a lawyer with a practice in Kentucky. He served as a captain with the U.S. Volunteers during the war with Mexico. On June 26, 1846, he was appointed Assistant Commissary of Subsistence, U.S. Volunteers, with the rank of captain. On July 31, 1846, he accepted that appointment at Paducah, Kentucky, US. On August 26, 1846, he joined the 2nd Kentucky Infantry and served in the Mexican War. In October 1846, he was known to be at Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas, US. In December 1846, he was at Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas, US. On June 30, 1847, he was honourably discharged from military service. His experience during the war with Mexico led him to purchase a sizable ranch in Texas, in addition to his substantial land holdings in Kentucky. He could not convince his wife to move to the Texas frontier. He was a member of the Kentucky State Senate from 1851 to 1855 and represented Ballard and McCracken Counties in the framing of a new constitution for Kentucky. Gholson was an ardent supporter of President James Buchanan and campaigned throughout the state of Kentucky for him in his race for president. Buchanan later appointed him governor of the Washington Territory, and he served from July 1859 until 1861 when he resigned and returned to Kentucky due to the unrest that led up to the Civil War. At the onset of the Civil War, Gholson moved from Kentucky across the state line into Tennessee \\"for greater protection of his family and slaves.\\" This was apparently a fairly common practice during that time. The Woodville Cavalry, Woodville, McCracken County, Kentucky, was commissioned on April 23, 1861. Its officers were: R. D. Gholson, captain; W. W. Faulkner, first lieutenant; R. S. Hill, second lieutenant; and W. S. Gholson, third lieutenant. Gholson died in Troy, Tennessee, on August 23, 1862. His death resulted from injuries suffered from being thrown against a tree by a runaway team of horses pulling a wagon. Some believe that his body was taken back to Kentucky for burial, while others believe he was buried on his Texas ranch, but the burial spot remains unknown. For over a century it was believed that no portrait of Gholson existed. In 2006, Jewell Dunn, a volunteer at the Washington State Archives located Gholson family members who had chalk pastel portrait of Gholson. An electronic image of the portrait is available online at the Washington State Digital Archives.http://digitalarchives.wa.gov/ViewRecord.aspx?RID=0BD321C99D6F6C3BFFC2C81549EABD21 His wife Mary died in Ballard County, Kentucky, on October 19, 1883. Family correspondence suggest that Gholson and his wife had eleven children. Census records suggests they may have had as many as 13 children: # Mary Agnes Gholson, born April 23, 1827 # Frederick Martin Gholson, born April 10, 1829 # Daniel Burdine Gholson, born September 21, 1831 (Twin child) # Elizabeth Angelline Gholson, born September 21, 1831 (Twin child) # Richard Dickerson Gholson, born March 13, 1834 # Phoebe Jane Gholson, born March 6, 1837 # William Samuel Gholson, born September 29, 1839 # Susan Frances Gholson, born September 30, 1842 # Sarah Gholson, born February 22, 1844 # Marguerite L.

The turquoise jay is a vibrant blue jay with a black face mask and collar. It is found exclusively in South America throughout southern Colombia, Ecuador, and northern Peru. The turquoise jay prefers a humid habitat of montane evergreen forest and elfin forest with both primary and secondary growth. This bird is omnivorous and is known to eat insects, berries, eggs, and young birds of other species. Turquoise jays are nonmigratory and tend to travel in mixed flocks. Taxonomy Order and family The order Passeriformes, commonly referred to as ‚Äúperching birds,‚Äù is perhaps the largest and most diverse order of birds. These birds are found worldwide, excluding Antarctica, but have their highest concentration in the tropics. Their sizes range from just a few grams to over a kilogram in weight, and they are generally colorful songbirds. The family Corvidae is in the order Passeriformes and includes the jays, magpies, and crows. Most of the birds are strongly built, are stout-billed, and are some of the largest birds in Passeriformes. In most cases there exists no sexual dimorphism. Corvids have loud, harsh voices and an advanced social organization. Individuals in a colony will take care of one another and generally a pair will mate for life. Corvids can be destructive; often they rob nests and ruin crops, however they are extremely intelligent and are resourceful scavengers. There are over 120 known species in the family Corvidae. Related species Similar species include the beautiful jay, the black-collared jay, and the white-collared jay. The turquoise jay is sympatric with the black-collared jay; both inhabit northwestern South America, though the black-collared jay is less green in color and has a much longer tail. The white-collared jay is also prevalent in northwestern South America, but differs in appearance from the turquoise jay by a white forecrown, black undertail, thin white collar, and general darker blue color. The beautiful jay is a rare jay that exists only on a thin strip of the western Andes between Colombia and Ecuador. It is different from the turquoise jay by a darker color overall, smaller size, and the absence of a black collar. The turquoise jay has no subspecies. Guango Lodge, Ecuador Description There exists no sexual dimorphism within the species. Adult turquoise jays are mainly a vibrant, blue-green color that can change depending on the lighting. The underside of the wings and tail are black. The turquoise jay has a thick, black face mask that extends to the auriculars and connects to a thin, black collar the wraps around the throat but does not extend around the nape of the neck. The forecrown of the turquoise jay is very light and almost white in color. The iris of the bird is brown while the legs, feet, and bill are all black. Juveniles have a duller color overall and lack the thin, black collar. Measurements: * Total Length: 32 cm * Wing Length: 137 mm * Tail Length: 142 mm * Bill Length: 34 mm * Tarsus Length: 39 mm The primary vocalization of the turquoise jay is a short, descending whistle that is often heard in series. The tone of the whistle is loud and slightly hissy. Other sounds the turquoise jay can make include popping, squeaking, hissing, and static noises. Distribution and habitat The turquoise jay is endemic to South America. It is found along the western Andes Mountains from southern Colombia to northern Peru, mostly at elevations between 2000‚Äì3000 feet, depending on the country; in Colombia, the turquoise jay is normally found between 2600‚Äì3000 feet, while in Ecuador it is found at elevations as low as 2000 feet. This bird prefers humid environments with densely tangled trees and shrubs and forests with primary or secondary growth. The turquoise jay is found in tall, montane evergreen forest and short elfin forest with thick vegetation. It is also found in semi-degraded habitats. The conservation status of this bird is rated ‚Äúleast concern‚Äù because the populations in its geographic range are relatively stable. This bird is considered common within its geographic range. Behavior Diet The turquoise jay is omnivorous. Though little is known about the diet, the jay is confirmed to eat insects, berries, eggs, and the young of other birds. Like other jays, the turquoise jay will explore the midstory and canopy of trees in search of food, examining the vegetation along the way. Breeding Little is known about the breeding habits of turquoise jays. The nests are generally constructed of moss and are built in the forks of branches near the crowns of trees. The areas in which nests are found are generally isolated and located centrally in the tree. Multiple individuals build the nest and care for the young. The male will generally feed and care for the female while she is incubating the eggs. References Keulemans, 1877 * The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Cyanolyca turcosa *Britannica: Academic Edition.

Biography Zuo was born to an aristocratic family of Confucian scholars in Linzi. His mother died young. His father, Zuo Yong, was promoted to imperial official in charge of the imperial archives. Zuo Si would often play word games with his sister, Zuo Fen, who later became famous in her own right as a writer and a concubine of Emperor Wu of Jin. Literary works In approximately 280, Zuo wrote the \\"Shu Capital Rhapsody\\" (), the first of his rhapsodies on the three capitals of the Three Kingdoms Period. The Shu Capital Rhapsody described the city of Chengdu and the surrounding area. This work features the earliest surviving reference to Mount Emei. The work was so highly renowned and frequently copied upon its release that the price of paper in Luoyang is said to have risen as a result. This later gave rise to the popular Chinese idiom Ê¥õÈò≥Á∫∏Ë¥µ (\\"Paper is Expensive in Luoyang\\"), today used to praise a literary work. Zuo described his rhapsodies on the three capitals as derivative of similar works by Zhang Heng and Ban Gu. However, Mark Edward Lewis has written that Zuo's rhapsodies marked the end of the Han Dynasty ideal of the ritually perfect capital, because they describe three simultaneously existing, contemporary capitals, suppressing the ritual and historical evolution that structured the previous works. Zuo argued for accuracy as the basis of poetry, in contrast to the fantastic writings of Han poets. In his preface to the three rhapsodies, he wrote that while writers of lyric verse \\"sing of what their hearts are set upon\\", writers of descriptive rhapsodies \\"praise what they observe\\". Zuo's poetry, particularly his poem Summoning the Recluse, is regarded as representative of the medieval Chinese \\"poetry of seclusion\\" or \\"poetry of the recluse\\". Unlike earlier poems, which encouraged readers to leave the wilderness for the official life, Zuo advocates a return to the wilderness. Gaul and Hiltz attribute this change in perspective to the replacement of Shamanistic beliefs with Confucian ethics and Daoist religion. Legacy Zuo Si's work has continued to be resonate with later scholars. The Qing Dynasty scholar Yuan Mei wrote that Zuo Si's Singing of History \\"uses past deeds of historical characters to express what is in one's own heart\\", and is an example of the first of the three types of historical verse. The Tang Dynasty poet Wang Ji paid homage uses Zuo's Summoning the Recluse as a model, but departs from it by focusing on the recluse's way of life, rather than the natural surroundings. In addition, unlike Zuo, Wang does not completely abandon the pursuit of honor and glory in officialdom.

Known for most of its length as Mapleville Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 40 Alternate (US 40 Alternate) in Boonsboro north to MD 64 near Smithsburg. MD 66 parallels the western flank of South Mountain in eastern Washington County, connecting Boonsboro and Smithsburg with Interstate 70 (I-70) and US 40. MD 66 was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s from Boonsboro to Cavetown. The state highway was extended north through Smithsburg after MD 64 bypassed the town in the late 1950s. Route description View north along MD 66 in Boonsboro MD 66 begins at an intersection with US 40 Alternate (Main Street) near the Bowman House in Boonsboro.

The remainder of MD 66 was paved starting from Boonsboro in 1925. By 1927, the highway was paved north to Beaver Creek. In 1928, MD 66 was extended north to Mount Aetna. The state highway was completed to Chewsville Road in 1929. The final segment of MD 66 south of Cavetown was completed in 1933. Following the completion of MD 64's bypass of Cavetown and Smithsburg in 1958, MD 66 was extended north through Smithsburg over MD 64's old alignment. MD 66 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway at I-70 concurrent with the construction of the highway's interchange with I-70 in 1968. The roundabout at the intersection with Mount Aetna Road was constructed in 2002.

The species is found in Central and Southern America. Taxonomy and systematics The species is very closely related to the bamboo antshrike, and the two have previously been considered to be the same species. As the entire range of that species is shared with the fasciated antshrike, however, the two are now treated as two species. The fasciated antshrike has three subspecies, ' the nominate subspecies, C. l. lineatus , C. l. fasciatus (Ridgway, 1884) and C. l. intermedius (Hartert & Goodson, 1917).Zimmer, K. & Isler, M.L. (2017). Fasciated Antshrike (Cymbilaimus lineatus). In: del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., Sargatal, J., Christie, D.A. & de Juana, E. (eds.). Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. (retrieved from http://www.hbw.com/node/56646 on 13 March 2017). Distribution and range It is found from eastern Honduras down to Colombia, the Amazon Basin and the Guyanas. Its natural habitat tropical moist lowland forests, in tangled and dense vegetation in the mid-story of the forest. It is more common in secondary forest in Central America. It is usually found below and rarely up to . Where its range overlaps with that of the bamboo antshrike it is found at lower elevations than that species. Description The fasciated antshrike is a large antbird, long and weighing . The plumage varies by sex (sexual dimorphism), with the male being black with white barring across the whole body. The barring is very faint on the crown and becomes more even further down the body. The crown is rufous on the female, and the rest of the body is brown bared with faint yellow-brown, become yellow-brown barred with brown further down the body. The bill is large and hooked. The fasciated antshrike makes a variety off calls, including lazy plaintive whistles and a rattle-like chatter. Behaviour Diet and feeding The fasciated antshrike feeds on large insects and other prey in the mid-story, from off the ground. It particularly feeds on vine clusters and near tree trunks, but will also come down to the forest floor on occasion. Insects taken include grasshoppers, bugs, beetles and caterpillars, as well as spiders and even lizards, amphibians and occasionally fruit. They will join mixed species feeding flocks with antwrens and foliage-gleaners that pass through their territories, and will also follow army ants to take prey flushed by them, but they are not obligate ant-followers. Breeding Two creamy white eggs with variable patterning are laid in a simple cup nest of plant fibres placed off the ground. Both parents incubate the eggs during the day, only the female does so at night.

Another definition refers to image quality as \\"the weighted combination of all of the visually significant attributes of an image\\". The difference between the two definitions is that one focuses on the characteristics of signal processing in different imaging systems and the latter on the perceptual assessments that make an image pleasant for human viewers. Image quality should not be mistaken with image fidelity. Image fidelity refers to the ability of a process to render a given copy in a perceptually similar way to the original (without distortion or information loss), i.e., through a digitization or conversion process from analog media to digital image. The process of determining the level of accuracy is called Image Quality Assessment (IQA). Image quality assessment is part of the quality of experience measures. Image quality can be assessed using two methods: subjective and objective. Subjective methods are based on the perceptual assessment of a human viewer about the attributes of an image or set of images, while objective methods are based on computational models that can predict perceptual image quality. Objective and subjective methods aren't necessarily consistent or accurate between each other: a human viewer might perceive stark differences in quality in a set of images where a computer algorithm might not. Subjective methods are costly, require a large number of people, and are impossible to automate in real-time. Therefore, the goal of image quality assessment research is to design algorithms for objective assessment that are also consistent with subjective assessments. The development of such algorithms has a lot of potential applications. They can be used to monitor image quality in control quality systems, to benchmark image processing systems and algorithms and to optimize imaging systems.  Image quality factors  The image formation process is affected by several distortions between the moment in which the signals travel through to and reach the capture surface, and the device or mean in which signals are displayed. Although optical aberrations can cause great distorsions in image quality, they are not part of the field of Image Quality Assessment. Optical aberrations caused by lenses belong to the optics area and not to the signal processing areas. In an ideal model, there's no quality loss between the emission of the signal and the surface in which the signal is being captured on. For example, a digital image is formed by electromagnetic radiation or other waves as they pass through or reflect off objects. That information is then captured and converted into digital signals by an image sensor. The sensor, however, has nonidealities that limit its performance.  Image quality assessment methods  Image quality can be assessed using objective or subjective methods. In the objective method, image quality assessments are performed by different algorithms that analyze the distortions and degradations introduced in an image. Subjective image quality assessments are a method based on the way in which humans experience or perceive image quality. Objective and subjective methods of quality assessment don't necessarily correlate with each other. An algorithm might have a similar value for an image and its altered or degraded versions, while a subjective method might perceive a stark contrast in quality for the same image and its versions.  Subjective methods  See main article: Subjective video quality Subjective methods for image quality assessment belong to the larger area of psychophysics research, a field that studies the relationship between physical stimulus and human perceptions. A subjective IQA method will typically consist on applying mean opinion score techniques, where a number of viewers rate their opinions based on their perceptions of image quality. These opinions are afterwards mapped onto numerical values. These methods can be classified depending on the availability of the source and test images: *Single-stimulus: the viewer only has the test image and is not aware of the source image. *Double-stimulus: the viewer has both the source and test image. Since visual perception can be affected by environmental and viewing conditions, the International Telecommunications Union produced a set of recommendations for standardized testing methods for subjective image quality assessment.  Objective methods  Wang & Bovic (2006) classify the objective methods with the following criteria: (a) the availability of an original image; (b) on the basis of their application scopes and (c) on the model of a Human Visual System simulation to assess quality. Keelan (2002) classifies the methods based on (a) direct experimental measurements; (b) system modeling and (c) visual assessment against calibrated standards. * Full-reference (FR) methods ‚Äì FR metrics try to assess the quality of a test image by comparing it with a reference image that is assumed to have perfect quality, e.g. the original of an image versus a JPEG-compressed version of the image. * Reduced-reference (RR) methods ‚Äì RR metrics assess the quality of a test and reference image based on a comparison of features extracted from both images. * No-reference (NR) methods ‚Äì NR metrics try to assess the quality of a test image without any reference to the original one. Image quality metrics can also be classified in terms of measuring only one specific type of degradation (e.g., blurring, blocking, or ringing), or taking into account all possible signal distortions, that is, multiple kinds of artifacts.  Image quality attributes  Blown highlights are detrimental to image quality. Top: Original image. Bottom: Blown areas highlighted in red. At full resolution, this image has clearly visible compression artifacts, for example along the edges of the rightmost trusses. * Sharpness determines the amount of detail an image can convey. System sharpness is affected by the lens (design and manufacturing quality, focal length, aperture, and distance from the image center) and sensor (pixel count and anti-aliasing filter). In the field, sharpness is affected by camera shake (a good tripod can be helpful), focus accuracy, and atmospheric disturbances (thermal effects and aerosols). Lost sharpness can be restored by sharpening, but sharpening has limits. Oversharpening, can degrade image quality by causing \\"halos\\" to appear near contrast boundaries. Images from many compact digital cameras are sometimes oversharpened to compensate for lower image quality. * Noise is a random variation of image density, visible as grain in film and pixel level variations in digital images. It arises from the effects of basic physics‚Äî the photon nature of light and the thermal energy of heat‚Äî inside image sensors. Typical noise reduction (NR) software reduces the visibility of noise by smoothing the image, excluding areas near contrast boundaries. This technique works well, but it can obscure fine, low contrast detail. * Dynamic range (or exposure range) is the range of light levels a camera can capture, usually measured in f-stops, EV (exposure value), or zones (all factors of two in exposure). It is closely related to noise: high noise implies low dynamic range. * Tone reproduction is the relationship between scene luminance and the reproduced image brightness. * Contrast, also known as gamma, is the slope of the tone reproduction curve in a log-log space. High contrast usually involves loss of dynamic range ‚Äî loss of detail, or clipping, in highlights or shadows. * Color accuracy is an important but ambiguous image quality factor. Many viewers prefer enhanced color saturation; the most accurate color isn't necessarily the most pleasing. Nevertheless, it is important to measure a camera's color response: its color shifts, saturation, and the effectiveness of its white balance algorithms. * Distortion is an aberration that causes straight lines to curve. It can be troublesome for architectural photography and metrology (photographic applications involving measurement). Distortion tends to be noticeable in low cost cameras, including cell phones, and low cost DSLR lenses. It is usually very easy to see in wide angle photos. It can be now be corrected in software. * Vignetting, or light falloff, darkens images near the corners. It can be significant with wide angle lenses. * Exposure accuracy can be an issue with fully automatic cameras and with video cameras where there is little or no opportunity for post-exposure tonal adjustment. Some even have exposure memory: exposure may change after very bright or dark objects appear in a scene. * Lateral chromatic aberration (LCA), also called \\"color fringing\\", including purple fringing, is a lens aberration that causes colors to focus at different distances from the image center. It is most visible near corners of images. LCA is worst with asymmetrical lenses, including ultrawides, true telephotos and zooms. It is strongly affected by demosaicing. * Lens flare, including \\"veiling glare\\" is stray light in lenses and optical systems caused by reflections between lens elements and the inside barrel of the lens. It can cause image fogging (loss of shadow detail and color) as well as \\"ghost\\" images that can occur in the presence of bright light sources in or near the field of view. * Color moir√© is artificial color banding that can appear in images with repetitive patterns of high spatial frequencies, like fabrics or picket fences. It is affected by lens sharpness, the anti-aliasing (lowpass) filter (which softens the image), and demosaicing software. It tends to be worst with the sharpest lenses. * Artifacts ‚Äì software (especially operations performed during RAW conversion) can cause significant visual artifacts, including data compression and transmission losses (e.g. Low quality JPEG), oversharpening \\"halos\\" and loss of fine, low-contrast detail.

Standard hydrogen bonds are asymmetrical, with the hydrogen being associated with one heteroatom. When the pKa between the heteroatoms is equal, a symmetrical hydrogen bond forms with the hydrogen in equilibrium between two locations. At shorter distances, the barrier between the two energy minima is low enough that the hydrogen is equally bound as a low-barrier, or single-well hydrogen bond. A Low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) is a special type of hydrogen bond. LBHBs can occur when the pKa of the two heteroatoms are closely matched, which allows the hydrogen to be more equally shared between them. This hydrogen-sharing causes the formation of especially short, strong hydrogen bonds.  Description  In this aza crown-type, macrocyclic compound, a proton sits between two amide carbonyl oxygens separated by a distance of 2.45 √Ö. Standard hydrogen bonds are longer (e.g. 2.8 √Ö for an O¬∑¬∑¬∑O h-bond), and the hydrogen ion clearly belongs to one of the heteroatoms. When pKa of the heteroatoms is closely matched, a LBHB becomes possible at a shorter distance (~2.55 √Ö). When the distance further decreases (< 2.29 √Ö) the bond is characterized as a single-well or short-strong hydrogen bond.  Proteins  Low barrier hydrogen bonds occur in the water-excluding environments of proteins. Multiple residues act together in a charge-relay system to control the pKa values of the residues involved. LBHBs also occur on the surfaces of proteins, but are unstable due to their proximity to bulk water, and the conflicting requirements of strong salt-bridges in protein- protein interfaces.  Enzyme catalysis  Low-barrier hydrogen bonds have been proposed to be relevant to enzyme catalysis in two types of circumstance. Firstly, a low-barrier hydrogen bond in a charge relay network within an active site could activate a catalytic residue (e.g. between acid and base within a catalytic triad). Secondly, the formation of a LBHB could form during catalysis to stabilise a transition state (e.g. with substrate transition state in an oxyanion hole). Both of these mechanisms are contentious, with theoretical and experimental evidence split on whether they occur. Since the 2000s, the general consensus has been that LBHBs are not used by enzymes to aid catalysis. However, in 2012, a low-barrier hydrogen bond has been proposed to be involved in phosphate-arsenate discrimination for a phosphate transport protein. This finding might indicate the possibility of low-barrier hydrogen bonds playing a catalytic role in ion size selection for some very rare cases.

Named after counties in Michigan, Missouri, Utah, and Wisconsin, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-840 by the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania on 28 September 1944; launched on 15 November, sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Doerr; and commissioned on 11 December with Lieutenant David McC. Bon in command. Service history World War II, 1944-1946 Following shakedown off Florida, LST-840 loaded cargo at Gulfport, Mississippi, then sailed on 14 January 1945 for the Pacific. Additional cargo stops were made at San Francisco and Seattle before departing for the Marshall Islands; she arrived at Eniwetok on 24 March. After preparations in the Marshall and Caroline Islands, the landing ship departed Ulithi on 12 April for Okinawa. The battle for this strategic island, which lay at the gateway to the Japanese homeland, was well underway when LST-840 arrived on the 18th. She unloaded combat engineers and equipment, then returned Ulithi on 5 May. 5 August the ship dropped off 500 tons of bombs at Iwo Jima and secured 25 Japanese pow's from the U.S. Marines and delivered them to Guam. For the remainder of World War II, she shuttled troops and cargo throughout the American staging areas in the Pacific. After V-J Day, LST-840 operated with U.S. occupation forces in Japan and Okinawa for the next three months. Embarking 500 marines at Guam, she departed on 11 November en route to Pearl Harbor and the United States. Arriving at San Diego on 15 December, she remained on the West Coast until she decommissioned at Vancouver, Washington on 1 June 1946, joining the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Korean War, 1950-1953 In the effort to stop Communist aggression in South Korea, veteran ships were called out of reserve to provide support for the U.N. forces in Asia. LST-840 recommissioned on 3 November 1950 with Lieutenant Merle A. Coe in command. Following training off the West Coast and Hawaii, she loaded trucks and equipment, then departed Honolulu on 1 May 1951 for the Pacific staging areas. From June to November, the loading ship operated between Korea and Japan, shuttling cargo and prisoners of war along the war-torn peninsula. She returned to the United States on 27 November and, following overhaul, she departed Oakland, California on 16 May 1952 for duty in Alaska. LST-840 performed cargo operations there for six months before returning to San Diego. On 13 March 1953 she sailed on her second Korean tour, arriving at Yokosuka on 1 May. For the duration of the conflict, she remained in the Inchon vicinity and after the July truce continued peacekeeping operations in the Far East until late November. Post-war activities, 1954-1958 After a stay in the United States, LST-840 was back in the Far East, arriving at Henrietta Pass, French Indochina on 28 October 1954. In the aftermath of the Indochina War, she loaded French troops and equipment and shuttled them along the coast of southeast Asia. Arriving Subic Bay on 22 November, she operated in the Far East until April, 1955 then steamed for San Diego. LST-840 was named USS Iron County (LST-840) on 1 July 1955, and on 10 January 1956 she was en route to Pearl Harbor, her new home port. From January 1956 to November 1957 she performed amphibious exercises out of Hawaii, returning to the West Coast on 23 November. Decommissioning and transfer The ex-USS Iron County (LST-840) in Republic of China Naval service as ROC Chung Fu (LST-223), at the Republic of China Naval Base Tzoying in 1997. Iron County remained at San Francisco until 1 July 1958, when she decommissioned, struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred to the Republic of China under the Military Assistance Program, where she served the Chinese Nationalist Navy as ROCS Chung Fu (LST-223). Struck from the Republic of China Navy on 8 November 1997, her final fate is unknown. Awards LST-840 earned three battle stars for Korean War service.

It is endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The Matinan blue flycatcher is an unobtrusive small bird with an adult length of about . The head and upperparts are greyish-brown, greyer on the crown of the head, darker on the side of the head and on the wings, and more olivaceous on the rump and tail. The underparts are pale brownish-grey and the area round the vent is yellowish buff. The large eye is black and the bill, which has a broad base and fine tip, is pinkish-buff and surrounded by short bristles. Behaviour The Matinan blue flycatcher often joins other flycatchers in small flocks in the lower part of the forest canopy, and its behaviour and distribution is similar to that of the blue-fronted blue flycatcher (Cyornis hoevelli). It feeds on small insects which it catches by swooping from a perch where it has been keenly surveying its surroundings while twisting its head from side to side. It has been observed nesting in a cavity in a dead tree in a disturbed habitat which may indicate that it is capable of tolerating some destruction of the primary forest. Status The Matinan blue flycatcher is known from about four locations in the mountains of the Minahasa Peninsula in northern Sulawesi. One of these is the Gunung Ambang Nature Reserve where it is present in both primary and secondary forest at heights of around above sea level. The total number of these birds has not been quantified but may be in the region of between ten and twenty thousand individuals. The population is thought to be decreasing, the main reason for this being the degradation of its habitat, with the fringes of the montane forest being cleared by logging. Because of its small range and small population size, the IUCN lists this bird as being an \\"endangered species\\".

Design and development The Br√©guet Type III, which first flew in April 1910, was a development of the Type II which Br√©guet had built and flown earlier that year. Eliminating the upper booms that had helped to carry the tail surfaces of the earlier aircraft, it had what is now seen as the conventional biplane configuration, with a fuselage containing a front- mounted engine driving a tractor propeller and control and stabilising surfaces mounted at the rear. At the time this was an unusual layout: the Goupy II which had first flown the previous year was the first aircraft of this configuration to be successful. Like Br√©guet's earlier aircraft, extensive use of metal was made in its construction: the structure of the rectangular-section fuselage, wing spars and interplane struts were steel, and the ribs were aluminium pressings. The lower wings were mounted on a short spar mounted below the lower longerons and the upper wing was supported by only four struts, two inboard supporting the centre section of the wing, and one on either side connecting the mainspars of the wings near the wingtips. The mainspars of the wing panels were connected to the centre-section spar by knuckle joints, so that the wings could easily be folded back for road or rail transport. Four small vertical stabilisers were mounted below the upper wing, and a pair of supplementary control surfaces were mounted below the fuselage. These were intended for lateral control, and were operated in conjunction with wing-warping The rear-mounted empennage initially consisted of a fixed fin and rudder and a rectangular elevator, with no fixed horizontal surface, but this was soon replaced by a cruciform assembly combining rudder and elevator, connected to the fuselage by a universal joint. This unusual arrangement became a characteristic of the aircraft manufactured by Br√©guet before World War I. The prototype was powered by a Gnome Omega driving a three-bladed aluminium propeller through a 2:1 reduction gear. Later aircraft were produced with other powerplants. Operational history A Type III gained fame in August 1910 by being the first aircraft to lift six people.

Surveys have found the bird prefers to live in small, localised populations. An isolated colony was found in the Conondale Range in southeastern Queensland in the 1980s. Eastern bristlebirds build their nests on the ground in areas of dense, clumped grasses.

Although their exact position within the Australasian basal lineages of passerines is not fully resolved, Marki et al.‚Äôs 2017 study, the first to sample and sequence molecular data for all three species of bristlebirds, placed them within the ecologically diverse infra-order Meliphagides (formerly known as Meliphagoidea). This lineage consists of five families: Maluridae (fairywrens and allies), Acanthizidae (thornbills and gerygones), Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), Pardalotidae (pardalotes) and Dasyornithidae (bristlebirds). While other families within this grouping are highly speciose e.g. the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) - 187 species, Dasyornis broadbenti, D. brachypterus' and D. longirostris are only three known species of bristlebirds. Marki et al. found strong support for D. broadbenti' as sister lineage to D. brachypterus and D. longirostris, having diverged from its relatives in the mid-Miocene ca.13 Mya and that D. brachypterus and D. longirostris diverged in the early Pliocene, ca. 5 Mya. They infer from this that genetic divergences within the family may be greater than their similar morphologies might suggest and urge denser sampling to explore the possibility of overlooked cryptic species. Description Bristlebirds are long-tailed, sedentary, ground-frequenting birds. They vary in length from about 17 cm to 27 cm, with the Eastern Bristlebird the smallest, and the Rufous Bristlebird the largest, species. Their colouring is mainly grey with various shades of brown, ranging from olive-brown through chestnut and rufous, on the plumage of the upperparts. The grey plumage of the underparts or the mantle is marked by pale dappling or scalloping.Pizzey, Graham; & Knight, Frank. (2003). The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. HarperCollins. 7th edn. The common name of the family is derived from the presence of prominent rictal bristles \\\\- three stiff, hair-like feathers curving downwards on either side of the gape. This feature distinguishes them from the scrub-birds, to which they are similar in appearance although not closely related. The bristles, which are conspicuous in many birds that like the bristlebirds forage for insects in dark locations, may serve a tactile function in locating or manipulating prey. Distribution and habitat Eastern Bristlebirds were first seen by Europeans in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) when Latham first described the species for science in 1801. According to Gould, they were \\"to be found throughout New South Wales in all places suitable to its habits, although, from the recluse nature of its disposition, it is a species familiar to few, even of those who have long been resident in the colony.\\" After two centuries of European colonisation, two of the three species of bristlebirds are endangered (see Status and Conservation), and all have restricted and disjunct ranges. Their distributions are non-overlapping, with the Western Bristlebird, inhabiting a tiny area of dense heathland on the south-west coast of Western Australia, the most specialised. On the east coast, the Eastern Bristlebird occupies a wider range of habitats in relict pockets of far south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, and coastal fringes south of Sydney to the Victorian border. The Rufous Bristlebird's range is dense coastal shrub and heathland in far south-west Victoria and extreme east South Australia. The least-shy member of the family, the newly discovered subspecies caryochrous, occurs in open eucalyptus forest with dense understorey in the Otway range, but is also found in car parks, tracks and gardens along the edges of its dense habitat. Gould's description of the Eastern Bristlebird's habitat as \\"reed-beds and thickets, particularly such as are overgrown with creepers and vegetation\\" captures the density of coastal heath scrub and grasslands favoured by the Dasyornithidae, although not the fire-dependence of these environments, which require burning to prevent the trees shading out the grass component. Behaviour and ecology Western, eastern and rufous bristlebirds Often described as shy, elusive or secretive, they scamper through the thickest vegetation on strong legs, sometimes with their tails held partly erect. They preferentially run to avoid danger, but are capable of flying short distances on their short rounded wings. They are more often heard than seen, singing in sweet and resonant voices with a distinctive metallic character. It is usually the male that sings. The song is thought to be territorial in nature and is often made from on top of a log or shrub to better carry in the air. Diurnal, nothing is known of their roosting behaviour except that it is in dense thickets. They generally occur in pairs, but their social structure has not been studied closely. Most of the food is found by foraging on the ground. Birds forage in pairs, making small contact calls to keep in touch, and constantly flicking their tails whilst moving. The major part of the diet is composed of insects and seeds. Spiders and worms are also taken, and birds have been observed drinking nectar as well. The breeding behaviour of bristlebirds is poorly known. They are thought to mostly be monogamous and defend a territory against others of the same species. The Western Bristlebird breeds July‚ÄìOctober, the two eastern species between August and February. All are single-brooded, and eastern and Rufous Bristlebirds will lay replacement clutches if the first one is lost, an important factor in the success of captive breeding programs being undertaken in Queensland for the critically endangered northern subspecies monoides of the Eastern bristlebird. The nest is constructed by the female in low vegetation and is a large ovoid dome with a side entrance with finer grasses for lining. Two eggs are laid, white or dullish whitish-brown or pink dotted with purplish-brown spots. As far as is known only the female incubates the clutch, for a period of between sixteen and twenty-one days. Both sexes feed the young. The nestling stage is known to be long, eighteen to twenty-one days. Status and conservation With two of the three recognised species already on the IUCN Red List, the Dasyornithidae are increasingly vulnerable to habitat destruction by ever more fierce and frequent bush fires. The Rufous Bristlebird D. broadbenti is still comparatively common in its core areas of western Victoria and far south-east South Australia, but the ranges of the other two species have contracted since European settlement to relict populations found almost entirely within national parks and reserves with appropriate weed eradication and fire management regimes. The latter are essential for bristlebirds: with their small rounded wings they are poor flyers and prefer to run than to fly. Large and unchecked bushfires can cause local extinctions, compounding population fragmentation. Recent research suggests total avoidance of fire in the management of Western and Rufous Bristlebird populations. Eastern bristlebirds require a more delicate balance with some degree of burning needed to promote regeneration of the grasslands they favour but too much destroying both habitat and potential refugia where populations can shelter until vegetation recovers. Habitat loss since European settlement from land-clearing for agriculture and extensive housing development along coastal strips in more recent times also threatens bristlebird survival. The western subspecies litoralis of the Rufous Bristlebird, once found in dense impenetrable shrub-land on the coastal dunes of extreme south-west Western Australia is probably extinct.Morcombe, Michael.

Starting with the first season, which included two shows, and continuing to the present with four shows performed annually, the Carnegie Players encourage participation both on the stage and off by anyone in the Johnson County area. The theatre has produced many talented actors and actresses in its time, and is still continuing to remain a great theatre force in Cleburne, Texas. History In 1978, the City of Cleburne moved their storage-house from the top floor theatre of the Carnegie Library building, which had been built by a grant to the city from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation in 1904. This move opened the door for renovation of the theatre and the founding of a theatre troupe for the city. Thus, The Greater Cleburne Carnegie Players was founded. The renovation project involved many local citizens along with the city and took two years to completion. Since 1980, all Fall, Winter, and Spring productions have been performed on The Layland Museum Theatre stage (located at 201 N. Caddo), whereas the summer musicals have been performed at Cleburne High School. Beginning in the summer of 2010, the Carnegie Players moved into the Community Performing Arts Center located in the newly remodeled Cleburne Conference Center. The Carnegie Players' last production in the old Carnegie Theater was the musical 1776 in March 2010, while the first show in the new theatre was The Wizard of Oz in June 2010.

MovieTickets.com provides movie times for all theaters, and online ticket purchasing for all Clearview Cinemas and National Amusements theaters, among other smaller chains; such as Mann Theatres in Los Angeles. In 2010, MovieTickets.com sold over 16 million tickets for over 200 exhibitors, with 14,000 screens. In 2001, Moviefone.com and Movietickets.com entered in a partnership in 2001 that crosslinked their ticketing offerings. In 2004, MovieTickets.com became the exclusive online ticket vendor for Moviefone.com. Then, in mid-2005, MovieTickets.com established a ticket distribution relationship with the consignment ticket reseller PrintTixUSA, adding 20 movie exhibition companies to its ranks and boosting the total number of screens serviced nationwide to more than 10,000. Since then, however, MovieTickets.com had lost ground, losing sole rights to the AMC chain and Moviefone's telephone arm to rival Fandango. In April 2016, Movietickets.com reported it had provided advance ticketing services to 250 theater chains, representing over 50 percent of the top 100 grossing theaters in North America on any given weekend. In October 2017, Fandango Media purchased MovieTickets.com. This purchase united the industry's two biggest online movie-ticketing services (Fandango's ticketing network spanned more than 33,000 screens worldwide; MovieTickets.com's over 29,000, with significant overlap between the two, e.g., both companies sold tickets to both AMC and Regal Cinemas) and increased Fandango's global screen count by approximately 20%, to over 40,000 screens worldwide. Competition with Fandango Acquisitions and mergers of movie chains have complicated matters regarding which ticketing companies provide online ticketing for a particular theatre chain. MovieTickets.com lost the Hoyts theater chain when the latter was acquired by the Regal Entertainment Group theater chain, a founder of Movietickets.com's rival online ticketing agency Fandango; however, when Regal acquired Consolidated Theatres, the latter retained its contractual relationship with MovieTickets.com. Prior to 2012, MovieTickets.com provided online ticketing for AMC Theatres except those cinemas originally part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain, whose online ticketing is provided by Fandango due to contractual obligations in place prior to the 2005 merger of the two movie chains. In 2002, Loews had attempted to break the contract under pressure of bankruptcy and from (then) AOL Moviefone and its partner, Loews' Cineplex subsidiary; Fandango successfully sued both Loews and Moviefone, and retained the Loews business. Furthermore, as of February 8, 2012, Fandango began providing ticketing for non-Loews AMC Theatres in the US as well, after which MovieTickets.com's fellow shareholders sued AMC for breach of contract. AMC and MovieTickets.com settled in 2013, with an agreement that the theater chain's online ticketing would be available on both Fandango and MovieTickets.com. In May 2012, MovieTickets.com's former partner Moviefone announced a new partnership with Fandango, when its relationship with MovieTickets.com lapsed.

Its services are available to around 13,000 school children. In July the music service was given an Outstanding level through MSEP evaluation. The service supports fifteen Saturday morning music centres and many music and drama groups, all within Northamptonshire. Membership of the county level groups is determined by an annual audition process in July. For most groups there are three levels: Junior, Training and Youth which are usually abbreviated by staff and students, e.g. County Junior Wind Orchestra (CJWO), County Training Strings (CTS) and County Youth Orchestra (CYO). There are groups covering ensemble, orchestral, brass band, wind band, jazz, rock, guitar, percussion, voice, drama, dance and early years music. In April 2012 the service became an independent, charitable trust and in May 2012 it was designated as the government's music and education hub for the area.  Location  The music service headquarters is in Northampton in a Victorian school building on the corner of Clare Street and the Kettering Road that used to be known as John Clare School.  Performances and events  Groups from the music service perform at the Derngate, Spinney Hill Theatre, Cripps Hall, the Lighthouse Theatre and other venues throughout the year. Each year, there are residential courses at Grendon Hall for students in Junior and Training Groups. Students in CYO, the County Youth Concert Band (CYCB) and the County Youth Brass Band (CYBB) go on tours to a foreign country in alternate years. From 2016, the County Youth Choir (CYCh) have also toured. The CYO and CYCh tour jointly one year, and the CYBB and CYCB the following year. For example in July 2014, the CYO went to Germany, and in July 2015, the CYCB and CYBB went to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, including a performance at Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Castle.

He made the vast majority of his appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers. A former Chelsea youth team player, he moved from Mile Oak Rovers into the English Football League with Notts County in 1984. Three years later he joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. He spent six years with Wolves, winning the Football League Trophy in 1988 and successive Fourth Division and Third Division titles in 1987‚Äì88 and 1988‚Äì89. He joined Birmingham City in 1993, before moving on to Stoke City the following year. In 1995, he joined Hereford United via Cardiff City, and retired in 1999. Downing went on to become a coach, and also spent September 2007 to November 2008 as Cheltenham Town manager, and served West Bromwich Albion as caretaker-manager for a brief spell in the 2013‚Äì14 Premier League season. He was appointed England U20 head coach in July 2015, and then took up the same role at the England U19's 13 months later, whom he led to the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship title. Playing career Early career Downing was a junior player at Chelsea, but left Stamford Bridge at the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season. He went on to spend a season with Mile Oak Rovers. He began his professional career in 1984 at Richie Barker's Notts County, who went on to be relegated out of the Second Division at the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season. The \\"Magpies\\" finished eighth in the Third Division in the 1985‚Äì86 season and then seventh in 1986‚Äì87 under the stewardship of Jimmy Sirrel. Wolverhampton Wanderers He left Meadow Lane and moved on to Graham Turner's Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1987. Wolves won promotion as champions of the Fourth Division in 1987‚Äì88, and Downing also played in the 1988 Football League Trophy final victory over Burnley at Wembley Stadium. Wolves won a second successive promotion in the 1988‚Äì89 season, winning the Third Division title by an eight-point margin. The club made a push for promotion out of the Second Division in 1989‚Äì90, but ended up in tenth place, seven points outside of the play-off places. Downing appeared 35 times in both the 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92 seasons, as Wolves finished in 12th and then 11th position. He played 37 times in the 1992‚Äì93 campaign before leaving Molineux in the summer. Later career In July 1993 Downing moved to Birmingham City. However, he featured only twice for Blues in the 1993‚Äì94 season, and left St Andrew's in the summer. He remained in the Midlands and the First Division for the 1994‚Äì95 season, playing 24 games for Stoke City. He began the 1995‚Äì96 season with Cardiff City, before being reunited with Graham Turner at Hereford United in September 1995. The \\"Bulls\\" finished sixth in the Third Division in the 1995‚Äì96 campaign, losing to Darlington in the play-offs. He made 13 appearances in the 1996‚Äì97 campaign as Hereford dropped out of the Football League with a last place finish. He became player-coach in 1998 and subsequently returned to Wolves as a youth team coach in March 1999. Management career Cheltenham Town Downing joined Cheltenham Town as assistant manager in July 2004, working alongside manager John Ward, who he had met through his time at Wolverhampton Wanderers where Ward had been assistant manager. When Ward left the club to join Carlisle United in October 2007, Downing stepped in as caretaker manager, before being given the position on a full-time basis on 2 November. He endured a difficult start to his management career, but was aided by three loan signings from Bristol City in the January transfer window ‚Äì Steve Brooker, Alex Russell and Richard Keogh, as well as free agent defender Alan Wright. Cheltenham avoided relegation on the last day of the 2007‚Äì08 season with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Doncaster Rovers at Whaddon Road. However they struggled after striker Steven Gillespie was sold to Colchester United for ¬£400,000. Downing left the club by mutual consent on 13 September 2008 with the \\"Robins\\" bottom of League One. Coaching spell In February 2009, he was appointed assistant manager at League Two side Port Vale. This was a temporary appointment to help manager Dean Glover, and both men left the club in May 2009. In July 2009, Downing was appointed the academy coach at West Bromwich Albion. He served as joint-assistant head coach for the \\"Baggies\\" under Steve Clarke and in December 2013 temporarily took over first team duties at the Premier League club after Clarke was sacked and before Pepe Mel was appointed as manager early the following month. He was not a popular figure with fans at The Hawthorns due to his years of service at Black Country derby rivals Wolves. However his UEFA Pro Licence and popularity with the players made him a serious candidate to replace Mel in the summer. Alan Irvine got the job however, and Downing left the club in January 2015 following a backroom reshuffle by new boss Tony Pulis. England youth Downing was appointed head coach of the England U20 team in July 2015, initially on an interim basis. His appointed was made permanent in February 2016. He changed roles to become head coach of the England U19 team in August 2016. He led the under-19s to victory in the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Portugal. He was a part of Gareth Southgate's scouting team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Downing left his post in August 2020 to join Championship club Bristol City as an assistant head coach to Dean Holden. Personal life Downing married in 1993, and has two sons from that marriage. He is a cousin of Judas Priest guitarist K. K. Downing. He has an interest in criminology and history, specifically the history of World War II.

Designed by Edward S. Shaw, the bridge abutments and piers were built by the firm of Ellis & Buswell of Woburn, Massachusetts, and the superstructure was built by the New England Structural Company of East Everett, Massachusetts.HAER, p. 8 The bridge was commissioned by Francis R. Schell, who gave $42,000 for design and construction.HAER, p. 4 Construction began in 1901 and was completed in 1903. In 1985, due to advanced deterioration of the steel truss members, the bridge was barricaded and abandoned.  History  The Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad had established rail service to Northfield by 1850, along a line running from Millers Falls, Massachusetts, to Brattleboro, Vermont. Even though the railway crossed the Connecticut River in Northfield, East Northfield Station was actually located in West Northfield, making it necessary for disembarking passengers to travel back across the Connecticut River on the lower deck of the rail bridge. To provide for safer and more convenient access across the river, Francis Schell gave $42,000 for the construction of a new steel bridge.HAER, pp. 6-7 After initially being scheduled for demolition by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation in 2007 or 2008, efforts by local preservationists to save the historical landmark delayed the proposed demolition. In 2013, a group called \\"Friends of the Schell Bridge\\", which had been dedicated to saving the bridge, reversed course and sided with the state in favor of demolishing the historic bridge. Preservation effort A year- long engineering study was performed by the Picker Engineering School at Smith College, which determined that the bridge is structurally sound and is a good candidate for rehabilitation. There has been no accessible bridge crossing between East Northfield and West Northfield since the closing of the bridge in 1985, besides the large Route 10 bridge a mile to the South. Northfield is the only town in Franklin County to be divided by the Connecticut River. It had been proposed that, if preserved, the bridge will be reopened only to travel by foot, bicycle, snowmobile, and emergency vehicle. It would be integrated into the tri-state rails-to-trails initiative connecting a series of recreational trails in northern Massachusetts, southwestern New Hampshire, and southeastern Vermont. MassDOT has decided to replace the bridge. Refurbishing it would cost roughly $39M, whereas replacement would cost more like $16.3M. The form of the replacement is under consideration. The replacement will be a steel tied-arch bridge. Image gallery Image:IMG 4007 serious blockage.jpgThis 2007 photograph shows a steel plate across the east portal of the Schell bridge. A similar one is on the west portal, since the bridge deck is rusting through. The top of the plate reads \\"Where the sidewalk ends.\\" The plate has a \\"NO TRESPASSING\\" sign bolted to it as well. Image:Metal Barrier.JPGView of the metal barriers while on Schell bridge.

The closed testing principle Suppose there are k hypotheses H1,..., Hk to be tested and the overall type I error rate is Œ±. The closed testing principle allows the rejection of any one of these elementary hypotheses, say Hi, if all possible intersection hypotheses involving Hi can be rejected by using valid local level Œ± tests. It controls the familywise error rate for all the k hypotheses at level Œ± in the strong sense. Example Suppose there are three hypotheses H1,H2, and H3 to be tested and the overall type I error rate is 0.05.

From a panel in the crypt of Freising Cathedral. In Christianity, the translation of relics is the removal of holy objects from one locality to another (usually a higher- status location); usually only the movement of the remains of the saint's body would be treated so formally, with secondary relics such as items of clothing treated with less ceremony. Translations could be accompanied by many acts, including all-night vigils and processions, often involving entire communities. The solemn translation (in Latin, translatio) of relics is not treated as the outward recognition of sanctity. Rather, miracles confirmed a saint's sanctity, as evinced by the fact that when, in the twelfth century, the Papacy attempted to make sanctification an official process; many collections of miracles were written in the hope of providing proof of the saint-in-question's status. In the early Middle Ages, however, solemn translation marked the moment at which, the saint's miracles having been recognized, the relic was moved by a bishop or abbot to a prominent position within the church. Local veneration was then permitted. This process is known as local canonization.Eric Waldram Kemp, Canonization and Authority in the Western Church, Oxford, 1948. The date of a translation of a saint's relics was celebrated as a feast day in its own right. For example, on January 27 is celebrated the translation of the relics of St. John Chrysostom from the Armenian village of Comana (where he died in exile in 407) to Constantinople.The Translation of the Relics of St. John Chrysostom The most commonly celebrated feast days, however, are the (the day on which the saint died, not the modern idea of birthday). Relics sometimes travelled very far. The relics of Saint Thyrsus at Sozopolis, Pisidia, in Asia Minor, were brought to Constantinople and then to Spain. His cult became popular in the Iberian Peninsula, where he is known as San Tirso or Santo Tirso.Christian Iconography Some of his relics were brought to France: Thyrsus is thus the titular saint of the cathedral of Sisteron in the Basses Alpes,http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0128.shtml#thyr the Cath√©drale Notre Dame et Saint Thyrse. Thyrsus is thus the patron saint of Sisteron.http://www.sisteron-tourisme.fr/visiterlacathedraledesisteron.html Liborius of Le Mans became patron saint of Paderborn, in Germany, after his relics were transferred there in 836.Saints of July 23 History Translation of the relics of St. Gregory to the monastery of Petershausen. In the early church, the disturbance, let alone the division, of the remains of martyrs and other saints, was not of concern or interest, much less practised. It was assumed that they would remain permanently in their often-unidentified resting places in cemeteries and the catacombs of Rome (but always outside the walls of the city, continuing a pagan taboo). Then, martyriums began to be built over the site of the burial of saints. It came to be considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to saintly remains, and as such, several large \\"funerary halls\\" were built over the sites of martyr's graves, the primary example being the Old Saint Peter's Basilica. The earliest recorded removal of saintly remains was that of Saint Babylas at Antioch in 354. However, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, translations soon became common in the Eastern Empire, even though it was still prohibited in the West. The Eastern capital was able to acquire the remains of Saints Timothy, Andrew and Luke. The division of bodies also began; the 5th-century theologian Theodoretus declaring that \\"Grace remains entire with every part\\". An altar slab dated 357, found in North Africa but now in the Louvre, records the deposit beneath it of relics from several prominent saints. Non-anatomical relics, above all that of the True Cross, were divided and widely distributed from the 4th century. In the West a decree of Theodosius I only allowed the moving of a whole sarcophagus with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 73; Burns & Oates, London, 1962;Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on the Louvre slab and True Cross. In the 4th century, Basil the Great requested of the ruler of Scythia Minor, Junius Soranus (Saran), that he should send him the relics of saints of that region. Saran sent the relics of Sabbas the Goth to him in Caesarea, Cappadocia, in 373 or 374 accompanied by a letter, the 'Epistle of the Church of God in Gothia to the Church of God located in Cappadocia and to all the Local Churches of the Holy Universal Church'. The sending of Sabbas' relics and the writing of the actual letter has been attributed to Bretannio. This letter is the oldest known writing to be composed on Romanian soil and was written in Greek. The spread of relics all over Europe from the 8th century onward is explained by the fact that after 787, all new Christian churches had to possess a relic before they could be properly consecrated.https://dhctranslations.com/history-of- translation/history-translation/ New churches, situated in areas newly converted to Christianity, needed relics and this encouraged the translation of relics to far-off places. Relics became collectible items, and owning them became a symbol of prestige for cities, kingdoms, and monarchs, Relics were also desirable as they generated income from pilgrims traveling to venerate them. According to one legend concerning Saint Paternian, the inhabitants of Fano competed with those of Cervia for possession of his relics. Cervia would be left with a finger, while Fano would possess the rest of the saint's relics.Riti e Credenze: San Paterniano 13 novembre - Cervia Turismo The translation of relics was a solemn and important event. In 1261, the relics of Lucian of Beauvais and his two companions were placed in a new reliquary by William of Gr√®s (Guillaume de Gr√®s), the bishop of Beauvais. The translation took place in the presence of St. Louis IX, the king of France, and Theobald II, the king of Navarre, as well as much of the French nobility. The memory of this translation was formerly celebrated in the abbey of Beauvais as the f√™te des Corps Saints.St Lucien - 1er Ev√™que du Beauvaisis On February 14, 1277, while work was being done at the church of St. John the Baptist (Johanniterkirche) in Cologne, the body of Saint Cordula, one of the companions of Saint Ursula, was discovered.Joachim Sighart, Albert the Great (R. Washbourne, 1876), 360. Her relics were found to be fragrant and on the forehead of the saint herself were written the words, ‚ÄúCordula, Queen and Virgin.‚Äù When Albert the Great, who had been residing in Cologne in his old age, had listened to the account of the finding of the relics, > ... he wept, praised God from the depth of his soul, and requested the > bystanders to sing the Te Deum. Then vesting himself in his episcopal robes, > he removed the relics from under the earth, and solemnly translated them > into the church of the monks of St. John. After singing Mass, he deposited > the holy body in a suitable place, which God has since made illustrious by > many miracles.Joachim Sighart, Albert the Great (R. Washbourne, 1876), > 361-362. Venerable Macarius (in the golden reliquary held by Archbishop Georgy of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas) visits the city of Kstovo during its translation from Nizhny Novgorod's Pechersky Ascension Monastery to Makaryev Monastery Some relics were translated from place to place, buffeted by the tides of wars and conflicts. The relics of Saint Leocadia were moved from Toledo to Oviedo during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman II, and from Oviedo they were brought to Saint-Ghislain (in present-day Belgium). Her relics were venerated there by Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile, who recovered for Toledo a tibia of the saint. Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba attempted unsuccessfully to rescue the rest of her relics.La di√≥cesis de Toledo celebra el A√±o Jubilar de santa Leocadia Finally, a Spanish Jesuit, after many travels, brought the rest of the saint‚Äôs relics to Rome in 1586. From Rome they were brought to Valencia by sea, and then finally brought to Toledo from Cuenca. Philip II of Spain presided over a solemn ceremony commemorating the final translation of her relics to Toledo, in April 1587. Idesbald‚Äôs relics were moved from their resting-place at the abbey of Ten Duinen after the Geuzen (‚ÄúSea Beggars‚Äù) plundered the abbey in 1577; his relics were translated again to Bruges in 1796 to avoid having them destroyed by Revolutionary troops.Beato Idesbaldo delle Dune The translation of the relics continued into modern times. On December 4, 1796, as a result of the French Revolution, the relics of Saint Lutgardis were carried to Ittre from Awirs. Her relics remain in Ittre.Santa Lutgarda Notable translations 17th-century icon of the Translation of the Relics of St. Nicholas of Myra, from Myra in Asia Minor to Bari, Italy in 1087 (Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland). Among the most famous translations is that of St Benedict of Nursia, author of the \\"Regula S. Benedicti\\", from Cassino to Fleury, which Adrevald memorialized. In England, the lengthy travels of St Cuthbert's remains to escape the Vikings, and then his less respectful treatment after the English Reformation, have been much studied, as his coffin, gospel book and other items buried with him are now very rare representatives of Anglo-Saxon art. Some well-known translations of relics include the removal of the body of Saint Nicholas from Myra in Asia Minor to Bari, Italy in 1087. Tradesmen of Bari visited the relics of Saint Nicholas in 1087 after finding out their resting-place from the monks who guarded them. According to one account, the monks showed the resting-place but then became immediately suspicious: \\"Why you men, do you make such a request? You haven't planned to carry off the remains of the holy saint from here? You don't intend to remove it to your own region? If that is your purpose, then let it be clearly known to you that you parley with unyielding men, even if it mean our death.\\"Medieval Sourcebook: The Translation of Saint Nicholas The tradesmen tried different tactics, including force, and manage to take hold of the relics. An anonymous chronicler writes about what happened when the inhabitants of Myra found out: Professor Nevzat Cevik, the Director of Archaeological Excavations in Demre (Myra), has recently recommended that the Turkish government should request the repatriation of St Nicholas' relics, alleging that it had always been the saint's intention to be buried in Myra.See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8432314.stm The Venetians, who also claimed to have some parts of St Nicholas, had another story: The Venetians brought the remains back to Venice, but on the way they left an arm of St Nicholas at Bari (The Morosini Codex 49A). Jacopo Tintoretto's depiction of the secret translation of the relics of Saint Mark. In 828, Venetian merchants acquired the supposed relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist from Alexandria, Egypt. These are housed in St Mark's Basilica; in 1968, a small fragment of bone was donated to the Coptic Church in Alexandria. In recent times A famous and recent example is the return of the relics of John Chrysostom and Gregory of Nazianzus to the See of Constantinople (Greek Orthodox Church) by Pope John Paul II in November 2004.Report by the Ecumenical Patriarchate at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Eztvp0CN4Q See the ecumenical celebration at the Office for Christian Unity at http://www.christianunity.va/content/unitacristiani/en/dialoghi/sezione- orientale/chiese-ortodosse-di-tradizione-bizantina/relazioni- bilaterali/patriarcato-ecumenico/altri-documenti-ed-eventi/2004-celebrazione- ecumenica-reliquie-ss-gregorio-nazianzo-e-giov.html Another modern example is the exhumation, display, and reburial of the relics of Padre Pio in 2008-2009.

Early life and education Huxman was born in Pretty Prairie, Kansas, and grew up on the family farm attending the local schools. He became a school teacher and from 1907 to 1909 he was principal of the Castleton Grade school and in 1910, principal of the Pretty Prairie Grade School. He attended Kansas State Normal School (now Emporia State University Teachers College) for two years and the University of Kansas School of Law where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1914. On January 21, 1915, he married Eula E. Biggs and they had one daughter, Ruth. Career When he was admitted to the Kansas State Bar, Huxman formed a partnership with Charles S. Fulton in Hutchinson, Kansas. As well as being in private practice from 1919 to 1937, he was an Assistant County Attorney of Kansas from 1915 to 1919, a city attorney from 1919 to 1921, and a Member of the Kansas State Tax Commission from 1931 to 1932. An accomplished keynote speaker and Chairman at the 1936 Democratic State Convention, Huxman was drafted as gubernatorial candidate. He won the election and was sworn in as the Governor of Kansas on January 11, 1937. Huxman's election as governor marked a reflection on his Republican predecessor, Alf Landon, who did not seek reelection as governor as he was instead the 1936 Republican presidential nominee. Landon had failed to carry Kansas in the presidential race which would indicate that Huxman would have defeated Landon had Landon ran for re-election as governor. During Huxman's tenure as Governor, World War I Soldier bonuses were paid, unemployment compensations benefits were approved, and driver's license regulations were amended. Huxman ran for re-election in 1938 but was defeated by Republican Payne Ratner. Federal judicial service Huxman was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 24, 1939, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge Robert L. Williams. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 17, 1939, and received his commission on May 23, 1939. He assumed senior status on April 1, 1957. His service terminated on June 25, 1972, due to his death. He was interred at Penwell-Gabel Cemetery and Mausoleum in Topeka, Shawnee County, Kansas.

Early years While pitching at Ohio University, the nineteen year old was originally drafted by the Houston Astros in the 18th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. A year later, the San Francisco Giants drafted Murphy in the fourth round of the secondary phase of the draft, but he again did not sign. Finally, when the California Angels selected him sixth overall in the January draft, he signed. Murphy hit the ground running in his first assignment in professional baseball with the Midwest League Quad Cities Angels. In six games, he went 5-1 with a 2.34 earned run average to earn a quick promotion to double A. In eight games with the El Paso Sun Kings, Murphy maintained a 2.76 ERA to earn a second promotion to the triple A Pacific Coast League's Seattle Angels, where he would finish out the season. California Angels Following brief stints in El Paso and Seattle, Murphy was called up to the majors early in the season. After striking out seven in a no decision in his major league debut, Murphy earned a complete game victory over the New York Yankees in his second start. Murphy's own error in the third inning accounted for the Yankees' one unearned run. He was a hard luck loser on July 28 against the Chicago White Sox. After a rough first inning in which he gave up two runs, Murphy settled in to pitch seven innings of one hit ball. The Angels, however, were only able to plate one run off Jack Fisher. For the season, Murphy went 5-6 with a 2.17 ERA in fifteen starts. Murphy was cursed with wildness in . He led the American League with sixteen wild pitches and 21 hit batsmen on his way to a 10-16 record and 4.21 ERA. He rebounded with a career year in . On May 7, he pitched his first career shutout over the Washington Senators. He went 16-13 for the season, the only season of his career in which he had a winning record. It was also his best season with the bat. He had a career bests .184 batting average and seven runs batted in. He also hit his only career home run off the Milwaukee Brewers' Lew Krausse Jr.. The wheels came off for Murphy in . After winning his first start of the season, he dropped his next five decisions. He would also lose his final six decisions despite a relatively mild 3.31 ERA over that span. In Murphy's 36 starts, the Angels were shut out eight times, and scored just one run nine times, resulting in a 6-17 record. Kansas City Royals In , Murphy appeared in six games for the Angels, all in relief, when he was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Bob Oliver. He made three appearances out of the bullpen before he was moved into the starting rotation. He made his first start against his former franchise, and while he made a quality start (7 IP, 2 R), he came out on the losing end. He was 3-1 with a high 5.81 ERA when an injury kept him off the field for all of July and August. When he returned, he pitched his only shutout of the season before being shifted back to the bullpen for the remainder of the season. He earned his first career save against the Angels on September 19. St. Louis Cardinals Murphy began the season in triple A. After three games with the Omaha Royals, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Al Santorini. Murphy got off to a rough start with the Cardinals. On June 29, he was 0-3 despite a 2.37 ERA. A complete game loss to the Montreal Expos on August 2 followed by poor outings against the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds led to him being moved to the bullpen toward the end of the season. He went 3-7 with a 3.76 ERA his only season in St. Louis. During the off season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for second baseman Bob Heise. Milwaukee Brewers For the season, Brewers Manager Del Crandall and Pitching coach Al Widmar converted Murphy into a full-time reliever. He soon evolved into Crandall's favorite arm out of the bullpen. He pitched two innings of no hit ball when he earned his first save of the season on April 26, giving him a total of twelve innings pitched with just one earned run. From July 8 through August 8, Murphy pitched twenty innings in which he gave up only seven hits and did not give up a run. He suffered his tenth loss of the season in a seventeen inning marathon with the Baltimore Orioles when Brewers third baseman Don Money misplayed a ground ball (no error was charged on the play). He won in extra innings against the Yankees on the second to last day of the season to close out the season with an even 10-10 record. In what was unquestionably his best season as a reliever, he led the American League with 66 games closed, and was second in the AL with twenty saves. He led the Brewers with a 1.90 ERA, ten wins and 123 innings pitched in relief. He matched his twenty save total in , however, with a 1-9 record, and an inflated 4.90 ERA. He was hit hard, and took a loss at the hands of the Yankees in his first appearance of the season, but settled down somewhat from there (18 IP, 11 ER) when he and pitcher turned outfielder Bobby Darwin were traded to the Boston Red Sox for 1975 World Series hero Bernie Carbo at the June trade deadline. Boston Red Sox Shortly after Murphy joined the Bosox, Reggie Cleveland was converted back into a starter, and Murphy and Jim Willoughby shared the brunt of the relief duties. Murphy pitched poorly in his first two games with the Red Sox. In his first game against the Oakland Athletics, he entered in the ninth inning with no outs and a runner on second. He gave up a single to the first batter he faced (Sal Bando) and hit Gene Tenace with a pitch to load the bases. Exceptional defense from the Sox infield prevented any runs from scoring. He wasn't so lucky in his next appearance. Murphy entered in the eighth with a runner on second and two outs. Tenace hit what should have been an inning ending ground ball to third, however, a throwing error by third baseman Steve Dillard allowed the runner to score and kept the inning alive. After an intentional walk to Billy Williams, doubles by Phil Garner and Tim Hosley scored three unearned runs to give Oakland an 8-5 lead and make Murphy the pitcher of record on the losing end without giving up an earned run. A walk to Bill North knocked Murphy out of the game without recording an out. From there, he rebounded with wins in his next two decisions. He ended up going 4-5 with a 3.44 ERA his first season in Boston. His eight saves and 81 innings out of the bullpen were second only to Willoughby. Boston suffered an embarrassing 19-9 loss to the Cleveland Indians in the second game of the season. Murphy pitched 1.1 innings, and surrendered three runs. A week later, he suffered his first loss of the season to the Indians. A horrible month of May (10.61 ERA) got him relegated to \\"mop up duty\\" until he was placed on waivers midway through the season. On July 27, he was claimed by the expansion Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto Blue Jays Going from a pennant contender to a last place club seemed to do Murphy some good. He earned his first save of the season in his second game in a Jays uniform. Two weeks later, he got his first win of the season against the Royals. He made his first start in over four years on September 11, and held the Yankees to one run in six innings for his second win. All told, he went 2-1 with two saves and a 3.63 ERA for Toronto. Murphy began the season as the Jays' closer, earning six saves through the month of June. Once V√≠ctor Cruz joined the club in mid June, Murphy shifted into more of a long reliever role. He led Blue Jays relievers with 94 innings pitched and was second to Cruz with seven saves and six wins. He made ten appearances with the Jays in , going 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA, before he was released on May 12.

Raised in New Jersey, Lange first worked as a longshoreman and taxi driver to help support his family, following the death of his quadriplegic father. He debuted as a stand-up comic in 1987 and took up the profession full-time five years later, developing his act in the New York City area. In 1995, Lange moved to Los Angeles to star in the first season of Mad TV. His arrest for cocaine possession during the second season led to his departure and subsequent rehabilitation. In 1997, Norm Macdonald chose Lange to co-star in his comedy film Dirty Work (1998), which secured Lange further acting roles including Macdonald's sitcom The Norm Show. In 2001, Lange returned to New Jersey and joined The Howard Stern Show and pursued various projects during this time; he released two comedy albums, co- wrote, produced, and starred in his feature film Beer League (2006), and released his first book, Too Fat to Fish (2008), which entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number one. After attempting suicide in early 2010, Lange completed rehabilitation and resumed his career in the following year. He hosted The Nick & Artie Show with Nick Di Paolo until 2013, when Di Paolo left and Lange continued to host his own program, The Artie Lange Show, until 2014. During this time, Lange released his second book, Crash and Burn (2013). He hosted The Artie Quitter Podcast from 2015 to 2017 which was followed by a recurring role in the HBO series Crashing and a stint as co-host of The Artie and Anthony Show with Anthony Cumia until 2018. That year, he released his third book Wanna Bet? and paused his career following a series of arrests and drug rehabilitation. After becoming sober, Lange resumed stand-up and began his Artie Lange's Halfway House podcast in 2019. In February 2020, Lange again paused his career and his podcast, citing personal health issues.  Early life  Lange was born on October 11, 1967 in Livingston, New Jersey, and was raised in Union Township, Union County. His mother, Judy (n√©e Caprio), of Italian descent, was a housewife, while his father, Arthur Lange Sr., of German descent, was a general contractor who installed television antennas. His sister Stacey is a fashion designer. Two weeks after Lange's birth, his father went on trial for keeping $200,000 in counterfeit money for a loan shark, but was spared jail time out of the court's sympathy for his young son. In August 2003, Lange found out he is approximately twenty-five per cent American Indian after submitting a sample of his DNA for testing. Lange attended Union High School, during which he played baseball and became an all- county third baseman. His poor grades required him to attend summer school in order to graduate. In August 1985, Lange was arrested for attempted bank robbery. He claimed he was trying to flirt with the teller by passing her a note that said he was armed and demanded $50,000. The teller took it seriously, triggering a silent alarm. His charge was reduced to disorderly conduct which required Lange to pay $500 in court fees and complete 25 hours of community service in March 1986. As part of his probation, Lange attended the Connecticut School of Broadcasting from March to June 1987. In 1985, Lange gained admission to Seton Hall University in New Jersey using a connection his uncle had with an employee of the admissions department. In one early assignment, he received an A grade for a presentation he made, telling stories about his friends and family to the class. \\"It was the first time I got a bunch of laughs in front of a crowd of total strangers and it felt amazing to get that reaction from people.\\" After four weeks, Lange became bored \\"to death\\" and began to think of ways to quit. On October 18, his father fell off a ladder while installing an antenna and broke his back, becoming quadriplegic. Money soon became an issue in the family. Lange's mother took up a secretarial job and Lange spent a short time installing antennas himself. Lange recalled the situation: \\"We took out a second mortgage. Medicaid paid for a nurse eight hours a day. When my mother got back from being a secretary all day, she had to take care of him. Every night, she set her alarm clock to turn him so he wouldn't get bedsores.\\" In 1987, the family contacted celebrities asking them to donate items for auction. Howard Stern, the only one to respond, sent them an autographed jacket and said on the air, \\"Does this guy think that if he puts the jacket on he's going to walk again?\\", which Lange and his father found funny. Lange's father died from complications of an infection in 1990, though he believes one of his father's \\"crazy friends\\" may have helped him to commit suicide.  Career   1987‚Äì1995: Early career  Lange cites Richard Pryor, Richard Lewis, and George Carlin as early influences. On July 12, 1987, at age nineteen, Lange performed his first stand-up comedy routine at The Improv in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan. He recalled, \\"I bombed for five minutes. Everyone thinks that they can do better. I was unprepared, I mumbled, and I forgot stuff. But I'm proud that I did it.\\" Lange would not attempt stand-up again for another four years. In 1988, Lange took acting classes for three weeks from Sandy Dennis at HB Studio in New Jersey; he quit after he could no longer afford them. In February 1991, Lange supported his family by taking up work as a longshoreman at Port Newark, loading ships at its orange juice pier. In that year alone, Lange earned around $60,000. In September 1992, Lange quit his longshoreman job to focus on a comedy career, giving himself one year to make it at stand-up. During his search for work, his regular form of employment was driving a taxi in New York City. The flexibility of his taxi job allowed him to perform sets at the clubs and resume work afterwards. Lange's first paid gig as a stand-up followed at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York for a payment of $30. He then became a paid regular for the first time in 1992 at Stand Up NY in Manhattan, followed by Comic Strip Live, where he would perform a 20-minute set from Tuesday to Saturday nights. Within a year of starting, Lange landed a role in a dinner theater play, touring restaurants and catering halls across New Jersey. He then co-formed an improv troupe called Live on Tape which sold out Caroline's on Broadway numerous times. The success of these shows led to a contract with the William Morris Agency where Lange met Peter Principato, his manager for the next ten years. Lange took up extra work with roles in commercials which were a \\"big step up\\", including a voiceover for Foot Locker, which entitled him to become a member of AFTRA. During this time, Lange developed an addiction to cocaine and alcohol.  1995‚Äì1997: Mad TV and arrest At twenty-seven, Lange was chosen as one of the eight cast members selected to star in the sketch comedy series Mad TV, from the eight thousand that were screened. He flew to Los Angeles in May 1995 to shoot the television pilot which was picked up by the Fox network. Lange moved to Los Angeles two months later to film the first season with a salary of $7,500 per episode plus \\"a big signing bonus\\". Lange's cocaine abuse worsened during this time, doing it \\"like it was going out of style\\". In November 1995, after nine episodes had been shot, he attempted suicide after he ran out of cocaine, drank whiskey and \\"a bunch of pills\\", and wrote a suicide note to his mother and sister. He claimed, \\"I was 100 percent serious about dying\\". He was found by his Mad TV co-stars and taken to intensive care. Lange returned to New Jersey to complete a rehabilitation and counselling program. At its conclusion, he wrote a new forty-five minute stand up set that he felt \\"really proud of\\", and used his Mad TV fame to headline spots in comedy clubs around New York City, supported by further voiceover work for commercials. In January 1996, Lange returned to Los Angeles to film the remaining episodes of the first season. Quincy Jones, the show's producer, supported Lange during rehab and sent him over on his private jet. Lange returned to form in his work, ranking his performance in these episodes as \\"the best I've ever done in sketch comedy\\", including the creation of his hit character, White Mama. In the summer of 1996, Lange secured his first major acting role for an independent film titled Puppet, starring Rebecca Gayheart and Fred Weller. He wrote, \\"To this day I have never seen it because I don't think it's possible to purchase a copy of it anywhere ... it was screened in a theater at least once, because my manager went to see it\\". Filming for the second season of Mad TV began in August 1996. Two months later, Lange ended his sobriety and returned to doing cocaine. His time on the show ended in November 1996 when his agent and the show's cast and crew attempted an intervention. The incident began when Lange lost a $15,000 bet on the Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield boxing match and turned up to rehearsals \\"coked up\\". Lange fled the set, running through streets with his co-workers chasing him. It ended in the parking lot of a supermarket where Lange was arrested and served a short time in Los Angeles County Jail. The case was never tried in court. While in jail, Lange received a voice mail from Cameron Crowe who informed him that his scene with Tom Cruise and Kelly Preston for Jerry Maguire had been cut. After his jail term, Lange returned to New Jersey in January 1997 and spent a short time in a psychiatric hospital. He described this time as the \\"most depressing period\\" of his life. He returned home afterwards, and fell into a clinical depression. After the producers at Mad TV convinced Lange to complete formal rehabilitation, he spent two months at Honesty House in Stirling, New Jersey. Lange's contract was not renewed for the show's third season, but he made special guest appearances on the fifth, tenth, and fourteenth seasons.  1997‚Äì2001: Dirty Work and The Norm Show  In 1997, Lange left rehab and resumed stand up gigs in New York City. His depression improved soon after when he was invited to audition for two network television sitcoms, which boosted his confidence \\"astronomically\\". During the negotiations phase, Lange was contacted by comedian and actor Norm Macdonald, who asked him to audition for the second lead role in his comedy buddy film Dirty Work (1998), directed by Bob Saget. Macdonald had not found a suitable actor for the part until he happened to tune into an episode of Mad TV for the first time. He saw a sketch that involved Lange delivering an out of character monologue which he found funny, and noted Lange \\"had a melancholy about him\\" that reminded Macdonald of comedian John Belushi. Macdonald recalled Lange's first reading of the script as \\"perfect\\", which landed him the role, but in order to shoot the film, MGM studios required Lange to obtain an approval report from his rehab facility in New Jersey. Lange settled the matter by paying the center $1,500 as a private donor. He stopped his cocaine use on June 14, 1997, saying he \\"got tired of it. I got to a point where this is killing me\\". Filming took place across two months in Toronto. To promote the film, Lange made his debut guest appearance on The Howard Stern Show with Macdonald on January 8, 1998. The pair returned once more that year, and twice more in 1999.The Howard Stern Show broadcast for June 9, 1998 and March 22 and September 22, 1999. WXRK-FM New York City. Infinity Broadcasting. Lange credits Macdonald and Saget with rejuvenating his career when his exposure from Dirty Work led to several film and television offers. When filming wrapped, various heads of networks and production companies expressed an interest in potentially hiring Lange. After meeting with them, including Warren Littlefield of NBC and Peter Roth of Fox, a bidding war occurred, with offers coming in from every major network. With help from William Morris Agency, Lange accepted a $750,000 development deal with Fox that originally stood at $250,000 in late 1997, enabling him \\"to bail my mother out of every single financial debt she had.\\" None of Lange's ideas for a show were picked up, but he supported himself by working at comedy clubs around Los Angeles. He also landed a role in a pilot television series which he co-wrote with Sam Cass, in April 1998, subsequently re-written by request from the network. Its title was The King of New York which included Luis Guzm√°n in its cast. Lange felt the idea was ignored and suddenly pushed through for shooting at the last minute, which affected its quality. Weeks later, Lange accepted a second development deal, this time with NBC worth $350,000. From 1999 to 2000, Lange secured roles in the feature films Mystery Men, The Bachelor, The 4th Floor, and Lost & Found. He also toured as the opening act to Macdonald's stand-up shows. In 1999, Lange joined the cast of Macdonald's sitcom The Norm Show during its second season as Macdonald's half brother, Artie. Lange stayed with the show until its cancellation in 2001 after three seasons. He enjoyed a period of wealth during this time, being paid $35,000 per episode for a show with \\"ridiculously lame, easy jokes\\", liked working with his castmates (particularly MacDonald and Laurie Metcalf, who would later portray his mother in Beer League) and lived in a $4,000-a-month condo in Beverly Hills. \\"Even with that life\\", Lange added, \\"creatively I was empty inside\\". During a 2014 interview with Marc Maron, Lange said that this creative frustration drove him to perform more stand-up comedy as he \\"came into his own as a comedian\\" by introducing more \\"dark,\\" edgy material into his act. http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_458_-_artie_lange  2001‚Äì2008: The Howard Stern Show and Artie Lange's Beer League  In March 2001, comedian and writer Jackie Martling left The Howard Stern Show. Stern announced a \\"Win Jackie's Money\\" contest and had several comedians audition for the vacant seat by sitting in on some shows. Participants included Lange, Craig Gass, Doug Stanhope, Richard Jeni, Jeff Ross, Jim Florentine, and Ron Zimmerman. Lange was introduced to the show in 1982 by his father, and since became a big fan. He spoke about his invitation to take part in the contest: \\"There were a lot of great funny guys ‚Äî guys that were funnier than me ... I remember saying to my manager, 'I am not the most talented guy in this group, but I guarantee that I'm the biggest fan'\\". After The Norm Show ended in April 2001, Lange returned to New Jersey and sat in on several shows between May and October 2001. Lange thought he blew his chance early on after he learned the jokes he was writing for Stern were not working out. \\"Instead they said, 'We're just gonna keep your mic on all the time ... if you say something funny, just say it as you.\\" Lange built a rapport with Stern, the show's staff, and the audience. One news reporter credited Lange's \\"everyman demeanor ... relatable to the average Joe\\"; another wrote: \\"a kind of comic Everyman, the person who says what the listener at home might be thinking\\". Lange was prepared to return to Los Angeles if he did not land the job, but he accepted a contract to join the show full-time which began from October 29, 2001, describing the offer as a \\"blessing\\". In the following years after joining The Howard Stern Show, Lange's career reached new heights, playing larger venues and various career film and television opportunities. In June 2002, he signed with the United Talent Agency. Around this time, Lange teamed with producer and writer Sam Simon for a comedy show pilot for DreamWorks to air on NBC but it never materialised. In September 2003, Lange scored a one-year talent holding deal with ABC and Touchstone Television. When Stern had announced his departure from terrestrial radio for Sirius Satellite Radio in late 2004, Infinity Broadcasting offered Lange a four-year deal worth $20 million to replace Stern on WXRK-FM, with producer Gary Dell'Abate as producer. Both turned down the offer. On December 13, 2004, Lange released his first stand-up DVD titled It's the Whiskey Talkin, formed of 45 minutes of material he performed at the Tempe Improv in Tempe, Arizona a time in his career when he was \\"playing more clubs\\". Lange later spoke about the release: \\"I worked really hard on that ... a major distributor put it out, people bought it and seemed to like it\\". Upon the DVD's general release in February 2005, Lange took on \\"an insane schedule\\" for the following six months to promote it, doing The Howard Stern Show each weekday morning, and stand up gigs nationwide on weekends. In March 2005, Lange secured a deal with Ckrush Entertainment to star in and executive produce his own comedy feature film, Artie Lange's Beer League. Development began in 2001 when Lange started on a script with director and producer Frank Sebastiano, based on a 17-minute film Lange wrote, funded and starred in 2000 titled Game Day. The script was complete by 2002, and Ckrush agreed to fund a $2.5 million budget. The stress of putting the film together, and doing nationwide gigs on weekends, caused Lange to drink heavily and take \\"twenty painkillers a day\\". His attempts to cope from withdrawals failed - during one attempt to obtain more at a comedy gig, he instead bought heroin which began an addiction that lasted from March to June 2005, resulting in his absence from cast auditions and pre-production meetings. Lange took four days off work in June 2005 to get through the illness caused by withdrawals at home, which prompted concerns from his family and radio colleagues of a drug relapse. When Sebastiano and production staff threatened to cancel the film if he did not show up, Lange obtained Subutex from a doctor that got him well enough to return to work. On the air, Lange put his absence down to illness from excessive drinking. Filming was complete in July 2005, on time and within budget. It premiered on September 13, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre, followed by a limited release across North America. To promote the film, Lange completed a stand-up tour which included a show at Carnegie Hall which sold out in under three hours. He revealed the true reason of his absence to Stern on September 21, 2006.  2008‚Äì2009: Various projects and Stern Show departure  In June 2008, Lange headlined a comedy tour he formed, named Operation Mirth, with the United Service Organizations to entertain American troops serving in Afghanistan. He was inspired to do so after watching Patriot Act: A Jeffrey Ross Home Movie, a documentary about comedian Jeffrey Ross' own USO tour in Iraq. Lange picked comedians Jim Florentine, Nick DiPaolo, and Dave Attell to join him, with The Howard Stern Show's producer Gary Dell'Abate as the tour's master of ceremonies. Later in the year, Lange and Attell recorded dialogue for the video game Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust, released in 2009. In August 2008, Lange entered rehab after he cancelled his appearance on the Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget. He had relapsed in heroin use in the previous seven weeks after he was offered it while drunk at a pool hall. Comedy Central was willing to cover the $65,000 in costs to send an ambulance for him to the airport and fly him to Los Angeles on a private jet with a doctor, but Lange declined and began treatment with a therapist recommended by comedian Richard Lewis, who contacted Lange to help.Lange; Bozza, \\"Greetings from Sunny Kandahar\\" In 2008, Lange signed a deal with Spiegel & Grau to write his first book Too Fat to Fish, a collection of memoirs across his life co-written by Anthony Bozza that \\"range from funny to dark, to tragic, to sad.\\" Lange dedicated the book to Stern who wrote its foreword. Upon its release on November 11, 2008, Too Fat to Fish entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number one and held the position for one week. The book remained on the list's top ten for eleven weeks. It was referenced twice on the Top Ten List segment on Late Show with David Letterman. A paperback edition released in 2009 with an additional chapter, peaked at number six on the Best Seller paperback list. By 2009, Lange was earning $700,000 a year for working with Stern and roughly $3 million a year from stand up gigs. In January 2009, Lange went to West Palm Beach, Florida to complete a 21-day rehab program after he had relapsed on heroin the month prior. After seven days, he quit treatment and spent almost $4,800 on a hotel room, women, a haircut and two pairs of sunglasses. He returned home and booked three nights at Caroline's comedy club in the same week, earning $35,000 back. Lange relapsed on heroin once more in April 2009. To help him cope with withdrawals, Lange hired two former New York City police officers for support in his recovery and lost 50 lbs in the following six months. He later revealed a $200,000 offer to appear on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew that he had declined. On June 15, 2009, Lange made a controversial appearance on the first episode of Joe Buck Live, exchanging insults with host Joe Buck that HBO Sports president Ross Greenburg said \\"bordered on bad taste\\" with a \\"mean-spirited\\" tone. The show was cancelled two episodes later. Buck defended Lange's comments and wrote the foreword to his second book. In July 2009, Lange was charged of driving under the influence of an intoxicant and careless driving after he became involved in a minor traffic accident in New Jersey. In October 2009, Lange took one week off from The Howard Stern Show, citing depression and a \\"mini nervous breakdown\\". His second stand up DVD and CD, Jack and Coke, was released a month later. Lange recorded the set at Gotham Comedy Club in New York City earlier in the year, and is composed of material that Lange had written over the past four years of his career, some of which dated back to 15 years, which Lange developed further and felt it was suitable to put on a recording. Jack and Coke reached number one on the iTunes Comedy Albums chart and entered its Top 20 Albums chart. It was also released as a DVD, which Comedy Central aired as a special in January 2010. In November 2009, Lange cancelled his stand-up gigs booked for rest of the year and throughout 2010. He felt \\"really beat\\" from work and needed time to recover from his heroin relapse that April, write new stand-up material, and work on a second book, which he had begun writing under the working title College Is for Losers. In an interview around this time Lange said, \\"The combination of the road and morning radio hasn't killed me, but it's come close. If I keep doing it, it will\\". The situation culminated on December 9, 2009, when Lange showed up to The Howard Stern Show having spent the previous seven hours drinking whiskey and taking painkillers, which affected his performance on the air. During a commercial break, Sirius management told Lange to go home; he was granted time off from the show. He voluntarily checked in at a rehab facility on Long Island to cope with withdrawals, but he \\"hated everything about it\\", and left eight days later, on December 23. Upon his return home, Lange spent the next several days in his apartment on an alcohol and pill binge.  2010‚Äì2014: Suicide attempt, radio show and second book  On January 2, 2010, Lange attempted suicide for the second time at his home by drinking bleach, slitting his wrists, and stabbing himself in the abdomen nine times with a 13-inch kitchen knife. He was found on the floor by his mother who, unbeknownst to him, was outside planning an intervention for him with his sister, two uncles, and friend and comedian Colin Quinn. Lange was taken to a hospital for surgery,Hammerstein, BJ (January 9, 2010). \\"Artie Lange out of the hospital\\". Detroit Free Press. and was transferred to a psychiatric ward a week later. An executive for SiriusXM stated that Lange would be welcomed back onto The Howard Stern Show following his recovery,Itzkoff, Dave (January 8, 2010). \\"'Howard Stern Show' to Keep Artie Lange.\\" The New York Times but Stern later decided against it, thinking it would not aid in his recovery. Lange entered a period of depression, spending most of his time at home. On September 27, 2010, eight months after the incident, Lange performed his first stand up routine as a surprise guest at the Comedy Cellar in New York City to a positive reception. The death of comedian Greg Giraldo from a drug overdose two days later sent Lange back into a depression, at a time when he considered a \\"return to society\\". In April 2011, after showing no signs of improvement, Lange was forced into a detox facility in New Jersey by Quinn and \\"two huge Irish guys\\". Lange wrote, \\"It was an abduction, which was exactly what I needed ... they dragged me, literally kicking and screaming\\". After three weeks at the facility, Lange was transferred to Ambrosia Treatment Center in Florida for two-and-a-half months, where he completed the program. Bruce Springsteen, one of Lange's favorite artists, contacted him personally during the process for support. Lange has since had \\"four or five\\" relapses between painkillers following an injury, alcohol and gambling, and continues to smoke. Initially, he denied the incident was a suicide attempt as he felt embarrassed to say it was his second, but while writing about the event and subsequent therapy, he realized, \\"I need to be honest with myself.\\" In July 2011, Lange had recovered enough to resume his career. His first endeavor took place on July 6 as co-host on a one off radio show on Fox Sports Radio with comedian Nick Di Paolo as a stand in for Tony Bruno. The show turned out to be a test show after Di Paolo accepted a deal to host a late night sports comedy program on DirecTV, and chose Lange as his co-host. On October 3, 2011, The Nick & Artie Show launched on approximately 30 stations nationwide and on SiriusXM. After Di Paolo left the show in January 2013, the show was renamed to The Artie Lange Show and Lange hired retired American football player Jon Ritchie as his co-host. On April 28, 2014, Lange announced the show would no longer air after that day. In 2013, Lange accepted an $800,000 advance from Touchstone Books to write his second book. Lange agreed to the project primarily for the money, but also wished to put out something that would help others who struggle with drug abuse. He wrote the book, titled Crash and Burn, with Bozza returning as his co-author, which covers his life and career during his final years on The Howard Stern Show, his second suicide attempt and the resulting depression, and his recovery. Lange later declared the book as, \\"The most honest thing I've ever done in my life\\". Following its release on October 29, 2013, the book entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number 8 under combined print and e-book sales and number 12 under hardcover sales.  2014‚Äì2019: Podcast, third book, and Crashing  Following the cancellation of his DirecTV show, Lange focused some time on his comedy career. He recorded a one-hour special for Comedy Central titled The Stench of Failure that aired on October 18, 2014. On November 4, 2014, Lange sent out a series of tweets about a sexual fantasy between him and ESPN sportscaster Cari Champion set during slavery times. He was Thomas Jefferson and Champion was a slave, and he attempts to whip her but fails. She beats him up and escapes. As a result, Lange received a lifetime ban from ESPN and Comedy Central cancelled a scheduled appearance. On January 5, 2015, Lange launched an uncensored subscription-based podcast titled The Artie Quitter Podcast. He records episodes mainly from his home in Hoboken, New Jersey. Lange estimated the podcast gained \\"about 9,000\\" subscribers in its first year. In May 2017, Lange stated the podcast would end after 400 episodes in order to tend to his comedy, filming Crashing, and his third book. He aimed to resume the podcast around September 2017, either at a cheaper subscription rate or free with advertisements. In 2015, Lange made a return to television after he secured roles on two shows. He made two guest appearances on The Jim Gaffigan Show in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and was chosen to star in a pilot episode for a new HBO comedy series titled Crashing, starring Pete Holmes with producer and editor Judd Apatow. After the series was picked up, filming began in November 2015 with Lange in a recurring role playing a loose version of himself. The remaining episodes were shot through 2016, and the title of the first is \\"Artie Lange\\". Lange revealed he was paid $15,000 per episode. During this time, Lange recorded a scene for a special reunion episode of Mad TV. Crashing premiered in February 2017; to help promote it, Lange completed a stand-up and media tour with Holmes and Apatow. He revealed his salary of $17,500 per episode on season two. In December 2015, Lange started on his third book with Bozza. Their publisher required the pair to produce a 25-page proposal for it before a contract was offered; they wrote one titled The Gambler: A Degenerate's Guide to Living on the Edge. The piece was well received and a deal with the publisher was made. Wanna Bet?: A Degenerate Gambler's Guide to Living on the Edge was released in July 2018. On September 5, 2017, Lange co- hosted his new show, The Artie and Anthony Show, with Anthony Cumia on the latter's online subscription-based network Compound Media. Cumia had hosted The Anthony Cumia Show for three years by himself until he decided to bring in a co-host. Lange was absent from the show for six weeks following his December 2017 arrest and subsequent time in rehab; he returned full-time on January 22, 2018. Cumia announced Lange's departure on May 14, 2018 for the foreseeable future due to his ongoing health and legal issues. In 2018, Among Lange's potential projects included the development of a film, a sitcom, and an animated series. Arrests and rehabilitation On March 12, 2017, Lange was arrested on three charges for possession of heroin, cocaine and drug paraphernalia in his car and on himself, in the parking garage of his apartment complex. He was released on a summons with a set court appearance. Three days prior to his arrest, Apatow and HBO offered Lange a buddy comedy- type show and a raise in salary, but Lange claimed he was fired from the second season of Crashing in the wake of the incident. However, Apatow maintained this was not the case and Lange revealed he is \\"still a Crashing employee\\". On April 5, Lange's original charges were downgraded to three \\"disorderly persons\\" offences, equivalent to misdemeanors, as he was not in the car where the drugs were found. Lange failed to appear in court due to miscommunication from his lawyer, resulting in a bench warrant issued by the court. The situation culminated in Lange's arrest on December 12 when he failed to appear in court in response to an additional arrest on May 12 when he was caught at high speed with a bag of heroin on his lap. On December 15, Lange pleaded guilty to possessing 81 bags of heroin in exchange for the earlier charge of possession of cocaine being dropped. He then checked himself into rehab on a private jet paid for by two fellow comics. Lange left rehab in January 2018, and began an outpatient rehab program for five days a week with regular urine tests. He reasoned his drug relapse down to anger. On June 1, 2018, Lange was sentenced to four years of probation with orders to complete 50 hours of community service and complete further outpatient rehabilitation. On July 7, 2017, Lange was rushed to a hospital and had emergency surgery in his chest after he collapsed after performing stand-up in Chicago, and claimed he was hours from death. In November 2018, Lange announced his decision to enter inpatient rehabilitation with comedian Bob Levy, after breaking his four-year probation by testing positive twice for cocaine and opioids. On several occasions he left rehab to perform stand-up comedy gigs before returning to the facility on the same night. On January 30, 2019, Lange was placed into custody for possession of a controlled substance and checked into a treatment center. In April 2019, comedian Russ Meneve filmed Lange carrying out court-ordered community work as a trash collector and posted it online. A month later, Lange posted a tweet which revealed he had moved on to work at a gas station. On May 21, Lange was arrested on a drug court warrant for violating the conditions of his probation program. On June 10, after 21 days in jail, he was released and began a new in-patient program. Radar Online reported in August 2019 that Lange was progressing in rehab and will remain at least through September. He is scheduled to return to a New Jersey court where a jail sentence is still possible. On September 10, 2019, Lange left rehab and announced that had been sober for more than seven months. On January 30, 2020, Lange announced that he had been sober for one year. 2019‚Äìpresent: Resuming career, new podcast After being released from rehab, Lange performed his first stand-up routine that night at the Comedy Cellar in New York City. He then resumed regular stand-up gigs in the local area. He announced that he had written a fourth memoir while in rehab, tentatively named Rippin' & Runnin': Life on Drug Court. On September 20, 2019, Lange announced that he had signed a deal to start a new podcast. Artie Lange's Halfway House premiered on December 2, 2019 and is available on audio and video through The Comics' Gym network. It features comedian Mike Bocchetti as co-host. The last Artie Lange's Halfway House was released on February 7, 2020. Lange indicated the podcast would go on hiatus, and return in March 2020.  Personal life  From 2002 to 2006, Lange was in a relationship with Dana Cironi. He met his future fianc√©e Adrienne Ockrymiek in 2009 at a tanning salon; they broke up in 2014. Since 2001, Lange has lived in a penthouse in Hoboken, New Jersey, which he bought for $620,000. In 2008, he bought a 7,000 square-foot summer home in Toms River, New Jersey, for $2.5 million with one of the rooms renovated by the Man Caves television crew. He put the home on the market in 2010; it was sold in 2016. Lange does not consider himself a liberal, though he is pro- choice, a supporter of gay rights, and a supporter of unions owing to his former career as a longshoreman. In 2017, Artie Lange voiced his support for President Donald Trump during an episode of his Artie the Quitter podcast. He has since voiced his support for Donald Trump on several occasions. He has stated that as a convicted felon, he cannot vote. In 2007, the New York City bakery Crumbs began to sell a vanilla and chocolate cupcake named Artie Lange which he designed himself, with proceeds going towards LIFEbeat, a HIV/AIDS charity. In March 2008, LIFEbeat refused to accept further donations after Lange used a variety of anti-gay epithets towards a co-worker with whom he was arguing on-air, although they later reached an amicable truce. In 2013, he said he felt \\"ashamed and embarrassed\\" by his previous use of anti-gay slurs in his comedy career and, while maintaining that he was never motivated by hatred and that he \\"still makes jokes about every group of people that there is\\", he is now more responsible when joking about such sensitive subjects and avoids slurs, saying \\"if someone came to me and told me that something I said caused some kid to commit suicide, I'd be in a nuthouse for the rest of my life, I really would.\\" In the early 2010s, Lange was diagnosed with diabetes and requires daily insulin injections.

They were composed of over seven thousand volunteers, mainly Napoleonic War veterans from Great Britain and Ireland, as well as some German veterans and some locals recruited after arriving in South America. Volunteers in the British Legion were motivated by a combination of both genuine political motives and mercenary motives.Brown p. 210 Their greatest achievements were at the Boyac√° (1819), Carabobo (1821), Pichincha (1822) and Battle of Ayacucho (1824) which secured independence for Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru from Spanish rule respectively. Background At the end of the Napoleonic Wars the British Empire no longer required a large standing army. In April 1817, The Times calculated that there were 500,000 ex-soldiers in a British population of 25 million. After a quarter-century of Continental wars‚Äîboth the wars against Revolutionary France and the Napoleonic Wars‚Äîthese men had no other employment history or trade and, therefore, often found themselves in poverty. South America's wars of independence from Spain provided many of them with an opportunity to continue their military careers and escape from the prospect of inactivity and poverty at home. Many Britons were still concerned by the threat that Spain, as a restored world power, potentially posed to Britain. Despite Spain and Britain having been allies in the Peninsular War just a few years before, many Britons' image of the Spanish in America was influenced by the now-disputed Black Legend. The motivations of volunteers for the British Legions varied. Volunteers were also motivated by the liberal propaganda of Simon Bol√≠var's supporters that portrayed the war as bringing freedom and rights to people under Spanish tyranny. For these reasons, particularly the former, the recruiting of British volunteers received tacit government support, even if in principle the British Crown discontinued its support to the insurgents after the Congress of Vienna in 1814. Mercenary interests also played a large part in motivating potential recruits, who were often unemployed, and perceived South America as a place where they would be able to continue to earn a living.Mitre, Bartolom√©: Historia de Belgrano. Imprenta de Mayo, Buenos Aires, 1859. V. II, page 321. Formation From May 1817, the British volunteers were mainly recruited in London by Bolivar's agent, Luis Lopez Mendez with the probable approval of the Duke of Wellington.Howgego pp. 556-57 The recruits were encouraged by promises of pay equivalent to the British army and by promotion to one rank above that which they had held in the army. Pay was to commence upon arrival in Venezuela and when the call was heard on the streets of London thousands began to volunteer for the expedition and soon the first five detachments were formed as follows: {  border=\\"2\\" !Early Formation !Number -  1st Venezuelan Hussars: Colonel Gustavus Hippisley  30 officers and 160 NCOs -  2nd Venezuelan Hussars (Red Hussars): Colonel Henry Wilson  20 officers and 100 NCOs -  1st Venezuelan Lancers: Colonel Robert Skeene  20 officers and 200 NCOs -  1st Venezuelan Rifles: Colonel Donald Campbell  37 officers and 200 NCOs -  Brigade of Artillery: Colonel Joseph Gilmour  10 officers and 80 NCOs 5 6-pounders, 1 5¬Ω howitzer - - style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" } Campaigns The soldiers used Margarita Island as their base.

In March 1819, Bolivar combined most of his foreign volunteers into a brigade of 250 men named the British Legions, with James Rooke as commander. George Elsom, who had formerly been an ensign with a militia regiment near London and who had sailed with Hippisley‚Äôs expedition, returned to London to recruit. Amongst his recruits were some 110 Hanoverians, who were commanded by John Uslar who saw action at Waterloo with the King‚Äôs German Legion.Hughes p. 187 In June 1819 Elsom arrived at the mouth of the Orinoco with the first wave of British troops. They numbered some 2,200 men equipped and uniformed, under the command of Captain George Gibson and twenty officers. This Second British Legion‚Äô as it became known consisted of the 1st British Legion led by Colonel James Towers English, the 2nd British Legion led by Colonel John Blossett, and the Irish Legion, led by Colonel William Aylmer (1772‚Äì1820). Colonel Arthur Sandes who commanded the Rifles The Legion adopted the motto Morir o vencer (Die or Conquer), as well as an anthem, composed to the tune of Ye Gentlemen of England which was continually played by the Legion‚Äôs band.Rodriguez p. 131 The uniforms were similar to those worn by the British army which had been supplied by the firm of Herring and Richardson who had also fitted out the ships. In Ireland a similar recruiting process took place. Led by John D‚ÄôEvereux who enlisted 1700 men which became known as the Irish Legion. The Rifle Battalion joined the same month which saw Bolivar reorganise his forces. The Rifles, reinforced by another 350 British troops who had recently arrived in South America, were then formed into two battalions. The first was to be commanded by Colonel Arthur Sandes and the second by Major John Mackintosh who would later become a military aide-de-camp to Simon Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre. The British Legions after months of inactivity joined Bolivar's army on the Plains of Apure towards the end of 1818 but saw no serious action until March 19, 1819, in a skirmish in the woods of Gamarra.Rodriguez p. 878 They would soon become an important part of Bol√≠var's army. They had to endure the secretive and brutal crossing of the Andes from May to June during which the Patriot army suffered greatly including the British.Hughes pp.169-71 They played a pivotal role however in the Vargas Swamp Battle on July 25. During this action Bolivar found himself in a difficult position; the left flank of the Patriot army was outflanked and withdrew in disorder. Rooke then led the 2nd Rifles against the Spanish positions on the hills. A ferocious bayonet charge regained the positions for the Patriots. Rooke fell mortally wounded while Sandes was also wounded twice. Despite heavy casualties the British troops distinguished themselves.Rodriguez p. 259, 354 At the Battle of Boyac√° on August 7, 1819, Sandes' Rifles Battalion led a bayonet charge on the royalist artillery which turned the tide of the battle. Bolivar credited them with the victory saying \\"those soldier- liberators are the men who deserve these laurels\\" Grant p. 560 They were awarded with the ‚ÄòOrder of the Liberator‚Äô one of the rare occasions during the war when this decoration was bestowed onto an entire unit. At the victory of Carabobo the legion troops were led by Colonel Thomas Ilderton Ferrier. They fought in the battle as part of the 1st Division, led by General Jose Antonio Paez. They defended strategically important hills while being greatly outnumbered and low on supplies; their heroic stand was the decisive moment of the day. They suffered 119 casualties, of those were two officers with Ferrier among the dead. Bol√≠var described the Legions and all who served in them as \\"the saviours of my country\\". As a reward for their service, they were given the Carabobo battle honour by the general staff of the Patriot forces, and all its personnel rewarded with the Liberators' Star by Bol√≠var himself, 20 days after the battle.Hughes p. 308 Ecuador and Per√∫ With the independence of Colombia and Venezuela secured, Bolivar and his patriot army along with the British Legions moved South to drive the Spanish out of Peru and Ecuador. They marched over the mountains again this time to a land of high volcanoes where they managed to force the Spanish to withdraw at the Battle of Bombon√° on April 7, 1822. The following month the Legions assisted Sucre's army and marched higher still to Quito standing at 9,300 feet in the mountains. There on 24 May 1822, they fought on the flanks of a volcano at the Battle of Pichincha. The battle could have turned into a rout if the British and Irish troops had not thwarted a dangerous flank attack by the veteran Spanish Arag√≥n battalion.Mackenzie p. 66 The victory at Pichincha for the Patriot army secured independence for Ecuador. They took part in the last major campaign of the Independence wars in Peru during 1824; British volunteers, including the 1st Rifles under Sandes, were present at the Battle of Junin in August and the Battle of Ayacucho in December which marked the end of Spanish rule in South America.Rodriguez p. 363 Aftermath The British Legions fought until the end of the wars, their number much depleted. Many of the survivors settled in the new states that they helped to create. For a long time they were largely forgotten to history. Bridge of Boyac√°.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The poet denies that his love is a form of idolatry and that the youth himself is an idol. He insists that he has been constantly devoted to the values of fairness, kindness and truth. Being three themes united in the figure of the youth, there is great scope for verse, since they have never been united in one person before. The language used is similar in some respects to the language in the Book of Common Prayer used to describe the Holy Trinity, and Shakespeare's triple repetition of the three attributes of the Fair Youth - \\"Three themes in one\\" - makes plain his deliberate comparison of the youth to a form of deity or idol, even as he purports not to engage in idolatry (in the sense of polytheistic worship of idols). Structure Sonnet 105 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 3rd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Since all alike my songs and praises be (105.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The sonnet embraces a large number of stresses in normally non-stressed positions. These appear as inversions and non-ictic stresses, both of which appear in line 10: √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words; (105.10) Here, both \\"fair\\" and \\"kind\\" are fully stressed, but in a regular reading only \\"kind\\" is metrically marked, \\"fair\\" being a non-ictic stress. In contrast, \\"varying\\" (which the meter demands function as two syllables) is a mid-line inversion. Both variations recur several times in this sonnet. Context Sonnet 105 falls broadly into the group of Sonnets addressed to a \\"Fair Youth\\", which ranges from Sonnets 1-126. This group of sonnets address an unnamed youth who acted as the object of Shakespeare's love. The nature of that love has often been debated, namely whether it was romantic or platonic in nature, The consensus is generally that they are more romantic in nature, judging by the classic romantic language used in Sonnets like the famous 18th (\\"shall I compare thee to a Summer's day\\"), and the poet's lamentation that the youth was not born a woman in Sonnet 20. The youth's identity is also often disputed, and his true identity is not known for certain. However, one of the more probable candidates is that of Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton. This theory states that the Earl, one of Shakespeare's patrons, became the subject of Shakespeare's love, and the majority of the Sonnets are addressed to him. More specifically, Sonnet 105 occupies a group of sonnets within the Fair Youth sequence, from 97 to 105, that seem to indicate happiness at the return of Shakespeare's love, the addressee. In the group prior to this, the poet expressed sadness at his muse's extended absence. It appears, however, that the Fair Youth's return yielded a happier series of poems, in which Shakespeare describes the return of his muse and speaks of the youth with \\"a lighter heart, and once more exalts his virtues, truth and constancy\\" Massey, Gerald. Shakespeare's Sonnets Never Before Interpreted. New York, N.Y.: AMS, 1866 (reprinted 1973) For historians like Massey, the sonnet is mainly an honest expression of happiness and joy at the chance to return to the lofty romance language that defined his more melancholy period. Religious themes are also prevalent in this sonnet. The sonnets were published in 1609, composed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, who re-instituted The Anglican Church in England. One of the tenets of Protestantism was the belief that Catholic practices of worshiping the multitude of Saints and the Virgin Mary were practices of idolatry and were henceforth blasphemous.Evans, G. Blakemore. The Sonnets: Updated Edition. New York, N.Y.: Cambridge University P, 2006 Hence, Shakespeare's claim against idolatry indicates his love is always directed at the same youth. Other interpretations make the claim that the religious nature of the poem is ironic, that Shakespeare is well aware that the love he describes is indeed idolatry. Scholar Jane Roessner states that \\"the speaker seems done with all efforts to persuade; now the sonnets are set up at once to deceive and reveal: to appear to be genuine praises ... while in fact covertly revealing the corruption of the friend, and ultimately, of the sonnets themselves which had at first seemed to be stays against corruption\\".Roessner, Jane. Double Exposure: Shakespeare's Sonnets 100-114. ELH, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Autumn, 1979), pp. 357-378 Thus, the purpose behind the sonnet is one of intentional double standards. In addition, Shakespeare is playing with the religious perversity, using the Christian imagery as a way of describing his love.  Criticism  Sonnet 105 invokes a strongly religious tone and is read by most critics as decidedly Christian, as it denies claims of idolatry and strongly alludes to the trinity. In his analysis, Brian Gibbons emphasizes the importance of the speaker's denial of idolatry; the speaker is following the first two commandments by practicing monotheism and not building any other idols or images. However, the speaker fundamentally breaks the Third Commandment by taking the name of the Lord in vain; \\"unorthodox monotheism is in Christian terms blasphemous.\\" Gibbons views this oversight on the part of the poet as convenient and intentional rather than accidental.Gibbons, Brian, and A.R. Braunmuller, eds. The New Cambridge Shakespeare. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984. 201-202. Print. Like Gibbons, Eugene Wright views this sonnet with a Christian lens, noting that the poet uses familiar Christian rhetoric and imagery to appeal to the reader. However, he argues that the speaker is not guilty of blasphemy because it is not the youth being praised, but the \\"qualities of 'Fair, kind, and true,' transcendent qualities the young man partakes of.\\" According to Wright, the main idea of the poem is unity - the unity of the three qualities in the persona, never before seen in a strictly mortal man. The emphasis on three-in- one is not meant to replace the trinity or suggest that the beloved is divine or equivalent to Christ, but to echo the unity of the virtues and to evoke an image of perfection.Wright, Eugene Patrick. The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1993. 267-268. Print. Carl Atkins' analysis undermines some of the more popular interpretations of this sonnet, largely because he emphasizes the possibility that the poet and the male beloved (or \\"Fair Youth\\") had a passionate but platonic friendship, devoid of sexual tension. Like Wright and Gibbons, Atkins picks up on the Christian imagery and emphasis on \\"fair, kind, and true\\" throughout the poem. However, he reads this sonnet through a more secular lens and stresses the speaker's love for his friend more than the poem's religious tone. The repetition of \\"fair, kind, and true\\" serve as a kind of method for making the beloved embody those virtues in the speaker's mind, if not in actuality. He defends this argument by pointing out the several preceding sonnets in which the beloved is distinctly not fair, kind, or true. Atkins' criticism also focuses on the illogicality of the speaker considering his love to be monotheistic and not idolatrous. He argues that the claim of a monotheism is \\"a very poor counter to an accusation of idolatry.\\" The speaker in fact practices idolatry by praising his beloved as if the friend were a deity.Atkins, Carl D., ed.

(Modern Turkish: Aydƒ±noƒülu Umur Bey, c. 1309‚Äì1348), also known as Umur Pasha was the second Emir of Aydin, on the Aegean cost of Anatolia, from 1334 to 1348. He was famous for his naval expeditions. As a writer, poet and patron of the arts and sciences, Kalila wa- Dimna was first translated to Persian during his reign. Umur was described in an epic chronicle D√ºst√ºrn√¢me-i Enver√Æ, written by poet and historian Enveri during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II, as \\"the 'Lion of God' leading a just and holy war of conquest against the 'miscreants' and infidel Christians\\".

They had found him wearing silks, drinking almond milk and eating eggs with spices from a golden spoon. Umur Ghazi was a loyal ally and friend of Emperor John Cantacuzenus of the Byzantine Empire and provided him with material aid during his military campaigns, especially during the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì1347.Nicol, Last Centuries, p. 202 He apparently sent 380 ships and 28,000 men to aid him in the conflict and besieged the city of Demotika in Thrace, Greece.Najeebabadi, History of Islam Vol.3, p.374-375 The emperor John reportedly mourned his death.Nicol, Last Centuries, p. 203 At the height of its power, the Emirate of Aydin possessed 350 ships and 15,000 men.

In 1348, his fleet was destroyed by an allied fleet from Venice, the Knights of Rhodes and Cyprus.

Carrington made a handful of appearances the following season and saw a more regular place in the team with the arrival of new manager Gu√∞j√≥n √û√≥r√∞arson in the 2008‚Äì09 season, and managed to score his first two goals for the club as a professional, in which his first goal came on 31 January 2009, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Tranmere Rovers. One of those goals being against his future club MK Dons in March 2009, and from that game Carrington earned praise from Steve Claridge in his Scouting Report for the Guardian. Having missed the last few games of the season with an injury, Carrington left the club when his contract expired in June 2009. Milton Keynes Dons On 21 July 2009, Paul Ince signed Mark Carrington on a two-year contract for Milton Keynes Dons. After scoring in the pre-season friendly against Rushden & Diamonds, Carrington made his Milton Keynes Dons' debut in the opening game of the season, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Hartlepool United and scored his first league goal for MK Dons against Colchester United two weeks on 22 August 2009. As the season progressed his game developed under the guidance of Ince, and although his starts were limited, he continued to impress when selected, and earned particular praise from the former England midfielder after scoring twice in the 3‚Äì1 win against Southend United on 20 February 2010. Carrington then scored his fourth goal for the club on 6 March 2010, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Leyton Orient and finished the 2009‚Äì10 season, making nineteen appearance and scoring two times. With the replacement of Ince by Karl Robinson in the summer of 2010,and the arrival at MK of former England Assistant Manager John Gorman, Carrington continued to improve under John's guidance. Chances were limited however at the beginning of the season due to the signing of Dietmar Hamann. But the departure of Alex Rae to Notts County at the end of Oct 2010 saw Hamann move more into coaching, and Carrington featured in more games, helping Dons to their first away win of the season at Brentford in mid‚ÄìNovember. Hamann quoted at the time 'one of the reason's for me taking a step back from playing was Mark Carrington's form, it was harsh leaving him out, so my move to coaching has given him a chance to play on a more regular basis and he has been excellent'. With a handful of first team appearances, Carrington scored his first Milton Keynes Dons' goal of the season, in a 4‚Äì1 loss against Sheffield Wednesday on 20 November 2010. However, with the return of Gleeson from injury, Carrington again found his chances limited and decided to leave MK Dons in the January transfer window, but not before scoring for them after coming on in the 81st minute against Dagenham & Redbridge to earn MK Dons a 1‚Äì0 win and three vital points towards their push for promotion. In a bid to play more regularly Carrington opted for a chance to play in the Scottish Premier League until the end of the season, where he put in some good performances against Celtic and Rangers. Hamilton Academical On 1 February 2011, Carrington joined Scottish club strugglers Hamilton Academical for four months until the end of the season, after leaving the Milton Keynes Dons by mutual consent. Upon joining the club, Carrington revealed he tried to persuade Milton Keynes Dons to release him despite their reluctance. The next day, Carrington made his debut for Hamilton before coming off for Aaron Wildig on a 57th minutes in a 2‚Äì0 loss against St Johnstone on 2 February 2011.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9383805.stm Carrington made 11 more appearance for the club and was subsequently released by Hamilton following their relegation from the SPL. Bury After leaving Hamilton Academical, Carrington returned to England, where he joined Bury on trial and after three weeks with the club, Carrington joined on a short term non-contract deal after spending three weeks on trial with the club on 29 September 2011. After signing for the club, Carrington suffered endured a frustrating period on the sidelines after developing a blood clot in his leg which delayed his debut. Carrington had to wait until 17 December 2011 for his debut for the Shakers against Brentford in a 1‚Äì1 draw. His good performance at Bury after making three more appearance for Bury soon earned a deal until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 21 April 2012, Carrington scored his first goal for the club in a 4‚Äì2 win over Notts County. After making 21 appearance and scoring once in his first season, Carrington signed a new one-year contract with Bury which will keep until 2013.

The organization mobilizes designers to transform communities by putting design in the service of the public good The organization is the leading advocate and facilitator of pro bono practice in the design field through The 1% program. Public Architecture also takes on its own projects that expand the social relevance of design, including a prototypical station for day laborers, open space strategies, and advocacy around the issue of material reuse. The organization has partnered with and worked for a number of renowned nonprofits, including KIPP Schools, International Planned Parenthood, United Way and Habitat for Humanity. The organization's work has been featured in the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Huffington Post, GOOD, Dwell, Architect, Metropolis, and many others. Public Architecture was founded in 2002 by architect John Peterson of Peterson Architects.  The 1% program of Public Architecture  The 1% program is a call to action for professionals of the built environment to pledge a minimum of 1% of their time to pro bono service. Through The 1% website, firms can identity and locate nonprofits across the country in need of design services. Conversely, nonprofits enrolled in the program can find designers in their area willing to give of their time. As the program grows, it aims to connect design firms, nonprofits, manufacturers, and funders to collaborate and improve the infrastructure of America's nonprofits. In March 2011, the program had over 900 participating firms, donating $28million in design services annually. The firms range from sole practitioners to some of the largest firms in the country, including Gensler, HoK, and Perkins+Will. In October 2010, Public Architecture released The Power of Pro Bono: 40 Stories of Design for the Public Good by Architects and Their Clients through Metropolis Books. Edited by longtime, former executive director, John Cary and Public Architecture, the book presents 40 pro bono design projects across the country. The clients include grassroots community organizations like the Homeless Prenatal Program of San Francisco, as well as national and international nonprofits, among them Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity, and KIPP Schools. These public-interest projects were designed by a range of award- winning practices, from SHoP Architects in New York and Studio Gang in Chicago, to young studios including Stephen Dalton Architects in Southern California and Hathorne Architects in Detroit, to some of the nation's largest firms. Scores of private donors, local community foundations and companies, and material and service donations made these projects possible. So have some of the most progressive funders in the country, ranging from Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation in New Orleans to the Robin Hood Foundation in New York. Taken as a whole, the selected works represent six general categories: Arts, Civic, Community, Education, Health and Housing.  Advocacy & Design Demonstration Projects   Day Labor Station  The Day Labor Station is a prototypical structure, which will be used to house day laborers as they wait for employers to provide them with temporary work. The Station is a flexible structure that is designed to be deployed at informal day labor locations. The structure utilizes green building materials and strategies and will exist primarily off-the-grid. The design is based on findings from a series of interviews with day laborers conducted by Public Architecture, and is meant to respond to the needs and desires of the day laborers as clients. The structure is designed to be flexible enough to serve various uses, including as an employment center, meeting space, and classroom, and become a prototype for similar conditions (i.e. 1-1 Day Labor Station-installation at AAO Benaki Museum curated by Lina Stergiou). A portion of the first prototype of the Day Labor Station is on display at the ‚ÄúDesign for the Other 90%‚Äù exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York from May 4 through September 23, 2007.  Sidewalk Plazas  The Sidewalk Plazas project is Public Architecture's proposal to create parking-space sized open spaces, increasing the amount of open and green space in San Francisco's former-light- industrial-turned-mixed-use South of Market Area and related urban areas across the country. This plan has earned support from the San Francisco Planning Department, Redevelopment Agency, and Transportation Authority, and funds are being sought to implement a series of Sidewalk Plazas along Folsom Street in SoMa.  ScrapHouse  ScrapHouse was temporary demonstration house, constructed and displayed in front of San Francisco City Hall as a part of World Environment Day in 2005. It was constructed completely from salvage materials donated by local businesses, and was built in six weeks by a volunteer work-force. Emmy Award-winning documentarian Anna Fitch conceived of the project, and filmed the entire process for a documentary film that aired on the National Geographic Channel in September 2006.

It is endemic to the dry deciduous forest, arid thorn forest, and scrubby woodland of Mexico‚Äôs Pacific coast. The flycatcher is an olive to gray-brown bird with a streaked, pale gray chest, white throat, black bill, dark gray feet, and dark brown wings. It is a skulking bird that typically remains hidden in the underbrush. It feeds by gleaning insects off of leaves and twigs that it spots from an exposed perch. The female lays approximately three eggs in a nest made in a shallow tree cavity. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1875 by ornithologist George Newbold Lawrence, who placed this species in the genus Myiarchus. However, in 1893 it was split from Myiarchus into the new, monotypic genus Deltarhynchus by Robert Ridgway because of its shorter and broader bill, more rounded wings, and partially streaked underparts. This change was upheld in 1901 by Richard Bowdler Sharpe and by subsequent authors. However, in 1977 ornithologist Melvin Alvah Traylor Jr., while upholding its status as a monotypic genus, said that the species should be lumped back into Myiarchus if its nesting habits were similar to those of that genus. These doubts were put to rest by Wesley Lanyon's research of the flycatcher in 1979, which confirmed the bird's placement in a monotypic genus. Deltarhynchus is similar to the genus Myiarchus, but is distinguished from it by a broader and shorter bill, more rounded wings, a different face pattern, pale cinnamon wing and tail edgings, voice, streaking on the chest, and the bird's skulking habits. The flammulated flycatcher's generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words delta, which means \\"delta-shaped\\" or, in this case, \\"wedge\\", and rhynchos, which means \\"beak\\". Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin word flammula, which means \\"little flame\\". The flycatcher has no subspecies. Description Flammulated flycatcher at Llano de Horno, Mexico. The flammulated flycatcher is approximately 6 to 6.5 inches (15-16.5 cm) in length and has a chunky body. Adult males and females are similar in plumage, with each possessing olive to a worn gray-brown upperparts and head. A whitish supraloral stripe and crescent are behind the bird's eyes. It also has a dusky lore. The throat is whitish and the chest is a pale gray with inconspicuous dusky streaking, while the belly and undertail coverts are a pale yellow. Additionally, this species has dark brown, well-rounded wings with pale cinnamon-edged coverts and remiges. The wings are about long. The tail is also a dark brown edged with a narrow band of pale cinnamon. It is barely shorter than the wing and slightly rounded. The bird's bill is black, broad, and triangular with a slightly paler base and about half the length of its head. The legs are a dark gray and end with large, curved, and sharp claws. It has an orange mouth and a brown eye. The juvenile is similar to the adult, although the tail has a broad band of pale cinnamon. Vocalization The flammulated flycatcher mostly sings from April to August, which includes its breeding season, and tends to remain hidden while singing. The song of the flycatcher is a plaintive whistle followed by a short but quick roll. It can also give a plaintive and slurred chew call, which is often sung three to five times in a descending series, as well as a squeaky chatter. Calls are the same for males and females and are given throughout the day to give a location, identify an individual, sound an alarm, and mark the limits of a territory, among other functions. During the breeding season, males give what is known as a dawn song every morning, which includes the calls chee-bee beet and churr-r- r-bee bee in alternation. Distribution and habitat This flycatcher is endemic to the Pacific lowlands of Mexico's western coast from Sinaloa to western Chiapas, while possibly extending into Guatemala, although this has not been confirmed. The total area that it lives in is estimated to be . Its range is discontinuous and it is found in low densities when present. It lives in dry deciduous forest, arid and semi-arid thorn forest, and scrubby woodland at about 1000‚Äì1400 meters (3280‚Äì4593 ft) above sea level. This species is non- migratory. Status The flammulated flycatcher is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List owing to its large range and the belief that the total population numbers over 10,000 individuals; however, no precise estimate on the bird's population exists. While the species is known to be uncommon in parts of its range, its population is not believed to be declining enough to pass the threshold of 30% in ten years or three generations necessary to be listed as near threatened, although the exact population trends also have not been quantified. Ecology and behavior This flycatcher is a sluggish and skulking species that usually remains in the underbrush. When excited either by an intruder or when attempting to attract a mate, this species raises the feathers on its crown to form what appears to be a crest; however, unlike the closely related genus Myiarchus, it does not bob its head while displaying the crest. Feeding The flammulated flycatcher forages by perching on an open branch and looking outward and downward for prey, which primarily consists of insects. Once it spots a potential meal, the flycatcher rapidly and directly flies at the insect, which is normally on the exposed upper surface of a leaf or twig. It hovers briefly before the insect before grabbing it in its beak and flying away to typically a new perch. Reproduction The flycatcher breeds around June of each year. It nests in shallow tree cavities that are surprisingly close to the ground, at approximately 90 centimeters above it. The nest is shaped like a cup and is composed of fine vegetable fibers, dried leaves, and shredded bark. Unlike the similar Myiarchus flycatchers, it does not use snakeskin or other materials to build its nest. The female lays three eggs that are creamy to pinkish in color and are decorated with brown and gray splotches.

Season summary Singles The year-end number one in 2000 and thus the No. 1 player as 2001 begun, Martina Hingis started the new season off well by winning the title at the Adidas International over nemesis Lindsay Davenport. The two looked like they might meet again in the Australian Open final: Hingis beat Venus Williams in her semifinal, but Davenport was then surprised by a resurgent Jennifer Capriati, who was enjoying a dream run to her first Grand Slam final. Going against the odds, Capriati also scalped Hingis to win her first ever Slam title and re-entered the top 10 in the rankings after a near- eight year absence, a record gap. Jennifer Capriati topped her comeback with her first and second Grand Slam titles during 2001, and a brief stay at No. 1 in October. Despite neither claiming the Australian Open, Hingis and Davenport continued to dominate proceedings for the rest of January and February. The two met again at the Toray Pan Pacific Open, with Davenport triumphing this time to win the title. Hingis won the inaugural events in the Middle East, the Qatar Total FinaElf Open and the Dubai Duty Free Women's Open, while Davenport was also victorious at the State Farm Classic. Meanwhile, Am√©lie Mauresmo claimed both titles in her home country of France, winning at the Open Gaz de France and the Internationaux de Tennis Feminin Nice; and Monica Seles provided a notable victory over in-form Capriati in the IGA US Indoors final. The Pacific Life Open saw an all-teen battle commence in its championship match, with 19-year-old Serena Williams reclaiming the title she first won in 1999 by beating 17-year-old Kim Clijsters in the final. Serena's older sister, Venus, responded by winning March's other big title, the Ericsson Open, surviving a nail-biter against Australian Open champion Capriati. As the clay court season begun in April, Mauresmo continued to enjoy a strong run of form to win her third straight title on the green clay courts of the Bausch & Lomb Championships. Her 16-match win streak, however, was stopped by Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Family Circle Cup--a tournament that saw Capriati win her first Tier I title since the Canadian Open in 1991, defeating Hingis in three sets. Moving on to the red clay courts, Venus Williams showed devastating form at the Betty Barclay Cup, losing just 12 games en route to the title. Mauresmo once again posted impressive results, taking down Hingis and Capriati to win the Eurocard German Open, and making the final at the Italian Open--only being stopped by Yugoslav teenager Jelena Dokiƒá who was enjoying a career best week to win her first ever singles title. Kim Clijsters finished the year at No. 5 in the world after a breakthrough year, including making her first Slam final. The French Open provided shocks from early on, with clay court standouts and favourites Mauresmo and Venus Williams both crashing out in the first round. The two upsets blew the bottom half of the draw wide open, allowing Kim Clijsters to reach her first major final, knocking out compatriot Justine Henin in the first all-Belgian semifinal in Grand Slam history. Over on the top half, things went more to plan, with Capriati and Hingis setting up a rematch of that year's Australian Open final. Capriati eased through that, but the final proved to be the bigger challenge. After being two points from defeat on numerous occasions, she eventually triumphed over Clijsters in a 12‚Äì10 third set to continue her faultless 14‚Äì0 record in Grand Slam play that year. Wimbledon also opened with an upset: World No. 1 Hingis crashed out in straight sets against Virginia Ruano Pascual, repeating her first round exit of 1999. Lindsay Davenport had returned to action on the grass after missing the entire clay season due to a right knee bone bruise, and instantly established herself as a threat with a title run at the Britannic Asset Championships. She easily advanced to the semifinals, before losing in a rematch of the 2000 final to Venus Williams. On the other side of the draw, Henin snapped Capriati's Grand Slam win streak to become the second straight Belgian player to compete in a major final. However, like Clijsters before her, she went down to the favourite, Williams, who became only the fourth woman in the Open era to win consecutive Wimbledon titles whilst winning her third Grand Slam overall. Americans players dominated their home turf during the summer hard court swing, with Venus Williams proving to be the standout player for the second straight year. Despite losing to Meghann Shaughnessy at the Bank of the West Classic, she won two events: the Acura Classic and Pilot Pen Tennis, allowing her to head into her US Open title defence on a 9-match winning streak. Davenport also stamped herself as a major contender with a 13‚Äì3 win-loss record during the American hard court tournaments, including a title at the estyle.com Classic. Meanwhile, Serena Williams won the other big US Open warm-up tournament, the Rogers AT&T; Cup. Lindsay Davenport won a tour-leading seven titles and finished the year as the No. 1 ranked player. That year's US Open provided the first ever all-Williams final between sisters Venus and Serena, after both upset the world's top two players in their respective semifinals, Hingis and Capriati. In a historic final that was the first woman's final to be played in prime time, Venus beat her little sister to defend her title and repeat the Wimbledon-US Open double she also did the previous year. It was the first all-sister final at a Grand Slam event since the 1884 Wimbledon Championships, between the Watson sisters, Maud and Lilian. Davenport proved to be the standout player during the indoor season, winning three tournaments in consecutive weeks: the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, the Swisscom Challenge and the Generali Ladies Linz, repeating the achievement she also did in 1998. Also performing well were Dokiƒá, who won two titles at the AIG Japan Open and the Kremlin Cup, just two results that capped off her breakthrough season with a rise into the top 10 in the world; and Seles, who finished her season with a 13-match winning streak. Meanwhile, World No. 579 Angelique Widjaja became the lowest-ranked player ever to win a Tour title at the place of her home tournament, the Wismilak International. Off-court, tour stalwarts Nathalie Tauziat and Anke Huber both announced their retirements from singles play. Elsewhere, Capriati ascended to the No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career on October 15 after an injury caused Hingis to be unable to defend her points from the previous year. Hingis, who had held the No. 1 ranking for the entire season to that point, was also forced to withdraw from the Sanex Championships. That year's Sanex Championships was also missing Venus Williams, who had to withdraw with a wrist injury. In her absence, sister Serena won the title despite not playing since her U.S. Open final loss to Venus, becoming the first player to win the year-ending championship in their debut appearance. Davenport made the final, but had to default to Williams due to a bone bruise. Nevertheless, with Capriati's quarterfinal loss to Sandrine Testud, Davenport's final appearance was enough for her to gain the No. 1 ranking by just 10 points, her second time in the year-end No. 1 position following 1998.

Since 1992 it has been an independent priory of Windberg Abbey in Lower Bavaria (Roggenburg Priory). The monastery manages a training centre and a museum, and is widely known for its almost unchanged Baroque building and the organ concerts that are held in the church. For over three centuries, Roggenburg was one of the 40-odd self-ruling imperial abbeys of the Holy Roman Empire and, as such, was a virtually independent state. Its abbot had seat and voice at the Imperial Diet where he sat on the Bench of the Prelates of Swabia. At the time of the abbey's dissolution in 1802, its territory covered 112 square kilometers and it had 3,300-5,000 subjects.http://www.historisches-lexikon- bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45346  History   First foundation  Roggenburg Abbey seen from the air Roggenburg Abbey, Baroque building Organ, originally by Schmahl Quire, Roggenburg Abbey church In 1126 Count Bertold of Bibereck, together with his wife and his two brothers, Konrad, Bishop of Chur, and Siegfried, a canon in the diocese of Augsburg, founded the monastery. The first Premonstratensian canons came from Ursberg Abbey nearby and built the first monastery church. In 1444 the foundation was raised to the status of an abbey. The first description of Roggenburg Abbey as reichsunmittelbar dates from 1482/5; the legal consolidation of this status took place in tiny stages over the first half of the 16th century. In the 18th century the abbey and its dependent churches were rebuilt in the Baroque style, as they are today. The conventual buildings were rebuilt in 1732. Construction of a new church began in 1752, and lasted six years. In 1802 the monastery was occupied by Bavarian troops during the secularisation of Bavaria, dissolved, and the last abbot, Thadd√§us Aigler, stripped of his office.  After dissolution  The abbey church became a parish church. The rest of the abbey's property passed into private ownership, except for the buildings, which were taken over by the Bavarian government. Until 1862 a district court and rent office were accommodated here. Later the buildings were used for a variety of functions, including as a school, a forestry office and a parochial office.  Second foundation  In 1986 Premonstratensians again occupied the premises. On 8 November 1992 the new community was raised to the status of an independent priory of Windberg Abbey. In the interval there had arisen a training centre for family, environment and culture, a museum and a centre for art and culture, as well as gastronomical facilities. In addition, the monastery shop sells devotional items, the monastery's own wine and various other products of their own manufacture.  Abbey church  The Baroque abbey church was built between 1752 and 1758 to plans by Simpert Kraemer in the shape of a cross. The hall church, with extended transept and double towers, is 70 metres long, 35 metres across and has an inside height, to the highest point, of 28 metres. Today it is used as the Roman Catholic parish church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary.  Organ  The great Baroque organ by the Ulm organ builder Georg Friedrich Schmahl of 1761 was completely replaced in 1905 by a Late Romantic construction by the Gebr√ºder Hindelang of Ebenhofen. This was replaced in its turn in 1955‚Äì56, with the reuse of some registers, by an instrument by the Familie Nenninger. In 1984‚Äì86 it was extensively rebuilt by Gerhard Schmid of Kaufbeuren. The appearance of the organ by Schmahl was preserved throughout all rebuildings.

The northern barred woodcreeper (D. sanctithomae) was formerly included in this species. The Amazonian barred woodcreeper still includes the subspecies concolor, which sometimes is considered a separate species, the concolor woodcreeper. It is found in the entire Amazon Basin of Brazil and the Guianas in the northeast, (Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana). The countries surrounding the basin at the Andes are southern Colombia and Venezuela, also Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. A disjunct population exists 1800 km east of the Amazon Basin in eastern coastal Brazil in the states of Para√≠ba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Sergipe in a 600 km coastal strip. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. Taxonomy The Amazonian barred woodcreeper was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from two specimens collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Picus certhia in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The Amazonian barred woodcreeper is now one of five woodcreepers placed in the genus Dendrocolaptes that was introduced by the French naturalist Johann Hermann in 1804. The generic name is from the Ancient Greek dendrokolaptƒìs meaning \\"woodpecker\\". The specific epithet certhia is from the Ancient Greek kerthios, a word used by Aristotle for an unidentified small insectivorous bird. Seven subspecies are recognised: * D. c. certhia (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì east Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil * D. c. radiolatus Sclater, PL & Salvin, 1868 ‚Äì southeast Colombia, east Ecuador, northeast Peru and northwest Brazil * D. c. juruanus von Ihering, H, 1905 ‚Äì east, southeast Peru, north, west, central Bolivia and west Brazil * D. c. concolor Pelzeln, 1868 ‚Äì northeast Bolivia and south central Brazil in the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s interfluvium * D. c. medius Todd, 1920 ‚Äì northeast Brazil south of the Amazon and east of the Tocantins River * D. c. retentus Batista et al., 2013 ‚Äì north central Brazil in the Xingu-Tocantins interfluvium * D. c. ridgwayi Hellmayr, 1905 ‚Äì northcentral Brazil in the Tapaj√≥s-Xingu interfluvium References External links *\\"Barred woodcreeper\\"-Dendrocolaptes certhia photo gallery VIREO *Photo-High Res- Dendrocolaptes certhia; Article-2; Article seplan.to.gov.br-\\"Flora and Fauna\\" Amazonian barred woodcreeper Category:Birds of the Amazon Basin Category:Birds of the Guianas Category:Birds of Brazil Amazonian barred woodcreeper Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Amazonian barred woodcreeper"},{"id":"12449042","text":"Dendrocolaptes is a genus of Neotropical birds in the Dendrocolaptinae subfamily.

With respect to Open System Interconnection model (OSI), J1708 defines the physical layer. Common higher layer protocols that operate on top of J1708 are SAE J1587 and SAE J1922. The protocol is maintained by SAE International. Description The standard defines a 2-wire 18 gauge wire cable that can run up to and operates at 9600 bit/s. A message is composed of up to 21 characters, unless the engine is stopped and the vehicle is not moving in which case transmitters are allowed to exceed the 21 byte max message length. Messages start with a Message ID (MID) character and finish with a checksum at the end. Characters are transmitted in the common 8N1 format. The hardware utilized are RS-485 transceivers wired for open collector operation through the use of a pullup and pulldown of the separate data lines. Transmission is accomplished by controlling the driver enable pin of the transceiver. This method allows multiple devices to share the bus without the need for a single master node. Collisions are avoided by monitoring the bus while transmitting the MID to ensure that another node has not simultaneously transmitted a MID with a higher priority.

It is sometimes used as the name of a fifth. Their names are different in Hebrew, but they were all transliterated as \\"Shuah\\" in the King James Version. Genesis 25 Shuah (Hebrew: ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊ó÷∑, pronounced \\"Shuakh\\", \\"ditch; swimming; humiliation\\"Hitchcock's Bible Dictionary: Shuah or \\"sinks down\\"Brown-Driver- Briggs) was the sixth son of Abraham (the patriarch of the Israelites) and Keturah, whom Abraham had wed after the death of Sarah. He was the youngest of Keturah's sons; the others were Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, and Ishbak. Shuah in Greek is Œ£œâœÖŒµ, transliterated Soie.From the Septuagint and Brenton Josephus gave his name as Œ£Œø·ø¶ŒøœÇ (Sous in Whiston).Josephus, Flavius, Antiquities, 1.15.1 Greek Whiston Josephus writes of the brothers that \\"Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis,In this case the word is applied to the cave dwelling peoples of the Rift Valley and the country of Arabia Felix, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea.\\" It is a traditional view among believers in the story that Abraham tried to keep his other sons apart from Isaac to avoid conflict. ; Josephus, Flavius, Antiquities, 1.4.1-3 But unlike his brothers, Shuah seems to have turned northward and travelled into northern Mesopotamia, in what is now the northern region of modern-day Syria. As evidenced by cuneiform texts, the land seems to have been named after him, being known as the land of S√ªchu which lies to the south of ancient Hittite capital of Carchemish on the Euphrates river.Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Review and Herald Publishing Association (Washington, D.C., USA), 1953, p.367 The Bible also records that Job's friend Bildad was a Shuhite.; Genesis 38 Shuah or Shua (Hebrew: ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊¢÷∑, pronounced \\"Shua ø\\", with an ayin glottal stop at the end, \\"opulence\\"Brown-Driver-Briggs or \\"cry for help\\"Strong's Concordance) was a certain Canaanite, whose unnamed daughter marries Judah. He was thereby also the grandfather of Er, Onan, Shelah. The Targum translates \\"Canaanite man\\" as \\"merchant\\", and Rashi refers to this. In the Talmud, Pesachim 50a, there is a discussion explaining this translation. In the King James Version, Genesis 38:2 reads \\"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah ...\\" This is ambiguous as to who is named Shuah, the Canaanite or his daughter.The Hebrew says \\"his name\\", and Genesis 38:12 refers to the death of Shuah's daughter. This has led some to say that Shuah was Judah's wife. Shuah in Greek is Œ£Œ±œÖŒ±, transliterated Sava.From the Septuagint and Brenton . The Septuagint is explicit that Sava is the daughter of the Canaanite man and the wife of Judah. The reference to Judah's wife in Genesis 38:12 refers to her as the \\"daughter of Shuah\\", or \\"bat-Shuah\\" in Hebrew. This has led some to take Bat-Shuah (and variants) as her actual name. A midrashic tradition says her name was Aliyath. Chapter 45:4,29 Bat-Shuah is also an alternative name for Bat-Sheva, wife of Judah's descendant, King David. 1 Chronicles 4 Shuah or Shuhah (Hebrew: ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊ó÷∏◊î, pronounced \\"Shukhah\\") is a descendant of Judah.

Description This species bears a stark resemblance to the prairie warbler, sharing its streaking on the belly, yellow-green back, and subtle yellow wingbars, differing with the intensity of the black streaks. Its song is a string of 4-5 rising harsh buzzy notes. Ecology This species usually occupies dry woodland with considerable scrub, though will tolerate some disturbance, and has begun to occupy more urbanized areas since human arrival.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis In old chronicles, there are descriptions of handsome knights and beautiful ladies. Had these writers known the youth, they would have expressed it in their work. In fact, their descriptions are prophecies that prefigure the beauty of the youth. Though they had prophetic power, they did not have enough poetic skill. Even we, though we can see the perfection of the youth, lack the words to praise it. Structure Sonnet 106 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 4th line famously exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, (106.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The first and second quatrains both open with a rather unassertive initial inversion; the 5th line also exhibits a rightward movement of the third ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): / √ó √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, (106.5) A minor ionic potentially recurs at the same point in the final line. The meter demands line 7's \\"antique\\" be stressed on the first syllable, and line 8's \\"even\\" function as one syllable.

Sexually dimorphic, the male has navy blue upperparts with a bright red streak down its back from its crown to its tail coverts, while the female and juvenile are predominantly olive green. It is found in subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and occasionally gardens in a number of countries throughout South and East Asia. Taxonomy Male at Gosaba, Sundarban, West Bengal, India The scarlet-backed flowerpecker was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, with the binomial name Certhia cruentata, among the treecreepers. It was later reclassified into the flowerpecker genus Dicaeum. The specific epithet cruentatum 'bloodstained' is derived from the Latin verb cr«îentare 'to stain with blood'. Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA of 70% of flowerpecker species showed the scarlet-backed and black-fronted flowerpecker (D. igniferum) - which is endemic to the Indonesian Lesser Sunda Islands - to be each other's closest relative; the males of both species have red plumage on their backs. Description Female scarlet-backed flowerpecker, seen in Bangkapi, Bangkok, Thailand Measuring 9 cm (3.5 in) and weighing , the scarlet-backed flowerpecker is a small bird with a short tail. It exhibits sexual dimorphism. The male has a navy blue face, wings and tail, with a broad bright red stripe from its crown to its upper tail coverts. The female is predominantly olive green with a black tail and scarlet upper tail coverts and rump. Both sexes have creamy white underparts, black eyes and legs, and a dark grey arched bill. The juvenile has plumage similar to the female but has an orange bill and lacks the bright red rump. Distribution and habitat It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. No global population studies have been undertaken; it is thought to be common throughout most of its range particular in Thailand, although it is considered rare in Bhutan and Nepal. It is found up to 1000 m (3500 ft), in subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, wooded areas and gardens. In the north of its range, it is found in southeastern China to Fujian (as the subspecies Dicaeum c. cruentatum). It has been recorded from both native and plantation forest in West Bengal in India. Feeding It has been observed feeding on the figs of Ficus fistulosa and F. grossularoides in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve in Singapore. It visits Syzygium jambos in urban Hong Kong. Breeding The scarlet-backed flowerpecker weaves its pouch-shaped nest hanging from a branch high up in a tree. The nest has a side entrance, typical for those of the flowerpecker family.

Media coverage Initial coverage (March‚ÄìApril 2006) The case attracted widespread media attention almost from the moment it became public. The apparent circumstances‚Äîthree white males (David Evans, Reade Seligmann, and Collin Finnerty) from privileged backgrounds at an elite university apparently taking advantage of a student and single mother (Crystal Gail Mangum) from a crosstown black college (NCCU), trying to make ends meet by working as a stripper and escort‚Äîseemed tailor- made for wall-to-wall coverage. However, once the case deteriorated, critics saw it as a stinging showcase of bias in the media and the university system. Among those giving extensive coverage to the matter was Nancy Grace. Before Duke suspended its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, \\"I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over a little thing like gang rape!\\" and \\"Why would you go to a cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?\\" Another, Susan Estrich, said \\"I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor.\\" Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case with some of the most inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, \\"Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism.\\" Murphy said \\"I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth.\\" Feminist blogger Amanda Marcotte declared on her blog that people who defended the wrongly accused Duke students were \\"rape-loving scum\\". Time reported that in \\"late January, more ethics charges were heaped on the District Attorney in the Duke University sexual-assault case, and Marcotte attacked the news with her usual swagger and sarcasm:\\" Marcotte later deleted posts on her blog critical of her statements, then later deleted the entire entry. Reason contributing editor Cathy Young has described Marcotte as a \\"leader of the cyber-lynch mob in the Duke University rape hoax\\". In \\"Marcotte's eyes, the real crime of the 'independent feminists' is helping preserve the idea that the presumption of innocence applies even in cases of rape and sexual assault.\\" Other outlets that have been accused of taking an initial pro-prosecution slants included, but are not limited to: * USA Today * The Herald-Sun * Rolling Stone * New York Times * News and Observer * Independent Weekly wrote articles affirming the stereotypes of affluence with respect to the three accused. The only position cited was the description of the players' characters by faculty member Peter Wood. The case continues (May‚ÄìOctober 2006) Grace continued to feature developments in the case on her program, with a pro-prosecution slant. On June 9, 2006, after hearing reporting on various defense motions, which the CNN reporter indicated might already prove reasonable doubt, Grace sarcastically asked, \\"Well I'm glad you have already decided the outcome of the case, based on all of the defense filings. Why don't we just all move to Nazi Germany, where we don't have a justice system and a jury of one's peers?\\" On June 22, 2006, she featured Sports Illustrated writer Lester Munson who opined, \\"I think the state has probably a better case than most observers are describing. I have studied this at some length ... There is some voracity to the victim's account.\\" On August 6, 2006, The News & Observer of Raleigh, NC, wrote that District Attorney Mike Nifong \\"promised DNA evidence that has not materialized. He suggested that police conduct lineups in a way that conflicted with department policy.\\"Lacrosse files show gaps in DA's case . The News & Observer. 6 August 2006. The article went on to say that \\"he made a series of factual assertions that contradicted his own files: He suggested the players used condoms; he accused the players of erecting a wall of silence to thwart investigators; and he said the woman had been hit, kicked and strangled. The medical and police records show that the victim had said no condom was used, that police had interviewed three players at length and taken their DNA samples and that the accuser showed no significant bruises or injuries.\\" On August 25, 2006, amid growing doubts as to the strength of the case and the veracity of Mangum, The New York Times published a front page article by Duff Wilson and Jonathan Glater stating that the weaknesses in the case highlighted by the defense were not indicative of the strength of the case as a whole. \\"In several important areas, the full files, reviewed by The New York Times, contain evidence stronger than that highlighted by the defense.\\" The Times story further indicated that \\"there is also a body of evidence to support decision to take the matter to a jury.\\"Wilson, Duff and Glater, Jonathan D. Files from Duke Rape Case Give Details but no Answers The New York Times. 25 August 2006. This article would be widely criticized as the actual lack of strength of Nifong's case became apparent. In spite of widespread criticism, the newspaper's Public Editor defended Wilson, and he was permitted to remain on the case through Nifong's disbarment trial. The case deteriorates (November 2006-May 2007) After many inflammatory comments about the defendants, Nancy Grace's show covered the dismissal of charges on the day of the announcement, but with a substitute host. Undaunted by the lack of DNA evidence, CNN's Paula Zahn insisted that \\"the DA would not be proceeding with this case if he didn't believe that this alleged victim had been raped.\\" She also demanded explanations \\"How, then, sir , do you explain the woman's injuries ... particularly some of the internal injuries?\\" Perhaps the most grudging admission of exoneration came from The Boston Globe, which stated in a lead editorial: \\"Three members of the Duke lacrosse team may have been louts, but all the evidence suggests they were not rapists . . . the students have the resources to get on with their lives.\\"Boston Globe editorial The Boston Globe. 13 April 2007. Similarly grudging was sportswriter John Feinstein, who stated on the syndicated sports talk show The Jim Rome Show in May 2007 \\"I think they're guilty of everything but rape\\" and \\"I really don‚Äôt want to hear that they‚Äôre victims and martyrs, and that their lives have been ruined.\\" Feinstein, who in March 2006 had demanded the revocation of the scholarships of every Duke men's lacrosse team member, and who (against the findings of the Coleman report) continued to describe the team as \\"out-of- control\\", added \\"I don't think I've been proven wrong.\\"KNBR radio interview with John Feinstein KNBR. 4 May 2007. Nancy Grace, who had been particularly vocal in her support for Nifong's prosecution, took the night off for the show following the Attorney General's dismissal of all charges, with Jane Velez- Mitchell guest hosting instead. While the march of the 2007 Duke men's team to the NCAA final game generally received extensive and favorable coverage, a number of sportswriters published negative stories about the team.

Bennett President Scolds Duke Players, The Raleigh Chronicle, April 20, 2007. The Duke Chronicle noted the closing of the case, and stated. \\"There are other members of the Duke community, however, from whom we have not heard [...] These are the voices of the range of individuals, from students to professors to community members, who responded to last year's allegations not with moderation [...] but with extreme, inflammatory and unfounded statements.\\"In Search of Closure , Duke Chronicle. 13 April 2007. Response Duke faculty groups Soon after the allegations were made, 88 Duke professors (referred to sometimes as the \\"Group of 88\\", sometimes referred to as the \\"Gang of 88\\") from the Trinity College of Arts & Sciences placed an ad in The Chronicle referring to the circumstances surrounding the allegations as a \\"social disaster\\" and quoting primarily anonymous individuals citing racism and sexism in the Duke community. The advertisement concluded, \\"We're turning up the volume [...] To the students speaking individually and to the protestors making collective noise, thank you for not waiting and for making yourselves heard,\\" and \\"These are the students shouting and whispering about what happened to this young woman.\\" Notable signatories included Houston Baker, Miriam Cooke, Anne Allison, Cathy Davidson, Ariel Dorfman, Michael Hardt, Alice Kaplan, Claudia Koonz, Pedro Lasch, Walter Mignolo, Mark Anthony Neal and Alex Rosenberg. The ad was spearheaded by faculty member Wahneema Lubiano. In three departments, more than half of faculty signed the statement. The department with the highest proportion of signatories was African and African-American Studies, with 80%. Just over 72% of the Women's Studies faculty signed the statement, Cultural Anthropology 60%, Romance studies 44.8%, Literature 41.7%, English 32.2%, Art & Art History 30.7%, and History 25%. No faculty members from the Pratt School of Engineering or full-time law professors signed the document. Departments that had no faculty members sign the document include Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Genetics, Germanic Languages/Literature, Psychology and Neuroscience, Religion, and Slavic and Eurasian Studies. In January 2007, many months after the initial print of the ad, a new letter was posted at the Concerned Duke Faculty website signed by 87 faculty members stating that the original ad was misinterpreted. The letter states that the intent of the original ad was to address issues of racism and sexism in the community and not to prejudge the case. In January 2007, lacrosse team member Kyle Dowd filed a lawsuit against Duke University and visiting associate professor and signatory to the original ad, Kim Curtis, claiming that he and another teammate were given failing grades on their final paper as a form of retaliation after the scandal broke. The case has been settled with the terms undisclosed except that Dowd's grade was altered to a P. Dowd's mother emailed another original signatory, Houston Baker, who continued after the charges had been dropped to accuse her son and the others of being \\"hooligans, rapists,\\" and called her \\"the mother of a farm animal.\\"Peter Applebome, \\"After Duke Prosecution Began to Collapse, Demonizing Continued\\", The New York Times, April 15, 2007. Another signatory, Thavolia Glymph, said she was disappointed because \\"since the DNA results were returned Monday, we moving backwards.\\" The DNA results indicated that there was neither any sexual nor physical connection between the stripper and the players she accused. Seventeen faculty members of the economics department sent a letter showing support for the players on January 6, 2007, saying, \\"We regret that the Duke faculty is now seen as prejudiced against certain of its own students,\\" and telling the players that they are more than welcome to enroll in their courses.Teacher Support for the Duke Players.

First, they must deflect public attention from their boorish, racist, and illegal behavior by mounting outlandish attacks on the survivor and the D.A. Second, they must deal with a mountain of physical evidence, that is corroborated by, we have reason to believe, accounts of some of the men who were at the party who have cooperated with the police and the D.A. from early on.\\" North Carolina Attorney General Roy A. Cooper refuted these facts in the summary of findings report. It stated that \\"no evidence ... corroborate[d] the accusing witness's versions of the events ... No DNA evidence confirmed her stories ... No medical evidence confirmed her stories ... No other witness confirmed her stories ... The accusing witness‚Äôs accounts of the story changed significantly.\\"Summary of Conclusions . North Carolina Attorney General's Office, 27 April 2007. Accessed on 14 November 2007. In April 2006, civil rights activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss the case. Sharpton began the interview by commending the \\"blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community to stand up for this girl.\\" In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, \\"First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?\\" When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, \\"I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had ‚Äî and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict.\\" Sharpton continued that the case parallels \\"Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom.\\" At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. \\"I don't know yet and I think that the proper thing to do is to support those that want justice.\\" On April 15, 2006, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said that his non-profit Rainbow/Push Coalition organization would pay for the college tuition of the accuser, Mangum, whether she fabricated the story or not.Jesse Jackson Says Organization Will Pay Alleged Rape Victim's Tuition. Wral.com, 15 April 2006. Jackson said that she should never \\"have to stoop that low to survive.\\" He continued that the \\"...fantasy's as old as slave masters impregnating young slave girls [...] The character of this thing is chilling [and] [s]omething happened that everybody's ashamed of...\\" Defense attorney Joe Cheshire found Jackson's comment about \\"slave masters\\" odd because the players did not ask for black strippers. \\"There is no slave-master mentality here, and that's just another perfect example of [...] self-absorbed race pandering,\\" Cheshire stated. After all charges were dropped on April 13, 2007, the North Carolina NAACP praised the state attorney general's investigation into Mangum's claims that had found them to be without merit. Bloggers The case received extensive coverage on blogs. One blog which supported the three students was Durham-in-Wonderland authored by Brooklyn College history professor KC Johnson. Johnson also co-authored a book on the case with journalist Stuart Taylor, entitled Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case. The players' lawyers stated that they used the blog as a resource throughout the case, and Seligmann made a point of thanking Johnson in his statement following the dismissal of charges.Midnight Blogger Exposes a Scandal , National Post 16 April 2007. \\"Wanted poster\\" distribution A poster that \\"looked like a wanted poster\\" was distributed on campus and in nearby neighborhoods shortly after the allegations surfaced in March 2006 showing pictures and names of 40 members of the lacrosse team, urging them to \\"come forward\\" with information on the alleged rape.\\"Rape allegations cast pall at Duke\\", USA Today March 29, 2006 Duke administration and University president During the initial investigation of the players by Durham police, Dean Sue Wasiolek advised the players to cooperate with police and tell the truth, not tell anybody about the charges, nor hire attorneys because she thought nothing would come of it. Wasiolek is one of the defendants named in the Ekstrand lawsuit. Chris Kennedy, senior associate athletic director, told the captains to contact their parents immediately and to hire attorneys shortly after (on March 17). Moneta and Brodhead placed Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty on interim suspension for the Spring 2006 semester following their indictment, while David Evans graduated the day before he was indicted. In the fall of 2006, their status was modified to \\"administrative leave\\" to allow them to make academic progress while not at the university. Richard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University, was quoted by WRAL-TV as saying to the Durham Chamber of Commerce on April 20, 2006, \\"If our students did what is alleged, it is appalling to the worst degree. If they didn‚Äôt do it, whatever they did is bad enough.\\"Lacrosse Publicity 'Unwished' For Duke, Durham, Brodhead Says. WRAL Raleigh Durham Fayetteville TV', April 20, 2006 At the same time, Brodhead repeatedly stated that \\"our students must be presumed innocent until proven otherwise,\\"Criticism directed at Nifong and Duke .

Duke News & Communications. 25 March 2006. On December 20, 2006, Brodhead stated that \\"the DA's case will be on trial just as much as our students will be.\\" Two days later, Nifong dropped the most serious rape charges against the players. Brodhead released a statement calling for Nifong to recuse himself and questioned his actions: \\"Given the certainty with which the district attorney made his many public statements regarding the rape allegation, his decision today to drop that charge must call into question the validity of the remaining charges. The district attorney should now put this case in the hands of an independent party who can restore confidence in the fairness of the process. Further, Mr. Nifong has an obligation to explain to all of us his conduct in this matter.\\"Rape Charges Dropped in Duke Lacrosse Case. Wral.com. 22 December 2006. On January 3, 2007, Brodhead invited Seligmann and Finnerty back to Duke as students in good standing even though they still faced charges.Duke Invites Lacrosse Defendants to Return. WRAL.com. 3 January 2007. They were also welcomed to participate on the lacrosse team. Brodhead explained, \\"We have decided that the right and fair thing to do is to welcome back Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty to resume their studies at Duke for the spring semester. Although the students still face serious charges and larger issues require Duke‚Äôs collective attention, the circumstances in this case have changed substantially, and it is appropriate that the students have an opportunity to continue their education.\\" Both declined. Instead, Seligmann decided to enroll at Brown University, while Finnerty chose to attend Loyola College in Maryland. Brodhead, in an interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, stated that \\"Duke has a rule and many, many, many other universities observe the same rule, which is that when a student is indicted for a crime that has an element of violence, we often separate the student from the university because you don't know at that time what harm [...] might be done either in the community or to the student. It isn‚Äôt a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try to understand the nature of the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to get on with their life. Once the facts took the turn they did in December, then we had to rebalance those things. Then at that point it just seemed to us that simple fairness meant that we had to allow the students to come back.\\" In regards to the team's season, Duke athletic director Joe Alleva decided to forfeit two games due to admitted behaviors such as \\"underage drinking and hiring private party dancers\\".Duke Suspends Men's Lacrosse Games Pending Clearer Resolution of Legal Situation . Duke News & Communications, March 28, 2006. Accessed on 8 July 2007.Lacrosse Responses: A Few Key Points . Duke Alumni Association. Accessed on 2 January 2007. According to Brodhead, the team's players then \\"wished to suspend competitive play until the DNA results come back.\\" Brodhead then decided to suspend the remainder of the season until \\"there [was] a clearer resolution of the legal situation.\\" In an open letter to the public, Brodhead outlined his formation of committees to examine the lacrosse team, the administration's response to the incident, the student judicial process, campus culture, and a presidential council.Letter to the Community from President Brodhead . Duke News & Communication. 5 April 2006. The committees have been criticized by some observers, including KC Johnson, former student president Elliott Wolf (offered a seat in the Campus Culture Initiative), and the Chronicle, since it was chaired by several Group of 88 members such as Anne Allison, Karla FC Halloway, and lacrosse critics Prasad Kasibhatla and Peter Wood. Among the conclusions of the Group-chaired committees was shared governance of athletics by faculty members, and required classes for students by Group members. Also, the student senate representative was Chauncey Nartey, a student who Sue Pressler had previously reported to the police because he had made death threats to Mike Pressler's family. After Nifong's resignation and disbarment, Brodhead released a statement: \\"One fact stares us in the face: The ordeal of the last 15 months was wholly unnecessary. It was not the result of reasonable differences of legal opinion or honest errors of judgment. Our students were accused by the community's senior law enforcement officer with no credible basis in fact [...] The actions Duke took caused consternation to many in the University family, which I profoundly regret. As Duke University's president, I resolve to do my part to repair the harm unleashed by Mr. Nifong's actions and to move forward from this painful episode.\\"Students and administration say Bar made right move . The Chronicle, June 21, 2007. Accessed on 8 July 2007. Later, Brodhead apologized to the lacrosse players and their families for the university's \\"failure to reach out\\" in a \\"time of extraordinary peril.\\" Brodhead's actions generated criticism from opinion pieces in the media. For example, Newsweek published an article on September 10, 2007 that argued that \\"Brodhead and Nifong [the DA in the case] had an almost willful disregard for the facts.\\" An article in The Economist on September 15, 2007, stated that Brodhead did \\"little, if anything, to defend the lacrosse players or to criticise the faculty [at Duke] for its lynching mob mentality.\\" Stuart Taylor Jr. and KC Johnson argue President Brodhead and other administrators \\"portray[ed] them [the students] with grotesque exaggeration as a bunch of uncooperative, rowdy, drunken white racists who might well be rapists, too. Nifong, hoping to divert attention from the powerful proof of innocence in the soon-to-be-public DNA tests (that exculpated the students), could hardly have hoped for a more obliging helper than Richard Brodhead.\\" Other Duke faculty Duke English Professor Houston Baker (now former professor as he was hired as a Distinguished University Professor at Vanderbilt University in May 2006Five prominent African American literature scholars to move to Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt News Service. 25 May 2006.) wrote a scathing letter on March 29, 2006, regarding the lacrosse team and the administration's response to the incident, asking, \\"[w]hat have Duke and its leadership done to address this horrific, racist incident alleged to have occurred\\" and asserting \\"we have been deeply embarrassed by the silence that seems to surround this white, male athletic team's racist assaults (by words, certainly - deeds, possibly) in our community.\\"Provost Responds to Faculty Letter Regarding Lacrosse . Duke News & Communication, 3 April 2006. Contains full text of Baker and Lange letters. Baker also wrote that the players were \\"safe under the cover of silent whiteness\\" and these \\"[y]oung, white, violent, drunken men among us - [are] implicitly boasted [sic] by our athletic directors and administrators.\\" He said Duke has joined other colleges and universities in the \\"blind-eying of male athletes, veritably given license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech, and feel proud of themselves in the bargain.\\" He also explicitly stated that the lacrosse players displayed \\"abhorrent sexual assault, verbal racial violence, and drunken white male privilege loosed amongst us.\\" Duke University Provost Peter Lange responded, \\"I cannot tell you how disappointed, saddened and appalled I was to receive this letter from you. A form of prejudice - one felt so often by minorities whether they be African American, Jewish or other - is the act of prejudgment: to presume that one knows something 'must' have been done by or done to someone because of his or her race, religion or other characteristic.\\" He continued, \\"We do not know much about the worst of what may have happened in the incident that has inflamed our community,\\" and concluded, \\"Sadly, letters like yours do little to advance our common cause.\\" Brodhead appointed Duke Law Professor, James Earl Coleman, Jr., to head the committee to examine the lacrosse team's culture.Report of the Lacrosse ad hoc Review Committee . Duke University News & Communications. 5 April 2006. Dr. Coleman found that the team has exhibited \\"exemplary academic and athletic performance\\" and is \\"[n]either racist or sexist. On the contrary, the coach of the Duke Women's Lacrosse team has expressed her sense of camaraderie that exists between the men's and women's team; members of the men's team, for example, consistently come to the women's games. The current as well as former black members of the team have been extremely positive about the support the team provided them.\\" Also in the report, while it was stated that the rates of alcohol abuse for the lacrosse team were higher than most other Duke athletic teams, \\"their conduct has not been different in character than the conduct of the typical Duke student who abuses alcohol.\\" Since then, Coleman has been one of the most vocal critics of Nifong's handling of the case. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Coleman argued that he pandered to the black community in the middle of the election campaign: \\"I think that he pandered to the community by saying 'I'm gonna go out there and defend your interests in seeing that these hooligans who committed the crime are prosecuted. I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, buy, you know, big-time lawyers and get them off. I'm doing this for you.'\\"Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out. 60 Minutes. 15 October 2006. Furthermore, Coleman stated that Nifong has committed serious prosecutorial misconduct, and if there was a conviction, there \\"would be a basis to have the conviction overturned based on his conduct.\\" Professor Steven Baldwin of the Chemistry Department was another of the few faculty members to make public statements about the case. In two letters to the Duke Chronicle (\\"What About Mike Pressler?\\" in April 2006 and \\"The Administration's Mismanagement of Lacrosse\\" in October 2006), Dr. Baldwin strongly criticized the administration's handling of the case, especially with respect to Coach Mike Pressler.

It consists of five episodes, broadcast on BBC One from 18 to 22 December 2007. It aired on PBS' Masterpiece Classic in the United States on 15 and 22 February 2009, in two ninety-minute installments.All-star cast announced for BBC adaptation of Oliver Twist, BBC (25 July 2007)Hemley, Matthew Drop the Dead Donkey duo creates new BBC1 comedy, The Stage (11 July 2007) In Australia, ABC1 also opted to air this series as a two-part special each Sunday at 8:30 pm from 20 December 2009. Production Filming took place in May 2007, with the scene at the workhouse where Oliver asks \\"Please Sir, I want some more\\" being filmed at The Historic Dockyard in Chatham. Differences The adaptation makes several major alterations to the plot of the source material, which include both alterations of events as well as familial relationships. Rose Maylie is living with Mr Brownlow, and she addresses him as \\"uncle\\", but explains that he is in fact her guardian who took her and her sister, Agnes, in when her mother died. Her sister has been missing for many years, and the search for her has been ongoing. Mr Brownlow is now a part of the overall family tree, since Edward Monks is made his grandchild. As in the book, Monks becomes aware that Oliver is his half- brother, born to the missing Agnes who had a relationship with his father, and seeks to end his life so that there is no competition to his inheritance. As a result, Oliver is ultimately revealed to be Mr Brownlow's grandchild, in addition to being Rose's nephew and Monks' half-brother, as in the novel. Unlike the book, however, Monks is not an unattractive, nervous and cowardly epileptic, but a scheming, manipulative and attractive cad seeking engagement to Rose, who clearly doesn't like him. Nancy is even more of a mother figure to Oliver than in the original novel, the famous musical version or especially, the David Lean film version, in which she does not even express any concern at all for him until after she and Sikes bring him back to Fagin's. In the 2007 version, she is seen constantly looking after him and tending to his needs (she even kisses him tenderly at one point, stopping just short of telling the boy that she loves him). When a gun was pointed at Sikes when he attempts to rob the house, he uses Oliver as a shield from the shots, injuring him. Oliver is taken back to Fagin's lair to recover, rather than being nursed back to health in the countryside by the Maylie family, as in the novel. It is Nancy's informing Rose, and a highly skeptical Mr Brownlow, of Oliver's whereabouts that results in her demise at the hands of Sikes. Her ghost continues to haunt him when he returns to London with Oliver, resulting in him choosing to hang himself in the sewers as a means of escaping the London crowds who chase him. Meanwhile, Monks' murderous motive is discovered by Mr Brownlow and Rose; he is disowned and sent to the West Indies, and Oliver, escaping the clutches of the crazed Sikes, returns to the Brownlow household, and is welcomed. It is the Artful Dodger, rather than Oliver, who visits the condemned Fagin in prison, and goes to his public execution. Sikes's dog finds Dodger and the two disappear into the crowds together. Fagin has genuine concern for Oliver in this version.

Unlike many other species in the genus, this species has marked sexual dimorphism with the male having contrasting upper and lower parts with a distinctive bright orange breast patch. The female is dull coloured.  Description  The fire-breasted flowerpecker is a small flowerpecker with a small and dark bill. The male has glossy blue-black upperparts. The underside is buffy but a bright red breast patch. Starting below it and along the middle is a short black stripe going down till the belly. The female is dark olive above and buff below. The sides are olive and the bill has a pale base. Lithograph by John Gould in the Birds of Asia (1850‚Äì83), volume 6, plate 14. T. C.

Weighing just and measuring under long, it is one of the smallest flowerpeckers. They are usually found at the tops of the trees especially on mistletoes. They have a shrill call given regularly and has been likened to snipping scissors and a staccato tsit. The species was first described by Edward Blyth in 1843 based on a specimen obtained from Nepal by B H Hodgson. The name was based on Hodgson's manuscripts but was published by Blyth. The type specimen claimed to have been deposited at the British Museum is said to be lost, but may exist in the collection of the Asiatic Society museum in Calcutta. It has been said to be \\"the smallest bird of India\\" or \\"perhaps the smallest\\": \\"The fire-breasted flower-pecker (Dicaeum ignipectus) is perhaps the smallest bird in India.\\" p. 76  Distribution  It is found widely distributed along the sub-Himalayan region in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and extends into Southeast Asia into Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines. Its natural habitats are temperate forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. D. i. formosum Several populations have been named as subspecies. The nominate ignipectus found along the Himalayas into Southeast Asia on the mainland. The remaining are insular populations and include formosum of Taiwan, luzoniense of Luzon, bonga of Samar and apo of the Negros and Mindanao. The species itself forms a superspecies complex with Dicaeum monticolum, D. celebicum, D. sanguinolentum and D. hirundinaceum which are sometimes all treated as one species. Hybridization with Dicaeum cruentatum has been suggested. Many island forms show patterns of very restricted ranges or micro-endemism and it has been suggested that these be treated with care for conservation planning. The populations found in the Philippines have males with the underparts similar to D. monticolum while the females have a steel-green gloss on the upperparts unlike the dull green of more northern forms. The Sumatran population beccarii is the most distinct form and differs also from D. sanguinolentum. The males have a steel-green gloss on the upper parts and lack the throat patch while the females have greenish upperparts and lack the red rump. Throughout its range, the species is found in high mountains above 1000 metres but in China, they may be found during winter at lower altitudes.  Behaviour and ecology  Like many other flowerpeckers, they disperse the seeds of mistletoes. In the Nepal Himalayas, they have been found to be important dispersers of Scurrula species. In Nainital they are said to breed in June and July. The nest is pendant and purse like, opening on the side towards the top. The nest is thin and felt-like, made up of the hairy coverings of stems from mistletoes. The nest is lined with moss and soft grass. Two or three eggs are laid and both sexes incubate and take care of the young. In Hong Kong, their population is believed to have increased with maturation of restored forest. They were first recorded in 1954 but have starter breed regularly since 1975. References  Other sources  * Lin, Chen-Wei (2006). Studying breeding bird densities in Meifeng Area by Territory mapping.

Early life  Spence was born on 28 April 1699, at Kingsclere, Hampshire, the son of Joseph (Rector of Winnal in Winchester and Precentor of Winchester Cathedral) and Mirabella (n√©e Collier, granddaughter of Sir Thomas Lunsford). In 1709, Spence attended school in Mortimer, near his birthplace, and later attended Eton College and then Winchester College. Spence matriculated to Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 11 April 1717, but did not go up until admitted as scholar or probationary fellow at New College on 22 April 1720. On 30 April 1722, he received a full fellowship, taking his Bachelor of Arts degree on 9 March 1724 and Master of Arts on 2 November 1727. Spence was ordained in the Oxford diocese on 5 June 1726. Early literary friends of Spence included fellow Wykehamists Robert Lowth, Christopher Pitt, and Edward Young. Spence wrote an essay on Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's Odyssey in 1726 which gave rise to a friendship between Spence and Pope. In 1727 Pope published his comments on the second part of Spence's essay.  Later life  Spence was elected as the Oxford Professor of Poetry on 11 July 1728, holding the post for maximum term allowed (ten years). In the same month he was given the New College living of Birchanger, Essex, but continued to live in Oxford when not travelling abroad. Recommended by Alexander Pope, Spence became a travelling companion of Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset and 1st Earl of Middlesex, on a Grand Tour lasting from December 1730 to July 1733. In 1731, while Spence was abroad, his Account of Stephen Duck was published. On his return to Oxford he lectured and made mundane contributions to poetry collections marking royal weddings, births, and deaths. In 1736 he published An Account of Lord Buckhurst and an edition of Gorboduc. Spence was a companion to John Morley Trevor in his tour of the Netherlands, Flanders, and France between May 1737 and February 1738, and between September 1739 and November 1741 travelled in Italy with Henry Pelham-Clinton, the Earl of Lincoln. Lord Lincoln then provided the scholar with appointments and incomes that ensured his financial security. While touring, Spence frequently wrote letters to his mother, which he later edited for publication but never published. On 4 June 1742 Spence was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History and exchanged Birchanger for Great Horwood, Buckinghamshire, which he visited each year and distributed charity. Around 1742 he gave up his fellowship at New College and settled with his mother in London and often visited Alexander Pope. After much work, Spence published Polymetis as an illustrated folio in February 1747. He had first thought of such a work during his first visit to Italy and used much of the material he had collected there, intending to demonstrate the relationship between the works of ancient artists and of Roman poets. The work was criticsed by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in his 1766 work, ', which subsequently adversely affected its standing. In 1748, Lord Lincoln gave Spence the use of a house he owned at Byfleet, Surrey, which Spence and his mother moved into. Having designed Birchanger's garden along the lines of Pope's garden in Twickenham, and planting extensively at Great Horwood, as well as designing gardens and making notes for friends London, Spence further explored his interest in landscape gardening at Byfleet ‚Äì developing the estate as a ferme orn√©e. Though making extensive notes and translating Jean Denis Attiret's account of the Emperor of China's gardens, Spence left his gardening treatise, Tempe, unfinished. His translation of Attiret was published in 1752 under the pen name of \\"Sir Harry Beaumont\\", which he also used for Crito, published in 1752, and Moralities, published in 1753. In 1752-3 Spence published accounts of Robert Hill (tailor) and Thomas Blacklock, and promoted a subscription edition of Blacklock's poems. In 1758, Spence travelled with Robert Dodsley to visit Blacklock in Scotland, and en route, visited William Shenstone at The Leasowes. Spence had his work Parallel in the Manner of Plutarch printed at Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Press in 1758, to raise money for Hill. In 1753 Spence provided notes for an edition of Virgil written by Joseph Warton, and in 1768 edited the Remarks on Virgil by Edward Holdsworth, the authors being friends and Old Wykehamists. Spence was installed as a prebendary of Durham Cathedral on 24 May 1754, a posting on the generosity of the Bishop of Durham, Richard Trevor. Spence continued to live at Byfleet and spent more than the minimum time required for his prebendal duties of three weeks' residence at Durham. In Durham, he not only began to improve the garden of his prebendal estate, but also those of his neighbours, the bishop and the Earl of Darlington, Henry Vane, sometimes spending weeks at a time travelling to landscaped gardens where his advice had been sought. Spence suffered a mild stroke during his annual journey north in June 1766, and made his will at Sedgefield, Durham, on 4 August 1766. On 24 March 1767, Spence sold the copyrights, including those on his unpublished works, to James Dodsley for ¬£100. His executors, however, blocked publication of the Anecdotes. On 20 August 1768 Spence was found lying face down in the shallow ornamental waters of his garden at Byfleet and was buried four days later at St Mary's, Byfleet.  Works  Spence's published works include An Essay on Pope's Odyssey (1726) and Polymetis (1747). Spence's unpublished works include his edition of travelling letters, notes for a gardening treatise, notes for a biographical history of English poetry, and his anecdotes, which include tales about Alexander Pope and other literary figures such as John Arbuthnot, Isaac Newton, and Stephen Duck.

Plot Jude Madigan (Curtis) suddenly and inexplicably leaves her husband, Robert (Gallagher), and three sons. Three years later, when Robert finally files for divorce, Jude returns and tries to reclaim her former life. Robert refuses and insists on the divorce. Jude does not accept Robert's decision. She tries, unsuccessfully, to seduce him and harasses Robert's new girlfriend, Callie (Whalley). Eventually, Jude manipulates and convinces her eldest son, Kes (Luke Edwards), that Callie is the only person standing in the way of their reunited family. Influenced by Jude, Kes details a plan to his two brothers, Michael and Ben (Colin Ward and Joey Zimmerman), to scare off Callie, convincing them that it is just a game. As the boys debate the plan, Jude's estranged mother, Lydia (Redgrave), overhears and confronts Kes and threatens to tell their father. Kes tries unsuccessfully to convince his grandmother that it was just a \\"game\\" and tries to stop her from calling his father. A brief struggle ensues and Lydia accidentally falls down the stairs. While in the hospital, Lydia tells Jude she is not about to let her go through with her plans. She also tells Jude that her father \\"committed a great sin\\" against Jude, suggesting that Jude's father might have been molesting her from a young age (which might explain Jude's current erratic and sociopathic behavior). Lydia then goes on to say that she had planned on taking Jude away from her father (Viewers are led to believe that this is the reason behind Jude's father's suicide). In a fit of rage, Jude then tries to murder her mother by asphyxiation but is interrupted by a nurse, Jude then flees the hospital. In a state of grief, Jude vandalizes her apartment by smashing the windows, furniture, and fixtures. Meanwhile, the boys, under the guise of playing the game, handcuff Callie and put her on \\"trial\\" for destroying their family. They tie her to a chair but when Ben cuts himself on a broken glass, Callie convinces Michael to free her before his brother dies. She runs with him in an attempt to find a hospital. Kes and Michael get in Callie's car and chase them, but the brakes have been cut by Jude and they go over a cliff, leaving them perched precariously on a tree on the side of the cliff. Callie manages to rescue Michael, but as she tries to rescue Kes, she slips and is left dangling from the car. Jude rushes to \\"help\\" by grabbing Callie's hand from Kes. Jude intentionally lets go of Callie's hand, who still manages to hang onto the car with her other hand. However, Jude loses her balance and falls to her death. The film ends with Robert's emotional embrace of Kes, who is very shaken after having a nightmare of Jude coming back from the dead. Callie is right by Robert's side, comforting them both.

Habitat  Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical mangrove forest, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.  Description  Male is distinctive, and shows slaty-blue upperparts (crown/nape/wings/tail) except for a large triangular orange patch on the mantle. It has a fairly thin and short bill that is slightly curved downwards at the tip. Upper-breast and throat are a lighter greyish blue; from the lower breast to the vent is a gradient from fiery orange (on the lower breast) to yellow (on the vent). Female is much duller, and is mostly drab olive brown overall, except for its pale orange rump and yellow belly. Dicaeum trigonostigma melanostigma Delacour (Birds of Malaysia, 1947) cited a name Dicaeum trigonostigma melanostigma, but because no description accompanied this name, and no type was identified, it was published as a nomen nudum. He later (in litt.) asserted that the name was a lapsus (Salomonsen, American Mus. Novitates No. 1991 (1960)). However, melanostigma continued to be cited in various lists (Howard and Moore, Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1980, 1991)), as well as on websites which list birds common to Thailand and the surrounding region, thus possibly allowing for the inadvertent description of this name should any published reference to it accompany a picture of an orange-bellied flowerpecker. Dickinson (Complete Howard and Moore Checklist (2003)) also asserted that the name was a lapsus, but of Howard and Moore's, with no reference to Delacour.

They established missions at Port Douglas and Skookumchuck Hot Springs, and encouraged the native people of the area to settle together in small villages. Earlier churches are no longer standing. There has never been a resident priest assigned to the villages in the area; priests travelled through on their way north from St. Mary's Indian Residential School in Mission, or came down from Mount Currie. Usually they came only once a year, and there are many examples of five or six couples all being married or a number of babies being baptised on the same day, when the annual visit of the priest took place. The services often took place outdoors, or in the home of a community leader. There had been at least 2 other places of worship in Skatin before they embarked on the present building. Some of the families travelled outside for seasonal work, and had seen the large churches in Sechelt, British Columbia, and New Westminster. They were also inspired by the prayer cards with pictures of European cathedrals, and chose to create a place of worship that is also a work of art. Although some men may have worked building other churches, they were not trained carpenters, and used the tools available to them at the time. Local aboriginal craftsmen laboured for years on the elaborately carved altar and finely worked wood details of this remarkable building, which was completed about 1905. Materials from the local area were used, huge trees from the forests; some of the milling may have been done at Port Douglas or even as far away as Harrison Mills at the south end of Harrison Lake. Materials were transported by horse-drawn wagons, rafts and canoes, or carried on their backs. Many generations have been baptized, married and buried from the Church which continues today as a place of worship and ceremony for people in the surrounding communities of Samahquam, Douglas First Nation and Mount Currie. The Church was blessed by the Catholic Archbishop in 1908, but the building belongs to the people of the communities who built it. Some restoration work was carried out in 1982 to 1984, and the church was blessed by Archbishop Carney. At that time, elders Henry Peters and Margaret Ann Peters (Williams) celebrated their 51st wedding anniversary, and baptized a great-grand daughter, Jessica. National Historic Site The Church was designated by the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board in 1981 because of its unique Carpenter Gothic architecture and hand-carved interior features. The church builders were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected on June 22, 2006. The tri-lingual plaque is in Ucwalmicwts, English and French. \\"Amha Lakwa Lamcalalhcw\\" Conservation In the winter of 2006, conservation work started, stabilizing the interior of the towers and steeples. The following year, work on the foundations was started; completed in 2008, the Church is now supported by in-ground concrete footings, which replace the old river rock. In some places where the original wood beams supporting the church were rotted, the ends of the beams were trimmed, and new wood inserted. When the front porch was removed, the long support beam under the front of the Church was found to be full of dry rot - easily 4 to 5 inches of the 16 inch timber had been destroyed. In order to complete the work before winter, a concrete bearing wall was installed under the front of the church. The two towers on the east and west are also now supported by concrete foundations. The building is now on a stable foundation, but deterioration of the envelope, towers, and decorative trims continue. The work on the foundations was taped by PTV Productions, and a one-hour documentary \\"Saving Places\\" will be broadcast on History TV.you can enquire from them about broadcast date, or contact [Ama Liisaos Heritage Trust Society] In August 2009, the Society received notice from Parks Canada that the Canadian government is prepared to enter into a cost-sharing agreement, with funds of up to $202,060 for 'eligible' expenses. The volunteers will still have to raise matching funds for the work to proceed. An official Ministerial announcement by MP Randy Kamp was celebrated on November 14, 2009. Since then, there has been an Emergency Intervention at the Church; damaged windows, trim, and woodwork have been removed from the two towers and stored safely. Exposed holes have been covered with plywood an tyvar to keep out the weather. Over the winter, a team of architects, engineer and consultants will be completed a detailed analysis and plans for conservation work. Conservation will include repair and replacement of decorative trim and exterior cladding, repair of windows, frames, mullions and trim, scraping and repainting the exterior, replacement of the roof which is nearing 30 years old, upgrading the electrical system, and other safety and fire suppression measures. The Ama Liisaos Heritage Trust Society is raising funds for the conservation of the building; total budget is expected to exceed $450,000 with about half of that coming from the federal cost-sharing agreement. An \\"Adopt a Window\\" campaign has been started, giving families and supporters the opportunity to honour a family member or special event on a memorial plaque. Anyone interested in supporting conservation of this special site should contact Ama Liisaos Heritage Trust Society. A book Spirit in the Land: Our Place of Prayer tells the story of the Church and its builders. A local elder explains that the people did not build this church because they were devout Catholics. \\"They were devoutly spiritual people. Originally, they would have prayed on the land, wherever they were. It was the priests who taught the people to pray in a church. This building has become a centre for our culture and our communities. Our ancestors built this church by working together. It can bring our people back together once again.\\" References External links * Church of the Holy Cross new website * Society President Yvonne Peters website * Story from BC Catholic magazine * Skookumchuck Village in Vanishing BC website, painter/author Michael Kluckner * Skookumchuck Church photos * The Church of the Holy Cross episode of Saving Places Category:Roman Catholic churches in British Columbia Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in British Columbia Category:St'at'imc Category:Lillooet Country Category:National Historic Sites in British Columbia Category:Roman Catholic churches on the National Historic Sites of Canada register ","title":"Church of the Holy Cross (Skatin)"},{"id":"12449400","text":"The scarlet-headed flowerpecker (Dicaeum trochileum) is a species of bird in the family Dicaeidae.

It is native to moist tropical forests of southeastern Asia where its range extends from India to the Philippines and Indonesia. It is a completely black bird with a shallowly forked tail and is similar in appearance to the black drongo. It breeds between April and June, the cup- shaped nest being built in the fork of a branch by both birds, the female afterwards incubating the eggs. It is a common bird and the IUCN has listed it as \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy The crow-billed drongo was originally described by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836 and given the binomial name Bhuchanga annectans. The specific epithet is a misspelling of the Latin word annectens meaning \\"connecting\\". This error has been corrected following the rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to give the current scientific name Dicrurus annectens. The present genus Dicrurus had been introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Description This bird, which is similar to the black drongo, is jet-black in color and has a stout bill. It has a forked tail. Distribution and Habitat It is found in: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. Behavior This species inhabits dense evergreen forests and moist-deciduous forests. The nesting season is from April to June. The nest is usually a small cup made of grass that is held together by cobwebs. The nests can be found in the fork of a slender branch. The female incubates the eggs. However, both the male and female birds build the nest. Diet and Feeding This species eats insects and other small animals.

The species has harsh grating and chattering calls and will also mimic other birds. It breeds in north-east China, Korea, Japan and far-eastern Russia (Ussuriland, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands). Northern birds migrate south for the winter with a few reaching southern China. Vagrants have been recorded in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam. The isolated race sicarius is found only in the mountains of Gansu Province in west-central China. Open habitats such as farmland and woodland edges are preferred. It also visits parks and gardens in urban areas. It sits on a prominent perch, waiting for prey to pass by. It feeds mainly on insects such as beetles and crickets but also preys on lizards and crustaceans. With some other species from the Lanius genus, like the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), the bull-headed shrike is known to impale some of its preys upon a sharp point ‚Äì usually thorns ‚Äì so the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces more easily. It may also do this to cache food and to mark a territory boundary.Bull-headed shrike September 16, 2006 bird- research.jp Retrieved December 17, 2016 The nest is built among bushes or bamboo. Two to six eggs are laid. They are incubated for 14 to 15 days and the young birds fledge 14 days after hatching. References *Brazil, Mark A. (1991) The Birds of Japan.

Part of the final communiqu√© issued at the end of the fifteenth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the Declaration was an endorsement of the report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership (IGCCM). It was issued on 27 October 1997, in Edinburgh, Scotland. The report of the IGCCM consolidated all the membership criteria of the organisation, developed over two-thirds of a century, since the Statute of Westminster 1931, into a single document, beginning the process of codification. Primarily, it was decided that the admission of Mozambique, in 1995, was a unique occurrence, in recognition of Mozambique's support for the Commonwealth's policies towards South Africa and Rhodesia during the Apartheid era; any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member. In addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single document. These requirements, which remain the same today, are that members must: * accept and comply with the Harare principles. * be fully sovereign states. * recognise the Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth. * accept the English language as the means of Commonwealth communication. * respect the wishes of the general population vis-√†-vis Commonwealth membership. On the advice of Secretary-General Don McKinnon, the 2005 CHOGM, held in Valletta, Malta, decided to re-examine the Edinburgh criteria. The Committee on Commonwealth Membership was made responsible, and reported their findings at the 2007 CHOGM, held in Kampala, Uganda. The committee's recommendations were endorsed by the Heads of Government as reported in the final CHOGM communiqu√© of 2007 (the Kampala Communiqu√©), numbered paragraphs 87 through 89. The new rules re-affirm the centrality of the principles set forth in the Singapore Declaration and subsequent declarations (such as the Harare Declaration), but give additional concrete details on the specific requirements for membership. For example, for an applicant to demonstrably comply with the principle of democracy includes the holding of free and fair elections for legislative representatives, and furthermore good governance must include well-trained public servants and transparent public accounts. Most of the other membership requirements were similar to those stated in past declarations, except the very first requirement, a \\"constitutional association\\" with existing members‚Äîthis was substantially weakened by the committee (by adding the clause \\"or a substantial relationship with the Commonwealth or a particular group of its members\\") and was further weakened in the executive CHOGM summary (which instead added an even more general clause \\"save in exceptional circumstances... should be considered on a case-by-case basis\\").

The profiles also included cartoon caricatures by Terry Roth. Roth's detailed obituaries were composed for international and national figures of note, using the skills and information he had collected in his biographical research. A catalogue of his published obituaries in the archives of The Guardian provides a historical perspective to contemporary news as the deaths of the noteworthy are documented and he reviews their lives. Background Roth was born to Hungarian parents in New York City and attended City College and Columbia, Michigan and Harvard universities, where he studied Far Eastern History. Career Amerasia case During 1940, Roth was a researcher at the Institute of Pacific Relations. During World War II, Roth served as a lieutenant with the US Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). The Navy sent him to Harvard University to study Japanese. Upon learning of his membership in the Communist Party USA, the Navy promoted him to liaison with the United States Department of State due to a shortage of Japanese linguists. In June 1945, Roth and five others were arrested during an FBI investigation into the leaking of documents to the journal Amerasia. He was subsequently cleared.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Paraphrase Is there anything new I can say to express my love for you? No, sweet boy, there is nothing, but I must say the same things over again, like prayers to God, in order to keep eternal love fresh. The agedness of love disappears as it looks back to when it was first created, even though the passage of time would suggest it should by now have died. Structure Sonnet 108 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 14th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Where time and outward form would show it dead. (108.14) The sonnet exhibits many metrical variations. There are initial reversals in lines 1, 5, 7, 8, and 13; as well as potential initial reversals in lines 9 and 10. For example: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Finding the first conceit of love there bred, (108.13) Lines 2 and 4 have final extrametrical syllables or feminine endings. Line 2 is particularly complex.

It is found in humid montane forest and scrub in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Flowerpiercers got their name from the fact that they have a sharp hook on the tip of their upper mandible which they use to slice open the base of flowers to get at the nectar. Description The masked flowerpiercer grows to a length of about . The adult male is deep ultramarine blue with a dark mask. The beak is large, black, and upturned, with a characteristic hook on the tip of the upper mandible. The iris is bright red. The female is similar in appearance but altogether duller. The juvenile has a reddish-brown iris. At the northern end of its range, the song is a series of reedlike notes terminating in a twitter, while at the southern end, it is a jangling series of high-pitched notes ending with several lengthy \\"tseee\\" notes. These differing songs suggest that the northerly and southerly populations may be different species. Distribution and habitat The masked flowerpiercer is endemic to the Andes in South America where its range extends from Venezuela and Colombia, through Ecuador and Peru to Bolivia. It inhabits montane forest, cloud forest, secondary forest, scrubby woodland and forest edges, at altitudes between about . Ecology This bird is often seen in small groups or mixed flocks, foraging through the foliage for insects and fruit, and probing into flowers with its beak. The flowers of the small tree Axinaea sclerophylla are pollinated by birds, the pollen being liberated in a puff when the stamens are manipulated. During a research study, the only bird seen visiting the flowers was the masked flowerpiercer, which proceeded to pull off and consume the stamens, one at a time. Breeding takes place between June and September in Colombia, but in other parts of the range, juveniles have been seen at various times of year. The nest is a cup-shaped construction, built in a bush, and composed of mosses and dry grasses and lined with feathers. The eggs are pale bluish-green blotched and speckled with reddish-brown. Status The masked flowerpiercer is described as being common within its very wide range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\" due to its stable population and lack of threats.

Club career Havili began his rugby career in his home country of Tonga, before eventually moving to Wales to play for Bridgend. Upon the advent of regional rugby in Wales in 2003, he joined the Celtic Warriors, whom he played for until they were disbanded in 2004. He was picked up by the Llanelli Scarlets soon afterwards and became the top try scorer in his first season in West Wales However, in 2005, Worcester showed an interest in Havili and he was released from his contract after just one year with the Scarlets so that he could sign for the West Midlands club. Havili's first season at Worcester went well, scoring a total of ten tries in just 16 appearances. After not making a single appearance in the 2007-08 season, it was announced in May 2008 that Havili would be leaving Worcester Warriors to sign for National Division One side Cornish Pirates. Havili provided Cornish Pirates with an alternative style of winger. His physical presence set him apart from most backs within the squad. Perhaps his most noticeable performance came against Plymouth Albion the league in December 2009 where he his try help complete a 46-7 win. At the end of the 09/10 season Havili left the Cornish Pirates before returning to Tonga. International career Havili has had an erratic international career, having earned only nine caps for the Tonga national team. He was selected for the Tonga 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, but pulled out after being told that he would have to pay his own way to Australia to join up with the rest of the squad.

It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The poet denies that he has been emotionally unfaithful even though he has been absent. He can no more be untrue to the youth than to himself. If he has wandered away, he has returned, and washed away his own guilt. Even though the poet is capable of shameful behavior, he could never be so corrupted that he would lose the perfection of the youth. Sonnet 109 explores the uncertainty of a fulfillment of a promise made by the poet to his apparent love. The poet's promised love is inextricable from the fact that the poet is lamenting over a long lost lover who, moreover, has not seen him for quite some time. In the sonnet a sense of forced separation is felt in each quatrain, along with an inconsolable tone which Shakespeare uses to convey an anachronism of revisiting a time of ephemeral love. The poet ends the sonnet with a magnanimous confession of love which is most likely unrequited. Structure Sonnet 109 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 12th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; (109.12) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Line 9 has an initial reversal, a common metrical variant: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Never believe though in my nature reigned, (109.9) There is also an initial reversal in line 5, and potentially in lines 7 and 8. Line 13 may be scanned with a rightward movement of the second ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / √ó / For nothing this wide universe I call, (109.13) The meter demands that line 11's \\"preposterously\\" be pronounced with four syllables (prepost'rously). Context Sonnet 109 was originally published in 1609 with the rest of Shakespeare's sonnets as a collection dedicated to \\"Mr. W.H.\\" and now referred to as the 1609 Quarto or Quarto 1. Sonnet 109 belongs to the group of sonnets (1-126) that are commonly categorized as \\"sonnets to a fair youth.\\" This group of sonnets, according to Arthur F. Marotti, \\"consists of poems written to a younger man who is clearly treated as a patron\\".Mcintosh, Hugh. \\"The Social Masochism of Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì190050.1 (2009): 109-25. Web. The identity of this young patron, who is likely the \\"Mr. W.H.\\" to whom Shakespeare dedicated the sonnets, is considered by many historians and Shakespearean analysts to be Henry Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton. Martin Green supports this hypothesis with the evidence that Shakespeare never wrote dedications in of his works to any person besides Wriothesley.Green, Martin. \\"The Pronunciation of Wriothesley.\\" English Studies 86.2 (2005): 133-60. Web. Shakespeare's relationship with this young man as interpreted from this group of sonnets is not entirely clear; his words of love and affection could be a bid for more favor, or as Judith Kegan Gardiner maintains, a true love that surprised and startled Shakespeare.Gardiner, Judith Kegan, and Dorothy Kegan Gardiner. \\"The Marriage of Male Minds in Shakespeare's Sonnets.\\" The Journal of English and Germanic Philology 84.3 (1985): n. pag. JSTOR. University of Illinois Press. Web. Even if Shakespeare's sonnets are accepted as an expression of genuine love, there is still no consensus in academia whether this love was sexual in nature. Many critics argue that Shakespeare was homosexual, while others maintain that he was heterosexual, including the noteworthy Shakespeare analyst A. L. Rowse, who has claimed \\"Shakespeare is the bawdiest of the Elizabethan dramatists, with the natural bawdy of the highly sexed normal heterosexual\\".Rowse, A. L. \\"Shakespeare the Man.\\" London: Macmillan, 1973. 46. Print. Analysis Like most other Shakespearean Sonnets, 109 consists of three quatrains and a couplet at the end. The volta can be found at the first line of the couplet. Although Sonnet 109 does not make any specific mention of gender, Paul Edmondson, in his book Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets, states that it may be safe to assume that Shakespeare is writing here to a young man. \\"The first 126 [sonnets] include none that are clearly addressed to, or concern, a woman, along with all the ones that are clearly addressed to, or primarily concern, a male\\".Edmondson, Paul, and Stanley Wells. Shakespeare's Sonnets. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004. Print. And so, if this poem is addressed to a male, who is he? According to Martin Green, the young man to whom Shakespeare dedicates many of his sonnets may be Henry Wriothesley, the third earl of Southampton.Green, Martin. \\"The Pronunciation of Wriothesley.\\" English Studies 86.2 (2005): 133-60. Web. If that is the case, then Sonnet 109 does contain some imagery that might refer to Wriothesley. Quatrain 1 (lines 1-4) In Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence, Robert Witt asserts that in Sonnet 109 Shakespeare comes to the realization of his lover's \\"Inner Beauty\\" and how it is a reflection of himself.Witt, Robert W. Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence. Salzburg: Inst. F. Anglistik U. Amerikanistik, 1979. Print. The poet [Shakespeare]‚Ä¶will remain young as long as the friend [lover] is young because the two are one\\".Witt, Robert W. Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence. Salzburg: Inst. F. Anglistik U. Amerikanistik, 1979. Print. This, Witt believes, is what prompted Shakespeare to write Sonnet 109 as a sort of apology for renouncing the friendship between him and his lover after his lover \\"granted favor to other poets\\".Witt, Robert W. Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence. Salzburg: Inst. F. Anglistik U. Amerikanistik, 1979. Print. In lines 1 and 2, Shakespeare explains that even though he was angry at his lover for favoring other poets, he was never unfaithful.Witt, Robert W. Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence. Salzburg: Inst. F. Anglistik U. Amerikanistik, 1979. Print. Furthermore, in lines 3 and 4, Shakespeare continues use of the idea that his lover is a reflection of himself by saying \\"As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie\\".Witt, Robert W. Of Comfort and Despair: Shakespeare's Sonnet Sequence. Salzburg: Inst. F. Anglistik U. Amerikanistik, 1979. Print. Quatrain 2 (lines 5-8) When Shakespeare's sonnets on the theme of poetry as perpetuation lead to arguments that support the complex and metaphysical aspects of love, there is a conviction that Shakespeare is wrestling with the notion of time and love fighting one another. Love and time are always changing, dimming, growing, and suffering together, but in the end Shakespeare allows readers to feel that love itself is the \\"defier of time\\".Leishman, J. B. Themes and Variations in Shakespeare's Sonnets. London: Hutchinson, 1961. Print. In the second quatrain Shakespeare resembles his fondness to that of a traveler returning home punctually. Yet while suggesting his travels have been long, he arrives nonetheless back, unchanged by the flow of time. His love resisting all effects of time perpetuates the meaningfulness of his endearment. His internal and genuine love proceeds from the beauty he views in his passion for himself and for his lover.Leishman, J. B. Themes and Variations in Shakespeare's Sonnets. London: Hutchinson, 1961. Print. It is separable and inseparable, with time and timeless. It is worthwhile to devote some attention to the immutable passion of love in a world of change and short-lived mortality that Shakespeare elaborates on. While the reader searches for the answer of whose love Shakespeare pines for, the question will remain timeless just as this poem and his message. Volta and Couplet Here Shakespeare lays all of his cards out onto the table with the volta, or shift of mood. The use of the word \\"rose\\" in the second line of the couplet is especially notable. Martin Green believes this a significant word because Shakespeare may be using it as a homonym of the last name \\"Wriothesley\\" (the earl of Southampton). \\"The prominence in the Sonnets of Rose imagery associated with and symbolic of the \\"faire friend\\" has given rise to the suggestion that the Rose imagery alludes to Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton‚Ä¶ whose name might have been pronounced Rosely\\".Green, Martin. \\"The Pronunciation of Henry Wriothesley.\\" English Studies 86.2 (2005): 133-60. Web. It is also of significance to note that every time the word \\"rose\\" appears in the 1609 edition of Shakespeare's sonnets it is capitalized, indicating that it may be a proper noun.Green, Martin. \\"The Pronunciation of Henry Wriothesley.\\" English Studies 86.2 (2005): 133-60. Web. Another interpretation of the use of the word rose here comes from Northrop Frye: \\"Rose in Elizabethan parlance meant a 'peerless or matchless person; a paragon'\\".Frye, Northrop, Troni Y. Grande, and Garry Herald Sherbert. Northrop Frye's Writings on Shakespeare and the Renaissance. Toronto [Ont.]: U of Toronto, 2010. The Collected Works of Northrop Frye. Web. 24 Nov. 2014.

It is often placed in the genus Dioptrornis. It is native to Africa, where it occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Description The Abyssinian slaty flycatcher is a rather dingy, nondescript grey brown bird which normally perches with the typical vertical posture of an Old World flycatcher. It has a yellow eye set in a plain brownish face, the upperparts are dark sooty brown and the underparts are buff brown. It measures 15‚Äì16 cm in length and weights 20‚Äì25g. Voice It makes various \\"tseep\\" calls and has a harsh chiiering alarm call. Distribution and subspecies There are two currently recognised subspecies of Abyssinian slaty flycatcher and they are listed below with their distributions: *Melaenornis chocolatinus chocolatinus (R√ºppell, 1840): central Eritrea and north and central Ethiopia. *Melaenornis chocolatinus reichenowi (Neumann, 1902): western Ethiopia. Habitat The Abyssinian slaty flycatcher occurs in mid to high altitude forest, woodland edges, clearings, in agricultural land and in suburbs, where it can be found in large gardens and parks. Habits Hunts in a typical flycatcher manner, sallying from a perch to catch insects in flight. It is suspected to breed in January to February and March to June in Ethiopia with enlarged gonads recorded from specimens taken in June, December and March to May. The nest is cup shaped and is placed at a narrow fork of a horizontal tree branch, the clutch consists of 3 blue-grey, blotched eggs. Taxonomy The Abyssinian slaty flycatcher forms a superspecies with the Angola slaty flycatcher and the white-eyed slaty flycatcher, and these three species are sometime placed in the genus Dioptrornis, or lumped as a single species but the allapatry and morphological differences shown support their treatment as allospecies. The results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 led to a reorganization of the Old World flycatchers family in which the four species in Bradornis and the single species in Sigelus together with the Dioprornis species were merged into Melaenornis.

It examines the debate between Robert Boyle and Thomas Hobbes over Boyle's air-pump experiments in the 1660s. In 2005, Shapin and Schaffer were awarded the Erasmus Prize for this work. On a theoretical level, the book explores the acceptable methods of knowledge production, and societal factors related to the different knowledge systems promoted by Boyle and Hobbes. The \\"Leviathan\\" in the title is Hobbes's book on the structure of society, Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil and the \\"Air-Pump\\" is Robert Boyle's mechanical instrument. The book also contains a translation by Schaffer of Hobbes's Dialogus physicus de natura aeris. It attacked Boyle and others who founded the society for experimental research, soon known as the Royal Society.  Intention of the work  Shapin and Schaffer state in their first chapter, \\"Understanding Experiment\\", that they wish to answer the question, \\"Why does one do experiments in order to arrive at scientific truth?\\"Shapin & Schaffer 1985, p. 3 Their aim is to use a historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his experimental method, to discover the origins of the credibility that we give experimentally produced facts today. The authors wish to avoid \\"'The self-evident'\\"Shapin & Schaffer 1985, p. 4 method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of empiricism). They wish to take a \\"stranger's\\" viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic communityShapin & Schaffer 1985, p. 8 and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's natural philosophy would not have been obvious to contemporaries. They explain that, traditionally, Hobbes's position on natural philosophy has been dismissed by historians because historians perceived Hobbes as \\"misunderstanding\\"Shapin & Schaffer 1985, p. 12 Boyle's work. Thus, in Leviathan and the Air-Pump, Shapin and Schaffer aim to avoid bias and consider both sides' arguments with equal weight. In addition, they comment on the social instability of Restoration society post-1660. They aim to show that the debate between these two contemporaries had political fallout beyond the intellectual sphere, and that accepting Hobbes or Boyle's method of knowledge production was also to accept a social philosophy.Shapin & Schaffer 1985, p. 14  Reception of Leviathan and the Air-Pump  The work has been described as a classic example in the history of science of the posing of a basic question on scientific rationality. Can the rationality of two sides in a debate be described, from outside, when hindsight operates and the \\"road not taken\\" by science is known? Margaret C. Jacob wrote that, for a time, it was the most influential book in the field of history of science, following the trend to relativism with its equation of \\"scientific discourses\\" with \\"strategies of power\\". J. L. Heilbron credits Shapin and Schaffer with picking important aspects of the development of experimental culture that are still relevant, citing specifically the problems with replication. However, he casts doubt upon the strength of the relationship between politics of the greater society and the politics within the Royal Society. In addition, Heilbron laments the absence of comparisons to the development of empiricism in the rest of Europe because it blinds the reader to what may have been peculiar to England's case. Anna Marie Roos, on the other hand, writes that Shapin and Schaffer do indeed draw a connection between the history of science and the history of political thought, and that their resolution to remain impartial when examining the argument between Hobbes and Boyle forces historians of science and politics alike to recognize the relationship between the two branches of knowledge.Roos http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=25967955484936 Lawrence M. Principe, in The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest, argues extensively that many of the conclusions reached by Shapin and Schaffer rest on inaccurate and at times presentist conceptions of Boyle's work.Lawrence M. Principe. The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest. Princeton University Press, Princeton 1998. . Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst deny the political background of the Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes‚Äô rejection of the void has no political agenda and has nothing to do with his attack on incorporeal substances, as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst call attention to the remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a vacuist, and long before he became a plenist.Noel Malcolm: Aspects of Hobbes. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2002. . pp. 187-191.Cees Leijenhorst: The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: the Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes‚Äô Natural Philosophy. Brill, Leiden 2002. . p. 127. Frank Horstmann, in Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe, has criticized Shapin and Schaffer's use of the historical evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer have a lot of important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as not imaginable;Thomas Hobbes: Thomas White‚Äôs De Mundo Examined. Bradford University Press, London 1976. p. 47 but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation.Shapin & Schaffer, p. 84 Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in Leviathan and the Air-Pump and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.Frank Horstmann: Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe. Mackensen, Berlin 2012. . Leviathan und die Erpumper. In the Introduction of the 2011 (second) edition of their book, the authors reflect on the book (mild, according to them) initial reception of the first edition before becoming considered a classic later on.

He was known for his small, usually imaginary landscapes in an Italianate style. Life Marten Ryckaert was a member of the Ryckaert (or Rijckaert) family of artists. He was born in Antwerp in 1587 as the second child of David Rijckaert the Elder and Catharina Rem.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 601-603 David the Elder was a brewer and a painter of wooden statues who had become a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1585.Bernadette Van Haute.

Volume 1, Doctoral thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Literature and Philosophy at the University of South Africa, November 1996, pp. 10-12 He is also mentioned as a dealer in paintings. David Rijckaert II had 7 siblings of whom his older brother David the Younger (born in 1586) became a prominent still life painter. He was the uncle of David Ryckaert III, a genre painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 754, 1059‚Äì1060 As the result of a birth defect or because of an accident, he had only one arm.

Marten became a member of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1607. It is believed he traveled to Italy between 1607 and 1610 although no documentary evidence of this trip has been found. It is believed that during his stay in Italy he practised plein air sketching.Martin Ryckaert (Antwerp 1587-1631), An extensive mountainous landscape with figures on horseback and others resting in the foreground, a winding river and a town beyond at Christie's Marten rejoined the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1611 and was registered as the \\"painter with one arm\\".Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He spent the remainder of his professional career in his native city. He was active in the local Chamber of rhetoric De Violieren. He never married and collected many paintings by his contemporaries in his house in the Meyerstraat in Antwerp.Martin Ryckaert in Wurzbach, Alfred von [Bearb.], Niederl√§ndisches K√ºnstlerlexikon: mit mehr als 3000 Monogrammen (Band 2): L - Z, Amsterdam, 1910 Landscape in the Rhine valley He was reportedly a close friend of Anthony van Dyck, who painted his portrait showing Ryckaert dressed up as a king around 1630. This portrait was in the possession of Marten Ryckaert when he died and is today in the Prado in Madrid.Sotheby's Important Old Master Paintings, Including European Works of Art, New York  29 janv. 2009 The portrait was engraved by Jacob Neefs and then included in van Dyck's book project entitled \\"Iconography\\" which contained portraits of famous people of that time.Moir, Alfred, Anthony van Dyck, Thames and Hudson, London, 1994, p. 98 Ryckaert fell ill in early 1631 and is buried in Antwerp on 11 October. He left his entire fortune to his sister Maria and his brother Pauwel (or Pauwels). Work His sparse surviving works mainly depict imaginary landscapes with forests, often with waterfalls, rocks, ruins, architecture and small human figures. Marten Ryckaert‚Äôs work shows similarities with that of the Antwerp painter Joos de MomperLandschap, Marten Rijckaert at Het Gulden Cabinet and also to that of Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel Hans Vlieghe (1998), Flemish Art and Architecture 1585-1700; Yale University Press, New Haven, 1998 Landscape with a farmer plowing and the fall of Icarus It is difficult to assess the stylistic development of his work. The landscapes are in an Italianate style and thus resemble those of the Rome-based Flemish landscape painter Paul Bril. This is particularly true for works from the period following his return from his presumed trip to Italy as Paul Bril's prints of Roman-style landscapes were widely disseminated in Antwerp at this time. The placement, style and grouping of the figures in the landscapes are indebted to Jan Brueghel the Elder. This is most obvious in works such as the Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (in a private collection) that is based on a lost original by Brueghel, although Ryckaert did not slavishly copy Brueghel's invention. The colour treatment resembles that of Joos de Momper. His style of painting became gradually obsolete during his own lifetime and was replaced by the Baroque style, which was characterized by a greater realism, greater scale, warmer colours and transparent light.Biographical details at the Nouvelle Biographie Nationale A rocky landscape with figures by an iron foundry His composition A rocky landscape with figures by an iron foundry has long been regarded as one of the oldest paintings of a blast furnace and refinery in Europe.Marten Ryckaert , A rocky landscape with figures by an iron foundry, a river and houses on the bank beyond at Christie's References External links * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish artists (before 1830) Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:1587 births Category:1631 deaths ","title":"Marten Ryckaert"},{"id":"12449831","text":"Joco Communications was a small Canadian radio broadcasting company, which operated radio stations in Sturgeon Falls and Espanola, Ontario.

Eisenbarth was an oculist and barber-surgeon who specialized in treatment of cataracts, calculus surgery, and the treatment of bone fractures. His grandfather and father were also surgeons, and much of Eisenbarth's medical knowledge was learned from his brother-in-law. Although he was referred to as \\"Dr. Eisenbarth\\", he had no formal medical credentials, nor was he officially awarded the title \\"Doctor\\". Despite this, he was considered a skilled surgeon, and was bestowed with privileges by members of German royalty. Eisenbarth was a \\"travelling surgeon\\", and his journeys took him throughout most of Germany. He usually travelled with a large entourage of up to 120 persons. This group included entertainers, harlequins and musicians performing in a carnival-like atmosphere while Eisenbarth plied his trade. The spectacle drew large crowds, and the loud music and revelry helped drown out the cries of pain from his patients. Eisenbarth designed his own medical instruments, including a cataract needle and a polypus hook. From his home in Magdeburg, the Zum goldenen Apfel, he manufactured and marketed his own medicine, selling his homemade remedies on a large scale. Around 1800, a student drinking song called \\"Ich bin der Doktor Eisenbarth\\" (My Name is Doctor Eisenbarth) unfairly mocking the memory of the doctor (\\"I can make the blind walk and the lame see\\") became popular in Germany, and more recently, author Eike Pies published a book titled Ich bin der Doktor Eisenbarth. In his home town of Oberviechtach, there is the \\"Eisenbarth Fountain\\", commemorating his work. Also, a pharmacy in Oberviechtach sells a product called \\"Eisenbarth elixir\\", and a 1977 German postage stamp features his visage.  Song  Today, Johann Andreas Eisenbarth is still widely known because about 70 years after his death a G√∂ttingen student, of whom only the beer name Perceo (\\"dwarf\\" or \\"Kleinw√ºchsiger\\") is known, wrote a drinking song, the first line of which reads: \\"Ich bin der Doktor Eisenbarth\\" (\\"I am the Doctor Eisenbarth\\"). As a student song, text and melody made their way through the student associations of the German universities in numerous variations from about 1800; in 1815 a variant was printed for the first time in a commercial book.Eike Pies: Eisenbarth. Das Ende einer Legende. 2004, S. 329. This song, in turn, inspired various authors to write novels to this day (Agnes Harder, 1897; Josef Winckler, 1928; Otto Weddigen, 1909; Fritz N√∂lle, 1940; Hanns Kneifel, 2002), plays (for example Otto Falckenberg, 1908), operas (Alfred B√∂ckmann and Pavel Haas) and Nico Dostal's operetta Doktor Eisenbart. The school opera Der Arzt auf dem Marktplatz by Hanna and Siegfried Stolte, written in the 1950s in the GDR, was also based on motifs from the life of Doctor Eisenbarth.

It was established in 1986 as part of an expansion of UTA's College of Engineering. The ARC contributes to the vision of UTA and the University of Texas System to transform the university into a full-fledged research institution. It showcases the aerodynamics research activities at UTA and, in its history, has established itself as a unique facility at a university level. The wind tunnels and equipment in the facility were mainly built by scouting for and upgrading decommissioned equipment from the government and industry. Currently, Masters and Ph.D. students perform research in the fields of high-speed gas dynamics, propulsion (including Pulse detonation engines), and Computational fluid dynamics among other projects related to aerodynamics.  History  The development of the ARC began in 1975 as an effort to develop a shock tube for experimental research in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation. At the same time, the engineering accreditation board recommended that the Aerospace Engineering Department (which has since merged back into the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering) should have a high speed wind tunnel capability. An arc heater was shipped to UTA but was put in storage because of a lack of funds to acquire the support equipment necessary for its operation. In 1976, two professors visited both the AEDC and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to view their transonic Ludwieg tube facilities. The idea was the build a smaller version of the wind tunnel at UTA, but when the AEDC facility was toured it was found that its Ludwieg tube had recently been decommissioned. The Ludwieg tube had been developed as a prototype for the Air Force concept for the National Transonic Facility Development Program, but the decision had recently been made to build the NTF at the NASA Langley Research Center using their cryogenic tunnel concept. The professors jokingly told the AEDC project manager to consider donating the tube to UTA, which was taken as a serious offer. The Ludwieg tube was declared government surplus and donated to UTA, showing up at the rail head in Arlington, Texas on three flat bed cars. Possession of the Ludwieg tube facility attracted lucrative grants, which became a logistical problem because UTA was then involved in a major building program that included the renovation of an engineering building that the tunnel was scheduled to go into. This would have meant a period of several years of storage and hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost grants. The solution to this problem was the construction of a temporary facility on the first floor of a newly built engineering building. This facility happened to be located underneath the office of the Dean of the College of Engineering, who promptly changed the temporary facility to a permanent building upon hearing how loud the Luwieg tube was. Once the concept of a permanent building was proposed, several new wind tunnels and equipment were added. In 1985, a large compressor located at NASA Ames Research Center became available and was donated to UTA. This 5-stage Clark compressor was rated at 3000 psi, 2000 cfm, and was driven by a 1250 hp motor. The total power consumption during full load operation is over 1.6 MW. Moving the compressor to a new building with its associated equipment cost nearly $500,000.00. The entire building was built around the compressor in 1986, and continued development has occurred since that time which includes the construction of supersonic and hypersonic facilities.  Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Laboratory  The low-speed wind tunnel is a closed-circuit, continuous flow tunnel with a 100 hp, variable frequency drive. The test section measures 0.6 by 0.9 meters and is capable of flow velocities up to 50 m/s. It is equipped with 3 and 6 component force balances and a PC-based multiplexed data acquisition system. Smoke visualization is also available. An auxiliary high pressure air supply enables the tunnel to be used for jet and surface blowing studies.  High Reynolds Number Transonic Ludwieg Tube Wind Tunnel  The high Reynolds number transonic Ludwieg tube wind tunnel has a porous wall test section that measures 19.5 by . It is an impulse facility with a run time of about 120 ms. The Mach number range is 0.5‚Äì1.2 and the Reynolds number range is 4‚Äì40 million/meter. The extremely high Reynolds number capability enables full-scale simulation of rotor aerodynamics. The tunnel has a low level of turbulence, with free stream pressure fluctuations of only 1 percent rms. It possesses a 5 component balance.  Supersonic Wind Tunnel  The supersonic wind tunnel is a blowdown type tunnel equipped with a variable Mach number nozzle. The wind tunnel was developed in-house except for the donation of a nozzle by LTV (presently Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control). The current achievable Mach number range is 1.5 to 4.0 with Reynolds numbers between 60 and 140 million per meter. The test section cross section area is 6 by 6.5 inches. The maximum upstream storage tank volume is 24.5 cubic meters at 700 psig.<  Hypersonic Shock Tunnel  The hypersonic shock tunnel is another impulse facility with a run time of 0.5 to 5.0 ms. The tunnel has a test section of 0.44 meters (diameter) by a length of 1 meter. The inviscid core is 0.17 m at Mach 8. It is capable of testing at Mach numbers from 5 to 16 and Reynolds numbers from 100 to 20 million per meter. The tunnel can be modified to accommodate a detonation driver using a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen and helium. This was completed in 1991, and led to a $1,000,000 grant to form the NASA/UTA Center for Hypersonic Research between 1993 and 1998.  Arc Heated Tunnel  The key component of the arc heated wind tunnel is a 2 MW DC electric arc heater. The test section is with a length. It is used to produce supersonic streams of extremely hot gas. The gas flowing through the arc heater is heated by a powerful electric arc to produce a gas stream with bulk temperatures ranging from 3000 to 5000 K. The facility is based on a Thermal Dynamics F-5000 arc heater, donated from the USAF Arnold Engineering Development Center. Additionally, the facility also consists of systems for nitrogen injection, water cooling, creating a vacuum and a transversing probe as well as facility monitoring and protection. The bulk total enthalpy output ranges from 4000 to 5800 kJ/kg, which is controlled by adjustments in the power supply output of current and the rate that gas is injected into the arc heater. The arc heater can be configured to produce a very peaked enthalpy distribution across the nozzle exit, which can give local total enthalpies roughly twice the bulk average level. Facility operations have demonstrated mass flow rates from 0.07‚Äì0.18 kg/s. The corresponding maximum run duration is 90‚Äì200 s. The maximum operating pressure for the arc heater is 20 atmospheres. A compressed air driven ejector pump provides vacuum conditions in the test section vessel during test runs. The ejector pump has produced test section pressures as low as 4.5 kPa (0.65 psia) without the arc heater running. A mechanical vacuum pump is available to provide a high initial vacuum in the facility's 4.25 cubic meter vacuum tank. The vacuum capability of the facility enables the use of high expansion ratio nozzles with the arc heater. A programmable, 3-axis traverse system allows probe surveys to be performed within a space of wide, long and deep (8 x 9 x 12 inches). This system can be used to mount models or test articles as well.<  Faculty  *Luca Maddalena, Ph.D. ‚Äì Director *Frank K. Lu, Ph.D., P.E. - Former Director *Donald R.

New director leads Library school into Information Age. University Week. Archived Copy History In 1911 it was a library school founded by Harriet Howe, Josephine Meissner, William E. Henry and Charles W. Smith, established in response to a growing need in the Western United States for highly trained, well-prepared librarians. history] Prior to 1911, untrained librarians in the Pacific Northwest were trained through a six-week summer course offered at the University of Washington. Name changes include: (1911-1916) Department of Library Economy; (1916-1932) Library School; (1932-1935) Department of Library Science in the Graduate School; (1935-1984) School of Librarianship; and (1984-2001) Graduate School of Library and Information Science. Finally, in 2001, the school was renamed the Information School, becoming the newest independent school at the University of Washington. The Information School introduced several new continuing education certificate programs and degree programs in 2000 in response to changes in how people create, store, find, manipulate and share information. Under the leadership of Professor and Dean Emeritus Michael Eisenberg, the Information School introduced the Bachelor of Science in Informatics, online Master of Library and Information Science, Master of Science in Information Management, and Ph.D. in Information Science.

The Informatics program is a competitive two-year program focused on the design of information systems and services, with particular emphasis on the following areas: * Human-computer interaction * Information architecture * Cybersecurity and information assurance * Data Science The program touches on privacy issues, ethics, and management, as well as design, search engines, web development, and database design. Students study a broad range of areas in the information field, including: information management and technology, information-related research, interactive system design, human-computer interaction, and information science. The program's curriculum culminates in a design or research capstone project. The Informatics program has the largest enrollment of any program at the iSchool. Graduates of the program typically go on to jobs such as: * Information architect * Web designer * Content Strategist * Interface designer * Network administrator * IT director/manager * Database manager * Software engineer * Technology solutions consultant * Project manager * Web developer * Systems analyst * Business analyst * Program Manager * Product Planner * User experience designer * Usability engineer * Network manager * Information security and assurance professional * Software Developer Informatics minor In 2017, the Information School added an Informatics minor. The minor complements a variety of majors on campus by offering students an opportunity to learn about data, design, policy, ethics, and code in order to solve information problems. It may be especially helpful to students in the humanities and social sciences who wish to know more about data, code, design, and policy. Master's programs The Information School offers two master's degrees: the Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) and the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS). Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) The MSIM program (Master of Information Management) requires two years to earn the degree and takes a multidisciplinary approach to the management of information systems and policy. It draws on computer science, business, information science, philosophy, design, and law to inform its curriculum. The MSIM program is divided into two sub-programs: 1) a day program, a traditional, daytime program for students of all academic and work backgrounds; and 2) an executive program, an evening and weekend program tailored to working professionals. Graduates work in a variety of professional areas and positions, including, but not limited to: * Information Architect * User Experience Designer * Data Visualization Specialist * Systems Analyst * Data Scientist * Software Design Engineer * Risk Consultant * Web Computing Specialist * Network Administrator * Database Developer * Cybersecurity Professional * Project ManagerUW ISchool. Overview - Info Mgmt (MSIM). University of Washington Information School. Retrieved October 26, 2017. Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) The MLIS is the iSchool's oldest degree. It is a two-year professional degree that prepares students for careers in library and information professions. Like its sister, the MSIM program, the MLIS program is divided into two sub-programs: 1) a day program for traditional students, and 2) a distance program for geographically disparate students. In 2017 the iSchool's MLIS program was ranked #2 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.US News & World Report 2017 Library and Information Studies School Rankings Additionally, the iSchool offers a third MLIS degree--the Law MLIS program, a one-year degree designed to prepare lawyers to serve as law librarians. The Law Librarianship program was the highest-ranked program in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in 2017.US News & World Report 2017 Library and Information Studies School Rankings Ph.D. program The Ph.D. program is a theoretical, research-based doctorate in the field of Information Science. Research areas include data science, digital youth, health and well- being, human-computer interaction, indigenous knowledge, information and society, learning sciences, library and information sciences, and socio- technical information systems. Ph.D. program alumni have gone on to careers in public sectors (tenure-track faculty, post-doctoral researchers, administrators in higher education) and private sectors (industry researchers, business/industry positions). Leadership The Founding Board offers strategic advice to the dean with a focus on building awareness of and attracting resources to the Information School. The Founding Board also leads fundraising initiatives for the Information School. Faculty As of October 2017, the Information School's faculty numbered 54 core members, along with numerous adjunct and affiliated faculty members. The school makes recruitment and retention of traditionally underrepresented groups among the priorities of its Faculty Affairs division. Working with the iSchool's Diversity Programs Coordinator, the UW Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement, and others, Faculty Affairs works to address systemic barriers and roadblocks through changes in policy and practice and in dialogue with the faculty and the community.

He was released in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Background and IRA activity McGinn was born into an Irish republican family in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, Ireland. His father was a former Sinn F√©in councillor and his brother-in-law, Caoimhgh√≠n √ì Caol√°in, has been a Sinn F√©in TD for Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan since 1997. In 1978 Dessie O'Hare and McGinn killed Thomas Johnston, a former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) in Keady, South Armagh. In 1979 McGinn was arrested at a disused farmhouse and charged with possession of explosives. He failed to turn up at his trial and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in absentia. After several months on the run, he was arrested in Dundalk following a 27-hour siege, during which he held a family hostage with a pistol and a hand grenade. McGinn was released from prison in 1987, and joined the IRA's South Armagh Brigade. Initially viewed as an outsider, within several years he became a trusted member of the brigade, helping assemble bombs used by the IRA in England. He was a member of one of two sniper teams which killed nine members of the security forces between 1992 and 1997, including Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, who was killed by a single shot from a Barrett M90 sniper rifle on 12 February 1997, and was the last British Army soldier to be killed during The Troubles.Harnden, pp. 387‚Äì90. Arrest and trial McGinn and other members of the sniper team were arrested by the Special Air Service at a farm near Crossmaglen on 10 April 1997, and taken to Gough Barracks in Armagh for questioning. During a week of questioning, McGinn confessed to his role in the IRA bombing campaign, and implicated more than twenty members of the South Armagh Brigade in attacks in Northern Ireland and England. He claimed to have manufactured explosive mixes varying from between 200 pounds and 10 tons, and said it was \\"like a day's work\\". On 19 March 1999 McGinn was sentenced to a total of 490 years' imprisonment for 34 separate offences, including the murder of three British soldiers, and involvement in the 1992 bombing of the Baltic Exchange, the 1996 Docklands bombing, and the bombing of Hammersmith Bridge later the same year. He laughed at his sentence, knowing that he would be freed, at most, in shortly over a year under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Two months after his conviction McGinn was temporarily released on compassionate grounds to visit his sick mother, which caused anger and consternation among unionists. On 28 July 2000, McGinn was freed from HM Prison Maze, after serving 16 months. Appeal On 5 October 2000 McGinn's convictions for explosives offences and the soldiers' murders were overturned at the Court of Appeal in Belfast on the grounds that he was not properly cautioned before he confessed. The court, however, dismissed his appeals against convictions for conspiracy to murder and firearms possession for which he received a twenty-year sentence at his original trial. Death McGinn was found dead at a house in Monaghan Town on 21 December 2013.

Sri Lanka has recognized transgender people for a very long time and has been making it easier for transgender people to identify and transition in recent years. Concepts similar to the third gender found in India and South East Asia also exist in Sri Lanka.  Overview  The current legal framework of Sri Lanka mostly derives from the European/Christian constructs was imported into the island during the colonial era, most of it being predominantly British law and the prior colonial Roman-Dutch law. The most famous of these discriminatory laws is the now dormant (and variously reported as decriminalized) Section 365 that criminalizes homosexual sex, but other laws against gender impersonation and pimping can also be considered to discriminate against LGBT people. Further problems with the colonial legal framework include the lack of protections and supports for the sexual minority community, including the lack of specific wording fighting discrimination against sexual minorities nor the recognition of transgender and third gender concepts (who have been technically discriminated against through the Vargrants Ordinance). The Supreme Court and the various Governments of Sri Lanka have however attempted to remedy this situation by including sexual minorities within generic anti-discrimination clauses and attempting to set dormant a variety of laws (though the colonial legal code does not provide the Supreme Court with the power to create or repeal law). The political parties of Sri Lanka are formed through collations of numerous smaller parties reminiscent of the party politics in former colonial power Netherlands, and hence confusion and constant movement can be found in terms of their stances to homosexuality. Both the conservative government of Srisena and the socialist government of Rajapaska have stated that discrimination against sexual minorities is unconstitutional and that Section 365 cannot be legally applied to consensual homosexual sex, but in contradiction to this the socialist collation refused to allow the conservative government's attempted deletion of Section 365 from legal texts. A number of non-governmental organizations, lawmakers and religious organizations have come out in favor of sexual minorities, and openly homosexual gay and transgender lawmakers can be found in the parliament and the government. A variety of public institutions including the health service and the police have been introducing internal commitments to improve living conditions for sexual minorities. Sri Lankan societies generally takes a modestly unobtrusive and traditionalist view of homosexuality and certain traditions exist for the promotion of transgenders (albeit third gender appears to have escaped the island despite it having roots historically within Sri Lankan culture) and consequently these laws have mostly been applied loosely (if ever) and discrimination by police (and the like) is often associated with corruption and/or attitudes towards sexual promiscuity which are applied to heterosexuals as well. A number of issues remain untouched by general discussion including that of the status of sexual minorities within the military service, and intersex rights have mostly escaped both mainstream discussion and discussion by LGBT lobbies. Other laws and legalities that can negatively affect sexual minorities are more widely discussion in the Sexual minorities in Sri Lanka article. In 1994, Sherman de Rose set up Companions on a Journey (CoJ), the first LGBT support group in Sri Lanaka. The Women's Support Group split off from CoJ in 1999, forming a separate organisation for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women. Equal Ground was then set up as a LGBTI group. Legality of same-sex sexual acts  Section 365 and 365A  These sections of the Penal Code refer to unnatural offences and acts of gross indecency. They state that the act should be \\"punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not more than 10 years with a fine. As of 2019 Global News claims that the country is not known to have convicted anyone under those provisions since 1948, but in 1995, the section was amended slightly to expressly prohibit \\"gross indecency\\" no matter the gender of the participants. In November 2017, Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle stated that the government would move to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity. The country's constitution does not provide the Supreme Court the powers to completely expel a law from the books. An attempt by the government to include its repeal into the human rights action plan was prevented by opposition from the United People's Freedom Alliance.  Supreme Court  The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has recognized that \\"the contemporary thinking, that consensual sex between people of the same sex should not be policed by the state nor should it be grounds for criminalisation\\" and that homosexuality cannot be criminalised.  Government  Both the socialist government of Rajapaska and the conservative government of Sirisena have stated \\" that discrimination against LGBT people was unconstitutional and that the application of sections 365 and 365A in a manner that was discriminatory against LGBT persons was unconstitutional\\".  Section 399  This section criminalized gender impersonation and is often used against transgender people. It can used in situations where a person has converted to another gender yet bears a different gender on their documentation.  Section 07 / 1841 Vagrants Ordinance  This act criminalizes soliciting and acts of indecency in public places. It has been used against sex workers and sexual minorities. A maximum term of six months and a fine of 100 rupees is imposed as punishment. Recognition of same-sex relationships Sri Lankan family law does not recognize same-sex marriages or same-sex civil unions. Discrimination protections  Constitutional Protections  The Government of Sri Lanka claimed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee on 7‚Äì8 October 2014 that they think sexual minorities should be protected under existing generic anti- discrimination laws provided in the Constitution. The Government of Sri Lanka stated that such protections were \\"'implicit' in the Sri Lankan constitution and that the Government has not written a law giving 'explicit' rights yet. Discrimination against sexual minorities still remains a problem. Several lawyers and charities have called for specific wording in the constitution stating that discrimination against sexual minorities is illegal.  Law  In 2017, the Government also decided to update their Human Rights Action Plan with an addendum that bans discrimination against someone based on his or her sexual orientation. However, no laws were put in place following this statement. Both the socialist government of Rajapaska and the conservative government of Sirisena have stated \\" that discrimination against LGBT people was unconstitutional and that the application of sections 365 and 365A in a manner that was discriminatory against LGBT persons was unconstitutional\\".  Gender Identity and expression  Gender dysphoria is classified as a mental health problem.  Third Gender  The concept of third gender is not recognized under Sri Lankan law.  Blood Donation  The National Blood Transfusion Service bans people who engage in risk behavior from donating blood. It classifies homosexual sex as a risk behavior, along with unrelated behaviors such drug use and having more than one sexual partner, so consequently LGBT who engage in homosexual sex are banned from donating blood through the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS). Summary table {  - Legality of same-sex sexual activity  Though ruled unenforceable by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Article 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code criminalizes \\"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\\" with penalties of 10 years in prison and fines. -  Anti-discrimination laws  -  Marriage between two same sex persons  No -  Recognition of same sex couples  No -  Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples  No -  Joint adoption by same-sex couples  No -  LGBT people allowed to serve openly in the military  No -  The right to change legal gender  -  Recognition of third gender  No -  Access to IVF for lesbians  No -  Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples  No -  Removal of LGBT orientation as a mental illness  -  Banning of gay conversion therapy  No -  MSMs allowed to donate blood  No } See also *Human rights in Sri Lanka *LGBT rights in Asia *Tamil sexual minorities *Sexual minorities in Sri Lanka References External links *Sri Lankan Gay Community forum *Equal Ground *Gay Sri Lanka Community Story Category:Sri Lankan law ","title":"LGBT rights in Sri Lanka"},{"id":"12449932","text":"Colin George Pratt (born 10 October 1938)Oakes, P.(2006). Speedway Star Almanac. is a former motorcycle speedway rider and later promoter of the Coventry Bees who compete in the British Elite League. Racing career Born in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, Pratt lived near to Mike Broadbank from whom he bought his first speedway bike at the age of nineteen, and practiced at the nearby Rye House track.Oakes, Peter (1963) \\"A Peter Oakes Speedtale on Colin Pratt: Saints Must Regret Their Decision\\", Speedway Star, 27 July 1963, p. 16 After his National Service, he returned to the Rye House training track in 1960 and had his first competitive rides, reaching the final of the Whitsun Trophy. He was signed by the Southampton Saints, where he made his National League debut against Oxford. A broken wrist sustained at Swindon brought his debut season to an early end. He had only second-half rides for Southampton in 1961, and was loaned to Poole Pirates for whom he rode in three matches, Ipswich Witches (two matches), and then Stoke Potters where he started to score well, with paid 15 points against Wolverhampton and a 12-point maximum against Cradley Heath. In 1962 he scored 177 points from 34 matches for the Potters, and improved further in 1963, scoring 141 points in his first 12 matches and winning all five races to win the Gerry Hussey Memorial Trophy at Rye House, breaking the track record during the meeting. He moved on to the Swindon Robins before joining the Hackney Hawks in 1964. He rode for the Hawks for six years until the 1970 season when he moved to the Cradley Heath Heathens. However, he was forced to retire after he was involved in a road crash near Lokeren in Belgium. Five riders and officials died.Belton, Brian (2003). Hammerin' Round. Pratt was riding as a guest for the West Ham Hammers against a Danish select side in the Netherlands (in which he gained a five ride maximum). He sustained three broken bones in his neck and was warned by doctors that if he rode again and broke it he would be paralysed. After deciding the risk was too great he retired. Pratt was also a full England international and rode in two World Team Cup finals. He also qualified for the final of the Speedway World Championship in 1967.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. It was as a Hackney rider that he won the London Riders' Championship in 1967 and again in 1968. Promoter and team manager Pratt became co-promoter at the Rye House Rockets with former boss Len Silver in 1979. In 1983, he spent a season as team manager at King's Lynn Stars before becoming promoter at Cradley Heath in 1984. He stayed at Cradley until 1996 where he became co-promoter of the ill-fated London Lions, based at the Hawks' previous stadium, Hackney Wick. By now it had been redeveloped and renamed the London Stadium. The promotion closed after one season so Pratt moved to the Bradford Dukes as team manager. In 1998, the opportunity arose to join the Coventry Bees as promoter and Pratt has been there ever since in promoter/co- promoter and team manager roles. He also had an eight-year spell as the Great Britain team manager (with Eric Boocock). He has won sixteen major trophies as a manager or promoter. He has served several terms on the British Speedway Promoters' Association management committee.

The Penal Code (articles 213 and 214) state that same-sex sexual acts are punishable by a prison sentence of between one month to less than one year. However, the law is not enforced and is currently being reviewed by the Parliament. LGBT people in Bhutan face little violence or persecution, though most Bhutanese did not know they even exist with the idea of being gay or transgender \\"pretty much unheard of.\\" In recent years, due to Bhutan opening up more to the outside world, Bhutanese LGBT people have started to publicly come out and establish visible outlets for the LGBT community. Therefore, attitudes among the general population are changing. Legality of same-sex sexual activity Section 213 of the Bhutan Penal Code 2004 states, Section 214 states, The United States Department of State issues this warning to LGBT travelers to Bhutan: \\"Although there are no laws that explicitly prohibit consensual same-sex sexual activity, laws against \\"sodomy or any other sexual conduct that is against the order of nature\\" exist. Under the Penal Code, a person can be imprisoned for as long as one year for engaging in such acts. One government official noted that prosecution under this law is rare, as criminal intent must be proven by the prosecution. There have been no reported cases of such charges. Decriminalisation efforts Some members of the Parliament of Bhutan have publicly called for the laws to be repealed. On 29 May 2019, the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2019 () was introduced by the Chairperson of the Legislative Committee, MP Tshewang Lhamo (DNT), to the Parliament of Bhutan. At first, the removal of sections 213 and 214 was not proposed in the bill. However, the Minister of Finance, Namgay Tshering (DNT), suggested the change as a comment and said that section 213 should change \\"to keep up with the times\\". The Legislative Committee of the National Assembly was supportive. When the bill was referred to the Legislative Committee, it decided to take the Finance Minister's suggestion seriously, and asked him to give it in writing, which the Finance Minister agreed to do, and allowing the committee the ability to propose it as an amendment. Tshering said \\"My primary reason is that this section is there since 2004 but it has become so redundant and has never been enforced. It is also an eyesore for international human rights bodies.\\", and that the sections had become \\"a stain\\" on the country's reputation. On 7 June 2019, the National Assembly approved the bill in a first reading. On 10 June 2019, the bill passed the second and final reading with 38 votes in favour votes and 1 vote against, with 5 absentations. The bill was sent to the National Council for the winter session 6 months later. On 10 February 2020, the Council voted it with amendment by 19 votes in favour and 6 abstentions.NC adopts the Civil and Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2019 Having been amended, the bill was sent back to the lower house, who adopted it on 27 February by 34 votes for, 1 against, and 7 abstentions, but rejected 32 of the 56 amendments proposed by the upper house, meaning it will be sent to a joint committee for reviews and voted on by a joint sitting of both houses. It will then be sent for royal assent once passed.National Assembly re-deliberates and passes the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill of Bhutan 2019 The joint committee convened on 7 October 2020.https://www.nationalcouncil.bt/en/media/view_news_detail/748 Recognition of same-sex relationship Currently, Bhutan does not provide any form of legal recognition for same-sex couples. Tashi Tsheten, director of Rainbow Bhutan, said that a marriage bill with gender-neutral pronouns was placed during the 2018 summer parliamentary session but was deferred due to the 2018 Bhutanese National Assembly election. With the newly elected left- wing government in place, Tsheten and the community believes that the conversation around the bill will be revived. Blood donation According to the Bhutan Medical and Health Council, anyone in good health aged at least 18 years and weighing at least 45 kg (100 lbs) may donate. Until recently, there have been few restrictions on blood donations in Bhutan. Living conditions Ignorance about homosexuality is common due to stereotypes in popular culture. Bhutanese culture does not share the typical Western view of heterosexuality and homosexuality. Some have referred to it as an openly bisexual society, although this is disputed. Women are more likely than men to be open about their sexual orientation. There are cultural and traditional struggles for those who seek acceptance. According to a 2016 Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) survey, over 42% of transgender women and 23% of gay and bisexual men in Bhutan had attempted suicide more than once. The survey also found that transgender women and gay and bisexual men were often victims of \\"extreme physical and sexual violence\\". A 2019 study to see how sections 213 and 214 affected the community showed that 69% of the respondents felt the two clauses impacted them negatively. In 2013, the introduction of Facebook led to increased visibility for the LGBT community with the creation of dedicated Facebook groups. In 2014, Rainbow Bhutan was set up as a community for LGBT people with five members; this grew to 136 members in 2019. In 2019, LGBT activist Tashi Tsheten said that the full LGBT movement started from 2015 onwards, when the community started organising programmes on HIV. In 2017, LGBT groups began advocating outside of the scope of HIV/AIDS and began working more in the open. In 2015, activist and physiotherapist Passang Dorji came out as gay for the first time on national television. In February 2015, Karma Dupchen, a civil engineer and LGBT activist, created LGBT Bhutan, Bhutan's first ever Facebook page dedicated to spread awareness about the LGBT community. Buddhism, the main religion of Bhutan does not condemn homosexuality. In 2015, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Bhutan's most prominent Buddhist teacher, said that sexual orientation has nothing to do with who will reach enlightenment. He further stated that Bhutanese should not merely tolerate gay people but should respect them. He said, \\"Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with understanding or not understanding the truth. You could be gay, you could be lesbian, you could be straight, we never know which one will get enlightened first‚Ä¶ Tolerance is not a good thing. If you are tolerating this, it means that you think it's something wrong that you will tolerate. But you have to go beyond that ‚Äì you have to respect.\\" Bhutan Observer, one of the country's main weekly newspapers, has written a significant number of articles on LGBT issues which elicited a lot of interest, making them the most commented articles on the paper's website. The government-supported newspaper Kuensel, meanwhile, has referred to gays as being the \\"Third Gender\\" in an article discussing HIV programmes targeted towards gay men. In November 2017, a presentation to sensibilise senior police officers on the stigmatisation faced by LGBT people was held in Phuentsholing. Police officials said the presentation has sensitised them further and made them understand issues related to the LGBT community. Chief of Police Colonel Chimi Dorji said, \\"After the training, we will come up with a procedural guidebook on LGBT. We will then distribute it among the officers. It will help us to deal with the LGBT community in a free and fair manner\\". The International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia was first celebrated in Bhutan in 2016. United Nations offices in the country launched a video campaign to defend the rights of LGBT people. The LGBT pride flag was flown in the country for the first time, at the UN House in Thimphu. In 2018, the event was celebrated at Hotel Migmar with government representatives as well as from civil society and the media. The event has been observed each year ever since. There is no annual gay pride parade or other public display in Bhutan. LGBT activist Tashi Tsheten has said that they do not plan on holding one, not because of a hostile environment or oppressive government, but because \\"pride parades are a form of activism where people go out on the streets and talk about policy and legal changes; and that's not something that Bhutanese agree with. We believe in building human relations and talking one- to-one. Connecting heart-to-heart. That's where the real change happens\\". Deyon Phuntsho and Tenzin Gyeltshen, a same-sex couple who went public with their relationship in 2018, reported being fully accepted by their families and friends. Tashi Tsheten, director of Rainbow Bhutan, said although there was a general acceptance of transgender people, especially in rural areas, they still face much discrimination, especially in schools, saying that \\"there are lots of barriers and our education system does not understand LGBT,\\" adding that most LGBT youths drop out of school. Terminology In 2015, the Dzongkha Development Commission, which seeks to promote and protect the Dzongkha language and introduce new words, announced Dzongkha terms for lesbian (), gay (), bisexual (), transgender (), transvestite (), intersex (), homosexuality (), and homophobia (). The word \\"chakka\\" is an Indian slang term used as a slur for gay and effeminate men. The word \\"phomenmomen\\", meaning not male and not female, is used to label a gay person, but a more correct translation might be \\"intersex\\". Gay Bhutanese do not like nor use this word. Gay men themselves use English terms to describe themselves: \\"gay king\\" is an older top, \\"gay queen\\" is an older bottom, \\"freaking prince\\" is a young top, \\"freaking princess\\" is a young bottom, and \\"closet celebrity\\" refers to a closeted man that everyone knows is gay. Political support LGBT activist Tashi Tsheten said that, previously, in 2009 and 2010, Bhutanese officials would state at international conferences that the country had no homosexuals at all. Dasho Neten Zangmo, the head of Bhutan's Anti-Corruption Commission described as \\"the most important woman in the country\\" and the \\"Iron Lady of Bhutan\\", was the first senior Bhutanese government official to make a comment about gay Bhutanese, when she said in a speech in August 2014 to high school students: \\"Romantic relationships, by the way, can be boy-boy or girl-girl.\\" In 2016, two Bhutanese National Assembly members Madan Kumar Chhetri and Ugyen Wangdi attended the Salzburg Global LGBT Forum, hosted by the Salzburg Global Seminar and held in Chiang Rai, Thailand, alongside two Bhutanese LGBT rights activists. The Bhutan Kuen-Nyam Party (BKP) has expressed support for LGBT rights. In 2018, the party included the rights of LGBT people in their manifesto for the 2018 Bhutanese National Assembly election. In June 2019, during the parliamentary debate on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, some MPs called for enacting legislation granting LGBT people some rights. MP Tshewang Lhamo (DNT), the chairperson of the Legislative Committee said, \\"A lot of people are affected in our society because of Sections 213 and 214. We must understand that laws need to be changed as per the changing times. Everyone should have the freedom of choice. We only consider male preferring female and vis-√†-vis as natural, and anything beyond that as unnatural. People must know that everyone is equal before the law irrespective of who they are. This particular Section 213 discriminates against a section of people and this is the reason why our committee has come up with a proposal to remove this section.\\" MP Kinley Wangchuk (DNT) said, \\"Even if there is no harm, we must not look at the law based not only on the country-level, but globally. It's also not fine if it is kept as it is. On a global level, outsiders might think there is no law at all meant for LGBT community and that they are considered as an invisible section of society, which might create a suspicion. Rather than removing the section, it's also important that we make a clear legal rights for them first\\". MP Jurmi Wangchuk (DNT) echoed Wangchuk's statement. Public opinion One of the first LGBT-related opinion polls in Bhutan carried out by an exchange student at the Royal Thimphu College on campus with 150 participants resulted in the following responses in 2013. 60% of the respondents believed that homosexuality is immoral and 40% believed that homosexuality should be accepted and homosexuals protected from discrimination and harm. However, with only 150 participants and all of which were within a single area, the validity of the poll to be used as a national basis is very lacking. Demographics According to 2018 estimates from the United Nations Development Programme, there were about 9,100 men who have sex with men in the capital Thimphu. In 2019, the government-supported newspaper Kuensel stated that there were 316 people registered as LGBT in the country. Of these, 3 were lesbian, 21 transgender women, 31 transgender men, 3 bisexual women, 16 bisexual men and 62 gays. 10 were below the age of 19 years, 93 were between 20‚Äì30 years and 33 above 30 years. This number was 97 in 2017 and 118 in 2018. HIV/AIDS Lhak-Sam (BNP+) is the country's first association of HIV positive people. The association was formed in September 2009 and was registered as a civil society organization in November 2010. Although gay and bisexual men are 19 times more vulnerable and transgender women are approximately 34-47 times more vulnerable to HIV infections, as of 2018 Bhutan has only one recorded case of HIV infection in the LGBT community.

Homosexuality is illegal in Brunei. Sexual relations between men are punishable by death or whipping; sex between women is punishable by caning or imprisonment. The sultanate currently has a moratorium in effect on death penalty. OutRight Action International has described Brunei as \\"the country that has the most worrisome state of rights for LGBT people in Southeast Asia\\". LGBT Bruneians feel the need to remain very discreet about their sexual orientation. The Brunei Project, established in 2015, seeks to promote human rights, including religious freedom, free speech, and LGBT rights in Brunei through social media. The group organised a private community event in 2016, celebrating Brunei's first \\"International Day Against Homophobia\\" event.Welcome to IDAHOT Newbies! Legality of same-sex sexual activity Prior to the current law, homosexuality was illegal and punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the act was done in private and consensual. In 2014, Brunei announced it will begin imposing Sharia law. It was scheduled to be enacted on 3 April 2019. American actor George Clooney wrote an open letter calling for the boycott of the Sultan of Brunei's hotels, including The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel- Air. When the move to Sharia Law was announced, the United Nations urged Brunei to review its laws in this area, which has been described by many media outlets as \\"medieval\\", \\"uncivilized\\" and \\"a return to the Stone Age\\". Their implementation was delayed until April 2019, after the Sultan declared that these laws should be regarded as \\"special guidance\\" from God. Sexual relations between men are punished through death by stoning if they admit it or were seen by four eyewitnesses doing so. Sexual relations between women will be punishable by either being lashed 40 times by a cane or a maximum prison term of 10 years.Brunei introduces stoning to death for gay sex, adultery LGBT people, as well as the Christian and Buddhist minorities, have been advised by international human rights activists to remain discreet in the country. Anyone caught \\"tarnishing the image of Islam\\" is heavily punished. In May 2019, after widespread international condemnation and media attention, the Brunei government extended its existing moratorium on the death penalty to the Sharia criminal code as well that made homosexual acts punishable with death by stoning. Gender identity and expression Brunei does not allow changing one's name or gender on official documents.https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_Trans_Legal_Mapping_Report_2017_ENG.pdf Sex reassignment surgery is not allowed.

Bruneian society tends to associate homosexuality with \\"effeminate men\\". In 2011, academics at the University of Brunei made a formal study of gay people in Brunei. The study illustrated how they chose to remain silent and discreet about their sexual orientation. The researchers were only able to find 29 LGBT respondents, some of whom were foreigners.Gay Life in Brunei The country had a total population of 411,900 .

The film follows two dancers who strive to preserve their own integrity while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the affections of a wealthy young suitor. In the decades following its release, the film was subject of critical reassessment and began to garner a reputation as a feminist film. In 2007, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\", describing it as Arzner's \\"most intriguing film\\" and a \\"meditation on the disparity between art and commerce. Dance, Girl, Dance was edited by Robert Wise, whose next film as editor was Citizen Kane and who later won Oscars as director of West Side Story and The Sound of Music.  Plot  While dancing at the Palais Royale in Akron, Ohio, Bubbles, a cynical blonde chorine, and Judy O'Brien, an aspiring young ballerina, meet Jimmy Harris, the scion of a wealthy family. Both women are attracted to Jimmy, a tormented young man who is still in love with his estranged wife, Elinor. Back in New York, Bubbles finds work in a burlesque club, while Madame Basilova, the girls' teacher and manager, arranges an audition for Judy with ballet impresario Steve Adams. En route to the audition, Madame Basilova is run over by a car and killed, and Judy, intimidated by the other dancers, flees before she can meet Steve. As she leaves the building, Judy shares an elevator with Steve, who offers her a cab ride, but she is unaware of who he is and rejects his offer. Soon after, Bubbles, now called \\"Tiger Lily, the burlesque queen\\", offers Judy a job as her stooge in the Bailey Brothers burlesque show and, desperate, Judy accepts. One night, both Jimmy and Steve attend the performance, and Judy leaves with Jimmy and tears up the card that Steve left for her. The next night, while at a nightclub with Judy, Jimmy has a fistfight with his ex-wife's new husband, and the next day their pictures appear in the newspaper. Bubbles, furious with Judy for stealing Jimmy, appears at the girl's apartment, where she finds Jimmy drunk on the doorstep and sweeps him away to the marriage bureau. Meanwhile, Steve's secretary, Miss Olmstead, also sees Judy's picture in the paper and identifies her as the dancer who had come to audition. That night, Steve attends Judy's performance at which the audience is given a lecture by Judy about the evils of viewing women as objects. This is followed by a fight between her and Bubbles over Jimmy. Hauled into night court, Judy is sentenced to ten days in jail but is bailed out by Steve. The next day, when Judy goes to meet her benefactor, she recognizes Steve, who hails her as his new discovery and promises to make her a star. Cast Release Box office The film was a critical and commercial failure, and its theatrical release lost RKO Studios roughly $400,000.Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p150 Critical response Writing for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther panned the film, noting that, \\"with the exception of Maureen O'Hara, who is sincere but badly miscast, the roles are competently filled and the film pretentiously staged, Dance, Girl, Dance is just a clich√©-ridden, garbled repetition of the story of the aches and pains in a dancer's rise to fame and fortune. It's a long involved tale told by a man who stutters... Nevertheless, it is Miss Ball who brings an occasional zest into the film, especially that appearance in the burlesque temple where she stripteases the Hays office. But it isn't art.\\"  Modern assessment  Beginning in the 1970s, Dance, Girl, Dance enjoyed a popular revival and critical reassessment. Its resurgence has been ascribed to the burgeoning feminist movement which saw the film as a rare example of empowered women. Critical praise for the film has endured ‚Äì in 2002 Dance, Girl, Dance was listed among the Top 100 \\"Essential Films\\" of the National Society of Film Critics. Alicia Fletcher, writing for the Toronto International Film Festival, deemed the film \\"A bone fide feminist masterpiece.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote: \\"The movie lives up to its title‚Äîits subject really is dancing. Arzner films it with fascination and enthusiasm, and the choreography is marked by the point of view of the spectators and the dancers‚Äô awareness that they're being watched. Arzner‚Äîone of the few women directors in Hollywood‚Äîshows women dancers enduring men's slobbering stares. The very raison d‚Äô√™tre of these women's performances is to titillate men, and that's where the story's two vectors intersect‚Äîart versus commerce and love versus lust. This idealistic paean to the higher realms of creative and romantic fulfillment is harshly realistic about the degradations that women endure in base entertainments.\\" References External links *Dance, Girl, Dance essay by Carrie Rickey at National Film Registry *Dance, Girl, Dance essay essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C; Black, 2010 , pages 316-318 * * American Film Institute * Masaryak University * Australian Centre For The Moving Image * IMDb * TCM * Library of Congress * Obscure Hollywood * Quart, B.

As the title holders, they were given a bye directly to the first round, where they were drawn against Austrian champions Rapid Wien. Two goals each from Alfredo Di St√©fano and Ram√≥n Marsal gave them a 4‚Äì2 win in the first leg at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium. In the second leg, Ernst Happel scored a hat- trick to put Rapid 3‚Äì0 ahead, but a Di St√©fano goal made the score 3‚Äì1. The game finished 5‚Äì5 on aggregate. As the away goals rule was not implemented until 1965, a play-off took place at the Bernab√©u, where goals from Jose√≠to and Raymond Kopa gave Madrid a 2‚Äì0. The quarter-finals saw Madrid take on French champions Nice. A Jose√≠to goal and two from Enrique Mateos gave Madrid a 3‚Äì0 win at home. In the away tie, Jacques Foix pulled a goal back for Nice, but another goal from Jose√≠to and two by Di St√©fano secured Madrid's victory; a late penalty by Nice's Ferry meant the tie finished 6‚Äì2 on aggregate. Manchester United were Madrid's opponents in the semi-finals. Goals from H√©ctor Rial and Di St√©fano put Madrid 2‚Äì0 up just after the hour mark; Manchester United pulled a goal back through Tommy Taylor, but Mateos' goal a minute later cancelled it out. Kopa and Rial each scored in the first half in the second leg at Old Trafford, which practically put the tie beyond doubt, though Taylor and Bobby Charlton scored in the second half to reduce the aggregate score to 5‚Äì3. That result sent Real Madrid through to their second straight European Cup final. Fiorentina Fiorentina qualified after winning the 1955‚Äì56 Serie A. They were placed into the South-Central Europe group for the preliminary round draw, but were not among the first four teams drawn and received a bye to the first round. There they faced IFK Norrk√∂ping of Sweden, who had also received a bye. In the first leg at Stadio Artemio Franchi, they fell behind to an early goal by Harry Bild, but equalised shortly afterwards and the match finished 1‚Äì1. In the second leg, Giuseppe Virgili scored the only goal of the game to give Fiorentina a 2‚Äì1 win on aggregate. In the quarter-finals against Grasshoppers of Switzerland, Fiorentina jumped out to a 3‚Äì0 lead early in the first leg thanks to goals from Armando Segato and Romano Taccola (2), but Robert Ballaman pulled one back for the visitors. Julinho extended Fiorentina's aggregate lead early in the second leg, only for Ballaman to again reduce the Swiss side's deficit; nevertheless, Miguel Montuori scored Fiorentina's fifth goal of the tie, rendering Branislav Vukosavljeviƒá's late goal mere consolation in a 5‚Äì3 aggregate scoreline. Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia were Fiorentina's opponents in the semi-finals. The first leg was played in Belgrade and went goalless until two minutes from the end, when Maurilio Prini scored for the Italians. The second leg went goalless, and Fiorentina won the tie to become the first Italian side to reach the European Cup final. Match The final was held at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium on 30 May 1957. Leo Horn of the Netherlands refereed the game. A penalty from Di St√©fano and a goal from Gento gave Madrid a 2‚Äì0 victory and retention of the title.

Petters will become the Provost at New York University Abu Dhabi effective September 1, 2020. Petters is a founder of mathematical astronomy, focusing on problems connected to the interplay of gravity and light and employing tools from astrophysics, cosmology, general relativity, high energy physics, differential geometry, singularities, and probability theory. His monograph \\"Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing\\" developed a mathematical theory of gravitational lensing. Petters was also the dean of academic affairs for Trinity College of Arts and Sciences and associate vice provost for undergraduate education at Duke University (2016-2019).  Biography  Petters was raised by his grandparents in the rural community of Dangriga, Belize (formerly Stann Creek Town, British Honduras). His mother immigrated to Brooklyn, New York, and married a U.S. citizen, with Arlie joining them when he was 14 years old.Claudia Dreifus. A CONVERSATION WITH: ARLIE PETTERS: A Journey to Bridge Math and the Cosmos, The New York Times, May 27, 2003. Petters earned a B.A./M.A. in Mathematics and Physics from Hunter College, CUNY in 1986 with a thesis on \\"The Mathematical Theory of General Relativity\\", and began his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Mathematics in the same year. After two years of doctoral studies, he became an exchange scholar in the Princeton University Department of Physics in absentia from MIT. Petters earned his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1991 under advisors Bertram Kostant (MIT) and David Spergel (Princeton University). He remained at MIT for two years as an instructor of pure mathematics (1991‚Äì1993) and then joined the faculty at Princeton University in the Department of Mathematics. He was an assistant professor at Princeton for five years (1993‚Äì1998) before moving to Duke University. Many media outlets have profiled Arlie Petters and his scholarship, including The New York Times, NOVA, The HistoryMakers (a digital archive of oral histories featuring African-Americans and preserved at the Library of Congress), Big Think,and Duke University's news outlet, The Chronicle.  Research  Petters is known for his work in the mathematical theory of gravitational lensing. Over the ten-year period from 1991 to 2001, Petters systematically developed a mathematical theory of weak-deflection gravitational lensing, beginning with his 1991 MIT Ph.D. thesis on \\"Singularities in Gravitational Microlensing\\". A. O. Petters, Ph.D. Thesis, MIT, Department of Mathematics (1991): \\"Singularities in Gravitational Microlensing.\\" In a series of papers, he and his collaborators resolved an array of theoretical problems in weak-deflection gravitational lensing covering image counting, fixed-point images, image magnification, image time delays, local geometry of caustics, global geometry of caustics, wavefronts, caustic surfaces, and caustic surfing. Section A, \\"Research Period 1991‚Äì2001,\\" Curriculum Vitae of Arlie O. Petters, Department of Mathematics, Duke University His work culminated in book, entitled Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing (Springer 2012), which he co-authored with Harold Levine and Joachim Wambganns. This book, which addressed the question, \\"What is the universe made of?\\", systematically created a framework of stability and genericity for k-plane gravitational lensing. The book drew upon powerful tools from the theory of singularities and put the subject of weak-deflection k-plane gravitational lensing on a rigorous and unified mathematical foundation. Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing, A. O. Petters, H. Levine, and J. Wambsganss (Birkhauser, Boston, 2001). Amazon.com Following his 1991‚Äì2001 body of mathematical lensing work, Petters turned to more astrophysical lensing issues from 2002 to 2005. In collaboration with astronomers, he applied some of the mathematical theory in [AP13] to help develop a practical diagnostic test for the presence of dark substructures in galaxies lensing quasars; \\"Identifying Lenses with Small-Scale Structure I. Cusp Lenses,\\" C. Keeton, S. Gaudi, and A. O. Petters, Astrophys. J., 598, 138 (2003); . \\"Identifying Lenses with Small-Scale Structure II. Fold Lenses,\\" C. Keeton, S. Gaudi, and A. O. Petters, Astrophys. J., 635, 35 (2005); . classify the local astrometric (centroid) and photometric curves of an extended source when it crosses fold and cusp caustics due to generic lenses;\\"Gravitational Microlensing Near Caustics I: Folds,\\" B. S. Gaudi and A. O. Petters, Astrophys. J., 574, 970 (2002); . \\"Gravitational Microlensing Near Caustics II: Cusps,\\" B. S. Gaudi and A. O. Petters, Astrophys. J., 580, 468 (2002); . predict the quantitative astrometric curve's shape produced by Galactic binary lenses. The classified local properties of the astrometric curves revealed a characteristic S-shape for fold crossings, parabolic and swallowtail features for cusp crossings, and a jump discontinuity for crossings over the fold arcs merging into a cusp. Petters, Levine, and Wambgamnns also developed a formula to calculate the size of the jump. During the period from 2005 to 2007, Petters collaborated with astronomers and physicists to explore gravitational lensing in directions beyond its traditional confines in astronomy. In a series of three mathematical physics papers published written with the astronomer Charles R. Keeton, he utilized higher-order gravitational lensing effects by compact bodies to test different theories of gravity with the general theory of relativity of Einstein among them. These papers computed beyond the standard weak-deflection limit the first- and second-order corrections to the image positions, magnifications, and time delays due to lensing in general relativity and alternative gravitational theories describable within the PPN formalism,\\"Formalism for Testing Theories of Gravity Using Lensing by Compact Objects. I. Static, Spherically Symmetric Case,\\" C. Keeton and A. O. Petters, Phys. Rev. D, 72, 104006 (2005); . and even determined lensing invariants for the PPN family of models. \\"Formalism for Testing Theories of Gravity Using Lensing by Compact Objects. II. Probing Post-Post-Newtonian Metrics,\\" C. Keeton and A. O. Petters, Phys. Rev. D 73, 044024 (2006); Their findings were applied to the Galactic black hole, binary pulsars, and gravitational microlensing scenarios to make testable predictions about lensed images and their time delays. Another paper took on the difficult issue of how to test hyperspace models like braneworld gravity that postulate an extra dimension to physical space. The paper developed a semi-classical wave theory of braneworld black hole lensing and used that theory along with braneworld cosmology to predict a testable signature of microscopic braneworld black holes on gamma-ray light. \\"Formalism for Testing Theories of Gravity Using Lensing by Compact Objects. III. Braneworld Gravity,\\" C. Keeton and A. O. Petters, Phys. Rev. D 73, 104032 (2006) \\"Scientist Predict How to Detect a Fourth Dimension,\\" Duke News Additionally, in a 2007 paper, Petters and M.C. Werner found a system of equations that can be applied to test the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis observationally using the realistic case of lensing by a Kerr black hole. \\"Magnification Relations for Kerr Lensing and Testing Cosmic Censorship,\\" M. C. Werner and A. O. Petters, Phys. Rev. D 76, 064024 (2007); Petters's previous work (1991‚Äì2007) dealt with non-random gravitational lensing. Starting in 2008, his research program focused on developing a mathematical theory of random (stochastic) gravitational lensing. In two papers, Petters, Rider, and Teguia took first steps in creating a mathematical theory of stochastic gravitational microlensing. They characterized to several asymptotic orders the probability densities of random time delay functions, lensing maps, and shear maps in stochastic microlensing and determined a Kac- Rice type formula for the global expected number of images due to a general stochastic lens system. \\"A Mathematical Theory of Stochastic Microlensing I. Random Time Delay Functions and Lensing Maps,\\" A. O. Petters, B. Rider, and A. M. Teguia, J.

Teguia (2008); astro-ph arXiv:0807.4984 The work forms a concrete framework from which extensions to more general random maps can be made. In two additional papers, he and Aazami found geometric universal magnification invariants of higher- order caustics occurring in lensing and caustics produced by generic general maps up to codimension five.\\"A Universal Magnification Theorem for Higher- Order Caustic Singularities,\\" A. B. Aazami and A. O. Petters, J. Math. Phys. 50, 032501 (2009); astro-ph arXiv:0811.3447v2 \\"A Universal Magnification Theorem II. Caustics up to Codimension Five,\\" A. B. Aazami and A. O.

Many Assyrians found themselves suddenly under Russian sovereignty and thousands of relatives crossed the border to join them. *The second wave was a result of the repression and violence during and after World War I. *The third wave came after World War II, when Moscow unsuccessfully tried to establish a satellite state in Iranian Kurdistan.

Again, many Assyrians found refuge in the Soviet Union, this time mainly in the cities. From 1937 to 1959, the Assyrian population in USSR grew by 587.3%. The Soviets in the thirties oppressed the Assyrians' religion and persecuted religious and other leaders. In recent years, the Assyrians have tended to assimilate, but their cultural and ethnic identity, strengthened through centuries of hardships, found new expression under Glasnost.  Current situation  According to the 2002 Russian census there were 14,000 Assyrians in Russia. 13,300 people (95% of all Assyrians) spoke Assyrian as native language.

A crowd of 20,287 was on hand at the Sydney Cricket Ground with the game officiated by Tom McMahon (the younger of the two pre-war referees of that name). The first half was a dour struggle for supremacy. Canterbury-Bankstown appeared to have the upper hand but Easts‚Äô Cairns scored first and it took two penalty goals by Canterbury‚Äôs Tommy Kirk to give the Berries a four points to three lead at half-time. The Roosters scored another try early in the second half when Dick Dunn dived over after the Easts backline had created an overlap. Again the conversion was missed. Canterbury-Bankstown came back at Easts with great determination and nearly scored on several occasions. Eventually Berries‚Äô reserve grader Jim Duncombe, who was in the team because of the illness of Aub Mitchell, was the first man to cross for the blue and whites. A scrum had gone down near Easts‚Äô line, Canterbury‚Äôs Roy McCarter worked a blind side move and Duncombe went through an opening to score. Kirk kicked the goal, and Canterbury-Bankstown led by nine points to six. The scores were close until about twenty minutes before the end, and then Canterbury made a final and determined rally. Easts' try line was attacked continuously. Joe Gartner, the Canterbury-Bankstown winger, went over for two excellent tries, beating the defence with side-stepping runs. Both were converted, the second by McCarter, the first by Kirk a fine effort from the sideline. Gartner's two tries put the issue beyond doubt, giving Canterbury a lead of 19 to 6. Canterbury‚Äôs excellent teamwork was the greatest factor in its success and the determined work of its forwards. They were opposed to an almost all-international Roosters pack with the experience of Ray Stehr and dangerous trygetters in Norval, Pearce, and Pierce. Canterbury's State hooker Roy Kirkaldy secured a good share of ball and with his front-row partners in Henry Porter and Eddie Burns continually stopped the Roosters attack, tackling themselves to a standstill. Nine seasons later in the 1947 Grand Final this Canterbury front three would still be dominating their opposition. The other Canterbury forwards in Sponberg, McCallum and McCormack also played tirelessly and deservedly chaired their captain Alan Brady from the field to enthusiastic cheers from the Canterbury fans celebrating their first premiership and to sporting congratulations from the Eastern Suburbs men. This was the first of five Grand Finals which the Bulldogs and Roosters have contested against each other, with subsequent Grand Finals between the two teams coming in 1940, 1974, 1980 and most recently, 2004. The Roosters would win in 1940 and 1974, but the Bulldogs would emerge victorious from their next two season-deciding encounters. Canterbury- Bankstown 19 (Tries: Gartner 2, Duncombe. Goals: Kirk 4, McCarter) defeated Eastern Suburbs 6 (Tries: Cairns, Dunn) References External links * Rugby League Tables - Notes AFL Tables * Rugby League Tables - Season 1938 AFL Tables * Premiership History and Statistics RL1908 * Sydney Morning Herald sept2004 SMH interview with Dick Dunn * Bulldogs Website Official History SMH Match Report * Results: 1931-40 at rabbitohs.com.au Category:New South Wales Rugby League premiership NSWRFL season ","title":"1938 NSWRFL season"},{"id":"12450209","text":"Utricularia nervosa is a terrestrial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia (family Lentibulariaceae).

The reduction from six classes to four (Triple-A, Double-AA, Class A, and Rookie) was a response to the general decline of the minors throughout the 1950s and early-1960s when leagues and teams folded due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans' preference for staying at home to watch MLB games on television.

This arrangement ended following the 1957 season when the relocation of the National League's Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast killed any chance of the PCL being promoted. The 1963 reorganization resulted in the Eastern and South Atlantic Leagues being elevated from Class A to Double-A, five of seven Class D circuits plus the ones in B and C upgraded to A, and the Appalachian League reclassified from D to Rookie. {  - ! style=\\";\\"Year ! style=\\";\\"Triple-A ! style=\\";\\"Double-A ! style=\\";\\"Class A ! style=\\";\\"Class B ! style=\\";\\"Class C ! style=\\";\\"Class D - ! 1962  Spokane Indians Omaha Dodgers  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  Greenville Spinners  Salem Dodgers  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Keokuk Dodgers/Midwest Dodgers Ozark Dodgers/Andalusia Dodgers St. Petersburg Saints - ! 1961  Spokane Indians Omaha Dodgers  Atlanta Crackers  Greenville Spinners  Salem Dodgers  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Artesia Dodgers Kokomo Dodgers Orlando Dodgers Panama City Fliers - ! 1960  Montreal Royals Spokane Indians St. Paul Saints  Atlanta Crackers  Macon Dodgers Green Bay Dodgers  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Kokomo Dodgers Odessa Dodgers Orlando Dodgers Panama City Fliers - ! 1959  Montreal Royals Spokane Indians St. Paul Saints  Victoria Rosebuds  Macon Dodgers Green Bay Bluejays  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Kokomo Dodgers Odessa Dodgers Orlando Dodgers Panama City Fliers - ! 1958  Montreal Royals Spokane Indians St. Paul Saints  Victoria Rosebuds  Macon Dodgers Pueblo Dodgers Green Bay Bluejays  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Columbus Foxes Kokomo Dodgers Thomasville Dodgers - ! 1957  Los Angeles Angels (open classification) Montreal Royals St. Paul Saints  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  Macon Dodgers Pueblo Dodgers  Cedar Rapids Raiders Victoria Rosebuds  Great Falls Electrics Reno Silver Sox  Bluefield Dodgers Kokomo Dodgers Shawnee Hawks Thomasville Dodgers - ! 1956  Portland Beavers (open classification) Montreal Royals St. Paul Saints  Ft.

Biography Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boylston spent her childhood there, and was nicknamed \\"Troub\\", short for Troubles. She attended Simmons College in Boston for a year. She thought of studying medicine like her father, but chose nursing since the training was shorter. She graduated as a nurse from Massachusetts General Hospital in 1915 and sailed for France to serve in the First World War with the Harvard Medical Unit, as part of the British Expeditionary Force. Massachusetts General Hospital She nursed the wounded at a front-line field hospital, specializing as a nurse anesthetist and reaching the rank of captain. Boylston wrote about her experiences in Sister: The War Diary of a Nurse, which was published in 1927. After the 1918 Armistice, Boylston remained in Europe working for the Red Cross for two years providing services to civilians in Albania, Poland, Russia, Italy, and Germany. Boylston met reporter Rose Wilder Lane, daughter of the not-yet- famous Laura Ingalls Wilder on a train between Paris and Warsaw. During periods in the United States, Boylston worked as the head of an outpatient department and as an instructor in anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, as well a psychiatric nurse in New York City and a head nurse in a Connecticut hospital, experiences she was to mine in future books. Between 1921 and 1924 she worked again with the Red Cross in Europe, and in 1925 wrote a reminiscence of her student nursing days that was published in the American Journal of Nursing. Boylston was still anxious for adventure and wrote to a friend \\"Daddy wants me to settle down, but I'm young! I'm young! Why shouldn't I live? What is old age if it has no memories except of 40 years or so of blank days?\\" In 1926 Lane and Boylston traveled to Europe with the goal of moving to Albania and earning their living by writing. In preparation, between March and September 1926 they lived in Paris, studying French, Italian, German and Russian at the Berlitz School. In August they purchased a maroon Model T Ford which they named \\"Zenobia\\" in honor of the Bedouin queen of ancient times, and set off to Albania with their French maid, Yvonne. An account of the journey, called Travels With Zenobia: Paris to Albania by Model T Ford was published in 1983. A Model T Ford Boylston lived in a comfortable house in Tirana, Albania for two years. The house she shared with Lane was the scene of numerous parties, where members of the Albanian government danced to the sound of their imported Victrola. According to her publisher, Boylston \\"once made the Albanian Prime Minister carry her trunk off the boat and tried to tip him, not knowing who he was.\\" She was also \\"shot at for two hours in a ditch in southern Albania, owing to a mistake in identity\\". While in Albania, Boylston assisted at an Albanian school of nursing that was directed by a fellow graduate from the School of Nursing at Massachusetts General Hospital. After about two years, Boylston saw a picture of a baked potato in a magazine, and feeling an \\"irresistible lure\\", returned to the US. A less dramatic version has her deciding to accompany Lane home after Lane had received a disturbing cablegram from her parents in January 1928. In the summer of 1928 Boylston arrived at Rocky Ridge, the Wilder family farmhouse in Mansfield, Missouri. Encouraged by the publication of her War Diary in book form, she decided to gain a living by writing, though she also supported in part by inherited income. She initially lived in a tent on a hill near the farmhouse, though the plan was that Boylston and Lane would live in the remodeled and modernized farmhouse, while Lane's parents, Laura Ingalls Wilder and Almanzo Wilder, moved into a newly built English stone cottage. Boylston lost considerable sums of investment income in the Depression and in the early 1930s moved east to work again as a nurse. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Boylston began writing and publishing stories more seriously. She published articles and stories in The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, and Argosy, and wrote a radio script for the Canadian Broadcasting Company. In 1936 Boylston published Sue Barton: Student Nurse, the first of her seven Sue Barton books. In publisher's note in a 1967 British edition of the book, Boylston stated that all the nursing incidents in the first two books were based on real events. The Kit, Connie and Bill characters were also based on real individuals and used their real names, while others used pseudonyms. She denied that Barton herself was an autobiographical portrait, saying \\"I made her up, lock, stock and barrel. She is the kind of person and the kind of nurse I wished I were, and I had a lot of fun creating her.\\" The books followed the career of a red-haired nurse as she progressed through her training, career, marriage and motherhood, and sought to maintain her independence. They were significant in providing role models to girls who wanted careers from the 1930s to 1950s, and in being among those that defined the young adult category of literature. The books were highly successful, selling millions of copies in English and translations, and were praised for their authentic representation of nursing practice and freedom from sentimentality. The books have been translated into several foreign languages, they remained in print ever since. With Sue Barton married to Bill Barry and expecting her first baby in Sue Barton: Superintendent Nurse, Boylston began a new series about another career woman, this time an actress, Carol Page. She incorporated the advice and experience of Eva Le Gallienne, her friend and neighbor, as well as researching her stories backstage at La Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City. Boylston later returned to Sue Barton, publishing the final two books in the series Sue Barton: Neighborhood Nurse and Sue Barton: Staff Nurse in 1949 and 1952 respectively. In 1955, Boylston published Clara Barton: Founder of the American Red Cross, a biography for young adults of Civil War nurse Clara Barton. Boylston never married. She suffered from dementia in later years, and died in Trumbull, Connecticut at the age of 89, leaving no known relatives.

It is found in tropical swamps and wetlands in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela; also Panama of Central America. Taxonomy Little rush warbler (Bradypterus baboecala), possibly one of the closest living relatives of the donacobius In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-capped donacobius in his Ornithologie based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name Le merle a test noire de Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Merula Atricapilla Capitis Bonae Spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-capped donacobius. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus atricapilla and cited Brisson's work. The type location was subsequently corrected to eastern Brazil. The specific name atricapilla is Latin for \\"black-haired\\" from ater \\"black\\" and capillus \\"hair of the head\\". This species is now placed in the genus Donacobius that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1831. The name of the genus is from Ancient Greek donakos \\"reed\\" and bios \\"mode of life\\". The black-capped donacobius is the only member of the genus Donacobius, but its familial placement has gone through several changes. In the 19th century, it was placed in the Turdidae, and in the 20th century, moved to the Mimidae. It had various English names, including the \\"black-capped mockingthrush\\". In the 1980s and 1990s, suggestions that it was a type of wren (Troglodytidae) were accepted by the South American Classification Committee (SACC), the American Ornithological Society (AOS) and most other authorities. Since at least 2018, the major taxonomic schemes place it in its own family, Donacobidae, and list it following the reed warblers of the family Acrocephalidae.Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M.

Habitat Black- capped donacobiuses are common in a wide range of Amazonian wetlands, including oxbow lakes, riparian zones, and other areas with tall dense aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. A third of the species range is outside the Amazon Basin, from Panama, northern Colombia, and western Venezuela, the Orinoco River system of Venezuela, to southeast coastal and inland Brazil, and neighboring countries southward, Paraguay, and extreme northern Argentina. Behavior Mating for life, pairs of black-capped donacobiuses can be seen frequently and throughout the day atop thickets of dense lakeside or streamside vegetation. They often will engage in antiphonic dueting. Adult offspring will remain with their parents and help raise siblings from subsequent nesting periods in a system of cooperative breeding.

It is endemic to Australia, where it occurs in mallee and heathland in the semi-arid southern parts of the continent, extending from Wyperfeld National Park in Victoria in the east through South Australia to the west coast between Kalbarri and the Pinnacles in Nambung National Park. It is a relatively dull and large robin, adults being around in length, of which around a third is the tail feathers. Most of the plumage is grey, except for a dullish red tail and patterned black-and-white wings. The legs are unusually long for a passerine, and are frequently used to hop through the dense heathland that forms the bird's habitat, where it searches for insects and other small invertebrates. Unusually for a passerine, the southern scrub robin lays only a single egg, which is grey-green in colour for camouflage amongst the sclerophyllous flora that forms its habitat. Each year between July and December, an egg is laid in a nest of twigs on the ground,Australian Robins: Petroicidae: Southern Scrub-Robin and which subsequently hatches after sixteen days.

When a place is vacated, it is redistributed within the national association by the following rules: * When the domestic cup winners (considered as the \\"highest- placed\\" qualifiers within the national association) also qualify for the Champions League, their UEFA Cup place is vacated, and the remaining UEFA Cup qualifiers are moved up one place, with the final place (with the earliest starting round) taken by the domestic cup runners-up, provided they do not already qualify for the Champions League or the UEFA Cup. Otherwise, this place is taken by the highest-placed league finishers that have not yet qualified for the European competitions. * When the domestic cup winners also qualify for the UEFA Cup through league position, their place through the league position is vacated, and the UEFA Cup qualifiers that finish lower in the league are moved up one place, with the final place taken by the highest- placed league finishers that have not yet qualified for the UEFA Cup. * A place vacated by the League Cup winners is taken by the highest-placed league finishers that have not yet qualified for the UEFA Cup. * A Fair Play place is taken by the highest-ranked team in the domestic Fair Play table that has not yet qualified for the Champions League or the UEFA Cup.

The first legs were played on 17 July 2008 and the second legs were played on 31 July 2008, with the exception of the Nordsj√¶lland vs TVMK match, which was played on 29 July 2008. - !colspan=\\"5\\"Southern-Mediterranean region - !colspan=\\"5\\"Central-East region - !colspan=\\"5\\"Northern region } In each region of the draw for the first qualifying round, teams were divided into two pots, on the basis of UEFA coefficients. The lower pots contained unranked teams from associations 34‚Äì53, together with Vƒótra of Lithuania (the 33rd association). The higher pots contained teams from associations 1‚Äì32, together with S≈´duva of Lithuania, and FH (who had a team ranking, 209). Three of the 37 ties were won by the lower ranked team, all involving teams whose ranking was that of their association: WIT Georgia (Georgia, ranked 38) beat Spartak Trnava (Slovakia, 24); Vllaznia (Albania, 43) beat Koper (Slovenia, 29); and St Patrick's Athletic (Ireland, 35) beat Olimps (Latvia, 31). Second qualifying round The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 1 August 2008 in Nyon, Switzerland, and featured 16 teams entering directly at the second qualifying round, as well as the 37 winners from the previous round and the 11 third round winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup. The first legs were played on 14 August 2008 and the second leg on 28 August 2008. Because there are an odd number of teams in the Central and Northern groups in the 2nd qualifying round, UEFA moved Rennes from the Central-East group to the Northern group. Furthermore, LiepƒÅjas Metalurgs and S≈´duva were moved from the Northern group to the Central-East group, and Vaslui and Interblock Ljubljana were moved from the Southern- Mediterranean group to the Central-East group. It is unknown why UEFA decided on these last moves since it is not strictly required. One of the reasons could be to have more balance in the groups with respect to the coefficients. - !colspan=\\"5\\"Southern-Mediterranean region - !colspan=\\"5\\"Central-East region - !colspan=\\"5\\"Northern region } In each region of the draw for the second qualifying round, teams were divided into two pots, on the basis of UEFA coefficients. The higher pots contained teams with a ranking of 176 or higher, and unranked teams from associations ranked 1 to 15 (or 17 in the Southern-Mediterranean region). 12 of the 32 ties were won by the lower-ranked team. The 12 teams that lost to a lower team were: AEK Athens, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Aris, Red Star Belgrade, Grasshopper, Slovan Liberec, Viking, Lokomotiv Sofia, Elfsborg, Gent, Queen of the South and Debrecen. St Patrick's Athletic were the only team to beat a higher-seeded team in each of the two qualifying rounds. First round The number of each teams from each nation which qualified for the First Round 32 teams entered the tournament at the first round, along with the 32 winners from the previous round and the 16 losers from the Champions League third qualifying round. The 80 teams were then split into eight groups of ten teams; five seeded teams and five unseeded teams. The draw was based on their coefficient ranking with one exception: no country can have multiple teams in any group. Teams ranked 108 or higher were seeded, as were unranked teams from England and Spain. The draw, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, was held on Friday, 29 August 2008 at 13:00 CET in Monaco. The matches were played on 18 September and 2 October 2008. - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 1 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 2 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 3 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 4 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 5 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 6 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 7 - !colspan=\\"5\\"Group 8 } Nine of the 40 ties were won by the unseeded team. The nine seeded losing teams, with their ranking, were: Everton (50), Rapid Bucure»ôti (58), Be≈üikta≈ü (60), Sparta Prague (68), Dinamo Bucure»ôti (69), Levski Sofia (80), Austria Wien (82), Rennes (97) and Hapoel Tel Aviv (108). Group stage The draw for the group stage of the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup was held at UEFA Headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, on 7 October 2008. The 40 teams in the draw were divided into five pots based on their UEFA coefficients. The eight teams with the highest UEFA coefficient were allocated to Pot 1, the next eight teams to Pot 2, and so on. One team from each pot was drawn for each group, with the restriction that no team could be drawn with one from the same country. The top three teams (highlighted in green) of each group qualified for the next round. Based on paragraph 6.06 in the UEFA regulations for the current season, if two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings: #superior goal difference from all group matches played; #higher number of goals scored; #higher number of goals scored away; #higher number of wins; #higher number of away wins; #higher number of coefficient points accumulated by the club in question, as well as its association, over the previous five seasons.

In the event of aggregate scores being equal after normal time in the second leg, the winning team will be that which scored more goals on their away leg: if the scores in the two matches were identical, extra time is played. The away goals rule also applies if scores are equal at the end of extra time. If there are no goals scored in extra time, the tie is decided on a penalty shoot-out. The team first out of the hat in each tie plays the first leg of their tie at home, and the second leg away. The draw for the Round of 32 was held on Friday, 19 December 2008 in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA's director of professional football and 2009 UEFA Cup Final ambassador Can Bartu. In this round, each UEFA Cup group winner paired with the third-placed team from another UEFA Cup group and each UEFA Cup group runner-up paired with a third- placed team from the UEFA Champions League, with the only restriction on the draw being that teams from the same national association could not be drawn together. The UEFA Cup group winners and runners-up each played the second leg of their Round of 32 ties at home. The draw for the Round of 16 also took place on 19 December 2008, immediately after the draw for the Round of 32. Each tie in the Round of 32 was numbered, and teams were drawn for the Round of 16 as \\"Winners of match 1\\", \\"Winners of match 2\\", etc. Unlike the Round of 32, teams from the same group or country may be drawn together from the Round of 16 onwards, meaning that they were entirely randomly drawn. The draws for the quarterfinals and semifinals were both held on Friday, 20 March 2009 in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was conducted by David Taylor and Can Bartu. Bracket Round of 32 The first legs were played on 18 February and 19 February, and the second leg matches were played on 26 February 2009. } Manchester City were the only team from the first qualifying round to reach the Round of 16. Braga were the only team from the Intertoto Cup to reach the Round of 16 and were therefore awarded the title of Intertoto Cup winners. Of the eight teams who had been placed in Pot 5 of the group stage draw, only Metalist Kharkiv and Saint-√âtienne reached the Round of 16. Of the eight teams that entered the Round of the 32 from the UEFA Champions League group stage, two lost: Fiorentina and Bordeaux. Of the eight ties between a third-placed team and a first-placed team from the UEFA Cup group stage, two were won by the third-placed team; the winners were Braga and Paris Saint-Germain. Round of 16 The first leg matches were played on 12 March, and the second leg matches were played on 18 March and 19 March 2009. } Quarter- finals The first legs were played on 9 April and the second legs were played on 16 April. } Semi-finals The first legs were played on 30 April and the second legs on 7 May. } Final The final of the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup was held on 20 May 2009 at the ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey. This was the first time that the UEFA Cup Final had been held in Turkey and followed the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, which was held in Istanbul's Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium.

The latter is sometimes known as the Xingu antbird, but this leads to confusion with Willisornis vidua. Range in Amazon South America The striated antbird has one large continuous range in the Amazon Basin's southwest as well as the south-central area in the countries of southeastern Peru, northwestern Bolivia and Brazil. The range is bifurcated in Bolivia, with the northwestern birds in the headwater river basins of the Madeira River of Brazil's Amazonas state, and the eastern Bolivian birds in the headwaters of the Guapor√© River, the Bolivian-Brazilian border river flowing westward into the Madeira. An extension of the western Bolivian range reaches southeastward into central Bolivia. A disjunct population of the striated antbird, is in a strip, 100 km wide by 400 km in northern Ecuador, and extreme southwestern Colombia. The southern tributary rivers to the Amazon that are in the species' range are the Madeira River and the Pur√∫s and Juru√° Rivers to the west.

It has fairly specific habita requirements, mostly being found in dense bamboo thickets and the thick understory of montane forest, and also more rarely in lowland evergreen forest, from . It measures between in length. The plumage varies by sex. The male has a white throat with black streaks, a black head with a white stripe above the eye and streaked cheeks, grey back and blackish wings, black tail, rufous flanks and belly, and a light rufous rump. The female is similar but with buff streaks in the crown, olive-grey back and duller and less streaked front. The ochre-rumped antbird feeds on insects and other arthropods, foraging in pairs or in family groups forage from ground level to up into the trees. They are active foragers, hopping forward and then pausing to scan for prey, frequently flicking their tail as they do so.Zimmer, K. & Isler, M.L. (2017). Ochre-rumped Antbird (Drymophila ochropyga).

P/Sgt. Grandstaff distinguished himself > while leading the Weapons Platoon, Company B, on a reconnaissance mission > near the Cambodian border. His platoon was advancing through intermittent > enemy contact when it was struck by heavy small arms and automatic weapons > fire from 3 sides surrounded by nearly 700 enemy forces.

Once a professional radio host, Carlin eventually took his show to the Internet, and he now hosts three popular independent podcasts: Hardcore History, Hardcore History: Addendum, and Common Sense. Background Carlin obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Colorado Boulder. He broke into the television news business in Los Angeles in the late 1980s and covered the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He has worked as a television news reporter, an author, a columnist, and a radio talk show host. No longer broadcasting on terrestrial radio, Carlin has achieved recognition in internet radio, podcasting, and the blogosphere. Carlin is the son of Academy Award nominated actress Lynn Carlin and film producer Ed Carlin. Carlin lives in Eugene, Oregon. He is a former reporter for KVAL-TV. Common Sense Common Sense began in 2005. Common Sense is similar in scope to several Carlin-hosted radio programs that aired between 1994 and 2004. He has described his political philosophy as \\"Neoprudentist\\", taking a skeptical approach to evaluation of the current political trends and forces. He fosters discussion by developing and presenting self-deprecating (\\"Martian\\") thought experiments on solutions to current problems. The podcasts are said to be broadcast \\"almost live from the end of runway two here at the Emerald International Airport.\\" Common Sense was nominated for a Podcast Award in the Politics/News category in 2012 and 2013. The podcast, as of 2016, was generating about 700,000 downloads per episode. Common Sense went through an almost two year hiatus beginning in May 2018 and ending on April 1, 2020, with episode 319 - \\"A Recipe for Caesar.\\" Hardcore History Hardcore History is Carlin's forum for exploring topics throughout world history. The focus of each episode varies widely from show to show but they are generally centered on specific historical events and are discussed in a \\"theater of the mind\\" style. New episodes are released approximately every four to seven months. Hardcore History, which has millions of downloads per episode, received over 350,000 downloads in a 24-hour period on May 6, 2015. It was nominated in 2012 for a Stitcher Award in the Best Educational & Learning Podcast category. In addition, Carlin has received the Best Classic Podcast in iTunes' Best of 2014 awards, Best Educational Podcast of 2015 from the Podcast Awards, Best History Podcast of 2018 from the IHeartRadio Podcast Awards, and in a top 25 best podcasts list in anniversary of 10 years of podcasts, Slate Magazine ranked Dan Carlin's 2009 episode Ghosts of the Ostfront, regarding the Eastern Front of World War Two, the fifth best podcast of all time.

Can anything halt the carnage? 1 hour 30 min September 23, 2012 - 46 Wrath of the Khans IV The death of Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, should have slowed the momentum of Mongol conquests, but instead it accelerated it. This time though, all of Europe is on the Mongol hit list. 1 hour 33 min November 13, 2012 - 47 Wrath of the Khans V Succession issues weaken the Mongol Empire as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan fight over their imperial inheritance.

The book aims to look at some of the apocalyptic moments from the past as a way to frame the challenges of the future.  War Remains  In 2019 Carlin developed a virtual reality experience in coordination with MWM Immersive and Skywalker Sound. The \\"Immersive Memory\\" is designed to put the viewer deeply into the experience of trench warfare along the Western Front of the First World War. War Remains premiered at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently shown in other venues around the United States. Political views Carlin has referred to himself as a constitutionalist, social libertarian, a \\"radical\\", \\"neo-prudentist\\", \\"pragmatist\\", and \\"political martian\\". He is outspoken on issues like state surveillance, foreign intervention, concentrated power, free speech, education reform, the problems of a two-party system, and civil liberties. Carlin stated he will vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential election, despite not voting for Democrats or Republicans since 1992. He considers Donald Trump dangerous given his authoritarian tendencies. Other podcast and media appearances Carlin has made guest appearances on numerous other podcasts, including Roifield Brown's \\"10 American Presidents Podcast\\" where he narrated the episode on Richard Nixon,http://www.10usp.com/dan-carlin/ Daniele Bolelli's The Drunken Taoist Podcast, and \\"History on Fire\\", making five appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast, two appearances on Smells Like Human Spirit and on a \\"crosscast\\" podcast on Sam Harris's ‚Äò‚ÄôMaking Sense‚Äô‚Äô (formerly Waking Up). In addition, Carlin has served as a panelist on CBS This Morning and was invited to speak at the TEDx Mt. Hood Conference on May 2, 2015. Carlin appeared on season 17 of Real Time with Bill Maher on October 25, 2019 as part of the panel while promoting his book The End Is Always Near. Carlin‚Äôs voice was featured as a podcast host in a 2019 episode of The Twilight Zone entitled ‚ÄúNightmare at 30,000 Feet‚Äù. Criticism Though often complimenting Carlin for his attempt to teach an \\"ill-informed citizenry\\" about history, some historians critique his approach as too simplistic. Carlin's typical response is that he is a \\"fan of History, not a historian\\" and focuses on popularizing history and trying to communicate very complex ideas as simply as possible. Carlin‚Äôs work has been noted by some as overcoming such shortcomings.

The six species of fairly uniform appearance and habits, are all native to various parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The name Dryoscopus is a compound Greek word: drus from the Greek word for \\"tree\\" and skopos, meaning \\"watcher or lookout\\". Structure and habits They are small, active bushshrikes that show a superficial resemblance to boubous. They however display only rudimentary duetting, have red or reddish irides, are smaller and compact with bouncy flight, and display sexual dimorphism. Characteristically, the long, loose and pale feathers of the male bird's back and rump are puffed out conspicuously during display. At the same time he may fly about, calling loudly. Comparable habits are found in some related genera (cf. Bocagia, Bias, Lanioturdus, Batis and Dyaphorophyia). Laniarius (top left) vs. Dryoscopus (below and right) They move about in pairs in the upper strata of trees (Pringle's excepting) and may join mixed-species flocks. They command a varied repertoire of explosive and fricative whistles, percussive clicking sounds, and harsh rasping, churring or tearing sounds. Three species have a rasping alarm call (cubla, senegalensis and pringlii), while the remaining three (gambensis, angolensis and sabini) have a stuttering alarm call. Wing fripping and bill snapping complement vocal communication. The nest is a neat compact cup in the general fashion of bushshrikes, but similar to those of shrike-flycatchers. Courtship feeding is present, and studied species are monogamous and single-brooded. Relationships DNA-DNA hybridization studies suggest that genus Tchagra is their closest relative, though biological traits also link them to Laniarius, shrike-flycatchers (i.e. Bias and Megabyas) and other genera. Species The genus contains the following six species: {  - ! Image !! Common Name !! Scientific name !!

They are common to fairly common sedentary bushshrikes in various wooded habitats in Africa south of the equator. They restlessly move about singly, in pairs or family groups, and generally frequent tree canopies. Like others of its genus, the males puff out the loose rump and lower back feathers in display, to assume a remarkable ball-like appearance. They draw attention to themselves by their varied repertoire of whistling, clicking and rasping sounds. Their specific name cubla, originated with Francois Levaillant, who derived it from a native southern African name, where the \\"c\\" is an onomatopoeic click sound. None of the other five puffback species occur in southern Africa. Description They measure about 17 cm in length, and the sexes are similar though easily distinguishable. Adult males have the upperparts deep blue-black with a slight luster. The black cap subtends the red eye, the upperpart plumage is black-and-white, and the underparts pure white. Females have a black loral stripe and white supraloral feathering, with the ear coverts pale and the crown not solidly black. They also have greyer backs than males, and grey to buffy tones to the white plumage tracts. Immature birds resemble females, but have brownish bills and brown irides, while the upperparts and flanks are still greyer, and the underparts and edges of the wing feathers are yet more buffy. Intraspecific variation is clinal. Range, iris colour, wing markings and the female plumage assist in separating it from other puffback species. Range and habitat They occur mainly south of the equator in sub-Saharan Africa, from southern Somalia to coastal South Africa. From the vicinity of the equator and northwards it is replaced by the somewhat larger northern puffback, with which it forms a superspecies. They are commonly found in gardens, riparian thickets, mangroves, woodlands, moist (or less commonly arid) savanna, bushveld and especially towards the south, fringes of afromontane forest. They are present from sea level to some 2,200 m.a.s.l., and are the only puffback species to occur over much of their range. Highest reporting rates are from the densest woodlands, though all woodland types, including Racosperma plantations, are utilized. In southern Africa the highest reporting rates are from miombo (including the Eastern Highlands), gusu, mopane, various mixed woodlands, whether moist or arid, and riparian fringing forest, including that of the Okavango Delta. A density of 1 pair per 42 ha was recorded in broadleaved Terminalia-Burkea woodland at Nylsvley, South Africa, and a breeding territory is thought to encompass some 4 ha. Intensive farming and human pressure have destroyed large tracts of their natural habitat in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. They are naturally absent from arid Acacia scrub, Acacia savanna on the Zimbabwean plateau, and the treeless highveld and alpine regions of southern Africa. It also avoids the Congo Basin and, for the most part, tree canopies at the interior of afromontane forests. Habits They usually occur in pairs and actively move about the higher strata of trees, sometimes in mixed-species flocks. Displaying males fly about and call loudly while puffing out the long and loose white feathers of the lower back. In his display flight the male may utter a chow-chow-chow-... call, besides a tik-weeu, tik-weeu, ... (also rendered: dzlit-toweeeyoo, or tzr-t'weeeyo). The male may also utter a click followed by an upslurred whiplash, to which the female may reply with a ssssshh ssssshh. Their food consists of large numbers of caterpillars, besides beetles, ants, termites and small fruit. It is considered sedentary where it occurs, as retraps do not exceed a 10 km radius. Species interactions They are preyed on by the African goshawk, and their nest contents fall prey to the grey-headed bushshrike. They may be killed by ants or come under attack by territorial boubou shrikes. They are parasitised by the black cuckoo and emerald cuckoo, besides perhaps klaas's cuckoo and the red-chested cuckoo. Breeding It is monogamous and single-brooded like other studied species of Dryoscopus. The nest is completed by the female in about 11 days, at which time she is accompanied by the male which regularly calls and displays. The nest is a neat, sharp-rimmed cup, which is constructed of strips of bark which are tied together, and to the supporting branches, with ample amounts of cobweb. It is usually placed in an upright fork in the canopy of a tree with matching smooth, grey bark. The female incubates for 13 to 14 days after she completed laying the clutch of two to three eggs at day intervals. The eggs are distinctly speckled, sometimes forming a ring around the blunter end. Both parents rear the chicks, which leave the nest after some 18 days. Breeding takes place during the summer months in southern Africa, but less predictably in the tropics. In southern Africa, breeding generally occurs earlier in the moist east (October‚ÄìDecember) than in the dryer west. In Zimbabwe it occurs mainly in spring (September‚ÄìNovember), but with records in most months, while the breeding peak in Transvaal is 1‚Äì2 months later (September‚ÄìJanuary). Races Male and female D. c. affinis, illustrated by Otto Finsch. This coastal race intergrades with D. c. hamatus in their contact zone. There are five accepted races. Races affinis and cubla seem to represent phenotypic extremes, while the remaining three represent intermediates. Distinction relies on physical proportions, whiteness of male plumage, female upperpart colours and presence of a loral spot, and the extent of white wing markings in either sex. D. c. chapini is subsumed in D. c. hamatus. * D. c. affinis (G.R.Gray, 1837) ‚Äì coastal Somalia to coastal Tanzania, including offshore islands :Description: Both sexes lack white edging to remiges and wing coverts.

The first Spanish contact with these people must have been in 1530 when Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino went through the Valley of Tlaltenango on a northbound expedition. The first land grantee of the area was Pedro Sernosa, who later sold his land to Juan Fern√°ndez de Jara Quemada. The town formed part of the jurisdiccion of Tlaltenango for both ecclesiastical purposes and governmental purposes until the beginning of the 1800s. In 1814, a plea was made by the citizenry that the community be granted its own town council and status as a municipality due to the long distance from the municipal seat and the ascending local population. The plea spells out that the town counted with nearly 700 \\"souls\\" and that within a radius of two leagues lived more than 3,700 people.

As a non-funded team, it is a member of the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association (WIRA), whose participants are mostly of non-Pac-10 schools on the West Coast. Nationwide, the team is one of the most successful collegiate rowing club programs in the United States, making periodic appearances in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association national championships, the Eastern College Athletic Conference and, more recently, the American Collegiate Rowing Association national championships. Notable alumni include Seth Weil (Class of 2011), who rowed in the USA men's coxless four at the 2016 Rio Olympics and who holds two world rowing championship first place titles in the men's four; as well as Carlo Facchino (Class of 1996) who holds a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest Pacific Ocean crossing from Monterey, CA to Honolulu, Hawaii with a time of 39 days, 9 hours and 56 minutes. History Founded in 1977, the Davis Men's Crew Club was established under the guidance of Rich Sundquist, a former oarsman from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1980 the crew received its first own racing shell, a wooden sweep eight, which was cut in half and driven from the East Coast on top of a van. In 1993 the crew completed the Curt Rocca Boathouse, which was to replace a smaller boathouse built earlier on. The boathouse is still used today, shared with the UC Davis women's rowing team and located in the Port of Sacramento. Organization As a registered student organization of the university, the team's operations and administrative decisions are managed by its student membership in cooperation with the UC Davis Intramural Sports and Sports Club Office. Council club officers vote on a variety of decisions, from hiring coaches to managing team finances. As a club sport at UC Davis, the program receives minimal funding for a crew team. The majority of the club's income comes from membership dues, fundraising, and alumni donations. Most rowers and coxswains are walk-ons, with little to no previous experience in the sport of rowing. In the Fall returning crew members recruit students on campus, headed by two elected club recruiters. Those interested can attend practices run by the novice coach, who trains those new to the sport. Besides the recruiters, there are many club officers that help run the program as a whole. Those within the council vote on important key issues for the team. Overall, club officers coordinate their individual responsibilities to one another to ensure all aspects of the program are running smoothly. Officer positions are voted on in an election amongst teammates at the end of each school year. Club Officer Positions *Executive Council **President **Vice-President **Secretary **Treasurer **Fundraiser *Regular Council Members **Haberdasher **Historian **Recruiters **Boathouse Manager **Website Manager **Safety Representative Team Tradition Since the club represents UC Davis, the team colors are blue and gold. The official logo insignia of the crew, seen on official racing uniforms and on the face of the oar blades, is an Aggie blue UCD written on white background. Often the Cal Aggie symbol is used as well with oars crossing behind it. The official mantra of the crew is 'RYBO', an acronym for 'Row your balls off'. To avoid confrontation, members can amend it to a more family-oriented saying, such as 'Row your buns off'. RYBO is found on many of the official crew apparel, and is often included in team cheers, most commonly when a team boat launches for a race.

Rivalry WIRA 2007 Regionally, the club's rival is the Sacramento State Hornets. However, the club considers Orange Coast College, Gonzaga, and UC San Diego to be rivals as well, especially since these schools are members of WIRA. In the varsity eight grand final at the 2007 WIRA championship regatta, Davis finished first at 6:03.8, barely ahead of Gonzaga's 6:04.3 and UC San Diego's 6:05.7. WIRA Events Won, by Year {  - !

She was reported to be the oldest living person in the United States when she died, supposedly at the age of 120. It is said she traveled to the Oregon Territory across the Oregon Trail at the age of 66. There is evidence this age claim was inaccurate or exaggerated, however, and she may have been between 96 and 98 when she died.  Biography  This section is based mainly on two 1908 obituaries for Mary Ramsey Wood and a 1906 story on the occasion of her birthday. These sources were likely mistaken about her being born in 1787, as described below, thus, many of the age- related facts may be inaccurate. According to obituaries published in 1908, Mary Ramsey was born on May 20, 1787 on a farm near Knoxville, Tennessee. The child of brickmaker Richard Ramsey and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Gann), Mary Ramsey grew up in Tennessee. Her parents were born in England and immigrated to North America after they were married. In the American Colonies, they settled in Tennessee and raised ten children. Mary was the sixth child. Ramsey's mother was reported to have lived to the age of 110, and her father had died just a few years before his wife. Richard Ramsey built the first brick home in Knoxville, and the family was wealthy and owned slaves. In her early years Mary Ramsey danced with General Andrew Jackson, for whom her father fought in the War of 1812. At the age of 12, Ramsey joined the Methodist church, and in 1804 she married Jacob Lemons in Tennessee. The couple would raise four children on their farm in that state. The children were Mary Jane Lemons (1806‚Äì1904), Isaac Lemons (1809‚Äì1866), Nancy Ellen Lemons Bullock (1816‚Äì1868), and Catherine Bridgette Lemons Southworth Smith Reynolds (1830‚Äì1909). In 1837, the family moved to Alabama followed by Georgia the next year. In 1839, Jacob died, and in 1849 Mary Lemons moved to Missouri. Lemons moved to the Oregon Territory with her daughters Nancy and Catherine and their families in 1852. The family brought 12 slaves with them to Oregon. Wood rode her horse Martha Washington Pioneer the entire journey along the Oregon Trail at the age of 66, and as a midwife she delivered at least one baby during the trip. The family arrived in Oregon in 1853, and settled in Washington County at Hillsboro in the Tualatin Valley. She married John Wood on May 28, 1854, in Hillsboro. He built the first frame hotel in Hillsboro, the Commercial Hotel, in which Mary tended bar at the in-house saloon. Around 1865, the couple sold the hotel to Mary's daughter Catherine. John Wood died in 1867. Mary Wood then served as postmaster of Hillsboro before retiring to her daughter's residence. In 1879, she suffered from typhoid fever and lost the sight in her left eye. In 1904, she testified in a trial concerning a 40-year-old land deed, where she was noted for having a \\"keen\\" memory. In 1907, Wood was crowned as the first \\"Mother Queen\\" of Oregon by former Oregon Senator George Henry Williams and the president of the Oregon Pioneer Association, Joseph D. Lee.Note: Women later nominated \\"Mother Queen\\" included Otelia Cullen Polk DeWitt and Nancy Kincaid Henry L. Pittock presided over the ceremony on July 4, 1907, at which Wood was represented by a large photograph by Frederick H. Kiser due to her frailty; the story was reported nationally. Wood's gravestone According to obituaries of the time, \\"Grandma\\" Mary Ramsey Wood died at the age of 120 on January 1, 1908, at five o'clock in the morning. At the time of her death she was thought to be the oldest living person in the United States. She was also referred to as the \\"oldest Methodist in the world\\". Wood was buried at the Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery. Her death and her supposed age were widely reported across the country at the time. A 1908 Oregonian story, which claimed her age was authentic, stated that Wood's daughter had written to relatives in Missouri for a record of the family Bible. The reply, which the Oregonian claims was viewed by their reporter, excerpted the bible record that showed Wood's age would have been 120 the previous May. The letter, however, was lost and the relatives moved, making it \\"impossible\\" to contact the letter writer again. At the time of Wood's death, George Putnam, editor of the Capital Journal, republished a 1905 interview with Wood conducted when he worked for The Oregon Journal. He believed that she may have been the oldest woman in the world. Longevity claim Although both historic and contemporary sources repeat the claim that Wood was 120 years old at the time of her death, according to United States Census records and modern longevity research, this longevity claim is highly likely to be false. If Mary Ramsey Wood had lived to be 120, as claimed, she would have been the world's oldest person at that time, and would be the oldest American on record even today. That distinction, however, according to Guinness World Records, belongs to Sarah Knauss, who died at age 119. Census data In addition to the longevity records, census data may show a discrepancy between Mary Wood's claimed age at death and her actual age. Three U.S. census records for Hillsboro list a Mary Wood with data that match parts of Mary Ramsey Wood's biography. The 1860 Census lists a Mary Wood, aged 50, and a John Wood, aged 71, living in Hillsboro, alongside Charles and Nancy Bullock, aged 38 and 27 respectively. John's occupation is \\"landlord\\". There is a Mary Wood listed in the 1880 Census for Hillsboro, with a stated age of 69. The Mary Wood listed in the census data was born in Tennessee and lived with her daughter, Catherine Smith. Her parents were from England. The 1900 Census lists a Mary Wood with a birthdate of May 1809 (age 91) living with her daughter Catherine Reynolds, whose birthdate was October 1832 (age 67), in Hillsboro. The Mary Wood in the 1900 census was born in Tennessee with parents born in England. Although Mary Ramsey Wood was called a \\"great reader\\", the Mary Wood in the 1900 census could not read or write. If the Mary Wood listed in the 1860, 1880, and 1900 censuses is the same person as Mary Ramsey Wood, then, owing to a slight discrepancy in the stated ages, she would have been between 96 and 98 years old at the time of her death. Legacy Wood's hotel, at the northwest corner of 2nd and Washington streets, burned down in 1912. Today the HART Theatre is located on the site. The nearby Hillsboro Civic Center has an informational plaque in its plaza about Wood. In 2005, it was proposed that a fountain at the civic center be named for Wood. January 1, 2008 was named Mary Ramsey Wood Day by the City of Hillsboro. Local historian James Andrew Long advocated for this recognition of Wood. Modern news stories about Wood, published as recently as 2014, mention that there is some dispute about her age at death but continue to state her age of 120 years at her death as fact.

B1) is a German federal highway running in an east- west direction from the Dutch border near Aachen to the Polish border at K√ºstrin-Kietz on the Oder River. History The road developed from an ancient east-western trade route connecting the shore of the North Sea at Bruges with the area of Novgorod. A trade and military road was already mentioned in Ptolemy's Geography about 150 AD, parts of it formed the medieval Westphalian Hellweg trade route, vital for the transport of salt and crops, and the course of the Via Regia, the Ottonian \\"royal road\\" through the Holy Roman Empire from Aachen to Magdeburg. From the late 18th century onwards, parts of the route were rebuilt as a chaussee, mainly in the area between Aachen and J√ºlich as well as on the nearby territory of the County of Mark, promoted by the Brandenburg-Prussian administration under Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein. Stein also concluded an agreement to extend the road via the territory of Imperial Essen Abbey for the accessibility of the coal deposits in Cleves. The road from the Prussian capital Berlin to the royal castles in Potsdam was rebuilt in 1792 and extended to Brandenburg an der Havel until 1799. After Napoleonic Wars and the Empire's dissolution in 1806, the Prussian monarchs systematically expanded the road network, completing the chaussee between Berlin and Magdeburg in 1824, and between Berlin and K√∂nigsberg in 1828, reaching the East Prussian terminus at Gumbinnen (present- day Gusev, Russia) in 1835. In 1932 the major highways of the German Reich were numbered and two years later the Fernverkehrsstra√üe 1 was incorporated into the Reichsstra√üen system. After 1945 the former Reichstra√üe 1 was split into Bundesstra√üe 1 in West Germany and Fernverkehrsstra√üe 1 in East Germany until 1990. The part east of the Oder became part of different polish Droga krajowa. Route description The road's western terminus is in Aachen, where it connects with the N278 in the Netherlands. The road heads eastward through the Ruhr Area in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. Here it is identical with A 40. Leaving the Ruhr Area east of Dortmund, the B1 travels the more scenic route that shadows the A 2. Here it follows the old trading route Hellweg, crossing cities like Unna, Werl, Soest, Paderborn, Hamelin, Hildesheim and Brunswick. It then continues to Magdeburg, Potsdam and Berlin. The road reaches Berlin's city limits at Glienicke Bridge and heads towards the inner city via Potsdamer Platz, Leipziger Platz and Leipziger Stra√üe to Alexanderplatz. It leaves Berlin to the eastern side via Karl-Marx-Allee, Frankfurter Tor and Frankfurter Allee, joined by the Bundesstra√üe 5 for around 20 km up to M√ºncheberg, before reaching the Polish border. The road's eastern terminus in K√ºstrin-Kietz is with Polish national road DK22 which crosses the country in an easterly direction.

It has several subspecies breeding across southern and western parts of South America. Southern birds migrate north in winter. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest. Description The white-crested elaenia easily is recognizable as an elaenia by the combination of drab plumage (primarily dull green above, and whitish below); wings with conspicuous wing bars (pale tips to the greater and median wing coverts); slightly crested appearance, with a semi-concealed white center to the crown; and upright posture. small-billed elaenia, lesser elaenia and sierran elaenia cannot always be distinguished in the field. The length of the species ranges from and weight is , with an average of .  Subspecies  At least five subspecies are recognized:IOC Bird List v.6.3 * E. a. griseigularis - Sclater, PL, 1859: found from southwestern Colombia to northwestern Peru * E. a. diversa - Zimmer, JT, 1941: found in north-central Peru * E. a. urubambae - Zimmer, JT, 1941: found in southeastern Peru * E. a. albiceps - (D'Orbigny & Lafresnaye, 1837): found in extreme southeastern Peru and northwestern Bolivia * E. a. modesta - Tschudi, 1844: found in western Peru and northwestern Chile. This subspecies has distinctly different vocals and may potentially be re-classified as a separate species, the Peruvian elaenia.Jaramillo, A., 2003 * A sixth subspecies, E. a. chilensis - Hellmayr, 1927, found in Bolivia, Argentina and Chile is further recognized by some authorities as a separate species, the Chilean elaenia. Distribution and habitat The white-crested elaenia is a permanent resident in the central and southwestern coastal Andean region of South America in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and northernmost Chile. Also, in most of Argentina, mostly western, and southern and central Chile, Tierra del Fuego, it is also resident. To the north and east in northeast Brazil, the Amazon Basin, and in the Amazonian Andes regions of eastern Colombia, Peru, and northern Bolivia southeastwards into eastern Brazil, white-crested elaenia is a non-breeding resident bird, in the austral winter. In the entirety of South America, two thirds of its range is as a non-breeding migratory species. It is a vagrant to the Falkland Islands and in 2008 a bird was found in Texas, a potential first for the United States and North America. A second bird was reported in Chicago in 2012. Like many other species of Elaenia, white-crested elaenia is found in a variety of wooded habitats. Throughout most of its breeding distribution in the Andes, white-crested elaenia is found at forest edge, in second growth, and in scrub. In at least some areas, it breeds in drier intermontane valleys, rather than the more humid forests occupied by Sierran elaenia, but the habitat relationships between the two species have not been studied in detail. In northwestern Argentina, where white-crested elaenia overlaps with small- billed elaenia, there is some degree of segregation by habitat: small-billed elaenia breeds in tall woods, and primarily below , whereas white-crested elaenia occurs in smaller trees and in agricultural areas, at elevations from . Behavior and ecology It regularly consumes small fruit, at least when not breeding, but takes small insects as well. It also eats a large variety of foods such as grass, berries, seeds, and nuts. The white-crested elaenia typically is solitary, but, at least when not breeding, may congregate with other frugivores at fruiting trees. Aggregations of up to 100 individuals have been reported during migration. The oldest known white-crested elaenia from banding studies was eight years and two months old, though it is uncertain whether this represents the maximum potential longevity of the species.Jim√©nez, Jaime and Rozzi, Ricardo ‚Äò¬øCuanto Viven las Aves des Bosque m√°s Australia del Planeta?‚Äô; UNAB y la Uni√≥n de Ornit√≥logos realizan X Congreso de Ornitolog√≠a References External links * White-crested Elaenia videos on the Internet Bird Collection * White-crested Elaenia photo gallery VIREO * Photo-Medium Res; Article & Synopsis avesdechile white-crested elaenia Category:Birds of the Andes Category:Birds of Ecuador Category:Birds of Peru Category:Birds of Chile Category:Birds of Tierra del Fuego white- crested elaenia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Fr√©d√©ric de Lafresnaye Category:Taxa named by Alcide d'Orbigny ","title":"White-crested elaenia"},{"id":"12450636","text":"The lesser elaenia (Elaenia chiriquensis) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers.

Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Caribbean elaenia in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Martinique. He used the French name Le gobe-mouche hup√© de la Martinique and the Latin Muscicapa Martinicana cristata. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Caribbean elaenia. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Muscicapa martinica and cited Brisson's work. This species is now placed in the genus Elaenia that was introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1836.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task in combat areas, she was awarded four battle stars during World War II, four during the Korean War, and six campaign stars during the Vietnam War. Taluga was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 728) on 23 December 1943 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 10 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Harvey Klemmer; delivered to the Navy at Norfolk, Virginia, on 25 August 1944; and commissioned there on that same day, Comdr. Hans M. Mikkelsen in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  The oiler left Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 October; stopped at Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, from the 9th to the 11th; and transited the Panama Canal on the night of 13 and 14 October. She reached Pearl Harbor on the 26th and, two days later, continued on to the Marshalls. The oiler entered the Eniwetok lagoon on 26 November and exited on the 28th. On 10 December, she reached Ulithi, which served as her base of operations until the end of World War II. For the next 11 months, Taluga was in and out of Ulithi picking up oil and other supplies there and carrying them to units of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. For the most part, her oil and aviation gasoline went to the ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force.  Supporting Allied landings  During that time, she supported the carrier strikes and landings on Luzon, the Okinawa landings, the strikes on Formosa, and the final 3rd Fleet sweep of the Japanese home islands in the summer of 1945. Between April and July 1945, she spent much of her time in and around the anchorage at Kerama Retto, just west of the southern end of Okinawa. There, on 16 April, she encountered her greatest excitement of the war.  Under attack by kamikaze planes  Shortly after dawn, ten kamikazes attacked her formation. One of them dove at the oiler, strafed her deck, and then made for her superstructure. The attacker careened off the ship's bridge and exploded through her forward well deck into a compartment adjacent to her tanks brimming with 300,000 gallons of aviation fuel. However, only 12 men were injured; and the oiler was soon back in action.  End-of-war activity  Soon after the final 3rd Fleet sweep of Hokkaid≈ç and Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan capitulated. Taluga, entered Tokyo Bay on 26 August, 11 days following the cessation of hostilities, and took up duty as station oiler until early October. She then voyaged to Ulithi once more to refill her tanks and returned to Japan for duty as station oiler at Yokosuka. On 18 November, she departed that port to support ships engaged in the occupation of China and Korea. She visited Tsingtao and Jinsen before returning to Yokosuka, Japan, on 6 December. On 31 January 1946, the oiler put to sea to return to the United States. She arrived in San Pedro, California, on 16 February and commenced a four-month yard period.  East coast operations  Following overhaul, she sailed from San Pedro on 15 June for the Far East. For the next year, Taluga hauled oil from the Persian Gulf ports of Bahrain and Ras Tanura to American bases in Japan and the Philippines. On 13 June 1947, she got underway from Yokosuka, Japan, bound for home by the westward route. During that cruise, the oiler visited Singapore and Bahrain before transiting the Suez Canal and stopping at Tangier. On 10 August, she entered port at Norfolk. Three weeks later, the oiler was back at sea and - after an overnight stop at Key West, Florida - headed for the Mediterranean. She loaded oil at Bahrain from 30 September until 2 October and, following visits to Suez and Tangier, returned to Norfolk on 28 October. On 4 November, she departed Hampton Roads once more for a cruise to the Middle East. She stopped at Ras Tanura from 30 November to 5 December; then she continued eastward across the Indian Ocean and up through the South China Sea to Yokosuka, Japan, arriving there on the day after Christmas. On the last day of 1947, Taluga departed Yokosuka and set a course across the Pacific to Puget Sound, Washington. She reached her destination on 13 January 1948 and began overhaul at the naval shipyard.  Diversity of operations  Taluga completed overhaul and departed Puget Sound on 19 April. For the next three years, the oiler plied the oceans carrying oil to various American bases the world over. During that period, she made short runs between ports on both coasts as well as long voyages to ports overseas. She served with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on occasion and stopped frequently at the Persian Gulf ports, Ras Tanura and Bahrain. The oiler called most frequently at San Diego, San Pedro, Long Beach, and Seattle, Washington, on the U.S. West Coast; Norfolk on the east coast; as well as Galveston, Texas, Houston, Texas, Crist√≥bal, Panama, Guant√°namo Bay, and Aruba in the gulf and West Indies areas. On 12 May 1951, Taluga departed San Francisco and, during the next month and one-half, made two voyages between California and Alaska. On the first, she made a circuit from Adak to Dutch Harbor to Kodiak before returning to San Francisco on 31 May. The second Alaskan voyage took her to Adak and Kodiak and was completed on 3 July. During the following months, she shuttled between California ports before departing the west coast for the Far East on 30 July.  Korean War operations  While Taluga was shuttling oil to bases throughout the world, trouble was brewing in the Far East. On the morning of 25 June 1950, the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea. American and other UN troops pushed the North Koreans back as far as the Yalu River; and, by winter, the war appeared to be all but over. However, the renewal of the war by the injection of communist Chinese troops required the United States to increase its flow of men and material to strengthen the sagging defenses. By the summer of 1951, Taluga was on her way again to join in another Asian war. She departed Long Beach late in July; stopped at Midway Island and Kwajalein; and reached Sasebo, Japan, on 23 August. The oiler remained there for a month, then headed for the combat zone on 22 September. Operating from Sasebo at the southwestern tip of Ky≈´sh≈´, Taluga supported the blockade and siege of Wonsan and Songj in almost until the end of hostilities. She ranged up and down the eastern coast of Korea supplying oil and aviation fuel to the warships conducting operations along the coast. From March to September 1952, she returned to the west coast and conducted operations between San Diego and Long Beach. She returned to Korean waters in October and, after almost three months of operations in support of UN naval forces, moved south to Taiwan where she visited Keelung and Kaohsiung and supported the Taiwan Strait Patrol.  Peacetime deployment  In April 1953, Taluga sailed from Yokosuka, Japan, via Pearl Harbor, and arrived in San Pedro, California, early in May. She operated along the west coast, visiting San Diego and Long Beach, until mid-August. On the 17th, she got underway from Long Beach on the first peacetime deployment with the 7th Fleet in a series which lasted until the escalation of the Vietnam War brought the return of a substantial American presence back to the Asian continent.  Tachen Islands evacuation support  Interspersed among the routine operations of those deployments were several operations of note ‚Äî ones which might have presaged the increasing American involvement in Southeast Asia. During the winter of 1954 and 1955, the oiler participated in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalists from the Tachen Islands located just off the mainland. In January 1955, she took station off Henriette Passe, near Haiphong, to fuel the transport and relief supply ships evacuating refugees from strife-torn North Vietnam during the latter stages of Operation Passage to Freedom, instituted in the wake of the Geneva agreements which followed the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu.  Vietnam operations  Soon thereafter, Taluga resumed a series of deployments with the 7th Fleet for another 10 years. In 1965, the United States began expanding its direct participation in the Vietnam War. Taluga's remaining deployments, therefore, were wartime deployments in or near a combat zone. During the ensuing six years, Taluga deployed to the western Pacific six times. On each occasion, she saw service in the war zone along the Vietnamese coast replenishing units of the 7th Fleet operating off the coast. She fueled the larger units as they supported the large carriers conducting strikes inland, and she offered support to the smaller units engaged in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of North Vietnamese coastal logistics and infiltration. Only once did she depart from her schedule of western Pacific deployments alternated with west coast operations and yard overhauls. That occasion came at the end of her 1970 deployment when she sailed south of the equator to Australia and New Zealand, where she joined in LONGEX-70, the New Zealand annual maritime exercise.  Converted to MSTS experimental use  Taluga completed her final deployment as a commissioned Navy ship at Long Beach on 13 November 1971. She conducted operations along the coast for another six months. On 4 May 1972, the oiler was decommissioned and turned over to the Military Sealift Command to participate in a pilot program designed to test the feasibility of reducing the number of Navy men serving in oilers. The operation, named Operation Charger Log II, was an unqualified success. For the next three and one-half years, her crew ‚Äî made up of 105 civilians and 16 military men ‚Äî maneuvered her through 875 underway replenishments in support of the 7th Fleet in the Far East. In late February 1976, she cleared the western Pacific for Oakland, California, where she was placed in a ready-reserve status incident to overhaul. USNS Taluga completed overhaul in October 1976 and was then reactivated as a fleet support ship assigned to the 3rd Fleet in the eastern Pacific. She served in that capacity into October 1979.  Final decommissioning  She was placed out of service (date unknown). She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, 21 February 1992, and transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. Her title was transferred to MARAD on 1 May 1999. On 1 July 2010, the ship was moved from the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet to the BAE Systems' shipyard in San Francisco where she was drydocked for cleaning prior to an ocean tow through the Panama Canal to Brownsville, Texas for scrapping.http://maritimematters.com/2010/07/times-up-for-the-taluga/  Awards  Taluga earned four battle stars during World War II: * Leyte operation * Luzon operation * Okinawa Gunto operation * 3rd Fleet operations against Japan During the Korean War: * UN Summer-Fall Offensive * Second Korean Winter * Korean Defense Summer-Fall 1952 * Third Korean Winter During Vietnam: * Vietnam Defense * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 * Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970 * Sanctuary Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VII * Consolidation I  References  *  External links  * Category:Cimarron- class oilers (1939) Category:Ships built in Sparrows Point, Maryland Category:1944 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:World War II tankers of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Cold War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Taluga (AO-62)"},{"id":"12450746","text":"Photographed at Bwindi, SW Uganda The white-tailed blue flycatcher (Elminia albicauda) is a species of bird in the family Stenostiridae.

It is found from 600 m to 1900 m in Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains, and up to 2700 m elsewhere. Where its range overlaps with the closely related white-bellied crested flycatcher this species is found at higher altitudes and not below 2250 m, where its relative it is absent it ranges as low as 1200 m. The diet of this species is not well studied, although like most flycatchers it feeds on invertebrates including flies, ants, moths and spiders. They travel in pairs or small family groups, sometimes joining mixed-species feeding flocks. During the breeding season pairs are territorial. They are monogamous, at the start of the season the male displays to the female using its tail and feeds the female. Two eggs are laid in a small nest in the fork of a branch, usually 2 m high in a tree, but up to 6 m. There is a division of labour between the pair, with the female undertaking all the incubation and the male feeding the chicks once they hatch. Chicks fledge after 15 days.

Description The African blue flycatcher is a dainty, pale, bright blue flycatcher with a short crest and long tail. The entire upper parts and tail are bright blue, shading between blue and cyan, with black lores and black flight feathers edged with blue, the underparts are greyish blue fading to whitish on the belly. The bill and legs are black. Juveniles are duller with faint greyish spotting on the head and wing coverts. It measures 15‚Äì18 cm in length and weighs 7‚Äì12g. Voice The song of the African blue flycatcher is a series of slow, rather random and tuneless sibilant notes strung together in no particular order. Call is a quiet \\"tsip\\". Distribution The African blue flycatcher occurs from Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia east discontinuously to Kenya and south through the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to northern Angola. Habitat Its natural habitats are moist lowland forests, mangrove forests, gallery forest, montane forests, gardens, wooded farmland and moist savanna. Habits Forages rather gracefully with fanned tail and half open wings among leaves, as well as occasionally foraging on the ground and flycatching. Taxonomy The African blue flycatcher is thought to form a superspecies with the white-tailed blue flycatcher and these species ; the two have been placed in a separate genus Errannornis, but the differences between this species pair and the other species classified in Elminia are considered insufficient to merit generic separation. Two subspecies of the African blue flycatcher are currently recognised. Elminia longicauda longicauda (Swainson, 1838) which is found in the western part of its range as far east as Nigeria, and the paler Elminia longicauda teresita Antinori, 1864 in the west and the south.

Sonnet 110 was published along with the other sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. The sonnet falls in place with the Fair Youth sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The mystery of the young man is still unknown today. However, there are many different theories by various scholars of who this young man may be. There has been much debate whether or not this sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and actors. Whereas others have interpreted sonnet 110 as the poet confessing his love to a young man. The sonnet is a confession of the poets committed sins and promiscuity, which quickly escalates to his confession of love to the young man. With Shakespeare's heavy use of double meanings to words have scholars perplexed as to whether the sonnet is about Shakespeare's career as an actor or a confession of love to the young man. The sonnet is written in traditional Shakespearean sonnet form consisting of 14 lines with Iambic Pentameter and ending with a couplet. Paraphrase The poet confesses to profligate and dishonest behaviour, but these faults have revitalised him. He will no longer look elsewhere but devote himself to the young man, who he hopes will welcome him back. Below is scholar David West's paraphrase translated to modern English: It's true. I have ranged widely, made myself a fool, squandered my treasure, and hurt my old lover by taking a new. I have truly given truth a sideways glance, but I swear this brought youth back to my heart. Experiment proved that you are the best that love has to offer. It is ended. Take what will not end. Never again will I whet my appetite on new loves to test the old, my one and only god of love. You are next to my heaven. Take me back to your pure and loving breast. Structure Sonnet 110 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 7th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / These blenches gave my heart another youth, (110.7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Lines 3 and 14 have initial reversals, and the 9th line has a mid-line reversal (\\"have what\\"): √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / Now all is done, have what shall have no end: (110.9) The meter demands that line 13's \\"heaven\\" and line 14's \\"even\\" each function as one syllable.  Context  Although the sonnets were published in 1609, the exact date of when they were written is unclear. It is estimated that the sonnets could have been written between 1588 and 1593. The sonnets are written about two characters in particular: the Dark Lady and an unknown young man. Scholar Kenneth Muir states that the first 126 sonnets were written about a man and the others were written about the Dark Lady. The identity of the young man is still a mystery today. The only clue that was left about who this young man may be is Shakespeare's dedication to a \\"Mr. W.H\\". There has been much speculation of whether who this young man may be. Many scholars have their own idea of who \\"Mr. W.H.\\" may be. In Raymond Macdonald Alden's book, he has a chapter dedicated to who \\"the friend's\\" true identity may be. William Harte was one name that was thrown out there. William Harte was Shakespeare's nephew but the dates do not match up with the sonnet. Scholar Tyrwhitt suggests the name William Hughes. This name was quite the popular choice. The list goes on and on. Scholars thought any man with the initials \\"W.H.\\" that were active around the same time the sonnets were written could have been this mystery man. Mr. W.H. will remain a mystery till this day.  Exegesis   Overview  It has been debated by many critics and scholars whether or not sonnet 110 was written about Shakespeare's career in the theater or if the sonnet is a confession of love to a young man. The lines in the sonnet could be related to the stage but scholars Virginia L. Radley and David C. Redding disagree stating that sonnet 110 is, \\"addressed to an old friend of the poet's.\\" Sonnet 110 can be interpreted as a confession of love and the mistakes the poet made when he decided to leave his original love. The poet confesses to the young man his infidelities and regrets in order to receive pity from the young man for what the poet did was wrong but should be forgiven since he claimed the young man is the best person he will ever love.  Quatrain 1  There have been many arguments by scholars whether or not the sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and his career in the theater, or if the sonnet is a confession of love to an unknown young man. Shakespeare's use of the word motley has the mind of critics and scholars boggled as to what the sonnet could truly mean. A motley is a multi-colored gown, or costume, usually worn by a jester. Many scholars believe that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's disdain with the theater and the actors, or even his own profession as an actor. Katherine Duncan-Jones believes that the sonnet is about Shakespeare's feelings about his own career as an actor. Scholar Henry Reed agrees with Duncan-Jones and believes that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's own disdain with his acting career. The third line of the quatrain also suggests that the sonnet could be about the theater. Gored could be used in the sense of sewing triangular sized cloths into the motley that would be worn by the actor. However, there are other scholars that would disagree with the two. Among these scholars is Kenneth Muir who says, \\"the theatrical image does not imply that he was referring to his job as an actor.\\" According to Virginia Radley and David Redding, the interpretation of the sonnet being about Shakespeare's profession as an actor is wrong. Radley and Redding suggests that \\"sonnet 110 has nothing to do with the stage, or the acting, or the play writing.\\" Radley and Redding interpreted the first quatrain as the poets confession of promiscuity. Lines 1-2 suggests that the poet has been around and has made a fool of himself for the world to see. Here, the word motley is used as in \\"I played the fool.\\" Line 3 suggests that the poet put himself on display and gave away his precious love. With the use of the word gored, Radley and Redding translated the phrase \\"gored mine own thoughts\\" to \\"wounded my best thoughts\\". The last line of this quatrain uses the word offences is used in the correct term as in offending the poet's lover by this new affairs he has encountered. By the end of this quatrain, the reading of the sonnet slowly becomes clear that this a confession of love versus Shakespeare's disdain with the theater.  Quatrain 2  Quatrain 2 continues with the poet confessing about his journey on finding false love. In line 5, the phrase \\"looked on truth\\" is used in terms that the poet has seen what is true. Scholar Stephen Booth has interpreted the line: \\"I have seen truth, but I have not properly regarded it.\\" Booth's interpretation gives insight about the poet's disregard for the lover's affection. Line 5 continuing onto line 6 can be interpreted about the poet's journey of promiscuity and finding new lovers. The use of the word \\"askance\\" is used in this case as the poet's disdain with the affairs he has encountered. \\"Askance and strangely\\" are used to describe how none of these loves compare to what he had experienced with this young man. The word blenches can be translated into modern English as a flaw. The interpretation of line 7 can mean that these flawed affairs gave me a blink of youth. Booth has multiple interpretations of what this line could possibly mean. His interpretations is that it \\"rejuvenated [the poet] and gave [him] another chance to learn by trial and error\\" or that it \\"rejuvenated [his love]\\". The end of this quatrain ends the poets confession of failed attempts of finding the ideal love and starts his confession of love to the young man. The last line is a very powerful way to end the quatrain and start the next section. \\"Worse essays\\" is used in this line to describe the failed \\"experiments\\" of the poet. The failed experiments proved that the young man is the best love that he has encountered.  Quatrain 3  As the sonnet is coming to an end, the poet expresses his devotion. He explains how he is done trying to find new affections. Radley and Redding explain that the \\"no end\\" he speaks of is his undying devotion. He no longer wants to go through these trials. He explains how he is done trying to find new affections. He realizes over the course of his quest that he ends up back to the young man, which is where he originally began on his quest. The use of \\"on newer proof\\" is used as a description of the poet's trials he went through to come up with this conclusion of full devotion. He continues to express to the young man that he is \\"confined\\" to him, promising him to never stray away from the young man when temptations arise. The use of the word confine suggests that the poet is fully devoted to the young man. He is only \\"limited\\" to the young man.  Couplet  The couplet brings the sonnet together in a happy light. Throughout the sonnet we're learning about the poet's dark confessions to finding his ideal love and realizing the only love that he needs the most is of the young mans. Jane Roessner notices how the line \\"then give me welcome, next my heaven the best\\" is \\"the poet's need of pity from the young man and how his long confession important for its effect on the young man, calculated to move him to a certain response.\\" Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to embrace him. The phrase in line 13 \\"next my heaven the best\\" is the poet confessing to the young man that his love is like his heaven. He is the closest thing to the divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, \\"your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person.\\" The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.

It breeds along a wide distribution range from the Caspian Sea to the Altai Mountains in Central Asia and winters in parts of Southern Asia. Like other buntings it is found in small flocks. Description left This bunting has a long pink bill and is greyish above. The male has a distinctive white eye-ring that stands out in contrast to the grey hood. The chin and throat are whitish pink and are bordered by grey malar stripes. The underparts are pinkish brown. The female is duller but the moustachial stripe can appear more noticeable. The outer tail feathers are whitish. The species was described by Edward Blyth based on a drawing by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton after whom the species is named. It has been suggested that the actual date of the description was 1845 due to delays in the publication of the journal of The Asiatic Society. A supposed type specimen in the Indian Museum was never located. In winter it makes a short subdued click note but the song is a metalling jingle made of swee-swee notes ending with a dzwe-ee-dul. Three subspecies are noted nominate buchanani, neobscura, and ceruttii. Habitat and distribution Emberiza buchanani 141x141pxThis bunting is found mainly in dry and open habitats, often stony, scrubby hillsides covered with low thorn scrub. Birds that breed in the Baluchistan region winter in India moving through Gujarat in September and returning in March to their breeding grounds. It is found in Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Nepal, China, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Oman, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. It is an extremely rare vagrant north of its breeding range, with recent records from Finland and the Netherlands, though wanderers may be overlooked due to its similarity, in non-breeding plumage, to the closely related and far commoner ortolan bunting. They winter in parts of Africa, West Asia, and parts of South Asia as far south as Sri Lanka. Its natural habitat is temperate grassland mainly below 7000 ft. In winter it is found in weedy or stubbly fields. It nests on the ground under some overhanging vegetation. The nest is lined with grass and hair. The song given from a perch is a series of short and shrill notes that increase in volume. A tick Hyalomma turanicum has been recorded on birds from Kazakhstan. Claud Ticehurst noted that males and females migrated separately.

Juveniles are similar to females but with buffier head stripes and a paler, browner throat. After the breeding season, juveniles moult partially and adults moult completely so all primaries and secondaries are the same age. Cinnamon-breasted bunting songs are composed of short, high-pitched, rapid trills. Males are known to have eight distinct songs with 40 discrete syllables.Osiejuk, Tomasz S. 2011. The song of the Cinnamon-breasted Bunting, Emberiza tahapisi, in the Bamenda Highlands (NW Cameroon). Journal of Ornithology. 152:651‚Äì659 Song similarity decreases with distance between local populations but all end with a characteristic final whistle syllable. Individuals perform songs from elevated positions such as from trees, bushes, or rocks.  Distribution and habitat  Having a very widespread distribution, cinnamon-breasted buntings are found across most of mainland sub-Saharan AfricaHarrison, J. A. 1997. The atlas of Southern African birds. Johannesburg: BirdLife South Africa but avoiding deserts, equatorial forest, and the high altitudes of mountains. They can be found in rocky, lightly wooded hillsides with sparse vegetation and bare soil but can sometimes be found in woodlands. There is some degree of partial migration with certain populations moving north during the rainy season and south during the dry season as well as moving to lower elevations during winter.  Behavior and ecology  Breeding time varies depending on the rainy season of the region. In arid regions with light rainfall, the breeding season will occur throughout the rainy season but in regions with heavier rainfall, the breeding season occurs at the end of the rainy season. They are monogamous but solitary nesters. The nest is built from twigs and grass and typically placed on the ground in a shaded area. Incubation and care for young is performed by both males and females. Incubation lasts 12‚Äì14 days and offspring fledge 14‚Äì16 days post-hatch but continue to feed in parental territory for three weeks. The clutch size is 2-4 and the eggs are greenish- or bluish-white with dark brown or reddish-brown speckles. Cinnamon-breasted buntings are ground gleaners that primarily eat seeds but have also been known to eat insects, especially in captivity. They will also sometimes jump to pull seeds. Chicks are fed seeds and insects by parents.Kruger N. P., South Africaalt=left They are commonly spotted alone or in pairs but also flock in groups of 3‚Äì4, and even 6-8 but less frequently so. However, migrating birds can be found in flocks of 40. Tail flicks are a common behavior that defines Emberiza and is used while hopping on the ground to make them more conspicuous to mates and other birds.Andrew, R. J. 1956. Intention Movements of Flight in Certain Passerines, and Their Use in Systematics. Behaviour. 10:179-204. Courtship behavior includes males chasing the female through the air, males bringing nest materials to nest and making ‚Äúnest shaping movements‚Äù,Andrew, R. J. 1956. The Aggressive and Courtship Behaviour of Certain Emberizines. Behaviour. 10:255-308. and females quivering their wings while making a special repeating eep sound. Aggressive behavior includes a head forward position with bill snapping or gaping, with bill snapping occurring more frequently when fear is stronger than aggression. When fighting, special chaa, eee, and chu chatter sounds are made. Fear responses include freezing and observing when the perceived threat level is low, fleeing, and making alarm calls. Higher intensity behavior includes mobbing.Andrew, R. J. 1956. Fear responses in Emberiza spp. The British Journal of Animal Behaviour. 4:125-132.  Relationship to humans  Cinnamon-breasted buntings may occasionally enter towns and in some countries they are caught for cagebird trade but adapt well in captivity.  Status  According to the IUCN, they are categorized as least concern.BirdLife International 2016. Emberiza tahapisi. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2016: e.T103767669A94690689. http://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-3.RLTS.T103767669A94690689.en. Downloaded on 04 December 2019. However, their range has expanded since 1985 due to climate change and habitat fragmentation.

A right-handed relief pitcher, he appeared in 176 games pitched (all but two in a bullpen role) over six seasons (1969‚Äì74) for the California Angels, Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball. The native of Alexandria, Louisiana, attended Mississippi State University. He was listed at tall and . Playing career Stellar MLB debut Tatum's professional career began when he signed with the Angels in 1966 after he was selected in the second round of the secondary phase of the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft. In his fourth minor league season, in , he was converted from a starting pitcher to a relief role, and he was recalled by the Angels in May. He quickly established himself as the team's top short reliever‚Äîthe term \\"closer\\" was not then in use. By the end of July, he had amassed seven saves and three wins in relief, with an earned run average of 0.95 in 21 games.Retrosheet: 1969 pitching log for Ken Tatum He finished the year with a win-loss record of 7‚Äì2, 22 saves, and an earned run average of 1.36 in 45 games pitched. He placed fourth in American League Rookie of the Year balloting. Tatum began with another skein of excellent relief pitching. During the season's first two months, he appeared in 20 games, won two of three decisions, netted eight saves, and posted a 1.00 ERA in 27 innings pitched.Retrosheet: 1970 pitching log for Ken Tatum But in the eighth inning of his 20th appearance on May 31, while he was in the process of notching a four-inning save in a 6-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Anaheim Stadium, Tatum threw a pitch that hit the Orioles' Paul Blair in the face.\\"Angels Triumph Over Orioles, 6‚Äê1; Blair Is Injured,\\" United Press International (UPI), Sunday, May 31, 1970. Retrieved October 15, 2020 Blair sustained a broken nose, orbital floor fractures below his left eye and a broken cheekbone,\\"Tatum Apologizes For Blair Beaning,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Thursday, June 4, 1970. Retrieved October 15, 2020 and he missed three weeks of action; his vision, however, was not affected. He remained the Orioles' regular center fielder through and retired from the Majors during the campaign. The beaning was unintentional, as Tatum had grazed the jersey front of the previous batter Boog Powell. Decline after Blair beanball But the incident may have been a turning point that ruined Tatum's career. Affected by Blair's traumatic injury, he became reluctant to pitch inside. By August 1, his earned run average had risen by two full points to 3.00 and it would climb as high as 3.30 on August 30 before he was able to string together enough effective appearances to lower it to 2.94 at season's end. For the year, he went 7‚Äì4 with 17 saves in 62 games. Wrote Peter Gammons in 2013: \\"After [Tatum] retired, he admitted he pitched with the fear 'that I might kill someone. I could never pitch on the inside half of the plate again.'\\" Ten days after the 1970 season ended, the Angels traded Tatum to the Red Sox in a six- player swap that brought slugger Tony Conigliaro to Anaheim. (Ironically, Conigliaro's career was curtailed by the after-effects of a beanball in a game between the Red Sox and Angels on August 18, 1967.) But Tatum was ineffective in Boston. In his first game, on April 8, 1971, he blew a 2‚Äì1 ninth-inning lead for Sonny Siebert and lost to the Cleveland Indians on a walk-off single to Gomer Hodge.Retrosheet box score: 1971-04-08 Tatum recovered to pitch well over his next 16 games, but on May 23, he was injured by a line drive to the face during batting practice. Coincidentally, he fractured his cheekbone, and the injury occurred in Baltimore, with Blair still an Oriole stalwart. Tatum would miss a full month of action, and his pitching suffered. He ended the season having worked in only 36 games, with a 2‚Äì4 record, 4.09 earned run average and only nine saves. Troubled by a nerve problem in his back and leg, he would appear in only 22 games in , and spend most of in the minor leagues before Boston included him in an off-season trade to the St. Louis Cardinals. After spending the spring training of with the Redbirds, he was traded again in April, to the White Sox, where he got into ten games. He retired at the close of that season. All told, Tatum compiled a 16‚Äì12 record in the big leagues with 52 saves and a career ERA of 2.93. He allowed 230 hits and 117 bases on balls in 282 innings pitched, with 156 strikeouts.

It is the only species in the genus Eminia. The grey- capped warbler is found in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Is a large, chunky, thin-tailed- warbler with a distinctive grey cap, black band that's around its head, and a chestnut throat wrapping its neck. They maintain a diet of insects and other invertebrates, including caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers, mantids, etc. Identification 15 cm; 16‚Äì24 g. A large, chunky, thin-tailed warbler with distinctive grey cap, a black band around head and chestnut throat; rump feathers long and lax. Cheek, neck, and underparts are grey, tinged olive- green on flanks and undertail-coverts; most have chestnut vent patch; upperparts, tail and median and greater upper wing-coverts olive-green, lesser coverts and underwing-coverts chestnut; flight-feathers dark brown, edged olive-green; iris reddish-brown; bill and mouth black; legs pinkish-brown. Sexes alike. Juvenile is duller than an adult, with smaller, paler throat patch and brown eyes, when recently fledged has prominent yellow gape and shorter tail. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist shrubland. Habitat Dense undergrowth, scrub, and creepers, usually in damp areas along forest edges, seeps, or riparian strips; also well-planted gardens. Confined to areas with annual rainfall exceeding 500 mm. Usually above 800 m; to 2500 m in Kenya. Movement is Sedentary. Diet and Foraging Diet insects and other invertebrates, including caterpillars and moths (Lepidoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), mantids (Mantodea), spiders (Araneae), and millipedes (Diplopoda). Forages by gleaning from foliage and bark, actively searching among dead, curled-up leaves, crevices in bark, and holes in twigs. Secretive; skulks among dense vegetation, easily overlooked if not singing. Joined a large variety of frugivorous and insectivorous species attracted to stand of fruiting Euclea Divinorum trees in Tanzania. Sounds and Vocal Behavior Male song, from exposed perch, mainly during the breeding season, a loud, varied series of trills and whistles, lasting 6‚Äì20 seconds, typically containing a number of repeated elements, song uttered every c. 30 seconds; female utters dry trill with up to 7 notes per second, usually during the male song, in poorly developed duet. Male also utters trilling call; alarm a soft ‚Äúpree‚Äù, or louder scolding calls when agitated. Breeding Breeds during rains; Mar-Jun and Oct‚ÄìNov in Sudan and DRCongo, Apr-May in Uganda, and May‚ÄìAug and Nov‚ÄìJan in Kenya; multiple broods attempted. Probably monogamous, partners apparently remain together throughout the year; solitary, territorial. When singing together, partners sit close together or hop around each other, with throat feathers raised and tail fanned and erect; once duet ends, male bends forward, holding long back, rump, and flank feathers raised in the manner of a puff back (Dryoscopus). Nest built by both sexes, male sometimes calls while female builds, construction of one nest took 2 weeks; an untidy, ball-shaped structure, side entrance with protruding porch (up to 8 cm long) and platform (2¬∑5 cm), made of long strips of fibrous vegetation and leaves, woven together and lined with moss, spider web, rootlets, feathers and plant down, suspended from thin branch or creeper inside dense vegetation, once slung between two saplings, usually, 1‚Äì3 m (rarely 5 m) up, often over water, where it resembles debris lodged in the overhanging branch; nest sometimes re-used in successive seasons; one record of weaver (Ploceidae) nest being used after entrance modified and long, trailing vegetation added to enhance camouflage. Clutch 2‚Äì3 eggs; incubation mainly by the female, period 12‚Äì13 days; chicks fed by both sexes, the male often passing food to female and she then feeding nestlings, both also remove feces, dropping them some distance from the nest; fledging period c. 16 days; adults accompany fledglings, call loudly if approached. Breeding success low, average only 0¬∑27 broods/pair/year in Kenya (multiple attempts during protracted breeding season); some streamside nests destroyed by floodwaters.

The species was described in 1836, from a specimen collected in Nepal. It is a medium-sized forktail, weighing between 25 and 29 grams, with a length of . The species has a broad white stripe across its forehead. The crown, face, and mantle are black, while the bird's underparts are white, sharply divided from the black above. The wings are largely black with a broad white stripe across the greater coverts. The tail of the species, similar to that of other forktails, is long, graduated, and deeply forked. The tail is black with a white tip and three white bands created by shorter tail feathers. The beak of the bird is black, while the feet and legs are light pink, and the iris is brown. The species is monomorphic. The black backed forktail is solitary, but is occasionally found in pairs or in family groups. It is described as a shy species. The bird breeds between March and June, building a nest of plant matter in holes or crevices in rocks and dead trees. Three eggs are generally laid, which are pink and spotted with red-brown. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs. The species frequents fast-flowing rivers and streams in temperate forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.

The highest tertial feather is white, and the inner primaries have white tips and the base of the secondaries are covered in a small white patch. The flight feathers are otherwise black. As with most other forktails, the tail of the species is long, graduated, and deeply forked. The feathers are black, with white tips, except for the outermost feathers, which are white. The tail has a white tip and three white bands created by the ends of shorter tail feathers. The beak of the species is black, while the feet and legs are whitish-pink or a light flesh colour. The iris is brown or dark brown. The black-backed forktail does not exhibit sexual dimorphism, and has no known geographic variation in its appearance. Nothing is known of its moulting. Juveniles of the species lack the prominent white stripe across the forehead, and the areas that are black on the adult are sooty brown or dull black. Juveniles have a white spot behind the eye, and may have dark scales or speckles on its flanks, breast, and belly. The tail of the juvenile is usually shorter, while the mandible is yellowish, and the maxilla have whitish cutting edges. The bird is similar to the slaty-backed forktail, but lacks the slaty back of the latter, and is also smaller in size. It also has a slimmer bill. The white band on its face is narrower than that of the otherwise similar white-crowned forktail: it is also distinguished by its white, rather than black, breast. Field identification guides describe it as being the same size as bulbul species. Its call is described as a short and whistled \\"tseep - dew\\" or \\"hurt-zeee\\". The two syllables of this call are sometimes produced separately, as a hollow \\"huu\\" and a shrill \\"zeee\\", which are somewhat higher pitched than the call of the slaty-backed forktail. It produces a two syllable call when disturbed. It also makes a call similar to that of the slaty-backed forktail, described as being reminiscent of a squeaky hinge. It has been described as occasionally producing a short song as well. Behavior and ecology The species is solitary, or occasionally found in pairs, but may be seen in family groups during the breeding season. Described as a shy bird, it often bobs its tail when feeding, and when at rest opens and closes it with a scissor-like motion. It habitually flies along the course of a river or stream, and its flight is described as quick and straight, occasionally undulating slightly. It has been observed near waterfalls. The precise diet of the black-backed forktail is unknown, but it has been observed to consume aquatic insects, the larvae of these insects, and crustaceans. It typically forages along fast-moving streams and rivers, including on rocks in midstream, and may occasionally enter the water. It may also forage along slower-moving rivers, ponds, or forest pools, and has been recorded as foraging in damp areas of the forest. When inactive, it has been observed to remain in bushes or low shrubbery. The breeding season of the black-backed forktail is between March and June. The nest consists of a cup constructed of plant matter, including dried leaves, moss, and fibres, sometimes lined with leaf skeletons. It may be located in the hole of a dead tree, under a bank, on a ledge, or in a hole or cleft among rocks. Usually, three eggs are laid, which are pinkish and sparsely specked with fine red- brown. The speckles occasionally form blotches or caps at the end of the eggs. The eggs have been recorded as averaging in length and in width. Both male and female birds participate in the construction of the nest and in incubation. Though the species is largely sedentary, first-year birds disperse from their parental breeding areas between April and October. Range and distribution The black-backed forktail's habitat of choice is near fast-flowing rivers and streams in moist tropical broadleaf forest and subtropical lowland forest. It frequents rocks and boulders within or bordering streams, as well as mud or sand banks bordering rapidly moving stretches of water. The western end of the species's range is in Garhwal, in the northwest portion of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The range extends from there through western and central Nepal to Bhutan and the northeastern Indian states, including Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur. It is known as a winter visitor to Nameri National Park in Assam. West of Sikkim the species is uncommon, but it is common in Bhutan. It is also found in the Sylhet and Chittagong regions of Bangladesh, where it is uncommon. The range extends to Myanmar, except for the region of Tenasserim, and to northwestern Thailand. It has also been reported from southwestern Yunnan in China, and from southeastern Tibet. Birdlife International maps its range as being contiguous over these regions, except for an area in south Myanmar separated from the rest of the range. Field guides for birds in south Asia describe its distribution as discontinuous. In the western part of its range the species is found up to above sea level; in the eastern part, up to above sea level. In Nepal its elevational range is described as above sea level. In 1998 the species was recorded at above sea level in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh. It breeds largely below in India and Bhutan. The population of the species is unknown, but is believed to be stable, and larger than 10,000 individuals. Its precise range is also unknown, but is thought to be larger than 20,000 square kilometres. These estimates have led to its being classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Scientifically described in 1818, it has six subspecies, each occupying a different geographic range. The largest of the forktails, Enicurus leschenaulti, is between long. It has a black throat and breast, black mantle, and largely black wings. The rump and lower back are white, and the bird has a prominent white crown, from which it gets its name. As with other forktails, the tail is long, deeply forked, and banded in black and white. A variety of whistling and clicking calls have been described. Slight morphological differences have been observed between subspecies. A shy bird, the white-crowned forktail stays near water, and forages on the edges of rivers and streams for invertebrates. Its breeding season is between March and September, and possibly extends till October. Its nests are also built near the water, and are constructed of plant material. The eggs are between two and five in number, though there is latitudinal variation. Multiple broods in a year have been observed in China. The white-crowned forktail is found in China, Southeast Asia and also in northeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Its elevational range varies across its range, from a minimum of above sea level to a maximum of . It is categorized as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy The white-crowned forktail was scientifically described in 1818 by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot. The specimen described came from Java. It is closely related to the Bornean forktail (Enicurus borneensis) which replaces it in mountain areas of Borneo. Six subspecies have been described. E. l. indicus is found from Sikkim to Myanmar, the Chinese province of Yunnan, northern Thailand, and Vietnam. E. l. sinensis is found in southern and eastern China, including in the regions of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. E. l. frontalis is seen in the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula, on the islands of Nias and Sumatra, and in the lowland regions of Borneo. E. l. chaseni is found only on Batu island. E. l. leschenaulti is found in Java and on the island of Bali. E. l. borneensis is found in the highland regions of Borneo. The two sub-species found in Borneo, which have different elevational ranges, are genetically relatively distant. The upland subspecies E. l. borneensis may be a separate species, but is morphologically not very distinct from the other subspecies of E. leschenaulti. Birds of the borneensis subspecies appeared to breed between mountaintops, but not with individuals of the subspecies frontalis in the valleys in between. The species was found to be more distantly related to the slaty-backed forktail and the little forktail than to other forktail species. The precise geographic delineation between E. l. borneensis and E. l. frontalis is not known. Description A white-crowned forktail, painted sometime between 1825 and 1834 The white-crowned forktail is the largest of the forktails. Between long, the white-crowned forktail typically weighs between , though specimens weighing up to have been reported. It has black feathering on its throat extending down to its breast, as well as a black face and scapulars. The crown and forehead have a prominent white patch, sometimes visible as a slight crest, from which the bird gets its name. The belly of the bird is white, and is sharply delineated from the throat and face. The lower back and rump of the bird are white. The tail of the species is long and evenly graduated, with a deep fork. It has white tips, and the outer feathers are white. It also has three narrower white bands created by the tips of shorter tail feathers. The wings of this species are largely black with a prominent white band across the greater coverts. Juveniles of the species have brownish black upperparts, breast, and throat, brown flanks, and brown mottling on the belly. They also lack the prominent white crown. The bill of the species is black, while the feet are pinkish in color. Its mantle is completely black, a feature used to distinguish the species from the spotted forktail, which has a speckled mantle, and from the slaty-backed forktail, which has a slate-grey mantle. It is distinguished from the black- backed forktail by its longer tail and larger size. The Indian subspecies E. l. indicus has a bill slightly longer than the nominate subspecies E. l. leschenaulti, while the bill of the Chinese subspecies E. l. sinensis is slightly shorter than that of the nominate. The subspecies frontalis is somewhat smaller than the others, and the extent of white on its crown is smaller: E. l. borneensis is similar to frontalis but has a longer tail. E. l. chaseni is larger than birds from the rest of Sumatra, and also has a longer tail. Multiple calls have been observed. The alarm call and contact calls are high-pitched, ringing lengthy whistles, described as \\"tseee, tseee\\" or \\"zweeet\\": these calls are repeated multiple times, with pauses in between. The alarm call is harsher and more emphatic, described as \\"scree\\" or \\"scree chit chit\\". Males use a long and complex whistled song when displaying or exhibiting territorial behavior; this often consists of a long whistle that fades away, followed by shorter whistles, clicking or chacking noises, or bell-like sounds. The call of the borneensis subspecies is slightly different from the others. Distribution and habitat The habitat of the white-crowned forktail is subtropical or tropical regions in moist lowland forests and moist broadleaf montane forests. As is the case with other forktail species, the white-crowned forktail frequents fast-flowing rivers, waterfalls, and streams within the forests, though it may move to slower moving water sources in the winter. Its elevational range has been observed to vary seasonally, and in the northeastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, it is likely to migrate seasonally; all records from Bangladesh are from winter months. It also frequents damp areas and pools within the forest, including animal wallows, swampy areas, and water ditches. It may be found along slower-moving rivers and streams in the lowland regions of its distribution. It prefers areas screened by dense vegetation. On the island of Borneo the white-crowned forktail is sometimes found in drier areas, including along tracks and ridges in the forest, and in heathland. The white-crowned forktail has a wide geographic distribution across south and south-east Asia, including in parts of India, Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Bhutan, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. The elevational range of the species varies across its geographic distribution. In the Eastern Himalayas the species is generally found below above sea level, though occasionally found till , and exceptionally at in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. In Sumatra and Borneo it is generally seen up to an elevation of . The subspecies borneensis is found at , but occasionally as low as . It is common through most of its range but uncommon in the Himalayas. In the Chinese portion of its range, it is reported to be the most common forktail. Though the population of the species is not precisely known, it is thought to be greater than 10,000 individuals, and is estimated to be stable. It is categorized as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Behavior and ecology As with other forktails, the white-crowned forktail keeps close to water. It has been observed to frequently wag its tail. It forages along the edges of streams and in the water, primarily for insects, such as black beetles, water crickets, springtails, and caterpillars. Described as a shy bird, it flies close to the ground, usually calling as it does. It is thought to shift its elevational range slightly with the time of year. The white-crowned forktail breeds between the months of March and September, and possibly till October. The breeding period varies slightly across its range. Eggs have been recorded as early as March in Borneo, and on one occasion a parent with a fledgling was recorded in February. The nest is constructed of moss, plants, leaves, and wood fibre, and is in the shape of a large cup. It is usually located near or over the water, and occasionally in forest gullies nearby. It is usually placed in a hole in a bank or cliff, or among tree roots, and has been observed to have been constructed behind waterfalls, with the birds flying through the water to reach their nest. The location of the nest is always damp. The species usually lays between two and five eggs, which are creamy, pinkish, or greyish white, and covered in speckles of red-brown, salmon, and lilac. Birds in southern China have been observed to have two broods in a year, a pattern which may hold true elsewhere. The number of eggs in a brood varies with latitude, with individuals in China regularly being recorded laying four to five eggs. The nests of the species have been observed in Myanmar to be parasitized by the Drongo cuckoo.

A slim, medium-sized forktail, it is distinguished from similar species by its slate grey forehead, crown, and mantle. It has a long and deeply forked tail banded in black and white, a white rump, and a white bar across its primary feathers; the rest of the plumage is predominantly white. The sexes look alike. The bird frequents the edges of fast-flowing streams and rivers, where it hunts small invertebrates by hopping among rocks or flying out over the water. It breeds between February and July, laying 3‚Äì4 pinkish, bluish, or white eggs; both sexes incubate the eggs. The slaty-backed forktail is found near streams and rivers in tropical and subtropical regions, occasionally straying further from flowing water to the edges of roads and trails. Generally a solitary bird, it may occasionally be found in pairs, or in family groups in the breeding season. One of its calls has been described as similar to that of the Blyth's kingfisher, for which it has been mistaken. The forktail is found in the central and eastern Himalayas, the Indian Sub-continent, southern China and continental Southeast Asia. Its wide distribution and apparently stable population have led to it being classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy and systematics The slaty-backed forktail was described scientifically in 1836 by British naturalist Brian H. Hodgson. It was originally placed in a new subgenus Enicurus in the genus Motacilla, which contains the wagtails. The specimen used to describe the species came from Nepal. The species name is the Latin adjective schistaceus \\"slaty-grey\\". The slaty-backed forktail is currently placed within the family Muscicapidae, which includes Old World flycatchers and chats. A genetic study found that the slaty-backed forktail and the little forktail were genetically more distinct from the white-crowned forktail than were other forktail species. Description The slaty-backed forktail is a slim, medium-sized forktail between long, and weighs between . It is coloured slate-grey, black, and white. The bill is black, while the feet of the bird are a pale pinkish or greyish colour. The iris has been described as dark brown, though it has been recorded as black in certain specimens. It has a black throat and a narrow white stripe across its face till just behind the eyes, sometimes describe as a white mask. The white stripe sometimes includes a white eye ring, which may be either complete or partial. Its ear coverts, chin, and face are also black. The forehead, crown, sides of the neck, and the scapulars are slate grey. It has black wing-coverts, a white patch at the base of the primaries, wide white bars on otherwise black wings, and also a large white patch on its rump and lower back. The bases of the flight feathers are white, which is occasionally visible as a little additional bar on the wing. The tail of the bird is long and evenly graduated, with a deep fork. The tail is largely black except for a white tip. It also has three white bands along its length, formed by the white tips of shorter tail feathers. The juvenile of the species lacks a white forehead, is brown above, and has dark scales on its breast. The tail of the juvenile is shorter than that of the adult: juveniles also have greyish or yellowish lores, and greyish or white chin and throat. The flanks are a dull grey-brown. It is not sexually dimorphic. Some specimens have been observed to have white tips to their primaries. This feature has been hypothesized to be the result of aging or of wear and tear, and has been observed throughout the distribution of the species. It is known not to be sex-related. Though very similar to the black-backed forktail Enicurus immaculatus, it is distinguished by its slate-grey mantle and crown, from which it gets its name. It also has a slightly larger bill than the black-backed forktail, and slightly less white on its forehead. Vocalizations One of the slaty-backed forktail's calls has been described as a \\"high, thin, sharp, metallic screech, ''teenk'\\", similar to that made by a small kingfisher; in particular, it has been mistaken for the call of the Blyth's kingfisher Alcedo hercules. Another call is described as a mellow \\"cheet\\". It also produces a repeated, harsh screeching call when alarmed. Distribution and habitat The slaty-backed forktail is found near fast-flowing water bodies in tropical and sub-tropical montane broadleaf forests, as well as near cultivated areas. These include rocky streams and rivers, including broad rivers and valleys in plains areas. A 2000 paper studying birds in northwest India and Nepal found that the incidence of slaty-backed forktails decreased with altitude. The study also found that the slaty-backed forktail had a preference for streams that were bordered by dense and complex vegetation, and had firm and stable banks of earth. They also preferred streams with finer grained sand on the bottom, and with \\"pool‚Äìriffle sequences.\\" More rarely the bird is seen in secluded areas of the forest, and on the sides of roads or trails near the water. In winter months it has been observed to move from the mountains into foothills and plains areas. The species is found in the central and eastern Himalayas, from the Indian state of Uttarakhand in the west to Myanmar in the East, including Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a vagrant in Bangladesh. It is also found in southern China, in southeast Tibet, and in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian and Zhejiang, and possibly in Hainan. Its range in South-East Asia includes Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, peninsular Malaysia, and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, it is only an occasional winter visitor or highly uncommon resident. Its distribution in southeast Asia is discontinuous. The elevational range of the slaty-backed forktail varies geographically. It has been estimated as 300-1600m above sea level in northern India, 900‚Äì1675 in Nepal, 400‚Äì1800 in southern China and the adjacent areas of Thailand, above 500m in Cambodia, above 800m in Malaysia, and 800-2200m in Bhutan. In the winter, it has been recorded as low as 200m above sea level. The range of the species has not been precisely determined, but is known to be very large. The population is thought to be stable, and though its size is not precisely known, it is thought to be greater than 10,000 individuals. It is categorized as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is common in the parts of its range that occur in China, Nepal, and South-East Asia. Behavior and ecology The slaty-backed forktail breeds between February and July; the breeding period does not appear to vary across its range. It builds a nest with materials including bryophytes, leaves, and grass. The shape of the nest can be a cup or part of a dome, depending on where it is built. It frequently has an outer layer of mud. The nest may be constructed in holes in the ground or in the trunks of trees, between the roots of trees, in hollows of dead trees, and sometimes within crevices in rocks. The bird lays three to four eggs that vary from pure white to pinkish white to bluish white, with lavender or reddish brown spots. The spots are more common on the larger end of the egg. Both sexes incubate the eggs. The species is thought to have two or three broods in a year. The species feeds on small invertebrates found in or around the water, including larvae and crustaceans. It forages at the edge of the water, and is described as \\"moving restlessly\\". It forages on and among rocks at the edges of the water as well as in mid-stream; it will occasionally enter the water as well. Though it generally forages by hopping in an agile manner among rocks, it also makes brief forays above the water to snatch food items from the surface. Its flight is described as similar to that of a large wagtail; quick and direct, and slightly undulating. It is seen mostly near the water; usually solitary, it is occasionally observed in pairs, and is described as a shy bird. It constantly bobs its tail, and when disturbed it may raise and open its tail with a quick scissor-like movement. In the breeding season is occasionally in small family groups, while in winter it is most often solitary. However, many birds may forage in a favored section of a stream: 15 birds have been observed along a single stretch of the river in Bhutan. In the South-East Asian parts of its range the bird is sedentary, while in the Himalayas it is observed to move over an elevational gradient.

Largely settled in the 1880s and 1890s by Eastern European immigrants, white flight in the 1990s left the neighborhood largely African American. It is one of the oldest and most culturally diverse neighborhoods in Cleveland today. About the neighborhood St. Clair‚ÄìSuperior boundaries are: E. 55th Street from Lake Erie south to Superior Avenue; Superior Avenue east to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive; Martin Luther King Jr. Drive north to Lake Erie. The neighborhood lacks access to Lake Erie and Gordon Park due to the presence of Interstate 90 and major railroad tracks. Access to Rockefeller Park is also highly limited. The neighborhood's main retail district lines St. Clair Avenue. History of the neighborhood St. Clair‚ÄìSuperior was largely rural and sparsely populated until the 1880s and 1890s, when extensive construction of heavy industry and manufacturing plants occurred along the railroad tracks and the area north of St. Clair Avenue. Large numbers of immigrant Slovenians and Lithuanians moved into the area to work in these plants. The historic St. Vitus's Church, at E. 61st and Lausche Avenue, was the first Slovenian Catholic church built in Cleveland, and at one time was among the largest Slovenian congregations in the United States. Eastern European immigrants brought with them a long beer-making tradition, and during the 1800s and early 1900s the St. Clair‚ÄìSuperior neighborhood was known as \\"the mecca of breweries in Cleveland.\\" In the summer of 2016, the brewing tradition returned to the neighborhood, with the opening of Goldhorn Brewery, which takes its name from a Slovenian folktale and features beers named to commemorate neighborhood specific people and places. The majority of residents in the neighborhood were whites of Eastern European ancestry at least as late as 1991. A major demographic shift occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, so that by 2014 79 percent of residents were African American, and 13 percent white and 5 percent were Hispanic. In 2015, some redevelopment began to occur in the area. One of the biggest projects was Hub 55 on E. 55th Street, a redevelopment that housed a caf√©, market, meeting space, and office space. Most of Hub 55 opened in June 2015. The investors in Hub 55 planned additional redevelopment as of the fall of 2017. By 2015, 33 percent of all homes in the neighborhood had been demolished after falling into disrepair. Another 25 percent of homes in the neighborhood are vacant. Of these vacant homes, the Western Reserve Land Conservancy's Thriving Communities Institute property survey rated nearly 12 percent rate as \\"distressed\\" (an extreme degree of disrepair). This compares to just 9 percent in distressed neighborhoods like Buckeye‚ÄìWoodhill, Glenville, Hough, and Kinsman. The level of reported crime in St. Clair‚ÄìSuperior is not much different from those in gentrifying neighborhoods like Ohio City or Tremont. Unreported crime, however, remains high. Schools St. Martin de Porres High School (a Catholic school) and a branch of Horizon Science Academy (a charter school) are both located in St. Clair‚ÄìSuperior. In 2003, St. Martin de Porres High School, which was located in the former St. Vitus School building, began construction of a $30 million new campus a block away. The first, $21 million phase of the project opened in April 2018. The new building incorporated the facade and copper domes of the historic Kausek Brothers building, a former department store.

It is the only species in the genus Cryptomicroeca. The yellow-bellied flyrobin is endemic to New Caledonia, where it occurs on the island of Grande Terre. It occupies a range of habitats, including dry lowlands, woodland, Pinus and Pandanus forest, and humid forest from sea level up to . Taxonomy The yellow- bellied flyrobin was described in 1860 by the French ornithologists, Jules Verreaux and Oeillet des Murs, from a specimen collected in New Caledonia. They coined the binomial name Eopsaltria flavigastra. The English ornithologist, Richard Bowdler Sharpe, realised that the specific epithet was preoccupied, and in 1903 he proposed flaviventris as a replacement. The species was long considered one of the yellow robins of the genus Eopsaltria. However, a 2009 genetic study showed it to be nested within the flyrobin genus Microeca, and hence it was moved to Microeca, and its common name was changed from yellow-bellied robin to yellow-bellied flyrobin in the online list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). A more comprehensive genetic study of the family Petroicidae, published in 2011, found that the yellow- bellied flyrobin was divergent from the other members of Microeca, and instead was sister to a clade containing the Microeca and the torrent flyrobin. The yellow-bellied flyrobin is now placed as the only species in the genus Cryptomicroeca that was introduced in 2012. Description The yellow-bellied robin is a medium-sized Australasian robin, in length and weighing around .

It is endemic to southwestern Australia. Unlike many other Australian robins, it lacks bright colours in its plumage, being a predominantly greyish bird with white underparts. Like other closely related Australasian robins, it is a cooperative breeder. It is sedentary, with pairs or small groups maintaining territories. Taxonomy The white-breasted robin was first described by the French naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830 as Muscicapa georgiana, taking its name from the site King George Sound, where the authors had collected specimens. It was later described by John Gould in 1846 as Eopsaltria leucogaster, though as the former took precedence, its specific name remains georgiana. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described a paler specimen from Warren River as a distinct subspecies warreni, though this was not recognised subsequently. A 2009 genetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA unexpectedly placed the white-breasted robin as sister taxon to the two Tregellasia robins native to northeastern Australia. This result was confirmed by another molecular phylogenetic study published in 2011. The species is now placed in its own genus Quoyornis, which was introduced by Mathews in 1912. The name combines Quoy's name with the Ancient Greek ornis 'bird'. White- breasted robin is the official name given to this species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). Although, like all Australian robins, it is not closely related to either the European robin or the American robin. Gould had called it 'white-bellied robin' in 1848, and other terms used included grey- breasted or white-breasted shrike-robin from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The 'shrike-' prefix was dropped by the RAOU in 1926. It is known as boydjil by the local indigenous people of Augusta. Description The white-breasted robin ranges between long, with a wingspan of . The male weighs 20.5 g, while the female is lighter at 16.5 g. Males and females are similar in coloration, with blue-grey upperparts, paler eyebrows, and whitish underparts. The grey tail is tipped with white. Bills and feet are black in colour, while eyes are dark brown. Birds from the northern part of its range are smaller and darker grey in colour. Juveniles are brownish. Distribution and habitat The white-breasted robin is found in Western Australia south from Geraldton to the southwest corner of the continent. Within this area, it is mainly restricted to two areas of different habitat. In the main southern part of its range, it is found in an area bounded by Jarrahdale and Woorooloo on or east of the Darling Scarp, and south-east to Beaufort Inlet. Here it occurs in tall forest dominated by karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), where it is found in dense undergrowth of such plant species as karri hazel (Trymalium odoratissimum subsp. trifidum), karri she‚Äìoak (Allocasuarina decussata), and nedik (Bossiaea aquifolium), typically along rivers and gullies. It also inhabits dry sclerophyll forest of karri, jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), and bull banksia (Banksia grandis), where it lives in the 2-3 m high understory. The northern population is found along a narrow band from Geraldton south to Yanchep National Park, where it lives in coastal thickets‚Äîoften covered in dodder‚Äîof Acacia rostellifera, Acacia cyclops, Melaleuca cardiophylla growing over sand dunes on limestone soils. It is sedentary, with pairs or small groups maintaining territories in its range. Young male birds remain around their parents' territories as helper birds for around a year, while females disperse. Behaviour Nesting in Western Australia The white-breasted robin is a cooperative breeder; breeding pairs are often assisted by one or more helper birds that help to raise young. Helper birds are mostly male; female birds are more likely to leave the territory in the first year of their life, while males are more likely to remain. Breeding Breeding season is late winter to early summer, with up to two broods raised. The nest is a neat cup made of dry grass, bark, and spider webs, generally located in a tree-fork in dense scrub, close to a watercourse. Two pale olive- to blue-green eggs, often splotched with a darker variant of the background colour, are laid. They measure 16 mm x 21 mm, and one is often much paler than the other. Incubation lasts 16 or 17 days, with young leaving the nest two weeks after hatching. Feeding The white-breasted robin is insectivorous, foraging for its prey mainly on or near the ground, in or beneath undergrowth.

Described by John Gould in 1838, the western yellow robin and its Australian relatives are not closely related to either the European or American robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. Ranging between long, it has grey upperparts, and a grey breast and head, broken by whitish streaks near the bill and below the eye, with a conspicuous yellow belly. The sexes are similar in appearance. Two subspecies are recognised: subspecies griseogularis, which has a yellow rump, and subspecies rosinae with an olive- green rump. The species inhabits open eucalypt forest, woodland, and scrub, generally favouring habitats with significant understory. Its range comprises the Southwest of Western Australia and the state's southern coastline, as well as the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It breeds in a cup-shaped nest in a tree. Predominantly insectivorous, the western yellow robin pounces on prey from a low branch or forages on the ground. Although it is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species, it has declined in parts of its range. Taxonomy English ornithologist John Gould described the western yellow robin as Eopsaltria griseogularis in 1838, referring to a specimen collected at the Swan River Colony. The genus Eopsaltria had been introduced by English naturalist William Swainson six years earlier for what is now the eastern yellow robin (E. australis). The specific name is derived from the Medieval Latin words griseus, meaning 'grey', and gula meaning 'throat'. Gould reported that it was common both at the new colony on the Swan Coastal Plain and at any site with brush-like shrubs. It was included in the first collection of local fauna assembled for the newly founded Zoological Society of London in the 1830s. In 1979, Western Australian ornithologist Julian Ford proposed a treatment of the western and eastern yellow robin as a single species on account of similarities in calls, ecology and behaviour. Playback of one species' calls in the other's territory evoked a response. Bird taxonomist Richard Schodde did not feel that this finding warranted the lumping of the two species and concluded in 1999 that they formed a superspecies. Analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of Australasian robins in 2009 and 2011 revealed that the divergence between the eastern and western yellow robin was consistent with species-level separation, confirming their status as distinct species. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described a second subspecies‚ÄîEopsaltria griseogularis rosinae‚Äîin 1912, named for Ethel Rosina White, wife of South Australian ornithologist, Samuel Albert White. Schodde observed that the delineation between subspecies does not correspond with a change in habitat and was hence valid. Western yellow robin is the official name given to this species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). Like all Australasian robins, it is not closely related to either the European robin (Erithacus rubecula) or the American robin (Turdus migratorius), but rather belongs in the Australasian robin family Petroicidae. The family is most closely related to the families Eupetidae (rail-babbler), Chaetopidae (rockjumper), and Picathartidae (rockfowl)‚Äîthese all forming a basal lineage in the Passerida. Gould called it 'grey-breasted robin' in 1848, and other terms used included grey-breasted shrike-robin and grey-breasted yellow robin from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The 'shrike-' prefix was dropped by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1926. The earliest recorded name is b'am-boore‚Äîreported by English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert in 1840, and published in Gould's Birds of Australia‚Äîis derived from the Nyungar language. The orthographic or dialectal variations in the notes of colonial authors have been assessed, and a recommendation for regular spelling as bamborn and guide to pronunciation as bam'bam was proposed by Ian Abbott in 2009. Description alt= A grey and yellow bird, viewed from below The western yellow robin ranges between long, with a wingspan of and weight of . The male and female are similar in size and coloration, with no seasonal variation in plumage. The head, neck and upper parts are grey, with a white throat fading into a grey breast. The lores are black, the eyebrows are paler grey, and there is some faint pale streaking over the ear coverts. The underparts are yellow and clearly delineated from the breast. The rump and upper tail coverts are yellow in the nominate subspecies and olive-green in subspecies rosinae. There is a broad area of intermediate coloration between the core ranges of the two subspecies. Birds of subspecies rosinae have longer wings and tail overall, and a shorter bill and tarsus. Those from the west coast between Cliff Head and Kalbarri are significantly smaller overall. Intermediate forms between the two subspecies are found over a broad band between Lancelin and Jurien Bay southeast through the inner Wheatbelt to the coast between Denmark and Fitzgerald River National Park. Juveniles have dark brownish head, neck and upper parts, coarsely streaked with creamy white. The lores are black. The chin and throat are grey-white, the breast is cream and brown, and the belly is white or off-white, tinged with brown. They moult after a few months into immature plumage, resembling adults, but retaining some brownish flight feathers and secondary coverts on their wings and tail. The western yellow robin produces its song with sequences of extended whistles, begun with two briefly piped notes. Its song is often heard before dawn, described as having a mournful quality, and is a familiar sound in southwest forests and woodlands. It also utters a scolding call, transcribed as ch-churr or churr-churr, and a two-syllabled zitting call. Around nesting time, the female utters a courtship or food-begging call, composed of a long note with a deeper staccato note at the end. It does not resemble any other species within its range. The similar eastern yellow robin is only found in the eastern states. Immature birds closely resemble immature white-breasted robins (Quoyornis georgianus), though both are usually close by their respective parents. Young western yellow robins also have an olive tinge to the edges of their flight and tail feathers, and gain yellow feathers on their bellies as they moult from juvenile plumage. Distribution and habitat In Western Australia, the western yellow robin is found south and west of an imaginary line between Kalbarri and Norseman, though it is largely absent from the coastal plain between Dongara and Rockingham. It is a rare vagrant north to Shark Bay and Toolonga Nature Reserve. Along the southern coastline, it occurs in a broken distribution to the South Australian border, at Eucla, Hampton Tableland, and the Roe Plains. In South Australia, it is found from Yalata east to the Eyre Peninsula where it extends north to the Gawler Ranges and east to Middleback Range. It is sedentary across its range. The nominate Eopsaltria griseogularis griseogularis ranges along coastal southwest Western Australia from Lancelin in the north and inland to Northam and southeast to King George Sound. Subspecies Eopsaltria griseogularis rosinae occurs from Jurien Bay and Tamala then inland across the Wheatbelt and Goldfields to the southeastern Western Australian coastline, across the Great Australian Bight and on the Eyre Peninsula. Within its range, the western yellow robin is found in eucalypt forest and woodland, and mallee and acacia-shrubland in drier (semi-arid) regions. Fieldwork in the Dryandra Woodland found that it prefers locations with thicker canopy, a thicker layer of leaf litter and logs. The latter two directly provide habitat for insects upon which the western yellow robin feeds, while the canopy makes for cooler ground temperatures (as well as more leaf litter) that is also favourable to insects. The presence of wandoo trees (Eucalyptus wandoo) and shrubs of the genus Gastrolobium also indicates thicker leaf litter. The species also avoids parts of the woodland bordering on adjacent farmland, as these areas have a thinner layer of leaf litter. In tall jarrah-marri forest, it generally remains in the midstory of bull banksia (Banksia grandis) or understory shrubs. Behaviour The social behaviour of the western yellow robin has been little studied. The species is usually found alone or in pairs, and less commonly in small groups‚Äîmost likely a mated pair and helper birds. In autumn and winter, western yellow robins may join mixed hunting flocks with other insect-eating birds, such as Gilbert's honeyeater (Melithreptus chloropsis), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), grey fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa), and thornbills (Acanthiza species). Breeding Breeding takes place between July and early January, most commonly between September and November. Pairs generally attempt two broods a season. The female has been observed to select the nest site. The nest is located in the fork or on a branch of a tree, usually a eucalypt, such as marri (Corymbia calophylla), jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), and wandoo in Western Australia, or sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) in South Australia. Other trees include snottygobble (Persoonia longifolia), native cypress (Callitris), Jacksonia, Acacia, or she-oak (Casuarinaceae). In more arid country, they may choose mallee eucalypts, bluebush (Maireana), or quandong (Santalum acuminatum). Fieldwork in the Dryandra Woodland found nests were located in the lower part of the tree canopy, so birds were able to have a clear view of the ground, and be concealed by foliage from aerial predators above. The nest is an open cup made of strips of bark, grass, and twigs. Spider webs, dried wattle, and gum leaves are used for binding or lining. It is high and wide, with a wide inner cup-shaped depression. The female builds the nest, and is fed by the male and helper birds during this time. Incubation is thought to be around 15 days. The clutch generally numbers two or rarely three buff, pale yellow or pearl-grey eggs that are irregularly marked with red-brown and are 18‚Äì22 mm long by 15‚Äì16 mm wide. The eggs are more elongated than those of the eastern yellow robin. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; that is, they are born blind and naked. They are fed by both parents and helpers, and the female leaves to forage for herself during this period. The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica) have been recorded preying on nestlings. The species is selected as a host for brood parasites, specifically the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and the shining bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus). The maximum age recorded from banding has been 8 years, in a bird banded at Kodj Kodjin Reserve, Western Australia, which was caught and released at the same location in June 1994. Feeding Arthropods, particularly insects, form the bulk of the western yellow robin's diet, although seeds are sometimes eaten. It hunts by scanning the ground from branches or trunks of trees, and pouncing on its prey mostly on the ground. One study in Dryandra Woodland found that western yellow robins caught 96% of their prey on the ground, while fieldwork in the same locale showed that they often forage near fallen logs, particularly in the warmer months. Leaf litter near logs often retains more moisture in warmer months and thus shelters more abundant prey. The foraging behaviour was first described as resembling the robins of Europe, making short flights to the ground and returning to a twig or branch and seemingly incapable of sustained flight. The appearance of this behaviour has been familiar to observers near frontiers of land clearing, although the roosting habits are carefully obscured.  Conservation  The IUCN Red List assessed the western yellow robin in 2016 as a least-concern species, noting a large distribution range and population that, while declining, did not meet their criteria for conservation status of vulnerable to extinction. Recognised threat factors to the population trajectory of the western yellow robin are global warming, particularly severe weather events, and anthropogenic alterations that degrade or remove its habitat. The species has declined in parts of the Wheatbelt, particularly around the towns of Kellerberin, Dowerin and Tammin, most likely due to a loss of suitable habitat. Up to 93% of suitable habitat had been cleared in the region by 2002, and much of what is left is compromised; fragmentation of habitat and livestock activity disrupt the litter layer, and Gastrolobium is often removed as it is poisonous to cattle.

Lesson described it in 1844 as Fluvicola leucocephala, and Brehm as Cinura torquata in 1845. John Gould named it Epthianura albifrons in 1838. The derivation of the generic name Epthianura is obscure, coming either from the Ancient Greek ephthos 'refined' or ephthina≈ç 'wasting away' and oura 'tail' (referring to the \\"short and truncated tail\\"). The specific epithet albifrons derives from the Latin albus 'white' and frons 'forehead'. The species is monotypic; that is, no subspecies are recognised. Tasmanian birds were thought to have longer bills but this has not been borne out on further investigation. This species has collected many vernacular names. From its distinctive call were derived the names (banded) tintack, gar and tang, and the males' resemblance to a nun's habit led to the name (white-fronted) nun, and similarly moonface, moonbird, baldyhead, baldy, ringneck, ringlet and singlebar also come from its appearance.

Its preferred habitat is open country with low vegetation, including samphire (Tecticornia), tea-tree (Melaleuca) and heath, in saltmarshes and coastal dunes, in swamp or mangrove margins and around inland salt lakes. It is generally sedentary in the wetter southern part of its range, though it may be nomadic in more arid areas. Behaviour The white-fronted chat is usually conspicuous, perching prominently on bushes, tussocks or fences. However, it is quite secretive in approaching the nest, engaging in distraction displays. They are a gregarious species, often nesting in small colonies. Breeding In the breeding season from June to January, the female builds a cup-shaped nest of grasses and twigs, lined with fine grass, feathers, wool and hair, which is well concealed in tussock or a low shrub. A clutch of 2 to 4 eggs is incubated by both parents for 13‚Äì14 days. The eggs measure and are white, spotted with reddish-brown at the large end. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after 10‚Äì15 days. The nests are occasionally parasitised by Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis). Feeding The white-fronted chat usually forages singly or in small parties, seeking insects in low bushes or on the ground. Their diet consists of a wide variety of insects, including beetles, ants, bees, grasshoppers, moths and caterpillars, as well as spiders, acacia seeds, and nectar. Conservation Status The white-fronted chat has been listed as vulnerable in New South Wales, with a significant decline of 65% recorded for the period 1981‚Äì2005.Jenner, B., French, K., Oxenham, K. and Major, R.E. (2011). \\"Population decline of the White-fronted Chat (Epthianura albifrons) in New South Wales, Australia.\\" Emu111: 84‚Äì91. It is considered threatened in the Adelaide-Mount Lofty region of South Australia, where it has become much rarer. However, it is listed globally as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

Along with the gibberbird in the genus Ashbyia they were once thought to constitute a separate family, the Epthianuridae, although most taxonomists today treat them as a subfamily, Epthianurinae, of the honeyeater family Meliphagidae.Driskel A. & L. Christidis (2004) \\"Phylogeny and evolution of the Australo-Papuan honeyeaters (Passeriformes, Meliphagidae)\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 31 (3): 943-960 Distribution, habitat and movements The genus Epthianura is endemic to the continent of Australia, where they are widely distributed across the mainland and, in the case of the white-fronted chat, Tasmania.Del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D. (editors). (2007). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 12: Picathartes to Tits and Chickadees. Lynx Edicions. With the exception of that species they are generally distributed in the central part of Australia; the white-fronted chat being the most coastal species. The Australian chats have adapted to a wide range of habitat types in the interior of Australia, though they generally are found in more shrubby environments than wooded ones and are also seldom found in high altitudes. They are particularly adapted to arid environments, but also frequent riparian woodlands, temporary and permanent wetlands, herblands, and even human modified farmlands. There are large gaps in the knowledge of the migratory movements of the Australian chats. Some species are apparently nomadic, at least over parts of their range, and others migratory, but the difficulty in reaching and surveying much of their habitat (and the avoidance of the centre of Australia during the height of summer by many observers) means that complete picture of these movements has not yet been obtained. It is also apparent that many of these movements are not only seasonal but dependent on weather conditions, birds may be common in on locality in some years but not in others. This nomadism allows them to make use of unpredictable rainfall in the arid deserts.Williams C.K. (1979) \\"Ecology of Australian Chats (Epthianura Gould): Reproduction in Aridity\\". Australian Journal of Zoology 27 (2): 213 - 229 Description The Australian chats are small honeyeaters adapted to a highly terrestrial existence. The bill is short and slender, and overall they are slightly more rotund than the honeyeaters. In common with the rest of the honeyeaters they have a brush-tipped tongue. The plumage of the genus is sexually dimorphic, with the males having bright (or in the case of the white-fronted chat, striking) colours. The breast and cap of the crimson chat is bright crimson as the name suggests, and the back is dark grey with a white throat. In contrast the female lacks any crimson except on her rump. The male orange and yellow chats have bright yellow/gold plumage, whereas the females are much duller grey. The most unusual species is the white-fronted chat, which in the male has a striking black back and chest band and a white face and belly. The yellow and crimson chats are unusual amongst the honeyeaters in having seasonal differences in plumage, particularly in the males, which are much duller in the non-breeding season. Behaviour The Australian chats are predominantly terrestrial birds. While they will make use of low shrubs, they are seldom seen in the upper levels of trees. They are conspicuous birds, particular the brightly coloured males, and generally unconcerned by human activity, although they are more circumspect in the breeding season around the nest. They generally occur in pairs or small groups, but will form larger flocks during the non-breeding season. Species {  - ! Image !! Scientific name !! Common Name !!

The adult male orange chat is rarely mistaken for another species with its vivid orange colouration and black throat-patch. The male yellow chat is coloured almost as brightly as the orange chat but without such warm orange overtone, being rather an intense lemon yellow. The grey- brown mottled females and immatures have yellow uppertail-coverts and a yellow underbody distinguishing them from the crimson chat, but they are still rather similar in appearance to the female yellow chat. Other common names Orange-breasted, orange-fronted, golden-fronted or bush chat; orange-fronted nun or tang; bush or saltbush canary. Distribution and habitat Orange chats are strongly nomadic within the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia that they inhabit. They are found mainly in the interior with some sightings in the northern tropics, and very occasionally they reach the coastal areas of South and Western Australia.\\"Orange Chat(Epthianura aurifrons).\\" 2013. The Internet Bird Collection. 23 Oct 2013 . The orange chat mostly occurs in dry, low-lying, saline environments that are rarely flooded such as sparsely vegetated gibber plains, salt pans, salt lakes, or claypans. They mainly inhabit low, treeless chenopod shrublands dominated by saltbush, bluebush or samphire, with either open or continuous shrub cover.Morcombe, Michael (2003). Field Guide to Australian Birds, p. 273,397. Pascal Press, Glebe. . They are sometimes recorded in other open or shrubby habitats, often near wetlands: low mulga, low buloke woodland; open acacia scrubland; dongas (steep-sided gullies) vegetated with tall shrubs or small trees including mulga, dead finish, belah or sugarwood; grassland; or sedgeland. The orange chat has occasionally been recorded in mallee woodlands and on farmlands, including areas over-run by scotch thistle. Movement The orange chat is nomadic, but less so than the crimson chat, and moves around irregularly. Movements are often determined by weather conditions, which will affect the availability of food in an area. During droughts or dry spells the orange chat will be absent or nearly so from normal habitats and will sometimes be recorded towards the periphery of their usual range. Banding According to the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme, of the 90 orange chats banded in Australia from 1953‚Äì97, none have been recovered. Behaviour The orange chat is gregarious and mobile with undulating flight, but they are also very wary, which does not allow close interactions. They are easy to see from a distance perched atop low bushes, shrubs or trees, due to the vivid orange plumage of the male. Males will often keep watch from a tall shrub or bush whilst the rest of the flock feeds out of sight. Foraging occurs on the ground or from low shrubs. Orange chats are usually seen in pairs or small groups of up to 15 birds, although flocks of more than 400 have been recorded locally. They are often spotted mixing with flocks of crimson and white-fronted chats and seen near or with flocks of zebra finches. When flushed, the orange chat will fly high, briefly perching atop a low shrub before disappearing onto the ground and between shrub cover. At the start of the breeding season flocks disperse into pairs. After the pair has formed, the male accompanies the female at all times until the eggs have been laid and chases other birds, often other males, that approach the pair; this behaviour is rarely seen outside the breeding season. Defensive behaviour Defence of territory is mainly performed by males when breeding; females usually only become involved when the male is absent. Distraction displays From incubation to just after fledging, one or both adults feign injury, flapping along the ground. Sometimes they will not return to their nest while the observer/predator is present. Voice Most calls of the orange chat are a vibrant, metallic twang tang and a softer tchek tchek. Calls do not form a significant part of territorial activity, although the male clicks his bill when flying at intruders; this is often accompanied by a squeak. A soft shu-shu-shu is used by males to call females to them. A louder shu-shu-shu call is used when feigning injury by both sexes. Shu-shu- shu is also used by parents with food to call young. Diet Orange chats mainly eat invertebrates, small insects (ants, bees, wasps, beetles, caterpillars and grasshoppers) and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs. Sometimes they will feed with crimson or white-fronted chats, or with flocks of zebra finches. When water is available, feeding will take place along the water's edge, although they are reported to rarely drink water. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground, occasionally eating seeds. Foraging in crops of sunflowers has been observed. Breeding Breeding habits of the orange chat are not well known, as no major studies have been performed. This species moves and breeds opportunistically throughout the year, sometimes three or more times in response to favourable seasons, whilst breeding will not occur in times of drought. Eggs are laid from June to April, but mostly from August to November; young are seen August‚ÄìNovember and February‚ÄìMay. There is little variation across its range. The female orange chat will build a small but quite substantial nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground in shrubs or herbage, commonly saltbush or samphire. The male will defend both the territory and female during the construction of the nest. Nesting sometimes occurs among pairs of crimson chats but is often solitary or in loose colonies. The nest is neat and cup-shaped, constructed of dry grass, plant stalks, hair, rootlets, feathers, wool, hair, and twigs. Overall dimensions and average nest size (cm), respectively: external diameter, 8.9 and 8.9; external depth, 6.4 and 5.1; internal diameter, 5.1 and 5.7; internal depth, 2.5 and 3.8. Nests are built in samphire or chenopod shrubland, around saltlakes, and occasionally on grass flats or gibber plains. Nests are usually in samphire, saltbush or bluebush; also canegrass, lignum, grass tussocks, sedges or among thistles. They are usually located on or near the top of a live plant, or near the ground under a nest-plant, sheltered from above, or sometimes on the ground. During irruptions, the orange chat nests in a wide variety of shrubs, and there are records of it sometimes nesting in citrus trees. Depending on prevailing conditions, the female lays 3 or 4 whitish oval eggs, which are smooth, close-grained and coloured with brown, red, black and grey spots, especially at the larger end, reminiscent of honeyeaters' eggs. The eggs measure approximately . Both parents help incubate the eggs for around 11 days and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. The fledging period is 10 days. For a few days after fledging, young remain in the nest territory and crouch unmoving under shrubs; after a few days, they will move off with the parents and join local flocks where the young continue to be fed by parents. Predators If a predator approaches the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest and will call loudly during the display. Predators include both introduced and native species: cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds, like ravens and crows.

Life Wynne was born in Maes-y-coed, Caerwys, Flintshire, in north Wales and educated in Northop and at Ruthin School before entering Jesus College in March 1682. He obtained his BA degree in 1685 and was elected a Fellow of the college in January 1687. Subsequently, he was awarded the degrees of MA (1688), BD (1696) and DD (1706). He was chaplain to the 8th Earl of Pembroke, who appointed him rector of Llangelynnin, Merionethshire in 1701 (a post he held until 1714). In 1705, he became prebendary of Christ College, Brecon. He was Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Oxford 1705‚Äì1716. In 1712, he became deputy-principal of Jesus College, being appointed principal in August 1712 after some division between Whig and Tory Fellows (Wynne probably being a moderate Tory at this time), with the help of the college's Visitor, his former employer the Earl of Pembroke. He held onto the post until 1720, despite much grumbling at Oxford after he had been appointed Bishop of St Asaph in 1715 (the first bishop to be created by King George I). He became Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1727, as a compromise candidate, and remained there until his death in 1743. Whilst at St Asaph, he raised ¬£600 for repairs to the cathedral. He was one of the few Welshmen to be appointed as bishop of a Welsh diocese during the eighteenth century (and was the last Welsh bishop of St Asaph before 1870) and gained a reputation as a diligent bishop and one who appointed local men to parishes. He published only three of his sermons and, in 1696, an abridgment of John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, with Locke's approval, which was translated into French and Italian. In 1732, in light of a debt, Edward Conway sold the Soughton Hall estate in Flintshire to Wynne. He planted extensively in the wider house grounds, including three well-preserved Lime tree avenues including the almost-complete one which still flanks the approach to the house. After his death it passed to his daughter Margaret, wife of Henry Bankes of Corfe Castle, Dorset.

Australian Bird Names; a complete guide. CSIRO Publishing. p. 208. . The specific epithet crocea is from Latin croceus 'golden-yellow'.

Description The yellow chat is a small passerine bird usually seen in groups of 2-10 individuals.Jaensch, R. (2004). \\"Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea in natural wetlands of the Georgina and Diamantina channel country.\\" The Sunbird 34(2): 58-66. They are approximately tall and weigh . They are sexually dimorphic with the adult male having a bright golden-yellow forehead and underparts with a prominent black crescent breast band.Flegg, J. (2002). Photographic Field Guide: Birds of Australia. New Holland, Frenchs Forest, NSW. The crown and nape are a grey-olive colour, the back is yellowish-brown and the tail is black with yellow tips on the feathers. The female is of similar colouring to the male but with a paler yellow colour and with no breast band.Pizzey, G. and Knight, F. (2000). Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Harper Collins Publishers, Sydney, NSW. The juveniles are distinguished by being more greyish-brown in colour than the yellow displayed by their parents. All yellow chats, including juveniles, have a distinctive yellow rump when in flight. They have relatively long legs and toes, allowing them to forage with ease for food over low vegetation and on the ground. Yellow chats can also be identified by their distinctive, high-pitched and tuneful pee pee call.Jaensch, R., Pedler, L., Carpenter, G., and Black, A. (2013). \\"Records of the golden-headed cisticola, yellow chat, tawny grassbird and eastern grass owl in the channel country following several wet years.\\" The Sunbird 43: 1-11. Distribution and habitat The yellow chat occurs patchily throughout northern Australia, ranging across the arid zone from north-eastern South Australia and south-western Queensland to the north-west of the Northern Territory. There are some isolated populations in eastern Queensland and in north-west Western Australia.Beruldsen, G. (2003). Australian Birds: their Nests and Eggs. Phoenix Offset, China. Their habitat is subject to high temperatures for most of the year and contains marshy plains vegetated with saltbush, rank grasses, or cumbungi reeds. These marshes have been formed by marine lagoons or inland artesian bore drains, creating a saline environment. This distribution includes the central arid region and the hot, subhumid monsoonal region. Most of the annual rainfall falls during the summer monsoon, leaving the remaining six months of the year with little rainfall. Arid zone adaptations It has been presumed that yellow chats would encounter problems living in their harsh, arid environment with high ambient temperatures, low ambient humidities and small amounts of surface water. Birds with small body weights are predicted to have high metabolic rates.Lasiewski, R. C., and Dawson, W. R. (1967). \\"A re-examination of the relation between standard metabolic rate and body weight in birds.\\" Condor 13-23. Furthermore, small body weights will also lead to a higher rate of evaporative water loss compared to larger birds.Crawford, E. C., and Lasiewski, R. C. (1968). \\"Oxygen consumption and respiratory evaporation of the emu and rhea.\\" Condor 333-339. These predictions suggest that the small body size of the yellow chats combined with their hot, dry, arid environment will result in heat stress and a high loss of water. This could be detrimental in their habitat where water is scarce. Despite these predictions, yellow chats are able to prosper in their hot, arid habitat. Studies have found that the physiology of the yellow chats differs from other species of passerines with adaptations to help them cope with the challenging environment. Studies have shown that they are able to reduce their metabolic rate and evaporative water loss. The metabolic rate is mostly controlled by the concentration of thyroid hormone.Collins, K.J. and Weiner, J. S. (1968). \\"Endocrinological aspects of exposure to high environmental temperatures.\\" Physiological Review 48: 785-839. Yellow chats have adapted to have lower levels of this hormone circulating in their body, resulting in a slower metabolism. This adaptation enables them to thrive in their harsh hot and dry environment. Another suggested adaptation to help yellow chats survive in the arid region is their brush tongue. The brush tongue may be an adaptation to aid in retrieving drinking water. It allows the birds access to dew and the capability to drink thin water films, such as water seepages on surfaces of plants. Furthermore, the colour of their plumage is an adaptation aiding in their thermoregulation. Black pigments have been observed to increase heat absorption, with lighter colours absorbing less heat.Margalida, A., Negro, J. J., and Galv√°n, I. (2008). \\"\\"Melanin-based color variation in the bearded vulture suggests a thermoregulatory function.\\" Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology 149: 87-91. This suggests that the yellow colouring of the yellow chats is an adaptation to reduce the amount of heat absorbed in their body. Behaviour Diet The yellow chat is a predominately insectivorous bird. They scavenge for their food in damp substrates, low vegetation or in shallow water.Houston, W., Porter, G., Elder, R., Black, R., and Sheaves, M. (2004). \\"Rediscovery of yellow chats (Capricorn subspecies) on the Fitzroy River delta central Queensland.\\" The Sunbird 34: 36-42. Breeding Epthianura crocea crocea eggs Breeding season for the yellow chat has been observed from November to January after sufficient rain has fallen.Reynolds, I. S., Walter, J. C., and Woodall, P. F. (1982). \\"Observations on yellow chats' Ephthianura crocea'in western Queensland.\\" The Sunbird 12: 21-30. At the beginning of the breeding season, the flocks disperse and male-female pairs form. The male follows his mate until egg-laying commences.Williams, C. K. (1979). \\"Ecology of Australian chats (Epthianura Gould): Reproduction in aridity.\\" Australian Journal of Zoology 27: 213-229. The male defends their breeding territory by bill-clicking and chasing intruders. The female builds the nest close to the ground in small shrubs, usually samphire (Tecticornia) or in dense grass. The nests are made from vegetation such as fine twigs, rootlets, and grasses. The inside of the cup is lined with hair, usually horse or cow, and fine grasses. The female lays a clutch of two or three white to pinkish-white eggs, measuring and marked with some reddish-brown splotches.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. Incubation of the eggs is approximately two weeks and alternates between the male and female.Jaensch, R., Houston, W., Black, R., Campbell, L., McCabe, J., Elder, R., and Porter, G.

It is the only member of the genus Tachuris and is sometimes placed in a separate monotypic family. It inhabits marshland and reedbeds around lakes and rivers. It is particularly associated with stands of Scirpus. The nest is built among plant stems.Jaramillo, Alvaro; Burke, Peter & Beadle, David (2003) Field Guide to the Birds of Chile. Christopher Helm, London. Taxonomy and systematics A 2013 DNA-based study of South American suboscines found that the many-colored rush tyrant belonged to an isolated lineage that had been separated from other suboscines for around 25 million years. The authors proposed that it would be better placed in its own monotypic family Tachurididae. It was subsequently suggested that the name should be Tachurisidae. The placement in a separate family was followed by Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of the Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World, but has not yet been adopted by other authorities. Four subspecies are recognised. The nominate T. r. rubrigastra is the most widespread, occurring from south-east Brazil to southern Argentina and central Chile, T. r. alticola is found in the Andes of south-east Peru, west Bolivia and north-west Argentina, T. r. libertatis is found in coastal Peru while T. r. loaensis is restricted to Antofagasta Region in northern Chile. Description Many-colored rush tyrant nest The many- colored rush tyrant is a small bird, in length. As the bird's name suggests, the plumage is very colourful. The back and rump are green while the underparts are yellow apart from the white throat, black breastband and red undertail-coverts. The face is dark blue-grey, there is a yellow stripe over the eye and the crown is dark with a red patch that is often concealed. The wings and tail are dark with a white wingbar and white outer tail-feathers. Females are duller than the males.

The flitting of the tail is characteristic of this species, but also of some near relatives. Taxonomy Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the white-browed scrub robin in 1817.

The pale supercilliary stripe is distinct, and the crown may be warm brown, olive brown or greyish brown. The wings are dusky but well- marked. Greater and lesser wing coverts always white-tipped, but the secondaries with or without white edging. Amount of streaking on the breast is very variable, in subsp. ovamboensis it is reduced to fine streaking encircling the throat. The breast and flanks are washed with a variable amount of tawny buff. The mantle and back is brownish to hazel or rufous, depending on the subspecies. The tail is greyish brown to rufous, with a black subterminal band and white feather tips and corners. Juveniles are mottled but with the tail pattern of adults. Distribution and habitat The white-browed scrub robin is found in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Its range spans tropical, subtropical and temperate latitudes. It is present and usually common in any mesic to arid woodland or savanna, provided that there is cover, open scrub or thickets. In the Eastern Highlands it is only present up to 1,400 metres, and in East Africa up to 1,500 metres. It is replaced on the Kalahari sands by the Kalahari scrub robin, while in the Horn of Africa it is sympatric with the rufous bush chat, which lacks any white in the wings. Suitable habitat is usually grassy, which facilitates nesting. Behaviour Visiting termite galleries Sedentary except in the far south. A restless but shy species which mostly sings from concealment inside bushes. It hops on the ground when foraging. As with some other scrub robin species, the tail is regularly flicked and fanned, and the wings may be drooped. The alarm is a sharp skirr or skee-ip note. The loud and variable song may include countless, sometimes identical repetitions. The songs of the respective subspecies are believed to be distinguishable, and those of the 'white-winged' group are considered to be shriller. It feeds on insects, especially termites and ants. Breeding Pairs are monogamous and nest solitarily from early to midsummer. The nest is built from dry grass by the female only, and is placed some 10 to 20 cm up at the heart of a grass tuft. Usually three eggs are laid and these are incubated by the female only. The cream-coloured eggs, measuring 20 x 14 mm, are blotched with brown and purple around the thicker end. The chicks are reared by both parents. Some nests are parasitised by cuckoos.

It is sometimes known as the sandy scrub robin. Range It is found in southern Angola, Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, and Zimbabwe, where it occurs in sandveld with low trees and scrub, on the edges of woodland, and in savanna. It will also inhabit human-altered environments including old fields and gardens. The species is common and not considered threatened by human activities. Breeding The Kalahari scrub robin is a seasonal breeder, with the season stretching from August to February, and peaking in November, also the peak of the wet season. The species is monogamous and territorial, with territory sizes varying from 0.7 - 4.3 ha. Females are responsible for constructing the nest, which are weaved of shrubs and grasses and placed in low thorny bushes. The nest building stage takes around 5 days. The average clutch size is about two, although clutch size is bigger later in the season. Only the female incubates the eggs, the male defends the nest, aggressively attacking intruders and warning when predators approach. The incubation lasts around 12 days. Having hatched the female removes the eggshells from the nests and drops them away from the nest to disguise the nest from potential predators. After hatching the female broods the chicks for a between 3‚Äì7 days. Both parents feed the chicks and remove the chick's faecal sacs. The chicks are altricial when they hatch, and take around 12 days to fledge. File:Kalahari scrub robin, Erythropygia paena at Pilanesberg National Park, Northwest Province, South Africa.

It forms a superspecies with the forest scrub robin, miombo scrub robin and brown scrub robin. These four species are sometimes placed in the genus Tychaedon. Two subspecies of C. quadrivirgata are recognized: C. q. greenwayi in the Zanzibar and Mafia Islands, and C. q. quadrivirgata in the rest of the range. The specific epithet quadrivirgata means \\"four-striped\\" in Latin. The species is so named because of four diagnostic stripes on its face.

On 1 December, 1981, the flight crashed on Corsica's Mont San-Pietro, killing all 180 people on board. The crash was the deadliest and first major aviation accident involving a McDonnell Douglas MD-80.  Preceding events  On October 22, 1981, Inex-Adria sent a request to authorize the charter flight, which received the number JP-1308, from Ljubljana to Ajaccio and back, on 1 December of the same year. The flight was chartered by the Slovenian travel agency Kompas, based in Ljubljana. The application terms stated that flight 1308 would use a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft with a seating capacity of 115 to 135. The permit was issued by the General Directorate of Civil Aviation on 16 November. However, the airline decided to not use the DC-9 and instead decided to use the McDonnell Douglas MD-81 as it was a newer and larger aircraft. The application originally indicated the flight would carry 130 passengers, however, there were an additional 43 passengers on board who were Inex-Adria employees, Kompas tourists, and/or their families which totaled up to 173 passengers. As the crew consisted of seven people, there were a total of 180 people on board.  Aircraft  The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 registered in Yugoslavia as YU-ANA (manufacturers serial number 48047). The aircraft's first flight was 15 May 1981. The aircraft was delivered to Inex-Adria on 11 August. The aircraft only had 683 flying hours at the time of the accident. The last A-check on the aircraft was performed on 7 November 1981. The last maintenance test of the aircraft took place four days before the accident, on 27 November. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-217 turbofan engines (numbers P708403D and P708404D), each developing 20,850 pounds of thrust and having a total operating time of 683 hours, recorded since check A-47.  Crew  The captain was 55-year-old Ivan Kunovic. He received his pilot license for the jets on 16 April 1968 at the Yugoslav Academy of the Air Force in Zadar and was qualified to fly the F-84, T-33 and F-86. Kunovic was left JRV in rank of Capitan soon after that was hired by Inex-Adria in 1970 and became a first officer on the DC-9 the same year. He then became a captain of the DC-9 (32 and 50 series) on 4 April 1972 and then an MD-80 captain on 13 August 1981 after spent 3 months on cpt.course in USA . At the time of the disaster, Kunovic had a total of 12,123 flight hours, including 5,675 hours on the DC-9 and 188 hours on the MD-81. The co- pilot was 40-year-old M. Franc Terglav. He was initially qualified to pilot flights in the JRV school for the reserve pilots (≈†RVO 14 kl.in 1962) He was flying on the Aero 3, Soko 522 and later civilian Piper PA-31, PA-34 and Cessna Citation. He was pilot for the Slovenian company Gorenje. Soon after he has got job for the pilot in the Inex adria he starts fling DC-9 (32 and 50 srs) On 21 June 1981, he graduated to first officer on the MD-81 and he received his commercial pilots license on 11 November 1981. Terglav had a total of 4,213 flight hours, including 746 hours on the DC-9 (which were accumulated during 529 flights), and 288 hours on the MD-81.  Accident  Flight 1308 took off from Brnik Airport on a chartered flight from SR Slovenia, SFR Yugoslavia to Corsica's capital city of Ajaccio with 173 Slovenian tourists and 7 crew members. At 08:08, the airliner was in Italian airspace when the controller in Padua contacted a colleague in Ajaccio and requested the actual weather report. The southwest (240¬∞) moderate wind was blowing at the airport at that time , and the sky was covered with separate clouds. When the crew received weather reports, it decided to land on runway 03, while the captain clarified that if the wind increased, they would fly around for inspection. At 07:28 the plane entered the zone of the control center in Rome and the flight was cleared to descend to flight level FL 270 (. The crew clarified whether or not they were cleared to descend. The controller told the crew that they were not cleared, and the crew acknowledged the transmission, thanking the controller. At 08:31, the controller again cleared flight 1308 to descend to FL 270, to which this time the crew confirmed, and reporting that they were leaving FL 330 and beginning to descend. The controller also clarified that the flight would be cleared to descend to FL 190 () after passing Elbe. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded a sound similar to the activation of the ‚ÄúFasten seat belt‚Äù sign and captain Kunovic instructed first officer Terglav to calculate the landing parameters. A flight attendant entered the cockpit and asked to reduce the temperature in the cabin, which the first officer did. At 08:33, the controller cleared flight 1308 to descend to tier 190 at Bastia. After re-checking the calculations, the commander and co-pilot, based on the adjusted mass and pressure, determined the approach speeds as 221, 170, 148 and 124 knots (409, 315, 274 and 230 km/h; 254, 195, 170, and 142 mph). At some point, first officer Terglav let his young son enter the cockpit, as a child‚Äôs voice was heard asking when the aircraft would descend. At 08:35, the crew entered the air traffic control space in Marseille and subsequently established radio contact at 08:35:50, reporting the passage of flight level (FL) 210 and descending to 190 in the direction of Ajaccio, after which he requested permission for a further reduction. In response, the controller instructed them to maintain FL 190 to Bastia and to \\"squawk\\" 5200 on its transponder, since the direct route to Ajaccio slightly went through the closed LFR 65 airspace, and this maneuver would bypass it. At 08:40:35, the crew reported on staying at FL 190 50 miles from Ajaccio and again requested permission to descend, to which the controller cleared them to descend to FL 110 (11 thousand feet or 3,350 meters). Giving permission to descend, the controller used non-standard terminology, \\"cleared down 110\\", to which the crew later discussed in the cockpit. Then the crew studied the approach procedure for the course-glide system on runway 03. In this process, during the preparatory preparation, the child intervened twice, who spoke about observing a mountain similar to Servin; according to the investigation, it was of the Monte Chinto array. Focusing on the level of the airport, which is , the crew set the decision height to . At 08:43:57 the captain reported reaching FL 110 at a distance of 28 miles and on a VOR Ajaccio. Further, at 08:47:10, the commander contacted the Ajaccio approach controller, who reported that flight 1308 would be landing on runway 21, instructed to keep 110 on the VOR Ajaccio and passed the weather report: atmospheric pressure 1009, airfield pressure 1008, wind 280¬∞ at . When at 08:49:31 captain Kunovic reported on the VOR flight at an altitude of 110, and was instructed to change the heading to 247¬∞, and at 08:49:52 - to descend to FL 33 , although due to interference the crew heard the height as . Due to the fact that there was no radar at the airport at that time, the controller determined the location of the aircraft only according to reports from the crew. At 08:50:05 the crew reported on the beginning of the decline. By that time, the instrument speed was reduced from 285 to 224 knots, when the airliner began to descend with a vertical speed of , and the instrumental speed increased to . At 08:52:15 the crew reported passing FL 60 () and asked to turn on the radio beacon, which would be the flight's last transmission. At 08:53:08, the controller instructed the crew to correct the heading, but received no response. At 08:53:21, a four-second whistle sounded in the control room. The crew did not respond. Starting from 08:52:43, the flight recorders recorded the aircraft flying above mountain peaks that were 1000 and 2500 feet tall, and from 08:52:26 turbulent flows also began to appear and increased. Further, at 08:53:08, the aircraft's Ground Proximity Warning System gave off several audio warnings, which the crew did not react to for approximately ten seconds. Three seconds before impact, the crew increased engine power and attempted to climb, but were unable to clear the terrain. Left aircraft's wing collided with the summit of Mont San-Pietro and 6m broke off. The aircraft then went into an uncontrolled dive and violently crashed on the other side of the mountain eight seconds later, killing everyone on board. The time of the accident was 8:53 a.m. local time (07:53 UTC).  Search  Petreto-Bicchisano church, where the body identification took place At 9 am, seven minutes after losing contact with flight 1308, an emergency search began. the controller mistakenly believed that flight 1308 crashed at sea. Finally, at 12:40, a wing fragment was found on the top of Mount San Pietro, from the coast. The next day the rescuers reached the crash site, only to find that there were no survivors.  Investigation  The subsequent investigation into the disaster revealed that control mistakenly believed that Flight 1308 was out of its holding pattern, believing it was already located over the sea, while in reality it was located inland, over the mountainous terrain of Corsica. The crew, apparently surprised at the instruction to descend, repeated several times that they were still in the holding pattern, which the control acknowledged. The crew was unfamiliar with the airport and its vicinity, as this was the first flight of Inex-Adria Aviopromet to Corsica. The investigation determined that the imprecise language used by the crew of the MD-81 and the air traffic controller played a significant role in the accident. Air traffic control in Ajaccio was cleared of all charges. The air traffic controller in charge of Flight 1308 was transferred to another airport in France. At the time of the accident, the Ajaccio airport had no radar system. As a direct result of the accident, the equipment was upgraded and the approach pattern changed.  2008 clean-up operation  Some debris and human bodies were removed from the crash site after the accident in 1981. In 2007, POP TV (a TV station in Slovenia) did a news report on the accident. They visited the crash site in Corsica and found many of the airplane's parts still scattered on Mont San-Pietro, in rugged and inaccessible terrain. Subsequently, the Government of Slovenia, Adria Airways and Kompas (the Slovenian travel agency that organized the fatal trip in 1981) organized and funded a clean-up operation. A Slovenian team of about 60 soldiers, mountain rescuers, civil protection and rescue service members, medical personnel, and other volunteers removed about 27 tons of aircraft remains in May 2008. The removed debris included one aircraft engine and large wing parts. Some of the parts were so large they needed to be machine cut before transporting them from the mountain by a helicopter. Several human remains were also found, and were either sent for further identification tests, or were properly disposed. A commemorative plaque was installed at the site of the initial wing impact.

Today, several artists live in a dedicated art center at Gugging, known as the Art Brut Center Gugging, which also includes the Museum Gugging and the Gallery Gugging. In stark contrast, Gugging has a darkened history during the time of the Nazi Regime, when hundreds of mental patients were murdered or abused as part of the Nazi Regime Euthanasia Program. History during the Nazi regime Historian Herwig Czech told the Austrian Press Agency that Gugging was the scene ‚Äúof some of the most barbarous medical crimes committed in Austria‚Äù during the Nazi Regime. Approximately 400 patients were killed by Doctor Emil Gelny by poisoning and electric shock. Rudolf Lonauer was the attending doctor for 112 deaths and typically murdered his patients - mainly women - with an overdose of drugs. Patients also died from lethal injection, malnutrition, and infectious diseases. New research has also shown that between November 1940 and May 1941 a total of 675 people were taken from the clinic to the euthanasia center at Hartheim castle near Linz, where they were gassed. Of these, 116 were children and teenagers between the ages of four and 17. By 1940, rumors of euthanasia at Hartheim began to spread. Anna W√∂dl, a nurse and the mother of a disabled child living at Gugging, attempted to save the life of her son by petitioning against his relocation to Hartheim. She was assured that he would not go to Hartheim, but was instead taken to another children's institution, Am Spiegelgrund, where he died soon after he arrived. The Gugging Artists In the late 1950s, psychiatrist Leo Navratil (1921-2006), of the Maria Gugging Psychiatric Clinic, had his patients produce drawings for diagnostic purposes. The following year he discovered artistically talented individuals in his ward - a finding that was confirmed by Jean Dubuffet, the French artist who coined the term Art Brut (also known as Outsider Art). Navratil's first book Schizophrenie und Kunst (Schizophrenia and Art) was published in 1965. Attracted to the clinic by this work, many Viennese artists visited Gugging. In 1970 the first exhibition of the \\"Gugging Artists\\" took place in a Vienna gallery. Thereafter, the \\"Gugging Artists\\" were frequently presented in galleries and museums. House of Artists Tiled art in the clinic grounds The \\"Center for Art and Psychotherapy\\" was founded by Navratil in 1981. He invited artistically talented patients to live in the house, which serves as living space, studio, gallery and meeting place. With the founder's retirement in 1986, Johann Feilacher became his successor. Feilacher stressed the role that art played at Gugging and went on to change its name to the \\"House of Artists\\" (). Within Europe, the House of Artists is regarded as a model for psychiatric reforms based on art therapy as a means to reintegrate clients into society. Presently, a cultural center is located next to the House of Artists. It is known as the \\"Art / Brut Center\\", and consists of a museum, a gallery and a public studio. The museum contains the works of the Gugging artists, and also hosts traveling Art Brut exhibitions, which include artists such as Martin Ramirez and Adolf W√∂lfli. The museum building also hosts a public studio that is open to all, but is mainly used by individuals who have undergone or are receiving psychiatric treatment. Together the museum, the gallery, the \\"House of Artists\\" and the public studio, are known as the Art / Brut Center Gugging. In popular culture In early 1994 David Bowie and Brian Eno visited the Gugging psychiatric hospital to interview and photograph the celebrated artist-patients famous for their \\"Outsider Art\\". Artistic materials favored by the Gugging's residents had a powerful influence on production strategies in the studio during the Bowie / Eno collaboration. In March 1994 a three-hour piece (mostly dialog) further inspired the process of the 1995 concept album Outside. Philipp Weiss's Ein sch√∂ner Hase ist meistens der Einzellne is based on the real life story of Ernst Herbeck (1920 - 1991) and August Walla (1936 - 2001), two schizophrenic artistic patients of Gugging. Projekttheater Vorarlberg performed a production of the play at Alte Hallenbad Feldkirch from December 2013.

A few countries bring their own official state car for state visits to other countries, for instance, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and South Korea. It also may serve as an automotive symbol of the head of state and their country. Part of the criteria for an official state car is to have adequate security, capability and stateliness for its duty. A limousine, executive car, or sport utility vehicle is usually selected. Due to the high security risk of the passengers, these vehicles are often heavily secured and protected. Vehicles may be armoured by the manufacturer or an after-market specialist. (In this article the term \\"armored car\\" invariably means a reinforced civilian vehicle, not the military vehicle). When carrying an important passenger, state vehicles may be surrounded by a motorcade consisting of police or military personnel. The vehicle's driver might also be from the law enforcement or military pool; the driver of the United States Presidential State Car is an experienced agent from the Secret Service and the British prime minister is driven by a Specialist Protection officer from the Metropolitan Police Service. For state visits and international conferences, the host country usually supplies the ground transportation and security personnel. However, a few countries transport their official state cars to the destination. In some cases state cars may bear standard number plates; in others special or no plates are used.  Sourcing  In countries that have indigenous automobile manufacturers, the government will usually commission one of the national automakers to provide a state car, or allow several to provide cars for an official state fleet. It is considered an honour for a car manufacturer to be selected to provide a state car for their respective country and a demonstration of the confidence of a government in their national industry. For example, the president of the United States currently uses a Cadillac with special undisclosed security features commissioned by the United States government and built by General Motors, with Lincoln, manufactured by Ford Motor Company and Chrysler vehicles having been used in the past, representing the three major American manufacturers. Soviet leaders used the custom-built limousines by the ZiL company, and though the Russian presidents have switched to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class due to ZiL's decline after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Putin has commissioned a new official state car from the national automotive establishment, which was delivered in early 2018. In 2018 the Government of South Korea had commissioned a highly modified Hyundai Nexo SUV to serve as the official state car of South Korea. The emperor of Japan uses a Toyota Century, the prime minister of Italy uses a Maserati, the prime minister of Malaysia uses a Proton Perdana, the president of the Czech Republic rides a ≈†koda Superb, and the British monarch uses a Bentley. Members of the British royal family are driven in Jaguars, though other makes may be used in other Commonwealth realms. The president of France can choose from cars manufactured by Renault or PSA Peugeot Citro√´n, and all major German manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen Group) are represented in Germany's pool of vehicles available for use by state officials. The prime minister of India uses a Land Rover Sentinel high security edition as Jaguar and Land Rover is owned by Tata Motors, an Indian automobile company though they are manufactured in the UK. For countries without major indigenous manufacturers, an official state car may be purchased from a suitable manufacturer in a nation with strong economic and diplomatic ties. Canada exclusively uses state cars manufactured by the Detroit Three, many of which are made in Canadian factories, with the United States and American car manufacturers having a historically strong relationship with Canada. Countries The following information lists some state cars and their users of sovereign states and other territories; the list is likely to be out of date in some cases as incumbents and cars change.  Afghanistan  The president of Afghanistan travels in a convoy of armored Toyota Land Cruiser J200s without registration plates.  Albania  The current president of Albania rides in his Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman, escorted by a motorcade consisting of black Fiat 500Ls.  Argentina  The president of Argentina Alberto Fern√°ndez uses the Toyota Corolla accompanied by Presidential Security that are using 4√ó4 Toyota Hilux SW4.  Armenia  The current president of Armenia rides in an Audi A8, escorted by a motorcade consisting of black Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUVs.  Australia   Governor-general and state governors  The Rolls-Royce Phantom VI used as the ceremonial state car by the governor-general of Australia. The governor-general of Australia travels in a Rolls-Royce Phantom VI limousine for ceremonial occasions, such as the State Opening of Parliament. He more commonly uses a white ballistic and bullet-proof armoured BMW 7 series when on official business. The official cars of the governor-general fly the flag of the governor-general of Australia and display St. Edward's Crown instead of number plates. A similar arrangement is used for the governors of the six states. When the queen is in Australia, the queen's personal Australian flag is flown on the car in which she is travelling. During Queen Elizabeth II's 2011 visit to Australia, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were driven in a Range Rover Vogue.  Prime minister  prime ministerial limousine carries the number plate C1. The official state car of the prime minister of Australia is a white ballistic and bullet- proof armoured BMW 7 Series, supported at all times by an armoured BMW X5. Prior to 2013, vehicles in the prime ministerial fleet were white Ford Territory and Holden Caprice models. The prime ministerial vehicle is also escorted by police vehicles from state and federal authorities. The prime minister's car bears the number plate C1 (meaning \\"Commonwealth One\\") and a centrally mounted Australian flag. The prime ministerial car fleet operates as part of COMCAR, a division of the Australian Government's Department of Finance. In 2013, BMW was selected to provide a fleet of 7 Series High Security vehicles as part of a tender to replace the ageing armoured Holden Caprice fleet that formerly transported the Australian prime minister. The off-the-shelf replacements offer greater protection and better value for money. A BAE and GM-Holden Consortium also bid for the contract.  Austria  Senior government figures in Austria use Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class models.  Azerbaijan  President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev travels in an armored Maybach 62 limousine. Sometimes he uses a heavy armored, custom-built Mercedes-Benz W221 S600 Guard Pullman.  Bangladesh  The prime minister of Bangladesh rides in an armored BMW 7 Series, as well as an armored Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV. Previously, the car would be a Nissan Armada SUV.  Belgium  King Philippe in a BMW 7 Series The Belgian king, Philippe, uses a Mercedes-Benz S-Class or a BMW 7 Series, mostly with the number plate '1', because he is the commander in chief of the army. For his inauguration, a Mercedes-Benz 600 landaulette was used. All royal family members drive cars with only numbers. The prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, uses an Audi A6. Federal government officials drive cars with number plates starting with an \\"A\\" followed by one to three numbers. Regional government officials drive cars with number plates starting with an \\"E\\" followed by one to three numbers. Members of parliament and the senate drive cars with number plates starting with a \\"P\\" followed by three numbers. For personal use, Queen Paola of Belgium drives a Fiat 500 with diplomatic plates. Prince Laurent of Belgium is famous for his speed driving and his fast cars. There is also a Mercedes-Benz 600 and a 1965 Lincoln Continental Convertible in the royal garage. The late Baudouin of Belgium ordered in the 1970s an armored De Tomaso Deauville. He had also an Aston Martin DB2/4. For their marriage in 1960, Baudouin and Fabiola used a 1955 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible, with a bulletproof bubble-top.  Belize  The governor- general of Belize and the prime minister of Belize are both driven in a Volvo S80 bearing the Belizean flag and the standard of that office. Ministers generally use a black Toyota Prado, bearing either government plates or civilian plates with tags.  Bhutan  The king of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, is driven in a Lexus SUV and occasionally in a BMW M5, in an escort led by the Royal Bodyguard in a Jeep Wrangler followed by Toyota Land Cruisers and Hiluxes.  Bolivia  The president of Bolivia is driven in an armoured Lexus LS 460L and escorted by four Toyota Land Cruisers.  Brazil  Dilma Rousseff rides in the ceremonial state car, the Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith during the Independence Day parade. The ceremonial state car of the president of Brazil is a 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith, reserved exclusively for Independence Day commemorations, state visits and the presidential inauguration. The current official state car used by the president for regular transportation is a 2011-model armored version of the Ford Fusion Hybrid. The car is also used as escort car for the presidential motorcade. The Fusion was first used on 17 June 2008 when it replaced a 2004 Chevrolet Omega. In February 2012 the Brazilian government bought 12 Canadian- built Ford Edge models, 10 of which armored, for the use of President Dilma Rousseff and her security team. The federal government's most important officials (President, ministers, magistrates, etc.) use yellow-green brass plates adorned with the coat of arms of Brazil and their titles engraved on them (e.g., President of the Republic, President of the Senate, Defense Minister, Supreme Court president, etc.).  Brunei  The ceremonial state car of the sultan of Brunei is a 1992 state landaulette Rolls-Royce Phantom VI. On non-ceremonial occasions, the sultan of Brunei personally drives a black Mercedes-Benz M-Class W163 ML55 AMG, usually escorted by either a Secret Service BMW E39 540i or a BMW E61 545i, and a few Lexus LX470. Recently, the Sultan drives around in a black Brabus G700. On other occasions he drives a Maybach 62. The sultan and his brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah own several luxury and exotic cars, one of the largest collections in the world. Queen Saleha of Brunei is usually driven around in a 2012 Rolls Royce Phantom Series II. The members of the royal family are usually escorted by a Secret Service escort of Volvo S80 V8 models, or Mitsubishi 380. The cabinet ministers of Brunei and visiting foreign dignitaries are driven in a black Mercedes Benz W221 S350L, while other senior ranking officials are driven in a black Mercedes Benz W211 E280. The sultan drives a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, the 2009 Facelifted G55 AMG instead of the W163 ML55 AMG.  Bulgaria  The cars of the president of Bulgaria include Mercedes-Benz S600 and BMW 5 Series and BMW 7 Series. The prime minister is driven in a Toyota Land Cruiser, he very often drives it himself with the security guards sitting in the back of the car. The prime minister is also driven in a black BMW X5. The pilot cars are usually Ford, Toyota or Audi A6 and Audi A8. As of 18 December, the prime minister and the president of Bulgaria are transported in a top of the line Mercedes S600 Guard, 517 hp. Cambodia The royal king of Cambodia Norodom Sihamoni is driven in a black Mercedes S-Class 600 with the Royal Palace plate number and the logo of Royal Standard of the King of Cambodia behind. The king has owned two black Mercedes-Benz 600s and also a black Lexus SUV and uses an armoured Range Rover Sentinel stretch for his visits to provinces and rural area. The prime minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia has owned more than four Mercedes- Benz guard cars and more than five Chevrolet Suburbans in his houses. He also had a black Mercedes-Benz S-Class 600 Carat Duchatelet bullet proof with plate number \`2Z-9999\` and another black Mercedes-Benz S600 (V221) with plate number \`2AA-9999\` and two gold Mercedes-Benz S600 (W220)s. Cameroon The president of Cameroon, Paul Biya, uses an armoured Range Rover Sentinel as his official car. Other vehicles forming part of his motorcade include Toyota Land Cruiser's which transport his security detail.  Canada  Motorcade of Queen Elizabeth II in Winnipeg in 2010. The queen's car (second in line) is a Lincoln Town Car bearing her Canadian royal standard, with a licence plate displaying a gold St. Edward's Crown on a red field. The monarch of Canada and governor general of Canada are driven in a Lincoln Town Car or a Lincoln MKS, with the appropriate flag of office on a metal flagstaff affixed to the right- side front fender. The sovereign's car bears a licence plate with a gold St. Edward's Crown on a red field. The governor general's car bears a standard licence plate of the province of Ontario, but the car displays the governor general's flag to distinguish it. The governor general has also been driven in a Chevrolet Suburban or at times in a Cadillac DTS stretched limousine. A Toyota Highlander Hybrid has also been available for use by governors general. All vehicle are from the VIP fleet of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The prime minister of Canada is driven in a motorcade of five vehicles or more. The motorcade's size is adjusted for certain events, as seen fit by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The prime minister usually rides in an armoured Chevrolet Suburban or long-wheelbase Cadillac DTS, but he has also been seen arriving at various events in a Toyota Sienna minivan when travelling with members of his family. The prime minister's vehicle bears a standard Ontario licence plate. The motorcade is usually led by a Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, or Mercury Grand Marquis sedan. Certain government ministers and officials are driven in Chrysler 300 sedans. There is also a Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid for official transportation.  Chile  The Ford Galaxie has been Chile's ceremonial presidential car since 1970. Official ceremonial vehicle The president of Chile traditionally used an elegant horse drawn \\"Bandeja\\" Carriage imported from France by President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda for ceremonial events until president Salvador Allende, not wanting to project the image of royalty that carriages now confer, acquired a used 1966 black Ford Galaxie XL convertible in 1970 for Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Chile. Allende then used the vehicle as his official vehicle, with a normally issued license plate (EL-2801). Both the carriage and the Galaxie have since been maintained by the state and are now used only for official ceremonies, such as state visits and the national holidays on 21 May and 19 September. Daily transportation Pi√±era departs from La Moneda Palace in a Genesis G90 President Ricardo Lagos used a Lincoln Town Car, while President Michelle Bachelet introduced a 2008-model Peugeot 607 saloon in her first term in office. Her motorcade was also often seen driving 2006 Audi A4 and A6s. Various Dodge Durangos also composed the presidential motorcade. During his first term, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era used a Lexus LS 600h as his daily transport. Bachelet introduced the use of a Hyundai Equus in 2014 for her second term, a marque that has continued into Pi√±era's second term in 2018 with his choice of the Genesis G90. Whether Pi√±era's G90 is comparable to South Korean president Moon Jae-in's bulletproof and customized Genesis EQ900 Limousine or a standard issue G90 is unknown. La Moneda staff accompanies President Pi√±era in Hyundai Santa Fe chase vehicles, reflecting Hyundai's market share in Chile, consistently holding the top position in sales.  People's Republic of China  Former state cars at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution. The ≈†koda VOS to the left was used by Zhu De, while the ZIS-110 to the right was used by Mao Zedong. Before production began of the Hongqi, Chinese leaders used various foreign luxury cars. For example, Chairman Mao Zedong used a bullet-proofed ZIS-115 donated by Stalin, while Premier Zhou Enlai used a GAZ-12 ZIM, later a ZIL-115 and Foreign Minister Chen Yi used a Mercedes Benz 600 Pullman before Hongqi began production of its CA770. Since the 1960s Chinese leaders have traditionally used limousines produced under the Hongqi brand for official events. Before the new Hongqi HQE (official name L9) was introduced, the Chinese leaders used a special version of CA770 limousine to review the troops on National Days. During former leader Hu Jintao's review of troops on National Day in 2009, he was seen in a Hongqi HQE Limousine. The HQE is powered by an aluminium V12 cylinder engine of Chinese design (designation CA12VG), with a displacement of 6.0 liters and producing 370 kW (470 hp) at 5600 rpm and 550 N m (405 lb¬∑ft) of torque at 4400 rpm. It is bulletproof, completely hand built and comes with run-flat tyres. When the Kuomintang was still in power, Provisional president Sun Yatsen used a Ford Model T and his successor Chiang Kaishek used an armoured Packard limousine in China and a Cadillac 75 armoured limo in Taiwan. In the early 90s, Chinese leaders switched to using minibuses, such as the Toyota Coaster, or Hongqi CA630 for short-distance trips. When visiting a foreign country, Chinese leaders generally use vehicles supplied by the host country. This custom began to change in November 2014, when Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party, used his own Hongqi L5 limousine on a state visit to New Zealand. Chinese premiers continue to use cars supplied by the host country.  Hong Kong  Lexus LS 600h L used as the official transport for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The HKSAR crest is used in place of a license plate. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. The official vehicle of the chief executive of Hong Kong bears no license plate but the Emblem of Hong Kong. This follows the practice of the British governor, as the representative of the British Crown, the laws of Hong Kong did not apply, including the need for a number plate on the car. Hence the official limousine simply had a Crown emblem front and rear in place of number plates. The current chief executive Carrie Lam is usually driven in a Lexus LS 600h L hybrid vehicle. Occasionally, the chief executive is also seen using a 1997 Mercedes-Benz S500L. Senior government officials, including the chief secretary, chief justice and commissioner of police, are each assigned a Volkswagen Phaeton.

Jacques Chirac preferred Citro√´n while Fran√ßois Mitterrand was a Renault fan, occasionally using his own Renault 5 model and the presidential Renault Safrane. For his inauguration parade in 2007, Sarkozy used the one-off Peugeot 607 Paladine model, a stretched limousine with landaulette body, originally built as a concept car in 2000. The model was brought out of storage for the occasion and updated with a new grille and lights to bring it in line with the 2004 re-style of the mainstream model. It has since been returned to Peugeot and, as it effectively remains a concept car in its fit and finish, will not become part of the √âlys√©e fleet. President Hollande used a one-off convertible version of the Citro√´n DS5 Hybrid4 for his inauguration parade on 15 May 2012.

The president was saved in two assassination attempts by French Algeria supporters by the car's unique ability to drive on three wheels and to keep running when more than one tyre is punctured. For ceremonial occasions, the president also has access to two special open top Citro√´n SM Pr√©sidentielle models, created for President Georges Pompidou by the coach- builder Henri Chapron. Based on the SM Opera, itself a special edition four- door coup√©, these cars are still used for state occasions and military parades, when the open-top layout enables the president to stand in the back seat and survey the crowd. Built for an official visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972, the cars have a standard mechanical layout with the addition of a special gear for low-speed cruising. One of these cars was also used by President Fran√ßois Mitterrand for the official opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994, when it accompanied the Rolls-Royce Phantom VI of Elizabeth II. Number plates on these cars are standard French ones, although specially created for the model (2 PR 75 and 3 PR 75, '75' denoting the Paris region).

The theater is a single-screen venue with a seating capacity of approximately 485, a classic McKim, Mead & White design from 1935. Regionally, it is known for its large screen, 70 mm film projection capability, Ultra High Definition 4K Digital Cinema and classic movie palace atmosphere. The Dolby/Altec sound system is legendary. Cinestudio features a spectacular gold austrian screen curtain that rises at every show, real balcony seating, and the gold lion courant insignia. Cinestudio Theater History Cinestudio was founded in 1970 by a group of students at Trinity College. The students converted a large lecture hall in the college's Clement Chemistry Building on the Long Walk quad into a recreation of a 1930s film house. The theater was created as a cooperative, with students overseeing all aspects of the theater's operation. Cinestudio made its mark early by showing controversial films and debuting future cult classics, including The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Harold and Maude and Pink Flamingos. Cinestudio has continued largely as a cooperative operation. Two founding members, James Hanley and Peter McMorris, have guided the theater since its inception and now manage its day-to-day operation. A staff of approximately 50 student and community volunteers run showings seven days a week. In 2002, Cinestudio incorporated as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization. The theater now is independent of Trinity College, although it still occupies space in the college's chemistry building. In 2007, the theater's ticket booth was renamed the Fred Pfeil Memorial Ticket Booth in honor of late Trinity College professor and long-time Cinestudio volunteer and board member, Fred Pfeil. Films Cinestudio screens a variety of second-run, independent, and classic films. Program booking is an open process in which patron participation in the film selection process is welcomed. Annually, Cinestudio hosts several film festivals, including The Connecticut Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, April in Paris, and Trinity Film Festival, the international student film festival.

Red-collared widowbirds are found in grasslands and bush clearings in Eastern and Southern Africa. They are known for their long tails and brilliant red badges, both which act as sexual ornaments. They are often associated with other widowbird and bishop species. They are polygynous, where males acquisition of territory is an important determinant in their access to mates. Red-collared widowbirds have a wide range and there is little concern in terms of conservation status. Taxonomy The red-collared widowbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Fringilla ardens in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The red-collared widowbird is now one of 17 species placed in the genus Euplectes that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1829. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek eu \\"fine\\" or \\"good\\" and the New Latin plectes \\"weaver\\". The specific ardens is Latin for \\"burning\\" or \\"glowing\\". Traditionally, Euplectes is thought to contain two clades, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular evidence suggests that the red- collared widowbird is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with southern red bishop, yellow-mantled widowbird, fan-tailed widowbird, and black-winged red bishop. Three subspecies are recognized: * E. a. ardens (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì Sierra Leone to Uganda, southwest Sudan, northwest and south Tanzania south to east South Africa * E. a. laticauda (Lichtenstein, MHK), 1823 ‚Äì southeast Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia * E. a. suahelicus (van Someren), 1921 ‚Äì central Kenya to north Tanzania The latter two taxa are treated as a separate species, the red-cowled widowbird (Euplectes laticauda) in the online edition of the Handbook of the Birds of the World. Description Pair of specimens in the Nairobi National Museum Similar to other widowbirds, male red-collared widowbirds have both seasonal and sexual dimorphism. Males are about in length while females are only 13 centimeters. A similar trend is seen with weight, where males range from and females are only between 16 and 22 grams. During non-breeding seasons, the male plumage is brown, while in breeding season, October to April, they have black plumage with a long tail, approximately 22 cm, and crescent-shaped carotenoid based chest patch. There is significant variation in brightness, hue, and chroma of the carotenoid badges. In contrast, females and subadults, like nonbreeding males, are streaky dull brown with a short tail, approximately 4 cm. Nonbreeding males, however, retain their black tails, while females and subadults' tails are dark-brown. Distribution and habitat Red-collared widowbirds are found throughout Eastern and Southern Africa. While their habitats are varied, they are often found in open grasslands, agricultural areas, clearings in forests, and on slopes with limited tree coverage. Behavior and ecology Diet Red- collared widowbirds feed on seeds of sorghum and other grass seeds. They also feed on nectar, small berries, and insects, specifically ants, caterpillars, and termites. They often form large roosts, with between 50 and 100 individuals, which feed together on the ground. These roosts included breeding males. They are often formed with association with other species, like red- billed quelea, fan-tailed widowbird, southern red bishop, white-winged widowbird, and yellow bishop. Breeding and mating systems Typical of polygynous species, male red-collared widowbirds do not provide parental care. In fact, the only resources males provide are potential nest sites in their territories. They are different from other Euplectes species in that the males use only a simple nest ring in courtship and the females build and position the actual nests. The nests are usually oval in shape and the females line the nests with grass. Females continue to add to the nest during the incubation. Old nests are often occupied by zebra waxbills. There are usually between 2 and 4 eggs in a clutch, each egg being greyish or blue-green, with brown speckles. The incubation period, done only by the female, is between 12 and 15 days. Females also do all of the feeding, primarily via regurgitation, during the nestling period for the offspring, which is between 14 and 17 days. The nests are commonly parasitized by Diederik cuckoos. Because they are offering no other gifts, it is very important for the males to establish an exclusive territory at the beginning of the breeding season to ensure successful mating. Males aggressively defend their territories from intruders. There is no difference in costs or benefits between females who choose unmated males, monogamy, and females who settle with mated males, polygyny. Females may gain indirect benefits of picking higher quality males by producing higher-quality offspring, without suffering costs of shared territories. Sexual ornaments Tails During prenuptial moulting, prior to the breeding season, the males replace their non-breeding feathers. Males that hold territory have shorter tails and carotenoid collars that are 40% larger than nonbreeding floating males . The red collar is for male-male competition, while female choice is based on tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with carotenoid signal. Also, looking at body size and condition, this accounts for 55% of the variation in tail length. Body size may play a role in the variation of size and redness of both territorial and floater males. Female preference for long tails was first observed in long-tailed widowbirds, and then subsequently observed in Jackson's widowbird and the red- collared widowbird. Tail length explains 47% of the male's reproductive success, indicating the strength of this sexual ornament. Tail symmetry, however, does not have an effect on mating success. In the red-collared widowbird there is a strong trade-off between carotenoid coloration, which is an agonistic signal and tail length, which is an epigamic signal, directly attracting females. These are both costly ornaments that are maintained through multiple receivers. Plumage Red-collared widowbird in Ngorongoro, Tanzania The red-collared widowbird has one of the highest measured plumage carotenoid concentrations in birds. There is a high presence of lutein and zeaxanthin in the feathers, which is consistent with their high dietary consumption of grass seeds. There is a carotenoid basis of ‚Äòredness‚Äô observed in the bird, and studies suggest that its color production is due to enzymatic conversion of dietary pigments into red keto-carotenoids, a costly process. The red collar functions as a dominance signal, which was supported experimentally through manipulation of the badges. The experiment showed that red-collared males dominated orange males, which in turn dominated brown and blue collared males. Furthermore, with additional manipulation of badges, males with enlarged red, enlarged orange, and reduced red collars obtained territories, while those with reduced orange and blackened or removed collars failed to establish or maintain territories. Lastly, males with reduced signals defended smaller territories, had more intruders, and spent more time, thus increased cost, on aggressive interactions. Collectively, these observations led to the conclusion that redness, and to a lesser degree size, indicate dominance status and fighting ability in male contests. Fluctuating asymmetry is a population phenomenon of random deviation in a morphological trait. Some researchers think that fluctuating asymmetry reflect an indirect measure of fitness. This is because sexual ornaments are under intense directional selection. The sexual ornament displayed, the degree of fluctuating asymmetry, reflects the male's ability to deal with environmental and genetic stress, thus as an observer, there is a compromise in males between tail length and symmetry. The tail length itself is the strongest predictor of mating success. However, when the tails were experimentally manipulated, comparing a shortened tail to the control, these males had equal success in acquiring territory with no difference in size or quality. The long-tailed controls spent less time flying and performing courtship displays and they attracted higher quality and more nesting females compared to short- tailed males. Demonstrating the high cost of the long tail, the control birds with longer tails showed a more significant decline in condition, measured by relative body mass, compared to the birds with shorter tailed birds. Additionally, longer tails are aerodynamically costly, hindering flying ability by increasing drag. Both the short tailed and control residents have declined condition compared to the floaters, the males who did not establish territories, which suggests an interaction between tail lengths and there is high cost of territory acquisition, defense, and courtship displays. Signals To explain the existence of multiple handicap signals, multiple receiver hypothesis has been proposed. In an environment, rivals and mates potentially assess different signals, thus making more than one ornament maintain stable condition-dependent signals, reflecting different qualities or associated costs. These signals are maintained because they target different receivers and reflect different aspects of fitness. This is extended to explain increasing complexity of signals, where different receivers are receptive to different aspects of the same signal. In the case of the red- collared widowbird, the elongated tail addresses female choice, while the red carotenoid badge addresses aggressive male competition over territory. Status The red-collared widowbirds are not considered to be globally threatened. They have a very wide range and are found commonly in many regions. They can be found in Kruger National Park, located in South Africa, with a large population of an estimated 2000 individuals. Additionally, the species is found in South and Central Mozambique with approximately 11,000 individuals.

Adult breeding males are almost entirely black with orange and white shoulders (epaulets), long, wide tails, and a bluish white bill. Females are rather inconspicuous, their feathers streaked tawny and black with pale patches on the chest, breast and back, narrow tail feathers, and horn-colored bills. When flying, male long-tailed widowbirds are readily visible due to their extremely long tails. Between six and eight of their twelve tail feathers are approximately half a metre (approximately 20 inches) long. The tail during flight display is expanded vertically into a deep, long keel below the male as he flies with slow wingbeats 0.5 to 2 metres (20 to 78 inches) above his territory. Because of the seemingly large cost to such male ornaments, the long-tailed widowbird has been the subject of extensive research into the function and evolution of sexually selected traits. This research has demonstrated the existence of female choice in sexual selection and indicates the trade-offs between sexual appeal and physical constraints with regard to the evolution of sexual ornaments. Taxonomy The long-tailed widowbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a bird collected in the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Emberiza progne in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The long-tailed widowbird is now one of 17 species placed in the genus Euplectes that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1829. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek eu \\"fine\\" or \\"good\\" and the New Latin plectes \\"weaver\\". The specific progne is Latin for a \\"swallow. Three subspecies are recognised: * E. p. delamerei (Shelley, 1903) ‚Äì central Kenya * E. p. delacouri Wolters, 1953 ‚Äì Angola, south DR Congo and Zambia * E. p. progne (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì southeast Botswana to east South Africa The long-tailed widowbird has three geographically differentiated subspecies. These include delamerei, found in the highlands of Kenya, delacouri, found in the Congo, Angola and Zambia, and progne, found in Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho.Craig, A. (1993). Geographical variation and taxonomy of the genus Euplectes (Aves Ploceidae). The long-tailed widow birds. Revue de Zoologie Africaine 107(2): pp. 139‚Äì151. Some researchers have suggested the existence of long-tailed widowbird superspecies based on similarity in male nuptial plumage such as tail length, but this is the topic of some debate.Andersson, S. and Andersson, M. (1994). Tail ornamentation, size dimorphism and wing length in the genus Euplectes (Ploceinae). The Auk 111: pp. 80‚Äì86. Description Long-tailed widowbirds exhibit distinct sexual dimorphism. Males and females exhibit differences in behavior and morphological traits. Adult males are entirely black, including under their wing-coverts. Males' wing shoulders are orange red and their wing-coverts white. Their bills are bluish white. Males are known for their distinctly long tails, which contain twelve tail feathers. Of these twelve tail feathers, between six and eight are approximately half a metre (approximately 20 inches) long. Males have wingspans of approximately 127 to 147 mm (approximately 5 to 5.8 inches). Females have a rather subdued coloration. The upper portion of the female's body is streaked with buff or tawny and black. Female chests, breasts and flanks are slightly paler than their above coloring. The area under the wing-coverts is black and the females' tail feathers are narrow and pointed. Finally, their bills are horn- coloured. Non-breeding males are slightly larger than females, though they demonstrate a remarkably similar appearance. For the most part, these males are colored in the same manner as the females, except in that they are more broadly streaked above and below and have wings and wing shoulders with the morphology of the breeding class of males. Rarely, males in the non-breeding class have elongated brownish black tail feathers, though these feathers are substantially shorter than those of the breeding class. Immature males and females are very similar in appearance to the adult female. However, immature males, much like adult non-breeding males, are slightly larger than adult females. Distribution and habitat There are three known isolated populations of long-tailed widowbirds. The first is found in the Kenyan highlands, the second in Angola, southern Zaire and Zambia, and the third in southern Africa. It is unknown when these populations were last in contact, however, and the central population differs most in morphology relative to the other two populations.Craig, A. (1980) \\"Behaviour and evolution in the genus Euplectes.\\" Journal of Ornithology, 121: 144‚Äì161. The southern African population extends from the Eastern Cape (Transkei region) through the Free State, Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal, and western Swaziland to the Transvaal plateau. The species just enters southeastern Botswana, but is most commonly found in the central highveld of South Africa. Long-tailed widowbirds are generally found in swampy grassland in flocks consisting of one or two males and a number of females. The males fly with their tails drooping and somewhat spread, and with slow regular movements of their wings. In wet weather, they are unable to fly due to their elongated tails. During the non-breeding season, long-tailed widowbirds congregate into flocks, which can be found roosting in reed beds. The long-tailed widowbird can be found at elevations up to 2,750 metres (9,022 feet) in the Drakensberg Mountains.Andersson, Malte. (1994). Sexual Selection. Princeton University Press; Princeton, NJ: pp. 112‚Äì117. Three male long-tailed widowbirds, showing breeding and non-breeding plumage Behaviour Food and feeding The long-tailed widowbird's diet generally consists of seeds, supplemented occasionally by arthropods. The birds do most of their foraging in flocks on the ground, though they are occasionally observed hawking insects airily.Hockey, P.A.R, Dean, W.R.J. and P.G. Ryan. (2005). Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa, VIIth ed. The Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund; Cape Town. The long-tailed widowbird feeds on a distinct variety of seeds, including those of Setaria sphacelata (twisted-leaf bristle grass), Paspalum dilatatum (common paspalum), Paspalum distichum (couch paspalum), Pennisetum clandestinum (Kikuyu grass), Triticum (wheat), Themeda triandra (rooigras), and Senecio juniperinus (groundsel). They also feed upon both insects, including species of beetles (Coleoptera), cicadas and aphids (Hemiptera), and spiders.Hockey P., Dean W. and Ryan P. (2005). Roberts ‚Äì Birds of southern Africa, VIIth ed. The Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund, Cape Town. Breeding Males defend territories in the grasslands the species inhabits. Females have a long nesting period and survey these territories and the males that inhabit them prior to mate selection. Breeding takes place from February to July, reaching its peak in March and April. Females weave nests, shaped in large dome structures with a lining of seedheads, in the high grass within males' territories. The nests are placed 0.5‚Äì1 meters (19 to 40 inches) off the ground in the upper third of the high grass (Eleusine jaegeri), where the females raise their two to three young. Females often mate with the male within whose territories they nest. Females lay one to three eggs after mating, and these are pale bluish green and streaked with brown. They are usually around 23.5 millimeters (0.9 inches) by 16.5 mm (0.6 inches) in size. Sexual selection Charles Darwin first expressed his ideas on sexual selection and mate choice in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 in response to questions surrounding the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species exhibit despite detrimental costs to survival and seemingly negative consequences for reproductive success.Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. John Murray; London. He proposed two explanations for such traits' existences: these traits are useful in male-male combat or are preferred by females. Relative to the first of Darwin's theories on sexual selection, the process of female choice, though theoretically plausible, took a considerable amount of time to gain acceptance because Darwin had little, if any, firm evidence that females did in fact choose mates based on characteristics they found attractive.Fisher, R.A. (1930). The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. Claredon, Oxford.Maynard-Smith, J. (1958) in A Century of Darwin (ed. Barnett, S.A.). Heineman; London: 231‚Äì245. It took ninety years after Darwin's initial proposal for the theory to be tested in what has become a classic example of behavioral ecology research.Davies N, Krebs J, and West S. (2012). An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology, 4th Ed. Wiley-Blackwell; Oxford: pp. 188‚Äì192. The male long-tailed widowbird has one of the most remarkable ornaments among passerine birds. Their tails, which are often more than half a meter (20 inches) long, are the most extreme sexual ornament among Euplectes and seem to in fact be detrimental to the survival of the male. Thus, the tail appears to oppose forces of natural selection in the basic sense by decreasing survival in individuals who carry the trait. It was for this reason that researchers have chosen to focus their research into female choice on the confusing example of the long-tailed widowbird.  Andersson experiment  Malte Andersson and colleagues tested Darwin's (and Fisher's) theory of female preference for ornamentation as the cause of extreme elongation of the male long-tailed widowbird's tail. They changed the length of males' tails and studied their relative mating success. Early in the breeding season, the territories of thirty-six males were mapped and the numbers of nests were counted. The experimenters used each male as his own control by subtracting the number of nests in each male's territory before treatment from the total of nests after treatment. This reduced the influence of initial variation among male territories on the outcome of the experiment. In a randomized block experiment, the color-ringed males were partitioned among nine groups of four males each. These groups were similar in territory quality and tail length. The tail of one randomly selected male within each group was cut to about 14 centimeters (5 inches) in length. Each removed feather was then glued to the corresponding feather of another male, elongating his tail by 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches). The two other males in the group served as controls. One had his tail cut and repaired using glue, while the other's tail was left unchanged. A clear pattern of success emerged, with males with the elongated tails being the most successful, followed by the control (normal tail length) males, followed by the males with shortened tails. The result indicated that the long tail is favored by sexual selection through female choice of mates. Female preference for long tails is also seen in the red- collared widowbird.Pryke, S., Andersson, S. and Lawes, M. (2001). \\"Sexual Selection of Multiple Handicaps in the Red-Collared Widowbird: Female Choice of Tail Length but not Carotenoid Display\\". Evolution 55 (7): 1452‚Äì1463 The Andersson experiment demonstrated that female long-tailed widowbirds prefer supernormal tails, as males with elongated tails were found to be the most reproductively successful. The tail females found most attractive were longer than those that occur in the natural setting. This outcome was shown to be the result of female choice rather than differences in male behavior resulting from shortened tails: males with shortened tails neither became less active in courtship display, nor did they give up their breeding territories. Thus, the tail is used to attract females rather than in direct contests among males, which is further supported by the fact that males do not expand their tails during flight displays during territorial contests. Males' tail and epaulet Shoulder epaulet of breeding male One explanation for why females favor long tails in males is that the expanded tail enlarges the lateral surface area of the male by 2‚Äì3 times, making him much more visible from far distances over open grassland. However, this is most likely not the whole explanation, especially considering that prior to mating, females spend a great deal of time comparing males and, thus, do not rely on sighting them from a distance. As of this time, the exact function of epaulet in male long- tailed widowbirds is unknown. However, its use does resemble that of the red- winged blackbird, being displayed during courtship and threat displays. Thus, the two most conspicuous ornaments of the male birds in the two species may be favored by different forms of sexual selection: the tail of the long-tailed widowbird by female choice and the brightly colored epaulets of the long- tailed widowbird and red-winged blackbird by male contest competition. Conservation status The long-tailed widowbird has a very large range, and so the species would not be classified as vulnerable under the range size criterion put forward by BirdLife International which include that the extent of occurrence being less than 20,000 km2 (7722 miles2) combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation.BirdLife International.

The population is stable according to the population trend criterion, which requires a greater than 30% decline over ten years or three generations, and would not be considered vulnerable for this reason. While the total population size has not yet been quantified, it is not believed that the long-tailed widowbird is approaching the threshold for being considered vulnerable under the population size criterion (less than 10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern.

Description Like all widowbirds the male and female plumages differ prominently during breeding season. In the breeding season males moult into a black breeding plumage, which includes long tail feathers and yellow shoulder patches (these patches retain a discrete appearance during the non-breeding period). Outside the breeding season the sexes are similar in appearance, both having speckled brown and black plumage. Behaviour During this period males defend territories in the early morning after sunrise and in the evening before sunset. References * BirdLife International 2004.

He gave lectures with the Royal Academy of Medicine in Paris, and practiced surgery at H√¥pital de la Charit√©. He is remembered for his work with surgeon Jean-Louis Petit (1674‚Äì1750). Among his students was Swiss anatomist Albrecht von Haller (1708‚Äì1777). Le Dran made contributions in his pioneer research of cancer, and his work involving military surgery. He was among the first physicians to realize that cancer was a local affliction, and not a systemic malady. He postulated that cancer progressed in stages, and that it began as a local organic disease. He advocated surgery for cancer before the tumor was allowed to metastasize through the lymphatic system and affect other parts of the body. In 1741, Le Dran was the first to described the phenomenon known as the Spigelian hernia. He was elected in January 1745 a Fellow of the Royal Society. He is widely credited for introducing the medical term \\"shock\\" (choquer), which he defined in a treatise on gunshot wounds as a sudden impact or jolt Pediatric critical care medicine By Derek S. Wheeler, Hector R. Wong, Thomas P.

It is found in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and dry savannah. Description The southern white- crowned shrike grows to a length of about . The sexes are alike; in the adult bird the crown and forehead are white, and the mask is black and extends above and below the eye to the side of the neck. The nape and upper parts are ashy- brown and the wings and tail are dark brown. The underparts are off-white, the upper breast being tinged with buff. The lower belly and vent areas are ashy- brown. The beak is black, the eyes brown and the legs dark brown. Juveniles are similar to adult birds but the crown is slightly mottled and barred and grey rather than white. The chin and throat are white but the remaining parts of the underparts are tinged with ashy brown. Ecology Like the closely related northern white-crowned shrike this species is highly sociable and will form small, tightly-knit groups of usually three to six individuals, but occasionally up to twenty outside the breeding season. They are not in general aggressive birds but will attack predators such as birds of prey. When foraging, they sometimes associate with Tockus hornbills, feeding on the insects they disturb as they walk around. Members of the group engage in cooperative breeding, joining together in building a brooding nest, take turns in sitting on the eggs and assist in the feeding of nestlings. Status The southern white-crowned shrike has a very wide range and is described as being very common in places, though rare in others. No particular threats have been recognised and the population seems stable. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

It is monotypic within the genus Falculea. It is endemic to Madagascar. Its natural habitats are tropical dry forests and tropical dry shrubland. Taxonomy The sickle-billed vanga was described by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1836, who also erected the genus Falculea to place it in. There are no subspecies. Like many members of the vanga family it was previously placed in another family by early scientists. In the case of this species it was placed with the crows and jays in Corvidae by H. Gadow in the 1883 Catalogue of the British Museum. Within the Vangidae it seems that the closest relatives are the Bernier's vanga (Oriolia bernieri), the white-headed vanga (Artamella virdis) and the three species in the genus Xenopirostris. It is thought that the sickle-billed vanga split from the white-headed vanga around 1.1 million years ago. The two species share similar plumage but are very different in size and bill shape, reflecting the wide plasticity in body shape and feeding ecology in the vanga radiation. Both species, as well as their other close relatives, also share a unique intense black colouration in the mouth. Description The sickle-billed vanga is the largest of the vangas, measuring in length and weighing . The most striking feature is the bill, which is strongly decurved and measures and is blue-grey fading to ivory at the tip. The plumage is striking, with a white head, breast and belly and the back, wings and tail being black with a blue sheen. The iris is brown and the orbital ring around the eye is black. The legs are strong and coloured dark grey to pale blue. There is no sexual dimorphism. Juveniles are similar to adults but the black feathers on the back and wings are tipped with buff. Distribution and habitat Andohahela National Park is one of many national parks that holds the sickle-billed vanga The sickle-billed vanga is endemic to Madagascar, where it is found throughout the western side of the island. It ranges from sea-level up to . It is found in dry deciduous forest as well as thorn-forest. It can also be found in open savanna and in wooded areas around villages. The species is non-migratory. The species is common within its range and is protected by a number of national parks, including Andohahela National Park, Ankarafantsika National Park, and Berenty Reserve. As such it is evaluated as Least Concern by the IUCN. Behaviour Diet and feeding The sickle-billed vanga is a social species, particularly in the tiding flea season when it can travel in groups of up to thirty birds while foraging for food and form roosting groups of over fifty birds. These flocks become smaller during the breeding season, but retain a small group of non-breeders that forage together over a wide area. They will form mixed-species foraging flocks with the related white-headed vanga and the crested drongo. The species feeds on a wide range of terrestrial invertebrates, including spiders, cockroaches, crickets, beetles, and worms. Small vertebrates, including chameleons and geckos, are also part of the diet and are also fed to nestlings. They generally feed in trees and particularly favour large branches, and will probe their long bill deep into holes and use it to lever off bark to get at concealed prey, occupying part of the niche usually filled by woodpeckers, which are absent from Madagascar (they do not fully fill the niche as they do not hammer the wood for prey). Breeding The sickle-billed vanga is apparently a seasonal breeder, with the season running from October to January in Ankarafantsika National Park in the north western part of the island. This coincides with the end of the dry season. The species is one of the vangas that has a polyandrous breeding system, where one female will mate with two or more males and all are responsible for raising the young. It is the female that engages in courtship displays, approaching the male and quivering her wings while holding the body in a horizontal posture. The male does not perform any display in return. Sickle-billed vangas are territorial and the males in the group will defend the territory from rivals and from potential or actual predators. The nest is atypical for the family, consisting of a large untidy bowl of twigs, in diameter, situated off the ground in the fork of a tree. The inner structure is lined with more delicate material. It is constructed by both sexes, but more work is done by the female. The clutch consists of three or four eggs, which are creamy white with mottling (particularly towards the larger end of the egg). Both sexes incubate the eggs, and feed and brood the chicks, but as with nest construction the female does more of the work than the males. The incubation period is 16 to 18 days, and chicks fledge after 19 to 23 days.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task in combat areas, she was awarded one battle star during World War II, two during the Korean War, and thirteen campaign stars and the Navy Unit Commendation during the Vietnam War. Tolovana was laid down on 5 June 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 730) at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 6 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Richard M. Bissell, Jr.; acquired by the Navy on 24 February 1945; and commissioned that same day, Lt. Comdr. Carleton G. Long, USNR, in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Following shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay and repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Tolovana put to sea on 25 March bound ultimately for the western Pacific. En route, she stopped at Houston, Texas, from 30 March to 2 April; loaded diesel oil; and continued on her way. The oiler transited the Panama Canal on 6 April and, after further repairs at Balboa, Panama, resumed her voyage west. On 23 April, she reached Pearl Harbor and reported for duty with the Service Force, Pacific Fleet. After completing voyage repairs and loading aviation gasoline, Tolovana stood out of Pearl Harbor on 28 April. On 9 May, she entered the lagoon at Ulithi Atoll in the Western Carolines and reported for duty with Service Squadron 10. Three days later, she returned to sea bound via Kossol Roads in the Palaus to Leyte Gulf. Tolovana discharged the aviation gasoline portion of her cargo at Kossol Roads on 14 and 15 May and transferred her diesel oil to gasoline oilers at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, between 17 and 31 May.  Dangerous operations  Since her tanks had not been contaminated with fuel oil and gasoline constituted the commodity in greatest need at Okinawa, Tolovana was earmarked for duty shuttling it between Ulithi and the combat area which was considered too dangerous for merchant tankers. She returned to Ulithi from Leyte on 2 June and loaded her first full cargo of gasoline. For the remainder of the war, the oiler steamed back and forth between Ulithi and the Ryukyus delivering aviation and automobile gasoline to the tank farm on Okinawa. She experienced frequent air attacks but suffered no combat damage.  End-of-war activity  When the war ended in mid-August, Tolovana was at Okinawa. During the immediate postwar period, she continued to make the Okinawa-Ulithi gasoline shuttle in support of occupation forces. Later that fall, she widened her sphere of operations to include such ports as Jinsen, Korea; and Yokosuka, Japan.  Supporting atomic testing at Bikini  In May 1946, she moved to the Marshall Islands to support Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll. She remained in that area until 17 June when she headed back to the United States. Tolovana reached Long Beach, California, on 6 July and entered the naval shipyard for her first overhaul since commissioning.  North Pacific operations  On 22 September, the ship emerged from the naval shipyard revitalized and began two years of duty along the western coast of North America. During the greater part of that period, Tolovana provided logistics support for bases in Alaska and in the Aleutians chain. She made frequent calls at Adak, Attu, Kodiak, and Anchorage, Alaska, while operating from Seattle, Washington, and periodically returned to California ports for visits and overhauls. She also made a voyage apiece to Guam and to Pearl Harbor during the period.  Transfer to East Coast operations  In August 1948, Tolovana bade farewell to the cold waters of Alaska and headed via the Panama Canal to Bremerhaven, Germany, where she stopped over for five days in mid-September. The oiler returned to the west coast late in October, reaching Long Beach, California, on the 19th, and resumed logistics support missions along the western seaboard and in the Aleutian Islands. During the ensuing years, she continued such duty. However, her sphere of operations widened to include ports in the western Pacific, in the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. Frequently, she called at such ports as Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia to take on petroleum products directly from the producers and then carry them to American bases in Japan and the Philippines.  On loan to the MSTS  In August 1949, the Naval Transport Service - with which she had been serving since December 1949 - was reconstituted as the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). When transferred to the new organization, ships like Tolovana ceased to be commissioned ships in the Navy, though they continued to perform their familiar logistics support function for the Navy as well as for the other services.  Korean War operations  The outbreak of war in Korea during the summer of 1950 increased Navy requirements for oilers engaged in direct support of the combat fleet. Thus, they were recalled from MSTS' general logistics operations and converted to perform such missions. Tolovana entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 15 February 1951; emerged ready for duty just over three months later; and, on 24 May, was recommissioned, Capt. E. C. Madsen in command. However, the oiler did not deploy immediately to the combat zone. Instead, she resumed operations off the west coast until early July when she made a voyage to Guam. On 24 July, Tolovana departed Guam and shaped a course for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 8 August. She spent the remainder of the month there, preparing to deploy to the Far East and the Korean combat zone. On 1 September, the oiler stood out of Pearl Harbor and headed west. Just under two weeks later, she arrived in Sasebo, Japan, and reported for duty with Task Force (TF) 77. Between 20 September and 18 December, Tolovana provided logistic support for the carriers of TF 77 and their supporting forces as well as for United Nations units operating ashore at Chosen, Songjin, and Wonsan. On 18 December, the ship returned briefly to Sasebo and departed the same day on a voyage to Okinawa, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, during which she provided support for American forces at Okinawa and for those engaged in the Taiwan Strait patrols. Tolovana returned to Sasebo on 31 January 1952 and resumed her support role refueling and replenishing units of TF 77 operating off the Korean coast.  Supplying the Trust Territories  On 18 March, the oiler returned to Japan at Yokosuka and, after two days of preparations, sailed for the west coast of the United States. She arrived in San Pedro, California, on 1 April and began two months of training operations. On 7 June, Tolovana put to sea bound for the Trust Territories in the central Pacific where, for the next six months, she delivered fuel and supplies from Pearl Harbor to the mid-Pacific islands: Midway Island, Eniwetok, and Kwajalein. She stopped at Hawaii on 12 December for the last time before returning to the west coast. The next day, the ship shaped a course for Long Beach, California, and entered the port on the 19th.  Vietnam operations  Over the next six years, Tolovana deployed annually to the western Pacific. In each case, she departed the west coast during the summer months and returned in December or January. Her duties normally consisted of logistics missions in support of TF 77 and of the Taiwan Strait patrol. However, during the first of these six tours, she was called upon to join in Operation Passage to Freedom - the evacuation of French and loyal Vietnamese from Haiphong in communist North Vietnam to South Vietnam following the collapse of French rule in Indochina. The remaining five deployments to the Far East involved routine logistic support for units assigned to TF 77 and to the Taiwan Strait patrol. When not cruising Asiatic waters, Tolovana punctuated training operations off the California coast with upkeep and periodic overhauls. In January 1960, Tolovana returned to the U.S. West Coast completing the last in her series of six, regular summer-fall deployments to the Far East. This, however, did not signal an end to such duty but rather to its regularity. In fact, over the next four years, she completed five tours of duty in Asian waters. During the second of this series, she was called upon to support those units of the fleet sent to Southeast Asia late in March 1961 to bolster the resolve of pro-western forces in Laos crumbling in the face of a major push on the part of Pathet Lao guerillas supported by North Vietnamese regulars. Though American resolve lessened the probability of a complete collapse of the anticommunist faction in Laos, the crisis did not die away until after Tolovana left the Far East in May to return home. She began her next tour of duty in the western Pacific in October 1961 and returned to the United States in February 1962.  Supporting Operation Dominic nuclear testing  The following summer, the oiler participated in \\"Operation Dominic\\", a nuclear test conducted at Christmas Island during June and early July 1962.  Continued Vietnam War operations  Tolovana refueling and off Vietnam, 12 September 1966. After another relatively routine assignment with the U.S. 7th Fleet between October 1962 and April 1963, Tolovana entered a decade in which her service mirrored the increasingly more direct involvement of United States forces in the Vietnam War. During that period, she made eight deployments to the western Pacific; and, on each, her crew members qualified for combat campaign ribbons. During the first of this series of tours, American presence remained small, and Tolovana spent comparatively little time in support of the operations there. However, by the time of her next cruise to the western Pacific - July to November 1965 - America's buildup had begun in earnest. From that point on, she concentrated upon replenishing ships in the combat zone, returning briefly to Subic Bay in the Philippines or to Yokosuka or Sasebo in Japan to refill her tanks. The fact that Tolovana never came under enemy fire did not diminish her effectiveness. She contributed to the success of underway replenishment operations - pioneered by the Navy during World War II - which, in turn, enabled American warships to remain in action for extended periods of time and bring the full weight of their naval might to bear on the struggle.  Routine operations, Far East liberty  On the other hand, there were breaks in the routine. She called at various liberty ports in the Far East such as Hong Kong; Bangkok, Thailand; Yokosuka and Sasebo in Japan; and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. During the 1967 and 1968 deployment, she was ordered north to provide logistics support for ships of Operation Formation Star which answered the call of , captured on the high seas in violation of international law by forces of the North Korean Navy. However, the major change in routine came between the deployments when she returned to the west coast for upkeep, training, repairs, and periodic overhauls. Her eighth and last wartime deployment came in September 1972, and she was still in the western Pacific in January 1973 when American involvement drew to a close. The oiler remained in the Far East until the following May and then departed Subic Bay to return to Long Beach where she arrived on the 24th. After three months in port at Long Beach, Tolovana resumed local operations in the southern California operating area until July 1974 when she stood out of San Diego, California, for the last western Pacific cruise of her career. That assignment continued until January 1975 at which time she returned to San Diego. Between 31 March and 1 April, the veteran oiler made the transit from San Diego to Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  Final decommissioning  On 15 April 1975, Tolovana was decommissioned, and her name was struck from the Navy List that same day. She was sold for scrapping, 16 October 1975, to Levin Metals Corp. under contract # (MA-8100) for $1.5M.  Awards  Tolovana earned one battle star during World War II, two battle stars for the Korean War, and 12 battle stars and the Navy Unit Commendation for service off Vietnam.

This mill complex at Uxbridge had been a hub of manufacturing for Bernat, once based in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The town of Uxbridge was the site of Bernat's main manufacturing unit in the later 20th century. This was the third largest yarn mill in the U.S. The Bernat mill and the town of Uxbridge have a role in U.S. history, and the history of the American Textile manufacturing. \\"Bernat\\" is a trademark of an existing company (Bernat.com) which manufactures yarn products. History The Capron mill, built by John Capron Sr. and his sons Effingham, and John, circa 1820, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The mill manufactured the first satinets, used the first power looms for woolens in America, and made US military uniforms for over 140 years. The original mill, the \\"Capron Mill\\", was built in 1820, by John Capron, the father of Colonel John Capron and anti-slavery champion Effingham Capron on the Mumford River at Uxbridge Center. The first power looms for woolens were introduced at the Capron Mills. These were made in a machine shop at Cumberland, Rhode Island. These were reportedly the first power looms ever made for woolens in the USA. The first manufacture of \\"satinet\\" was at this mill. Uxbridge became famous for its Cashmere wool. The period of the Capron Mill, and later as the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company was famous for manufacture of clothing and the manufacture of military uniforms for the United States. The Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company The mill was featured in the August 24, 1953 edition of Time Magazine, in an article entitled, \\"The Pride of Uxbridge\\" as the site of the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, which was then one of the most successful textile mills in New England. The Time Magazine article interviewed the CEO of Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, Harold Walter. This company had been started by Edward Bachman of New York City, and Harold Walters's father-in-law, Charles Arthur Root, of Uxbridge. This site was the hub of seven plants throughout the U.S., employing 6000 plus workers, and some of its wool synthetic blends dominated the women's fashion industry in the early 1950s. The first woolen mill in the Blackstone Valley was built in Uxbridge in 1810 (3rd in US), and by 1953, the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company was on the verge of a merger with the debt laden American Woolen Company to become the largest US woolen manufacturer. The Town of Uxbridge had become synonymous with woolen manufacturing, \\"blended fabrics\\", complete vertical integration of textiles to clothing, and textile industry efficiency innovations, when production peaked in the early 1950s. Research into textiles at Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company produced a range of blended fabrics, including the \\"wool-nylon serge\\" used for army uniforms. The original U.S. Air Force Uniform produced at the factory was dubbed and patented \\"Uxbridge Blue\\" or \\"Uxbridge 1683\\", after blue dye color selected at Bachman Uxbridge. This dye was used in the manufacture of uniforms from 1947. \\"In January 1948 President Truman approved authorization of the proposed new blue Air Force uniform and a week after that Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg officially circulated word that funding had been approved by the congressional appropriations committee. The new uniform, incorporating a shade of blue fabric (patented as 'Uxbridge Blue' and based on \\"Uxbridge 1683 Blue, cable shade 84\\", developed at the former Bachman-Uxbridge Worsted Company) would be available for distribution by September 1950\\".Of Uniform Concern: A Casual History of the USAF 'Blue Suit' By Kalikiano Kalei ‚ÄúShortly thereafter, on March 29, 1954, Time magazine reported; \\"American Woolen Co. will ask its stockholders to approve a merger with Bachmann Uxbridge Worsted Corp. As a combined operation, troubled American Woolen (1953 sales, $73,494,160; net loss, $9,476,981) and Bachmann Uxbridge (1953 sales, $52,609,000; profit, $272,000) would be by far the biggest woolen manufacturer in the country. Textron, Inc., which wants American Woolen to merge with it, and claims to own almost 4% of American Woolen's stock, plans to fight the merger,\\" see TIME CLOCK - TIME‚ÄùThree Portraits of the Root Family, by Ellery Hall The merger of American Woolen and Bachman Uxbridge was however blocked by Textron, which emerged in the 1960s as a Providence, RI based conglomerate. This was Bachman Uxbridge's last bid to be the largest woolen company in America. By 1964 the assets of Bachman Uxbridge were sold to Bernat Yarn of Jamaica Plain, MA American Civil War uniforms, World War I Khaki overcoats, and World War II U.S. Army uniforms have all been manufactured in this mill. Latch hook yarn kits were developed by Bernat, here circa 1968 and the name of the mill changes to the Bernat Mill, then the third largest U.S. yarn mill. 2007 fire Early, on the Saturday morning of July 21, 2007, a fire erupted at the historic mill, devastating the complex on Mendon and Depot Street. 600 firefighters from 66 communities battled the blaze, but the complex was nearly totally destroyed. It took three days to extinguish the flames fully. At the time of the fire, the structure, had ceased operating as a mill and had been converted into space containing 65 small businesses. The business losses following the fire were estimated in the millions of dollars and between 300-500 people lost their jobs. Fire cause and aftermath The fire marshall's report concluded that there was unpermitted welding occurring in a mill business, the sprinkler was not operable, and that both contributed to the fire. Mill owners planned to rebuild. The two-state incident command, disaster response was viewed as a regional model. Senator John Kerry introduced loans from his committee in the U.S. Senate to support the business owners impacted by the fire. Governor Deval Patrick left the National Governors' Conference in Michigan to return to Uxbridge to be present for the immediate recovery. Governor Patrick invoked immediate state and federal aide to victims and businesses of the Uxbridge mill fire. Hurricane Katrina funds were applied to the relief efforts. As of 2009, plans to rebuild were on hold.

WNRV is owned and operated by New River Interactive Media, LLC. History In 1953, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted an AM broadcast license to the Narrows, VA businessman \\"Happy\\" Romanus. He began building the WNRV station on a section of land located between the New River and the highway that is now known as Route 100 between Narrows and Pearisburg. Since the station was located next to a railroad track, the construction required special measures to prevent outside noises being heard on the air. In addition, in order to absorb vibrations from passing trains the control room was elevated several feet higher than the normal station floor level. In 1960 the station was sold to E.D. McWilliams. E.D.'s wife Megan took over ownership of the station after E.D's death. The arrival of Bob Whitehead was a critical event in WNRV's history. In 1959, Bob moved his family from Pennsylvania to the area and became known as \\"The Voice of the New River Valley\\" over the next thirty years. Bob and Megan both dedicated themselves during that period to make WNRV a community-based station and a strong force in Giles County. The station was active in many community events and was well known for leading multiple fund-raising causes, such as the Red Cross Bloodmobiles. Bob was one of Southwest Virginia's most respected broadcasters, and greeted his listeners each morning with his signature sign-on: Logo used by WNRV from 2007 to 2009. \\"Good morning everyone! This is WNRV, Narrows and Pearisburg in Virginia, beginning broadcasting activities for another day. WNRV operates on a federally authorized frequency of nine hundred ninety kilocycles, with a daytime power of five thousand watts.\\" The station's daytime license only permitted WNRV to broadcast from sunrise to sunset. However, there were numerous times the station was granted FCC permission to broadcast outside these time periods in order to provide the community with emergency information during severe weather events, such as floods and winter storms. This type of community service established WNRV as a critical source of local information during emergencies. An increase in transmit power from 1 kilowatt (KW) to 5 kilowatts was approved by the FCC in 1968. Megan McWilliams sold WNRV to a local partnership in 1990 and Bob Whitehead retired after the change in ownership. The new WNRV team consisted of General Manager Rebecca Lolli, Program Director Tom Crockett, and Sales/Marketing Manager Faye Nicholson. Giles County's first FM station WZFM 101.3 was launched by the new team in November 1991 with a \\"classic hits\\" format. In mid-1992 a large lightning strike destroyed WNRV's AM transmitter and took the station off the air for twelve weeks (this transmitter had been active since the late 1960s). The station installed a used replacement transmitter, but it experienced problems. WNRV went off the air about a month later for a second time due to additional issues. On September 28, 1992, an emotional goodbye message from Faye Nicholson marked WZFM going off the air. This, combined with the WNRV AM issues, left Giles County without any local radio stations. The next owner of WNRV was a Christiansburg, VA-based group, (Travis Media) which operated the station until 1999 under the brand name \\"100.7 FM/990 AM Kool Country... Kool 100!\\". Perception Media Group, Inc acquired WNRV in 1999. For the next eight years WNRV was used as a simulcast station for their Roanoke, VA WWWR (3WR) station with a Southern gospel and religious programming format. In mid-2007, operation of WNRV was assumed under a lease management agreement with Perception Media Group by Gary Jolicoeur and Dennis Welch. Gary and Dennis switched the format to bluegrass, which ushered in the current era of WNRV. This history of WNRV was taken from the WNRV website, and was based on an article written by James Riffe, Jr, a former WNRV Announcer (1983‚Äì1988) and former WZFM/WNRV Announcer and Account Executive (1992). James still periodically works with WNRV for a variety of production and promotion-related tasks. In July 2007, WNRV changed its format to Bluegrass and began broadcasting local programming back home out of its old studios between Narrows and Pearisburg. In July 2008, WNRV started full-time 24/7 Web- Streaming. In November 2009, WNRV launched a new website. Station sold An FCC application to transfer the WNRV license from Perception Media Group, Inc. to New River Interactive Media, LLC was submitted on October 6, 2009. The sale of WNRV to New River Interactive Media was completed in November 2009. This sale puts the station back under a local ownership group. The current format is bluegrass and old-time, with some classic country mixed in. 66th birthday WNRV celebrated its 66th birthday in 2019. The first WNRV broadcast license was approved by the FCC on August 24, 1953. The station still transmits out of the original building that was constructed in 1952. FM Translator The FCC approved an FM translator license for WNRV in October 2018 and WNRV began simulcasting full-time on FM 97.3 in November 2018. The FM call sign is W247DC.

It is a sequel to Telltale's previous video game based on the Sam & Max intellectual property, Sam & Max Save the World. Gameplay Season Two builds on Season One with more dynamic NPCs, an updated engine, a hint system, support for widescreen monitors, more realistic animations, and more mini-games within each episode. Season Two features a calibration assistant when first run, which allows the player to set their graphics and difficulty settings before playing. Release Unlike Save the World, where GameTap users were able to access each episode two weeks before it was available through Telltale's website, Beyond Time and Space reduced this period down to one day. The first episode, \\"Ice Station Santa\\", was released on November 8 on GameTap, followed by a worldwide release on November 9. However, the second episode was delayed until January 11, 2008. New episodes were thereafter released on the second Thursday and Friday of each month. As with Save the World in 2007, Beyond Time and Space was released on Steam on May 16, 2008. On December 2, 2008. a press event in London, Atari announced a new partnership with Telltale to bring Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space to retail worldwide in 2009. It will be for both Microsoft Windows and Wii. There will also be fully localized releases in French and German, as well as Italian and Spanish subtitles for the foreign language versions of Beyond Time and Space. On February 26, 2009, Telltale officially announced Sam & Max Season One and Two for Xbox Live Arcade. Telltale also officially named Season Two Beyond Time and Space.  Synopsis  Taking place approximately one year after the events of the previous game, Freelance Police Sam and Max return to their office after a \\"successful\\" peace summit, only to discover that their pet goldfish Mr. Spatula has turned evil and prepare to execute him. But before they can do so, Mr. Spatula is suddenly vaporized by a giant robot, who is intent on destroying the duo as well as razing the local city block near their offices. After dealing with the wind-up monstrosity, Sam and Max learn that the Maimtron 9000 was actually a gift from Santa Claus. The two head to the North Pole and find the remaining elves in Santa's workshop cowering, as Santa keeps shooting at them with a machine gun. Sneaking down a chimney into Santa's office, Sam and Max find evidence that an evil spirit is running amok at the North Pole, and work at collecting The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse action figures to use as part of a ritual to bring the demon (known as the Shambling Corporate Presence) forward so they can capture it and free Santa. However, to their surprise, the demon never had possessed Santa, but rather one of the elves instead, and runs off to distract the Shambling Corporate Presence while Sam and Max work to complete the final part of the ritual: calling forth the three Spirits of Christmas (Past, Present, and Future). Each of the Spirits offers to help, but only if Sam and Max correct a Christmas they had ruined in the respective time periods. After satisfying each of the tasks, the Spirits proceed to help Sam and Max and reduce the demon to a plate of Jell-o, which Santa inadvertently eats afterwards and becomes infused with the evil spirit for real. Sam and Max are able to knock Santa out, and after determining that a typo on a shipping label was responsible for delivering the spirit to Santa instead of Satan, send the possessed Santa on his way to Hell. With dawn approaching, Sam and Max volunteer to deliver all the Christmas presents in Santa's place, but drive away in their car before they can be loaded up, with Max stating that there's no rush because it's the middle of November. On returning home from the North Pole a month later, Sam and Max find their friend Sybil being chased by a big triangular portal. Asking Bosco about it, he claims that the portal is actually a Bermuda Triangle, taking things into parts unknown. Though Sam and Max are able to stop the triangle in its tracks, soon after Abe, having went out to investigate what happened, is sucked into the portal, leading Sybil to jump in after him, followed by Sam and Max in tow. After jumping through, the duo find themselves on Easter Island, where Sybil and Abe are enjoy a picnic, but are told by the local Moai Heads that a prophecy will destroy them all. It states that a volcano will erupt, covering the island in magma and destroying the Moai Heads, and according to them, the end is coming soon, and they need Sam and Max's help to stop it. Taking the case, Sam and Max find the entrance to a mysterious cave, guarded by a baby Jimmy Hoffa (having drunk too much from the Fountain of Youth and reverted to infancy), whom they need to get rid of somehow. Also around this time, Abe ends up breaking up with Sybil after his continuous ogling of the Wind Moai. Sam and Max eventually trick Baby Jimmy Hoffa into consuming more of the Fountain Water, erasing himself from existence. Having finally gained entrance to the cave, they discover a group of aquatic Ocean Chimps who worship the Moai Heads' giant stone feet. They also find out that the ghost of Mr. Spatula is behind it all, having established himself as High Priest of the group and planning to use a mechanism that controls the volcano to set off an eruption. After some puzzle solving, Sam convinces the Ocean Chimps that Max is the true High Priest, but once they succeeded, Mr. Spatula had already set off an eruption which they're too late to stop. However, the two manage to save the island by using a giant Bermuda Triangle, diverting the lava to some place else, but also unfortunately sucking up the Bermuda Triangle back to home, leaving them to have to swim back to New York with Abe in tow, while the Moai heads are left to live on for another thousand years. After the credits, the Moai Heads are seen being lifted out of the ground and into the sky by a bright light. Sometime later, Sam & Max are caught in an elaborate death-trap by a goth vampire named Jurgen, with Max wondering how they got to this point. A flashback starts off the first part of the episode: Having returned home after their adventures on Easter Island, Sam and Max are in the middle of dealing with a zombie attack when the Commissioner calls about a zombie attacks throughout the city. By talking to the C.O.P.S. they find out that the zombies are coming from The Zombie Factory, a nightclub in Stuttgart, Germany. The club turns out to be located in an old castle and run by the vampire Jurgen. Jurgen is far too powerful to confront directly, but by using various vampire weaknesses (holy water, uv light and garlic clove cigarettes) Sam and Max manage to destroy the source of his power: his popularity. They pursue him to his back room, where they have the most impressive fight of their career. Since Max remembers that part, the flashback ends and the story is back at the scene in the introduction, with them stuck in the trap after losing the fight. Unfortunately, they've now spent so much time reminiscing that it's too late to escape and the trap snaps shut, killing the Freelance Police. The pair wake up later in the graveyard transformed into zombies and find that they can now understand other zombies but their mortal friends cannot understand them. They return to the back room but find Jurgen sleeping in his coffin and their souls trapped waiting to be shipped off to hell. To make things worse, their souls don't even want to reunite with them. The Soul Mater Sybil got on the Internet is just what they need to get their reluctant souls back in their bodies, but she needs it herself to find a date after having broken up with Abe in Moai Better Blues. Sam and Max eventually manage to turn Jurgen's Monster into the perfect date for Sybil, inadvertently convincing her to get back together with Abe afterwards, and grab the Soul Mater. When they get back to their souls, though, a malfunction makes them end up the each other's bodies. Meanwhile, Jurgen has awakened for a final confrontation. In the end they beat Jurgen by using their combined souls in the Monster's body to impale a wooden stake through his chest, and in his dramatic exit he stumbles into his own trap and has his soul taken by the same mysterious light that abducted the Moai Heads. Just when Sam gets his own soul back (Max gets his back between episodes), their neighbor and fellow detective Flint Paper arrives with bad news: Bosco has gone missing! In a scene after the credits, a still zombified President Max gives a press conference. Looking into Bosco's mysterious disappearance, Sam and Max, joined by Flint Paper bust into his store to look for clues. After messing around in the back room a bit, Sam and Max set of a baking soda and vinegar explosion and are subsequently abducted by a UFO themselves. On board they quickly find Bosco, who has turned into a cow! As they soon find out from the ship's A.I., the UFO harbors a time traveling elevator which Bosco has stumbled into making him inadvertently alter his own past before he was born. Sam and Max use the time machine for some meddling of their own and eventually manage to restore Bosco to his old self, after which the three of them explore the UFO further. But when they get to the next room, they're surprised by the sudden appearance of T.H.E.M. (The Temporal Headquarters of Enlightened Mariachis), who sing a song explaining that they're three different instances of the same mariachi, Pedro, who travel through time in order to perform at everyone's birthday. They also collect souls (including those delivered by Jurgen) as a means to pay for their spaceship and transfer them to Hell through a Bermuda triangle in the soul crushing room, after using the Moai Heads to process them. By the time the song ends the shock is too much for Bosco to bear and he dies of a heart attack, making the mariachis decide to use his soul to fill their quota. Sam & Max use various tricks and much more meddling with time to get all three of T.H.E.M. off the ship and seize control so they can rescue Bosco's soul, unintentionally bringing back two past versions of themselves from Season One's 2nd episode Situation: Comedy in the process. After an accidental push of a button activates the Soul Crushing device and sends Bosco's soul to hell, they try to go after it but accidentally trigger the ship's self-destruct sequence. As their past selves make off with the elevator, they have no choice but to go through the portal Bosco's soul was sent through. In the final scene, the spaceship explodes just as it reaches the beginning of time, thereby causing the Big Bang and the creation of the universe. After going through the portal, Sam and Max find themselves in a subway station to Hell. When they go up they find that the subway station had been below their neighborhood all along. Bringing the Maimtron 9000 back to life, they use the giant robot to recover the soul token of the recently deceased Ms Bosco and use it to gain passage on a train to Hell, planning to get Bosco's soul back from the devil. When Sam and Max reach Hell, they discover it resembles an office environment and all their dead enemies from past episodes work there as employees. Since Satan simply ignores them, they decide to have a look around themselves. They quickly find out where Bosco's soul is being held, as well as the souls of everyone who's died during their cases. After all of these personal hells are sabotaged Satan has no choice but to talk, and Sam demands that all these souls be released. Satan agrees, but tricks Sam into taking their place himself. Max gets him out, though, and they go have another discussion with Satan. At that point it becomes clear that they have all been tricked, with this latest setback putting Satan in a sufficiently weakened position to be fired by \\"management\\", the Soda Poppers!, a trio of former child stars who have frequently crossed paths with the Freelance Police during their adventures. Revealing themselves to be the masterminds, the Soda Poppers downsize Satan and fire him. Determined to keep their evil plot going, each Popper sets out to fulfill three tasks of forcing humanity to recommit the Original Sin, seduce a woman to create a hellspawn, and to entrap a new soul of the 21st century. Thanks in part to some (mundane) items Satan has with him, Sam and Max eventually subvert all of these schemes, and team up with Satan to take Hell back from the Poppers. But the Soda Poppers assume their demon forms and banish Sam and Max into a lava pit below. However, in a set up in Ice Station Santa, their past selves give them Santa's sleigh allowing them to escape. The Soda Poppers are still going strong but are ultimately tricked into using their own banishing ritual against themselves, entrapping them in the same fiery pit and allowing Satan to take back control over Hell. Sam and Max bid farewell to Satan and leave Hell to attend the wedding of Abe and Sybil. The end credits show Sybil and Abe's wedding, officiated by Max and attended by nearly every character seen so far in the past two seasons. The married couple take off in the still possessed Desto, leaving Sam & Max concerned for their safety. In a scene after the end credits, the Soda Poppers swear revenge on Sam and Max, only to be brutally killed by a massive magma flow from Moai Better Blues, leaving only Peepers' eyes behind.  Recurring characters  In addition to the characters already introduced through Sam & Max Season One, Season Two introduces some additional recurring characters. *Flint Paper: Flint runs his own gumshoe detective business in the office next to Sam & Max; however, what exactly his business or cases are remains a mystery. As in the comics, his days consist of beating up bad guys and wooing attractive female clients. In season two, he is on a case to track down the man who trashed Mama Bosco's store in the 60s. In Sam and Max Hit the Road, Flint and the door to his office were featured in the second location of the game, where he threw someone out of a window and shot a smiley face into the wall with a tommy gun. Curiously, when asked where he'd been, his adventures sound near-identical to Sam & Max's. *Mister Spatula: Max's pet goldfish who lives in the office water cooler. In Season One he was made Vice President of the United States under Max's administration, but he soon developed a lust for power that turned him \\"pure evil\\" according to Sam. He becomes the High Priest of Easter Island before Max takes over in \\"Moai Better Blues\\". *The Maimtron 9000: A giant robot (first briefly seen through a window at the beginning of Season One's Episode 5) that demolishes half of the neighborhood in episode 1, \\"Ice Station Santa\\", thought to have been sent by Mister Spatula to assassinate Max. He says his only function is to kill and destroy, but in conversation he will frequently respond to questions by singing pop songs of the 80's and 90's. After being deactivated by Sam, his collapsed body is converted into a casino for rats by Jimmy Two-Teeth. The Maimtron 9000 is reactivated in the season finale by Sam and Max using the portable A.I. acquired in the previous title. *Santa: Is the main character of episode 1, \\"Ice Station Santa\\". He is seen hiding in his room standing on top of a safe containing the spirits of Christmas. After the battle with the Shambling Corporate Presence, Santa accidentally eats the jello that SCP turned into, causing him to be possessed. After Sam & Max fight Santa again, Santa is sent to hell. In episode 5, he is imprisoned in his personal hell. He must constantly recall toys for various safety issues, while constantly being harassed by demon babies, saying that he hates kids, and took the one job in the world where he'd only ever have to be around children once a year. *Jurgen: A German Goth styled vampire, he is the main villain of episode 3, \\"Night of the Raving Dead\\", and had a brief appearance in episode 4. He reappears in Episode 5 as a receptionist in Hell and is still angry at both Sam & Max for landing him in his predicament. *Pedro: A Mariachi singer who suddenly appears and sings a birthday song whenever a character mentions a personal birthday. He has made brief appearances in episodes 1 through 3, and was given a larger role in episode 4, \\"Chariots of the Dogs\\" as well as having a small role in the season finale. Pedro was first named in episode 4. *Shambling Corporate Presence: A gelatinous demon from Hell and the main villain of episode 1, \\"Ice Station Santa\\". Re-appears as an employee of Hell, LLC in episode 5. Was a minor character in \\"Reality 1.5\\", the game-within-a- game in the Season 1 episode, \\"Reality 2.0\\". *Stinky: A young lady who owns \\"Stinky's Diner\\" across the street from Bosco's store. She claims to have inherited the diner, and her name, from old Stinky, her supposed grandfather. The claims (and old Stinky's fate) are questionable, as Stinky is also a constant liar, claiming that she is a very famous actress, inventor of artifacts, and studied beliefs, like \\"voodoo queen\\". This causes Sam and Max to have increasing suspicions that Stinky has murdered grandpa Stinky to take over the diner. Sam and Max meet the original \\"Grandpa\\" Stinky in episode 4, \\"Chariots of the Dogs\\", after traveling through time to the early 1980s version of Stinky's Diner. The older Stinky has a strong dislike for the U.S. government, and has a tendency to exaggerate his exploits, much like the younger Stinky from 2008, though the old Stinky claims to never having had any children. In episode 5, Old Stinky revealed that he had really died in a mountain climbing accident, and girl Stinky is actually his protege. In actuality, girl Stinky is a golem, \\"The Cake of the Damned,\\" an unholy concoction created by old Stinky from an entree (Fish sticks), a side dish (Tar Cake), and a dessert (Coffee Ice Cream), and brought to life in human form by adding a spare rib into the mix. *Timmy Two-Teeth: Jimmy Two-Teeth's son was introduced in episode 1, along with Jimmy's ex-wife and Timmy's mother, Mary Two-Teeth. Timmy is a young rat diagnosed with terminal Tourette syndrome; as a consequence, a large part of his speech is censored (although in a sense of irony, he doesn't really swear, but says stuff like 'Heck yeah' or 'Have a flippin' day'). Despite this, he maintains a positive outlook on life. He dies in episode 5 and his soul goes to hell due to both Sam & Max's intervention (unlike his father, Timmy has lived a sin-free life, but his personal record was switched with Jimmy's at the moment of his death), but later his soul is released and Timmy comes back to life. He is also a great fan of the Soda Poppers (recurring characters from Season 1) and knows everything about them.

Weber was named after the German born surveyor Charles H. Weber (*1830) who died during a surveying project near Woodville in 1886. His body was only found three years after his disappearance. Weber is just off the former State Highway 52. This is a scenic tourist route between Waipukurau and Eketahuna which also runs past the place with the world's longest place name, Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu. A short distance from Weber are the Waihi Falls. Weber had a cemetery, located approximately 2 km to the west of the settlement. It contains around 51 burial plots with just under half of those being aged 13 or under. A recent, (2013), memorial to those buried there has been erected alongside the main road into Weber. Weber is the exact antipode for the Spanish capital Madrid. History The hamlet was founded the late 19th century as an overnight stop for coach teams on the journey to and from the coast. This was the distance a team of 6 horses and a coach could travel in one day. At the turn of the century it was a thriving small community. It had a police station and one cell jail, a large hotel, shops and a post office. Today it consists of a church, a school, a pub, a rural fire depot, a community centre and several houses. Wises index of every place in NZ (1897) describes Weber as, WEBER, Hawke's Bay. On Akitio River; in Waipawa County; 104 m south from Napier. Rail to Dannevirke, thence coach Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 25 m (10s). Daily service in summer. Grazing and sawmilling. Good shooting, game of all kinds in season. Cycle roads fair only; the Akitio River falls reached on horseback, great attraction. One hotel; private board 25s. Post and telegraph office, called after the first surveyor of the township. Resident doctor. Is the name of a county. A recent (2013) memorial to the Weber cemetery was erected alongside a paper road some 2 km west of the settlement. In 1990, Weber was the epicentre for a large earthquake. The local geology of the area magnified the effect making the earthquake seem worse than it was. It is known locally as the \\"Mother's Day earthquake\\" as it occurred during Mother's Day. During the two world wars the local population of Weber lost a great number of its men. Weber has a permanent war memorial. The first ANZAC parade in 50 years took place in 2010.

In the past the species was considered to be related to the Australasian robins but this was as the result of convergent evolution. It is endemic to Timor island. The black-banded flycatcher is small with a broad bill and distinctive plumage. The species has a white belly, lower rump and throat with a thin black band across the chest. The tail, neck and wings are black and the back, upper wing and shoulders rich chestnut. The plumage of the head is sexually dichromatic, with the head being black in the males and dark grey in the females. The eye and bill is black and the feet and legs are yellow. The calls consist of soft whistles, some of which sound similar to the Timor stubtail. The black-banded flycatcher is an uncommon species that is difficult to see and very little is known about its biology. The natural habitat of the species is lowland monsoon forests and hill forests up to 1200 m. Nothing is known about its breeding behaviour, the only observations of this are adults feeding recently fledged chicks in December. It feeds singly or in pairs on invertebrates, taking its prey mostly by gleaning with a few sallying flights to snatch aerial prey. The species is currently listed as near threatened.

PAXTON\\", The Miami Herald, April 21, 1989. Accessed May 3, 2011. \\"He was a native of Kearny, N.J., and learned his trade at the Julliard School of Music, where he mastered many musical instruments.\\" In 1933, while still in high school, Paxton formed a six-man band with schoolmates Tony Mottola and Herbie Haymer. The three later moved to New York City, where Paxton was hired to write arrangements for band leader and Meadowbrook Inn owner Frank Dailey. In the late 1930s, Paxton got a job with George Hall's Orchestra as an arranger and tenor sax player. Paxton was able to convince Hall to hire his high school friend and skilled guitar player Tony Mottola for the group. In Hall's group, Paxton got to work with other talented young musicians like Johnny Guarnieri on piano and Nick Fatool on drums. At this time, Paxton was also writing arrangements for Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol. In the early 1940s, Paxton arranged music for Bunny Berigan, Bea Wain, Charlie Spivak (along with Sonny Burke and Nelson Riddle), Ina Ray Hutton, Vaughn Monroe, and Sammy Kaye. George Paxton and His Orchestra After years of playing, arranging, and directing different groups around New York City, Paxton formed his own orchestra in 1944. The group became popular in New York City, and a ten-week engagement at the Roseland Ballroom turned into a one year run. Some of these performances were broadcast live on the radio, which helped gain the band some popularity. George Paxton and His Orchestra toured the East Coast of the United States and gained some acclaim by 1945. Vocalists included Alan Dale, Liza Morrow, Dick Merrick, and Gene Williams. Standout musicians were trumpeter Guy Key (sometimes \\"Kee\\") and saxophonist Boomie Richman (sometimes \\"Richmond\\"), as well as Andrew Ackers (piano), Romeo Penque (sax), Max Herman (trumpet), Vern Whitney (trombone), Doc Goldberg (bass), Nick Fatool (drums), and others. The orchestra's primary label was Majestic, however their songs were also released on the Guild, Hit, and MGM labels. Some of Paxton's compositions and arrangements include: \\"Paxonia\\", \\"All of Me\\", \\"Streamliner\\", \\"This Can't Be Love\\", \\"I'm Coming Virginia\\", \\"Jug Night\\", and \\"I'm Gonna See My Baby\\", among others. George Paxton, Inc. In 1949, Paxton was offered the job directing the house orchestra at The Capitol Theater in New York City. While there, he started a music publishing company; George Paxton, Inc. One of his first publications was \\"There's No Tomorrow\\", which became a big hit for Tony Martin. Coed Records George Paxton and Marvin Cane formed Coed Records, Inc. in New York City in 1958, and had offices at 1619 Broadway in the Brill Building. Paxton produced many of the songs on this label, most of which were of the East Coast Doo-wop group style, and some of these became hit songs of the day. Between 1958 and 1965, Coed's biggest acts included the Crests, the Rivieras, the Duprees, the Harptones, and Adam Wade, among others. Paxton's big-band background came in particularly handy with the Duprees, who combined group vocals with deliberately nostalgic swing orchestra backing on hits like \\"You Belong to Me\\" and \\"Why Don't You Believe Me.\\"[ allmusic ((( The Best of Coed Records > Overview )))] Other highlights include the Crests' \\"Sixteen Candles\\" and three songs from the group's so-called \\"angel series,\\" \\"The Angels Listened In,\\" \\"Pretty Little Angel,\\" and \\"Trouble in Paradise\\".

The term is used to refer both to dirges in the Hebrew Bible, and also to later poems which are traditionally recited by Jews on Tisha B'Av. In the Bible In the Hebrew Bible, the term kinah or qinah refers to a dirge or lament, especially as sung by Jewish professional mourning women. The Jerusalem Bible refers to Isaiah 47 as a qinah or \\"lament for Babylon\\",Jerusalem Bible (1966), sub-title to Isaiah 47 and to Ezekiel 19 as a qinah or lamentation over the rulers of Israel.Jerusalem Bible (1966), sub-title to Ezekiel 19 and footnote a A. W. Streane suggests that , on the prophesied downfall of Jerusalem, is written \\"in ·∏≤inah metre\\".Streane, A. W. (1911), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges om Jeremiah 22, accessed 10 February 2019 Tisha BeAv recitation On Tisha B'Av, Jews traditionally recite a series of elegaic poems, known as kinnot, after the evening and morning prayers. These poems mourn the destruction of both the First and Second Temple in Jerusalem and other tragedies in Jewish history, including the Crusades, the Expulsion of Jews from Spain and the Holocaust. The kinnot are recited on the night of Tisha B'Av after reciting the Book of Lamentations, which was also called \\"Kinnot\\" in the Talmudic eraSee, e.g., Bava Batra 14b before it assumed its more familiar name of \\"Eichah.\\" Development of the Ashkenazic kinnot The oldest kinnot were composed by Rabbi Elazar Hakalir,See who likely lived in the 6th-7th centuries. His kinnot resemble the structure and content of the Book of Lamentations. For example, one of his kinnot begins each stanza with the word \\"Eichah\\", the opening word of Lamentations. He often writes stanzas in an alphabetical acrostic, similar to the first four chapters of Lamentations. The style deals primarily with the destruction of the Second Temple, similar to Lamentations which mourns the destruction of the First Temple. The main impetus for creation of new kinnot during the Middle Ages was the Crusades, in which Christian mobs decimated many Jewish communities. The kinnot deal with the then-current tragedy of the Crusades, no longer focusing on the destruction of the Temple in the past. The loss of the Torah and its scholars, instead of the loss of the Temple, occupies a central theme. Rabbi Judah Halevi completely changed the nature of the kinnot with his compositions. There is no pain or despair over the tragedies of the distant or near past, but rather a longing for returning to Jerusalem in his poem, Tziyon Halo Tishali. The kinnot are arranged in modern printings approximately by the chronological order of their composition. Thus the reader experiences a developing feeling of deep sorrow building through the generations, combined with a yearning for the restoration of the Temple in the Messianic era. This is similar to the book of Lamentations, which waxes sorrowful with tales of woe, but ends on a note of optimism (\\"renew our days as of old\\", ). Sephardic kinnot The various Sephardic communities of North Africa and the Middle East have a rich tradition of kinnot.

Despite this, few kinnot have been composed in the last several centuries, and none of them had entered the standard kinnot service. After the Holocaust, many people felt that it was inappropriate to mourn on Tisha B'av for the destruction of cities during the Middle Ages without mourning the even greater tragedy of the Holocaust. For this reason, many people recommended the composition and recitation of new kinnot to commemorate the Holocaust. These people, including many important rabbis, argued that in every generation, kinnot were composed to address the difficulties of that generation. Some added that it was essential to incorporate such kinnot into the Jewish liturgy, lest the Holocaust be forgotten by future generations. One popular Kinnah on the Holocaust is Eli Eli Nafshi Bekhi, composed by Yehuda Leib Bialer. However, many other rabbis dissented on the grounds that they could not create new kinnot because the existing kinnot were holy and were composed by the greatest individuals of their respective generations, but today there is nobody who can write like them. Others claimed that any individual community could recite new Kinnot as they wished, but only the greatest rabbis would have the authority to institute new Kinnot into the communal service in the entire Jewish world community. Rabbi Yaakov Ariel claims that the kinnot service, unlike the Siddur and other Jewish rituals, was not created by authority of the rabbis, but rather developed based on the acceptance of communities and the decisions of the printers who produced printed copies. Thus the new kinnot could gradually enter the accepted roster of kinnot. However, since many congregations now recite kinnot to commemorate the Holocaust, this may become an integral part of the service without a formal decision.

Description  The Formicarius colma is generally a small bird, averaging around 18 cm with males weighing between 38 and 49 grams and females between 41 and 49 grams. Males are marked by a black forehead, rufous-colored (red-brown) crown and nape, with the crown including a variable amount of black feathers. Its back, rump, and wings are olive-brown color with a dusky brown tail and black on the neck, throat, and sides of the head. The upper breast is a dark black that merges into a dark gray on the lower breast while the belly and flanks are a paler gray with (occasionally) a brown wash. Underwing coverts are marked by a mix of black and cinnamon with the inner webs of remiges being dusky with a broad cinnamon bar across the base. Facial features include a brown iris and black bill while the tarsus vary from light gray-brown to a purplish-gray. The female is largely the same as the male, being marked with a white throat rather than the black seen in males. The four subspecies differ slightly from each other; the nigrifrons largely resemble colma but with more black on the head, the amazonicus resemble the nigrifrons but smaller with a deeper rufous head, short tail, and browner upperparts, and the ruficeps having an extensively rufous head. Juvenile rufous-capped antthrushes are marked by a white throat (like the female) and black spotting. The song of the rufous-capped antthrush is generally a 4 to 6 second long, fast, even-paced trill of about 14 notes per second. This song is between 2.2 and 3kHz, with this frequency being speculated as optimal for communication in thick, humid underbrush. The call of the rufous-capped antthrush is described as a single, clear ‚Äúpsee-eh‚Äù or ‚Äúpier,‚Äù while the song is described as a ‚Äúre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee-ee- ee-ee-ee‚Äù.William Belton.

Revista Brasileira de Zoologia, 28.vi.1985; pgs. 443-448. http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbzool/v2n7/v2n7a05.pdf  Distribution and Habitat  The F. colma is found in east Colombia (south of Vaup√©s), south and east Venezuela, the Guianas, and in Brazil north of the Amazon while the subspecies F. nigrifrons are found east of Ecuador, east of Peru, north of Bolivia (south to La Paz), and south of the Amazon. F. amazonicus is found in Brazil south of the Amazon, from east Madeira to north Maranh√£o, and south of Ji-Paran√£ and Mato Grosso. F. ruficeps is found on the coastal east and southeast of Brazil from Pernambuco to Rio Grande do Sul. The rufous-capped antthrush are widespread, predominately preferring the cooler, shady floor of terra firme forests, although they can occasionally be spotted inhabiting traditional forests and savanna forests. While they generally occupy the lowlands to 500m and locally to 1100m, interspecies aggression between the rufous-capped antthrush and F. analis has been observed to induce altitudinal displacement, with F. colma fleeing to higher and drier ravines and ridges while the F. analis occupy the lower lands. Additionally, in Manu, the black-faced antthrush, being both larger and more population-dense, dominate over the rufous-capped antthrush. While the two species frequently overlap due to F. colma's large distribution, the song of the F. colma has been reported to induce an aggressive response from the black-faced antthrush while the song of the black-faced antthrush causes recession of the rufous-capped antthrush, indicating further interspecies aggression. Other than interspecies aggression, the driving factor controlling the rufous-capped antthrush‚Äôs distribution is poorly understood, as they are believed to be a sedentary species.Philip C. Stouffer. Oct., 1997. Interspecific Aggression in Formicarius Antthrushes? The View from Central Amazonian Brazil. The Auk, vol. 114, No. 4 (Oct., 1997), pgs. 980-785. Oxford University Press.  Behavior and Ecology   Breeding  Very few rufous-capped antthrush nests have been found. Those found are composed of a crude arrangement of roots and leaves placed into a cavity. The clutch size of Formicarius typically consists two white, ovoid eggs that become stained and blotched soon after laying. Two eggs from one clutch were measured to be 28.6-32.3 x 21.8-24 mm. Rufous-capped antthrush hatchlings emerge altricial with long, spreading gray down. Juveniles are typically hatched around October (Brazil), however, in Colombia they emerge in May. In Brazil, males with enlarged testes are also seen in October while they are observed in April near Venezuela. Juveniles in Peru were flushed out of the nest in November.William Belton. June 27, 1985. Birds of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil Part 2. Formicariidae through Corvidae. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol. 180, article 1. pg. 11.  Food and Feeding  The diet of a rufous-capped antthrush consists of ants (Attinae) and grasshoppers (Locustidae and Tettigoniidae). They hunt by walking slowly and tactfully on the forest floor, picking prey off of leaf litter before flicking it away with their beaks. They usually hunt alone but have been observed hunting near each other in small groups. They are frequently seen alone or in small groups on the periphery of ant swarms. Additionally, Formicarius have also been known to occasionally eat snakes.  Threats and Survival  Currently, the largest threat to the rufous-capped antthrush is loss of habitat through mining and deforestation. While F. colma is currently not globally threatened, these activities have been shown to drive F. colma and other Formicariidae from their habitats. Because F. colma are sedentary, this makes it difficult for them to escape.  Relationship to Humans  Rufous-capped antthrushes are rarely seen, but rather heard through their loud songs and calls. The meat of Formicariidae is reportedly flavorous, however, their low population densities, secretive nature, and small size make them an unlikely candidate for hunting by native tribes, who prefer the black- capped antthrush more commonly seen around human settlements.  Status  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, rufous-capped antthrushes are considered of least concern and are not globally threatened. They are generally rated as uncommon to fairly common based on location and inhabit many protected zones. F. colma are fairly common in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia,Venezuela, and in the Guianas and rare in the Rio Grande do Sul.BirdLife International 2016. Formicarius colma.

The serra antwren is about long and weighs about . In the northern part of the range, the male bird resembles the black-bellied antwren, but the crown and upper parts are a richer, more chestnut colour and the edgings to the tertial feathers are rufous rather than white.

Distribution and habitat This antwren is endemic to inland parts of southeastern Brazil, where its range includes the states of Minas Gerais, and adjacent parts of Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo. Its range was extended northwards in 2011 during an ornithological survey, by it being recorded at two sites some further north than its previous known range; the birds were found when they responded to recordings of vocalisations of the species. The precise distribution of many bird species in this area is poorly known and whether these birds were a separate population or whether they were part of a continuous distribution wherever suitable habitat existed is unclear. Typical habitat for this species is scrub and cleared land where natural vegetation is regenerating, at altitudes of up to about . Ecology These antwrens usually forage in pairs, hopping purposefully and gleaning carefully among the foliage in thick shrubby vegetation. Like other antwrens, the diet consists mainly of arthropods; typically these include grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches, stick insects and butterfly and moth larvae.Zimmer, K. and Isler, M.

It is closely related to the Pale-legged hornero, and their global distribution overlaps somewhat. This species is monotypic, meaning there is only one subspecies. The lesser hornero is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, along the banks of the Amazon River and some of its major tributaries. It is a river specialist, feeding and breeding mostly in river island scrub and early successional scrub along the edge of white- water rivers and on young river islands and, in Peru the understory of Cecropia forest. This type of successional habitat is dependent on seasonal flooding and is patchily distributed along the length of its range. It is found from above sea-level.Remsen, J.V., Jr & Bonan, A. (2017).

(retrieved from http://www.hbw.com/node/56393 on 3 March 2017). The lesser hornero is a very small ovenbird, in length and weighing . The head is grey with a prominent white stripe above the eye, a white throat, a rufous rump and wings, tawny-buff breast and flanks becoming paler below. The bill is long and straight. Both sexes are alike, and the plumage of juvenile birds has not been described. The lesser hornero feeds on arthropods and other invertebrates. It hunts individually or in pairs, searching the ground, river-shore mud or low branches for prey, often foraging in dense cover. Like other species in its genus, it constructs a mud \\"oven\\" nest in the branches of trees, and lines the nest with grasses and hair. The clutch size is four eggs. Little else is known about its nesting habits, other than it has been recorded building its nests in November and incubating in January.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats south of Goa in India. These laughingthrushes move in groups in dense forests, producing loud calls but tend to be hard to spot in the undergrowth. They have brown upperparts, a white throat, a broad black mask through the eye and a heavy bill with pale yellow on the lower mandible. Despite the name, derived from the Wayanad region, this species has a wider range than the four other south Indian species of laughingthrush that are restricted to the higher elevation hills. Taxonomy The Wayanad laughingthrush was described by the British physician and naturalist Thomas Jerdon in 1839 and given the binomial name Crateropus delesserti. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the French naturalist Adolphe Delessert who had collected specimens from near Kotagiri in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Another description by the French ornithologist Fr√©d√©ric de Lafresnaye was published in 1840. The generic placement of this species has varied over time and it has been placed in the past under Dryonastes and Garrulax. A 2012 phylogenetic study suggests that it should be separated from Garrulax under the genus Ianthocincla. Following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved from Garrulax to the resurrected genus Pterorhinus. Description This species has dark brownish-grey upperparts, a black mask and a white throat. The breast is grey while the belly and underside are rufous. It has some resemblance to the rufous-vented laughingthrush (Pterorhinus gularis) of northeastern India which has a yellow throat. Some older treatments considered lumped delesserti with gularis. The ranges of delesserti and gularis are widely disjunct but museum specimens can be told apart by the pale lower mandible of delesserti unlike the all dark bill of gularis. The tail is uniformly coloured and is darker than the back in delesserti while that of gularis is pale with rufous outer tail feathers. The chin is yellow in gularis while white in delesserti. Distribution The Wayanad laughingthrush is patchily distributed south of Goa. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist forests. Their breeding has been recorded from the plains to the higher hills of southern India. The species has been recorded near Goa, Castle Rock, Karwar, Dandeli, near Bhatkal although it is rare in the northern part of its range. It has been recorded in the Brahmagiris, Nilgiris, and extending south to the Ashambu hills. Behaviour and ecology The species is extremely gregarious and tends to skulk in the undergrowth. Flocks vary from six to fifteen but sometimes as many as forty birds may be present together. They feed mainly on the ground turning over leaves to find insects and fallen seed or berries. The calls are load and include shrill chattering and cackling. Other calls include churring and chirping notes and some calls resemble those of the rufous babbler (Argya subrufa). The peak breeding season is mainly during the monsoons, April to August in Kerala and July to September in Karnataka although they may breed at other times of the year. The nest is an untidy cup of grasses with a dome above it. It is placed low in a bush, often on Strobilanthes sp. Three eggs are the typical clutch. The eggs are very spherical and white rather than blue, a feature shared with a few other laughingthrushes such as the white-crested laughingthrush (Garrulax leucolophus). More than a pair have been seen near a nest suggesting the presence of helpers at the nest.

Found in the high montane forests, this grey bibbed, rufous bellied bird with a prominent dark eyestripe and broad white brow was grouped along with the grey-breasted subspecies of the black-chinned laughingthrush and known as the grey-breasted laughingthrush. This species is found in the Palni Hills while another closely related form, the Ashambu laughingthrush (Montecincla meridionalis) with a shorter white brow is found in the high hills south of the Achankovil Gap and was treated as a subspecies. The two forms were together treated under the name of Kerala laughingthrush. Description Montecincla meridionalis from the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve) This species has a dark grey-brown crown and narrow dark grey eyestripe with a broad white supercilium above it. This supercilium extends behind the eye in this species but stops above the eye in the closely related meridionalis. The throat is distinctly grey unlike in the black-chinned laughingthrush found north of the Palghat Gap and continues into the upper breast. The grey of the upper breast is faintly streaked in brown. The lower breast and belly is rusty brown and the upper parts are olive brown. The bill is browner and not as dark grey as in the black-chinned. The Ashambu laughingthrush (M. meridionalis) which was earlier treated as a subspecies has greyer upper plumage, paler crown and the centre of the belly is white with chestnut brown on the flanks and vent. The iris is dark red or red-brown. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Taxonomy This species was described from the Kodaikanal region on the basis of a specimen obtained by Rev. Samuel Bacon Fairbank and came to be called the Pulney laughing-thrush. The lack of the black chin of jerdoni was noted even when this species was first described but it was made into a subspecies under jerdoni in the second edition of The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma in 1922 by Stuart Baker. In 1880 Blanford described meridionale based on a specimen obtained by F. W. Bourdillon. The close relationship of meridionale and fairbanki was noticed by William Ruxton Davison in 1883. The current regrouping of the forms, considering the Palghat Gap as a biogeographic barrier and giving importance to the chin colour, was introduced in 2005 by Pamela C. Rasmussen and Anderton. A study published in 2017 found that the species was best placed in a new genus Montecincla and that based on the divergence, meridionale is best treated as a full species.  Behaviour and ecology  Feeding on a berry They are found in pairs and small groups and they sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks. They feed on the nectar of flowers of Lobelia excelsa, Rhododendron and Strobilanthes species. They also feed on the petals of some flowers such as Strobilanthes and the fruits of a range of plants including Viburnum, Eurya, Rubus and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa. The breeding season is December to June but peaking in April and May. The nest is a cup of grass with moss and lined with fine fibre placed in a low fork hidden in dense vegetation. The usual clutch is two blue eggs with reddish markings and indistinguishable from those of the black-chinned laughingthrush. When the nest is predated or after the young fledge, the nest is destroyed. The nests of other birds in the vicinity may also be torn up by the parent birds. Unhatched eggs may also be eaten by the parent birds. The contact calls are very loud series of steeply ascending notes pee-koko... pee-koko followed by more abrupt notes. Numerous other vocalizations such as a low kweer calls are produced in other behavioural contexts. Some calls appear to be antiphonal duets. Distribution This species is restricted south of the Palghat Gap with the main distribution range in the higher regions (above ) of the Palani Hills extending into the Annamalai Hills in western Tamil Nadu and Munnar in Kerala. The nominate subspecies is found north of the Achankovil gap while meridionale is found in the hills to the south of it. In the Palni Hills, their densities varied across locations ranging from 1.4 birds per hectare at Kukkal, 0.5/ha at Poombarai, 0.33/ha at Kodaikanal Botanical gardens, 0.16/ha on the golf course and 0.22/ha at Paricombai.

It is endemic to montane forests of the island of Taiwan. Description White- whiskered laughingthrush is a large ( long) laughingthrush with a distinctive face pattern. The bill is thrush-like and yellowish to horn-colored. The eyes are black. The legs are strong and brownish pink. The mean body weight is about . It is a sociable species that often occurs in large groups. It is not necessarily afraid of humans. Habitat and ecology The species occurs at elevations between above sea level, but typically above 2000 m, in tall grass, forest undergrowth, thickets, and forest edge scrub. It can enter open areas by roadsides and in forest clearings. In the Yushan National Park, it was more abundant in mixed coniferous forest than in grassland, pine woodland, or spruce forest; along with Taiwan fulvetta (Fulvetta formosana) and Taiwan yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps), it was a dominant species in that habitat.

It is the oldest surviving lighthouse in North America and its construction is a National Historic Event. History Sambro Light, earliest known image, (inset of A plan of Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, 1760 by R. A. Davenport) The Sambro lighthouse was built during the Seven Years' War by the very first act passed by Nova Scotia's House of Assembly on October 2, 1758, which placed a tax on incoming vessels and alcohol imports to pay for the lighthouse.\\"Sambro Light Fog Horn Won't Be Turned Off Without Being Heard\\", Chebucto News Vol. 9, No. 10, January 2008 An earlier attempt by the colonial officials in 1752 to finance the lighthouse with a lottery was unsuccessful.Halifax Gazette, 1752 With funding secured by the Assembly, construction began in the fall of 1758. Masonry work was completed by November 3, 1758 and a temporary light was first lit while construction continued. Construction was completed in 1759 and Joseph Rous (brother of Captain John Rous) was appointed as the first keeper. The lighthouse was automated in 1988. Cannons were used to provide fog warnings beginning in the late 18th century until the 1870s when a steam fog whistle was installed. The island's location at the mouth of busy Halifax Harbour, surrounded by many rocks and shoals made it the setting of many shipwrecks over the years. One of the worst was the sinking of the liner SS Daniel Steinmann in 1884. Only nine people of the 130 aboard survived to be rescued by keepers of the lighthouse.\\"Daniel Steinmann-1884\\" On the Rocks Shipwreck Database, Maritime Museum of the Atlantic The lighthouse grew 22 feet higher in the fall of 1906, when the octagonal tower was extended by two extra stories. A new first order Fresnel lens from Barbier, Benard & Turenne in Paris was installed to complete the work in November 1906. Acetylene was first tested and then manufactured for the light in a specially constructed \\"gas house\\" in the cove below the lighthouse. Red stripes were added to the tower in 1908 to make the tower more visible against the snow. Sambro served as the departure point from North America for Joshua Slocum's famous solo navigation around the world in 1895. After an extended visit to his boyhood home at Brier Island and old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed on his around the world voyage from Sambro Island Lighthouse on July 3, 1895. \\"I watched light after light sink astern as I sailed into the unbounded sea, till Sambro, the last of them all, was below the horizon. The Spray was then alone...\\"Sailing Alone Around the World, Joshua Slocum, 1900  Sea battles  Naval battle off Halifax, 1782, (Sambro Light in background) As the landfall light for the major strategic port of Halifax, Sambro has witnessed many shipwrecks and sea battles. A few months before the Battle of Halifax, in December 1779, The schooner Hope wrecked near the Sambro Island Light on the Three Sisters Rocks. Captain Henry Baldwin and six other crew were killed. Weeks later, 170 British sailors were lost when two vessels ‚Äì the North and St. Helena ‚Äì were wrecked in a storm when entering Halifax harbour.p. 78 During the American Revolution, in the Battle off Halifax (1780), the British privateer brig Resolution (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the American Privateer ship Viper (16 guns) off of Halifax at Sambro Light. Described as ‚Äúone of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering‚Äù, the two privateers began a ‚Äúsevere engagement‚ÄùSimeon Perkins Diary. 13 July Thur. 1780 during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes.Bandits and Privateers: Canada in the Age of Gunpowder; Resolution was eventually captured by the American Viper but at a cost of 33 American lives versus 18 aboard the Resolution.There are varying reports on the casualties. Another source indicates that the Americans reported between 3 died (British reporting 30 American died), while British reported 8 killed and 10 wounded. Another battle during the American Revolution fought near the island was the 28‚Äì29 May 1782 Naval battle off Halifax, an engagement between the American privateer Jack and the British transport Observer. In a battle that lasted all night and into the next day, the 12-gun Observer captured the 14 gun Jack. passing Sambro Nova Scotia (1813) On September 1, 1782, the American privateer Wasp sailed to Pennant Point, where they were confronted by three men from Sambro who fired on them, killing one of his crew and wounding three others, including Captain Thomas Thompson. Captain Perry took command of the vessel and the privateers took one of the Sambro men prisoner. The privateers buried their crew member on an island in Pennant bay. They then began their return to Massachusetts by rowing to West Dover, Nova Scotia, and then on to Cross Island (\\"Croo Island\\") just off Lunenburg (\\"Malegash\\").John Fairbanks - His Journal. Collections of the Maine Historical SocietyAmerican Privateer Wasp During the War of 1812, the American privateer Young Teazer captured two vessels in May 1813 right off Sambro Island Light before the privateer was pursued and trapped by British warships near Chester, Nova Scotia, where Young Teazer was blown up with heavy loss of life to prevent capture. In World War I and World War II, German submarines torpedoed a number of Allied ships near Sambro. For example, in WW2, while mine sweeping near Sambro Light Vessel on 24 December 1944 while preparing to escort a convoy, HMCS Clayoquot was hit by a torpedo aft fired by U-806.German, Tony (1990).

Irwin, 2003, p.73-74 Major repairs to the lighthouse followed in 1998 when the lighthouse was reshingled and repainted. In 2003, Hurricane Juan caused major damage to the Gas House. Despite the fact that it is a recognized federal building and donors have offered to assist in repairs, the Canadian Coast Guard has refused to repair the historic building.Heritage Canada Foundation, Presentation to the Standing Committee of fisheries and Oceans, Many have accused the Canadian Coast Guard of essentially abandoning Canada's oldest lightstation to the elements, despite its historic status and proximity to Halifax. In addition to the unrepaired heritage gas house, the two keeper's dwellings have been left as gutted ruins. In October 2007, after the underwater cable supplying power to the island was damaged, the Canadian Coast Guard turned off the fog horn, ending over 200 years of fog warnings from the island with plans for a solar system with just enough power for the lighthouse beacon. The move triggered a protest move to protect the navigational role and heritage value of the light station.\\"Sambro Foghorn Goes Quiet\\", Brian Mendel, Chronicle Herald Tues.

The tower was also repainted. On August 16, 2008, the community of Sambro Harbour and the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society celebrated the lighthouse's 250th birthday by bringing 150 people to the island for talks and tours. One of the derelict keeper's houses was destroyed by a suspicious fire on September 14, 2008, raising fears about the fate of the other neglected heritage structures on the island such as the Gas House.\\"Historic Lighthouse Escapes Fire\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, September 15, 2008, page 1. Location Sambro Island from the northwest (Crystal Crescent Beach) The lighthouse is located at the summit of the half kilometre square Sambro Island. It is located on the western approaches to Halifax Harbour, about southeast of Sambro Harbour. It is surrounded by a maze of dangerous shoals. The lighthouse and island are owned and maintained by the Canadian Coast Guard. In addition to the 18th century stone tower, the light station includes the endangered 19th century wooden building known as the Gas House as well as a fog horn shed which is in poor condition. Ruins on the island include the basement of one abandoned keeper's house, the burned out ruins of another and a partially dismantled keeper's dwelling, all from the 1960s. Several cannons used as fog signals can be found near the tower. A narrow sheltered cove runs into the centre of the island. The island is granite, covered by a thin layer of topsoil. A unique geological formation, an intrusion dike, called \\"The Devil's Staircase\\" can be seen near the lighthouse. The massive First Order Fresnel Lens used at the lighthouse until 1968 can be seen at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. Good views of the site are obtained from Crystal Crescent Beach and Sandy Cove near Ketch Harbour. The Canadian Coast Guard has discouraged regular tours of the island, but starting in 2008, the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society and the community of Sambro presented day-long open house tours of the island once a year and a charter company run by a semi-retired local fisherman in Sambro Head began in 2008 to offer visits to the island by appointment.Skipper Dave Charters Commemoration The Sambro lighthouse was declared a National Historic Event in 1937, marked by a plaque and cairn mounted beside the United Church in nearby Sambro Harbour. The First order Fresnel lens which operated at Sambro from 1906 until 1968 is displayed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, along with the DCB electrical beacon which lit the tower from 1968 until 2007. The tower was declared as a Classified federal heritage building and the Gas House was declared a Recognized heritage building in 1996.Lighthouses and Lights of Nova Scotia, E.H.

It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal, where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. Little study was done on this species due to its abundance and lack of interest in its conservation.  Taxonomy  The rufous-necked laughingthrush was placed in the genus Dryonastes before being moved to Garrulax. Following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved again to the resurrected genus Pterorhinus.  Description  The rufous-necked laughingthrush is actually not a thrush but a species of babbler, it is roughly in length and weighs anywhere between . The rufous- necked laughingthrush as its name implies has a rustic color around its neck. overall the bird is grey with a black face and its rufous neck. Due to the fact that they are non migratory birds this means that they molt very slowly which means that they look the same as young birds than as older birds. The rufous-necked laughingthrush looks very similar to a rufous-cheeked laughinthrush yet the regions where both species are found are completely different.  Habitat and Distribution  The rufous-necked laughingthrush is found in the subtropical or tropical moist forests from Nepal to China extending down into Myanmar. It is a non migratory songbird which means it spends its entire life in the same location or habitat for both reproductive and non reproductive periods. Some populations are found in isolated regions of Nepal likely something that happened during the formation of the mountain ranges in the region. The species is commonly found in all of its native ranges and is considered of least concern by the IUCN redlist.  Behavior   Vocalization  The vocalization of this laughingthrush is a series of small chirps that ramble in out of order note calls which resemble mocking bird calls that simulate some babbling or laughing as the name describes. Its quick whip calls are easily recognizable especially in larger flocks of feeding groups.  Diet  Rufous-necked laughingthrush generally feed on insects but have generalist bills and can feed on seeds molluscs and berries as well. Due to this generalist feeding behavior food sources are not as difficult to come by for these laughingthrushes as they are for specialists.  Reproduction  Rufous-necked laughing thrush have not been studied for their reproduction but it is assumed that they reproduce similarly to other laughing thrushes. Their intelligence makes it difficult for parasitic reproducers like cuckoos to take advantage of them. Their egg recognition is very good and therefore can remove intrusive eggs that don't resemble theirs at all. In terms of mating rufous-necked laughingthrushes tend to are sexually dimorphic in size and it may be linked to the female choice of individuals with the best territorial defense and therefore size was probably selected over time. They breed from March to August, creating small cup nests that are compact and made of leaves and grasses.

The footballers are part of a sports club formed on 1 April 2006 out of the union of 1. FC Bamberg and TSV Eintracht Bamberg. With over 1,500 members it is one of the largest sports associations in the Upper Franconia region of the state and has departments for bowling, karate, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, and volleyball. History The two founding clubs initially held discussions around the possibility of a merger in the summer of 2005, but the talks failed when the proposal did not receive the necessary three-quarters majority support of the membership of TSV Eintracht. In January 2006, after another half-year of discussion and lobbying, Eintracht's membership overwhelmingly agreed to the merger, while the membership of FC Bamberg followed suit in March. The newly merged side took up the place of FC in the Bayernliga (IV) and earned an unexpectedly good 5th place result. In the following season, the club stayed on course for a top- four finish, which would have meant Regionalliga S√ºd qualification, for most of the season but failed in the end, finishing fifth again. However, the insolvency of the Sportfreunde Siegen and the fact that the SpVgg Bayreuth was refused a licence meant, Bamberg did still move up to the Regionalliga.Sportfreunde planen f√ºr die 5.

The rufous-chinned laughingthrush (Ianthocincla rufogularis) is a bird species in the family Leiothrichidae. It ranges across the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Southeast Asia. Taxonomy The rufous-chinned laughingthrush was described by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in 1835 from a specimen obtained in the Himalayas. He coined the binomial name Ianthocincla rufogularis. The type locality was restricted to the state of Sikkim in northeast India by Stuart Baker in 1920. This laughingthrus was normally placed in the genus Garrulax but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, the genus Ianthocincla was resurrected and rufous-chinned laughingthrush was returned to its original genus. Six subspecies are recognised: * I. r. occidentalis Hartert, 1909 ‚Äì west Himalayas * I. r. rufogularis Gould, 1835 ‚Äì central Nepal to north Assam (northeast India) * I. r. assamensis Hartert, 1909 ‚Äì southeast Assam (northeast India), east Bangladesh and west Myanmar * I. r. rufitincta Koelz, 1952 ‚Äì southwest Assam (northeast India) * I. r. rufiberbis Koelz, 1954 ‚Äì southeast Arunachal Pradesh (northeast India), north Myanmar and south China * I. r. intensior (Delacour & Jabouille, 1930) ‚Äì northwest Vietnam Description This mid- sized laughingthrush is found along the Himalayas and can be identified by the combination of the black cap and band on the brown tail. The underparts are greyish while the upperparts have scale like feather patterning. A distinctive pale loreal patch of buff colour and a broad dark moustachial stripe which borders the rufous chin and ear coverts are identifying features. There is however considerable geographic variation in plumage. The western population (occidentalis of western and central Himalayas) being greyer and paler making the dark patterns stand out in greater contrast. The eastern populations assamensis have a paler throat and the markings on the throat are much less marked. The populations in Meghalaya (rufitincta) has an orange wash on the underside from the throat to the belly. It is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Tibet and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

Current usages  In modern usage, the term \\"carriage house\\" has taken on several additional, somewhat overlapping meanings: * Buildings that were originally true carriage houses that have been converted to other uses such as secondary suites, apartments, guest houses, automobile garages, offices, workshops, retail shops, bars, restaurants, or storage buildings. * Purpose-built secondary homes, also called \\"detached dwelling units\\" or \\"accessory dwelling units\\", on the same lot as a primary residence. They have completely separate living areas and facilities, sometimes in the style of converted carriage houses. * A marketing term for single-family homes, built on a lot just large enough for the home, and often sharing in common land with other homes in the same planned unit development. They are more properly called \\"carriage homes\\" or \\"patio homes\\". Some municipalities have relaxed setback restrictions for such buildings or allow \\"zero lot line\\" carriage homes, in which a wall of the home lies on the property line itself. *Some municipalities, such as Ottawa in Ontario, Canada, have introduced regulations permitting coach houses to intensify use of urban residential space and increase affordability and possibilities for multi-generational housing in low-density areas.  Designs  Carriage houses for small, city houses could be small, utilitarian, and only adequate to house one small carriage. However, carriage houses for large estates could be quite elaborate and large enough to house many carriages, horses, tack, and hay. They could even include basic living quarters for the staff who managed the horses and carriages. Horses were occasionally stabled in the carriage house but usually in a separate barn or stable.  Other modern uses  Because of the prestigious nature of some large, elaborate carriage houses, the term \\"Carriage House\\" is commonly used as part of the name of businesses such as antique shops and restaurants.

She served her country primarily in the Pacific Theater of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task in combat areas, she was awarded three battle stars during World War II and thirteen campaign stars during the Vietnam War. Chipola was launched 21 October 1944 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland; Maritime Commission hull 729, sponsored by Mrs. P. C. Chubb; and commissioned 30 November 1944, Commander E. G. Genthner, USNR, in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Chipola arrived at Eniwetok from the U.S. East Coast and the Netherlands West Indies 31 January 1945. She fueled ships in the harbor, and sailed 9 February to operate at sea, serving the ships of the fast carrier task forces raiding Tokyo in preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima, and then the assault ships which carried out the landings on 19 February. Four days later, Chipola arrived at Ulithi, out of which she sailed between 23 March and 26 August, supporting the carrier task forces in the raids which preceded the Okinawa assault, and in their continuing operations during the conquest of the island. From July, she provided the oil which enabled the carriers and their screening ships to carry out a constant series of air attacks and bombardments on the Japanese home islands.  End-of-war activity  The oiler sailed from Ulithi 8 September 1945 to serve as station tanker at Tokyo Bay and other Far Eastern ports. Between 20 February and 18 March 1946, she sailed to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf to load oil, returning to station tanker duty at Sasebo. After spending the summer on the U.S. West Coast for repairs, she returned to duty in the western Pacific from September 1946 to May 1947, making three voyages to Bahrain during that time. Returning to the west coast for repairs, Chipola put to sea again 13 June 1947, and sailed west to Bahrain and the Suez Canal, making passage to Norfolk where she arrived 21 August. Almost constantly at sea on the important never-ending duty of keeping the fleet supplied with petroleum products, she voyaged from Norfolk to Bahrain, then sailed to make two voyages between Aruba and the Panama Canal Zone. She sailed from Crist√≥bal, for Bahrain, continuing through the Far East to San Diego, California, where she was overhauled.  Mediterranean duty  In the second half of 1948, Chipola served ships operating in the Far East once more, making two voyages from Japan to the Persian Gulf oil ports. She returned to west coast operations until 2 September 1949, when she sailed for the Panama Canal and brief duty in the Mediterranean. Chipola sailed from Naples, Italy, for Norfolk, Virginia, and between November and July 1950, made three voyages transporting oil from the east to the west coast. The oiler operated on the east coast and in the Caribbean until October 1950, when she sailed by way of Bahrain for Sasebo. She proceeded from Sasebo to Bahrain in December, and on the last day of the year sailed for San Francisco, California, and west coast duty until May 1951. Then she returned to the east coast, and carried oil from the Caribbean to Norfolk, as well as twice serving in the Mediterranean, until 3 May 1955 when she was placed in commission in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was decommissioned 1 August 1955.  Service with the MSTS  Chipola was recommissioned 29 December 1956 for service with the Military Sea Transportation Service until once more placed out of commission in reserve 7 November 1957. She was recommissioned 17 December 1960 and served with the Pacific Fleet. Chipola received three battle stars for World War II service and thirteen for campaign stars during the Vietnam War.

It is endemic to the Galapagos Islands. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. One of Darwin's finches, the species was the first which scientists have observed evolving in real-time. The population of medium ground finches has been experiencing inbreeding depression due to small population numbers. Inbreeding depression occurs when there is a decrease in fitness due to individuals mating with genetic relatives. Typically, this leads to a loss of genetic diversity and a reduction in heterozygosity.Markert, J, & Grant, P (2004). Neutral Locus Heterozygosity, Inbreeding, and Survival in Darwin‚Äôs Ground Finches (Geospiza fortis and G. scandens). Heredity, 306, 15. Description Like the other members of its genus, the medium ground finch is strongly sexually dimorphic; the female's plumage is brown and streaky, while male's is solid black, with white tips to the undertail coverts. The bird measures in length‚Äîwhich falls between the lengths of the small and large ground finches. The bill of this species is quite variable in size, though the length of the upper mandible is always greater than the depth of the bill at its base. The wing shape, on average, seems to change with ecological shifts. Different selective pressures act on the wing shape of the finches, such as natural and sexual selection. The males have shorter, rounder wings, which help with maneuvering around a female during sexual displays.Vanhooydonck, B, & Herrel, A (2009). Wing Shape Variation in the Medium Ground Finch (Geospiza fortis): An Ecomorphological Approach. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 129, 38.  Evolution  In 1977, a severe drought reduced the supply of seeds in the Galap√°gos. The finch, which normally preferred small and soft seeds, was forced to turn to harder, larger seeds. This strong selective pressure favoring larger beaks, coupled with the high heritability of traits relating to beak size in finches, caused the medium ground finch population to experience evolution by natural selection, leading to an increase in average beak size in the subsequent generation. Evidence of evolution through character displacement has been found in a population of medium ground finches on the Gal√°pagos island of Daphne Major. During a drought in 2004, overlap in the diets of the medium ground finch population and a recently settled population of large ground finches (Geospiza magnirostris) led to competition for a limited supply of seeds on which the medium ground finch population normally fed. Because the large ground finches were able to out-compete the medium ground finches for these seeds due to both a larger beak and body size, the medium ground finch population experienced a strong selective pressure against large beaks to avoid competition, ultimately leading to dramatic evolutionary change favoring smaller beaks in the subsequent generation. Habitat and range Endemic to the Gal√°pagos, the medium ground finch is found on ten islands: Baltra, Floreana, Isabela, Fernandina, Seymour, Pinz√≥n, San Crist√≥bal, Santa Cruz, Santa F√©, and Santiago. Behavior Feeding The medium ground finch feeds primarily on seeds, although it is also known to eat flowers, buds, and young leaves, and the occasional insect. It forages either on the ground or in low vegetation. Parasites The medium ground finch has been under parasitism of Philornis downsi, as well as the avian pox virus (Poxvirus avium). Although outbreaks of the virus have been historically rare, in 2008 there was an outbreak that showed to be present in 50% of the finches tested. As a result, the finches have developed antibodies to fight specific invasive parasites.Huber, S, & Owen, J (2010). Ecoimmunity in Darwin's Finches: Invasive Parasites Trigger Acquired Immunity in the Medium Ground Finch (Geospiza fortis). Public Library of Science, 5, 1-6. The finches with the highest amount of antibodies tend to have the highest fitness, and therefore produce more viable offspring. Philornis downsi Using a new mathematical model, a 2015 study, by Dr Jennifer Koop of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, suggests the population of 270,000 birds on Santa Cruz may become extinct in 50 years. The flies lay eggs in the nest including in the nestlings nostrils. The larvae feed on living tissue and in worst cases can perforate the bill. Possible solutions include the introduction of parasitic wasps which would lay eggs on the larva, or cotton wool treated with a pesticide which the adult birds would use when constructing the nest.

Considered an excellent high school baseball player, Duncan was chosen by the New York Yankees in the first round of the 2003 MLB draft, and became one of the best prospects in baseball. However, injuries and ineffectiveness in minor league baseball prevented Duncan from reaching MLB. Amateur career Duncan attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey, which is also the alma mater of the Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Rick Porcello.Yankee Profile: Eric Duncan, Scranton/Wilkes- Barre Yankees, dated May 1, 2007. Accessed May 14, 2007. \\"Duncan attended Seton Hall Prep, the oldest Catholic college preparatory school in New Jersey, founded in 1856.\\" Professional career Duncan was selected by the Yankees in the first round (27th overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. Prior to the 2005 season, Baseball America named Duncan the Yankees' 2005 top prospect, and the 36th best prospect in baseball. Prior to the 2006 season, Baseball America ranked him the 86th best prospect in baseball. Duncan was drafted as a third baseman, but was converted into a first baseman while in the Yankee organization, due to the long-term contract of Yankee Alex Rodriguez. However, Duncan began to struggle when he reached Triple-A. After the 2009 season, the Yankees released Duncan. He spent the 2010 season in the Atlanta Braves organization, playing for the Double-A Mississippi Braves. Duncan signed a minor league contract with an invitation to 2011 spring training with the Colorado Rockies. He was released on April 4. On April 19, Duncan was signed to a minor league contract by the St. Louis Cardinals and assigned to Double-A Springfield.MLB Transactions, MLB.com. He signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals on November 16, 2011 and was assigned to the Double A Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Texas League). He suffered a torn quadriceps during spring training in 2012 and returned to the field on May 5. In July 2012, he announced his voluntary retirement.

Endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands, it is common and widespread in shrubland, woodland, and other habitats on most islands in the archipelago. It commonly feeds on small seeds and parasites from the skins of Gal√°pagos land and marine iguanas and Gal√°pagos tortoises. Taxonomy and systematics The small ground finch is one of Darwin's finches, a group of closely related birds which evolved on the Gal√°pagos Islands. The group is related to the Tiaris grassquits, which are found in South America and the Caribbean. When Charles Darwin first collected the species in 1835, he thought it was a finch. John Gould, who officially described Darwin's specimens, agreed, placing it in the genus Fringilla with the Old World finches. By 1841, Gould had changed his mind, moving this and five other species into the new genus Geospiza ‚Äî still a genus of finches, but distinct from those of the Old World. DNA research has now shown that all of Darwin's \\"finches\\" are actually tanagers. The name Geospiza is a combination of the Greek words geo-, meaning \\"ground-\\", and spiza, meaning finch. The specific name fuliginosa is late Latin for \\"sooty\\". It is known to hybridize (rarely) with the medium ground finch. Description The small ground finch is the smallest of the ground finches, measuring in length. Its beak is short and pointed, with a slightly curved culmen. On average, its beak is smaller than that of the medium ground finch, but there is a significant overlap in size between the two, particularly on islands where only one of the two species exists. On islands where the two species compete directly, the difference between their beaks are greater. The male is black with white-tipped undertail coverts, while the female and young are brown with streaked underparts. There are observable phenotypic differences between finches that live in lowlands and ones that live in highlands, and this change is most likely attributed to adaptation.http://osu.worldcat.org/title/adaptive-divergence-in-darwins-small- ground-finch-igeospiza-fuliginosai-divergent-selection-along-a- cline/oclc/5164006122&referer;=brief_results The finches seen in highlands have larger, more pointed beaks and smaller feet and claws compared to the lowland variety. These finches are on a cline (series of biocommunities on a continuous gradient), and individuals in the hybrid zone have intermediate traits. This is an example of parapatric speciation, where the elevation gradient of 560 meters causes differentiation in traits, but hybrids are well adapted in their ‚Äúhybrid zone.‚Äù Sulloway, F, & Kleindorfer, S (2013). Adaptive Divergence in Darwin's Small Ground Finch (Geospiza fuliginosa): Divergent Selection along a Cline. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 110, 45-59. Habitat and range Like all but one of the other Darwin's finches, the small ground finch is endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands. Abundant and widespread, it is found on every island in the archipelago except for the Genovesa, Wolf and Darwin islands. It is most common in arid coastal and transition areas, though it moves into the highlands following the breeding season. Behavior Feeding Like the other Gal√°pagos ground finches, the small ground finch is an omnivore with a preference for vegetable matter. It feeds primarily on the ground or in low vegetation, eating seeds, buds, flowers, leaves and the occasional insect. It forms symbiotic relationships with Gal√°pagos tortoises and both marine and Gal√°pagos land iguanas by gleaning parasites from their skins. Voice The small ground finch's song is rapid and weak and is transcribed as \\"twichooo-twichooo\\" or \\"teur-weee\\". Conservation and threats Although the population size of the small ground finch has not been quantified, it is described as common across the Gal√°pagos, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists it as a species of Least Concern. Its numbers seem to be stable, and neither its population size nor its range size appear to approach thresholds for concern. However, like all endemic wildlife on the Gal√°pagos Islands, it is impacted by some human activities, including fires, overgrazing by domestic and feral animals, and the introduction of exotic species. It is found in ten of the Important Bird Areas established on the islands. The species suffers from high mortality rates from the parasitic fly, ranging from 16% to 95% over a four- year period (2002-2006).O'connor, J, & Robertson, J (2014).

Hot Spot requires two infra-red cameras on opposite sides of the ground above the field of play that are continuously recording an image. Any suspected nick or bat/pad event can be verified by examining the infrared image, which usually shows a bright spot where contact friction from the ball has elevated the local temperature. Where referrals to an off-field third umpire are permitted, the technology is used to enhance the on-field umpire's decision-making accuracy. Where referrals are not permitted, the technology is used primarily as an analysis aid for televised coverage.http://www.9perth.com.au/News/item126.aspxNew Invention in cricket broadcasting ‚Äì \\"Hot Spot\\". -> Itsonlycricket, is only cricket!CricketSafari.com: The Leading Cricket Safari Site on the Net  Use  Its principal application in cricket is in deciding whether the ball has struck the batsman's bat or pad ‚Äì this determination being critical in determining if a batsman is out or not on appeal for LBW or caught. In considering whether a batsman is out when the ball strikes bat then caught by a member of the fielding team or caught in front of the stumps when ball hits pad, one of the most difficult decisions is whether the ball struck the pad only, or the bat only, or (if it struck both) whether the pad or the bat was struck first. If the ball strikes the bat only, or strikes the bat followed by the pad, then the batsman could be out caught but not LBW. If the ball strikes the pad in front of the stumps or inline with stumps, then the batsman could be out LBW but not caught. If the ball strikes the pad followed by the bat, then the batsman could be out LBW or out caught if a fielder catches the ball. The batsman's bat and pad are often close together, and it can be very hard to determine by eye which was struck first, whereas the hotspot technology can often resolve the question. Hot-spot imagery is also used to show which part of the cricket bat hit the ball, as ideally the batsmen try to \\"middle\\" the ball i.e. hit it where the sweet spot lies. Hot spot camera provides some valuable information while analysing the strokes played by a batsman.  Mechanism  Hot Spot uses two infra-red cameras positioned at either end of the ground.Cricinfo: ICC expands referral trials to include Hot Spot These cameras sense and measure heat from friction generated by a collision, such as ball on pad, ball on bat, ball on ground or ball on glove. Using a subtraction technique a series of black-and-white negative frames is generated into a computer, precisely localising the ball's point of contact.  History  Hot Spot uses technology developed in the military for tank and jet fighter tracking. The technology was adapted for television by BBG Sports, the Australian company responsible for the Snickometer. The technology was first used during the first Test match of the 2006-07 Ashes at the Gabba, on 23 November 2006. The ICC announced that Hot Spot images would be available for use as part of its ongoing technology trial during the second and third Tests (March 2009) in South Africa. The system was to be available to the third umpire in the event of a player referral. For the 2012 season BBG Sport introduced a new generation of HOT Spot using the very high performance SLX- Hawk thermal imaging camerashttp://www.leonardocompany.com/-/slx-hawk-1 provided by UK based Selex ES. These cameras provided sharper images with improved sensitivity and much less motion blur than earlier HOT Spot technologies.Technology in cricket : Technology in cricket: New cameras should capture faintest of edges, says Hot Spot inventor  Cricket News  Global  ESPN Cricinfo As a result, the latest HOT Spot system is able to detect much finer edge nicks than in previous seasons, essentially ending all earlier doubts about the capability of the technology. Following the success of this updated HOT Spot system, BBG Sport and SELEX Galileo (than Selex ES, in turn merged in Finmeccanica since 2016, than called Leonardo S.p.A.) signed an exclusivity agreement for the supply of SLX-Hawk cameras for HOT Spot in cricket and other sports.  Comparison  Hot Spot has two main advantages over its competing technology, the Snickometer and Ultra Edge, which are sound-detection based system. These two systems often produce inconclusive results indicating contact (potentially any combination of bat, pad, feet shuffling, bat handle squeak) only, whereas the Hot Spot clearly shows exactly what that ball striked. Independent testing has shown Snickometer and other competing sound based technologies are susceptible to the concept of the \\"Phantom Snick\\", where the sound of the ball whooshing past the bat sometimes creates a sound, even when the ball does not touch the bat.

History The establishment of TiKL can be traced back in 1926. In 1927, The Federated Malay State Government Trade School was created after the Federated Malay States government wished to train skilled workers in technical fields by Mr Noel Leembruggen, an ILO officer and engineer and Mr. Geary, a superintendent. The first site for the school was located at Jalan Kolam Air with only seven staff. In 1946, the school changed its name to Junior Technical Trade School with enrolment of 80 students. Its name was changed again to Technical Institute after the Report of the Education Committee in 1956 (known as 'Penyata Razak') which also suggested that the school transform into a full secondary school which offered its students basic technical skill for the Lower Certificate of Education (LCE) holders. The first batch of students for the Technical Institute was enrolled in February 1957 with Mr. Lai Nyen Foo as the principal. The teachers then were Mr Rozario, Mr Takashi Mori Jr., Mr.Vivien Voo, Mr. Lee Hoch Siew. Mr Leembruggen (1957/58), Mr Wong, Mr Cheong, Mr. Danial, Mr. Zaki, Mr How Chin Cheong and a few more. The first batch graduated in December 1959. Finally in 1962, the school changed its name to Sekolah Menengah Teknik Kuala Lumpur. In 1967 TiKL moved out from Jalan Kolam Air to Jalan Tenteram (now known as Jalan Yaacob Latiff), Bandar Tun Razak. Other institutions located along this road are Sekolah Menengah Sains Alam Shah (previously Sekolah Alam Shah which was then moved to Putrajaya and changed its name to Sekolah Sultan Alam Shah) and Sekolah Menengah Sains Selangor.

De Rooij was a professional rider from 1980 to 1990. He started his career in Belgian teams and the last eight years of his careers he served teams managed by Peter Post. He currently lives in Holten.  Biography  De Rooij won several stages in the Tour de Suisse, the Tour of Germany and the Ronde van Nederland. He took part in nine editions of the Tour de France. He was known for his strategic intelligence. After his professional career he became a team manager, joining Peter Post's Panasonic team. Later he would become manager of Jan Raas at Rabobank. In those days this was a remarkable switch due to the rivalry between Post and Raas. In 2003 he became the team director of the Rabobank team and Erik Breukink took over his position as a manager of the team. De Rooij partially switched his focus to recruiting. In the 2007 Tour de France De Rooij had to make the decision to withdraw Michael Rasmussen from the Tour, while he was leading the general classifications. Rasmussen had won two stages and was only a few flat stages away from Paris, but had been chased by the press and anti doping agencies since his first win on stage 8. The reason for the withdrawal of Rasmussen by De Rooij was because Rasmussen lied about his location during training prior to the Tour de France. Former rider and journalist Davide Cassani recognized him in Italy, while Rasmussen told the UCI and Rabobank he was in Mexico. When confronted with this accusation, according to initial press reports, Rasmussen admitted the facts to his team leader, which resulted in Rasmussen's removal from the team and the Tour. Rasmussen himself denied that he had admitted any such thing, at the same time stating that Rabobank manager Theo de Rooij was a desperate man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Staehelin, Jacob. Michael Rasmussen: Jeg er gr√¶def√¶rdig, B.T. Tour section, p. 3, July 26, 2007. Only one day later, on 27 July, de Rooij informed Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, that he would resign from his job when the 2007 Tour de France ended. Theo de Rooij's farewell to the Rabobank Cycling teams came with a remarkable roll of honor. It took De Rooij only twelve years to 'produce': 6 World Championships, 81 national championships, 10 victories World Cup Classics and 27 stage victories in the three Grand Tours - Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. In total, Theo de Rooij was involved in no less than 1738 victories of the Rabobank Cycling teams. In 2008 he joined the board of the Tour of Overijssel. Since 2009, he also acted as race director. In addition, De Rooij formed along with Erben Wennemars and Jos de Koning the 'Langebaan' team (long track speed skating), in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics. On 30 March 2009 De Rooij presented his biography 'beZield'. He handed over the first copy to Peter Post. Since 2010, an amateur classic has been named after him: Theo de Rooij Classic. The classic goes right through the heart of Overijssel. The Theo de Rooij Classic is also a fund raiser for a hospice in his hometown Rijssen-Holten. Theo de Rooij is president of the Club '48, an association of approximately 100 successful former racers. Together, they present the annual 'Gerrit Schulte Trophy', for the best Dutch cyclists. The presentation of the annual awards, traditionally takes place at a prestigious gala evening. De Rooij took over the gavel at Club '48 from his teacher Peter Post. Theo de Rooij's company 'Royal Sport Management' assists cyclists in their professional careers. One of the riders De Rooij has under his wings, is the highly talented Robert Gesink. Together with his business partner Joop Schuiling, Theo de Rooij incorporated his wide experience as a rider, team leader and manager in the production of special revolutionary electric bicycles: TdR Bikes. Under the brand name TdR, the Flox and the FloxX are manufactured in Asia. The bikes are assembled in the Netherlands. Already at the launch, the TdR Bikes concept was a worldwide hit. For the technological innovations, TdR Bikes was both in 2011 and 2012 decorated at major international cycling trade shows. During Eurobike 2011 in Germany, TdR Bikes received a prestigious Gold Award for innovation, while at Taipei Cycle, there was the honour of a D&I; Award for both development and innovation.

Background Arthur \\"J.R.\\" Warren (1974 - July 3, 2000) resided in Grant Town, West Virginia. Warren lived with learning disabilities and a birth defect that caused him to be born with several fingers missing on one hand. He was widely regarded in his community as a \\"soft spoken\\" young man. At 16, he came out to his mother and the minister at his church, and found acceptance and support with both. After his death, his mother‚ÄîBrenda Warren‚Äîaddressed a hate crimes rally in Washington, D.C. and lobbied for the inclusion of sexual orientation in West Virginia's hate crimes law. With his parents, Warren was a regular churchgoer, and attended the Missionary Baptist assembly‚Äîwhich split from the Southern Baptists over support for slavery. He also attended meetings of a gay student group at nearby Fairmont State College. Meeting Warren left his parents' home around 11:30 p.m. on July 3, 2000, to watch the Fourth of July fireworks in Grant Town.Man beaten, run over in West Virginia Murder, Gay People's Chronicle, July 14, 2000 His mother said she reminded him of his 12:30 a.m. curfew, and when he had not returned home by 2:30 a.m. she assumed he was spending the night at a friend's.\\"A Mother's Faith, The Advocate, January 16, 2001 Instead of attending the fireworks, Warren went to meet with 17-year-old David Parker, an acquaintance, at an empty house owned by Parker's family. Parker was painting the house, along with his 17-year-old cousin Jared Wilson and 15-year-old Jason Shoemaker. While there, the four drank beer, smoked marijuana, and huffed gasoline fumes, inhaling them in order to get high.\\"Final J.R.Warren killer gets 20 years,\\" Gay People's Chronicle, August 24, 2002 Parker reportedly asked Warren to bring cigarettes, condoms, porn, and Xanax, the latter of which Warren had been prescribed as an anti-anxiety medication. Warren reportedly brought both cigarettes and Xanax to the house, where the other three boys began to crush and snort the tablets. Murder An argument ensued at the house when Parker accused Warren of spreading a rumor that the two had a sexual relationship. Warren denied doing so. The Associated Press reported that \\"sources close to the story\\" said that Parker and Warren had a sexual relationship and that Warren had also had a sexual relationship with Wilson. Marion County Prosecutor G. Richard Brunner later said the allegations of sexual activity were hearsay. The AP stood by its story. Parker's attorney would later claim that Parker had been sexually involved with Warren 30 times since he was 10 years old, and that Warren had given Parker drugs and alcohol before most of their encounters.\\"Teen Pleads Guilty in Gay Slay,\\" ABC News, July 19, 2001 At some point during the argument, Parker and Wilson began beating Warren and kicking him with steel-toed boots. Shoemaker witnessed the beating but did not participate. Court documents record that Parker later said Shoemaker egged him on to confront Warren. Afterwards, the three boys put a bloodied Warren in Parker's car. Parker drove and Shoemaker sat in the front seat while Jared sat in back with Warren. Warren was still conscious enough to repeatedly ask to be taken home. Near the edge of town, Parker and Wilson removed Warren's body from the car and placed it in the road while Shoemaker remained in the car. Parker then ran over Warren with his car a total of four times, to disguise the death as a hit-and- run. The three boys then returned to the house where the assault had taken place, cleaned up the blood and disposed of their bloodied clothes by burning them with gasoline. Parker then huffed the fumes from the gasoline. Warren's body was discovered by a newspaper carrier at 5:30 a.m., by the side of County Route 17 in Grant Town. Confession Though threatened with death by Parker and Wilson if he revealed the murder, Shoemaker told his mother, Norma Shoemaker, about the murder. Norma Shoemaker called the police later that morning. Police had initially believed Warren was the victim of a hit-and-run accident, but switched to a homicide investigation upon receiving Norma Shoemaker's call. Parker and Wilson were arrested while attending an Independence Day celebration with their families. They were reported to have confessed to Warren's murder. Because the suspects were minors, law enforcement officers were prohibited from discussing the content of their confessions. Marion County Sheriff Ron Watkins said there was no evidence that Warren's murder was a hate crime, but that law enforcement official had not ruled out the possibility. Sheriff Watkins later met with the president of the Fairmont State College Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual student group, of which Warren was a member even though he did not attend the college. The Human Rights Campaign joined students in advising law enforcement officials on the possibility that Warren's murder was a hate crime.\\"Man beaten in West Virginia Murder, Gay People's Chronicle, July 14, 2000. Aftermath Arthur Warren's funeral was held on July 8, 2000, at his family's church, and was attended by hundreds of mourners. His parents, Brenda and Arthur Warren insisted that the coffin be open for viewing. \\"We want people to see what they did to my son,\\" said Brenda Warren. The Warrens later told CNN during an interview that they hoped the suspects would be tried as adults and the murder treated as a hate crime. Two vigils were held in Warren's honor on July 11, one by the West Virginia Lesbian and Gay Coalition at the West Virginia State Capitol and one in front of the Marion County courthouse by the Fairmont State College gay and lesbian student group. The Marion County vigil was attended by more than 600 people, where local clergy spoke and were joined by members of the Warren family. A handful of protesters from the family of Fred Phelps, leader of the Westboro Baptist Church which the Southern Poverty Law Center labels a hate group, in Topeka, Kansas, also attended. Gay and lesbian students from West Virginia University carried white banners to block the view of the protesters. The Hearings On July 19, 2001 David Parker pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and in July 2001 was sentenced to life in prison with mercy, which would make him eligible for parole in 15 years. In exchange for his plea, a second count of conspiracy to commit a felony was dismissed. Parker also agreed to testify against Wilson.\\"Teen Pleads Guilty in Gay Slay,\\" ABC News, July19, 2001 On August 21, 2001 Jared Wilson pleaded guilty to second-degree murder‚Äîreduced from first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit a felony, -- and received a 20-year prison sentence.\\"Teen pleads guilty to Warren murder,\\" PlanetOut News, August 21, 2001 Shoemaker, was charged as an accessory after the fact, and tried as a juvenile for helping dispose of evidence after the murder. In June 2002, Brenda and Arthur Warren filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his killers. Their family attorney, Paul Farrell, said that in defending themselves Parker and Wilson had portrayed Warren as a sexual predator and themselves as the victims, and that Mrs. Warren \\"didn't feel like she had the chance to tell her side of the story.\\"\\"Warren Family Sues Teen-Age Killers of Son,\\" HRC.Org, June 28, 2002 References External resources * Matt & Andrew Koymasky - Memorial hall - Warren 1 * GLAAD: Hate Crimes Coverage Category:2000 murders in the United States Category:American murder victims Category:Deaths by beating in the United States Category:2000 in West Virginia Category:People murdered in West Virginia ","title":"Murder of Arthur Warren"},{"id":"12453162","text":"George Paxton and Marvin Cane formed Coed Records, Inc. in New York City in 1958, and had offices at 1619 Broadway in the Brill Building.

The season uses footage and other material from the 30th Super Sentai series GoGo Sentai Boukenger, which celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of that franchise. In addition, this season's team-up episode, \\"Once a Ranger\\", commemorates the fifteenth anniversary of the Power Rangers franchise. The season premiered on February 26, 2007 on Toon Disney's Jetix programming bloc. It was the first season to use high definition footage from the Super Sentai franchise, although this footage was scaled down to 4:3 aspect ratio. Unique among Power Ranger series, Operation Overdrive has the Rangers exploring, operating and fighting in many different countries around the world, rather than focusing only on their home city of San Angeles. Pre- production The early working title for the series was Power Rangers Drive Force, but was later changed to \\"Relic Hunters\\" and then \\"Operation Overdrive\\"The working titles for the series were \\"Power Rangers Relic Hunters\\" and \\"Power Rangers Drive Force\\". http://powerrangersrelichunters.com was registered by Disney in early 2005. In June 2006, \\"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive\\" was listed in an official press release . In early pre-production, on July 26, 2006, the series' logo was posted on a fan message board called \\"Fu√±aroboard.\\" (The original post featuring the logo.) This same logo was later featured on the Disney website, RangerSecrets.com, as part of the preview for the series. The logo is very similar to that of the parent series Boukenger in the basic design and format. On November 14, 2006, Disney had set up its official website for Power Rangers Operation Overdrive. Synopsis Five brave, skilled, and adventurous young people are chosen to search for several magical jewels that were long ago taken from the Corona Aurora (literally \\"Crown of the Dawn\\"), so as to prevent them from coming into the possession of Moltor and Flurious, who are brothers connected to ice and fire banished long ago by the Corona's guardian for having attempted to steal it. When the billionaire explorer Andrew Hartford discovered the Corona Aurora, they escaped their exile and rallied their allies. In response, Andrew Hartford selected the talented youths and modified their DNA so as to grant them exceptional physical powers by which to combat the evil. Although Moltor and Flurious initially attempted to work together, they soon became rivals. The Corona Aurora fell into Moltor's hands; yet without its jewels, it could not grant the owner universal power. Later, the evil warriors Kamdor and Miratrix began hunting for the jewels, as did the extraterrestrial 'Fearcats'. Now the Rangers, joined by a Mercurian named Tyzonn who joined their ranks as the Mercury Ranger, are forced to fight multiple villains and travel worldwide in the effort to capture the jewels before their enemies can. In order to accomplish this purpose, the members of Operation Overdrive are equipped with futuristic technology similar to that featured in previous Power Ranger continuities, which improves in sophistication and power with successive episodes. Each time a new Ranger, new weapon, or (in one subplot, if not more) new reason for battle is introduced, that Ranger, weapon, or reason produces the decimation of one major enemy (such as Kamdor and Miratrix) or a host of foot soldiers. Thereafter the odds resume their former state. The physical powers granted by genetic modification are seldom used, seen, or mentioned, except when one or more Rangers is rescued by their use. Throughout the series, legends are included or invented to give a feeling of antiquity: these include Thor's Hammer, Atlantis and Poseidon, who is mentioned under the Roman name, Neptune.

It was established in 1995 to provide a secondary and A-level education for students who were not selected for government schools. Enrollment in 2006 was some 1,050 students, aged 12‚Äì18. Fifty percent of the children come from medium and low income families, most of whom are receiving education grants from non-governmental organisations including religious groups, such as the Jesuits. There are also on average two international Jesuit volunteers teaching at the school each year. Academics Subjects taught at Loyola include bookkeeping, commerce, civics, physics, mathematics, chemistry, geography, English, history, economics, Kiswahili, biology, computer science, and accounting. A-levels are offered in physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, commerce, history, English, English literature, and geography, while advanced mathematics and accounting are taught at the A-level only. The school conducts continuous assessment tests each Monday to underscore its determination that its students excel although recently they have decided to introduce Comprehensive examinations for students rather than the Monday continuous assessment tests that will be done twice every month at the beginning and at the end. Departments The Students Government Council (SGC) through its 13 departments (although in most cases elected executive prefects can see through departments to eliminate or to add into the government if need arises) oversees all student activities and serves as an intermediary with the administration. Members are elected, with A-level students exercising the leadership. The Clubs Department oversees about 23 clubs, divided into the academic, entertainment, and social categories. Academic clubs include Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics (Junior and Senior) and Quiz club. Entertainment clubs include Musical Instruments, Choir, and Modern Dance. Social clubs include African Union (AU), United Nations (UN), Home Craft, Scout. and Girl Guide. Club meetings are held between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm each Friday. At the end of the year, clubs demonstrate what they have been doing and awards are presented to the top two clubs. The Sports Department conducts an A-level league and a school league, with matches played at 3:00 pm on Fridays. The sports and games involved are: track and field, netball, basketball, football, volleyball, table tennis, and lawn tennis for both boys and girls. The Academic Department mainly conducts quizzes and debates, group discussions, and career guidance meetings. The Formation Department works with the Dean of Students to create an environment where students are self-disciplined and respectful of others. The Entertainment Department enables students to display their talents like singing, dancing, modelling, acting, designing, and playing instruments, within the school and in inter-school fests. The English Policy Department oversees and fosters the use of English on campus, at times conducting its own debates, quizzes, and writing competitions. The Class Prefects Department includes 66 students who assist the teachers in achieving orderliness, and also might report student grievances to the heads of student government. The Girls‚Äô Academic Department deals with issues in a way that serves the special needs of female students. An all-female day at school each January allows girls and the women on the faculty to exhibit and nurture their special talents, potentials, and abilities. The Health and Cafeteria Department encourages healthy eating behavior for the breakfast and lunch meals served at the school. The Information Department is mainly a conduit of information between the administration and the students, and is most visible at the Tuesday and Friday assemblies. The Environment and General Cleanliness Department alerts the school community to environmental issues and conducts an Environmental and Health Day each April.

Ace took over publication with Unicorns!, the second volume, in 1982. Under Ace, most volumes of the series were originally themed around a certain type of \\"magic\\" entities, with science fiction-oriented volumes being the exception. Hence, it was known as the \\"Magic Tales Anthology Series\\" until 1995. The \\"magic\\" guideline was abandoned in 1996 when the series switched its focus to more strictly science fiction themes, beginning with Hackers. Volumes have usually appeared at the rate of one or two per year, with 38 volumes as of 2007. The stories selected for the books tend to be reprints of previously published stories, some of them decades old. Each book has a preface by the editors, along with a short introduction for each of the stories, focused on other works by the story's author.

It was released by Atari in 1991. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. The game is set with an overhead view of all the action. Unlike other Bill & Ted games, players get the choice to play as either Bill or Ted. The main aim of the game is to collect all the musical notes that are scattered around each particular time. The game starts with the player having access to only one timeframe - old Egypt. Bill and Ted can travel to the next timeframe by collecting 16 musical notes, or a phone book page.Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure instructions (Atari Lynx, US) There are different structures in the game that can be entered to collect notes, keys, or other important items that are needed. If the player is touched by an enemy, the character is respawned at the entry point of the last building or back at the phone booth. One gameplay feature the ability to use different items and instruments to ward off enemies. The player starts with the guitar, and if they collect and switch to a different instrument, the game's music changes to reflect the instrument that is being played. Another feature of the game is the interplay between eras - for instance, when in old Egypt, the player is warned that one of the items they see (the staff) has a false version and a real version. After the player travels to ancient Egypt and finds the staff, then gives it to its owner in old Egypt, they cannot travel to the next destination until they plant the warning. This avoids a time paradox. Players can save their progress by a unique 16-character password, which represents every part of the game's state. This system worked very well and saved on the costs of putting non-volatile memory into the Lynx game card. It was also possible to play a cooperative multiplayer game, with one player as Bill and the other as Ted, by use of a ComLynx cable. Plot The Princesses, Joanna and Elizabeth, have been kidnapped by Death and the San Dimas duo must travel through time to find and rescue them.  Development and release   Reception  Robert A.

It was founded in 1806, four years after Columbia's first literary society, the Philolexian Society, by freshmen who were disenfranchised by Philolexian's requirement that its members be upperclassmen. Its emphasis on debate, composition, and rhetoric was similar to Philo's literary aims, and the two societies shared other superficial characteristics as well. Philo adopted light blue as its official color, while Peithologian adopted white (Columbia later appropriated the two hues as its own official school colors). Whereas Philolexian's symbol was a rising sun, Peithologian's was a star. Its Latin motto was \\"Vitam Impendere Vero\\" meaning, roughly, \\"To devote one's life to truth.\\" Eventually, Peithologian became so popular that on July 9, 1821, Columbia's trustees resolved that \\"for the accommodation of the Philolexian and Peithologian Societies, a suitable building be erected.\\" Peithologian flourished as a society in its own right, dropping its freshman status and opening itself to all undergraduates. Indeed, some students, like John Lloyd Stephens, belonged to both Peithologian and Philolexian. In general, though, the two groups maintained a rivalry that was friendly at best and highly charged at worst. In his famous diary, George Templeton Strong recorded that a Philolexian gathering was disrupted by \\"those rascally Peithologians\\"; firecrackers and stink bombs, tossed into the midst of each other's meetings, were usually the weapons of choice. Although Peithologian's alumni included such prominent names as Columbia president Nicholas Murray Butler (Class of 1882), Nobel laureate Hermann Muller (Class of 1910), and publisher Alfred A. Knopf (Class of 1912), both it and Philolexian suffered declining membership after the turn of the century. The society ceased to exist around World War I, although several undergraduates revived it after World War II.

He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 2006 to 2018, representing Mildura. He was formerly a Wentworth Shire Councillor. Early life Crisp holds an engineering degree from Ballarat University and was a horticulturist and milk distributor before entering politics. He also served as the Chairman of the Sunraysia Citrus Growers, and was on the board of the Australian Citrus Growers. Political career Crisp came to prominence as the chairman of the Save the Food Bowl Alliance, a community group opposed to the Bracks government's plans to build a toxic waste dump at Nowingi, in north-west Victoria. He resigned his position as chairman after winning National Party pre-selection for the local seat of Mildura, contesting the seat against the Independent Russell Savage. Savage had held Mildura since 1996, and had polled more than 50% of the primary vote in the 2002 election. Crisp was able to outpoll Savage 40% to 33% on primary vote and won the seat on preferences, a 25-point swing against the incumbent. In January 2007 the Labor government abandoned plans to build the Nowingi waste dump after an Environmental Effects Statement recommended against the proposal, as well as acknowledging overwhelming community opposition. Crisp was the Nationals spokesperson for Public Transport and Major Projects from 2006 until February 2008 when the Nationals and Liberals entered into coalition. Personal life Crisp is married with three children. Controversy In early 2014, Crisp was charged with several firearms offences‚Äîincluding possession of a prohibited firearm and the possession of guns without a licence‚Äîafter reporting the theft of three guns from his farm in New South Wales. He attended a court hearing in June 2014, and was found not guilty of three charges, with another three charges dismissed. He pleaded guilty to failing to prevent the loss or theft of a firearm, and was placed on a good behaviour bond.

It includes ten species. Distribution and habitat Acrochordonichthys species are generally found at the bottoms of rivers throughout Southeast Asia. Many of the species are only known from Borneo. A. guttatus is known only from the Barito River drainage in southern Borneo. A. mahakamensis is known only from the Mahakam River drainage in eastern Borneo it is named for. A. chamaeleon and A. strigosus are known only from the Kapuas River drainage in western Borneo. A. falcifer is known only from the Kinabatangan and Segama River drainages, and possibly from the Kayan River drainage, in north-eastern Borneo. A. pachyderma is known only from the Kapuas, Mahakam, and Kinabatangan River drainages in western, eastern, and north-eastern Borneo, respectively. A. septentrionalis is known only from the Mae Klong River drainage in Thailand and the Pahang River drainage in Peninsular Malaysia; it may be found in the Bernam River drainage in Peninsular Malaysia. A. rugosus is known from the Solo, Ciliwung, and Citarum River drainages in Java; the Barito, Kapuas, Mahakam, and Rajang River drainages in Borneo; the Bernam, Terengganu, Mae Nam Sungai Kolok, and Pattani River drainages in Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand; and the Musi and Tulangbawan River drainages in Sumatra. A. ischnosoma is known from the Citarum River drainage in western Java and the Musi River drainage in southern Sumatra. A. gyrinus, from the Yom River of the Chao Phraya basin in Thailand, represents the northernmost distribution of this genus. Description Acrochordonichthys is characterized by a highly rugose skin with tubercles arranged in longitudinal rows along the side of the body, the presence of a long, low adipose fin, and a truncate caudal fin. The tubercles on Acrochordonichthys may become either greatly hypertrophied or greatly reduced at different stages of the moulting cycle; moulting is known to occur in the related genus Breitensteinia. When they are most developed, the tubercles appear more rounded and tightly packed, but are more squamous (flattened) and further apart when least developed. The head is broad and depressed, while the body is moderately compressed. The dorsal profile rises evenly but not steeply from tip of snout to the origin of the dorsal fin, then slopes gently ventrally from there to end of caudal peduncle. The ventral profile is horizontal to origin of the anal fin, then slopes dorsally to end of the caudal peduncle. The head is covered with small tubercles with poorly demarcated and indistinct margins, and the body with such tubercles arranged in 5-6 longitudinal rows on each side. The dorsal fin origin is nearer the tip of the snout than caudal flexure. The pectoral spine is stout, with or without serrations on the posterior edge. The caudal fin is weakly emarginate. Sexual dimorphism has been reported in Acrochordonichthys. Males have the anus situated immediately in front of a genital papilla, which is located posterior to the pelvic fin base. The genital opening is situated at the tip of the papilla, covered by a fleshy flap. In females, the anus is situated more posteriorly and the genital opening is located at the tip of a short genital appendage. In A. ischnosoma, males have a long genital papilla located immediately posterior to anus, while females have a conical genital papilla located immediately posterior to anus. Species groups Based on external morphology, two groups of species can be distinguished easily, both of which may be artificial. The first group, the A. ischnosoma species group, includes A. ischnosoma, A. guttatus, A. gyrinus, A. mahakamensis, A. septentrionalis, and A. strigosus; these species have a narrower head, a more slender caudal peduncle, and 39-41 vertebrae. The second group, the A. rugosus species group, includes A. chameleon, A. falcifer, A. pachyderma, and A. rugosus, in which the fish have a deeper caudal peduncle, a broader head, and 35-37 vertebrae. Acrochordonichthys species are cryptically colored. The colouration is extremely variable, particularly in the A. rugosus group; colouration is less variable in the A. ischnosoma species group. Most have a light-brown saddle extending for the length of the adipose fin and some have spots on the side of the body in place of the saddle. Variation in colouration may be due to moulting of the skin. However, even though the colouration is highly variable, some general patterns are evident that allows colour to be a useful diagnostic character when variation is taken into account. In the A. ischnosoma species group, variation in colouration is restricted to the dorsal surface of the head, which ranges from light to chocolate brown. The body colouration is less variable. In A. ischnosoma, a series of longitudinal chocolate brown patches arranged to form a faintly reticulate pattern is present in all specimens observed. A. guttatus is easily differentiated from other members of the A. ischnosoma group by a slender (vs. moderately thick) humeral process (maximum width 10.0-11.8% its length vs. 13.2-18.4). A. mahakamensis is differentiated from other members of its group by a rounded (vs. angular) anterior margin of the anal fin, and a more slender body. A. septentrionalis can be differentiated by members of the A. ischnoma group by a smaller dorsal to adipose distance (4.4-5.7% standard length vs. 6.2-9.8), fewer branchiostegal rays (4 vs. 5-6) and an almost uniformly cream colour pattern with few very small brown spots (vs. a variegated colour pattern with numerous brown patches). A. strigosus can be differentiated from members of the A. ischnosoma species group by a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin of the adipose fin and a more slender body; the genital papilla in male A. strigosus is also morphologically different from other members of its species group (short and thick vs. long and thin). A. ischnosoma is distinguished from other members of the A. ischnosoma group by a greater distance between the dorsal fin and adipose fin (9.0-10.1% SL vs. 4.4-8.7) and a greater exposure of the premaxillary teeth when the mouth is closed (one-third vs. less than one-fifth to none). A. gyrinus can be distinguished from its congeners by a concave posterior margin of the pectoral fin. A. chamaeleon can be differentiated from other members of the A. rugosus species group by shorter nasal barbels (1.0-6.0% length of the head vs. 6.5-23.9), wide-set eyes (distance between eyes 38.9-47¬∑5% length of the head), and a head with gently sloping lateral margins and a broadly rounded snout when viewed dorsally. A. falcifer can be differentiated from other members of the species group by an adipose fin with a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin and a longer dorsal-fin base (10.8-13.1% standard length vs. 7.9-10.5); generally the colour pattern of A. falcifer is also different in having many small blotches (vs. few large blotches) of various shades of brown, with many small dark brown spots (vs. no spots) on the dorsal surfaces of the head. Both A. falcifer and A. pachyderma lack serrations on the pectoral spine, but the two species can be separated based on their colouration (cream with numerous small blotches of various shades of brown in A. falcifer vs. overall cream in A. pachyderma) and the shape of the posterior margin of the adipose fin. A. pachyderma can be differentiated by its colouration (overall cream vs. generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown) and, except for A. falcifer, lack (vs. presence) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine. A. rugosus differs from A. chamaeleon in having longer nasal barbels (6.5-15.6% head length vs. 1.0-6.0) and a head with steeply sloping (vs. gentlysloping) lateral margins and a convex (vs. broadly rounded) snout when viewed dorsally; from A. falcifer in having an adipose fin with an angular (vs. rounded) posterior margin; from A. pachyderma in its colouration (generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown vs. overall cream) and the presence (vs. lack) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine.

The exact function of this secretion is unknown, but it has ichthyocidal properties. This secretion may therefore be defensive in nature.

At the north end of the plaza is the American Legion Mall, which is the site of the administration buildings of the Legion, as well as a memorial cenotaph. South of that is the Veterans Memorial Plaza with its obelisk. The centerpiece of the plaza is the Indiana World War Memorial, modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which contains \\"the Altar of the Flag\\" in the Shrine Room. There is also a military museum and an auditorium. At the south end is University Park, the oldest part of the plaza, filled with statues and a fountain. On October 11, 1994, the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza was designated a National Historic Landmark District. In 2016, the district was enlarged to include in its scope the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and was renamed the Indiana World War Memorial Historic District. History The origins of the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza lay in a 1919 attempt by the city of Indianapolis to lure the newly formed American Legion from its temporary headquarters in New York City. The American Legion, chartered by Congress in 1919 after World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security, and provides commitment to Americans who have served in the armed forces. Three Indianapolis veterans wanted to attract the Legion to the city, which already had the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis during November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows of patriotism. Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes out of 684 cast. The city and state then had to provide a location, and one of the promises the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The city and state reached an agreement whereby the city would pay for the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana would pay for the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Ch√¢teau-Thierry. Indiana World War Memorial Plaza, as seen from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Meridian Street is at left. Various architects were invited by an appointed War Memorial Board to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all who fought in World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. The partnership of Walker and Weeks of Cleveland, Ohio was chosen in 1923. Their plan consisted of a main memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, one of the two auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925 and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. In style the structure complimented the nearby local library. The second auxiliary building was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans.p. 192, Paying with Their Bodies: American War and the Problem of the Disabled Veteran, John M. Kinder The Neoclassical design incorporated the existing library, federal building, and University Park. One additional building was planned but never built. The War Memorial and the parks in the plaza are an example of the City Beautiful movement, which supported classical, uniform, and beautiful public architecture. The plaza covers a five-block strip north of Monument Circle between St. Clair, Pennsylvania, New York, and Meridian Streets. In 1989, the plaza was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it was named a National Historic Landmark District in 1994. The Historic District includes the plaza as well as the Indianapolis Public Library, immediately north of the plaza, and the Birch Bayh Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, immediately south. The Scottish Rite Cathedral is across the street on the west side of the plaza, and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is across the street on the east side. The Indiana World War Memorial Plaza is a popular location for celebrations, including the Fourth of July festival, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day services. Salesforce Tower, located three blocks directly south of the Memorial building, has a roof with a design similar to the Memorial's.Bodenhamer p. 291 American Legion Mall The two auxiliary buildings on the plaza are used by the American Legion. Both buildings were constructed from Indiana limestone in neoclassical style, similar to the public library just to the north. The west building at Meridian and St. Clair, designated building B on the original plan, houses the Indiana Department of the American Legion, the American Legion Auxiliary, and the National Forty and Eight. The four-story building served as the national headquarters until the second building was completed. The larger east building at Pennsylvania and St. Clair, building C, serves as the Legion's national headquarters. The headquarters deals with the mail, archives, and other internal administrative functions of the Legion; the lobbying efforts of the Legion are based in its Washington, D.C. office.Bodenhamer p. 254 Its two wings each mirror building B and are joined by a recessed central entrance. Three semi-circular granite memorials list the names of the Hoosiers killed in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Cenotaph Square Cenotaph Square (foreground) looking south across the American Legion Mall toward the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza. Cenotaph Square is located between the two auxiliary buildings used by the American Legion. It is in a sunken garden with the rectangular black granite cenotaph centered in it resting upon a base of red and dark green granite. Four shafts of black granite, with gold eagles surmounted on them, mark the corners of the square. The inscription on the north face of the cenotaph memorializes James Bethel Gresham, a Hoosier who was the first member of the American Expeditionary Force to be killed in action in World War I. A native of Evansville, he was a corporal in the 16th Infantry Regiment and was killed at Bathelemont, France on November 3, 1917. The inscription on the south side says \\"A tribute by Indiana to the hallowed memory of the glorious dead who served in the World War.\\" Veterans Memorial Plaza Veterans Memorial Plaza The Veterans Memorial Plaza, also called Obelisk Square, has an obelisk and fountain and is located on the plaza south of the Mall. The black granite obelisk was built in 1923, and the square was completed in 1930. Near the base of the obelisk are -by- panels placed in 1929 representing law, science, religion, and education intended to represent the fundamentals of the nation. The obelisk rises from a , two-level fountain made of pink Georgia marble and terrazzo. The fountain has two basins, spray rings, and multicolored lights. On the east and west sides fly the flags of the fifty states, which were installed in 1976 for the US Bicentennial. They were replaced with the flags of countries of the Americas during the 1987 Pan American Games. The square was originally paved with asphalt, but it was landscaped with grass and trees in 1975. The War Memorial Exterior of the memorial Architects Walker and Weeks planned the Indiana World War Memorial Building as the plaza's centerpiece, sitting between the federal building and the public library. Work on the actual memorial to the veterans of World War I began in early 1926. Five of the seven buildings located on the site had to be demolished before the construction commenced; the other two, Second Presbyterian Church and First Baptist Church, were not demolished until 1960. General John Pershing laid the cornerstone of the memorial on July 4, 1927, saying he was \\"consecrating the edifice as a patriotic shrine\\". Funding problems in 1928 slowed the building of the interior. Even a new contractor in 1931 and $195,000 provided by the Public Works Administration in 1936 did little to speed the process of completing the structure. Although its interior was incomplete, it was dedicated on November 11, 1933 (Veterans Day) by Governor Paul McNutt and Lt. Gen. Hugh Drum, Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army. In 1949 a local newspaper reported that the memorial was already deteriorating, its limestone scaling, paint peeling, leaks forming, and plaster cracking; further reports were published in 1961. Despite proposals to develop the area instead of completing it as originally planned, the memorial and surrounding landscaping were finally completed in 1965. The memorial's design is based upon the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the World. At tall it is approximately taller than the original Mausoleum. The blue lights which shine between columns on the side of the War Memorial make the monument easily recognizable. It is the most imposing neoclassical structure in Indianapolis due to its scale and size. Pro Patria The cubical structure is clad in unrelieved ashlar Indiana limestone on a high, lightly rusticated base, and is topped with a low pyramidal roof that sheathes its interior dome. It stands on a raised terrace approached by a wide monumental staircase. The structure has four identical faces. On each face an Ionic screen of six columns, behind which are tall banks of windows, and is surmounted by symbolic standing figures designed by Henry Hering: Courage, Memory, Peace, Victory, Liberty, and Patriotism. The sculptures are repeated on each fa√ßade. On the south side, standing on a pink granite base in the center of the grand access stairs, is Hering's colossal exultant male nude bronze Pro Patria (1929); it is high, weighs seven tons, and was the largest cast bronze sculpture in the United States. The north and south entrances are guarded by shield-bearing limestone lions, and on each corner of the terrace sits an urn. The pyramidal roof is stepped and has a lantern on top. Above the tall bronze doors on each side is the inscription \\"To vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the world.\\" On the north side is the building's main inscription: Indiana World War Memorial Military Museum The Shrine room, interior of the Memorial Building The main entrance of the Indiana War Memorial MuseumIndiana War Memorial Museum. State of Indiana official website. Retrieved August 18, 2011. is on the north fa√ßade, which opens into a large hall with Tennessee marble floors and Art Deco Egyptian themes. The museum is housed mainly on the lower level of the monument and honors the efforts of Hoosier soldiers in a timeline from the American Revolutionary War to modern conflicts. World War I and World War II are featured most prominently. Aside from firearms, it features a Cobra helicopter, and the 's commission plate. There are over 400 military flags housed in the museum, more than 300 of which are from the American Civil War. Indiana's Liberty Bell replica is located near the main entrance. It is of the kind given to each state by the federal government in 1950 to encourage the purchase of savings bonds. Additional museum exhibits are displayed on the main level of the monument. An exhibit replicating the radio room of the includes original equipment from World War II was opened on November 7, 2009. The Grand Foyer main level features the 500-seat Pershing Auditorium, built and decorated with materials donated from several states and World War I allies. The memorial also has three meeting rooms on the main level; these rooms were originally named in honor of General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur, and Admiral Chester Nimitz. In 2009, the rooms were renamed in honor of Hoosier veterans: Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, General David M. Shoup, and Major Samuel Woodfill. Above the main level is the Shrine Room, nearly a vertical double cube, high and on a side, clad in materials collected from all the allied nations of World War I. Accessed by two staircases from the Grand Foyer, the Shrine Room Stairway's American Pavonazzo marble walls bear the names of all Hoosiers who fought in World War I. On the east and west sides are paintings by Walter Brough of the leading soldiers of France, America, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, and Serbia. Surrounding the room are sculptor Frank Jirouch's plaster frieze depicting events of World War I. At the center of the space, beneath a giant hanging -by- American flag, is the Altar of Consecration, flanked at the corners with cauldrons on tripod stands. Above the flag is the Star of Destiny, made of Swedish crystal, representing the future of the nation. University Park University Park occupies the southernmost block of the plaza. It was originally intended to serve as the site of a state university, but this never occurred. Instead, it was the site of churches, a high school, and a training ground for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. In 1876 it was transformed into a city park. Surrounding the square are statues of prominent Hoosiers. Benjamin Harrison's statue is on the south side, designed by Henry Bacon and Charles Niehaus; seated Abraham Lincoln is in the southeast corner, designed by Henry Hering in 1934; and Schuyler Colfax is on the east side, designed by Lorado Taft in 1887. There are also sculptures of Pan and the nymph Syrinx designed by Myra Reynolds Richards in 1923. University Park was redesigned in 1914 by George Kessler for the park and boulevard system he had developed for Indianapolis, which included a fountain at the center. Street lamps on the walkways have acorn globes and fluted shafts, and two of them decorated with lions' heads stand on the backs of metal turtles. Depew Memorial Fountain Depew Memorial Fountain The Depew Memorial Fountain is a free standing fountain completed in 1919. It is composed of multiple bronze figures arranged on a five-tier granite stone base with three basins. The bronze sculptures depict fish, eight children dancing, and a woman on the topmost tier dancing and playing cymbals. The dimensions are approximately 25 x 45 x . The fountain was commissioned in memory of Dr. Richard J. Depew by his wife, Emma Ely, following Dr. Depew's death in 1887. When Mrs. Depew died in 1913, she had bequeathed $50,000 from her estate to the city of Indianapolis for the erection of a fountain in memory of her husband \\"in some park or public place where all classes of people may enjoy it.\\" The original design was created by Karl Bitter, who was killed in a traffic accident in 1915 before the work could be finished. Following Bitter's overall design, Alexander Stirling Calder created the bronze figures and the fountain. Architect Henry Bacon designed the fountain's setting. A memorial plaque on south side of the large granite basin reads \\"Depew Memorial Fountain. A gift to Indianapolis from Emma Ely Depew in memory of her husband Richard Johnson Depew M.D. whose long and honorable life was spent in untiring service to his fellow men.\\" References External links *National Park Service site on the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza *Indiana War Memorial Museum *Indiana War Memorial Plaza Historic District Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1965 Category:National Historic Landmarks in Indianapolis Category:World War I memorials in the United States Category:Museums in Indianapolis Category:Military and war museums in Indiana Category:Monuments and memorials in Indiana Category:Art Deco architecture in Indiana Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Indianapolis ","title":"Indiana World War Memorial Plaza"},{"id":"12453481","text":"WLRV is a Southern Gospel formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Lebanon, Virginia.

In 2018, Henan Normal University ranked the 1st in Henan province and top 50 in China. Henan Normal University owns one of the largest education system in China. In addition to the university, it contains attached kindergartners, one primary school and one National Key Middle-high school.  History  Henan Normal University is one of the key universities directly under the provincial government, developed from the School of Science of Henan University (founded in 1923) and Pingyuan Teachers college (founded in 1951). Due to the adjustment of colleges and departments, the university was formerly named as Henan Teachers Normal College 2, Henan Second Teachers College and Xinxiang Teachers College after the founding of People's Republic of China. And in 1985 it was changed to the current name. In August, 1948, Pingyuan Province was set up. To meet the needs of construction, the government decided to establish a new university, presently named Pingyuan University. In March, 1951, the university was named Pingyuan Teachers College, being approved by Central Ministry of Education. Pingyuan Teachers College held a grand school-opening ceremony on November 23, 1951. The college had 4 departments with 7 specialities, 485 students, 181 faculty and staff, 83 teachers of whom are more than 10 professors. In August, 1953, Pingyuan Teachers College and Henan University in Kaifeng merged into Henan Teachers Normal College with the two colleges being run separately. College 1 which was merged liberal arts of former Henan University and Pingyuan Teachers College run in Kaifeng. College 2 which merged science departments of former Hennan University and Pingyuan Teachers Normal College run in Xinxiang. College 2 had 4 departments including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology. It became the pure science normal college after being regulated. College 2 was renamed Hennan Second Teachers College and Xinxiang Teachers College according to department-speciality adjusting spirit of the colleges and universities of State Council afterwards. From 1956 to 1965, the university developed rapidly and enrolled totally 6,708 students, of whom 6,007 graduated. It fostered a great number of qualified talents and supported the national economic construction. But in the ten-year Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), the university was seriously destroyed. After ‚ÄúGang of Four‚Äù was crushed in 1976, especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of CPC, the university began to walk onto a development road through bringing out of chaos and carrying out a series of development and reform work. From 1975, the university recovered liberal arts and entered the building and developing commonly period of liberal arts and science department, but the science department was taken as the dominant factor in the sides of department offered. To fit in with Henan‚Äôs economic and educational situations and meet the needs of talents, Xinxiang Teachers College was renamed Henan Normal University in June 1985. So far it has become a comprehensive normal university with bigger scale, varied form and complete subjects and courses.

It runs north from Brigham City to Collinston (northeast of Tremonton). The highway was originally State Route 69, but was renumbered in 1993 due to sign theft caused by the sexual connotation of the number. Route description Starting in the north end of Brigham City at the east edge of the Bear River Valley, the route travels north through Harper Ward for approximately one mile until it reaches the west edge of the Wellsville Mountains. The route then continues through Harper Ward, turning north- northwest to follow along the edge of the mountain range. Upon reaching the city of Honeyville, it resumes a more northerly direction through Crystal Springs, Madsen, and Deweyville, before ending in Collinston. History Signage used from 1966 to 1977 between Deweyville and Logan The Utah State Road Commission took over maintenance of State Route 69 from Brigham City via Collinston to Logan on May 12, 1931. The route began at the present SR-13 - then US-30S - in Brigham City, and ran north on the east side of the valley to Collinston. There it turned east over Beaver Dam Summit to the north of the Wellsville Mountains, and crossed the Cache Valley to US-91 in Logan. This remained the route of SR-69 until the 1977 renumbering, though in 1966 SR-30 became the \\"state signed guide number\\" northeast of the junction with SR-102 in Deweyville, in order to provide a continuous signed route across the northern counties of Utah.Utah Department of Transportation, Route 30 history, updated October 2005Utah Department of Transportation, Route 69 history, updated October 2005 On May 20, 1977, the portion that had been signed as SR-30 since 1966 was officially renumbered as part of SR-30, truncating SR-69 to a Brigham City (SR-13) to Deweyville (SR-30) highway. The Department of Transportation passed a resolution on March 24, 1989, recommending that the State Legislature modify SR-30 to run west from Collinston to the under- construction I-15, partially restoring the portion of SR-69 that had been eliminated in 1977. The Legislature approved the change in 1991, after this part of I-15 - the last Interstate section in Utah - opened on November 20, 1990.Deseret News, The Finish Line: Tremonton-Plymouth Portion of Interstate Finished, 18 Years Late, November 18, 1990 The popular SR-69 sign In 1993, the director of UDOT's District One, which included SR-69, requested a renumbering, due to problems with sign theft: > \\"The SR-69 route signs have become a collectors' item for a large number of > individuals, resulting in a large expense for us in replacing the signs. We > suspect it is college students that are taking most of the signs, as there > is a very significant loss in SR-69 sign panels during the college school > year. We lose approximately 35 sign panels each year from this route. Often, > the post is also damaged - requiring replacement. We do not experience > losses anywhere close to this magnitude on any other route.\\" The Utah Transportation Commission approved the request, changing the number from 69 to 38 (which had been unused since 1975) on October 15, 1993; signs were replaced in April 1994.Salt Lake Tribune, Racy Route 69 Gets New Number, April 15, 1994 No changes of any significance have been made since then.Utah Department of Transportation, Route 38 history, updated October 2005 Major intersections References External links 038 038 Utah State Route 038 ","title":"Utah State Route 38"},{"id":"12453602","text":"The Malaysia national field hockey team (nicknamed Speedy Tigers) is made up of the best field hockey players in Malaysia.

He was born in Santiago, Cuba, on June 25, 1841.Sitio Web de Cubavision Internacional (De la Prensa) A former carpenter, he later became a black folk hero, renowned for ending the business of slavehunter Miguel P√©rez C√©spedes. His father, Narciso Veranes, was a freed slave and did not want his children have his name, so Guillerm√≥ took his mother's last name, Dominga Moncada. He learnt to read and write when he was a child and later turn out to be a writer. he became a carpenter, a job with which he could earn money for his living.  Activities in Revolution  Guillermo Moncada, could improve in the Cuban Revolution and fought for independence. He became a notable black officer in three wars against Spain (1868‚Äì1878, 1879‚Äì1880, 1895‚Äì1898). Jos√© Mart√≠ appointed him head of the easternmost province of the country during the preparation of the War of 1895. After giving the order for the uprising to this province, Guillerm√≥n moved to Alto Songo, where he rose at dawn on February 24. The Moncada Barracks entered history again on July 26, 1953, when the Moncada Barracks was attacked by a group of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro Ruz.  Ten year war (1868-1878)  His comrades in the army called him Guillerm√≥n, for his stature and courage in battles The son of a very poor black family, he was among the first to join the insurgent ranks in 1868 and, thanks to his bravery, he rose to the rank of Brigade General of the Liberation Army. Generalissimo M√°ximo G√≥mez said about him: \\"He has leadership skills and great strategic ability\\".  Little war, prison in Spain and other actions  Despite being one of the protagonists of the events in Santiago, Cuba on August 26, 1879, where the Little War began, he did not join until four days after it attacked the La Borgita sugar mill. Calixto Garc√≠a, being president of the Cuban Revolutionary Committee, appointed him head of the forces of the center and south of the Oriente province, with the rank of Major General.  Tribute  In his honor, the barracks where the No. 1 Regiment of Santiago de Cuba was located, was named after him.  Death  Guillermo Moncada died in 1895 of tuberculosis in his camp in Joturito, Mucaral, municipality of Alto Songo, Santiago de Cuba after years of spending in harsh Spanish prisons.

Instead of a vertical scar down the back or horizontal from the middle of the chest to the center of the back, a rod is inserted through a series of small incisions on the side of the body. The spine is not exposed during the surgery; a small scope is used instead.  Terminology  * Scoliosis is a three-dimensional curvature of the spine. * Spinal fusion is when the discs of the spine are removed and replaced with donor bone. The fusion is usually stabilized with a rod. * Idiopathic means arising spontaneously or from an obscure or unknown cause.  Qualifications  Spinal fusion is usually needed when a curvature reaches 40 degrees. However, there is a window of opportunity for a minimally invasive surgery. The curvature needs to be between 0 and 70 degrees. Minimal rib rotation and only one curve is preferred. Also, minimally invasive spinal fusions are almost always only done in the thoracic region.  Before operation  Dietary rules for surgery day Infants 0 to 6 months: # No solids the day of surgery # Formula or breast milk until four hours before procedure # Clear liquids (water, apple juice, flat 7-up, Pedialyte) until three hours before procedure # Nothing by mouth thereafter Children 7 months and older: A. No solids the day of surgery; B. Formula or breast milk until 6 hours before procedure; C. Clear liquids (water, apple juice, flat 7-up, Pedialyte) until three hours before the procedure; D. Nothing by mouth thereafter. When the patient arrives at the hospital vital signs will be taken. Also, if needed lab work will be done. The patient will then be moved to a holding room with his/her family. A nurse will then place the patient on a gurney and they will then be wheeled into the operating room. The anesthesiologist will then put the patient to sleep.  Procedure  Once in the operating room and asleep, a catheter and IV's are inserted. Since the spine is not being exposed, a scope is inserted into the body. The scope has a tiny camera on the end of it and this lets the surgeon watch the surgery as he performs it on a television. Usually, about five, one inch incisions are made and one 5-inch incision across the back of the hip. The lung is deflated and pushed aside, and a breathing tube is inserted into the deflated lung to help assist the patient in breathing. Once the lung is aside the surgeon removes the amount of discs needed for the fusion. Each patient is different in the number of discs needed to be removed. Bone from the patient's hip is then inserted right where the discs used to be. Screws are then inserted along the spine from the inside of the rib cage. These screws act as anchors for the rod. A rod is then inserted through the holes in the head of the screws. This is done slowly as to not aggravate the spinal cord. The lung is re-inflated and the breathing tube removed. However, a drain tube is inserted to drain excess liquid from the lungs. The patient is then moved to the Intensive Care Unit and then to a recovery room.  After operation  Diet: Clear liquids, clear soup, popsicles and juice. Then slowly from liquids to foods over a 24-hour time span. Nausea and vomiting: Very common after surgery, usually due to the anesthesia. Pain: The patient is given morphine intravenously to manage pain. The use of a pain assessment tool is helpful for a patient to communicate their pain levels to a nurse or doctor. Walking: Walking usually occurs within 48 hours of surgery. However, it should not be rushed and is completely up to the patient. Tube removal A. The stomach tube is usually removed once the patient has been moved to the recovery room. B. The catheter is usually removed as soon as the patient feels good enough to walk around. Most likely around the second or third day. C. The lung drain tube is usually removed last or once the flow has slowed greatly or completely stopped. D. IV's are removed usually on the 4th or 5th day. Once the patient is able to take pain medication orally  Medication  * Hydrocodone * Acetaminophen * Vicodin Recovery and outcome After being discharged from the hospital the patient will be required to wear a back brace for the first three months after surgery. After nine months to a year a patient will be able to resume all normal activity. Unlike other spinal fusions, with a minimally invasive thoracic spinal fusion only about 10 percent of mobility is lost. This lost mobility is usually in trunk rotation. This surgery is designed to let a person still have about the same flexibility as he or she did before the surgery. However, this means that full correction will not be able to be achieved. A person will still be slightly \\"bent\\" after the surgery is performed.

After ENGESA went bankrupt in 1993, the program was handed over to ORBITA, and later Mectron (also a Brazilian company). OTO Melara eventually ceded the entire program to Mectron, who continued to develop it for an agonizingly long duration --- after 16 more years and at least one major redesign, the MSS 1.2 was formally accepted into service with the Brazilian armed forces in 2009. The CEO of Mectron, Gustavo Ramos, claimed in December 2012 that the MSS 1.2 was (in his own words) \\"developed and manufactured by a 100% Brazilian company\\". Though given articles on the MAF, LEO, and MSS 1.2 by Flight Global and other news outlets since the 1980s, this is somewhat exaggerated; without substantial assistance from OTO Melara, this missile would never have existed.http://www.military- today.com/missiles/mss_1_2.htm The missile is equipped with a warhead type hollow charge and a two-stage propulsion system. Guidance is performed by a laser beam projected by the fire control system. Similar in performance to the Russian 9M123 Khrizantema, it is meant to compete with other next generation missiles. The MSS-1.2 was designed to deal with current and future armored threats such as Russian T-90, American M-1 Abrams and British Challenger 2 tanks, but can also be used against low-altitude aircraft such as helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. It has successfully breached more than six meters of concrete in tests carried out by the Brazilian army. Description The anti-tank missile MSS 1.2 is in production, waiting for placement in the Brazilian Army. Although the requirement of EB was for a missile with a 2,000 meter range, during recent tests the missile remained \\"attitude of target\\", (i.e., it was guided and impacted on the target at ranges ranging from 3,500 to 4,000 meters) \\"We put a conservative in the serial range of 3000m.

This is home to Indiana University's flagship campus. The mall's anchor stores are Dick's Sporting Goods, Macy's, and Target. History College Mall was one for the first enclosed mall properties developed by Melvin Simon & Associates Please note that the newspaper had erroneously used the date \\"Sunday, July 6, 1985\\" for this edition when in fact the actual publishing date was \\"Sunday, July 7, 1985\\". and was first opened in 1965 with just 250,000 square feet retail space. This makes the mall one of the older malls in the central/southern part of Indiana. H. P. Wasson and Company, and Sears were the original anchors. Sears was the first store to open at the mall in March 1965 with 95,000 square feet and Wasson opened later in August of the same year with 35,000 square feet. A total of 33 shops were opened by the following year. The first major addition occurred from 1969 to 1970 in which an additional 63,000 square feet of retail space was added. At this time, Wasson was able to nearly double its space to make 59,000 square feet. Notable new tenants included the 2 screens College Mall Cinema (operated by General Cinema), MCL Cafeteria, and L.S. Ayres's Sycamore Shop. Shortly after the completion of this addition, Danner's 5 and 10 Cent Store vacated their 18,000 square feet store which they had occupied since 1965. William H. Block replaced Danner in 1972 with a very limited store while keeping their Block's College Shop open at Indiana and Kirkwood until 1980. Another major addition and renovation had occurred from 1979 to 1982 in which a new wing was built and the mall expanded east adding JCPenney and L.S. Ayres as new anchors plus over two dozen other stores. Available retail space was increased by 360,000 square feet to make 750,000 square feet. During this time, Sears was able to add 15,000 square feet to make a new total of 125,000 square feet. The new JCPenney store had open in April 1981 with 130,000 square feet while the 2 level new L.S. Ayres store open in August 1982 with 80,000 square feet. At this time, JCPenney relocated from a smaller store that was previously located in downtown Bloomington. For L.S. Ayres, they increased their presence in Bloomington by building their first full department store in the community as replacement to their smaller format Sycamore Shop, a store concept that was used mostly in small communities that may not be able to support a full store, that was previously in the mall. In September 1980, H. P. Wasson and Company's parent, Goldblatt's, made a surprised announcement that they were going to close their Bloomington store in January 1981. From the time of Wasson's closing in January 1981 to JCPenney's opening in April 1981, Sears store was the only fully functional anchor still operating at the mall. Block's was able to take advantage of this unexpected situation caused by the unexpected Wasson's vacancy by moving across the hall to occupy the former Wasson's location in August 1981. This move allowed Block's to triple its size and become a full anchor at the mall. When Block's was sold by its parent company to Federated Department Stores in 1987, the Block's location was rebranded Lazarus in November of that year. The Lazarus store was later closed in April 2003 by its new parent Macy's as a part of a nationwide cost-cutting measure and the site was left vacant for nearly two years before it was razed and a T.G.I. Friday's was built at the location in November 2005 but without a connection to the interior of the mall. T.G.I. Friday's closed in November 2015. In March 2016, the mall management announced that Red Robin was going to replace T.G.I. Friday's by mid-2016. The property owner Simon DeBartolo Group spent $4.2 million in 1996 for the renovations of the 689,000 square foot mall which included new ceramic floors, new ceilings and new entrances. Also in April 2001, JCPenney left its 2 level store and closed operations. The store was demolished to make way for a new single level 125,000 square feet Target anchor in March 2004. Target previously had occupied an 86,000 square feet free standing building on an out lot of the mall that was originally build for its Ayr-Way predecessor in 1969. General Cinema eventually doubled the number of screens to 4 by 1983. After much competition with Kerasotes Theatres, General Cinema later sold the College Mall Cinema to Kerasotes in 1988 to allow Kerasotes to form a monopoly in South Central Indiana. Kerasotes quickly fired all of its union projectionists, citing a corporate policy \\"of using only manager-projectionists who are responsible for all aspects of managing the theater\\". In 2000, the 4 screen cinema at the mall was changed from a first run to a discount theater as a result of opening of a large 12 screen complex on the west side of the city. After dwindling ticket sales and the completion of their new multiplex on the west side of Bloomington, Kerasotes closed the College Mall Cinema at the same time neighboring MCL Cafeterias decided to move out of the mall to a location on the westside in 2004. Both the cafeteria and theater had been at the mall since the 1969 era mall addition. Dick's Sporting Goods built a 50,000 square foot store as a new anchor in the area formerly occupied by the cafeteria and theater to replace the old Lazarus in April 2005. L. S. Ayres became Macy's in September 2006 following Federated Department Stores purchase of L. S. Ayres's parent, The May Department Stores Company, the previous year. Alternate Link via Bloomington Herald-Times. The distribution of food services within the mall was radically changed in 2007 by the construction of a new 12,000 square feet centralized food court that included a large common seating area, new restrooms, and places for staging events. Prior to this time, food services with in the complex were scattered throughout the mall. In August 2014, Simon Property Group announced that Whole Foods would join the mall in 2016, but declined to give specifics on where in the mall they would occupy. Later in February 2015, Simon Property Group announced that to make room for the new Whole Foods store, they plan to demolish the current Sears store and build a new energy efficient green grocery store from scratch. This announcement surprised the local Sears management since Sears was the first tenant to open its doors at College Mall in 1964 and is the last of the original anchors. Simon also announced that Panera Bread and other business would occupy the yet to be built out lots that is the result of the expected Sears building demolition. After 51 years of operations, Sears finally announced in March 2016 that were closing their store in College Mall with liquidation sales starting March 25 and final closing by June. In March 2016, the management of College Mall announced that Sears building would be demolished and a new building housing a 365 by Whole Foods Market store, in place of the first- announced full service Whole Foods Market, would be built in its place but without an interior connection to the rest of the mall with an expected opening date sometime in 2017. Although originally scheduled to open on August 1, 2017, construction at the Whole Foods building site ceased in mid-June with concerns that Whole Foods might pull out of the mall if its merger with Amazon goes through. In January 2018 Fresh Thyme grocery announced it will open a new store in place of what was supposed to be 365 by Whole Foods.

In baseball, a closing pitcher, more frequently referred to as a closer (abbreviated CL), is a relief pitcher who specializes in getting the final outs in a close game when his team is leading. The role is often assigned to a team's best reliever. Before the 1990s, pitchers in similar roles were referred to as a fireman, short reliever, and stopper. A small number of closers have won the Cy Young Award. Eight closers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Mariano Rivera, Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter and Hoyt Wilhelm. Usage A closer is generally a team's best reliever and designated to pitch the last few outs of games when his team is leading by a margin of three runs or fewer. Rarely does a closer enter with his team losing or in a tie game. A closer's effectiveness has traditionally been measured by the save, an official Major League Baseball (MLB) statistic since 1969.Jack Moore \\"On the Closer Position: The Save and RP Usage\\" Fangraphs, Dec. 30, 2009 Over time, closers have become one-inning specialists typically brought in at the beginning of the ninth inning in save situations. The pressure of the last three outs of the game is often cited for the importance attributed to the ninth inning. Closers are often the highest paid relievers on their teams, making money on par with starting pitchers. In the rare cases where a team does not have one primary pitcher dedicated to this role, the team is said to have a closer by committee. History Bruce Sutter was the first pitcher to start the ninth inning in 20 percent of his career appearances. New York Giants manager John McGraw in 1905 was one of the first to use a relief pitcher to save games. He pitched Claude Elliott in relief eight times in his ten appearances. Though saves were not an official statistic until 1969, Elliot was retroactively credited with six saves that season, a record at that time.McNeil 2006, p.53 In 1977, Chicago Cubs manager Herman Franks used Bruce Sutter almost exclusively in the eighth or ninth innings in save situations. While relievers such as Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage were already being used mostly in save situations, Franks's use of Sutter represented an incremental change. Sutter was the first pitcher to start the ninth inning in 20 percent of his career appearances. Clay Carroll in 1972 was the first pitcher to make a third of his season's appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning, which would not be repeated until Fingers in 1982. John Franco in 1987 was the first to be used over 50 percent of the time in the beginning of the ninth in a season; he had a then-record 24 one-inning saves. Lee Smith in 1994 was the first to be used over 75 percent of the time in that situation. Using the save leader from each team in the league, the average closer made his appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning 10 percent of the time in the 1970s to almost of the time by 2004.Baseball Prospectus 2007, p.60 Lee Smith in 1994 was the first pitcher to start the ninth inning in over 75 percent of his appearances. Tony La Russa while with the Oakland Athletics is frequently named as the innovator of the position, making Dennis Eckersley the first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth inning situations.Zimniuch 2010, p.169 La Russa explained that \\"[the Oakland A's would] be ahead a large number of games every week ... That's a lot of work for somebody throwing more than one inning ... Also, there was the added advantage of [Eckersley] not getting overexposed. We tried to get [him] to only face three or four batters an outing.\\" Baseball teams often copy one another, following a strategy based on one team's success.Zimniuch 2010, p.143 In 1990, Bobby Thigpen set a record with 57 saves while breaking Franco's one- inning saves record with 41. Francisco Rodr√≠guez set the current record with 62 one-inning saves in 2008. As late as 1989, a team's ace reliever was called a fireman, coming to the rescue to \\"put out the fire\\", baseball terminology for stopping an offensive rally with runners on base.Dickson 1999, p.396 They were occasionally referred to as short relievers, stoppers and closers. By the early 1990s, the top late-inning reliever was called a closer. The firemen came in whenever leads were in jeopardy, usually with men on base, and regardless of the inning and often pitching two or three innings while finishing the game.Zimniuch 2010, pp.xx,81 An example of this is that Goose Gossage had 17 games where he recorded at least 10 outs in his first season as a closer, including three games where he went seven innings. He pitched over 130 innings as a reliever in three different seasons. For their careers, Sutter and Gossage had more saves of at least two innings than saves where they pitched one inning or less. Fingers was the only pitcher who pitched at least three innings in more than 10 percent of his saves. The game evolved to where the best reliever was reserved for games where the team had a lead of three runs or less in the ninth inning. Mariano Rivera, considered one of the greatest closers of all time, earned only one save of seven-plus outs in his career, while Gossage logged 53. \\"Don't tell me [Rivera's] the best relief pitcher of all-time until he can do the same job I did. He may be the best modern closer, but you have to compare apples to apples. Do what we did\\", said Gossage.Zimniuch 2010, p.97 Strategy By relegating Dennis Eckersley to mostly one-inning save situations, manager Tony La Russa (pictured) was instrumental in the development of the modern closer. ESPN.com writer Jim Caple wrote that closers' saves in the ninth \\"merely conclude what is usually a foregone conclusion.\\" Dave Smith of Retrosheet researched the seasons 1930‚Äì2003 and found that the winning percentage for teams who enter the ninth inning with a lead has remained virtually unchanged over the decades. One-run leads after eight innings have been won roughly 85 percent of the time, two- run leads 94 percent of the time, and three-run leads about 96 percent of the time. Baseball Prospectus projects that teams could gain as much as four extra wins a year by focusing on bringing their ace reliever into the game earlier in more critical situations with runners on base instead of holding them out to accumulate easier ninth inning saves.Baseball Prospectus 2007, pp.72‚Äì73 In The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, Tom Tango et al. wrote that there was more value to having the ace reliever enter in the eighth inning with a one- or a two-run lead instead of the ninth with a three-run lead. \\"Managers feel the need to please their closers‚Äîand their closers' agents‚Äîby getting them cheap saves to pad their stats and their bank accounts\\", wrote Caple. Tango et al. projected that using a great reliever over an average one to start the ninth with a three-run lead resulted in a two percent increase in wins, versus four percent for a two-run lead or six percent for a one-run lead.Tango et al. 2007, pp.215‚Äì16 Former Baltimore Orioles manager Johnny Oates once told Jerome Holtzman, the inventor of the save statistic, that he created the ninth-inning pitcher by inventing the save. Holtzman disagreed, saying it was baseball managers who were responsible for not bringing in their top reliever when the game was on the line, in the seventh or eighth inning, which had been the practice in the past. He noted that managers' usage of closers can \\"abuse the pitching save ... to favor the closer.\\" La Russa says it is important that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, \\"Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important.\\" Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth.\\" Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels.Zimniuch 2010, pp.72,156 Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed.Zimniuch 2010, pp.155‚Äì6 \\"Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong when you go to the closer\\", said Beane. He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation \\"is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation.\\" Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role.Zimniuch 2010, p.161 Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. \\"There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more\\", said Gillick.Zimniuch 2010, pp.166‚Äì8 Criticism La Russa noted that losing clubs risk their closer being under-worked, if they stick to the strategy of saving them for ninth inning situations where the team is ahead. An instance of this was Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who did not call upon closer Jonathan Papelbon in high leverage situations during the 2012 season, including six games where the score was tied during the late innings, which may have cost the team seven wins by midseason. Jonah Keri suggested \\"fear of using pitchers in anything but the most predictable circumstances, or simple inertia, closers get used far more often in easy-to-manage, up-two, bases- empty, ninth-inning situations than they do in tie games with runners on and the game actually on the line\\" and said of Papelbon \\"unless the Phillies start using him in situations where he‚Äôs actually needed, rather than almost exclusively in spots that nearly any pitcher with a pulse can handle successfully 85‚Äì90 percent of the time, Papelbon will remain the $200,000 Aston Martin that never leaves the garage\\". Some critics have noted that the 9th inning closer strategy is illogical during playoff games, especially when the club is facing elimination. During Games 4 and 6 of the 2010 NLCS, each a late-inning situation with the score tied, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel did not call upon closer Brad Lidge and both times the selected relief pitcher surrendered the game-winning run.][ Similarly in Games 3 and 6 of the 2010 ALCS, each where the New York Yankees were trailing by two runs during a crucial inning, manager Joe Girardi did not go to Mariano Rivera, and both times the chosen relief pitcher gave up several runs which put the game out of reach for the Yankees; ESPN's Matthew Wallace lamented that \\"Girardi used Rivera in the ninth inning of Game 6, with the Yankees trailing 6‚Äì1, their ship long sailed to sea\\". Hall of Fame Eight pitchers who were primarily relievers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm was the first to be elected in 1985, followed by Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Lee Smith, and Mariano Rivera. Eckersley was the first closer in the one-inning save era to be inducted. He believed that he was inducted because he was both a starter and a reliever.Zimniuch 2010, p.227 \\"If I came up today as a closer and played 20 years, would I have made it [into the Hall of Fame]?

WXMY was owned and operated by Continental Media Group, LLC. Owner arrested Smyth County, Virginia authorities arrested WXMY owner Jeff Raynor on Wednesday, July 18, 2007. Raynor was charged with one count of using electronic communication to solicit sexual activity with a child and one count of possession of child pornography. On July 19, 2007, WXMY fell silent and the WXMY website was taken offline. On Wednesday, July 25, 2007, WXMY came back on the air and was being run by Wendy Raynor. The station was then being listed as owned by Continental Media Group, LLC in the FCC database; previously it showed Jeffrey L. Raynor as owner. According to the station's website (as of Sep 2, 2007), WXMY had fallen silent. Then in October 2007, WXMY returned to the airwaves with a Classic Country format. FCC license issues In February 2007, the station received permission for Pre Sunrise and Post Sunset operations, which allows a daytime-only AM station to operate at reduced power during the period shortly before sunrise and shortly after sunset when the FCC determines the station does not need to cease operations to protect other AM stations. On April 30, 2007, Continental Media Group had applied with the FCC to increase power from 5 kW to 23 kW (Daytime) and 11 watts at night. That application is still pending as of December 30, 2007. On June 27, 2018, Continental Media Group surrendered WXMY's license to the FCC. The FCC cancelled the station's license on July 2, 2018.

These can include lifestyles based on religious, political or ethical values, as well as for self-improvement.  Characteristics   History  In the first chapter of Christopher Isherwood's 'My Guru and his Disciple, written in 1940, the writer tells of conversations with Gerald Heard concerning Heard's spiritual values. Heard answered Isherwood's questions and explained further that he, Heard followed what Heard called 'intentional living'. (Isherwood put the phrase in quotes.) Heard said that one of the hardest parts of the discipline was to be aware of one's own pretensions. 'You may rid yourself of all worldly addictions and aversions ... the most deadly pretension may raise its head. You may begin to believe you are a spiritually superior person ...'  Steps  Intentional living requires one to be aware of one's fundamental beliefs and to be willing to make an effort to have their behavior reflect these beliefs in a form of integrity in relation to his or her conscience and environment. In some cases, such changes are drastic enough that like-minded individuals group together in intentional communities. According to the writer Joshua Becker, the steps can be summarised as:Joshua Becker, \\"The Helpful Guide to Living an Intentional Life\\", www.becomingminimalist.com (page visited on 12 August 2016). Joshua Becker is the author of The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own (), Simplify: 7 Guiding Principles to Help Anyone Declutter Their Home and Life, Clutterfree with Kids: Change your thinking. Discover new habits. Free your home () and Living with Less: An Unexpected Key to Happiness (). * Realise that life is made of choices. Attitudes and decisions do not have to be determined by our past but can be chosen. * We are surrounded by a culture. We can determine its direction and see if we want the same or not. * Know who we are and what we want (to do, communicate and contribute). Give time to our passions.  Aims  Some examples of intentional living include cohousing, ethical living, frugal living, moral community, simple living, sustainable living as well as many religious lifestyles. Intentional communities, such as the Simple Way, the Bruderhof communities, the Community of St Anselm are intentional communities based on Christian values and beliefs. While not necessarily representing distinct or actual lifestyles, many themes and areas of human interest, activity, and study exist that contribute to intentional living. Examples include appropriate technology, conservation, ecology, environmentalism, humanism, humanitarianism, and socially responsible investing.

Classification  The holotype, MACN PV N53, which was collected in March 1983 by Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte, consists of two tail vertebrae, a right ischium, and a partial right hindlimb. Although classified as a titanosaur in the original description, the titanosaur placement of Amargatitanis was subsequently questioned by later authors, who noted that a scapula (MACM PV N34) and six tail vertebrae (MACN PV N51) seen as syntypes of Amargatitanis were found at a different locality than MACN PV N53 and that putative titanosaur characters of the genus were invalid.

The site was used by the Spanish, French, British, Confederate States Army, and United States Army and was part of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. During its use as a military post the site has been visited by such notable figures as Zachary Taylor, Lafayette, Robert E. Lee, George Custer, Jefferson Davis, and Abraham Lincoln. French, British and Spanish fort Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville visited the area circa 1700. France retained the Baton Rouge site until the British took control in 1763. In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, the British erected a dirt Fort New Richmond on the banks of the Mississippi River. Bernardo de G√°lvez, colonial governor of Louisiana (New Spain), arrived on 20 September 1779 and found three hundred British troops garrisoning Fort New Richmond. In the Battle of Baton Rouge (1779), engineers under Spanish Governor G√°lvez quickly constructed a siege line, enabling the Spanish troops to shell Fort Richmond; the British surrendered the next day. The Spanish garrisoned the fortification and renamed it Fort San Carlos. Republic of West Florida American and remaining British settlers in Louisiana resisted Spanish control and rebelled in 1810 to establish the Republic of West Florida. They flew their Bonnie Blue Flag over Fort San Carlos throughout the republic's short three-month life. The Republic surrendered the city of Baton Rouge to United States authorities on December 10, 1810. U. S. military post at Baton Rouge American forces renamed the fort Post at Baton Rouge. The Post at Baton Rouge served as the assembly point for American troops going to the Creek War in 1813-14 and to the Battle of New Orleans in 1814-15. The Army built the Baton Rouge Barracks just north of the Post at Baton Rouge and in 1819 demolished the former Fort San Carlos. United States Army Captain James Gadsden designed the Baton Rouge Barracks and took charge of their construction from 1819 to 1825. The soldiers completed four two-story brick buildings, forming four sides of a regular pentagon, by 1825, hence the nickname \\"Pentagon Barracks.\\" They also built a commissary-warehouse building, forming the fifth side of the pentagon, in 1821, but tore down this defective building within a few months due to faulty construction.http://house.louisiana.gov/pubinfo/VirtualTour/pentagon_barracks.htm accessed 01 June 2018. The Pentagon Barracks could house one thousand troops. The Army in 1825 established a large adjacent Baton Rouge Arsenal and Ordnance Depot to serve the then-Southwestern United States. American Civil War The United States Army occupied the Baton Rouge Barracks and Arsenal until January 1861, when the State of Louisiana seized the post and turned the operation of the arsenal over to the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy held Baton Rouge until its evacuation during the capture of New Orleans in April 1862. Union troops took back and reoccupied the Baton Rouge complex in May 1862. The Confederates attempted unsuccessfully to retake Baton Rouge in the Battle of Baton Rouge (1862). Union authorities renamed the Barracks and Arsenal as Fort Williams after Union General Thomas Williams, who was killed in the battle. Union soldiers built earthworks to protect the complex, incorporating an old Indian mound into the defenses. Louisiana State University Monument of Sigma Iota's birthplace on the former LSU Campus In 1884, the General Assembly of Louisiana passed a resolution allocating the full usage of the buildings and grounds of the Pentagon Barracks to Louisiana State University. The University gained full possession of the grounds in 1886 and the buildings were used as dormitories for the students. The grounds were used by LSU until the university moved to its current location in 1926. Sigma Iota fraternity was founded there on November 27, 1904 as a secret society for Spanish-American students under the name La Colonia Hispano-Americana. Soon after its founding La Colonia Hispano-Americano decided to change its name to Sociedad Hispano-Americana in December 1904.

He was known for his roles in shows like T.G.I.S. and its spin-off Growing Up shown on GMA Network. He later became an ABS-CBN talent, seen on several films and television series of the network, including Ngayong Nandito Ka with Kristine Hermosa. Bondoc was born to businessman Mariano Bondoc, Jr. and Milo Rivera. He is the eldest of four. He was to follow the footsteps of his father in his father's stock brokerage firm when showbiz came calling. Bondoc spent most of his high school and grade school at La Salle Greenhills. He left the country and finished high school at Port Alberni, British Columbia, Canada. Career Commercial model Bondoc was discovered at age 13 by Louie Aguinaldo, who became his manager. He made his mark as the youngest lead ever in the popular Close-Up toothpaste advertising campaign by the time he was 14 years old. By the time he entered showbiz, he has done over seventeen TV commercials and print ads for some of the most respectable brands in the market including Jollibee, Ivory Shampoo, Eveready, Del Monte 202, Mister Donut, Ayala Center and Oishi. The TGIS years Onemig entered showbiz in 1995 and was a mainstay in Viva and GMA Network co- produced shows like Villa Quintana and Ober Da Bakod. However, he only became well known when he joined the teen series T.G.I.S. (Thank God It's Sabado). He was signed to a nine-picture contract by Viva Films at age 17. His first movie in 1996 with his co-stars from TGIS, Takot Ka Ba sa Dilim? (Are You Afraid of the Dark?), was a breakthrough success. This was followed up with hit films like Where D' Girls R, TGIS the Movie and Silaw, all of which were done from 1996 to 1997. On television, Onemig became a regular host of the popular noontime show Eat Bulaga! before graduating from TGIS in 1997 and later moved on to roles in shows like Growing Up (spin-off of T.G.I.S.), Ganyan Kita Kamahal (That's How Much I Love You) and Tropang Trumpo in 1997-98. He was able to work with his idols Aga Muhlach and Mikee Cojuangco in the film Dahil Ba Sa Kanya (Is It Because of Her?). He was launched as a romantic leading man in Viva Films' I'm Sorry My Love opposite Judy Ann Santos in 1998. He also played a young man who witnessed student murders in the suspense film Sumigaw Ka Hanggang Gusto Mo (Shout While You Can) in 1999. He did his last film with Viva, My Pledge of Love, again with Judy Ann Santos before moving to ABS-CBN. At ABS-CBN Bondoc signed a five-year contract with the network and had his career managed by ABS-CBN Talent Center (now known as Star Magic). His first TV assignment with ABS-CBN was a one-month episode in the now-defunct drama anthology Star Drama Theatre. He played roles in the show ranging from light to heavy ones. Soon after, he became a regular fixture in the Sunday noontime variety show ASAP and appeared in the light dramedy Labs Ko Si Babe opposite Jolina Magdangal and Marvin Agustin. Though he was busy with television, he was not able to do movies for almost a year since he still had a movie contract with former mother studio Viva Films. At that time he severed ties with Viva and, as a result, he had to wait till his Viva movie contract expired. Bondoc made a movie comeback in 2000 in the horror trilogy Tabi-Tabi Po of FLT Films where he was paired with another former Viva talent Antoinette Taus; the movie suffered low sales at the box office. However, he made it up by finally making a box-office success movie called Trip with ABS-CBN's movie outfit Star Cinema in 2001. He was quickly given a follow-up movie in 2002, Jologs, which was also a successful hit. He did other projects like Attagirl and Pangako Sa 'Yo while working on Jologs. In 2003, Bondoc played the closet gay Wilson in the youth-oriented series Buttercup. His last TV series appearance was in 2004 on ABS-CBN's fantaserye Marina. That same year, he starred with the loveteam of Jericho Rosales and Kristine Hermosa in Ngayong Nandito Ka. At IBC-13 Bondoc signed a two-year contract with the network of IBC-13.

Vlak u snijegu has been translated into German, Hungarian, Polish, Macedonian, Czech and Slovenian. Plot At the suggestion of their teacher, fourth grade schoolchildren in imaginary \\"Jabukovac, near Veliko Selo\\", create an association and organize a field trip to the nearby town.

The children travel back alone, and the train gets blocked by a snowdrift. With the help of the children, the railroad workers manage to clear the way. Film In 1976 the novel was made into a children's film of the same name by director Mate Relja, who wrote the screenplay and changed the story somewhat: the children traveled to Zagreb, where they visited the Upper Town, National Theatre, the Zoo and a printing press. The film was first shown in Bjelovar on June 10, 1976. That same year, it received the Jelen award at the Pula film festival. It has been shown in 30 countries.

It's located in Pingyao, Shanxi province, China. \\"Rishengchang\\" literally translates to \\"Sunrise Prosperity\\", and \\"Piaohao\\" means draft banks, predecessors of modern banks in China. It was estimated to be founded during the Qing Dynasty in 1823. In the nineteenth century, at its peak, it controlled almost half of the Chinese economy and its branches were widespread throughout major cities in China, and also in some foreign countries, including Russia, Mongolia, and Japan. The draft bank is now a museum and in 2006 was included on the List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (6-484).  Rishengchang and Piaohao  Royal inscribed board, saying \\"Financial exchange all over the world\\", in Rishengchang, Pingyao One courtyard in Rishengchang A modern museum of draft banks inside the rooms of Rishengchang Rishengchang, the first draft bank or piaohao (Á•®Ëôü), originated from Xiyuecheng Dye Company Pingyao in central Shanxi.Huang Jianhui, Shanxi piaohao shi (Taiyuan: Shanxi jingji chubanshe, 1992), pp. 36-39. Rishengchang was estimated to be founded during the Qing Dynasty in 1823. However, the exact founding year remains controversial, some scholars argue it was found in 1797 or 1824. To deal with the transfer of large amounts of cash from one branch to another, the company introduced drafts, cashable in the company's many branches around China. Although this new method was originally designed for business transactions within the Xiyuecheng Company, it became so popular that in 1823 the owner gave up the dye business altogether and reorganized the company as a special remittance firm, Rishengchang Piaohao. In the next thirty years, eleven piaohao were established in Shanxi province, including Pingyao and neighboring counties of Qi County, Taigu, and Yuci. By the end of the nineteenth century, thirty-two piaohao with 475 branches were in business covering most of China, and the central Shanxi region became the de facto financial centres of Qing China. The Chinese banking institutions of draft bank or piaohao were also known as Shanxi banks because they were owned primarily by Shanxi merchants.Shanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, ed., Shanxi piaohao shiliao (Â±±Ë•øÁ•®Âè∑Âè≤Êñô) (Taiyuan: Shanxi jingji chubanshe, 1992), pp. 36-39. All piaohao were organised as single proprietaries or partnerships, where the owners carried unlimited liability. They concentrated on interprovincial remittances, and later on conducting government services. From the time of the Taiping Rebellion, when transportation routes between the capital and the provinces were cut off, piaohao began involvement with the delivery of government tax revenue. Piaohao grew by taking on a role in advancing funds and arranging foreign loans for provincial governments, issuing notes, and running regional treasuries.R. O. Hall, Chapters and Documents on Chinese National Banking (Shanghai: Shangwu yinshuguan, 1917), p. 3. Lei Lutai, the first general manager of the Rishengchang, died at his desk in the year 1849. Though his son was an employee at the bank, Lei had named another employee, Cheng Qingpan, to be his successor. Cheng Qingpan and two subsequent general managers loaned prudently, and the Rishengchang prospered greatly under their management. In 1880, the capital shareholders of the bank, at the request of Li, had created a wholly new class of non‚Äêvoting capital shares, which were named fugu (\\"attached shares\\"), for managers. These shares would let the managers of the bank reinvest their dividends back into the Rishengchang without gaining votes in the decision making process. Following the death of Li Zhenshi in 1891 his nephew and adopted son, Li Wudian, interested all of Zhenshi's capital shares. Under the ownership of Li Wudian, the Rishengchang would continue to be led by very competent general managers. Unlike Li Zhenshi, Li Wudian hoped to influence the lending policies of the Rishengchang. During the grand assessment day of 1910 (Xuantong 2), Li Wudian had created another class of shares known as the konggu (literally translated as \\"empty shares\\") and awarded himself 1.7 of these. The new konggu had full voting rights during grand assessment days and unlike the capital shares did not require any investments in silver. By creating these new voting shares, Li Wudian had made himself the absolute leader of the Rishengchang and could outvote all the other shareholders. Using his newly created konggu, Li Wudian was able to vote himself into the position of vice-president of the Rishengchang and gave himself 1 expertise share; this move gave him a position equal to that of general manager and during the expertise shareholder meetings he had equal voting rights. Li Wudian was both the top insider as well as the controlling shareholder of the Rishengchang. None of the other managers of the Rishengchang had the courage to go against and criticise Li Wudian's lending- related decisions, as he could fire anyone; furthermore he controlled their expertise share allotment as well as the retirement benefits that they would receive. When the general manager of the Rishengchang dared oppose the decisions that Li had made, contradictory orders would only add to a general confusion that plagued the bank under his reign. In the years 1911 and 1912 the performance of the Rishengchang would greatly deteriorate causing the bank to operate at a net loss. The diminishing returns caused the brothers of Li Wudian to exchang their capital shares in silver. This made the management desperate and Li Wudian had to find new sources to borrow capital from. In the year 1914, the branch manager of the Beijing branch office of the Rishengchang was unable to make good om his guarantee of a debt of the failed Heshengyuan Bank, as a response he fled back to the province of Shanxi. Later a warrant was issued for the arrest of the capital shareholders of the Rishengchang as they were held responsible for the act as the capital shareholders still carried unlimited liability for the actions of the bank. In the year 1915, under the new Chinese Republican civil code, the creditors that were owed the money would become the new common shareholders of the Rishengchang and they subsequently withdrew the charges that were held against the Li brothers. The new owners of the bank granted the Li brothers an annual salary of 1000 silver dollars. The reorganised Rishengchang, which only had a single equity class, would continue to operate until the year 1932, when the bank was forced to permanently close its doors at the height of the global economic Great Depression.  Rishengchang Code Rule  Qing dynasty banknote of 100 taels of silver issued by the Beijing branch of the Rishengchang Piaohao in the year Xuantong 3 (1911). In 1824, Rishengchang set up a branch in Taiyuan. The main business was cheques or drafts which were called \\"tickets\\" in Chinese. At that time, Taiyuan was the base camp of Shanxi businessmen's distribution and maintenance of goods. In order to work efficiently, Rishengchang introduced the world's most advanced printing technology at that time --- the \\"watermark\\" method. So Rishengchang used this method to produce and print the \\"tickets\\". Additionally, each \\"ticket\\" was stamped with a seal in the key parts. Of course, the amounts and recipients of the \\"tickets\\" were strictly controlled. When the Shanxi traders went to other province and the frontier border transaction station, they always brought the drafts which were written by the professional official in Taiyuan Rishengchang using the ink brush. The handwriting must be simultaneously bulletined and sent to other 51 branches of Rishengchang. Specifically, the drafts were executed with codes --- using Chinese writing to replace numbers and regularly changing the password method to prevent disclosure of confidential information.

The style was also used in the other keys and in the Miami area. The introduction of the conch house style is attributed to immigrants from the Bahamas. Characteristics The conch house, like other Florida vernacular architecture styles, is built of wood, and set on posts or piers, which allows air to circulate under the floor. Conch houses are rectangular, of one or two floors, and usually have a porch across the full width of the front of the house (both floors if the house has two floors). Other characteristics are horizontal weatherboarding or clapboarding, low gabled or hip roofs, and double-hung sash windows. Roofs may be metal or shingled. Conch house designs were often influenced by Classical Revival or Neoclassical architecture. Other than carved brackets and/or rafter ends on porches, conch houses generally lack ornamentation. History Stirrup House in Coconut Grove - Miami The conch house style was developed in Key West by Bahamian immigrants, known as \\"Conchs\\". Many Bahamians had experience building boats, and the earliest conch houses were built like boats, using timber framing. In the 1880s timber framing was replaced with balloon framing. Houses in the conch style were also built in Miami, in particular, in the Coconut Grove and Overtown neighborhoods. The term \\"conch house\\" has been applied to houses built in a variety of styles in Key West, but the most common usage is for houses built in a Bahamian style. About half of the historic houses in Key West have been classified as being in the Classical Revival style. The Bahamian immigrants in Key West were accustomed to building houses in the Bahamian clapboard house style. This style placed houses on posts or piers, used timber framing, had large windows and high ceilings to allow cooling by available breezes, and had louvered shutters hinged at the top (\\"Bahamas shutters\\"). The Bahamian clapboard house style has influenced housing in many areas with tropical climates.

The basketball team was established in 1992, as part of the historic Club Sagesse established in 1943 with mainly the football (soccer) team. The basketball team became far more popular than the initial football team thus making the basketball branch the most popular branch of the club, due to its phenomenal record breaking success since its formation in the early nineties in the newly reformed Lebanese league, the Arab and the FIBA Asia championships. History Al-Hikma in classical Arabic, El-Hekmeh in Lebanese dialect stands for \\"wisdom\\", thus also the French alternative name of the club, Sagesse (meaning wisdom in French). The historical Hekmeh club was founded in Beirut in 1943 under the patronage of the late father Boulos Kik, supported by late Mgr. Jean Maroun, with affiliation to the Coll√®ge de la Sagesse of the Maronite Catholic Church a leading educational institution in Lebanon and the East since 1875 but despite the affiliation with the Sagesse College the club has its own independent administration. The basketball program was founded in 1992. In 1992 the club was financed by media tycoon also dubbed as the Godfather of Lebanese basketball, president Antoine Choueiri, he wanted a team that will achieve unprecedented success and popularity in a bid to change Lebanese sports history forever and unite all Lebanese behind a successful team that will represent Lebanon and Lebanese basketball in every possible competition on a national and international level.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqhLP5zEMDo Documentary about Antoine Choueiri including a part about his vision , plans and success for Sagesse and Lebanese basketballhttp://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-3223-0-0-0&sID;=31915&&news;_task=DETAIL&articleID;=11527079http://mobile.lebanese- forces.com/2010/03/10/78018/http://mobile.lebanese- forces.com/2010/03/10/78013/ After the Choueiri takeover in 1992 Hekmeh/Sagesse included on its roster some of the most impactful player names including Lebanese national basketball team legends Elie Mechantaf and Fadi El Khatib ,notable foreigners that at the time were among the elite of foreign basketball players in Asia including ex-NBA players and FIBA world cup participants a high level of players that was never seen before in the Lebanese league and the neighbouring countries and under the management of the most decorated national basketball coach Ghassan Sarkis, a dominant dream team was born taking Lebanese Basketball to new heights, achieving the goals that were set by Choueiri such as the ones mentioned in the previous passage. http://sports-961.com/lebanese-basketball-much-antoine-chouairy-invested- building-sagesse- glory/http://www.almustaqbal.com/v4/Article.aspx?Type=np&Articleid;=397541http://mobile.lebanese- forces.com/2010/03/10/78013/ Sagesse became one of the most successful basketball clubs in Lebanon and the MENA region with 8 Lebanese Basketball League Championships, 7 Lebanese Basketball Cups, 2 Arab Club Championships, and 3 FIBA Asia Champions Cup titles..

Borges is known for quarterback development having mentored Cade McNown and Jason Campbell, both first round NFL draft picks. Borges has been described as \\"one of the best offensive coordinators I've ever seen,\\" by former Auburn head coach Pat Dye. Coaching career Early career Borges began his coaching career as an assistant coach at Salinas High School from 1975 to 1978, followed by a stint as an assistant at Pleasant Valley High School from 1979 to 1980. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1981 from California State University, Chico. Borges began his college coaching career at California as a part-time assistant in 1982 and 1983. He then moved on to his first full-time collegiate job at Diablo Valley College from 1983 to 1985. He split time with Diablo for two years in 1984 and 1985 as a defensive assistant with the USFL's Oakland Invaders. From 1986 to 1992 he was the offensive coordinator for Division II Portland State University where he coached three All-American quarterbacks. In 1993, he moved up to then Division I-AA Boise State University where his offense reached the Division I-AA championship game in 1994 and was seen trying to take down the goal posts after Boise State defeated its rival University of Idaho. In a single season as offensive coordinator at Oregon in 1995, his team led the Pac-10 in passing offense with 263.8 yards per game. The Ducks also averaged 406.3 yards and 29.1 points per game. His quarterback that season, Tony Graziani, led the Pac-10 in both total offense and passing. UCLA Borges was the offensive coordinator for five years (1996‚Äì2000) at UCLA under head coach Bob Toledo. Over that five-year period, UCLA averaged 31.9 points a game as well as reaching season averages over 40 points per game in 1997 (40.7 ppg) and 1998 (40.5 ppg). He is also credited with developing Cade McNown from an average quarterback into a first- team AP All-American and first round NFL Draft pick and personally considers McNown his biggest turnaround. California and Indiana In January 2001, Borges left UCLA for a $50,000 raise and two-year contract for the same position at California. After a losing season in which the entire California staff was replaced, Borges accepted the offensive coordinator position at Indiana where he coached for two seasons until Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville called in early 2004. Auburn Borges joined the Auburn staff in 2004. Auburn went 41-9 in the four seasons Borges was the offensive coordinator. Auburn was the only Southeastern Conference (SEC) team to finish ranked in the top 15 each of those seasons. Borges is credited with much of the success of the 2004 Auburn Tigers football team which recorded a perfect 13-0 season under his \\"Gulf Coast Offense\\" scheme. Borges resigned from Auburn December 10, 2007, after a steady decline in the team's offensive production, before the team's appearance in the New Year's Eve Chick-fil-A Bowl.Al Borges out as Auburn's offensive coordinator; won't coach in Atlanta's Chick-fil-A Bowl - Breaking News from The Birmingham News - al.com San Diego State On December 24, 2008, Brady Hoke (new head coach at San Diego State) hired Borges as offensive coordinator for the Aztecs. Borges worked as the offensive coordinator at San Diego State for two years, and helped lead the team to a 9-4 record in 2010, marking the Aztec's first nine or more win season since 1977. Borges' offense averaged 35 points per game in 2010.\\"2010 San Diego State Aztecs Football Schedule\\" In 2009, Borges was a finalist to be the head coach at Portland State.Schrotenboer, Brent. SDSU's Borges awaits Portland St. call. UTSanDiego.com. Michigan On January 11, 2011, Brady Hoke, the new head coach at University of Michigan, hired Borges for the same position that he had held under Hoke at San Diego State. Borges had quick offensive success with the Michigan Wolverines football team in 2011 and helped lead the team to an 11-2 record, putting Michigan in the 2012 Sugar Bowl, Michigan's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season.\\"Sugar Bowl victory means Hoke, Michigan headed in right direction\\" Staples, Andy In 2012, Michigan lost early in the season to Alabama (41-14) and Notre Dame (13-6). Quarterback Denard Robinson threw four interceptions and was blamed for the Notre Dame loss. Robinson was injured in the third loss of the season against Nebraska, and backup quarterback Russell Bellomy performed poorly. Borges was criticized for not preparing then wide receiver and third-string quarterback Devin Gardner. Michigan went on to win their next three games before falling to Ohio State 26-21. Borges was criticized for poor play calling in the second half, in which Michigan failed to cross midfield. In 2013, Michigan won close games against Akron (28-24) and UConn (24-21) and lost in four overtimes to Penn State. Borges and Michigan's offensive line were criticized, as starting tailback Fitzgerald Toussaint gained only 27 yards on 27 carries against Penn State. The following week Michigan had an offensive breakout game against Indiana, winning 63-47, with Jeremy Gallon having a record setting day. However, Michigan then had one of the worst statistical offensive performances in Michigan football history, losing to Michigan State 29-6 with -46 yards rushing in the game. The next week, Michigan again accumulated negative rushing yardage and lost to Nebraska 17-13. The loss was particularly troubling because Nebraska had one of the worst statistical defenses in college football. The team's offensive troubles continued through the second half of the season, leading to heightened criticism of Borges. In the final game of the regular season, Michigan regained its offensive rhythm and lost a close game to Ohio State, 42-41. Michigan played Kansas State in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl without starting quarterback Devin Gardner, who broke his toe against Ohio State in the second half. Backup quarterback Shane Morris played a solid game for a true freshman, but the offense still struggled to get things going. Michigan fell to Kansas State, 31-14. On January 8, 2014, Brady Hoke announced that Borges would not be retained for the 2014 season. San Jose State On February 5, 2015, San Jose State University announced that Borges was hired as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under head coach Ron Caragher. UTSA On January 19, 2018, the University of Texas at San Antonio announced that Borges was hired as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under head coach Frank Wilson. Borges‚Äô offense finished the season ranked 129th out of 130 teams in major college football in scoring, managing just 14.2 points per game. Their rushing offense ranked 128th, and were 119th nationally throwing the ball. He was released at the end of the season.

Winnipeg Hydro is a former provider of electrical power for the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Winnipeg Hydro was established in 1906 as City Hydro. It was purchased by Manitoba Hydro in 2002.Val Werier, \\"Winnipeg Hydro's success\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 March 2002, A16; \\"Winnipeg Hydro quietly zapped into history\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 September 2002, A5.  History  Private electrical generators in the early years of the 20th century charged 20 cents per kilowatt hour for electrical energy. The City of Winnipeg charter did not allow it to operate an electrical utility, so city alderman John Wesley Cockburn obtained development rights for the site at Pointe du Bois Falls. In 1906 the city charter was amended and Cockburn transferred development rights to the city. In 1906, voters approved a $3.25 million expenditure for development of a hydroelectric plant at Pointe du Bois. Immediately following the decision to build the Pointe du Bois plant, the price of electricity charged by the private sector in Winnipeg dropped from 20 cents per kilowatt-hour to 10 cents and subsequently to 7 1/2 cents. After commissioning the first units of the plant in 1911, Winnipeg Hydro set its rate at 3 1/3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This rate remained unchanged until 1973. Customers of Winnipeg Hydro enjoyed among the lowest electricity rates in North America. Increasing electrical demand from the city and the Manitoba Power Commission led to the installation of additional generating units at Pointe Du Bois, with a final capacity of 78 megawatts. In 1924 City Hydro constructed a two-unit coal-fired generating station at Amy Street, with a total capacity of 10 megawatts. Two more units were added in the 1950s bringing total capacity to 50 MW. The Amy Street plant provided electric power and district heating steam until it closed in 1990. During the Second World War, the city saved coal at the Amy Street plant by using surplus hydroelectric power to raise steam for district heating. In 1931 the first two units at Slave Falls were commissioned, generating 17 megawatts. An additional six units installed from 1937 though 1948 brought the station capacity to 67 megawatts. In 1955, City Hydro sold all its suburban distribution system to the Manitoba Power Commission, and purchased all former privately owned distribution within the city, becoming sole electrical utility in the downtown Winnipeg area. It was agreed that City Hydro would obtain all additional electrical capacity by purchase from the Manitoba Hydro Electric Board instead of developing additional generating stations. The century-old Pointe du Bois plant has required significant investment to maintain its facilities. An original unit was replaced with a Straflo turbine in 1999, increasing station capacity to 75 MW. Among the final achievements as Winnipeg Hydro were the recorded revenues higher than previous years. Infrastructure improvements included the completion of No. 6 Substation (Amy St) building and equipment installation as well as the completion of the installation of new underground cable to connect Scotland Avenue Terminal Station to No. 2 Substation (York) at York Avenue and Garry Street. The last Director of Winnipeg Hydro was Ian McKay. In September 2002, Winnipeg Hydro officially closed its doors and became a part of Manitoba Hydro.

The Toronto Dragons have 3 representatives while the New York Pitbulls, Nevada Lions and San Jose Razorclaws have 2. Due to injuries the Chicago Red Bears and the Seattle Tiger Sharks do not have a member representing them in the 2007 GP. The inaugural IFL GP has been marred with injuries and contract disputes that of the original 20 fighters that were set to compete only 14 of them are still on the card with one entire tournament bracket being reduced to just one championship match (the Light Heavyweight division). At the same time 7 reserved fighters were even scratched off due to injuries. Originally the GP was to determine champions in five weight classes, but the IFL announced on 11/13/07 that they will be crowning a sixth champion in the newly established featherweight division. No.1 seeded lightweight Wagnney Fabiano of the Toronto Dragons will drop out of the Lightweight GP and compete for the Featherweight title against Quad City Silverbacks L.C. Davis. Replacing Fabiano in the LW GP will be LW alternate Shad Lierley of the Seattle Tiger Sharks setting up the much anticipated rematch between Lierley and Chris Horodecki of the Los Angeles Anacondas. Featherweight Grand Prix Wagnney Fabiano became the first IFL Featherweight Champion Lightweight Grand Prix Alternate: Shad Lierley (Seattle Tiger Sharks) * Originally Shad Lierley was to face Horodecki but a toe injury during practice took him out of competition. It was then announced on 12/12/07 that John Gunderson will take Lierley's place. On 12/14/07 it was announced that unfortunately Gunderson also suffered an injury and now fighting Horodecki will be Wolfpack's Ryan Schultz. Ryan Schultz became the first IFL lightweight Champion Welterweight Grand Prix Alternate: TBA * Originally Tokyo Sabres Antonio McKee was going to participate in the WW GP but due to his participation in another MMA promotion which was a violation of his IFL contract, McKee was removed from the GP and replaced by alternate Pat Healy. A week before the GP, the IFL announced that Healy suffered an elbow injury during training and could not participate in the IFL. Taking his place is San Jose Razorclaws Donnie Liles. ** Originally Chicago Red Bears Mark Miller was going to participate in the WW GP but due to a hand injury he had to step out. Replacing him will be alternate Brad Blackburn. Shortly after the announcement of Blackburn replacing Miller, it was announced that Blackburn could not compete in the GP due to an undisclosed injury, to replace him will be Gideon Ray. Jay Hieron became the IFL's first Welterweight Champion Middleweight Grand Prix Alternate: Fabio Leopoldo (New York Pitbulls) Matt Horwich became the IFL's first Middleweight Champion. Light Heavyweight Grand Prix *Originally Silverback Mike Ciesnolevicz was to participate in the LHW GP but due to his KO lost to Andre Gusmao during the IFL World Championship Finals he is under KO suspension and thus can not compete. Taking his place is the man who knocked him out New York Pittbulls Andre Gusmao. Unfortunately shortly after this announcement Gusmao suffered an injured foot and therefore could not compete in the GP. Meanwhile fellow LHW finalist Mike Whitehead did not sign a contract extension with the IFL and thus was not allowed to participate in the GP. At the same time reserve fighter Jamal Patterson was reported injured and could not participate in the GP, therefore the IFL decided to just make this a one fight tourny for the LHW belt between Matsuyshenko and Schoenauer. Vladimer Matyushenko becomes the IFL's first Light Heavyweight Champion Heavyweight Grand Prix Alternate: TBA ** Originally Ben Rothwell was to participate in the HW GP but due to Rothwell not signing a contract extension with the IFL he was not allowed to participate. Taking his place against Roy Nelson will be Reese Andy while reserve fighter Bryan Vetell will fight Antoine Jaoude.

His diplomatic skills helped prevent a duel between the kings of France and Aragon. He served as Papal Legate in France, and was responsible for organizing the Aragonese Crusade of 1283‚Äì84. He was then a working member of the Roman Curia. Early life Cholet was born in the Chateau of Nointel, in the diocese of Beauvais. In contemporary documents (including those of the Chambre des Comptes in Paris) he is called Joannes de Noentel or Jehan de Noentel.Duchesne, Cardinaux fran√ßois Tome II, Preuves, p. 223. He had two brothers, Eudes (Odo, Odon), who became Abbot of S. Lucien de Beauvais,He is granted the right to use a mitre, ring, and pastoral staff by Pope Martin IV, on 13 April 1283: Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 135 no. 316. Pope Martin calls him germanus of Cardinal Jean of S. Cecilia. and Jean, who became Canon of the Cathedral of S. Gervais de Soissons.Duchesne, I, p. 293. He initially followed a military career, like his father, but eventually opted for the religious life. He began his career as a Canon of the Collegiate Church of Notre Dame du Ch√¢tel in Beauvais. He was then made a Canon of the Cathedral of S. Pierre in Beauvais, one of twenty-seven Canons, at some moment before 1267. He was named Archdeacon of Caux (Minoris-Caleti) in the diocese of Rouen; documents indicate that he possessed that dignity around the year 1240 (?).Jean Fran√ßois Pommeraye, Histoire de l'√©glise cath√©drale de Rouen, m√©tropolitaine et primatiale de Normandie (Rouen: par les imprimeurs ordinaires de l'archev√©ch√©, 1686), p. 398. The date of the documents is suspect. Simon de Brion had also been an archdeacon of Rouen. Cholet is mentioned as a former Archdeacon of Rouen in the list of benefactors of the monastery of Corneville: Arthurus du Monstier, Neustria pia, seu de omnibus et singulis abbatiis et prioratibus totius Normanie (Rouen 1663), p. 877.

He was a cleric of the Royal Chapel of King Philip III in 1274.Louis Archon, Histoire De La Chapelle Des Rois De France Tome second (Paris 1711), p. 182. Cardinal Cholet In a Consistory that was held at Orvieto on 23 March (or 12 April), 1281, Jean Cholet was one of seven prelates raised to the dignity of cardinal by Pope Martin IV (Simon de Brion). He was assigned the Church of S. Cecilia in Trastevere as his titulus, the same church that his friend Simon de Brion had possessed as a cardinal.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi Tomus I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 10. August Potthast, Regesta Pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), p. 1758. As a new Cardinal in the Roman Curia, he had his share of arbitration cases. One in particular was the litigation between Prior Adam of the monastery of Saint-Vincent de Senlis and the Prior, Sub-prior, and other members of the community.M√ºller, pp. 796-797. It may be noted that Martin IV and his Curia never actually visited Rome. The city was in the hands of the Ghibbelines and did not welcome the presence of a pope, even when he begged. Sicilian Vespers Charles I of Sicily Peter III of Aragon In 1282 the situation of the Papacy with regard to southern Italy changed dramatically. On 7 May, the famous Sicilian Vespers began in Palermo, resulting in the loss of the island, a papal fief, by King Charles I. The King of Aragon, Pedro I, took advantage of the revolt by invading and occupying the island of Sicily. He began to style himself \\"King\\", which infuriated both King Charles and Pope Martin IV. King Charles and King Pedro challenged each other to trial by single combat (duel), which greatly annoyed the Pope, who believed that the decision as to legitimacy was his. On 5 June the Pope appointed a Legate in the Kingdom of Sicily, Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi, and ordered him to get King Charles to abandon the plan of trial by combat.Potthast, no. 21912. Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 101-105, nos. 270-270jj; p. 185 no. 449 (28 March 1283). Bianchi was unsuccessful.Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 126, no. 302: letter of Martin IV to Charles I (6 February 1283). On 18 November 1282, therefore, Pope Martin IV opened proceedings against King Pedro of Aragon, because he had invaded the territory of Sicily and was usurping the crown.Potthast, no. 21947. Cf. no. 21962 (without date) in which Cardinal Jean Cholet is notified of the usurpation of Pedro, once king of Aragon. The proceedings were concluded by 21 March 1283, when Pope Martin publicly deposed King Pedro and released all of his subjects from allegiance to him.Potthast, no. 21998. The duel was still in prospect, however, and the Pope also tried to get the King of France and the King of England to intervene.Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 188-189, no. 452 (5 April 1283). \\"et nichilominus dilectum filium nostrum Johannem, tituli Sancte Cecilie presbyterum cardinalem, virum utique grandi scientia preditum, prudentia et morum honestate decorum, quem tsue probitatis obtentu grandi affection prosequimur, cujus consiliis te in his acquiescere rogamus et petimus, ad id inter cetera destinamus, ut tam te quam predictos vicarios et officiales tuos per se, si facultas affuerit, suos nuntios vel litteras efficaciter moneat et inducat ad parendum premissis apostolicis monitionibus, inhibitionibus et mandatis....\\" In his letter to King Edward I, Pope Martin recommended to him the services of Cardinal Joannes of S. Cecilia (Jean Cholet), a statement which is often interpreted as the appointment of Cardinal Cholet to an Embassy to England.See M√ºller, pp.798-800. The details of the letter itself, however, make it obvious that the Pope expects King Edward and Cholet to work through intermediaries (suos nuntios vel litteras) and the King's agents (vicarios et officiales tuos). In 1283 Cholet already had an all-consuming task--organizing a crusade for the conquest of Aragon. In 1282 and 1283 King Edward, too, was fully engaged in the full-scale conquest and subjugation of Wales; it was not until 11 December 1282 that Llywelyn was killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge. Edward did have time, however, to order his agents in Aquitaine not to permit the two combatants to engage in their duel in Bordeaux (which had been the proposed site), or anywhere else in his realm. His decision not to intervene in the dynastic problems of France and Aragon was probably sufficient for the Pope's purposes.See Martin IV's letter to Edward I, Potthast, no. 2205 (5 April 1283); Thomas Rymer, Foedera, Conventiones, Literae et cujusque generis Acta Publica, II (London: Churchill 1705), pp. 242-244; and Edward's letter to King Charles of Sicily, Rymer, pp. 238-240. On 4 May 1283, Cardinal Cholet, papal Legate to France, was issued a mandate to correct certain statutes enacted by Archbishop Jean de Montsoreau of Tours (1271-1285) in his provincial council of 1282.Potthast, no. 22017. The Aragonese Crusade Cardinal Cholet was commissioned by his long-time friend, Pope Martin IV, to preach the Aragonese Crusade in 1283. The date on his commission as Legate in France is 9 April 1283.Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 185-188, no. 451-451s. Each power and privilege is stated in a separate document. On 27 August 1283, he was granted the faculty of transferring the \\"vacant\\" throne of Aragon and the County of Barcelona to one of the sons of King Philip of France.Potthast, no. 22061. Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 190, no. 455. On 3 September 1283, Pope Martin ordered all of the ecclesiastical persons in France to give 10% of their income for three years to the King of France for the Crusade against Pedro of Aragon. He ordered Cardinal Cholet to see to it that these contributions were paid, even by the monastic orders, Templars and Hospitallers.Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), pp. 188-190, nos. 457-458. This grant was extended for an additional four years on 13 May 1284: Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 300-301, no. 584-586. On 10 January 1284, the Pope prodded him to get on with the business:Potthast, no. 22092. Prince Charles was finally chosen, after long negotiations with Cardinal Cholet, and Pope Martin IV confirmed his appointment as King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona on 5 May 1284.Potthast, no. 22130-22132. On 4 June 1284, Cardinal Bernard de Languissel, Bishop of Porto, was ordered to preach the crusade against former King Pedro of Aragon throughout his legation in northern Italy, and Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi, Bishop of Sabina, to do the same in south Italy. The Pope even enlisted the Dominicans and Franciscans in Sardinia and Corsica to preach the crusade.Potthast, no. 22149-22150, 22153. Cardinal Jean Cholet was also given legatine authority over the orders of friars, both generally at his appointment as Legate in the Kingdom of France,Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), p. 185-188, no. 451d, 451h, 451p, 451q. and as part of his commission to preach the plenary indulgence to all those who fought alongside Charles of Valois for the Crown of Aragon against Peter III. By 5 May 1284, Cardinal Cholet had accumulated the following 'provinces' in his Legatine commission: France, Navarre, Aragon, Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, Lyon, Besan√ßon, Vienne, Tarentaise, Ebrudun, Li√®ge, Metz, Verdun, and Tulle.Potthast, no. 12847. Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), pp. 287-288, nos. 576. In mid-August, 1284, the Cardinal presided over a Council meeting in Paris; a maxima multitude praelatorum attended.J.-D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio Tomus 24 (Venice 1780), p. 519. In 1284, when the aldermen of Lille attacked a troupe of Dominicans trying to preach the Aragonese Crusade in their town, Cholet fined them 4,000 livres de Paris and used the money to finance the crusade. In 1285, Cholet himself accompanied Charles into Aragon. The chronicle of S. Paul de Narbonne informs us that on 15 March 1285, the Cardinal accompanied King Philip the Hardi and his two sons, Philip and Charles, in their entry into Narbonne. From there they proceeded into Roussilon and entered Catalonia.Duchesne, I, p. 292. On 28 April 1285 at Girona,M√ºller, pp. 805-807. Cholet placed his galero on Charles' head and pronounced him king. This act earned Charles the satirical nickname roi du chapeau or C√°rles, rey del Xapeu ('king of the hat'), implying that he was no properly crowned king, merely a creature of the Papacy.Antonio de Bofarull (editor), Cronica catalana de Ramon Muntaner (Barcelona: Imprenta de Jaime Jep√∫s, 1860), pp. 195-196. Andres Avelino Pi y Arimon, Barcelona; antiqua y moderne: √≥ descripci√≥n √© historia de esta ciudad desde su fundaci√≥n hasta nuestros dias Volume 2 (Barcelona: Imprenta y Librer√≠a Polit√©cnica de T. Gorchs, 1854), p. 517. Compare the version of the story given by Bernard D'Esclot in his Cronica del Rey En Pere, chapter 136, in J.-A.-C. Buchon (editor), Chroniques √©trang√®res relatives aux expeditions fran√ßaises pendant le XIIIe si√®cle (Paris 1875), pp. 680-682. The remark was apparently a bon mot of Prince Philippe le Bel. It was at that moment that Cardinal Cholet made the famous remark,\\"E yo, de part de Deu e del senyor apostoli, dich a tots cells qui yran ne aportaran armes contra Pere d'Arago quels seran tots sos peccats perdonnats; e si negu n'l mor, co que Deus no vulla! que s'en purara tot dellivre e florit denant Deu; que sol ne leix la sua anima ne venra a porgatori. E l'altra porfir sus axi, de part de la sgleya de Roma, ajuda temporal en aquest fet, co es assaber.... > If any man die there, which may God forbid, then will he in shining > whiteness ascend into the presence of God, for God will not in any wise > permit that his soul be sent to purgatory. The Pope's grant of a plenary indulgence was being applied. Charles' elevation was approved by the Pope on 5 May 1284.Les Registres de Martin IV (Paris 1901), pp. 295-297, no. 581-582. But, in an ironic twist, Charles' father, Philip III, died of dysentery in Perpignan, the capital of his ally James II of Majorca, on 5 October 1285. His skin was removed and interred in the Cathedral of Narbonne. His body was carried back to Paris by the many members of the French Court who had accompanied him in the Crusade against Aragon. When the cortege reached Paris, the Dominicans, who had been highly favored by the late King, wished to have a share of the relics. They employed the Confessor of the new king, Philip IV, to persuade the king to give them Philip III's heart--which he most imprudently agreed to do. There was an immediate protest at this violation of custom and ceremonial. The Benedictine monks of Saint Denis ought to have received all the remains. Both heart and bones were separately buried in the Basilica. Cardinal Cholet and the principal lords of the French Court supported the monks of S. Denis, and some members of the University of Paris even put in their opinion, that the King should not have given the heart, the monks of S. Denis should not have surrendered it, and the Dominican friars should not have kept it, without a specific dispensation from the Pope. No one was pleased, but the Dominicans had and kept possession.√âtienne Oroux, Histoire ecclesiastique de la Cour de France Tome premier (Paris 1776), pp. 365-366. Elsewhere, the late King's uncle, Charles of Anjou, King of Sicily, also died in 1285, on 7 January, and King Pedro III of Aragon died on 11 November 1285, one month after his great antagonist, Philip III. On 6 January 1286, the Cardinal Legate was present at the Coronation of Philip IV.M√ºller, pp. 808-809, quoting the chronicle of Saint- Catherine du Mont of Rouen. E. Ch√©ruel, Normanniae nova chronica (Cadomi 1850), p. 29: cui [Philippo III] successit ejusdem filius Philippus, qui coronatus est eodem anno, in festo Epiphaniae, praesente domino Johanne tholet, sedis apostolicae cardinali legato. In accordance with a bull of Honorius IV, he settled the differences between the scholars of the University and the Chancellor of Paris.H. Denifle, Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis I (Paris 1889), no. 528, pp. 639-642 (February 1, 1286); M. Prou, Registres d' Honorius IV (Paris 1888), no. 267. In 1286 he gave the Royal Abbey of S. Lucien de Beauvais funds to purchase the land and seigneurie of Foulangues. At some point he also funded the acquisition of the fief of Maulers.L.-E. Deladreue et Mathon, Histoire de l'Abbaye royale de S. Lucien, in M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© acad√©mique d‚Äôarch√©ologie, sciences et arts du d√©partement de l‚ÄôOise, VIII. 3 (Beauvais: 1873), p. 698 and 701. But Cardinal Cholet was still preaching the pope's crusades against his secular opponents in 1286. Pedro III may have died, but Sicily was still not back in papal hands. A legitimate king was needed to swear fealty to the Papacy. On 30 April 1286, Pope Honorius IV granted an indulgence to all Italian clergy who paid in one year the tithe which had been levied for three years. In May he ordered Cholet to use the indulgence sparingly. Conclave: absent Cardinal Cholet did not attend the Conclave of 1287-1288, being still Legate in France. The Conclave began in April, in the papal palace at Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, where Pope Honorius IV (Giacomo Savelli) had died. But Rome was infested with pestilence that year, and six of the cardinals died. Nearly all of them scattered to their own private residences, trying to recover or trying to avoid being afflicted. Only one cardinal stayed on in the papal palace, and when winter caused the pestilence to abate, the surviving cardinals returned -- Latino Malabranca, Bentivenga de Bentivengis, Girolamo Masci, Bernard de Languissel, Matteo Rosso Orsini, Giacomo Colonna, and Benedetto Caetani. On 22 February 1288, they happily elected the cardinal who had stayed at his station, Girolamo Masci d' Ascoli, O.Min., Suburbicarian Bishop of Palestrina, who took the name Nicholas IV.Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1287--1288 (Dr. J.P. Adams). He wrote on 5 March to Cardinal John of S. Cecilia, directing him to assist Master Galienus de Pisis in finding a quiet place of retirement at Villa Sancti Marcelli, near Paris.Ernest Langlois, Les Registres de Nicolas IV I (Paris 1905), p. 3-4 no. 6 In the Curia. Conclave fresco in S. Cecilia, by Pietro Cavallini, commissioned by Cardinal Cholet fresco in S. Cecilia, Cavallini Cardinal Cholet's long Legateship in France came to an end in the summer of 1290. On 16 September 1290, he was back in Italy, at Orvieto, in the Roman Curia, sitting on a committee of episcopal examiners.Ernest Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV Tome premier (Paris 1905), p. 521, no. 3273. The Pope and Curia had settled in Orvieto at the beginning of June, 1290, and remained there until February, 1292. He continued working at the Roman Curia during 1291 and 1292. On 29 February 1292, he was present at a Consistory that took place in Rome at Santa Maria Maggiore to sign a bull granting privileges to the Hospital of Macadura in the diocese of Piacenza.Ernest Langlois, Les Registres de Nicolas IV III fasc. 7 (Paris 1892), p. 917 no. 6862. A total of eleven cardinals signed the bull, along with Pope Nicholas IV. On 23 March, he is mentioned as a member of a committee of cardinals who investigated the election of Bishop Gerard of Soissons.Ernest Langlois, Les Registres de Nicolas IV III (Paris 1892), p. 928, no. 6941. It was perhaps around this time that Cardinal Cholet commissioned a series of frescoes for his titular church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere from Pietro Cavallini (1259 ‚Äì c. 1330), who was also working on the mosaics at S. Maria Transtiberim. The \\"Last Judgment\\" is regarded by some as his masterpiece.John T. Paoletti and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy third edition (London: Laurence King Publishing, 2005), pp. 62-63.

Pope Nicholas IV died in Rome at his residence at Santa Maria Maggiore on Holy Saturday, April 4, 1292.Augustinus Theiner (editor), Caesaris S.R.E. Cardinalis Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 (Bar-le-Duc 1871) under the year 1292, ¬ß 17, p. 123. At the time of his death, there were twelve living cardinals, according to the Subdeacon of the Holy Roman Church, Giacopo Caetani Stefaneschi, who was present at the events.Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores Tomus Tertius (Milan 1723), p. 615. One of them was Cardinal Jean Cholet. The Conclave, however, lasted for two years and three months, during which Cardinal Cholet died. Only eleven cardinals signed the electoral decree of Pope Celestine V on Monday, 5 July 1294.Augustinus Theiner (editor), Caesaris S.R.E. Cardinalis Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 (Bar-le-Duc 1871) under the year 1294, ¬ß 6, p. 131. Testament, Death, Burial In 1292, Cholet drew up his Last Will and Testament.Duchesne, Cardinaux fran√ßois Tome II, Preuves, pp. 222-225. He had earlier, on 6 February 1290, been granted the privilege of making a Will by Pope Nicholas IV; see Ernest Langlois (editor), Les registres de Nicolas IV Tome premier (Paris 1905), p. 341, no. 1887. Complications in carrying out its terms are discussed by Pope Boniface VIII in a letter of 12 July 1298: Registres de Boniface VIII Vol. 2, pp. 156-158 no. 2625. His first legacy was of 2000 livres Tournois to the Benedictine monastery of S. Lucien de Beauvais, which he had chosen as his burial place. He left 200 livres to the monastery of S. Maria de Britolio (Bretteuil) near Beauvais for the purchase of properties, the income of which was to be used for Masses for the repose of his soul; similarly to the monastery of S. Geremario Flavigniacensis (S. Germer-de-Fly) in the diocese of Autun,S. Germer-de-Fly. A. Besnard, L'Eglise de Saint-Germer-de-Fly et sa Coll√©giale (Paris, 1913). and lesser amounts to many other religious houses for remembrances and distributions to the poor. Various legacies within the diocese of Rouen were calculated as having amounted to 33,041 livres in silver.Pommeraye, Histoire de l'Eglise de Rouen, p. 209. He left 6,000 livres Tournois to the \\"matter of Aragon\\", that is, to the war chest of Charles de Valois, the brother of Philip IV, who had been crowned with the galero, on the condition that Charles make a further expedition into Aragon. Otherwise the money was to be distributed to a long list of monasteries and religious houses, and to the poor. His books, individually named, were bequeathed to various clerics. Cardinal Jean Cholet died on 2 August 1293, according to an obituary of S. Lucien de Beauvais.L.-E. Deladreue et Mathon, Histoire de l'Abbaye royale de S. Lucien, in M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© acad√©mique d‚Äôarch√©ologie, sciences et arts du d√©partement de l‚ÄôOise, VIII. 3 (Beauvais: 1873), p. 671. He died on 3 August 1293,Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p.40, correcting his date of 1292 given at p. 8. according to the Martyrology of the Church of Beauvais. But, according to the Martyrology of the Church of S. Gervais at Soissons, he died in September, 1292, on the Saturday after the Feast of S. Michael (which is celebrated on September 29). He also died on 9 May, at the Saint Chapelle in Paris, though at S. Genevieve in Paris he died on 13 August. At Amiens, the date of his decease was 11 August. He was buried in the Church of S. Lucien in Beauvais, in the sanctuary on the gospel-side. His funeral inscription is given by Duchesne.Duchesne, Cardinaux fran√ßois Tome II, Preuves, p. 225.

The Patriot camps were initiated by the president of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili in 2005. Each year tens of thousands of young Georgians attend summer camps for ten days, with expenses paid by the Georgian government. Participation is voluntary. In 2007 seven patriot camps will operate. The declared aim of the project is to raise national pride in young Georgians and to counter social problems of the country. The participants are from poor backgrounds aged 15 to 20. Activities in the camps focus on sporting and cultural events. President Saakashvili, the initiator of the program, himself a former pioneer, rebutted any parallels to Soviet Young Pioneer camps, saying that this is as different as it can get.BBC News The patriot camps have been criticized for featuring informal military training (e.g., firing AK-47 rifles). Georgia's opposition has also criticized the camps for Saakashvili through them trying to gain political scores among the young people. Each year upon closing of the camps a large meeting is organized in the Palace of Sports, with Saakashvili addressing the Patriots.  Ganmukhuri camp  One of the Patriot camps was opened in 2007 at the village of Ganmukhuri close to the cease-fire line with breakaway Abkhazia with the declared purpose of bringing Georgian and Abkhaz teenagers together. In July 2007 the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern that Georgia's decision to open a Patriot camp at Ganmukhuri could fuel tensions along the Abkhaz- Georgian ceasefire line, with Georgian officials in response accusing Ban Ki- moon of seeking appeasing of Russia. Georgian Foreign Minister Gela Bezhuashvili and newly appointed Conflict Resolution Minister Davit Bakradze responded that the UN should concentrate on \\"major issues,\\" such as the repatriation of Georgian displaced persons referring to the victims of the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia.Georgian Official Accuses UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of seeking to appease Russia. Eurasia Insight, July 25, 2007. A potentially dangerous incident took place at Ganmukhuri on October 30, 2007 when the patrol of Russian peacekeepers consisting of military personnel and hardware entered Georgian territory and approached the camp, detaining five Georgian policemen who refused the Russians entry. Russian peacekeepers claimed that the officers had been antagonizing and threatening to shoot them. Georgia's Interior Ministry said the detained policemen were severely beaten, and had its forces in the area put on alert. Abkhazia dispatched additional forces to the border posts and put its troops \\"on high alert\\". President Saakashvili personally arrived in the village and lashed out at Russian peacekeepers for provoking the incident and declared that Sergey Chaban, commander of Russia's peacekeeping forces in the area, is persona non grata in Georgia. The latter denied that beating took place and said that he is subordinate to the Council of the defence ministers of CIS and that he is not going to leave the country without an order. Soon, the Georgian policemen were released and the Russian troops left the area.Georgia claims Russian peacekeepers apprehend, beat 3 policemen near Abkhazia. The International Herald Tribune.

The Russians claim they were also ready to hand over detained Georgian policemen, but the local Georgian officials refused the deal after receiving instructions from their bosses to wait for President Saakashvili‚Äôs arrival.

Taxonomy The tawny-crowned honeyeater was originally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Certhia melanops. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek terms melano- 'black' and ≈çps 'face'. It was previously classified in the genus Phylidonyris but a recent molecular study has shown it to be more distantly related to members of that genus.Driskell, A.C., Christidis, L (2004) Phylogeny and evolution of the Australo-Papuan honeyeaters (Passeriformes, Meliphagidae) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 31 943‚Äì960 It was placed in the genus Gliciphila by Gregory Mathews in 1912, and this name was used in its current binomial name.

Proceedings Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 101 11040-11045 Distribution The tawny-crowned honeyeater is found from the North Coast of New South Wales through to the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, as well as in Victoria and Tasmania. It also occurs in southwest Western Australia from Israelite Bay westwards. Its natural habitat is low shrubland and heath. Breeding The breeding season may take place from June to December. The bulky cup-shaped nest is made of bark, grass, and even seaweed, and lined with softer material such as fur or wool. It is hidden among shrubby vegetation. The clutch size is usually two or three, and occasionally four. Measuring 21 x 14 mm, the oval eggs are beige, with buff or pink-tinged splotches.

A member of the genus Phylidonyris, it is most closely related to the common New Holland honeyeater (P. novaehollandiae) and the white-cheeked honeyeater (P. niger). Two subspecies are recognized, with P. p. halmaturinus restricted in range to Kangaroo Island and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. It has dark grey plumage and paler underparts, highlighted by yellow wing-patches and a broad, black crescent, outlined in white, down the sides of its breast. The species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism, with the female being duller in colour than the male. Juvenile birds are similar to the female, though the yellow wing-patches of male nestlings can be easily distinguished. The male has a complex and variable song, which is heard throughout the year. It sings from an exposed perch, and during the breeding season performs song flights. The crescent honeyeater is found in areas of dense vegetation including sclerophyll forest and alpine habitats, as well as heathland, and parks and gardens, where its diet is made up of nectar and invertebrates. It forms long- term pairs, and often stays committed to one breeding site for several years. The female builds the nest and does most of the caring for the two to three young, which become independent within 40 days of laying its egg. The parent birds use a range of anti-predator strategies, but nestlings can be taken by snakes, kookaburras, currawongs, or cats. While the crescent honeyeater faces a number of threats, its population numbers and distribution are sufficient for it to be listed as of Least Concern for conservation. Taxonomy The crescent honeyeater was originally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Certhia pyrrhoptera, because of an assumed relationship with the treecreepers Certhia. It was later named Certhia australasiana by George Shaw in 1812, Melithreptus melanoleucus by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817, and Meliphaga inornata by John Gould in 1838. The generic term comes from the French phylidonyre, which combines the names for a honeyeater and a sunbird (previously thought to belong to the same family). The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek stems pyrrhos meaning 'fire' and pteron meaning 'wing', in reference to the yellow wing patches. Some guidebooks have the binomial name written as Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera; however, a review in 2001 ruled that the genus name was masculine, hence pyrrhopterus is the correct specific name. Two subspecies are recognised: the nominate form P. p. pyrrhopterus over most of its range; and P. p. halmaturinus, which is restricted to Kangaroo Island and the Mount Lofty Ranges. A 2004 molecular study showed its close relatives to be the New Holland honeyeater and the white-cheeked honeyeater, the three forming the now small genus Phylidonyris. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the white- streaked honeyeater to also lie within the clade. The ancestor of the crescent honeyeater diverged from the lineage giving rise to the white-streaked, New Holland and white-cheeked honeyeaters around 7.5 million years ago. DNA analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Other common names for the crescent honeyeater include chinawing, Egypt and horseshoe honeyeater.Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. Gould called it the Tasmanian honeyeater. Description Appearance The crescent honeyeater measures in length with a wingspan of , and it weighs about . It is sexually dimorphic with the female a paler version of the male. The male is dark grey with clear yellow wing-patches, a broad, black crescent, outlined in white, down the sides of its breast, and a white streak above his eye. The top of the tail is black with yellow edges to the feathers forming distinctive yellow panels on the sides of the tail. White tips on the undertail are usually only visible in flight. The underparts are pale brownish-grey fading to white. The female is duller, olive-brown with faded yellow wing-patches with similar, though less clear, crescentic markings. Both sexes have dark grey legs and feet, deep ruby eyes and a long, downcurved black bill. The gape is also black. Young birds are similar to the adults, though not as strongly marked, and have dark grey bills, duller brown eyes, and yellow gapes. Male nestlings can be distinguished by their more extensive yellow wing-patches from seven days old. Moulting patterns of the species are poorly known; crescent honeyeaters appear to replace their primary flight feathers between October and January. While both subspecies have the same general appearance, the female of halmaturinus has paler plumage than the nominate race, and both male and female have a smaller wing and tail and longer bill. The halmaturinus population on Kangaroo Island has a significantly shorter wing and longer bill than the Mount Lofty population, although this size variation of an insular form is at odds with Allen's and Bergmann's rules. Vocalisation The crescent honeyeater has a range of musical calls and songs. One study recorded chatter alarm calls similar to the New Holland honeyeater, a number of harsh monosyllabic or tri- syllabic contact calls, and complex and diverse songs. The most common contact call is a loud, carrying \\"e-gypt\\", while the alarm call is a sharp and rapid \\"chip-chip-chip\\". The male also has a melodic song which is heard throughout the year, at any time of the day. The structure of the song is complex and diverse, and includes both a descending whistle and a musical two-note call. The male's song is performed from an exposed perch or within the tree canopy, and it engages in mating displays (song flights) during the breeding season. When the female is on the nest and the male nearby, they utter low soft notes identified as \\"whisper song\\". Distribution and habitat Correa shrub There are records of scattered populations of the crescent honeyeater on the Central Tablelands, the Mid North Coast, and in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, and it is widespread in the areas of New South Wales south of Dharug National Park and east of Bathurst. In Victoria it is widespread across an area from the NSW border south west to Wallan with scattered populations recorded further west. It is widespread in Tasmania, except in the northeastern part of the state where it is more sparsely distributed. It is restricted to sclerophyll forest in eastern South Australia, where isolated populations have been recorded in the Mount Lofty Ranges and on Kangaroo Island. Local influxes have occurred outside its normal range in response to changes in habitat. Recorded population densities range from near Orbost, to in Boola Boola State Forest, also in Victoria. While the crescent honeyeater occupies a wide variety of habitats including coastal heath, rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest, mountain forest, alpine woodland, damp gullies and thick tea-tree scrub, they all demonstrate its preference for dense vegetation. It has been frequently recorded in wet sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts and with a thick mid-story and understory of shrubs such as blackwood, silver wattle, Cassinia, Prostanthera, and Correa. At higher altitudes it occurs in alpine heathlands and in woodlands of stunted eucalypt or conifers. The movements of the crescent honeyeater within its range are incompletely known. There is widespread evidence of seasonal migration to lower altitudes in cooler months, yet a proportion of the population remains sedentary. Autumn and winter migration to the lowland coastal areas is seen in southern Tasmania, where it is not unusual to see it in urban parks and gardens, as well as in Gippsland, and the New South Wales Central and South Coast. In the Sydney region, some birds appear to move down from the Blue Mountains to Sydney for the cooler months, yet others remain in either location for the whole year. It is only seen in alpine and subalpine areas of the Snowy Mountains in warmer snow-free months (mainly October to April). Other populations of crescent honeyeaters follow a more nomadic pattern of following food sources; this has been recorded in the Blue Mountains and parts of Victoria. Behaviour Juvenile male in Tasmania, Australia Female feeding on nectar Breeding Crescent honeyeaters occupy territories during the breeding season of July to March, with pairs often staying on in the territory at the end of the season and committing to one breeding site for several years. Banding studies have recaptured birds within metres of the nest in which they were raised, and one female was re-trapped at the banding place almost ten years later. The pairs nest solitarily, or in loose colonies with nests around apart. The male defends the territory, which is used both for foraging and breeding, though during the breeding season he is more active in protecting the area, and therefore much more vocal. During courtship the male performs song flights, soaring with quivering wings and continuously calling with a high piping note. The female builds the nest close to the boundary of the territory, usually near water, low in the shrubs. It is a deep, cup- shaped, bulky nest of cobweb, bark, grass, twigs, roots and other plant materials, lined with grass, down, moss, and fur. The long strips of bark from stringybark or messmate trees are often used. The clutch size is 2 or 3, occasionally 4. Measuring by , the eggs are pale pink, sometimes buff-tinged, with lavender and chestnut splotches. The base colour is darker at the larger end. The female incubates and broods the eggs, but both sexes feed the nestlings and remove faecal sacs, although the female does the majority of caring for the young. The young birds are fed insects, with flies making up much of the regurgitated material, according to one study. The incubation period is 13 days, followed by a fledging period of 13 days. The parent birds feed the fledglings for around two weeks after they leave the nest, but the young do not remain long in the parents' territory. The young are independent within 40 days of egg-laying. Parent birds have been observed using a range of anti-predator strategies: the female staying on the nest until almost touched; one or other of the pair performing distraction displays, fluttering wings and moving across the ground; the female flying rapidly at the intruder; and both birds giving harsh scolding calls when a kookaburra, tiger snake or currawong approached. The nests of the crescent honeyeater are usually low in the shrubs, which makes them and their young vulnerable to predation by snakes and other birds; however, domestic and feral cats are the most likely predators to hunt this species. Crescent honeyeaters pair in long-term relationships that often last for the whole year; however, while they are socially monogamous, they appear to be sexually promiscuous. One study found that only 42% of the nestlings were sired by the male partner at the nest, despite paternity guards such as pairing and territorial defence. The crescent honeyeaters observed exhibited a number of characteristics consistent with genetic promiscuity: sexual dimorphism, with sex-specific plumages identifiable at nestling stage; reduced male contribution to feeding and caring for the young; vigorous defence of the territory by the male; and frequent intrusions into other territories by females which were tolerated by the males holding those territories. Feeding The crescent honeyeater is arboreal, foraging mainly among the foliage and flowers in the understory and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects. It has been recorded eating the honeydew of psyllids, soft scale and felt scale insects. It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects. While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources. A study in forest near Hobart in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, while nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed included moths and flies. Tree-trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) during the breeding season in spring. The flowering of royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters. It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and, when feeding on flame heath (Astroloma conostephioides), it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute. Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species, waratah (Telopea), plate 3. tubular flowered genera including Astroloma, Epacris and Correa, mistletoes of the genus Amyema, and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. In Bondi State Forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung (Persoonia confertiflora), native holly (Lomatia ilicifolia), tall shaggy-pea (Oxylobium arborescens), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa). Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at Adenanthos flowers than those in the nearby Fleurieu Peninsula, while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall. Conservation status While the population numbers and distribution are sufficient for the crescent honeyeater to be listed as of Least Concern for conservation, numbers have fluctuated significantly over the past twenty-five years and currently seem to be in decline. The threats to the crescent honeyeater include habitat destruction, as the alpine forests in which it breeds are being reduced by weed infestations, severe bushfires, drought and land-clearing. The crescent honeyeater's dependence on long-term partnerships and breeding territories means that breeding success is threatened by the death of one partner or the destruction of habitual territory. The influx of birds to urban areas also places them at increased risk of accidents and predation. Cats have been recorded preying on crescent honeyeaters, and at least one guide urges cat owners to keep their cats in enclosures when outside the house or to provide a stimulating indoor environment for them.

Biography He was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1907, and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. On October 12, 1929, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve after graduating from Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas. Gerhart's first tour of duty was at Mitchel Field, New York. This was followed by various assignments, including several years as a flight test pilot in both powered aircraft and gliders. He graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School in April 1941. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, General Gerhart joined the newly formed Eighth Air Force. In July 1942 he went to England with the first contingent of the Eighth Air Force. In June 1943 he assumed command of the 95th Bomb Group, Eighth Air Force, and later became commander of the 93rd Combat Bomb Wing which comprised four groups of B-17 Flying Fortresses. In early 1946, Gerhart returned to London and Paris for a year as air adviser to the American Delegation participating along with the major allies in drafting the Balkan and Italian peace treaties. On return to Washington in January 1947, he served successively as director of the Legislative and Liaison Division, chief of statistical services in the Office of the Comptroller, and as chief of staff of Joint Task Force Three which conducted the first thermonuclear tests at Eniwetok Atoll in the spring of 1951. During the period of his duty with the Air Force Comptroller, he also graduated from the Harvard Business School (AMP-13). Gerhart was appointed as Joint Chiefs of Staff adviser to the Planning Board of the National Security Council in March 1953, and after two years in that capacity, was designated chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group to the United Kingdom. One year later, Gerhart became the commander of the United States Twelfth Air Force in Germany. He returned to the United States in July 1957 to become the first deputy chief of staff, plans and programs, in Air Force Headquarters ‚Äì the job he held until appointed by President John F. Kennedy to be commander-in-chief of the North American Air Defense Command, August 1, 1962. He retired from the Air Force on March 1, 1965, and died January 9, 1981.

Since 1970, participants had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas. From its inception to the 2013 tournament, players from 19 countries ‚Äî USA (10), France (4), UK (3), Denmark (3), Canada (2), Norway (2), Portugal (2), Italy (2), Afghanistan, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Tunisia, Switzerland, Australia, Italy and Finland ‚Äî have won bracelets. History In 2004, Harrah's Casinos purchased the rights to the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area‚ÄîPlayboy, Empire Casino, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a \\"style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe.\\" The WSOPE was entering a crowded field as many major poker tournaments were already established in Europe. Pollack, however, believed that brand recognition of the WSOP and that the \\"WSOP bracelet is the most recognized poker hardware globally will allow the WSOPE to quickly catch up.\\"World Series of Poker (WSOP) Comes to Europe This Fall February 27, 2007. Pokerpages.com. Accessed 7/25/07 Highlights 2007 World Series of Poker Europe In marketing the WSOPE, Harrah's Casino did not rely upon the reputation of Harrah's or the WSOP alone. On July 5, 2007, Harrah's announced its alliance with England-based Betfair, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. The agreement builds on Betfair's European reputation in advertising the WSOPE while creating the largest agreement between a web- based and brick-and-mortar casinos. Due to changes in U.S. laws, effective in 2007, the WSOP could no longer accept money from online gambling companies. This prevented the WSOP from acknowledging WSOP qualifiers from online events. The WSOPE is not bound by this limitation. The United Kingdom Gambling Act of 2005 allows for legal regulated online poker sites. Furthermore, as the laws that govern the age of gambling differ in England than the U.S., the WSOPE admits younger players. In 2007, four of the five finalists at the first event of the WSOPE had won bracelets. Thomas Bihl, however, outlasted each of them to claim the first-ever WSOPE bracelet. No previous bracelet winners played at the second final table; Dario Alioto won the bracelet. Annette \\"Annette_15\\" Obrestad, became the youngest player to win a WSOP bracelet event at age 18 years, 364 days in the final event of the tournament. 2008 World Series of Poker Europe In 2008, the WSOPE added a fourth event and was held at the Empire Casino in Leicester Square, London. The 2008 WSOPE was particularly notable, as Jesper Hougaard became the first person to win a bracelet at both the WSOP and WSOPE, let alone winning both in a single year. The WSOPE Main Event included several big name stars including Ivan Demidov, John Juanda and Daniel Negreanu. Demidov's appearance at the WSOPE final table was of particular interest. While sitting at the WSOPE Main event final table, he was one of the November Nine players scheduled to play in November for the WSOP Main Event. This meant that for a period of time there was a chance that the same person could win both Main Events. As it was, he was the first player to make it to the final table at both the WSOP and WSOPE Main Events. Three-time bracelet winner John Juanda won his fourth bracelet in the WSOPE Main Event. Theo J√∏rgensen, who made it to the 2007 WSOPE Main Event final table, won his first bracelet in the ¬£5,000 Pot-Limit Omaha event. Sherkhan Farnood, undoubtedly had the most challenging final table as four of his final six opponents (Ivo Donev, Howard Lederer, Phil Ivey, and Jeff Lisandro) had a combined 9 WSOP bracelets between them. The 2008 WSOPE also marked a technological advance with the advent of the mobile hole card camera. At previous tournaments, the viewing audience could only see the hole cards at select tables. In 2008, a special camera was used that enabled roaming camera crews to capture the action at adjacent tables. 2009 World Series of Poker Europe The 2009 WSOPE was held from September 17 to October 1 at the Empire Casino in London, England. It consisted of four bracelet events including a ¬£1,000 No-Limit Hold'em, a ¬£2,500 Pot Limit Hold'em/Pot-Limit Omaha, a ¬£5,000 Pot Limit Omaha, and a ¬£10,000 World Championship No-Limit Hold'em Main Event. 2010 World Series of Poker Europe The 2010 World Series of Poker Europe was held from September 14 to September 28 at the Empire Casino in London, England. There were five bracelet events, culminating in the ¬£10,350 WSOPE Championship No Limit Hold'em event which was won by James Bord, the first WSOPE bracelet winner from the UK. 2011 World Series of Poker Europe The 2011 WSOPE Event was held at the Majestic Barri√®re Cannes and the Le Croisette Casino Barri√®re in Cannes. There were seven bracelet events. 2012 World Series of Poker Europe The 2012 WSOPE Event returned to Cannes - again with seven bracelet events. 2013 World Series of Poker Europe For 2013 the tournament moved to the Casino Barriere in Enghien-les-Bains, France. From October 11 to October 23 there were eight bracelet events. 2014 World Series of Poker Europe In November 2013 it was announced that the WSOP Europe and WSOP Asia Pacific will begin rotating annually beginning in 2014, with WSOP APAC being held in even-numbered years and WSOPE in odd-numbered years. Therefore, the WSOP Europe was not held in 2014 or 2016. 2015 World Series of Poker Europe For 2015 the tournament moved to Spielbank Berlin in Berlin, Germany. From October 8 to October 24 there are ten bracelet events. 2017 World Series of Poker Europe The 2017 WSOPE took place from October 19-November 10 in at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. There were 11 bracelet events, including the ‚Ç¨111,111 High Roller for One Drop, the largest buy-in in WSOPE history. The ‚Ç¨10,350 No Limit Hold'em Main Event attracted 529 entries and was won by Spanish qualifier Marti Roca de Torres.  2018 World Series of Poker Europe The 2018 WSOPE is scheduled from October 9, 2018 through November 2, 2018 at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic.http://www.wsop.com/2018/wsope/ There are 10 bracelet events, including a ‚Ç¨5 million guarantee for the ‚Ç¨10,350 No Limit Hold'em Main Event.  2019 World Series of Poker Europe  The 2019 WSOPE took place from October 13, 2019 through November 4, 2019 at King's Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic.

Manske was the last college player to play without a football helmet. Manske played in two NFL championship games with the Chicago Bears, including the historic 1940 NFL Championship Game, a 73‚Äì0 victory over the Washington Redskins. Early life and college career Manske was born in 1912 in Nekoosa, Wisconsin. He graduated from Alexander High School (renamed Nekoosa High School). A member of the College Football Hall of Fame, Manske excelled in college at both football and basketball. A three-year letterman at Northwestern, he began his football career as a walk-on, became a starter during his sophomore season after excelling as a substitute end in a 1930 game against Notre Dame, and ended his career as team Most Valuable Player in 1933. Manske was elected to the All-Big Ten Conference and United Press International All-America teams in 1933. He was also named to the All-Big Ten team in basketball in 1933. In his senior year, Manske played all sixty minutes against Ohio State, Notre Dame, Minnesota, and Illinois, and all but two minutes against Michigan.http://nusports.cstv.com/genrel/manske_edgarj00.html NFL career As part of the first College All-Star team to line up against the current NFL champions, Manske caught the eye of Chicago Bears coach George Halas during the surprising 1934 All-Star game; Manske performed well against starting Bears lineman George Musso. Halas eventually obtained Manske's services by trade with Philadelphia in 1937.\\"Bears Sign Manske to Fill Hewitt's Post\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, 7/27/37, pg. 17 Manske image from matchbook cover, Philadelphia 1937 During his professional football career, Manske played at the end position.

As a member of the Chicago Bears, Manske played his last professional game in the memorable 73‚Äì0 playoff win over Washington. Manske was involved in a trade considered among the most lopsided in NFL history.Bouchette, Ed. \\"The Pittsburgh Steelers\\" St Thomas Griffin, 1994 In 1938, he was traded from Chicago to the Pittsburgh Pirates for the Pirates' first-round selection (#2 overall) in the upcoming 1939 NFL draft.

Military career One of 995 NFL playershttp://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/war/worldwar2/honor_roll.jsp who served during World War II, Manske joined the Navy as a lieutenant commander. During officer training at the St. Mary's Preflight School in 1942, he also played on the team and earned All-Service All-America honors. Coaching and teaching career Manske began his coaching career at the College of the Holy Cross in 1941. After the war, he returned to coach at Boston University and the University of Maryland, then worked as an assistant coach for the University of California, Berkeley under Pappy Waldorf from 1947 to 1952, facing his former Northwestern team in the 1949 Rose Bowl.\\"EDGAR MANSKE, 89 ; Played for NU, Bears; college hall of famer\\", obit., Chicago Tribune, 2/7/2002, pg.8 Manske eventually became an educator, and taught biology at Berkeley High School from 1955 until his retirement in 1975.

Some believe this diversity directly relates to the overall health and vitality of the organism ‚Äî human or animal. Nutritional Diversity or Nutritional Biodiversity, is a diet studied in Panama by an athlete and permaculturist named Brandon Eisler. He has been studying and testing diverse nutritional intake in the range of 50 to 200 different species, not mono-culture derived, and the effects of this on both athletic performance and healing the sick. Although traditional diets emphasize a sufficient intake of fruit and vegetables, they do not emphasize the range or variety of this intake. Nutritional biodiversity encourages the consumption of about 10 ‚Äì 15 different green vegetables over a period of a fortnight, rather than the same green vegetable every day for that same period. This extends to all types of fruits and vegetables. Different fruits and vegetables provide different vitamins and minerals and in differing quantities, and it is this diversity that is essential to ensure that all nutritional needs are met. Every other species of mammal, in the wild, takes in a much larger spectrum of nutrition that humans. The diet realizes also that domestication of food species and humans, is the root of many health problems. In the book Back from the Brink, an example is used of the various bloodlines of race horses in the UK and USA. What the author found is that when horses grazed in fields that did not have weeds and had other non-grassy plants removed (hence a lower level of biodiversity), these bloodlines appeared to under-perform when compared to those that had been allowed to graze from fields in which other plants and weeds were allowed to grow freely.

These groups are a distinctive banking distribution channel used primarily to deliver microcredit to poor people. Solidarity lending lowers the costs to a financial institution related to assessing, managing and collecting loans, and can eliminate the need for collateral. Since there is a fixed cost associated with each loan delivered, a bank that bundles individual loans together and permits a group to manage individual relationships can realize substantial savings in administrative and management costs. In many developing countries the legal system offers little, if any support for the property rights of poor people. Laws related to secured transactions ‚Äì a cornerstone of Western banking ‚Äì may also be absent or unenforced. Instead, solidarity lending levers various types of social capital like peer pressure, mutual support and a healthy culture of repayment. These characteristics make solidarity lending more useful in rural villages than in urban centres where mobility is greater and social capital is weaker. Efforts to replicate solidarity lending in developed countries have generally not succeeded. For example, the Calmeadow Foundation tested an analogous 'peer lending' model in three locations in Canada: rural Nova Scotia and urban Toronto and Vancouver during the 1990s. It concluded that a variety of factors ‚Äì including difficulties in reaching the target market, the high risk profile of clients, their general distaste for the joint liability requirement, and high overhead costs ‚Äì made solidarity lending unviable without subsidies.Cheryl Frankiewicz. \\"Calmeadow Metrofund: A Canadian Experiment in Sustainable Microfinance\\", Calmeadow Foundation, April 2001. However, debates have continued about whether the required subsidies may be justified as an alternative to other subsidies targeted to the entrepreneurial poor, and VanCity Credit Union, which took over Calmeadow's Vancouver operations, continues to use peer lending. Distinctiveness Tapping social capital to lend money is not new to microfinance. Earlier precedents include the informal practices of ROSCAs and the bonds of association used in credit unions. In India, the practice of self-help group banking is inspired by similar principles. However, solidarity groups are distinctly different from earlier approaches in several important ways. First, solidarity groups are very small, typically involving 5 individuals who are allowed to choose one another but cannot be related. Five is often cited as an ideal size because it is: * small enough to ensure a maximum level of joint responsibility and discourage free riders, and * large enough to prevent the misfortune or incompetence of one person from causing the group to collapse. Much evidence has also shown that social pressure is more effective among women than among men. The vast majority of loans using this methodology are delivered to women. Learning from the failure of the Comilla Model of cooperative credit piloted by Akhtar Hameed Khan in the 1950s and '60s, Grameen Bank and many other microcredit institutions have also taken an assertive approach to targeting poor women and excluding non-poor individuals entirely. Grameen Bank An early pioneer of solidarity lending, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh describes the dynamics of lending through solidarity groups this way: The Grameen approach uses solidarity groups as its primary building block. However, responsibility for delinquent loans is handled by the elected leaders of a larger, village-level group called a 'centre' composed of eight solidarity groups. Because all the members are from the same village and loan payments take place during the centre meeting, the principle of using social capital for leverage is not compromised; the only difference is that all the members of the centre are collectively responsible for unpaid loans.Beatriz Armend√°riz de Aghion & Jonathan Morduch. The Economics of Microfinance, The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2005, p. 100. Many microcredit institutions use solidarity groups essentially as a form of joint liability. That is, they will take any action practical to collect a seriously delinquent loan not just from the individual member, but from any member of the solidarity group with the capability to repay it. But Yunus has always rejected this concept, arguing that whatever moral responsibility may pertain among group members, there is no formal or legal \\"... form of joint liability, i.e. group members are not responsible to pay on behalf of a defaulting member.\\"Muhammad Yunus. Grameen Bank at a Glance, Grameen Bank, Dhaka, September, 2006, p. 2. Application Solidarity lending is widespread in microfinance today, particularly in Asia. In addition to Grameen Bank, major practitioners include SEWA, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Accion International, FINCA, BRAC and SANASA. The Calmeadow Foundation was another important pioneer. The Microbanking Bulletin tracks solidarity lending as a separate microfinance methodology. Of 446 microfinance institutions worldwide that it was tracking at the end of 2005, 39 lent only through this method, while another 205 used a mix of solidarity and individual lending. The average loan balance outstanding at solidarity lenders was $109 (19% of local gross national income), compared to $1,024 (61% of local gross national income) among individual lenders. This shows not only that solidarity lenders are meeting the needs of a significantly poorer market segment, but also that they are doing it in significantly poorer countries.Microbanking Bulletin, Issue #13, Autumn, 2006. In Costa Rica, many companies enable their employees to organize Asociaciones Solidaristas (Solidarism Associations), which enables them to create saving funds, loans, and financial activities (for example managing the company's coffee shop) with financial support from the company. \\"Movimiento Solidarista Costarricense\\" Criticisms Solidarity lending has clearly had a positive impact on many borrowers. Without it, many would not have borrowed at all, or would have been forced to rely on loan sharks. However, it has been the subject of much criticism. A recent survey of the empirical research concludes that the search for alternative approaches must continue, and highlights problems such as \\"borrowers growing frustrated at the cost of attending regular meetings, loan officers refusing to sanction good borrowers who happen to be in 'bad' groups, and constraints imposed by the diverging ambitions of group members.\\"Beatriz Armend√°riz de Aghion & Jonathan Morduch, p. 114. Efforts to ensure that all members of solidarity groups are equally poor may not always improve group performance. Greater socio-economic diversity \\"means that group members' incomes are less likely to vary together, and thus group members' ability to insure each other increases\\".Beatriz Armend√°riz de Aghion & Jonathan Morduch, p. 108. The solidarity lending approach, which excludes less-poor borrowers, was adopted in large part because of a view that the more inclusive cooperative 'bond of association' had failed in Bangladesh (see the Comilla Model). But the founder of Bangladesh's credit cooperatives, Akhter Hameed Khan documented that the Model's practices contravened two fundamental credit union operating principles: independence from government intervention, and local financial self-reliance.Akhter Hameed Khan. The Works of Akhter Hameed Khan, Vol II. Rural Development Approaches and the Comilla Model. Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development, Comilla, 1983, pp. 190-92 The case that the 'inclusive' approach to organizational development used by the Comilla Model accounts for its failure has not been made. While poverty-targeting has had many successes, social solidarity is not solely a tool for the lending institution ‚Äì it can also be used by borrowers. A loan 'strike', if it gains the sympathy of a large number of borrowers, can lead to a rapid and highly unstabilizing escalation in delinquencies. It was this type of circumstance that led in 1998, to the rapid escalation of delinquency at Grameen Bank that resulted in the redesign dubbed 'Grameen II'.Asif Dowla & Dipal Barua. The Poor Always Pay Back: The Grameen II Story Kumarian Press Inc., Bloomfield, Connecticut, 2006, p. xiii The photo above ‚Äì of a group of women seated in rows on the ground before a male NGO-officer who sits in a chair processing their payments ‚Äì encapsulates another common critique. Solidarity groups may be composed entirely of women, but the staff who decide when and if they receive financial services are often dominated by males.

It existed from 1983 to 1984 and was formed shortly after the dissolution of the Rossington-Collins Band. Most of the members carried over from the Rossington-Collins Band, with the exceptions of Dale Krantz and Gary Rossington, who quit after a row with Collins. The Collins Band's name was originally Horsepower, but just prior to the band's release of its debut album it discovered another band was already using that name. The Allen Collins Band released \\"Here, There and Back\\" on MCA in 1983, its only album. Collins was emotionally drained due to the sudden death of his wife, Kathy, and as his behavior became more and more erratic, the band began to disintegrate. Jacksonville guitarist Mike Owings joined The Allen Collins Band in the spring of 1984 and co wrote several unrecorded songs. Vocalist/guitarist Michael Ray Fitzgerald replaced Owings in early 1985, bringing bassist Phil Price aboard also, but the project completely fell apart at this point (Fitzgerald, Price and Dougherty had already formed Mike Angelo and the Idols, with Dougherty on drums). Dougherty later played drums with St. Augustine alt-country band Gunga Din, later renamed Crabgrass. Keyboardist Billy Powell and bassist Leon Wilkeson worked with Christian-rock band Vision for several years before re-joining a re-formed Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987. Guitarist Randall Hall, at Collins' insistence, also joined the reconstituted Skynyrd (Collins was at this point paralyzed from an auto accident). Hall later formed the Randall Hall Band and now performs with World Classic Rockers. Drummer Derek Hess lives in Jacksonville and performs regularly with various local bands.
