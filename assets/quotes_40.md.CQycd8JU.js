It covered the period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016. Their Championship record, of 63 points accrued via 16 wins, 15 draws and 15 losses resulting in a tenth-place finish, was exactly the same as in 2014–15. Tenth was the lowest position the team had occupied all season. The average attendance at league matches, of 17,602, was some 9% higher than in 2014–15. As with all clubs in the top two tiers of English football, Birmingham entered the 2015–16 FA Cup in the third round; they lost in that round at home to Premier League club AFC Bournemouth. In the League Cup, they progressed through two rounds before being eliminated by Aston Villa, also of the Premier League, in the third. Thirty-two players made at least one appearance in first-team competition, of whom six were loan signings and one was registered on a short-term contract; there were eighteen different goalscorers. Team captain Michael Morrison appeared in 49 of the club's 50 fixtures over the season, and played in every minute of the 46 Championship matches. Clayton Donaldson was top goalscorer with 11 goals, all of which were scored in league competition. ==Background and pre-season== After narrowly avoiding relegation to League One in 2014, a poor start to the 2014–15 season with only two wins by mid-October brought manager Lee Clark the sack. Under caretaker management, the team lost 8–0 at home to AFC Bournemouth to drop to 23rd place in the table. Burton Albion manager and former Birmingham player Gary Rowett took over, strengthened the defence by bringing in Charlton Athletic's Michael Morrison, initially on loan, and, with the aid of other loan signings including Italian international forward Diego Fabbrini, led them to a 10th- place finish. First-team players released at the end of the 2014–15 season included Callum Reilly, Nikola Žigić, Matt Green, Olly Lee, Gavin Gunning, youngsters Amari'i Bell and Will Packwood, and long-serving goalkeeper Colin Doyle. First-choice goalkeeper Darren Randolph chose to leave when his contract expired. Free-transfer signings for 2015–16 included winger Jacques Maghoma, previously with Sheffield Wednesday, and two goalkeepers, Adam Legzdins, who started his career with Birmingham but never played for their first team, and former Polish international Tomasz Kuszczak. Undisclosed fees were paid for Groningen's KNVB Cup-winning captain Maikel Kieftenbeld, a Dutch under-21 international defensive midfielder, and Danish forward Nicolai Brock-Madsen; the release clause on Kieftenbeld's contract was widely reported at €250,000, and according to BBC Sport, the fee for Brock-Madsen was \\"believed to be in the region of £500,000, with possible add-ons taking it up to £1m.\\" Birmingham made one loan signing: attacking midfielder Jon Toral joined from Arsenal for the season. Out-of-contract players who signed new contracts included club captain Paul Robinson, experienced defender Jonathan Spector, and youngsters Nick Townsend, Charlee Adams, Koby Arthur and Viv Solomon-Otabor, the club extended the contracts of defenders Jonathan Grounds and Paul Caddis, top scorer Clayton Donaldson, attacking midfielder Andy Shinnie, and wingers David Cotterill and the in-demand Demarai Gray. In connection with the club's 140th anniversary in 2015–16, both home and away kits echoed the past. The home kit reproduced the original shirt from 1875, blue with a white sash, with white shorts and blue socks; supporters could pay for their names to be woven into the sash. The away kit reprised the \\"German flag\\" kit worn very occasionally in the 1970s, with a yellow right side and sleeve, a broad red central panel, and black left side and sleeve, black shorts and yellow socks with black tops. Both shirts carried intertwined club initials instead of the globe and ball badge. The kits, supplied by Carbrini, bore the logo of sponsors EZE Group, an entertainment and leisure company. After a training camp in mainland Europe, Birmingham City's pre-season programme continued with friendly matches away to Nuneaton Town, Kidderminster Harriers, Northampton Town, Shrewsbury Town and Burton Albion. They also faced Benfica B at St George's Park. Their only home friendly was against Leicester City. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center\\" + Pre- season match details - !scope=colDate!!scope=colOpponents !scope=colVenue!!scope=colResult!!scope=colScore F–A!!scope=colScorers !scope=colAttendance!!scope=colRefs - !scope=row14 July 2015 align=leftNuneaton TownA style=background:#cfcW3–0align=leftNovak 25' Shinnie 70' Davis 73' 1,071  - !scope=row18 July 2015 align=leftKidderminster HarriersA style=background:#ffcD1–1align=leftLowry 82' 2,801  - !scope=row21 July 2015 align=leftShrewsbury TownA style=background:#cfcW2–0align=leftThomas 2' Donaldson 15' 1,919  - !scope=row21 July 2015 align=leftNorthampton TownA style=background:#ffcD2–2align=leftGray 3' Novak 76' 1,675  - !scope=row25 July 2015 align=leftBurton AlbionA style=background:#fccL0–2 3,393  - !scope=row27 July 2015 align=leftBenfica BN style=background:#fccL0–1align=left n/a  - !scope=row1 August 2015 align=leftLeicester CityH style=background:#fccL2–3align=leftCotterill 23', Gray 25' 7,026  } ==Football League Championship== August–September Unlike in recent seasons, there were only three debutants in the opening-day fixture, at home to Reading. With all senior players available for selection, the team lined up in manager Gary Rowett's preferred 4–2–3–1 formation with Kuszczak in goal, Caddis and Grounds at full back, Spector and Morrison at centre back, Kieftenbeld alongside Stephen Gleeson in defensive midfield, Gray and Cotterill as wide midfielders, and Toral in support of lone striker Donaldson. Either side of half-time, Birmingham took a two-goal lead via Cotterill's deflected free kick and Toral's header from Donaldson's cross. Kuszczak's fumble led to the visitors making the score 2–1, but well into stoppage time, substitute David Davis's challenge conceded a penalty. Kuszcazk atoned for his earlier error by parrying the kick, and Reading's Simon Cox failed to convert the rebound. Away to Burnley, Birmingham twice took the lead, first when Toral ran on to Donaldson's through ball and finished with a first-time shot from the edge of the penalty area, and then via Caddis's penalty, and Cotterill hit the post with a free kick, but with five minutes left, Matt Taylor's powerful free kick earned the hosts a point. Birmingham's penalty caused controversy: there seemed to be little contact by the defender on Donaldson, whose post- match claim that \\"You get told if you get a slight touch go down\\" prompted accusations of cheating. The visit to Brentford, scheduled for 18 August, was postponed six days before the scheduled date of 18 August because the hosts needed to re-lay the Griffin Park pitch on an emergency basis. Unusually, they agreed to reimburse supporters for non-refundable travel costs already incurred. Against Derby County, Gleeson's deflected shot from distance – his first goal for the club – gave Birmingham the lead, which Toral should have increased, but the visitors equalised after an hour, had striker Chris Martin yellow- carded for simulation when he appeared to have been fouled inside the area, and hit the frame of the goal three times, including an excellent save from Kuszczak to turn Andi Weimann's shot onto the post and catch the rebound. After the game, Rowett made comparisons with some of the richer clubs in the division, claiming that although his \\"team of free transfers and players bought with someone’s pocket money\\" were \\"more than matching teams\\", they were \\"always disappointed coming in we haven't done a little bit more.\\" The second goal of Gleeson's Birmingham career opened the scoring in the club's first League visit to his former club, Milton Keynes Dons: he curled Donaldson's cutback over the goalkeeper into the corner of the net. Later in the game, he was stretchered off with an ankle injury that proved less serious than initially feared. To complete a 2–0 win, substitute Maghoma ran on to Donaldson's through ball and placed it wide of the goalkeeper. DonaldsonBirmingham's leading scorer in 2014–15made up for this season's goal drought with a first-half hat-trick at home to Bristol City. The third goal came from a penalty awarded for a foul on Toral; Bristol City's manager, Steve Cotterill, thought Toral should have been booked for simulation. Regular penalty-taker Caddis allowed Donaldson to take the kick to complete his hat- trick, and a Grounds header completed a 4–2 win. After five league matches with an unchanged starting eleven, Rowett brought in Maghoma for Gray for the visit of Nottingham Forest, who inflicted Birmingham's first defeat of the season and became the first team to prevent them scoring. Forest scored after 54 minutes, after which Gray and league debutants Brock-Madsen and Solomon- Otabor entered the game, but in vain. Rowett was disappointed by the way the team \\"became a little frantic and a little bit too hurried and desperate on the ball and did not show enough quality.\\" Neal Eardley, returning to league football after nearly a year out injured, lasted 44 minutes of the visit to Ipswich Town before dislocating his shoulder. On his first start of the season, Shinnie exploited a defensive error to play Cotterill in for the opening goal, which was equalised ten minutes later via a penalty awarded against Spector, a decision that divided opinion. The flatness of their second consecutive home defeat, 2–0 to bottom-of-the-table Rotherham United, was arguably a reaction to the midweek League Cup defeat at Aston Villa. September ended with the rearranged visit to Brentford; since the original date, the club had sold their 2014–15 top scorer Andre Gray, sacked their manager, and appointed former Birmingham captain Lee Carsley in his place. With Shinnie injured, Rowett brought Davis into a three-man defensive midfield, and unexpectedly gave club captain Robinson his first league start in several months. A 2–0 win via Morrison's header from a corner and Gleeson's long ball that Donaldson chipped over the goalkeeper left Birmingham in fifth place, six points behind leaders Brighton & Hove Albion. October–November Birmingham prolonged Leeds United's run without a home win courtesy of a fine performance by Gray, capped by a powerful shot from inside the penalty area for his first goal of the season, two saves by Kuszczak, and a stoppage-time goal from substitute Maghoma. Their own winning run continued at home to Queens Park Rangers, when they came from behind via Robinson's header from Gray's free kickhis second goal for the club in 127 matchesand a second-half penalty converted by Caddis after Donaldson was fouled, and away to bottom club Bolton Wanderers, when Robinson and Gray repeated their partnership for the only goal of the match after 20 minutes. What the BBC's reporter called \\"some desperate Blues defending\\", aided by the introduction of Spector as a sweeper to protect the back four, helped Birmingham hold their lead and go second in the table. Rowett retained that formation for the visit to Hull City, but the hosts profited from the additional freedom available to their midfield and won 2–0. On the anniversary of Rowett's first match in charge, a goalless draw away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham lost 2–0 at home to the same opponents. He was critical of the team's lack of quality, feeling they \\"needed to be more inventive and show more composure on the ball.\\" Birmingham's first home clean sheet of the season combined with a third consecutive failure to score produced a goalless draw at home to 15th-placed Blackburn Rovers, marred by an injury to Cotterill's knee that kept him out of Championship football until February. A free-flowing performance and five goals away followed against a defensively poor Fulham side. In stoppage time, Solomon-Otabor scored his first senior goal: after a run down the left, \\"a neat turn that left Richard Stearman on his backside was followed by a clinical finish\\". Donaldson returned from making his international debut for Jamaica with a groin injury that was predicted to keep him out for six weeks. Rowett suggested the damage could have been less serious had Donaldson not played the whole match despite being obviously unfit, but Jamaica coach Winfried Schäfer said the player had insisted on continuing. The inexperienced Brock-Madsen led the line at home to Charlton Athletic. Their manager, Karel Fraeye, \\"aware that Birmingham struggle at home when they try to be dominant\\", fielded a well-organised team who scored from what Rowett described as \\"their only real chance on goal in the whole game.\\" A defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion put the hosts top of the table and left Birmingham in sixth place going into December. December–January Rowett's proactive changes at home to Huddersfield Townadopting a 4–3–3 formation and a pressing stylewere countered by the \\"worst start you could ever have\\", as Aston Villa fan and former Birmingham trainee Joe Lolley scored after 33 seconds; for the fourth game running, Birmingham could not do the same, and suffered their third consecutive defeat. With loanee James Vaughan leading the line, Birmingham played out a goalless draw at Middlesbrough in wet and windy conditions; according to the BBC's reporter, Morrison \\"should have won it when he headed wide late on\\". A penalty, awarded in first-half stoppage time for handball when the ball appeared to strike the \\"offender\\" in the face, was converted by substitute Caddis to secure Birmingham's first league win since 7 November. Defensive errors led to a 3–0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday, and the last fixture of 2015, at home to Milton Keynes Dons, saw the return to the starting eleven of Donaldson and a 1–0 win courtesy of Maghoma, who \\"performed not one but two cut-backs, sending six Dons players the wrong way before unleashing a fierce strike into the roof of the net\\", which took Birmingham into the new year ninth in the table. Despite the absence of Grayon the verge of completing a £3.5 million transfer to Premier League club Leicester Cityand a first-half injury to Donaldson, Birmingham secured a 2–1 win at home to Brentford via Kieftenbeld's 89th-minute winner. He won the ball in midfield, played it through to Vaughan, and kept running; when Vaughan shot across goal, Kieftenbeld arrived at the far post just in time to slide the ball home for his first goal for the club. A draw at Nottingham Forest preceded a 3–0 win at third-placed Derby County by a Birmingham side described by the Observer reporter as \\"tight at the back, and clinical in attack\\". Kieftenbeld completed the win by \\"crashing home a brilliant first-time volley from the edge of the area\\", a feat he repeated in the next match, also 3–0, at home to Ipswich Town. The second goal in that match, when \\"Kuszczak launched a free kick down the middle, Clayton Donaldson headed on and before the ball hit the ground Toral fired a dipping volley over the goalkeeper from 25 yards\\", earned its scorer the club's Goal of the Season award. A goalless draw at Bristol City meant Birmingham went through January unbeaten with eleven points from their five matches, which brought the team back into the play-off positions and earned Rowett a nomination for Championship Manager of the Month to add to Kieftenbeld's Player of the Month nomination. They lost out to Hull City's Steve Bruce and Abel Hernández respectively. February–March Donaldson scored his first goal since November in the fifth of thirteen minutes of first-half stoppage time, as a result of injuries to Sheffield Wednesday's Keiren Westwood and Sam Hutchinson, but the arrival of Atdhe Nuhiu as a second-half substitute changed the game and Gary Hooper's two goals in two minutes gave the visitors a win. Rotherham United marked the arrival of Neil Warnock as manager with two sendings-off in a goalless draw at home to Birmingham. A minute's applause in memory of former Birmingham manager Freddie Goodwin, who had led the team to promotion to the First Division in 1971–72 and twice reached the semifinals of the FA Cup, preceded the visit of struggling Bolton Wanderers. Having averted an imminent winding-up order by agreeing a takeover deal, they lost 1–0 at Birmingham to a Donaldson goal set up by Diego Fabbrini, making his first start since signing a permanent contract with the club. February ended with a poor first-half performance that was punished with a 2–0 defeat at Queens Park Rangers. March began with second-placed Hull City's first loss of 2016 as former Birmingham defender Curtis Davies deflected Toral's shot past his own goalkeeper, but defeat at Blackburn Rovers dropped Birmingham to ninth position. A man-of-the-match performance from Davis, recalled to the starting eleven for the visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers, his former club, was spoilt only when Carl Ikeme made a \\"great save\\" to stop his powerful shot giving Birmingham a victory. Davis again nearly won the match at home to Fulham late on with a shot that hit the post, but another draw kept Birmingham in ninth, but now six points off the play-off places albeit with a game in hand. April–May A rearranged schedule because of cup commitments or for television broadcast meant Birmingham had eight fixtures in 28 days in April, including home matches against the top three teams in the division. They began at Charlton Athletic, who were on the verge of relegation. After a delay caused by home fans throwing hundreds of sponge footballs onto the pitch as part of an ongoing protest against the club's ownership, Charlton won via a 94th-minute header from a corner when \\"everyone is back and two or three players were stood watching while their player heads it in.\\" With the loan window about to close, Birmingham signed Northern Ireland international striker Kyle Lafferty. The move was in both parties'interests: Rowett hoped to improve Birmingham's goalscoring and with it their chances of reaching the play-offs, and the player had hardly appeared for Norwich City, his parent club, and needed match fitness ahead of the upcoming European Championships. Lafferty returned from international duty with a groin injury, and it was rumoured that he would miss the rest of the season, but he was fit to start the home match against third-placed Brighton & Hove Albion on 5 April. He opened the scoring after 16 minutes with a tap-in following a goalkeeping error, but Brighton went on to win 2–1. Away to Reading, Donaldson headed home after two minutes for his first goal in six weeks, and Cotterill's free kick was parried into the path of Ryan Shotton to secure the win with his first goal for the club. Donaldson scored again three days later, but as a consolation with Birmingham already 2–0 down at home to Leeds United, the defeat left them nine points outside the play-off places. At home to second- placed Burnley, Rowett thought Birmingham were the better team. They equalised though Maghoma's header after Toral's shot was parried, and Grounds headed against the crossbar, but towards the end of the game Championship Player of the Year-elect Andre Gray was left unmarked and touched home a cross. It proved to be Toral's last appearance. He was sent off for a second yellow card in stoppage time, for a foul on former Birmingham loanee Lloyd Dyer, and then injured a hamstring in training that was to keep him out for the last few weeks of the season. He had scored eight goalssecond behind Donaldson over the seasonand provided three assists. After Donaldson's third and fourth goals since Lafferty's arrival gave Birmingham the lead at home to Preston North End, the visitors scored twice towards the end of the game to ensure that the play-offs were mathematically out of reach. According to Rowett, \\"the last 15 minutes was one of the weakest I've seen in a game\\", and he vowed to \\"make sure that I will not have players in the team who are happy with that kind of performance.\\" Despite Huddersfield Town's statistical dominance, with 65% possession, 18 shots to 5 and 15 corners to 2, Birmingham again \\"squandered an advantage\\" given them by Cotterill's free kick to concede a late equaliser and come close to losing the match. Despite being rescheduled to a Friday night for live television, Birmingham's last home match of the season drew a season- high attendance of 21,380boosted by nearly 5,000 visiting supporters and encouraged by a newly formed \\"singing section\\" in the Tilton Road end of the groundwho saw an exciting 2–2 draw with Middlesbrough. Gleeson's powerful shot from distance opened the scoring after half an hour, but a few minutes later, Legzdinsin the team because Kuszczak had had surgery on his broken nose\\"fumbled the ball as if it was a bar of soap\\" and Jordan Rhodes tapped in. In the second half, Albert Adomah gave the visitors the lead, Davis's well- placed shot from the edge of the penalty areahis first goal of the seasontied the scores, and a minute later, a Middlesbrough \\"winner\\" was disallowed for offside, apparently wrongly. Both goalkeepers made fine saves and both sides had other chances, but the draw was enough to take Middlesbrough top of the table by one point, although Burnley and Brighton both had a game in hand. The season ended at Cardiff City. With Rowett prioritising players who would be at Birmingham in 2016–17, young midfielder Charlee Adams made his first start and the only loanee in the matchday squad was Shotton, who lost his starting place to Robinson. Morrison, making his 400th league appearance, completed the league season ever-present. Cotterill scored first, from distance, and Birmingham seemed comfortable until Anthony Pilkington took advantage of Grounds' failure to clear a cross. Both Fabbrini and Vaughan hit the post, and Craig Noone and Pilkington made goalline clearances from Cotterill's free kick and Vaughan's late header respectively. The match was drawn, and results elsewhere meant Birmingham finished tenth, with 16 wins and 15 draws, just as they had done in 2014–15. They had won just once in the last 12 matches of the campaign, and tenth was the lowest position they had occupied all season.

They were drawn at home to Premier League AFC Bournemouth, who had won 8–0 when the two teams met at St Andrew's in the 2014–15 Championship. The visitors made eleven changes from their previous league match, Birmingham seven. Morrison's header from Cotterill's cross after 40 minutes gave his side the lead, but Grounds conceded a penalty four minutes later from which the visitors equalised. Cotterill and Eardley both went off injured at half-time, giving new signing Shane Lowry an opportunity at centre-back. Birmingham were awarded a penalty after an hour. With regular penalty-taker Caddis rested, Vaughanthe son of a Birmingham fantook the kick and hit it powerfully but too high. Maghoma hit the post when it should have been easier to score, other chances were missed, and with five minutes left, substitute Glenn Murray took advantage of a goalkeeping error to secure a win for Bournemouth. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=text-align:center + FA Cup match details - !scope=colRound !scope=colDate !scope=colOpponents !scope=colVenue !scope=colResult !scope=colScore F–A !scope=colScorers !scope=colAttendance !scope=colRefs - !scope=rowThird round align=left9 January 2016align=leftAFC BournemouthH style=background:#fccL1–2align=leftMorrison 40' 13,140  } ==League Cup== In the first round, Birmingham were drawn away against Bristol Rovers. This was the second consecutive season that their first-round opponents were the team promoted to the Football League via the Conference play-offs. While wary of the dangerswell illustrated at Blyth Spartans in the 2014–15 FA Cupof making too many team changes, Rowett still selected only three players who had started the previous league match. There were debuts for youth team product Adam Legzdins, who rejoined the club in the summer, nine years after his single appearance on the first-team bench, and for Jacques Maghoma, who opened the scoring after Wes Thomas intercepted an attempted back pass. Rovers soon equalised, but Andy Shinnie secured the win with a low shot from . Victory came rather more easily in the second round at home to League One club Gillingham, as two goals from Thomas earned Birmingham a trip to Villa Park in the third round. Because of the history of trouble at recent fixtures against Aston Villa, Birmingham's allocation of tickets was set at 2,800, less than the 10% of capacity required under the rules of the competition, and far fewer than the 6,500 given to another local team, West Bromwich Albion, in the 2014–15 FA Cup. Rowett selected a full-strength team, and Sky Sports reporter suggested that \\"Birmingham look set for a good season in the second tier on this evidence\\", as they were edged out by Villa's half-time additions of Jack Grealish and Jordan Ayew and a Rudy Gestede header. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=text-align:center + League Cup match details - !scope=colRound !scope=colDate!!scope=colOpponents!!scope=colVenue !scope=colResult!!scope=colScore F–A!!scope=colScorers !scope=colAttendance!!scope=colRefs - !scope=rowFirst round style=text-align:left11 August 2015style=text- align:leftBristol RoversA style=background:#cfcW2–1style=text- align:leftMaghoma 57', Shinnie 68' 5,650  - !scope=rowSecond round style=text-align:left25 August 2015style=text-align:leftGillinghamH style=background:#cfcW2–0style=text-align:leftThomas 35', 72' 9,275  - !scope=rowThird round style=text-align:left22 September 2015style=text-align:leftAston VillaA style=background:#fccL0–1 34,442  } ==Transfers== In {  style=text-align:left - !Date !Player !Club !Fee !Ref -  18 May 2015  Alex Jones  (West Bromwich Albion)  Free  style=text-align:center -  26 June 2015  Jacques Maghoma  (Sheffield Wednesday)  Free  style=text-align:center -  27 June 2015  Adam Legzdins  (Leyton Orient)  Free  style=text- align:center -  1 July 2015  Tomasz Kuszczak  (Wolverhampton Wanderers)  Free  style=text-align:center -  27 July 2015  Maikel Kieftenbeld  Groningen  Undisclosed  style=text-align:center -  10 August 2015  Noe Baba  (Fulham)  Free  style=text-align:center -  21 August 2015  Nicolai Brock-Madsen  Randers FC  Undisclosed  style=text-align:center -  9 September 2015  Shane Lowry  (Leyton Orient)  Free  style=text- align:center -  29 September 2015  Emmanuel Mbende  (Borussia Dortmund)  Free  style=text-align:center -  19 January 2016  Luke Maxwell  Kidderminster Harriers  £75,000  style=text-align:center -  27 January 2016  Diego Fabbrini  Watford  £1.5 million  style=text-align:center } : Brackets around club names indicate the player's contract with that club had expired before he joined Birmingham.

This was later realized in his research and his literary work. In 1962-74, he worked first at the Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishing House, then on the radio (in the Spanish and then in the Brazilian section) and finally at the poetry division of Youth magazine. In the 1970s, he spent much time in the northern parts of Russia, studying icons and local crafts. In the 1980s, he translated Central Asian poetry. Also in the 1980s, he wrote the novels The Face-maker and the Muse, Sleeper at Harvest Time, and Stavr and Sarah. Since 1960, Latynin has lived in Moscow. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Russian male poets Category:Moscow State University alumni ","title":"Leonid Latynin"},{"id":"46387407","text":"The 2015 Exeter City Council election took place on 7 May 2015, to elect members of Exeter City Council in Exeter, Devon, England.

It is also known as the Palace of Arts or the Palace of Zinaida Yusupova. The first palace on the site of the present palace was built in the middle of the 18th century, shortly after the founding of St Petersburg, by Prince Troubetzkoy. In the 1780s, his son, rebuilt and enlarged the original wooden structure in stone. At the end of the 18th century, the palace passed to the diplomat Prince Kurakin; it again changed hands during the first quarter of the 19th century, when it was sold to Colonel Fyodor Petrov-Solovovo. The new owner had the palace again rebuilt under the direction of the architect Mikhail Ovsyannikov. He created the neoclassical five columned centrepiece of the principal facade which is the corps de logis of the palace today. The same architect further extended rear the building between 1829 and 1832. In 1835, the building had another new owner, Count Vladislav Branitsky; he employed the Swiss architect Gaspare Fossati to remodel and extend the palace. It was this architect who is responsible for the distinctive facade facing the Nevsky Prospect today. This facade is of nineteen bays, the central five bays are slightly projecting with Doric columns. Additionally, the facade is terminated at each end by slightly recessed bays containing a high segmented portal with a segmented window designed to be a pastiche of a Venetian window. The principal entrance is on the ground floor at the centre of the facade. The palace comprises four floors, the two lowest, secondary floors, are a semi-basement and a mezzanine; both these floors form a rustic base to the two principal floors above. The third floor is a piano nobile and has tall casement windows; the fourth floor only has windows in the five central bays, the flanking seven bay wings at fourth floor level are adorned with heavy armorial bass relief panels. The central columned five bays are surmounted by a pediment, which once displayed the Branitsky arms, the coat of arms was defaced after the Russian Revolution, but the sculpted decoration which supported the arms remains. Branitsky sold the palace to a member of the Kalugin family, who then resold it to Dmitry Bernadaki. Between the beginning of the 20th century and 1917 the palace belonged to Princess Zinaida Yusupova, though she probably never lived there, as she is known to have lived in her larger St Petersburg residence, the Moika Palace. In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the building was nationalized. The building is listed as a cultural monument of federal significance (as either Petrovo-Solovovo House or Zinaida Yusupova House). It is also a part (together with the whole ensemble of Nevsky Prospect) of the World Heritage site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. ==References== Category:Nevsky Prospekt Category:Neoclassical architecture in Russia Category:Palaces in Saint Petersburg ","title":"Nevsky Prospect 86"},{"id":"46387485","text":"The 2015 Fylde Borough Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Fylde Borough Council in England.

Towards the north and east of the Borough of Guildford, a new party the Guildford Greenbelt Group won three seats, two in Send ward and one in Clandon & Horsley ward. All three of these gains were from the Conservatives. Also in the north and east of the Borough of Guildford, the Liberal Democrats retained their 2014 by-election gain, which they had made from the Conservatives, in Lovelace ward. Moving from the east and north east of the borough to the town of Guildford itself, the Conservatives made five gains. They gained one of the three Liberal Democrat seats on Friary & St Nicolas ward, plus one of the three Liberal Democrat seats on Stoughton ward, plus the Liberal Democrat seat on Stoke ward. They also gained two of the three seats on Westborough ward, taking one from the Liberal Democrats and one from Labour.Guildford results Get Surrey, website of the Surrey Advertiser/Herald/Guardian group of newspapers. 8 May 2015. Accessed 22 May 2015. The summary table below shows changes relative to the 2011 Guildford Borough Council election results. It does not take account of the interim by-election change in Lovelace ward. ==Voting trends== This article compares the votes obtained in the 2015 election with those obtained in 2011. The percentages obtained per candidate can be found in the full list of ward by ward results further down this page. The source and methodology for calculating percentages are discussed in the reference notes at the foot of the page. The 2015 Guildford Borough Council election coincided with the United Kingdom general election. This resulted in a significantly increased turnout. The wards to the west of Guildford town saw the Conservatives win every single seat, by a comfortable margin. In five of the six rural wards to the west of Guildford where there was both a Liberal Democrat candidate and a Guildford Greenbelt Group candidate, it was the Greenbelt candidate, rather than the Liberal Democrat, who was the runner up to the Conservatives. The voting behaviour in the town of Guildford itself was different to the rural areas. In a clear majority of the rural wards the top two parties were the Conservatives and the Guildford Greenbelt Group. By contrast in the town of Guildford itself, the Greenbelt Group were not in the top two in any of the wards. The west side of the town had a number of wards where the total number of votes cast for Conservative candidates in that ward and cast for Liberal Democrats in that ward were nearly equal. The closest was in Stoughton which had a total combined vote for Conservative candidates of 4421, versus 4424 for the Liberal Democrats. In Friary & St Nicolas ward, the total combined vote for the three Conservative candidates was 4265. The total combined vote for the three Liberal Democrat candidates was 4254. In the east side of the town, other than Stoke ward, the Conservative won comfortably in all the wards, with the Liberal Democrats a distant second. The Labour percentage vote in the town of Guildford itself, if one considers the wards as a whole, was up. However the Labour vote was down in percentage terms in those wards which had a Labour councillor going into the election. The most dramatic voting change occurred in the eastern rural wards. Traditionally these have contained the Conservative's safest seats. In 2011, the Conservatives won all six of the council seats in Clandon & Horlsey ward, Lovelace ward and Send ward towards the east and north east of the Borough. In 2015, the Conservative only retained two of those six seats; losing three seats to the Guildford Greenbelt Group and seeing the Liberal Democrats retain their 2014 by election gain in Lovelace ward. The long-term future of the Wisley Airfield site, in Lovelace ward, was one of the issues particular to this part of Guildford Borough.For example see http://www2.guildford.gov.uk/publicaccess/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal;=_GUILD_DCAPR_148758 ==Ash== Ash South & Tongham Ash is to the west of Guildford Borough Council and borders Aldershot further to its west. Ash South and Tongham ward is the southerly one of the three Ash wards. It elects three councillors. The 2011 elections had seen three Conservative candidates face only 2 Labour candidates and no one else. As a results the three Conservatives had been returned very easily with each candidate getting around 80% of the vote. The 2015 elections were more competitive. Three Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, one Labour and one Guildford Greenbelt candidate stood for this ward. The three Conservatives won between 63% and 69% of the vote. Two new councillors for the area, Nigel Kearse and Paul Spooner, were amongst those elected. The two Liberal Democrat, one Labour and one Guildford Green Belt candidates each obtained votes in the 20% to 30% region. Ash Vale Ash Vale is the northerly of the three Ash wards. It elects two councillors. The Liberal Democrats had not put up candidates in either the Ash South & Tongham ward or the Ash Vale ward in the 2011 elections. In 2015 two Liberal Democrats and two Conservatives competed in this ward. The Conservatives won. There was a noticeable difference between the vote of the top Conservative candidate (71%) and that of the second candidate (60%). By contrast the two Liberal Democrat candidates, in Ash Vale ward, were only 2 vote apart from one another. Ash Wharf Ash Wharf is the central of the three Ash wards. It elects two candidates. In both the 2011 elections and the 2015 elections, four years later, the top Conservative candidate, in Ash Wharf, obtained 63.3% of the vote. ==West Rural Guildford== Normandy Normandy elects one councillor. It is the ward between Guildford (the town) and Ash. The Conservatives held Normandy ward, in 2015, with a majority of 644 over the second placed Guildford Greenbelt candidate. The Liberal Democrats fell back to fourth, behind the Labour candidate. The Liberal Democrats only obtaining around 7% of the vote in a seat they (and their SDP-Liberal Alliance predecessors) had held between 1987 and 1999. New councillor for the area David Bilbe was elected. Pilgrims Pilgrims ward covers a number of small villages along the North Downs. It elects one councillor. Conservative Tony Rooth was re-elected with 61.9% of the vote, with the Guildford Greenbelt candidate, on 14.6%, in second place. Pirbright Pirbright elects one councillor. The previous three contests in Pirbright have been straight Conservative versus Liberal Democrat fights. This time in addition to Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates, there was a Guildford Greenbelt candidate. The Conservative share of the vote has remained within a fairly consistent range, in Pirbright, over the last decade. It was roughly 66% in 2007, 64% in a by election in 2010 and 71% in 2011. In 2015, it was 66%. Existing councillor, Gordon Jackson, was re-elected. Shalford Shalford borders Guildford town to its south west. It elects two councillors. The ward includes Artington and Compton as well as Shalford. Shalford was one of a number of wards in Guildford where the Conservatives retained the seat in 2015, but with new candidates. Michael Illman and Michael Parsons were elected with a majority that fell slightly from the Conservatives 2011 majority of 746, to 669. The runner up was the Guildford Greenbelt Group. Worplesdon Worplesdon ward borders the town to the north and north west of Guildford. It elects three councillors. It includes a substantial amount of town overspill in addition to villages like Worplesdon and Wood Street village. The Conservatives retained their three seats in Worplesdon ward. Their majority increased slightly from 399, in 2011, to 426 in 2015. Existing councillors for the area David Elms, Bob McShee and Iseult Roche were re-elected. The Guildford Greenbelt Group were the runners up. The Liberal Democrat vote fell to around 15% (in 2011 it had been in the 32-35% range). ==Guildford Town - West Side== Friary & St Nicolas Friary & St Nicolas ward elects three councillors. The Friary bit of this ward covers most of the town centre, stretching slightly to its north. The St Nicolas bit of the ward is on the other side (the west side) of the River Wey and covers the south west part of the town. Prior to the 2015 elections all the councillors, since 1983, for Friary & St Nicolas had been Liberal Democrats (or their predecessors). However the Liberal Democrat majorities had been consistently falling through a number of elections. In 2003 the Liberal Democrat majority had been 1014, in 2007 it was 553, and in 2011 it fell to 241. In 2015, the Conservatives took one of the three Liberal Democrats seats on Friary & St Nicolas ward. Onslow Onslow include Onslow Village, Guildford Park and the University of Surrey. The ward elects three councillors. In the previous eight full council elections in Onslow, half the time three Liberal Democrats had been elected and the other half of the time two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative had been elected. In 2015, the result in Onslow was, once again, two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative. The top Labour, Green and Guildford Greenbelt candidates all obtained between 21% and 23% of the vote The gap between the top Conservative candidate in Onslow and the bottom one was around 14% of the total vote. The gap between the top Greenbelt candidate and the bottom one was between 9 and 10% of the total vote. The gap between the top Labour candidate and the bottom one was between 8 and 9% of the total vote; which tends to indicate that there was a lot of voting splitting between the parties, or plumping for just one candidate. Stoughton Stoughton is to the north west of Guildford. It elects three councillors. Stoughton was one of three wards to the west of Guildford in which a Conservative topped the poll, followed by two Liberal Democrats. The other two wards were Friary & St Nicolas and Onslow wards. The Liberal Democrat in third place beat the Conservative in fourth by six votes. Third gets elected, fourth doesn't. Westborough Westborough ward includes Westborough and Park Barn. Park Barn was largely built as a council estate. Westborough ward elects three councillors. Throughout most of its history, as a council ward, Labour have held all three of the Westborough council seats. Westborough became a ward on Guildford Municipal Borough Council in 1933, as the boundaries of the town were extended to the west around that time, necessitating a new ward in that area. Between 1933 and 2014, the Conservatives won only once in Westborough ward, in 1968,See Twentieth Century Local Election Results vol 5 Guildford Borough Council compiled by Roger Ottewill, published by University of Plymouth a year where Labour did very poorly in local elections throughout England and the Conservative gained a lot of their seats as a result.

It is around 25,000 light years or 7,600 parsec from the Sun. WR 42e is one of the most massive and most luminous stars known. WR 42e was first catalogued in 2004 as a member of NGC 3603, numbered 954. It was noted as having x-ray and Hα emission. A detailed study published in 2012 showed that the faint red star was actually a highly obscured (6.4 magnitudes in the visual) hot blue Wolf Rayet star and gave it the name WR 42e. Subsequent changes to the naming conventions for new galactic Wolf Rayet stars mean it is also called WR 42-1. WR 42e is located 2.7 arcmin west-northwest of the massive open cluster HD 97950 at the heart of NGC 3603, corresponding to 6 parsecs at the distance of NGC 3603. This is outside the compact core of the cluster where similar massive luminous stars are found. It is speculated that WR 42e was ejected in an unusual three-body encounter possibly involving the merger of two of the stars and the ejection of both the resulting objects. The spectrum of WR 42e shows many characteristics of an OIf* star, such as hydrogen Balmer series absorption lines and emission lines of ionised nitrogen and helium. The relative strengths of the nitrogen emission lines and the lack of absorption in the 468.4 m, helium line indicate a spectral class of O3 If*. However, the Hβ line shows a distinct emission wing. A P Cygni profile for this line is a defining character of the OIf*/WN class and so WR 42e is assigned the type O3If*/WN6. ==See also== *Initial mass function ==References== Category:Carina (constellation) Category:Wolf–Rayet stars Category:2MASS objects Category:O-type supergiants Category:NGC 3603 ","title":"WR 42e"},{"id":"46387839","text":"The Tamil genocide resolution of 2015 was passed by the Northern Provincial Council on 10 February 2015 seeking an UN inquiry to investigate the genocide of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka by successive Sri Lankan Governments, and direct appropriate measures at the International Criminal Court outlining the Tamil people had no faith in the domestic commission. The resolution which was proposed and tabled by the chief minister of the Northern Province, Justice C. V. Vigneswaran, was enacted with an overwhelming majority in the council. Tabling the motion, Vigneswaran said \\"this historically important resolution\\" will help the Tamils take forward their struggle effectively and internationally. ==Observations== The resolution outlined the need for the OISL investigation to not restrict itself to the time period of 2002 and 2011 but back to the country's history since 1950s when it achieved independence. The resolution claimed that the genocide of Tamils became synonymous with the country's policies since it gained independence, and Tamils across the island, particularly in the North-East have been subject to gross and systematic human rights violations, culminating in the mass atrocities committed in 2009. Sri Lanka’s historic violations include over 60 years of state sponsored anti- Tamil pogroms, massacres, sexual violence, and acts of cultural and linguistic destruction perpetrated by the state. The resolution alleged that these atrocities have been perpetrated with the intent to destroy the Tamil people, and therefore constitute genocide. Events highlighted include the Disenfranchisement of Indian Origin Tamils in 1948 which stripped them of citizenship, the Sinhala Only Act and the ensuing anti-Tamil pogrom in 1956 and 1958, the Tamil Conference incident in 1974, the Burning of Jaffna library by Sinhala politicians in 1981 and the anti-Tamil pogroms in 1977 and 1983 all of which had occurred before the rise of an organized Tamil military struggle. Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1983, there had been at least 50 separate incidents of massacres of Tamil civilians. The UN had put the Tamil civilian death toll in the 27-year war at between 60,000 and 100,000. According to Mannar Bishop, Rayappu Joseph, at the end of the 2006-2009 war, 146,679 Tamils were not accounted for. The UN Panel of Experts had said that former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was involved in the infamous \\"White Van\\" abductions of Tamils. The UN Secretary General’s Panel of Experts had found that there were \\"credible\\" allegations of abduction, rape and sexual violence in the refugee camps against the Security Forces. These genocidal acts \\"have caused serious mental harm to the Tamils,\\" the resolution said. Five years after the end of the war, the military still dominates the North, the resolution claimed. In some areas of the North East, there is 1 soldier for every 3 Tamils. In Tamil-speaking areas, the Sri Lankan military has exponentially increased its role in Tamils’ daily life, expanded the amount of land it controls, and is establishing itself as a permanent, occupying presence. And as a result there have been sporadic increase in Sinhalese settlements in Tamil areas, land grabs, construction of Buddhist temples, and conversion of street and village names to Sinhalese. In the Central Province, forced sterilization had rampantly brought down the population of Indian origin Tamils vis-à-vis other communities. In 2007, the US embassy alleged forced abortions. The extreme level of militarization uniquely affects Tamil women. With heavy military presence, the security of 90,000 female-headed households is in jeopardy. These women are especially vulnerable to sexual violence due to the military’s predatory practices, the resolution mentioned. The members of the Council termed the case of genocide of Tamils unique as it has spanned over several decades and still continuing, and was perpetuated by several successive regimes before intensifying into a no-holds-barred war for nearly three decades and culminating in the mass atrocities of 2009. Hence the Council, stressed the vitality of international intervention both to combat Sri Lanka's institutionalized impunity and also promote human rights and the values of peace, justice and self-determination for Tamils. ==See also== * 2013 Tamil Nadu Assembly Resolution on Sri Lanka * Permanent Peoples' Tribunal * Genocides in history ==References== Category:Resolutions (law) Category:Northern Provincial Council Category:Sri Lankan Civil War Category:2015 in Sri Lanka Category:Sri Lankan Tamil politics Category:2015 documents ","title":"2015 Northern Province Council resolution on genocide of Tamils"},{"id":"46387845","text":"North Long Street–Park Avenue Historic District is a national historic district located at Salisbury, Rowan County, North Carolina.

It was established on February 9, 1938, under the authority of American missionary priest John Angel Romaniello. Like other foreign missionaries, he was expelled from China at the time of the Korean war in the 1950s, however, he retained the legal office of prefect of Guilin in the church until the 1980s. In 1993 a bishop was consecrated for Guilin, Bishop Benedict Cai (Chinese name: Cai Xiufeng 蔡秀峰). The consecration of Bishop Benedict was done without the expressed approval of the Holy See and would therefore be subject to a penalty of automatic excommunication unless done under a perceived threat of force or done with secret permission from the Holy See. Bishop Benedict died on August 20, 2007, at the age of 90, as of 2015 no new bishop has been consecrated yet as his replacement and the tiny catholic community in Guilin has only one priest in one church for the entire region. ==Churches== Guilin only has one catholic church in the entire region. Guilin region within Guangxi has about 4.5 million people, but there are only about 4000 Catholics, most of whom are merely migrants from other places who work in Guilin. This church is located slightly to the east of the intersection of jiefang lu (liberation road) and zhongshan zhonglu (middle mountain centre road) in downtown Guilin. It is located on the north side of jiefang lu (address in Chinese 桂林市解放东路48号天主堂), with a small park filled with palm trees between the street and the church. It has mass in Chinese at 8:00am on Sunday, and 7:30am on weekdays (7:00 in the hot summer). The listed phone number of the church is 0773-2822107. The church was built in the early 2000s, replacing a much older church built in the 1930s that ceased to be used. When the church was built in the 2000s, the city government of Guilin planned to place a new building in between the church and the road, thus almost completely blocking all access and view of the church, however, because of replacement in the staff of the municipal government, this plan did not come to be and the city government instead placed a park instead. The church is dedicated to St Therese de Lisieux.

It is a majority owned subsidiary of ‘Markaz’, an asset management and investment banking institution that is headquartered in Kuwait. Marmore specializes in researches focused on financial markets, economic and sector studies, and policy analyses, with a primary focus on the Middle East and North African region (Mena). Markaz's Assets Under Management (AUM) as of 30 September 2018 is KD 1.06 Billion (US$3.51 Billion). Marmore's business model revolves around both syndicated research as well as customized research. Marmore's syndicated research is sector/industry specific and aids clients with information and analyses in order to facilitate informed strategic decisions. The company also conducts specialized and customized researches for clients who have specific requirements. Marmore's research offerings encompass a spectrum of periodicity, ranging from daily to yearly publications. The company's research capabilities and product lines are represented with the following schema by the firm: Marmore's research offerings contain three broad streams. The following schema illustrates the broad framework of research publications from Marmore. Marmore's published research essentially works under seven research pillars: ==Infrastructure research== Over the past decades, the GCC has remained a highly lucrative market for infrastructure investments and build-up aided by demographic growth as well as oil income. Marmore's infrastructure research attempts to provide intelligence and analysis on various developments in the sector to support investment strategies. The various infrastructure streams covered include power, water, ports, ICT, aviation, roads and railways, and real estate. Marmore’s infrastructure research generally focuses on lighting infrastructure bottlenecks and areas requiring urgent investments in terms of providing a fillip to the host economies. An example is the firm's report on GCC Seaports, in which key areas requiring investments were highlighted. Apart from GCC oriented reports, Marmore provides country specific reports which can be useful for investors looking for research on a particular sector in a country. For e.g., Marmore's report on Kuwait Water helped highlight the fact that the total investment in Kuwait's water sector between 2005 and 2014 stood at $5.28 billion. ==Sector research== Marmore's sector reports focus on strategically important sectors in terms of the Mena region. These reports analyse multiple sectors for a plethora of investment opportunities, market analysis, general economic research and for policy making activities. Marmore’s sector reports cover niche areas that, nevertheless, are of value in terms of strategic investments. Examples of sectors covered include the banking, Retail, wealth management, offsets, etc. Marmore's sector research provides an overview for the busy investor, while those pursuing deeper market information can peruse the reports for deeper insights and extensive analyses. An example of sector research from Marmore is the GCC Banking report. Marmore's GCC Healthcare report sized the growing market and provided a round-up on the key projects across the GCC. ==Economic research== The economic research series from Marmore analyses a number of topical economic themes of the day in terms of the economic currents shaping developments. Marmore's Economic Research encompasses thematic qualitative researches that can encourage informed discussion and further knowledge generation. They usually follow the format of strategic research notes and provide the key breakout thinking on a topic. Topical themes are picked up for discussion and analysis, and for quantification (wherever possible). For e.g., Marmore's 2015 economic research on the roll back of fuel subsidies in Kuwait estimated that the \\"fuel price increases may escalate costs facing the Kuwaiti construction industry by about 1% of GDP,\\" Marmore's report on the fiscal breakeven oil price flagged the large differences in estimation that can stem from whether investment income are included or excluded in calculations . ==Capital market research== Through its capital market reports series, Marmore attempts to provide perspectives to investors and other interested stakeholders regarding Mena capital markets. Marmore's capital market reports are comprehensive in nature in terms of covering the breadth of issues and data that informed investors need in terms of understanding dynamic capital markets of the region. The reports also provide an analysis of historical trends and future projections. Examples include GCC M&A; Report—2014, MENA Asset Management Policy Perspectives, etc. A specific example includes the GCC asset management industry study, which provides a deep dive into the asset management industry across the GCC in terms of assets under management (AUM), number and types of funds managed, top managers across the various markets, fund costs, etc. ==Periodic research== The periodic reports from Marmore cover a range of research requirements, including snapshots of everyday capital market performance to annual publications that summarize the key economic and regulatory trends affecting a country in the Mena region or the region itself, as a whole. In essence, the periodic reports provide regular information on the regional capital markets, economic issues or events shaping developments and the trends that may impact future outlook. Marmore releases periodic publications on a daily, monthly, quarterly and semi-annual basis. The periodic publications cover a range of research requirements. For instance, the daily publications cover everyday developments in the stock markets that are essential knowledge for serious investors (e.g., Daily Morning Brief). On the other end of the scale, the semi-annual publications (like the GCC Market Outlook series) integrate and analyze developments over a time period to synthesize research insights and knowledge. ==References== Category:Market research companies of Kuwait ","title":"Marmore Mena Intelligence"},{"id":"46388060","text":"William Hunter (born ) was a Scottish amateur golfer.

Joseph Dalton Hooker described the species in 1840, from material collected in the Lachlan River, as well as Tasmania. The Tasmanian material resembled the description more closely, and the New South Wales material has been separated as a different species, hence the original Tasmanian material was made the neolectotype. Myriophyllum variifolium is found from southeastern South Australia and western Victoria, and eastern Victoria through New South Wales into southeastern Queensland. It also occurs in central and eastern Tasmania. It grows in shallow still or slowly-moving water deep An aquatic herbaceous plant, M. variifolium grows to about in length, its smooth stems around in diameter. Myriophyllum variifolium intergrades with the very similar M. simulans in western Victoria and South Australia. Molecular work indicated that M. variifolium and related species require further genetic investigation and that as yet undescribed cryptic species are likely; two lineages of M. variifolium were identified and both were paraphyletic to one lineage of M. simulans and an undescribed species. Myriophyllum variifolium can be distinguished from M. simulans by its fruit—the former has yellowish brown cylindrical fruit around 1.5 mm long, while the latter has reddish purple oval fruit around 1 mm long. The leaves of M. variifolium are arranged in whorls of five, while those of M. simulans are arranged in whorls of three or four. A desirable plant in pond or aquarium planting, M. variifolium provides shelter for eggs and juvenile fish (fry). It needs to be planted in at least of water. ==References== variifolium Category:Freshwater plants Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Plants described in 1840 ","title":"Myriophyllum variifolium"},{"id":"46388064","text":"The Happy Lands is a 2012 British film written by Peter Cox and Robert Rae about a coal-mining community in Fife, Scotland, during the long strike of 1926.

The film begins with a miner suffering a back injury at a colliery in the fictional village of Carhill. When confronted about working conditions, the mine owner responds by saying that the workers are locked out until they accept a settlement that involves longer working hours and lower wages. The rest of the film shows the various stages of the eight- month strike by coal miners across Britain, including the general strike launched by the Trade Union Congress in support of the miners. The film makes several references to the First World War, in which many of the striking miners fought and were rewarded for their bravery. ==Cast== * Kevin Clarke as Michael Brogan * Jokie Wallace as Dan Guthrie * Aaron Jones as Wee Baxie * Kevin Adair as Davey King * Farah Ahmed as Mary Miller * Stevie Allan as Pug Henderson * Jez Arrow as Economic League * Michael Barney as Special Constable * Madeline Berry as Granny King * Josh Brown as Pat Brogan * Cllr Willie Clarke as Regional Union Official * Craig Clarke as Andy Jenkins * Kristen Clarke as Billy Jenkins * Patricia Colville as Jenny Saville * Fiona Combe as Lily Wilson * Allan Stewart as Harry Lauder * Megan Taylor as Susie Smith == References  * Official website * UNISON Scotland's webpage on the film * BBC's webpage on the film * The Happy Lands at the Internet Movie Database * Relatives pay tribute to mining heroes of 1926 general strike in new film The Happy Lands * Fife man keen to mine his newly- found acting talent Category:2012 films Category:2010s historical drama films Category:British films Category:British buddy films Category:British historical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Fife Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films shot in Scotland Category:Films shot in Fife Category:Scots-language films Category:Scottish films ","title":"The Happy Lands"},{"id":"46388068","text":"The tailspike protein (P22TSP) of Enterobacteria phage P22 mediates the recognition and adhesion between the bacteriophage and the surface of Salmonella enterica cells. It is anchored within the viral coat and recognizes the O-antigen portion of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the outer-membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It possesses endoglycanase activity, serving to shorten the length of the O-antigen during infection. ==History== The initial interest in tailspike proteins was in the study of the effect the mutations on protein folding. Some mutations affect the folding efficiency of the protein but have no effect on the final native structure. Other mutations have been identified that lead to a temperature sensitive phenotype. Reconstitution experiments have demonstrated that the in vitro folding process closely mirrors the in vivo folding pathway. It has been further been demonstrated that folding yields in vitro decrease strongly with increasing temperature. == Function ==  O-antigen binding  P22TSP recognizes the O-antigen polysaccharide of LPS serotypes A, B, or D1. The serotypes correspond to species S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, and S. Paratyphi A. These carbohydrates share the same main chain trisaccharide repeating unit alpha-D- mannose-(1—4)-alpha-L-rhamnose-(1—3)-alpha-D-galactose-(1—2), but each have a different 2,6-dideoxyhexose substituent at C-3 of the mannose. In vivo, P22TSP binds as a homotrimer and one phage particle can carry up to 6 tailspikes. P22TSP can bind multivalently, leading to an essentially irreversible attachment. It was shown that a minimum of two repeating units or an octasaccharide is required for binding. The TSP is also capable of binding longer fragments with similar affinity.  Endoglycosidase activity  P22TSP has endorhamnosidase activity and cleaves the glycosidic bond of the rhamnose group, producing an octasaccharide product. Two aspartic acids and one glutamic acid in the active site have been strongly linked to enzymatic activity. Different biological functions for this cleavage have been proposed. Cleavage could facilitate access to the membrane. or allow the phage to find the optimal position for infection.  Role in DNA injection  It has been demonstrated that cleavage of the O-antigen is necessary for DNA ejection by the phage. It has been proposed that P22TSP binding positions the phage to inject its DNA. == Structure == P22TSP is a homotrimeric structural protein consisting of 666 amino acids. It is noncovalently bound to the neck of the viral capsid. It has been crystallized in space group P213 and has one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The secondary structure of P22TSP is dominated by a parallel Beta helix comprising 13 complete turns. This structure is further characterized as a beta-solenoid domain. P22TSP is compOsed of two domains, each with distinct function. An N-terminal domains serves to bind to the phage particle and a C-terminal domains that interacts with the Salmonella surface. These two domains are connected by a flexible linker. The binding site of P22TSP is located in the central part of the Beta helix. A deep cleft is formed by a 60-residue insertion on one side along with three smaller 5-25 residue insertions on the other. == Homologous proteins == Several functional homologues of P22TSP has been identified belonging to the bacteriophages HK620 and Sf6. Both of these tailspike proteins also contain right-handed parallel beta-helices and share similar O-antigen binding and cleavage to P22TSP. These proteins share 70% sequence identity in their N-terminal domains, but no sequence similarities have been found in the C-terminal domains. == Translational applications ==  Carbohydrate binding scaffolds  P22TSP has also been studied due to its high kinetic stability. As it exists and functions in the extracellular environment, it must endure harsh conditions such as highly variable temperatures or high concentrations of protein degrading enzymes. The kinetic stability of P22TSP derives from its compact beta-solenoid architecture. It was shown that like other viral fibrous proteins, P22 tailspike protein possesses a high stability against denaturation. This makes P22TSP a promising candidate for use as thermostable scaffold capable of being tailor-made to recognize heteropolymers.  Therapy against Salmonella infection  Tailspike proteins have also shown potential for more translational applications such as fighting bacterial infections. A study has demonstrated that orally administered P22TSP markedly reduced Salmonella colonization in a group of chickens. They suggest that the endorhamnosidase activity of the free tailspike molecule serves to modify O-antigen, compromising the LPS structure and thereby preventing the binding of a phage P22-attached tailspike protein. The authors suggest that this has the potential to be a novel therapy meant to fight bacterial infections. == References == Category:Proteins ","title":"Phage P22 Tailspike Protein"},{"id":"46388081","text":"Rebecca Williams may refer to: *Rebecca Williams (actress) *Rebecca Williams (cricketer), Welsh cricketer in 2011 Indoor Cricket World Cup *Rebecca Williams (sportscaster), see Netball Australia *Becky Williams, labor unionist *Rebecca Yancey Williams, inspiration for The Vanishing Virginian *Rebecca Chase Williams, mayor of Brookhaven, Georgia *Rebekah Williams, Nunavut legislator ","title":"Rebecca Williams"},{"id":"46388084","text":"Boomtown Bossier City (formerly Casino Magic Bossier City) is a hotel and casino located in Bossier City, Louisiana.

The name comes from \\"urna\\" meaning \\"urn\\" and \\"gerere\\" meaning \\"to bear\\" which is believed to be a reference made towards the plant's wide-mouthed capsule. It can be found on gravelly banks or similar habitats and can be identified by the blue tinge to the overall green colour. The stem of this moss is wine red and it has rhizoids that keep the moss anchored to substrates. It is an acrocarpous moss that grows vertically with an archegonium borne at the top of each fertilized female gametophyte shoot which develops an erect sporophyte. == Range and habitat == Pogonatum urnigerum can be found at moderate to high elevations in disturbed areas (near water and roads), sandy soil near water banks, late snow areas, and in narrow fissions of rocks on cliffs. This species of moss is known to live in many locations across Europe and North America such as in: Greenland, Iceland, Canada, and the United States. In Asia, Pogonatum urnigerum has been found in Japan, China, Korea, Mongolia, India, Himalayas, Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. == Description == Cross section of a leaf from Pogonatum urnigerum that shows the lamellae, costa, and lamina.  Gametophyte  The gametophyte is the first and dominant phase of two alternating phases in a bryophyte's life cycle. This part of the life cycle consists of protonema (the preliminary stage where the propagule develops green thread-like filaments), the rhizoids (filaments growing beneath the bryophyte that help anchor the bryophyte to its substratum), the stem, the leaves, its reproductive structure (archegonium in female plants, antheridium in male plants), and the calyptra (a thin tissue that forms from the venter of an archegonium and protects the sporangium as it develops). Pogonatum urnigerum has a wine-red stem. A leaf of P. urnigerium measures 2.5-6mm in length and consists of a unistratose lamina with many lamellae on the upper surface (adaxial side) of the leaf (30-46 lamellae stacked with pillars of 4-7 cells each). Lamellae are vertical stacks of cells that provide many beneficial functions. Lamellae cells increase photosynthetic tissue and the spaces present between the lamellae aid in gas exchange processes and prevent plant desiccation. The marginal cells of the lamellae are relatively the same size as other lamellae cells, thick walled, circular in shape, yellow-green in colour, and are papillose. Each leaf has a wide base that pinches inward and tapers into a narrow lanceolate. The margin of the leaf is not toothed at the base but is toothed from the part of the leaf that is pinched inward to the tip of the leaf.  Sporophyte  Sporangium of Pogonatum urnigerum with its nematodontous teeth. The sporophyte is the second phase in a bryophyte's life cycle. This phase consists of the foot (structure that supplies nutrients from the gametophyte to the developing sporophyte), the seta (the structure that elevates the sporangium), the sporangium (the structure where spores mature), and the operculum (a flap that covers the end of the developing sporangium). In Pogonatum urnigerum, the sporophyte structure takes 6 months to mature during spring and summer. The sporangium fully matures in autumn. The seta measures 1–4 cm in height and is composed of hydroids (water conducting cells), leptoids (conducting cells of sugar and other nutrients), stereids (thick walled cells that provide structural support) and parenchyma cells. Once the seta has elongated, a sporangium develops at the end of the seta. The sporangium has an operculum, epiphragm, columella, sporangial jacket, a spore bearing layer, and nematodontous teeth. Nematodontous teeth are composed of whole, thickened dead cells. Although nematodontous teeth are not hygroscopic, they may aid in spore dispersal through small movements (they do not move much). Before the sporangium has fully matured, it is enclosed within a hairy calyptra (developed from the venter of the archegonium) that falls off after the sporangium has matured. At maturation, the sporangium measures approximately 2-3mm in length, is cylindrically shaped, and light brown to red-brown in colour. After the operculum falls off, the sporangium is ready to reproduce through spore dispersal. Spore dispersal usually occurs in late spring the following year after the sporophyte has fully matured. == Distinguishing characteristics == Pogonatum urnigerum has leaves that grow in more than three rows around its stem which makes the plant appear robust, its leaves and branches do not appear to be flat, it has a midrib, it lacks structures that produce gemmae, its sporangium has thirty-two nematodontous teeth, the bordering cells of the leaves do not differ from the rest of the leaf, white hair points and wrinkles on the ventral side of leaves are absent, numerous lamellae are present on the ventral surface, marginal teeth are present, and the plant may look bluish-green when it is not dry. == Life cycle == Similar to other bryophytes, Pogonatum urnigerum completes its life cycle in two generations which is a cycle called the heteromorphic alternation of generations. It has a dominant gametophyte generation and a shorter sporophyte generation. After being dispersed as a haploid spore, it develops protonema. The first stage of protonema is chloronema which consists of irregular branching, transverse crosswalls, round chloroplasts, and no budding. After further development, the later stage of protonema, caulonema, develops. Caulonema is more regularly branched, has oblique crosswalls, has spindle- shaped chloroplasts and forms buds. Rhizoids also develop to help the gametophyte attach to its substrate. The caulonema buds eventually develop into a full gametophyte which undergoes mitosis to create reproductive sperm or egg (both are haploid, reproductive sperm are housed in an antheridium, an egg is housed in an archegonium). The gametophyte is unisexual and will produce either sperm or egg and not both at the same time. Sperm is transported, often by water, to an archegonium located on the top of a female gametophyte shoot. Once an egg has been fertilized, it develops a diploid sporophyte structure which is composed of a foot, seta, sporangium, and operculum. The foot supplies the developing sporangium with nutrients from the gametophyte. The seta elevates the sporangium. The sporangium develops within a hairy calyptra and produces spores through meiosis. Mature spores are dispersed through the openings of the sporangium's nematodontous teeth either by limited teeth movement or by wind. The small openings between the nematodontous teeth prevent all the spores from being dispersed at once which gives the sporophyte the advantage of dispersing spores over a longer period of time. Life cycle of moss. Through its life cycle, Pogonatum urnigerum alternates between a haploid and diploid life cycle. The haploid structures include: the spores, the protonema, the rhizoids, the leaves, the reproductive structures, the calyptra (developed from an archegonium) and the stem of the gametophyte. Diploid structures include: the foot, the seta, the sporangium, and the operculum. Hairy calpytra of Pogonatum urnigerum. == Reproduction == Pogonatum urnigerum is a dioicous plant that reproduces by spore dispersal. The spores are dispersed over a period of time by the movement of wind or the plant's peristome teeth. Annual growth increments can be found on the stem of this species of moss that resemble the rings of trees. Pogonatum urnigerum does not specialize in asexual reproduction as it lacks gemmae cups and caducous structures that would help itself to asexually reproduce. However, it may asexually reproduce through fragmentation.  Reproductive structures   Antheridium  The antheridium (plural: antheridia) is the reproductive structure found on a male bryophyte shoot. An antheridium has a jacket that protects the sperm while they are developing. Once the sperm has matured, the sperm requires water, such as raindrops, to help carry the sperm from an antheridium to an egg located in an archegonium on a female gametophyte shoot. The perigonium structure is composed of an antheridium, paraphyses (sterile filaments that support the reproductive structure of bryophytes), and perigonial leaves.  Archegonium  On a female bryophyte shoot, the reproductive structure is called the archegonium (plural: archegonia). The structure of an archegonium consists of: a sterile jacket that encloses the egg, a neck, a neck canal that allows the sperm to enter the archegonium to fertilize the egg, a venter that protects the egg and later develops into the calyptra, and the egg itself. When an egg in the archegonium of a female Pogonatum urnigerum shoot is fertilized, it matures and develops the sporophyte structure of the plant which sexually reproduces by producing and dispersing spores. The perichaetium structure is composed by an archegonium, paraphyses and perichaetial leaves. In Pogonatum urnigerum, one seta develops from each perichaetium. The perichaetial leaves also tend to be longer than stem leaves (measuring 5-7mm in length). == Taxonomy ==  Class Polytrichopsida  Mosses belonging to the class of Polytrichopsida are known for several defining characteristics such as stem leaves with unistratose lamina, numerous lamellae, a costa, stereids, guide cells, and hydroids. Polytrichopsida mosses also have a strong conducting strand composed of hydroids (water conduction) and leptoids (conduction of sugar and other nutrients), leaf traces, and stereids. Due to the lack of gemmae producing structures in the majority of mosses that belong to this class, Polytrichopsida mosses reproduce sexually by spore dispersal. However, asexual reproduction by fragmentation is possible. This class is also well known for a hairy calyptra that is present in many Polytrichopsida mosses which functions to protect the developing sporangium. Some species of Polytrichum also have biseriate paraphyses in its perigonium (composed of an antheridium, paraphyses and perigonial leaves) structure.  Genus Pogonatum Pogonatum urnigerum is a species of moss that belongs to the genus of Pogonatum. Pogonatum mosses are known for forming tufts on their substrates. The leaves of Pogonatum mosses are generally erect and are shaped lanceolate from mid-leaf to the tip and have a wider base. Additionally, these bryophytes have a costa and many lamellae on the upper surface of the leaves. The sporangia of mosses belonging to this genus do not have stomata, they have thirty-two peristome teeth that are composed of entire cells and a hairy calyptra. At least thirty-two species belongs to the genus of Pogonatum. Listed below are some of the species that belong to Pogonatum: * Pogonatum aloides (Hedw.) P.Beauv. * Pogonatum belangeri (Müll.Hal.) A.Jaeger * Pogonatum campylocarpum (Müll.Hal.) Mitt. * Pogonatum cirratum (Sw.) Brid. * Pogonatum contortum (Menzies ex Brid.) Lesq. * Pogonatum convolutum (Hedw.)

Mitt. * Pogonatum spinulosum Mitt. * Pogonatum subulatum (Menzies ex Brid.) Brid. * Pogonatum urnigerum (Hedw.) P.Beauv. * Pogonatum usambaricum (Broth.) Paris In a parsimony analysis conducted on the genus of Pogonatum, the species within this genus that are most closely related to Pogonatum urnigerum include: Pogonatum japonicum, Pogonatum dentatum and Pogonatum perichaetiale. Pogonatum urnigerum may likely be confused with Pogonatum dentatum especially when they are sterile or stunted. == Conservation == In British Columbia, Canada, the province's conservation data centre lists Pogonatum urnigerum's conservation status on the BC List as \\"Yellow\\". Yellow status indicates that this species of moss is at a low risk of being lost. At the global status level, Pogonatum urnigerum is listed at a G5 and is considered to be a globally widespread, abundant, and secure species. == Synonyms == Pogonatum urnigerum (Hedw.) P.

Gourlay placed sixth in the 1873 Open Championship and finished tied for eight place in the 1876 Open Championship. ==Early life== Gourlay was born in St Andrews, Scotland, circa 1853. The Gourlay family was well known for their club- and ball-making skills. ==Golf career== The 1873 Open Championship The 1873 Open Championship was the 13th Open Championship, held 4 October at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Gourlay had rounds of 92-96=188 and finished in sixth place. Tom Kidd won the Championship by a stroke from Jamie Anderson. This was the first Open Championship not held at Prestwick. Details of playing conditions In the days before the Championship heavy rains had soaked the course. However, when the first round got underway it was sunny with light winds—ideal conditions except for the wet turf. Under these adverse wet ground conditions Gourlay was still able to post good scores. At the time there wasn't a specific rule in place to take free drops from casual water. The only option, other than playing the ball as it lay, was to drop (or tee up) a ball behind the hazard with a 1-stroke penalty. The winning score of 179 was the highest recorded while the Championship was over 36 holes. This was partly due to the fact that St Andrews was the toughest of the three courses used at that time for the Open and partly due to the difficult conditions. When the Open was next contested at St Andrews in 1876 the winning score was 176. The 1876 Open Championship In the 1876 Open Championship, Gourlay finished tied for eighth place. He carded rounds of 98-89=187 tying with Bob Kirk and George Paxton. ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font- size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1873 !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 !1878 !1879 - align=leftThe Open Championship style=\\"background:yellow;\\"6 DNP DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 DNP DNP T20 } Note: Gourlay played only in The Open Championship.

Fleeing the court, Matilda takes refuge in the mountains, followed by her Minister, Count Magnus. Seeking the throne for himself Magnus proposes marriage and is vehemently rejected by the queen.Bunn, pp. 3–14 Falling in with Podiebrad, a young mountaineer who happens to have an extraordinary likeness to the lost king, Magnus prevails on him to impersonate the missing king. Podiebrad has gallantly saved Matilda's life while hunting, and fallen in love with her without knowing her identity. When he realises that his beloved is the queen he agrees to perpetrate the fraud. He appears as the king, and is joyfully received by the people and by Matilda herself. At first she really believes that he is her husband, but when she realises the deception she goes along with it.Bunn, pp. 15–25 As king, Podiebrad leads his troops to victory and becomes immensely popular with his people. Count Magnus, finding that Podiebrad is not the puppet he planned for, forces an innkeeper, Mathias, to try to shoot the impostor. Mathias fails, and Magnus then seeks to make the deception known in the senate. Podiebrad admits that he is not the real Ladislaus, is nevertheless hailed as king by the senate, and is crowned king by Matilda. Magnus is sentenced to death.Bunn, pp. 26–35 ==Musical numbers== Act I *1. Chorus: \\"May Heaven protect the Queen\\" *2. Song – Mathias: \\"The Prophet his standard was rearing\\" *3.

The Morning Post thought the libretto suffered from having an obscure and unfamiliar subject.\\"Theatres &c;\\", The Morning Post, 29 February 1847, p. 11 John Bull commented, \\"We do not greatly object to mere improbability in the story of a drama especially a musical one; but, though a Drury-Lane grand serious opera is scarcely above the level of [a] melodrama yet neither the one nor the other should contain absurdities palpable to a child of ten years old.\\"\\"Theatres and Music\\", John Bull, 27 February 1847, p. 136 There was criticism that the character of Matilda was morally repugnant for receiving the attentions of Podiebrad while believing her real husband might be alive. The music was no better received. Both The Morning Post and The Era found the overture far too long and poorly constructed. Wallace's music was judged \\"showy but superficial\\", lacking the freshness and novelty of the score of Maritana. The papers thought the ballads for the soprano and tenor to have nothing to do with the drama and everything to do with their sales as sheet music. In 2012 the critic Andrew Lamb wrote that Bunn's libretto has been dismissed as one of the worst ever written. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1847 operas Category:English-language operas Category:Operas by William Vincent Wallace Category:Operas ","title":"Matilda of Hungary"},{"id":"46388238","text":"Charles Whynam Outen (23 May 1880 – 10 November 1964) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1880 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:St Kilda Football Club players Category:Williamstown Football Club players ","title":"Wyn Outen"},{"id":"46388250","text":"Gerald Archibald Balme (27 April 1885 - 17 October 1955) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==Biography== Gerald Archibald Balme was born on 27 April 1885 in St Kilda, Victoria.

He was named as the round 13 nominee for the Rising Star after kicking a career high five goals and recording 13 disposals and 5 marks. 2016 was regarded as Sicily's breakout season.

He impressed in that position, but nonetheless at the end of the season was still the subject of some uncertainty around his position in the team. On August 22, 2017, Sicily signed a three-year contract extension keeping him at the club until 2020. Sicily was suspended for one match in the early stages of the 2018 season for kneeing Geelong captain Joel Selwood. Notwithstanding this, Sicily was widely tipped to be on track for a nomination to the All-Australian team of that year before breaking bones in his wrist in Round 17, only returning during the finals series. Despite this injury, Sicily had a season widely perceived as excellent, and was considered to have to have potential to become one of the league's best defenders. Sicily had another good season in 2019, being selected in the extended All-Australian squad for that year, the only Hawthorn player to do so. He was considered especially important to Hawthorn's defense.

He was introduced by executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins during the show's 30th anniversary celebrations, and was later revealed to be the husband of Kim Fox (Tameka Empson). He made his first appearance on 17 February 2015 during the show's 5015th episode, and returned on two separate occasions on 19 February, one of which was in a flashback episode in which he gives Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) a gun. During these appearances, he is only credited as \\"Vincent\\", concealing his connection to Kim. He returned as a regular character on 21 April 2015. Blackwood praised bosses for the character of Vincent, stating he knew that his portrayal would surprise viewers given his comedy background. He is described on the BBC website as a smooth operator, whose easy charm and quick wittedness covers a steely, ruthless streak and a reputation as a bit of a bad boy. They also state that Vincent believes himself to be the \\"main man\\" in the room, and knows how to play people to his advantage. Despite not appearing until February 2015, the character was foreshadowed by Kim's off-screen marriage during 2014. Blackwood's departure from the series was confirmed on 19 March 2018. He made his last appearance on 20 April 2018. ==Storylines== Vincent arrives in Albert Square having followed Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) home, confronting him and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) about the whereabouts of Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), a former flame. Phil recognises Vincent and warns Billy that he's bad news. Billy reveals to Vincent that Ronnie is in a coma at Walford General Hospital following a car crash on New Year's Day and, upon visiting the hospital, leaves a white rose for Ronnie so she knows he's visited. During the wedding reception of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Denise Fox (Diane Parish) mocks her sister Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) relationship with Vincent, her husband, as she goes into premature labour with his child. Vincent watches from afar as she is taken to hospital, and Kim later explains to Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) that she ran away from Vincent after walking in on him covered in blood and, thus, chose not to tell him she was pregnant. She becomes wary when he tries to contact her again after witnessing her with their daughter, Pearl, and is scared when she finds someone has given Pearl a toy, instantly believing it was Vincent (though it is later revealed to be Denise). Kim tells Denise that Vincent never existed and Pearl was the result of a one-night stand, but later admits the truth and explains her experience when she went to tell him she was pregnant. The following month, Vincent sends Ronnie a \\"get well soon\\" card after hearing she has awoken from her coma, and later visits her. He reminds her of the times they spent with each other when he owned a bar and attempts to romance her, but she quickly informs him that she is married to Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). He leaves, and Ronnie later explains to her sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), that she and Vincent were in a relationship before they left for Ibiza. Vincent visits Kim, who reveals what she saw him getting up to at his flat and he explained that he was helping a victim of a mugging, giving her a news article stating he'd saved the man's life. Whilst in Albert Square, Vincent decides to pay a visit to his foster sister, Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), and reveals to her that he is Pearl's father, leaving her shocked as she did not see Kim as his type. He also confesses to her that he is close with Ronnie. Following their conversation, he decides he wants to repair his marriage with Kim for the sake of their baby, but is thrown when Ronnie requests him to find some way of preventing a drug dealer from testifying against her former grandmother-in-law Dot Branning (June Brown) during her murder trial, which he refuses. However, Ronnie reminds him that she still has the gun he gave her, so he lends her the favour. Ronnie begins to repel Vincent and he begins visiting her more often in hospital, eventually revealing to her that he believes that it was Ronnie's cousin, Phil, who killed Carl White (Daniel Coonan), when it was actually her. When Ronnie finds out he has got the wrong end of the stick, she asks Phil to confront him. Phil approaches Vincent, threatening to kill one of his family members if he doesn't leave Ronnie alone. However, Vincent punches him and warns him to back off. Vincent later visits Kim and pledges he wants to be a father to Pearl, but is interrupted when the police arrest him in connection to the assault of the drug dealer, and later convinces Kim to give him a false alibi for the encounter. Following this, Kim forces Vincent to promise her no more lies, and Donna is disheartened to find they have reunited, bitterly revealing to Kim that Vincent had dated Ronnie. Vincent reunites with Kim having promised her that he and Ronnie are no longer together. He later approaches Phil after finding out he was the cause of his arrest and blackmails him, threatening to reveal Ronnie as Carl's murderer if he does not hand The Albert over to him. Phil's wife Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) disapproves of this, and she and Vincent are forced to share the business. Phil grows irritable about Vincent's involvement in the business and, when Vincent changes the name of The Albert to \\"Pearl's\\", Phil attacks him. Kim decides to end their marriage after seeing him covered in blood, but he soon is able to change her mind. Patrick is initially distrusting of Vincent, but they soon begin to bond slowly, especially after Vincent finds an old record Patrick recorded with his former band. Soon after, Vincent kisses Ronnie, but says it was only to show he still could. After Ronnie and Vincent have sex, Ronnie tells Charlie that their marriage is over. When Charlie fights for custody of their son Matthew, he disappears after being confronted by Ronnie and Vincent. Kim becomes suspicious when Vincent spends long periods of time away from her, and Ronnie unintentionally arouses her suspicions while trying to assure her that she and Vincent are no longer together. Kim confronts Vincent, who later reveals to Kim that he has bought a new house for them and Pearl. Denise and Patrick believe it to be a way of keeping Kim quiet, and force him to leave. Kim misses Vincent, and although they initially agree to give each other some distance and share joint custody of Pearl, they rekindle their marriage and Kim moves in with him. Some time later, Roxy confronts Ronnie over Charlie's disappearance, so Ronnie calls Vincent to get Charlie to call Roxy, revealing that he is alive. Ronnie is arrested for Carl's murder, but it emerges that the men who arrested her are not real police officers. Ronnie discovers that Vincent is working with the police as an informant, and used his contacts to stop her being arrested, and urges her to leave the country before she is arrested. Vincent reveals he is helping the police take down Phil, and Ronnie agrees to say nothing. When Kim finds Vincent has taken delivery of a large amount of drugs, Vincent tells her he is planning to plant them at Phil's house as revenge for Phil's father Eric killing his own father, Henry. Phil has Vincent beaten up by a group of thugs following which Vincent blackmails Ronnie with a recording he took of her confessing to killing Carl to make her go along with the plan, but at the last minute, Ronnie turns on him, destroys the recording, and tells Phil the truth. A feud erupts between Phil and Vincent, culminating in Phil kidnapping Pearl and Vincent threatening to shoot the Mitchells. When Pearl is found at the community centre, Vincent pretends to end the hostilities, but attempts to strangle Phil in his home the following night. He is stopped by his friend Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), so Vincent orders him to leave Walford in response. Ronnie tries to get rid of Vincent by hiring some men lock him in his car boot and have the car crushed, but Vincent is not driving the car so they get the wrong person. Assuming that Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), is in the car, he attempts to rescue her but finds Fatboy's phone and necklace amongst some blood in the boot of the crushed car at the scrapyard. He tells Ronnie the car was empty and Claudette that their feud with the Mitchells killed Fatboy and they should end it now. However, this infuriates Claudette who then compares him to his father and accidentally lets slip that Henry did not die when she said he did. When Ronnie's mother Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) visits, she recognises Claudette and Vincent, and later tells Ronnie that Eric did not kill Henry because he was drunk that night and did not leave the house. Ronnie then blackmails Claudette with the information, so Claudette agrees to end the feud. Vincent is suspicious when Claudette asks for money, and he later sees Claudette with an unconscious Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas). Claudette lies that Gavin was an intruder but after Gavin escapes, Vincent finds an old photograph with Gavin, Henry and Eric, and Vincent works out Gavin was blackmailing her and she killed Henry. She also reveals that she knew Vincent would be killed so sent Fatboy in his car. When she insults Henry, Vincent chokes Claudette, as Patrick arrives and stops him before learning the truth about Henry. As Patrick tries to call the police, Claudette tries to snatch the phone off him, but falls down the basement stairs, hitting her head on a brick. Patrick leaves to get help but when he returns, Vincent has buried Claudette underneath the basement, and tells Patrick to forget it happened or they will both be arrested for murder. However, unknown to Vincent and Patrick, it is revealed Claudette is alive when she arrives in hospital brought in by paramedics after she was found by the side of a road. When Patrick says he cannot cope with covering up Claudette's death, Vincent says he can go to Trinidad until things settle down. When Patrick sees Claudette in the Square, he tells Vincent she is alive. Vincent visits Donna, and she reveals that Claudette is there and has told her that he buried her. Vincent reveals to Donna that Claudette killed Henry. He then tells her that Claudette caused Fatboy's death. Donna tells Vincent and Claudette to leave but Patrick arrives, confirming that Claudette killed Henry. Donna accuses Claudette of only fostering her as a way to ease her guilt, and Vincent tells her to leave or he will tell Gavin where she is. Patrick makes Vincent vow to protect his family and stop being involved in crime. Later, Vincent gives Donna Fatboy's necklace and she says they should stick together as he is the only family she now has. Vincent walks in on Donna asking Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) to father her baby and expresses his concerns. Donna then tells Vincent he is the only man she trusts and that she wants him to father her baby. Initially he is shocked by the idea and says no but after realising he can give Donna the thing she most wants in the world and can make her happy, he agrees, angering Kim. He convinces Kim, and Donna inseminates herself but does not get pregnant and soon after decides she needs to find a committed father. Later, Vincent realises that he misses Claudette and invites her to a family dinner and she promises that she has changed, but when Babe Smith (Annette Badland) is locked in a freezer overnight, Vincent wrongly thinks Claudette is the culprit. A few weeks later, Vincent discovers that Kim has caused him to have a parking fine. He then finds out that Kim never passed her driving test and bans her from driving until she does, deciding to teach her how to drive himself and Kim eventually passes her driving test. Vincent is distraught when he learns that Ronnie has died after drowning on her wedding day to Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and confides in Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) about his feelings of her death. Kim plans a holiday in Spain when Vincent informs her of a friend who owns a villa. Despite initially being reluctant, Denise agrees to accompany them along with Kush, who she is now dating. Kush's mother Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) also gets involved in the holiday. Carmel begins dating Max Branning (Jake Wood), who has recently been released from prison after being wrongly convicted of Lucy Beale’s (Hetti Bywater) murder. Carmel invites Max on the holiday who agrees. But Max is secretly planning revenge on the community and just as they are all about to leave, the police turn up and arrest Vincent after they find cocaine in his car, which Max has seemingly deposited. However, Vincent manages to hush the matter up, but the arrest means that he is unable to go on holiday with Kim. Phil is surprised to find Vincent meeting up with his old friend Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin). Aidan reveals that Vincent is part of a mysterious job that Aidan is leading. Phil joins them, though he is not keen on Vincent's involvement as he is a former police informant. Kim finds out that she is pregnant with her second child. However, when she suffers a miscarriage, Vincent tries to back out of the job but changes his mind when Aidan threatens to harm Pearl. Phil and Vincent are unimpressed to learn that Aidan has also hired Mick and Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). But they are forced to go along with it by Aidan. On the day of the job, Vincent is cornered by Aidan and it is revealed that Aidan was actually seeking revenge on Vincent as his grassing to the police led to Aidan's brother killing himself. Just as about to Aidan is about to kill Vincent, Phil stops him. The men are later horrified to discover that the money they were going to get as a result of the job has gone missing. They dig up a coffin in a graveyard to find the money, but the coffin is empty. Aidan later tells Vincent that he wants money from him, so Vincent chooses to sell The Albert. He comes clean to Kim about Aidan's demands and the fact that they are broke. Kim is horrified to discover that Vincent has missed a mortgage payment and Aidan tells him he wants The Albert sold by the next day. Although Jack shows interest, Vincent is forced to refuse as Jack needs more time to go through with the sale. Fearing that he cannot keep up with Aidan's demands, Vincent leaves a note for Kim and abandons their house. Pearl finds Vincent's note and draws on it; Kim does not see Vincent's message but she displays Pearl's drawing on the fridge. With no buyer forthcoming, Aidan tells Vincent to sell him the Albert for £1; Vincent reluctantly agrees. Vincent tells Kim that the bar is sold, then secretly cuts up his credit cards to stop Kim spending, as she now believes their debt problems are solved. Phil then scares Aidan away from Walford. Kim confronts Vincent over a letter saying they will be evicted due to not paying the mortgage. Vincent plans to sell his car but it is damaged in a hit-and-run; he visits a police officer saying he will exchange information on the heist for money. The officer says there has been no report of a heist but Luke Browning's (Adam Astill) body has been found and tells Vincent to find evidence that Phil was involved. Vincent is unable to do so. He then meets another police officer, who says if Vincent tells the police everything he knows about Aidan, he and his family can go into witness protection. However, he is told he needs to leave immediately, as Aidan has found out Vincent spoke to the police from Phil, who saw them talking. Vincent tries to convince Kim that they can leave immediately but she is against it and convinces him to stay. Vincent enters the car with the police officer to tell him he is not leaving, but the officer is corrupt and an ally of Aidan. The car speeds off as Phil watches on, making a phone call telling them to only scare Vincent. The car comes to a stop and the officer points a gun at Vincent. Vincent accepts what is about to happen but his fate is left unknown. After this, Kim finds the note from Vincent and thinks he has left her. ==Creation and development== Casting and introduction Richard Blackwood's casting was announced on 17 January 2015, where it was revealed that Blackwood would make his debut in the show during a live scene on 17 February 2015. He admitted to being nervous, but welcomed into the show with open arms. \\"I've got to say Jessie [Wallace] and Letitia [Dean] and all the guys, they really made me feel at ease. Adam [Woodyatt] is the nicest guy. He was checking I was alright and all of them made me feel at home.\\" When asked about rehearsing for his live debut, he explained: \\"They are very pedantic here. The opening scene you saw us do, we rehearsed 20 times. They don't play around and you've got to hit your mark. It has got to be spot on.\\" Vincent was described as being \\"connected to everybody\\" on the square. Commenting on his role, Blackwood said: \\"I [want to] thank Dominic [Treadwell-Collins] and Julia [Crampsie] for giving me this amazing opportunity. EastEnders is a show I've grown up watching, so to film on Albert Square is something I'll never get used to! To know my first-ever scene will be a live one hopefully means the team believe in me and I won't let them down!\\" Treadwell-Collins said that Blackwood would bring \\"warmth, humour and energy, which will add so many layers to this 21st century EastEnders villain.\\" The character was described as \\"your best friend, and your worst enemy\\", with Blackwood adding that \\"he has just got layers, villain is just too basic of a word. He is connected to enough people.\\" Blackwood later stated that Vincent isn't a psychopath, but said that he has a \\"dark side\\". He added: \\"If you are in that world, then he will be dark with you, but to anybody else he's cool. He has got a heart but to the villains, he is villainous.\\" Vincent is the son of Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and has many ties to other characters. He was born and brought up in Walford and knew the Mitchell family, including Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). His father was infamous in the area and knew Eric Mitchell and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Vincent had a relationship with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), who he had a lot of history with, said to have happened in 2013. It ended abruptly when Ronnie departed Walford for Ibiza, although they meet once more when Vincent gives Ronnie a gun on Good Friday 2014 (as seen in a flashback episode broadcast on 19 February 2015). Vincent's recent history also included his marriage to established character Kim Fox (Tameka Empson), who had been off-screen during 2014 due to Empson's maternity leave. Kim had been on a cruise holiday, informing her family that she had married while away and returning to Walford alone and pregnant in December 2014. Following Vincent's introduction, it is explained that Kim had abandoned him after seeing him covered in blood. Storyline development On 14 April 2015, it was revealed that EastEnders would be revisiting Vincent's backstory. Following the character's permanent return to the square on 21 April, it transpired that he was the son and foster brother of established characters Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) respectively. Blackwood told Radio Times that the character will get darker as his time on the show progresses. \\"There's a lot more. Wait until you see some of the scenes coming up - they raise the hairs.\\" He began. \\"The writers on EastEnders know what they're doing. They grab you and keep you watching. I've just spoken to them actually and they said, 'we've got a lot more you'. So the audience is in for some trouble!\\" Speaking about the future of Vincent on the show, Blackwood said: \\"The thing about Vincent that I love is that he’s very human. He’s got a dark side, but he only acts that way with people who are in the same realm as him. So if you’re in the underworld, he’s very much like that. But if you’re an innocent person, then he won’t mess with you.\\" Notable relationships Vincent's relationship with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) was originally alluded to during his first screen appearance after he visited her whilst she was in a coma. It later transpired that he was married to established character Kim Fox (Tameka Empson). His relationship with the two characters added to the contrast of his dark and light personality, which was made clear following his original appearances. With Ronnie, he was shown to be more villainous having given her a gun and committed to several dirty deeds prior to meeting Kim; his scenes with Kim showed him to be more caring and laid-back, wanting to be a father figure for their daughter, Pearl.  Departure  It was announced on 19 March 2018 that Blackwood would depart the series in Spring 2018, after three years in the role. Writers pitched a storyline for Vincent which would conclude with his departure, and Blackwood accepted the idea. Blackwood felt it would be the correct time to leave the show, and told entertainment website Digital Spy that he had enjoyed his time on the show and felt \\"truly blessed\\" to have been given his storylines. He added, \\"when I was presented with my last story, I knew it was time for Vincent to depart Walford.\\" A show spokesperson confirmed the news and wished Blackwood well for the future. His last scenes aired on 20 April 2018. ==Reception== Ryan Love from Digital Spy said that Vincent's backstory with Ronnie and Kim has been a \\"fascinating introduction\\", adding that \\"two separate characters are now linked and both under very different circumstances.\\" He went on to say that \\"[the show] clearly has big plans for Vincent, and I for one can't bloody (sic) wait to see what these are after one of the most intriguing, slow-burn entrances in a long time.\\" Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap also commented on the character's name, saying \\"We love how EastEnders' Richard Blackwood still manages to be all brooding and sexy, even though he's been saddled with surely the most unsexy name in soap\\". The following year, Tyler bemoaned a lack of storylines for Vincent. She stated, \\"We love Richard Blackwood in EastEnders, but all Vincent seems to do these days is flap around after Kim. Give him a decent plot of his own, already!\\" Blackwood was nominated for Best Newcomer at the TV Choice Awards and Inside Soap Awards in 2015 for his portrayal of Vincent.Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer In August 2017, Blackwood was longlisted for Funniest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. He did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. ==See also== *List of EastEnders characters (2015) *List of soap opera villains ==References * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Male villains ","title":"Vincent Hubbard"},{"id":"46388382","text":"Ken Phillips (23 September 1943 – 4 June 1995) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1943 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sydney Swans players ","title":"Ken Phillips"},{"id":"46388397","text":"The 2015 Huntingdonshire District Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Huntingdonshire District Council in England.

He is most associated with Royal Wimbledon Golf Club. Lamb finished second in the 1886 Amateur Championship, losing 7 and 6 to Horace Hutchinson in the finals. He placed seventh in the 1876 Open Championship and finished in eight place in the 1873 Open Championship. == Early life == Lamb was born in India on 24 February 1844. His father was posted in India where he worked for the East India Company. == Golf career ==  The 1873 Open Championship  The 1873 Open Championship was the 13th Open Championship, held 4 October at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Tom Kidd won the Championship by a stroke from Jamie Anderson. This was the first Open Championship not held at Prestwick.\\"  Details of playing conditions  In the days before the Championship heavy rains had soaked the course. However, when the first round got underway it was sunny with light winds—ideal conditions except for the wet turf. Under these adverse wet ground conditions Lamb was still able to get around the links in good fashion and played consistently, posting rounds of 96-96=192. At this time in golf history there wasn't a specific rule in place to take free drops from casual water. The only option, other than playing the ball as it laid, was to drop (or tee up) a ball behind the hazard with a 1-stroke penalty. The winning score of 179 was the highest recorded while the Championship was over 36 holes. This was partly due to the fact that St Andrews was the toughest of the three courses used at that time for the Open and partly due to the difficult conditions. When the Open was next contested at St Andrews in 1876 the winning score was 176.  The 1876 Open Championship  In the 1876 Open Championship, held on 30 September at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, Lamb finished in seventh place, carding rounds of 94-92=186.  The 1882 Open Championship  In the 1882 Open Championship, held 30 September at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, Lamb finished in 11th place. == Death and legacy == Lamb died on 1 January 1893 at Matlock, Derbyshire, England. He is best remembered as a frequent competitor in both the Open Championship and the Amateur Championship. In the latter event, he played extremely well finishing in second place in 1886. In the 1870s, Lamb had two top-10 finishes in the Open Championship. Lamb is reputed to be the inventor of the \\"bulger\\" golf club, a wood with a convex face, circa 1885. In his 1890 book Golf, Horace Hutchinson advises that the theory behind the convex face is that shots hit on the heel will have less of a tendency to go to the right and shots struck nearer the toe will have a lesser tendency of traveling to the left of your target. Meanwhile, a shot struck in the sweet spot (center of the clubface) will be unaffected. All woods and metal woods of the modern era incorporate Lamb's invention. == Results in major championships == { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size:95%; border:#aaa solid 1px; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1873 !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 !1878 !1879 !1880 !1881 !1882 !1883 !1884 !1885 !1886 !1887 !1888 !1889 !1890 !1891 - align=\\"left\\"The Open Championship style=\\"background:yellow;\\"8 LA DNP DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"7 LA DNP DNP T11 LA DNP DNP T11 LA DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP DNP WD - align=\\"left\\"The Amateur Championship NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF NYF DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"R16 DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"QF R64 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"R16 } Note: Lamb played only in The Open Championship and The Amateur Championship.

Two elements, the mysterious snake and the village idiot, are Méliès's own creations. Méliès himself plays Rip. His son André appears as a village child carrying a large lantern. (Rip's friends' lanterns are in fact Bastille Day celebratory lanterns with the initials RF, for République française, clearly marked upon them.) Like many of Méliès's films made around 1905, Rip's Dream revels in theatricality. While some of Méliès's earlier major films, such as The Impossible Voyage and The Kingdom of the Fairies, had experimented with innovative cinematic continuity techniques, these later films are based fully upon the storytelling traditions of the stage. According to recollections by André Méliès, the snake was a \\"gadget\\" his father had brought back from England, worked by wires and springs. The snake scene was done on a raked stage to allow the gadget's movements to be seen more clearly. Some of the ghosts in the dream sequence are actors wearing white sheets; others are silhouettes cut out of cardboard. Other effects in the film were created using stage machinery, substitution splices, and dissolves. ==Release and reception== The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 756–775 in its catalogues, where it was described as a grande pièce fantastique en 17 tableaux. For Méliès's more complex films, it was expected that a summary of the action, known as a boniment, would be read aloud during projection to help viewers follow the plot. A boniment published by Méliès in 1905 for Rip's Dream survives in the archives of the Cinémathèque Française. A 1981 Méliès study produced by the Centre national du cinéma highlighted the carefully introduced and constructed dream sequence in the film, and added that Méliès's invention of the village idiot character allows the film to move from reality to dream and back in a fluid and balanced way. Cultural historian Richard Abel called the film a \\"colorful forest fantasy,\\" highlighting its overt theatricality and strong roots to the Planquette operetta. Writer and historian Thomas S. Hischak, reviewing the film's spectacular effects and deviations from Irving's original tale, concluded: \\"As an adaptation the movie is nonsense … but for film historians it is remarkable.\\" ==Notes * Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:French films Category:Works based on Rip Van Winkle Category:Films based on works by Washington Irving Category:French silent short films Category:Silent films in color ","title":"Rip's Dream"},{"id":"46388645","text":"The James H B Carr Stakes is an Australian Turf Club Group 3 Thoroughbred horse race under set weights with penalties conditions for three-year-old fillies, held over a distance of 1400 metres at Randwick Racecourse, Sydney, Australia in April.

In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Pó) until his death in 1854.Howard Temperley, ‘Beecroft, John (1790–1854)’, rev. Elizabeth Baigent, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos under Oba Kosoko was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos (or Reduction of Lagos). The British installed Oba Akitoye, ousted Oba Kosoko, and signed a treaty on January 1, 1852 between Great Britain and Lagos that outlawed the slave trade, ushering in the consular period in Lagos' history, wherein Britain provided military protection to Lagos. ==Treaty Text== The text of the Lagos Treaty of 1852 is transcribed below: > Commodore Henry William Bruce, Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty’s ships and > vessels on the West Coast of Africa, and John Beecroft, Esquire. Her > Majesty's Consul in the Bights of Benin and Biafra, on the part of her > Majesty the Queen of England, and the King and Chiefs of Lagos and of the > neighbourhood, on the part of themselves and of their country, have agreed > upon the following Articles and Conditions: Article I > The export of slaves to foreign countries is for ever abolished in the > territories of the King and Chiefs of Lagos; and the King and the Chiefs of > Lagos; and the King and Chiefs of Lagos engage to make and to proclaim a law > prohibiting any of their subjects, or any person within their jurisdiction, > from selling or assisting in the sale of any slave for transportation to a > foreign country; and the King and Chiefs of Lagos promise to inflict a > severe punishment on any person who shall break the law. Article II > No European or other person whatever shall be permitted to reside within > the territory of the King and Chiefs of Lagos for the purpose of carrying on > in any way the traffic in Slaves; and no houses, or stores, or buildings of > any kind whatever shall be erected for the purpose of Slave Trade within the > territory of the King and Chiefs of Lagos; and if any such houses, stores, > or buildings shall at any future time be erected, and the King and Chiefs of > Lagos shall fail or be unable to destroy them, they may be destroyed by any > British officers employed for the suppression of the Slave Trade.

The Kinpurnie estate was historically a property owned by William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie by grant from King Robert the Bruce in 1317. It was later owned by James Stuart-Mackenzie, who built an observatory on Kinpurnie Hill. Kinpurnie was one of the estates purchased by shipping magnate Sir Charles Cayzer for his sons. He acquired it from the Earl of Wharncliffe’s trustees. Various ships of the Cayzer's Castle line were named after the Kinpurnie Castle. (This is incorrect, the Castle line was owned by Sir Donald Currie. There is however a connection as in 1956 the Cayzer's Clan Line merged with Union-Castle Line to form The British & Commonwealth Shipping Company, of which Sir Nicholas Cayzer was chairman) Kinpurnie Castle was built in 1907, in the Scots baronial style. It was designed by architect Patrick Thoms, of Thoms and Wilkie of Dundee, who trained with Charles Ower.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200230 The chimneypiece in the drawing room came from Ralston House. Ornamental plasterwork was done by the Bromsgrove Guild, and oak panelling by Methven, Hyslop & Co of Dundee. The estate also includes Thriepley House. In 2012, following the death of Sir James Cayzer, the estate was put up for sale. The castle was inherited by Sir James’ heir, Lord Rotherwick and sold in July 2015 for £2.09 million. ==References== Category:Castles in Angus Category:Listed castles in Scotland Category:Category B listed buildings in Angus Category:Country houses in Angus ","title":"Kinpurnie Castle"},{"id":"46388686","text":"2015 local election results in Mid Suffolk The 2015 Mid Suffolk District Council election took place on the 7 May 2015 to elect members of Mid Suffolk District Council in England.

Promoter Fritz Von Erich held two \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" events, one in June and one in October as well as a special \\"Christmas Star Wars\\" on December 25 of that year. ==Wrestling Star Wars (June)== Wrestling Star Wars (June 1981) was a professional wrestling supercard show that was held on June 4, 1981. The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based Big Time Wrestling (BTW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, the Dallas, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for BTW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. It is believed that the June 4, 1981 version of \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" was the first overall show in the \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" event chronology. The show was held at the Reunion Arena. Due to sparse records from 1981 the full show has not been found documented, only three matches on the show have been verified. Kerry Von Erich defeated Ernie Ladd to win the NWA American Heavyweight Championship on the show. As of May 2019, all known matches are available as Hidden Gems on the WWE Network.

The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based Big Time Wrestling (BTW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, the Dallas, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for BTW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. Records are not clear on if this show was the second or third overall show in the \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" event chronology. The show was held at the Reunion Arena. Big Time Wrestling promoter Fritz Von Erich's son Kevin Von Erich was supposed to team up with Kerry Von Erich on the show, but had to be replaced at the last moment by Terry Orndorff. Kerry Von Erich and Orndorff would go on to defeat the team of the Great Kabuki and Chan Chung to win the NWA American Tag Team Championship. Results ==Christmas Star Wars== Christmas Star Wars (1981) was a professional wrestling supercard show that was held on December 25, 1981 The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based Big Time Wrestling (BTW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, the Dallas, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for BTW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. The show was the third or fourth overall show in the \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" event chronology. The show was held at the Reunion Arena. The show was the first show to be billed as \\"Christmas Star Wars\\", starting an annual tradition that would last until 1987. For the show promoter Fritz Von Erich had brought in El Solitario from the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) in Mexico to defend the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship as part of the show. Fritz himself wrestled one of his last high-profile matches of his career as he took on and lost to the Great Kabuki in a \\"Texas death\\" match where there were no disqualifications. The main event was a 14-man battle royal featuring wrestlers that had already competed once that night.

On the night before Duryodhana's death, Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from the Yadu dynasty, would perish after 36 years. Krishna himself knew and wanted this to happen as he felt that the Yadavas had become very haughty and arrogant (adharmi), so he ended Gandhari's speech by saying \\"tathastu\\" (so be it). After 36 years passed, a fight broke out between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, then gave up his body using Yoga. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree. The Mahabharata also narrates the story of a hunter who becomes an instrument for Krishna's departure from the world. The hunter Jara, mistook Krishna's partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, wounding him mortally. After he realised the mistake, While still bleeding, Krishna told Jara, \\"O Jara, you were Vali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Treta Yuga. Here you had a chance to even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this\\". Then Krishna, with his physical body ascended back to his eternal abode, Goloka vrindavan and this event marks departure of Krishna from the earth. The news was conveyed to Hastinapur and Dwaraka by eyewitnesses to this event. The place of this incident is believed to be Bhalka, near Somnath temple. According to Puranic sources, Krishna's disappearance marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to February 17/18, 3102 BCE.See: Matchett, Freda, \\"The Puranas\\", p 139 and Yano, Michio, \\"Calendar, astrology and astronomy\\"' ==Story== As per the writing in Ramayana, Rama, i.e. Krishna in his earlier Rama Avatar (Avatars) is supposed to have given a boon to a monkey king Vali (Hindu mythology) whom he killed indirectly in hiding and not directly fighting with him in front. The above action of the hunter in Krishna avatar (Avatars) is supposed to be in compliance to the boon of Rama i.e. Krishna in his earlier Avatar. It is believed that Krishna left his footprints. It is a common site of pilgrimage for people who visit Somnath. ==Location== Bhalka Teerth is situated almost 4 kilometers away from the Somnath temple. Presently the government has planned to develop this temple also into a major tourist attraction. Somnath/Veraval City/Bhalka is very well connected via road and rail network. Nearest railway station is Veraval and the nearest airports are Diu & Rajkot.

A naval flight officer in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps is distinct from a naval aviator in that the aviator pilots the aircraft, while an NFO provides knowledge and expertise to assist piloting, such as in navigation, airborne weapons, aerodynamics, flight planning and safety. By virtue of being qualified for the Gray Owl Trophy, which by definition represents long years of dedicated service to the Navy or Marine Corps, the recipient is considered “a symbol of stalwart and intrepid professionalism.” Similar awards include the Gray Eagle Award, presented to the Naval Aviator on continuous active duty in the U.S Navy or Marine Corps who has held that designation for the longest period of time; the Ancient Albatross Award, an identical honor for United States Coast Guard aviators; the Old Salt Award, presented to the surface warfare officer serving on continuous active duty with the earliest surface warfare officer qualification, and the Old Goat, who is the longest serving Naval Academy graduate. ==History== Grumman Aerospace Corporation (now the Northrop Grumman Corp.) awarded the first Gray Owl Trophy to U.S. Navy Captain George N. LaRoque in June 1979. Original idea The award traces its origins to 1978, when U.S. Navy Captain Kenn Haas decided that there should be an award for the NFO community that equaled the Gray Eagle Trophy. Haas asked Grumman Aerospace Corporation to sponsor the award, the proposal was accepted and the first formal presentation of the Gray Owl was held the next year. Haas later became the third recipient of the Gray Owl in 1983. ==Trophy== A Gray Owl Award. The trophy takes the form of a sculpture of an owl mounted atop a mahogany base. Each recipient’s name plus the date and duration of their time holding the Gray Owl are engraved on the trophy. The Gray Owl Trophy may be kept in possession of and displayed by the command to which the Gray Owl is assigned. Otherwise, it may be placed in the custody of the National Museum of Naval Aviation on a temporary basis until required for presentation to the successor. When the incumbent retires or dies, the award is passed from the previous holder to the next earliest designated NFO on active duty. The ceremony should be conducted as near as practicable to the official date of succession with both principals present, unless physically impossible. “…Presentation ceremonies, while perhaps light, should be nonetheless dignified.” ==Eligibility== Eligibility for the Gray Owl Trophy Award is determined by the official active-duty precedence list for NFOs, on continuous service, not recalled, who has held that designation for the longest period of time. The date of designation as an NFO is the governing factor for determining who will receive the award from the list of active duty officers. In the event two or more NFOs on active duty have been designated on the same date, the senior one qualifies as the Gray Owl. ==Recipients== ADM Harris accepts the Gray Owl Award from Northrop Grumman executive and retired U.S. Navy Captain Brick Nelson, 13 November 2015. The most recent “Gray Owl” was Vice Admiral Walter E. Carter Jr.. He was passed on the award by VADM Herman A. Shelanski, Naval Inspector General, until the later's retirement on 1 August 2018. Shelanski received the trophy and title from Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., Commander, U.S. Pacific Command, in a ceremony at the National Naval Aviation Museum on 10 May 2018.

The tomb is of octagonal plan. He was experienced in the management of engineering works, especially the construction of canals, and worked on many large projects in the Mughal territories in modern Pakistan and Afghanistan. He was appointed as the governor of Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul, then of the Punjab in 1639. Khan died in 1657 while going to Kashmir. Though Khan was an engineer and courtier, he has come to be locally regarded as a notable spiritual figure, and locals call the tomb Mardan Khan's durbar (shrine). The grave is in a chamber below ground level, accessed by stairs, and has been decorated by visitors as though it were a saint's shrine. ==Architecture== The corners of the tombs once all had small domes. The tomb is now in a semi-ruined state, lacking its decorations, though the main structure is intact. This is in brick with a dome of in diameter above an octagonal drum with iwans on each side. There are kiosks around the top of the drum. The tomb stands on an octagonal podium, with each side at the edge. It would have been originally decorated with stone facings and inlays (kashi kari), and fresco paintings, some traces of which remain on the tomb. The two storey gatehouse has retained much more of its decoration; originally there were perhaps four gateways. The tomb would have stood in the centre of a paradise garden as other Mughal tombs do. ==Conservation== The tomb is surrounded by railway property, and located in Mughalpura road (which was earlier known as Vetman Road or Wheatman Road) which is from right from the Grand Trunk Road. Near the railway track on the road is a sign board where \\"MET-1\\" is written, beyond which lies the gate through which people can access the tomb, through a passageway. ==Gallery== File:Nawab_Ali-Mardan_Khan.jpgThe tomb was built for Nawab Ali Mardan Khan.

The race took place on 15 July 1922 and was run to a formula stipulating that maximum engine capacity should not exceed 2 litres and that the cars should be two-seaters weighing not less than 650 kg. The formula was to remain in force for four years producing \\"fields of brilliance to be unequalled for many years\\" it was the first rolling massed start in the history of Grand Prix motor-racing. Three Ernest Henry-designed team cars were constructed for the event and a similar fourth test car served as a test, practice and spare car until its engine was ruined by fire before the race.The Boys’ Life of Sir Henry Segrave, Capt. Malcolm Campbell and J Wentworth Day p. 80Sir Henry Segrave, Cyril Posthumus, 1961 p. 87Motor Sport 1979 August William BoddySunbeam Talbot Darracq, Journal of the STD Register, Number 180 Winter 2007, Oliver Heal and Bruce Dowell, pp. 31–35 During the race the engines in all three Sunbeam team cars failed and none finished. After the Grand Prix one of the Sunbeam cars was entered in a Brooklands race, which it won. All four cars were subsequently sold to privateers and entered in various events with varied levels of success. All three team cars and the test/practice car survive as a rare example of a complete British Works team of the Vintage era. However, only one is original; the other three are genuine, authentic and resurrected.Directory of Historic Racing Cars, Denis Jenkinson, 1987 pp. 11–12 ==The course== The course near the French city of Strasbourg was roughly a triangular of unpaved public roads with three near straights and three sharp corners. The start line where elaborate viewing tribunes and fronting ‘pits’ were built was at Duppigheim, first corner was at Entzheim, second at Innenheim, and final corner at Duttlenheim. It was long, requiring 60 laps to complete the .Grand Prix de L’A.C.F. Strasbourg 1922 75eme Anniversaire, Bernard Truche, 1997 pp. 9–17 == The 1922 Grand Prix de l’ACF == In practice it became clear that the Fiat team had superior speed; Sunbeam axle ratio were lowered to improve speed. In the race, the Sunbeams could not match the performance of the Fiats, safe engine revolutions were exceeded and the inlet valves fractured; the Sunbeams were ‘put out of running’. Jean Chassagne in car No.9, the team leader and winner of that year's IoM T.T. with a modified 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam retired after only five laps as did K. Lee Guinness in car No.16. Segrave, in car No.21, the junior team member, in his second ever Grand Prix lasted ‘approximately half the full distance’. He was later to remember this event as ‘sheer misery’ (not least due to chemical fuel burns on his backside sustained by fuel spillage, the result of a hurried and untidy refuelling); he did hold a fourth place behind the Fiats for most of his race. ==1922 Brooklands== On 30 September 1922 the Essex M.C. put over a series of Speed Championships. The 2-litre 8.5mile event was won in one of the Grand Prix Sunbeams by H.O.D. Segrave at 92.81 mph, fastest lap 99.81 mph. This was the only success these cars obtained for Sunbeam. ==Aftermath== The failure of the cars had irreparable damage on their designer Ernest Henry's reputation and career. Despite the mechanical weakness of its rear axle, the performance of the Fiat 804 convinced Louis Coatalen, Sunbeam's general manager, to use the design as inspiration for his winning series of Grand Prix cars between 1923 -1925. The 1922 Sunbeam engines which failed during the race were repaired, the advanced servo operated brake systems were removed and installed in the 1923 Grand Prix Sunbeams. The gear lever was repositioned to the centre of the cockpit. A few years later after a ‘cooling period’ the cars were sold into private hands. All three 1922 team cars as well as the fourth Test / Practice car survive today; a rare survival of a complete Grand Prix team of the vintage era. However, only one is original (Sunbeam II); the other three are genuine, authentic and resurrected (Sunbeam III, Test/ Practice, and Sunbeam I respectively). ==Design== Designed by Ernest Henry in Suresnes, with input from Louis Coatalen and the Sunbeam Experimental Department Wolverhampton. Jean Chassagne was liaising and also in charge of testing. Before the Great War Ernest Henry was a part of the successful and innovative ‘Charlatans’ who designed the first ever double overhead cams four valve Grand Prix engines for the 1912 Peugeot;The Classic Twin-Cam Engine, Griffith Borgeson, 1981 pp. 13–18 (many further mentions throughout the book) the 1922 Sunbeam design follows similar principles.The Classic Twin-Cam Engine, Griffith Borgeson, 1981 pp. 94–96 The aluminum body was the latest in streamlining and is typical of the Post Great War Henry design with the spare wheel carried longitudinally in the tail and braced by the large fuel tank. Each of the three team cars was designed around its intended driver integrating each driver's requirements and preferences. The asymmetrically inclined valves (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical) were a significant departure for Henry and may be attributable to Sunbeam and Coatalen whose interest in desaxé configuration dated to 1911. Another unusual detail was the engine mounted directly on the chassis frame similarly to the 1921 'invincible Talbot-Darracq'. Following tests in Brooklands and Isle of Man prior to the Grand Prix, modifications were instigated to the tail support bracket.The TASO Mathieson & K Taylor Photographic and Document Archive – DA6436 at Brooklands vs. DA6436 Strasbourg practice Different carburetor configurations and different tyre types were tried, axle ratios experimented with, aero screens and mudguards were installed or removed as required.

Instruments *Jaeger revolution counter driven from the forward end of the camshaft, Sunbeam oil pressure gauge, fuel tank air pressure gauge, twin magneto switches, twin glass oil restrictors. *Under- reading of 300rpm on the Jaeger revolution counter was a contributing factor in over-stressing the engines during the race. *Each dashboard and instrument arrangement was tailor-made to the requirements of the pilots ==History of individual cars== The Sunbeam Works records showing chassis and engine numbers, against a team driver did not survive; however, records of chassis numbers raced at Brooklands did survive.The Strasbourg Sunbeam, Neville S Webb, 2006 pp. 200–201’ The Bill Perkins diary’ Research of the history of individual cars derived from analysis of photographs and related period documents was carried out and published by William (Bill) Boody, Neville Webb and Bruce Dowell with various results. Works history is incomplete and in some instances deduced. The post Works history and race record of the cars is generally agreed on. A test car was constructed, tested and modified after which three team cars were assembled at the Sunbeam Wolverhapmpton Experimental Department. For the purpose of the Grand Prix the three Works team cars were designated Sunbeam I, II and III for Jean Chassagne (riding mechanic Robert Laly), Major H.O.D. Segrave (riding mechanic Jules Moriceau), K. Lee Guinness (riding mechanic Bill Perkins) respectively.Automobilia 15 Julliet 1922 No124 p. 20 The test car became the Strasbourg spare car and was used in practice by all three team members;The TASO Mathieson & K Taylor Photographic and Document Archive – images of DA6436 with the three team members \\"Guinness, Chassagne and myself [Segrave] put any amount of time on the course\\".

Identity plates attached to the firewall and cockpit are stamped ‘Engine No.1’ and ‘Chassis No. 1’ but are not of Sunbeam typeface and were made in the 1970s. Registration number DA6436. The first car to be built; unpainted it was tested by J Chassagne the liaison officer for the project at Brooklands; this resulted in variety of modifications notably re-configuring of the support bracket for the tail. It was shipped to the Isle of Man registered DA6436 and was tested again during practice for the 1922 Tourist Trophy and was found comparable to the 1922 3-litre Tourist Trophy Grand Prix Sunbeams. Later that year in Strasbourg, it was used by all three Team drivers for practice until its engine was ruined by fire before the race.The Boys’ Life of Sir Henry Segrave, Capt.

The identity of this car as chassis no.3 is confirmed by Oliver Heal and Bruce Dowell as well as Neville Webb. *The acutely upswept scuttle shape of K. Lee Guinness car no.16 in the 1922 Strasbourg G.P. is unmistakable and ties it with the car today and RU-2497 in 1930 Scotland this is further corroborated \\"The car was No.3\\". *The chassis number (No.3) ties it to J S Spencer car at Brooklands in 1926 where it was supported by K. Lee Guinness 1922 G.P. riding mechanic Bill Perkins. *The identity of Sunbeam III in the 1922 Strasbourg G.P. is further corroborated by: wider collar fuel inlet set some 3’’ from the trim, the position of the tax disc, the front strap buckle position, the gap between the trim and connecting strip and the connecting strip rivets – all characteristic of car no. 16 and visible post-works; all three team cars have fluted seats and no visible tail rivets.

She left Germany in 1933 to escape the Nazi regime, but twenty years later, after returning to Germany was arrested and for several years imprisoned, in the aftermath of the Noel Field espionage affair. She was married three times and accordingly may appear in sources under any one of the following four names: *Anna Wiedemann *Anna Leibbrand *Anna von Fischer (Anna Josephine Fischer as the author of Hinter den sieben Bergen (1945)) *Anna Schlotterbeck ==Life== Anna Wiedemann was born in Munich where her father worked as a printer, and where she attended elementary school, after which she moved to a School of Mechanical Engineering in Esslingen, emerging in the third year of the war, 1917, with a qualification in Technical Drawing. She then took a job as a graphic artist and typist with Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart-Feuerbach. 1918 was the year of her sixteenth birthday and it was the year when she joined the Socialist Young Workers Association and the Free Socialist Youth Organisation. It was also the year of German defeat in the First World War, which was followed by many months of national and regional revolution. She participated in the Spartacus League's battles in Stuttgart that took place between November 1918 and January 1919. In 1924 she became a member of the recently established German Communist Party, becoming a member of the party's youth wing leadership for the regional parties in Königsberg, Danzig, Halle and for Berlin itself. In 1923 she had married Robert Leibbrand, a leading Party Official from Stuttgart. By 1927 they were living in Moscow where she worked for the Comintern as a typist till 1929. When the couple returned to Berlin in 1929 Anna Leibbrand became the party women's section head for the Berlin-Brandenburg district. She was also working as an editor on a party newspaper called \\"Die Arbeiterin\\" (literally \\"The [female] Worker\\"). Until 1933 she also sat on the district council. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in switching to one- party government in Germany. All political parties (other than the Nazi Party) were now illegal, but the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. Anna and Robert Leibbrand nevertheless continued with their (now illegal) party work. On 24 March 1933 Robert Leibbrand was arrested: he would spend most of the twelve Nazi years in a succession of jails and concentration camps. Anna had not been with her husband when he was arrested and she continued with her own party work till July 1933. In September 1933, however, she emigrated to Switzerland where she took work as a domestic servant. She immediately joined the Swiss Communist Party, remaining a member of it and of its successor party till 1948. After a couple of years she obtained a job as a doctor's assistant. In 1938 Anna and Robert Leibbrand were divorced and in 1939 she married her employer, the doctor Hans von Fischer also, in the process, taking Swiss citizenship. It was also during this time that, together with Hans von Fischer, she set up in Zurich the \\"Centrale Sanitaire Internationale\\", a left-wing medical charity initially intended to provide medical support to fighters in the Spanish Civil War. She also undertook illegal work for the Italian Communist Party at this time. Switzerland's neutral status during the Second World War enabled Anna von Fischer to work with left-leaning political and medical support organisations in various countries both during and directly after the war. War ended, formally in May 1945, but at the direction of the German senior Communist, Franz Dahlem, she remained in Switzerland for a further three years. Her contacts during the 1940s included Noel Field, a leading member of the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, a disaster relief and refugee support organisation with close US links. In 1946 she warned the Party leadership in what would later be East Germany that Noel Field was an alleged agent of the US security services. She finally returned to what remained of German in October 1948, settling in the Soviet occupation zone. The end of the war had appeared to signal an end to one- party dictatorship, but under Soviet administration the contentious merger of the KPD and more moderately left-wing SPD had already, in April 1946 prepared the ground for a return to one- party rule. Anna von Fischer joined the resulting Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) in 1949, which was also the year in which the zone became the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October. After a period of unemployment, in 1949 she took a job as a correspondent with Tägliche Rundschau, a Dresden based newspaper produced for East Germany by the Red Army. She stayed with the newspaper till the start of August 1951. She was also working with the Soviet Press Bureau, and in 1950 found time, briefly, to attend a course of political study at the regional party academy. Meanwhile, she was by now living with another high- profile party member, the writer Friedrich Schlotterbeck, whom she married in March 1951. In February 1951, following an intervention by the then highly active Regional Party Control Commission (Landesparteikontrollkommission) for Saxony, she was summarily expelled from the country's ruling SED (party) on \\"suspicion of espionage\\". They found themselves invited to demonstrate their loyalty to the state by outstanding work at the infamous uranium mines nearby. On 15 March 1953 Freidrich and Anna Schlotterbeck were both arrested without being told why, because of \\"criminal relationships with the American\\". The American in question was a double (or possibly triple) agent called Noel Field, a committed communist who seems to have been providing intelligence to various security agencies and whose revelations provide a rich if confusing backdrop to a number of show trials in East Germany and several surrounding states in the fevered cold war atmosphere of the early 1950s. In 1941 Anna von Fischer had indeed passed to Field numerous addresses of emigrants of various nationalities. During their time in Switzerland Freidrich Schlotterbeck and Anna von Fischer (as she had then been) were also on friendly terms with Herta Jurr-Tempi who may have been a Gestapo informer. Following their arrest, Anna's daughter by her former marriage to Robert Leibbrand was placed in a children's home, while Anna Schlotterbeck was detained by the Ministry for State Security successively in Chemnitz, Berlin and Rostock. Slightly more than a year following her arrest it was in Rostock on 27 April 1954 that she had her moment in court, which resulted in a four-year prison sentence for \\"crimes under Article 6 of the East German constitution in connection with an offence against Control Council Directve 38\\".\\"Verbrechens gemäß Artikel 6 der DDR in Verbindung mit einem Vergehen gegen die Kontrollratsdirektive 38\\" Both Friedrich and Anna Schlotterbeck were released from prison early in 1956, however. Release was followed by the usual unpublicised rehabilitation and quiet readmission into the ruling SED (party). The punishment was deleted from the official record in 1957. Friedrich and Anna Schlotterbeck settled in Groß Glienicke near Potsdam, supporting themselves by writing books and radio plays. They wrote several radio plays together including Die Memoiren der Frau Viktoria (1962), and became close friends with fellow writers Gerhard and Christa Wolf. In 1968 Anna Schlotterbeck prepared a manuscript entitled \\"Hohenschönhausen, Zelle 51\\", which dealt with her experiences of state detention in East Germany, and which was published in the West in 1986, some fourteen years following her death in 1972. East German fellow-citizens would need to await German reunification in 1990 before being able to access a copy legally. ==References== Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Category:Exiles from Nazi Germany Category:1902 births Category:1972 deaths Category:20th-century German women writers Category:20th-century German non-fiction writers ","title":"Anna Leibbrand"},{"id":"46389047","text":"Salisbury Railroad Corridor Historic District is a national historic district located at Salisbury, Rowan County, North Carolina.

He first gained mainstream recognition after being featured on Naughty Boy's \\"Home\\" and penning \\"My Loving,\\" \\"Long Hard Look\\" and \\"Doubt\\" for Mary J. Blige, which were released on her thirteenth studio album, The London Sessions. Other artists he has penned for include Demi Lovato, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Elton John, Clean Bandit, Jonas Blue, AlunaGeorge, Disclosure, Claudia Leitte, Little Mix, DNCE, Ella Mai and more. ==Early life== Romans was born in Pinner, Middlesex, which also is the birthplace and childhood residence of Elton John, whom he cites as one of his key-influences. He taught himself to play guitar, cello, piano, drums, and saxophone, as well as teaching himself how to produce. His first gig was the Northwood Hills hotel at the age of 13 (the same venue as Elton John's first show), and he left school at 16 to pursue music full-time. ==Career== His music style has been described as a mix of soul, pop and hip-hop. His early career included the release of numerous singles in the United Kingdom. In July 2014, RØMANS was featured on \\"Home\\" off Naughty Boy's debut-album, Hotel Cabana, their collaboration was released as a single. On 6 May 2014, it was announced that he had signed a record deal with Roc Nation. Having previously focussed on EPs, 2016's Silence and 2017's Automatic, his third and fourth releases overall, received radio support from BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac, Clara Amfo and Toddla T, as well as 1Xtra's MistaJam and DJ Target. Rarely performing live, he played The Fader's infamous Fader Fort stage at SXSW and has continued to receive support from the publication, along with other tastemakers including Spin, Wonderland, Pigeons & Planes and The Line Of Best Fit. He sees his own music as a creative necessity that complements the process of his songwriting career. \\"If I do a month of writing with other people I’m suddenly like, ‘Right, I need to just go home, be on my own, and play some fucking weird guitar shit,’” he explains. “I think it’s also partly because there’s a natural frustration there as a writer: a lot of stuff gets wasted and sits on hard drives forever. I couldn’t just write for other people and do the conveyor belt of songwriting if I didn’t have an area where I can make things to my taste\\".

For many years the oasis was a camp and watering spot on a long used trail along the oasis's at the foot of the mountains east of the Salton Sink to the Yuma Crossing and Yuma, Arizona to the southeast. From 1862, it became a camp and watering stop for gold seekers and other travelers along the Bradshaw Trail between San Bernardino and the gold mining boomtown of La Paz, Arizona and later to nearby Ehrenberg that replaced it.

The film stars Cameron Dallas, Matt Shively, Lia Marie Johnson, Marcus Johns, Andrea Russett, Kristina Hayes and Teala Dunn. Most of the cast are popular online internet personalities. The film began a limited release in theatres on December 12, 2014, before being released on video on demand December 16, 2014 by 20th Century Fox. ==Plot== Felix O'Neil is a mischievous prankster who believes that school is a waste of time. He gets expelled after receiving his third suspension from the school Dean of Students, Gary Truman. For several days, Felix covers up his expulsion with the help of his best friend, Danny. A week before report cards are supposed to be mailed, Felix makes a deal with his ex-girlfriend, Vanessa, where he will help her win a class election against her rival, Stacy, and in exchange Vanessa, Mr. Truman's assistant, will print a straight A report card for Felix. Felix and Danny hack Stacy's computer, and learn that she is a notorious cyber bully who goes by the screen-name of Roxy. Felix is able to get into the school and expose Stacy. That night, Felix arrives home and finds his report card in the mail; Vanessa, however, lied and gave him Fs. Felix barely keeps his parents from finding out; in retaliation, he ruins the school play Vanessa stars in. After escaping from Truman, he is able to lie to his parents and convince Danny to help him break into school to fix his grades. Truman, however, catches him in the act, and calls the police, who arrest Felix. Felix's brother Ben, who broke out of the Montana Mountain Academy by shipping himself out to their house, is able to bail Felix out. When they get home, their mom, Julie, pressures Felix about the report card and to convince Danny to give it to him. His parents are shocked, and Julie schedules a conference with his history teacher, Mr. Harris, as Mr. Harris had contacted Felix's parents about his failures in his class. Felix hires the school janitor to pose as his history teacher, who meets with Felix at his house. Ben, shocked, accidentally knocks him out. Felix, having no other choice, goes with Julie to the meeting. Ben attempts to stop the meeting, but fails. Felix's history teacher is about to tell Julie about Felix's expulsion when Ben knocks him out. Julie finds Ben in the hallway, and even though Felix denies knowledge of it, Julie grounds him. Ben is sent back to the academy, but not before planning his next escape; meanwhile, Julie is doing everything to meet with Truman about Felix. A delivery pizza girl, Katie, convinces him to find a way to get Truman to re- enroll him. After getting into the school, they see Truman late at night, doing something on his computer. Deducing something is suspicious, Felix convinces Danny to bug his computer, and learns that Truman is a gambling addict who has stolen some school money to support his addiction. Felix blackmails Truman to re-enroll him, threatening to report him to the police for embezzlement if he refuses. Truman begins the re-enrollment process, but Vanessa sees Felix's name on the form, and eventually figures out that Felix is blackmailing him. She agrees to help Truman, and steals back the evidence of his addiction, in the form of Danny's hard drive. After Felix and Danny realize that the evidence is missing, they head to the school, where Truman gloats to Felix about beating him. Danny, however, steals Truman's laptop, which has clear evidence of his activity. Julie arrives, and Truman lies about Felix, stating that he is an exemplary student, that he has participated in many extra-curricular activities, and that Felix's \\"Straight A\\" report card was not faked. Julie's suspicions about the report card being faked are therefore relieved. Felix is re-enrolled for the next semester at Eastwood High, and wins Katie's affection. Although he still does not understand the importance of school, he works harder and earns better grades. ==Cast== * Cameron Dallas as Felix O'Neil, a prankster * Matt Shively as Danny, Felix's best friend * Lia Marie Johnson as Katie, a pizza delivery girl who becomes Felix's girlfriend * Marcus Johns as Ben O'Neil, Felix's brother * Andrea Russett as Vanessa, Felix's ex-girlfriend * Emilio Palame as Gary Truman, the school dean * Kristina Hayes as Julie O'Neil, Felix's mom * Teala Dunn as Emily, Vanessa's best friend * Michelle Glavin as Stacy, a student who accused Felix of spying on her in the restroom in freshman year * Circus-Szalewski as Shamus, the school janitor * Tom McLaren as Phil O'Neil, Felix's dad * Stevie Mack as Mr. Harris, Felix's history teacher * Rene Michelle Aranda as Felix's arresting officer ==Production== In April 2014, AwesomenessTV CEO Brian Robbins announced he was making a film starring Dallas.

Randell was commander of the Bellaventure which rescued 420 members of the crew of the SS Newfoundland who had survived what is now known as the 1914 sealing disaster. The men had endured two nights of freezing rain and blowing snow on the North Atlantic ice fields without shelter or food. One of the rescued men died shortly afterwards in St. John's where the survivors had been brought for medical care. The crew of the Bellaventure also recovered the bodies of 69 men who had not survived the ordeal. Randell joined A.H.

He served as the first Vicar Apostolic of Belize from 1893-1898. He is widely regarded as the most important figure in consolidating the Catholic presence in Belize in the second half of the 19th century. ==Missionary to Central America== Salvatore di Pietro was born in Palermo, Italy, on 15 June 1830. He entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in October 1845 and was ordained a priest on 2 June 1859. He arrived in British Honduras (now known as \\"Belize\\") on 22 March 1869. On May 12 he suffered an attack of yellow fever. His superiors transferred him to Guatemala, where he preached missions to the Garifuna. He was appointed head of the missions in northern Guatemala, but along with 80 other Jesuits fled the country in September 1871 when the Liberals gained control and persecuted the Catholic Church.Woods, Charles M. Sr, et al. Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524-2014. (Belize: Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan, 2015). In 1872 president Jose Maria Medina invited him to Spanish Honduras to found a college in the capital Comayagua. He began by preaching missions in Omoa and San Pedro Sula. However, the Liberals took control of Spanish Honduras also and he returned to Belize. ==Mission superior== In 1851 Jesuits had been placed in charge of the Catholic mission in Belize, with George Avvaro serving as first Superior in 1853. In September 1872 di Pietro was appointed to replace the aging Avvaro. But in October 1874 di Pietro needed relief and John Pittar was made Superior. Di Pietro became pastor in Corozal in the north of Belize until June 1876 when, weak from sickness, he was sent to Panama to recover his strength. He served as secretary to the Bishop of Panama. By October 1878 Pittar was having serious health problems and di Pietro returned to be Superior, remaining so until his death in 1898. The Superior resided at Holy Redeemer parish in Belize Town. From his close association with Henry Fowler, the first Catholic colonial administrator (1877-1886), keeper of the government records and producer of the Honduras Almanack, di Pietro wrote accounts to acquaint his Superiors in England with Belize and to attract assistance of funds and manpower.di Pietro, Salvatore (1 March 1883). \\"Letter on the history of the Mission 1850-1883,\\" Letters & Notices: British Honduras, (London: English Province of the Society of Jesus, Vol. 16, pp. 217-227. Under di Pietro's watch, Cassian Gillett founded at Holy Redeemer St. John's College, which would educate many future leaders for Belize and neighboring republics. Also, di Pietro was the impetus for bringing to Belize three congregations of religious sisters. The Sisters of Mercy were the first to arrive. After his visit to the motherhouse in New Orleans in 1892, the Sisters of Mercy began arriving in Belize. On the event Pope Leo XIII sent a special blessing for this first establishment of congregation in the tropics.14 January 1883. The New Orleans Morning Star. Next the Holy Family Sisters arrived in 1898. These African-American sisters, founded by Henriette DeLille, came to manage the school in the Garifuna settlement of Dangriga. The third religious community of sisters to arrive in Belize were the Carmelites. The Church in the northern districts was well- established and Bishop di Pietro was anxious about the education of the children there. In 1899, four sisters of the Third Order of Mount Carmel in New Orleans came to serve in Orange Walk. ==Prefect Apostolic, Vicar, and first Bishop for Belize== di Pietro with Hopkins to his right and Cassian Gillett in rear 3rd from left In 1879 the direct route by steamship from Jamaica to Belize ended, complicating travel for the Vicar Apostolic in Jamaica to reach Belize. In the absence of the Vicar, the mission superior di Pietro administered Confirmation within the Colony. In his visit to Rome in 1888, di Pietro proposed that because of the great distance between Jamaica and Belize (750 miles), the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in Rome make Belize a Prefecture independent of Jamaica. Those in Rome concurred and he was made Prefect Apostolic on 10 June 1888. Then on 14 January 1893 the Roman authorities appointed di Pietro titular Bishop of Eurea and Vicar- Apostolic of British Honduras. The consecration took place in Belize on 16 April 1893 with Bishop Thomas A. Becker of Savannah, Georgia, as consecrator, assisted by Bishop Jeremiah O'Sullivan of Mobile, Alabama, and Bishop Thomas Heslin of Natchez, Mississippi. In the following year responsibility for the Belize mission was transferred from the English Province to the Missouri Province of Jesuits. The mission which began in 1852 with no church, few Catholics, and 2 priests after 40 years numbered 20,000 Catholics among a population of 31,000 inhabitants, in 6 town churches – Belize Town, Corozal, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, and El Cayo – and 39 outstation chapels.

Founded by Paul Soulellis in 2013, the collection was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art Library in January 2017. The project has been described as \\"web culture articulated as printed artifact,\\" an \\"archive of archives,\\" characterized as an \\"accumulation of accumulations,\\" much of it printed on demand. Techniques for appropriating web content used by artists in the collection include grabbing, hunting, scraping and performing, detailed by Soulellis in \\"Search, Compile, Publish,\\" and later referenced by Alessandro Ludovico. Printed Web 1, launched in January 2014, featured work by 300x300px Among the 130 artists included in Library of the Printed Web are Olia Lialina, Mishka Henner, Clement Valla, Karolis Kosas, Lauren Thorson, Cory Arcangel, Silvio Lorusso, Angela Genusa, Jean Keller, Aaron Krach, Joachim Schmid, Benjamin Shaykin, Chantal Zakari, Richard Prince, David Horvitz and Penelope Umbrico. Over 240 works are in the collection. Library of the Printed Web continues to grow through curatorial acquisition and artist contributions. The collection is used primarily for experimental publishing research, as a way to question issues of copyright, privacy and appropriation by artists on the internet, and as the basis for academic workshops in design and new media. The project is frequently featured at book fairs, independent publishing conferences and schools, appearing at Miss Read Berlin Art Book Fair, Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart, Merz Akademie, Printed Matter's NY Art Book Fair, Offprint London, Theorizing the Web, Interrupt 3 at Brown University, The Internet Yami-Ichi, Printed Matter's LA Art Book Fair, Odds and Ends Art Book Fair at Yale Art Gallery, Rhode Island School of Design School of Visual Arts, International Center of Photography, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and Offprint Paris.

The project began in 2014 as a way to present new work by artists included in Soulellis’ Library of the Printed Web. Artists are invited to submit new or existing network-based work for the printed page. In the spirit of Seth Siegelaub, each issue is curated as a group exhibition for the printed page. Printed Web circulates primarily as print-on-demand publications, but also includes PDFs, ZIPs, GIFs, and server directories. More than 180 artists and writers have contributed to the project through issue #4. Individual issues are widely held in special artists’ publications collections and libraries, including Museum of Modern Art NY, Yale University, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Center, and NY Public Library. Printed Web 2 was included in the exhibition \\"Aerial Imagery in Print, 1860 to Today\\" at Museum of Modern Art, organized by MoMA Library, featuring a project by James Bridle. Printed Web 3 was an open call and launched on the front page of Rhizome and at Offprint London in May 2015, featuring work by 147 artists. Printed Web 4 was a co-publication with International Center of Photography and featured in the exhibition \\"Public, Private, Secret,\\" curated by Charlotte Cotton in June 2016.

The term is attributed to Hermann Joseph Muller, who observed that one crossover \\"interferes with the coincident occurrence of another crossing over in the same pair of chromosomes, and I have accordingly termed this phenomenon ‘interference’.\\" A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. Meiotic crossovers (COs) appear to be regulated to ensure that COs on the same chromosome are distributed far apart (crossover interference). In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) outnumber COs. Thus not all DSBs are repaired by a recombination process(es) leading to COs. The RTEL-1 protein is required to prevent excess meiotic COs. In rtel-1 mutants meiotic CO recombination is significantly increased and crossover interference appears to be absent. RTEL1 likely acts by promoting synthesis-dependent strand annealing which results in non-crossover (NCO) recombinants instead of COs (see diagram). Normally, about half of all DSBs are converted into NCOs. RTEL-1 appears to enforce meiotic crossover interference by directing the repair of some DSBs towards NCOs rather than COs. In humans, recombination rate increases with maternal age. Furthermore, placement of female recombination events appears to become increasingly deregulated with maternal age, with a larger fraction of events occurring within closer proximity to each other than would be expected under simple models of crossover interference. ==High negative interference== Bacteriophage T4 High negative interference (HNI), in contrast to positive interference, refers to the association of recombination events ordinarily measured over short genomic distances, usually within a gene. Over such short distances there is a positive correlation (negative interference) of recombinational events. As studied in bacteriophage T4 this correlation is greater the shorter the interval between the sites used for detection.Chase M, Doermann AH. High Negative Interference over Short Segments of the Genetic Structure of Bacteriophage T4. Genetics. 1958 May;43(3):332-53. PMID: 17247760 HNI is due to multiple exchanges within a short region of the genome during an individual mating event.Edgar RS, Steinberg CM. On the origin of high negative interference over short segments of the genetic structure of bacteriophage T4. Virology. 1958 Aug;6(1):115-28. PMID: 13626191 What is counted as a “single exchange” in a genetic cross involving only distant markers may in reality be a complex event that is distributed over a finite region of the genome.Steinberg CM, Edgar RS.A critical test of a current theory of genetic recombination in bacteriophage.

PMID: 13916671 PMCID:PMC1210322 Switching between template DNA strands during DNA synthesis (see Figure, SDSA pathway), referred to as copy-choice recombination, was proposed to explain the positive correlation of recombination events within the gene.Bernstein H.

Reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two RNA genome copies (copy-choice recombination).Rawson JMO, Nikolaitchik OA, Keele BF, Pathak VK, Hu WS.

It was held at the Louisiana International Speedway in Prairieville, Louisiana, about 65 miles up the Mississippi River from New Orleans and 15 miles south of Baton Rouge. Over 26 bands performed during the three days of the festival, including seven veterans of Woodstock. It had a peak attendance of 25,000–30,000 people. ==Background== The summer of 1969 saw a proliferation of the relatively new concert genre of pop/rock festivals. While the cultural highlight was undoubtedly the Woodstock Music and Art Fair on August 15–18, 1969, near White Lake, New York, the New Orleans Pop Festival was among several major pop festivals held that year in the deep South. Unlike several other pop festivals around the country, the local citizenry and governmental bodies were tolerant though wary of such a large crowd. The experiences of other festival promoters having to fight local government ordinances and prohibitions was not shared by promoter Steve Kapelow and his sponsoring company, Kesi, Inc, with the result that concert preparations were complete upon commencement of the festival. The fall of 1969 saw the beginning of court-ordered integration of area schools, and racial tensions were high. Because of several incidents of violence resulting from racial incidents, local towns were under a tight night curfew, although that curfew did not extend to the concert site. ==Preparation== Promoter Steve Kapelow, 27 at the time and a fellow musician, described the preparations for the festival by telling a UPI reporter, \\"We expect 15,000–20,000 in light of advance ticket sales, but we have prepared for double that.\\" Kapelow explained that their extra preparations were costing more money than was likely necessary, \\"but we'd rather do that than have the industry suffer another disaster,\\" referring to Woodstock where attendance was vastly greater than anticipated, and preparations were inadequate. Kapelow pointed out that he was confident in his attendance projections because the Louisiana population base was much smaller than that of the New York area, that there was another pop festival in the Dallas area on the same weekend that would compete for attendees, and that destruction from Hurricane Camille, which made its U.S. landfall on July 18 in the Biloxi/Gulfport, Mississippi area would likely reduce attendance from the Gulf Coast. The stage was built in the straightaway of the race track on the opposite side of the infield to the grandstand, with capacities of 60,000 and 11,000 respectively. The stage itself was double wide, with two separate light and sound systems, making a large jam session with several groups possible and greatly reducing the intermission between performers. Kapelow and fellow promoter Joe Kaplan attended several previous pop festivals to get an idea of what sort of preparations were necessary, and that work resulted in what was reported as \\"an abundance of food and drink and other supplies.\\" Hundreds of portable toilets and 50-gallon drums of water were scattered around the race track, and limited showers were available to festival goers. The festival was originally planned for two days, but a free Saturday evening show was added. Sunday tickets went for $7.00 for advance tickets and $9.50 at the gate, while Monday prices were $8.00 in advance and $10.50 at the gate. Tickets for the entire festival cost $13.00 in advance and $16.00 at the gate (an estimated $83.00 and $102.00, respectively, in 2015 dollars). ==Concert crowd== Uniformed law enforcement restricted themselves to traffic control in the access roads. Although there were 116+ undercover narcotic officers, drug use was such that only 37 drug arrests were made, with the focus being the sellers rather than the users. Promoters had arranged for several motorcycle clubs to handle internal security, and apparently did a good job. Local Sheriff H. M. Waguespack praised the behavior of the crowd, saying that things were going much better than he had expected. Local towns were under a tight night curfew due to violence resulting from racial incidents because of the recent court- ordered integration of area schools, but the sheriff's office declined to extend the curfew to the festival site. A medical team hired by the promoters handled a few cases of drug overdoses, but most cases were related to insect bites and cuts incurred by walking on broken glass. Peak attendance occurred on Sunday; law enforcement estimated 20,000–25,000 and the promoters' estimate was 30,000–35,000. ==Schedule== The schedule of the festival is known with relative certainty. The concert poster contained the complete lineup and time of appearance. Newspaper articles a day or two prior to the concert repeated the highlights of the poster's schedule with a few changes. Newspaper reports after the performances confirm that all bands on Sunday which were scheduled played (\\"although the time slots for them were juggled considerably\\") and confirm most of Monday's lineup with a few order changes. Without any media reports to the contrary, it is assumed that Saturday's schedule took place as planned. Lesser known bands were scheduled to play an hour apart, better known bands were given an hour and 15 minutes, and Jefferson Airplane was booked for a two-hour concert. The demands of the crowd for encores quickly put the festival off schedule, pushing performance times later and later as the day wore on, although the double stage did allow a band to get on stage before the preceding band was finished, drastically reducing the intermission between bands. Saturday, August 30, 1969 # Local bands starting playing at 6:00pm until the \\"official\\" free concert began at 8:00pm. # White Fox # Snow Rabbit # Deacon John and the Electric Soul Train # Whizbang # Axis # Tyrannosaurus Rex # It's a Beautiful Day Sunday, August 31, 1969 # Flower Power # Snow Rabbit # Spiral Starecase # Oliver # Smyth # The Youngbloods # It's a Beautiful Day # Country Joe and the Fish # The Byrds # Canned Heat - A fireworks display was scheduled after this act. # Iron Butterfly # Janis Joplin # Santana Sweetwater and White Clover were supposed to play, but their performances were canceled due to the late hour; the scheduled jam session was probably also canceled. Doug Kershaw from Louisiana played as well but is not mentioned here. He had a big hit: Louisiana Man. Monday, September 1, 1969 While it is likely that Sweetwater and White Clover were moved to Monday's lineup, there was no mention of it in local media reports. (At the very least, Sweetwater's status as a Woodstock band makes it unlikely that they were not given another performance slot.) # Potliquor - A flower drop was supposed to take place during the Potliquor performance, but the plane missed its target and dropped the flowers onto nearby fields instead of on the crowd; additionally, the flowers fell in globs instead of \\"floating gently down among the flower children.\\" # Axis # Oliver # Cat Mother and the All Night Newsboys # Santana # Chicago (Transit Authority) - Several newspaper articles referred to this group as Chicago Transit Authority. The concert poster listed them as it is listed here, with Transit Authority in parentheses. This would suggest that the band had already changed its name but were still commonly known as CTA. # It's a Beautiful Day # Tyrannosaurus Rex # The Youngbloods # Lee Michaels # Grateful Dead # Jefferson Airplane # Dr. John VooDoo Show # Giant Jam Session featuring Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Cat Mother, Santana, Chicago, Beautiful Day # Whizbang # Glen McKay and his crew, known as the Headlights, nationally known for their concert light shows, presented a light show Sunday and Monday nights. Several newspapers mentioned that Clearwater Revival (presumably Creedence Clearwater Revival) played, but that is almost certainly incorrect. ==Other Labor Day festivals of 1969== The New Orleans Pop Festival was not the only festival of significance on the Labor Day weekend of 1969. Three were held on that weekend in the U.S. and one in Great Britain: * Sky River Rock Festival (August 30 – September 1, 1969), held in Tenino, Washington * Texas International Pop Festival (August 30 – September 1, 1969), held at the newly opened Dallas International Motor Speedway in Lewisville, Texas * Isle of Wight Festival (August 29–31, 1969), held at Wootton, England on the Isle of Wight ==The music== According to reports from the New Orleans Times-Picayune, the first of the Sunday performances were \\"largely disappointing\\", with the performance by Oliver described as \\"particularly inept\\". However, the \\"Youngbloods awakened a lethargic crowd... with a solid performance.\\" It's a Beautiful Day was called \\"one of the outstanding acts of the entire festival\\" and received calls for the first encore of the day. Country Joe and the Fish were said to be \\"moving\\", while the Byrds gave a professional performance but \\"their music lacked the emotion of the other groups\\". Canned Heat, who followed The Byrds, was described as \\"the hit of the night\\", bringing the spectators to their feet, and yet perhaps topped by Iron Butterfly who \\"definitely provided the highlight of the night's entertainment\\". Janis Joplin followed \\"with obvious emotion\\" and yet her performance was \\"anti-climactic after Canned Heat and Iron Butterfly\\". On Monday, It's a Beautiful Day gave \\"another fine performance\\". ==Groups of note== Several groups which appeared at the New Orleans Pop Festival also appeared at the two other major U.S. pop festivals being held on the same holiday weekend. Those groups were: * Also performing at the Sky River Rock Festival: * # Country Joe and the Fish # The Youngbloods * Also performing at the Texas International Pop Festival: * # Canned Heat # Chicago Transit Authority # Janis Joplin # Santana # Sweetwater Seven groups also appeared at Woodstock, two weeks previous, on August 15–18, 1969: # Sweetwater # Janis Joplin # Santana # Jefferson Airplane # Grateful Dead # Country Joe and the Fish # Canned Heat While most groups were already nationally known, at least one group was able to parlay its performance at the New Orleans Pop Festival into a record contract. The local group, Potliquor, caught the eyes of several record labels, eventually signing a record contract with Janus Records. ==See also== *List of historic rock festivals ==References== Category:Concerts in the United States Category:Hippie movement Category:Counterculture festivals Category:1969 in American music Category:Pop music festivals in the United States Category:Music festivals established in 1969 Category:1969 music festivals ","title":"New Orleans Pop Festival"},{"id":"46389647","text":"Tomasso Sandrini (1575-1631) was an Italian painter, active in painting quadratura in Northern Italy, including his native Brescia.

This two-story commercial building, created in 1922, was an extensive remodel of the Hotel Playa, a hotel opened in 1906 on the same site. The building served at the headquarters of the Dickinson & Gillespie Real Estate Company, a Minneapolis, Minnesota based partnership which relocated here in 1922, and was directed by Fritz Bernard Burns, the General Manager. The company was responsible for the development of Palisades del Rey, Surfridge and the Del Rey Hills. Part of the Del Rey Hills, today a part of the town of Westchester, was developed as the campus of Loyola University, now Loyola Marymount University. The land for the campus was donated by Harry Culver, Father of nearby Culver City, California, and the Blankenthorn Syndicate, controlled by Fritz Burns, and his partners at Dickinson and Gillespie. The building has been designated as a California Historical Monument. It was designed (re-designed) by architectural firm of Roth & Parker with a later interior renovation by Parkinson & Parkinson. The exterior is stucco with terra cotta. The Vista del Mar elevation is divided into five bays with a centered entrance consisting of large arched opening surrounded by a cast concrete frame with a lintel and swag decorative details. The opening is flanked by three arched storefronts with awnings on one section and three rectangular shaped storefronts on the adjacent section. Two of the upper floor bays are inset, creating two balconied sections topped by a sloping tile roof supported by bracketed wood columns and three tower-like bays flush with the ground floor elevation. Each tower-like bay contains paired narrow ogee-shaped windows with rounded apex surrounded by decorative terra-cotta detailing. The smaller Culver Boulevard elevation continues the same design decorative treatment, having three arched storefronts with awnings, centered balconied area, and two tower-like bays with decorative windows. Significant interiors include a vestibule space with decorative molding, and some storefronts with original interior elements. Dickinson and Gillespie suffered devastating losses as a result of the collapse of the United States economy in 1929, and shortly thereafter vacated the premises. Over the years, the building was occupied by doctors, dentists, a hardware store operation, a surf shop and a bicycle rental stand, just to name a few. Another notable owner and occupant was graphic designer Robert Miles Runyan who occupied the building in the 1970s-80s. Runyan is recognized for revolutionizing the format and design of corporate reports and designing the “Stars in Motion” logo for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.

It was released by Epic Records on April 27, 2015, as the only single from the album. Carey wrote the song in collaboration with Eric Hudson, Priscilla Renea, Taylor Parks and Ilsey Juber. Carey and Hudson also produced the track. It is an R&B; song; the lyrics are about Carey putting herself first and emancipation. However, many critics likened the content to the singer's separation from her then-husband, entertainer Nick Cannon. Critical response to \\"Infinity\\" was positive, with Carey's vocals and humorous songwriting praised. Particular emphasis was placed on the reference to Fritos. In the United States, the song reached number eighty-two on the Billboard Hot 100, and charted on several R&B; component charts. In Europe, it peaked at number twenty-seven on the UK R&B; Chart, and made the top twenty in Spain and top thirty in Hungary. Carey performed a medley of her 1990 debut single \\"Vision of Love\\" with \\"Infinity\\" at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, Live! with Kelly and Michael and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. ==Background== \\"Infinity\\" is the only new recording to be included on Carey's third greatest hits album, #1 to Infinity (2015). It was written and produced by Carey and Eric Hudson, with additional songwriting from Priscilla Renea, Taylor Parks and Ilsey Juber. Carey unveiled the single's artwork on April 24, 2015, via music identification service Shazam. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote that Carey exudes \\"overpowering glamor\\" and \\"looks typically ravishing in a cleavage-exposing, black ensemble, which she accentuates with huge diamond earrings and fabulous windswept hair.\\" ==Composition and lyrical interpretation== Several critics felt that \\"Infinity\\" is about Carey's estranged husband, Nick Cannon. \\"Infinity\\" is a mid-tempo R&B; ballad that lasts for a duration of four minutes. Carey belts the lines, \\"Close the door, lose the key, leave my heart on the mat for me. I was yours eternally, there's an end to infinity\\", while the songs hook consists of the singer \\"breathily cooing\\" the title repeatedly in a descending vocal run. Accompanied by an orchestral synth, string and brass instrumental, Alex Camp of Slant Magazine described \\"Infinity\\" as a \\"welcome throwback to Mariah's early ballads\\". Andrew Unterberger of Spin likened the intro to the work of Just Blaze, and noted that she finishes the song with a whistle note. According to its lyrics, Carey is putting herself first in order to emancipate herself. As described by Wass, \\"Infinity\\" is \\"distinctly unromantic\\" and \\"a kiss-off anthem\\", writing that it sits somewhere in between two of Carey's previous singles, \\"Obsessed\\" (2009) and \\"You're Mine (Eternal)\\" (2014). According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is written in the key of D major with a tempo of 67 beats per minute. The song is written in cut time and follows a chord progression of Gmaj7 – D/F – Em7, with Carey's vocals spanning three octaves, from D3 to D6. The lyric \\"Boy, you actin’ so corny like Fritos\\" generated a positive response from both critics and fans alike, with MTV News reporting that fans were \\"freaking\\" over it. Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as \\"hilarious\\", while Camp likened it to a form of product placement. Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus, \\"Close the door/Lose the key/Leave my heart on the mat for me/I was yours eternally/There's an end to infinity\\" and one of the verses, \\"Name hold weight like kilos/Boy you actin' so corny like Fritos/Wouldn't have none of that without me, though/Ain't none of my business, it's tea though/Outta ammo, gotta reload/If life was a game you're a free throw/It's nothing that you don't already know,\\" noting that the former is \\"almost sweet\\" compared to the latter. The lyrics aroused suspicion amongst critics that it was referring to Carey's separation from her second husband, Nick Cannon. Daniel D’Addario of Time called \\"Infinity\\" a \\"kiss-off track\\" directed at Cannon, while Camp wrote that the song will be \\"better remembered\\" for its lyrical content aimed at Cannon. A reviewer for Billboard wrote that Carey was possibly \\"returning to form as the queen of post- heartbreak empowerment\\", but speculated that the lyrics were most likely about Cannon. Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that \\"Infinity\\" is more of a \\"kiss- off\\" than \\"come-on\\" track. Unterberger documented that fans would \\"prognosticate\\" over whether or not the lyrics pertained to her marriage to Cannon. Emilee Linder for MTV News noticed that Carey appeared to refer to their separation and ongoing co-parenting of their twins, Moroccan and Monroe, in the line \\"Ain't no being friends/ Ain’t no false pretense/ Ain’t no make amends/ Ain’t no come agains/ That’s the story, ain’t no happy ends.\\" However, Carey has denied that the lyrics are in any way related to her personal life. When Liz Hernandez of Access Hollywood asked if the lyrics were about her relationship with Cannon, Carey responded by saying that it is about putting herself first, and that even if the lyrics were directed at Cannon, she would not publicly confirm it: ==Music video== The song's accompanying music video was directed by Brett Ratner, a longtime friend of Carey's, and premiered on June 2, 2015. Clips of Carey performing \\"Infinity\\" at her Las Vegas residency are intercut with cameos by Tyson Beckford and Jussie Smollett. ==Remix== On July 30, 2015, Carey posted a photo on her Instagram account accompanied by Hudson, French Montana and Justin Bieber at recording studio Record Plant in Hollywood. It was reported by TMZ that Carey, Hudson and Montana were working on a remix to \\"Infinity\\", and that Bieber \\"decided to pop in\\". They played the remix to Bieber, who after expressing his admiration for Carey and the song, decided to contribute some vocals to it. With Carey only performing the hook to the original version of \\"Infinity\\", the theme of the remix is that she rejects each of the three featured artists proposals. The song begins with a \\"laconic rap\\" by Montana, followed by Carey singing the hook over a \\"synth- laden chorus\\", which has a heavier instrumental and bass compared to the original version. Bieber begins his verse approximately one minute and forty- five seconds in, singing the new lyrics. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing \\"Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny.\\" It is the second time that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe. ==Critical reception== \\"Infinity\\" garnered a positive response from critics, many of whom complimented its throwback feel, as well as Carey's vocals and songwriting. Billboard was complimentary of the song, writing \\"The throwback-flavored track is a soaring break-up track, complete with sassy lines that shut down the guy she's singing about.\\" Mansfield and Wass both complimented the non sequitur lyrical couplet of \\"Boy you so corny like Fritos\\" and \\"If life was a game you’re a free throw\\". Mansfield further noted that although \\"Infinity\\" does not \\"recapture the glory\\" of past singles \\"Dreamlover\\" (1993) and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" (1995), \\"it sure gets the sound right,\\" while Wass wrote that \\"Infinity\\" showcases Carey's vocal range and \\"knack for writing hilarious one-liners.\\" D’Addario echoed Wass's sentiment regarding the couplet, writing that the song is \\"full of Carey’s trademark askew wit\\". Unterberger concluded his review by writing that no other singer could perform \\"Infinity\\" as well as Carey. Although Camp wrote that \\"Infinity\\" delivers everything listeners have come to grow accustomed to hearing from Carey, such as whistle notes and \\"sudden shifts from chest to head voice\\", she disapproved of the drawn out \\"non-hook\\". She further criticised the song's melodic structure, writing that it appeared to cover up Carey's \\"ailing voice\\". Despite praising the song, several critics wrote that \\"Infinity\\" was unlikely to become her nineteenth number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Chart performance== In the United States, \\"Infinity\\" peaked at number eighty-two on the Billboard Hot 100, with first week sales figures of 26,000 downloads and 1.8 million streams. Her forty-seventh entry on the Hot 100 in twenty-five years following her debut in 1990, it places her ninth amongst artists with the most entries. It further peaked at number forty-five on the Digital Songs chart, number twenty-two on the Adult R&B; songs chart, number eleven on both the R&B; Songs and the R&B;/Hip-Hop Digital Songs charts, and number twenty- eight on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number twenty-seven on the UK R&B; Chart, but missed the top one- hundred on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at one-hundred and fifty-four for only one week. In Europe, \\"Infinity\\" made the top twenty in Spain and the top thirty in Hungary. Elsewhere, the song peaked at number fifty-two in Sweden and eighty-five in France. The song originally peaked at number sixty-four, and later at forty-three, in Japan. ==Promotion== Carey performed a medley of her 1990 debut single \\"Vision of Love\\" with \\"Infinity\\" as part of its promotion, the first time being at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards on May 17, 2015, her first appearance at the awards show in seventeen years. A video tribute to the singer was shown prior to the singer entering the stage, who was wearing a \\"sheer and glittery\\" dress. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that it was an \\"Octave-leaping\\" performance and one of the most memorable of the night. However Carey's vocals, despite confirming that she had been suffering from bronchitis prior to the performance, garnered a mixed reaction from users on Twitter. D’Addario wrote that she sang \\"Vision of Love\\" with \\"evident confidence\\", but noted that the key had been lowered. The next day, Carey repeated the medley on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The singer performed the medley on Live! with Kelly and Michael on May 22, 2015, during their week-long Disney World take-over. On a platform above the road on Main Street, U.S.A., Carey wore a magenta dress inspired by the one which Disney character Aurora wears in Sleeping Beauty (1959). \\"Infinity\\" is included as the closing song on the set-list of her third headlining residency Mariah Carey Number 1's at The Colosseum at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas. ==Credits and personnel== The following credits were adapted from the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Epic Records.

The home field of the Utah State Aggies of the Mountain West Conference, it opened in 1968 as \\" and currently has a seating capacity Its field has a traditional north-south alignment, and sits at an elevation of above sea level. The playing surface was natural grass through 2003, and is currently AstroTurf GameDay Grass. Previously named for Dick Romney, USU's all-time most successful football coach and former athletics director, Romney Stadium was officially dedicated on in the stadium came a season earlier in 1968, when USU defeated New Mexico State ==History== Prior to the construction of the first Romney Stadium, intercollegiate and intramural competition took place on a makeshift field east of Old Main. This area, which would eventually become the Quad, served the needs of the college’s football and track teams until 1913. According to historian A.J. Simmonds, it “was the responsibility of players to pick the rocks off the playing field before matches.” Student Phebe Nebeker recalled the field’s appearance after accompanying her future husband, Elmer G. Peterson, to a contest in 1903. “It wasn’t anything like what we think of today as a football stadium. It was merely a somewhat flat area - with a little grass here and there - that was very muddy when it rained and very hard when it didn’t. One small set of bleachers had been erected near the southeast corner of Old Main, but most of the patrons had to stand or sit on patches of grass along the playing field.” In 1913, College contests began taking place at Adams Field, located west of Old Main Hill on the east side of the present Adams Park. Although Adams Field represented an improvement, it did not provide the type of facility which could launch the Aggies into competitive intercollegiate play. The sparse facilities became more obvious after the College employed Coach Lowell “Dick” Romney in 1918, and Aggie football began experiencing considerable success. First Romney Stadium The original Romney Stadium was built in 1927 on the grounds where the Health, Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) building now stands. That facility was dedicated in 1927 on October 8, in recognition of Coach E.L. \\"Dick\\" Romney's lasting contributions to Utah State football. It served as Utah State’s home for 41 seasons (1927–67); USU played its final game in the old complex on November 11, 1967, defeating Montana 20–14. Second Romney Stadium The stadium retained the Romney name as it was relocated farther north on Utah State's campus to its present location. The first game in the current location was played on Sept. 14, 1968 when the Aggies defeated New Mexico State, 28–12, and the facility was officially dedicated on Sept. 27, 1969. The stadium was financed by a student body which believed in athletics to the extent of underwriting a special bonding assessment for both Romney Stadium and the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, which serves as home for Utah State’s basketball, gymnastics and volleyball teams. Thanks to a massive volunteer effort in 1980, 10,000 seats were added to the southern bowl which brought the capacity of the stadium to 30,257. Prior to the 1997 season, approximately 4,000 chair back seats replaced wooden bleachers on the west side of the stadium. Ahead of the 1999 season, new scoreboards were added at each end of the stadium and additional bleacher seats were installed as well. New aluminum bleachers replaced wooden bleachers on the lower sections of the east side of the stadium in 2001. In 2003, that project expanded to the upper sections. Changes in the space allocated for a \\"seat\\" by the NCAA reduced stadium capacity to 25,513. In the summer of 2004, the bent bluegrass field was replaced with a state of the art synthetic turf by SprinTurf. Prior to the 2005 season a new south end entrance, improved concession stands and restroom facilities as well as a widened concourse on the east side of the stadium were completed. 2013 after upgrades to the turf and introduction of new logos, with Laub Athletics- Academics Complex in north end zone. Merlin Olsen Field On December 5, 2009, USU announced that the field at Maverik Stadium (then Romney Stadium) would be named Merlin Olsen Field in honor of Pro and College Football Hall of Fame member and former Aggie Merlin Olsen. Following Olsen's death in March 2010, Utah State dedicated a statue in his honor in a ceremony held on October 23, 2010. The bronze statue, created by Utah sculptor Blair Buswell, depicts Olsen during his college playing days at USU - in full uniform and pads, with his helmet under his arm - and stands outside the south entrance of Maverik Stadium. Following the unveiling of new Utah State athletics logos and prior to the home opener of the 2012 football season, the playing surface on Merlin Olsen Field was replaced. The SprinTurf, which was installed in 2004, was replaced by AstroTurf GameDay Grass 3D60 Extreme and the new athletic logo replaced the old at center field. The new end zones are navy blue with the “Utah State” word mark in the south end zone and the “Aggies” word mark in the north end zone, bookended by the new bull logo. Renaming Romney Stadium On April 11, 2015, the stadium was officially renamed Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium in conjunction with a corporate sponsorship from the Intermountain West-located chain of convenience stores. The partnership was hailed as a catalyst for the stadium renovation which was said would commence immediately with the demolition of the west side press box and a section of the west side seating. The partnership with Utah State and Maverik is a multi- year agreement, which includes top-tier advertising rights and prominent signage on the exterior and interior of the stadium. Additionally, the venue features a Maverik concession outlet that sells a number of Maverik proprietary food products. Regarding the renaming, Coach Dick Romney's grandson, Richard Romney, stated that renaming Romney Stadium was bittersweet, but that the Romney family realizes that to be competitive and relevant in today's sports world, the team needs to have strong financial backing. Richard also stated, \\"What Grandpa accomplished at Utah State will never be duplicated in today's society. We know his name will remain prominent and continue to have a strong legacy at Utah State. His story will not be forgotten.\\" Romney served Utah State for 41 years, coaching 4 sports and serving as athletic director. He was inducted into the Collegiate Football Hall of Fame in 1954. (His personal athletic accomplishments included playing on the AAU Championship Basketball Team In 1916, then scoring a touchdown in the 1918 Rose Bowl.) ==Changes to the stadium complex== Stadium renovation In December 2014, a $1 million donation toward stadium renovation was announced. The donation was made by Utah State University alumnus and former President of Nike, Inc. Charlie Denson and his wife Trina. On the west side of the stadium, a new four-story premium seating and press box structure was built to include a state-of-the-art media and game operations area, 24 luxury suites, 24 loge boxes, over 700 covered club seats and a premium club area that also hosts a student-athlete training table. Major concourse work included significantly increased restrooms, upgraded concessions, and an enlarged concourse for better pedestrian traffic flow. Improvements on the east included additional seating and restroom facilities. The renovation also saw new video boards added to both ends of the stadium, along with a new public address system. These renovations were debuted for the home opener against Weber State on September 1, 2016. Additional expansion of Maverik Stadium's seating capacity is also planned for the future. Jim and Carol Laub Athletics-Academics Complex Laub Athletics-Academics Complex Immediately after the 2006 season, the old north end zone complex was torn down and replaced with a three-story, facility called The Jim & Carol Laub Athletics-Academics Complex. It was completed in 2008. The facility houses the Dale Mildenberger Sports Medicine Complex, the Dr. John Worley Sports Medicine Research Center, the Steve Mothersell Hall of Fame, equipment room, locker rooms, coaches offices, meeting rooms, luxury suites and a student-athlete academic center. Strength and conditioning center On May 26, 2012, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the construction of a new strength and conditioning center. The facility was made possible by the largest single gift from an anonymous donor in the history of Aggie Athletics. The $6.4 million, strength and conditioning center opened in late July 2013. It features areas for weight training, cardiovascular workouts and speed and agility training, as well as offices for staff. Built on existing university property at the northwest corner of Romney Stadium, the state-of-the-art multi-level facility alleviates overcrowding in the former strength and conditioning center and will accommodate almost 400 athletes from 16 sports programs. West Stadium Center at Maverik Stadium On September 1, 2016, the Aggies revealed the renovations of a new press box and luxury suite complex at Maverik Stadium. The state-of-the-art facility was made possible largely by private donations. The total cost of the renovations was $36 million. It features 20 plus suites with 640 club seats. Two new scoreboards with enlarged video screens and an upgraded sound system were also included as part of the project. The stadium's capacity was temporarily reduced to 22,059 for the 2015 season as work progressed. ==Team history at Maverik Stadium== Dick Romney guided the Aggies to four conference championships, compiling a 128–91–16 record (.579) in 29 seasons (1919–48). Over the past 33 seasons, Utah State has compiled a 94–69 mark (.577) winning percentage) in the current Maverik Stadium. Only nine times in the 33-year history of the stadium has Utah State experienced a losing record at home. Utah State’s largest crowd to witness a game in Maverik Stadium was 33,119 (including standing room) in a 45–17 loss to BYU on October 4, 1996.NCAAFootball.com page on Romney Stadium The largest crowd to watch a high school football game in Utah's history occurred at Romney Stadium. The 1987 3A state championship game was moved from Salt Lake City's Rice Stadium to accommodate the all-Cache Valley match-up of Mountain Crest and Sky View. Mountain Crest won 9–7 before 19,887 spectators. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums ==References *Utah State University Athletics - Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium Category:College football venues Category:Utah State Aggies football Category:Sports venues in Cache County, Utah Category:American football venues in Utah Category:Sports venues completed in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in Utah ","title":"Maverik Stadium"},{"id":"46389871","text":"Ma Chaoqun () was a former municipal water works executive from the city of Qinhuangdao, in northeastern China. He underwent investigation for corruption beginning in 2014. He gained nationwide notoriety after investigators found over 120 million yuan (~$17 million) worth of cash in his home. ==Career== Ma was born in Haigang District in Qinghuangdao, the eldest of four children. In 1985, Ma graduated from a local polytechnic college and entered the municipal water works department, where he worked as a technician in charge of furnace maintenance. He later began taking on administrative roles. In 1997, Ma was named head of the water works division of Beidaihe, a seaside resort popular with leaders of the Communist Party. In 2005, the municipal water works was re-organized into a corporation, which signed a 25-year contract with the city to maintain the water supply. Ma became its vice president in charge of its Beidaihe branch.专案组向“亿元水官”出示抓捕文书 被其一把抢过撕掉, Ifeng, November 19, 2014 In November 2010, the operations of the Beidaihe branch of the company was separated from that of Qinhuangdao. In the next year, the state-owned Beidaihe Water Works Corporation was founded with Ma Chaoqun as its chief executive. The company served Beidaihe as well as neighbouring counties. More importantly, the company was charged with providing water to various state and party agencies stationed in the area, including to Communist leaders during their annual summer retreat in Beidaihe. In 2012, Ma was given recognition by the province for his high performance during the summer months, named a \\"Model Labourer\\" by the city of Qinhuangdao.北戴河供水总公司成立，河北新闻网， 2011-02-09 In January 2014, Ma was reported by people with links to a state-owned company in Beijing as having solicited bribes worth millions of yuan from a local hotel. On February 12, 2014, Ma was detained for a corruption investigation. His younger brother Ma Zhongqun was detained on the same day, and his younger sister Ma Qingru was arrested a month later. On November 12, 2014, the Hebei provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDI) released findings of its investigation, accusing Ma of embezzlement, bribery, and illegally moving public resources. He was arrested and faced a raft of criminal charges. The Ma case gained notoriety for the astronomical value of alleged bribes. The Hebei CDI was said to have discovered over 120 million yuan ($19.3 million) worth of cash in Ma's home. Also unearthed was 37 kilograms of gold and 68 real estate certificates of ownership. To carry out Ma's arrest, the police mobilized the city's special operations unit, as Ma was believed to have ties with local organized crime. That Ma, merely a division-level () official (i.e., rank equivalent to that of a county governor) had such a large sum stored up in his home shocked the public. Ma's mother Zhang Guiying denied that her son was corrupt, claiming that the assets were the result of years of hard work by her husband who operated a coal mine, asserting that her son was being blackmailed. Chinese media has also reported connections between Ma Chaoqun and his so-called \\"godfather\\", who was suspected to be a high-level official from Beijing. It has been suggested that the processing of the case has faced interference from the authorities as increasing its scope may have dragged out an 'untouchable tiger'. Ma is married to Zhang Lihuan. They had one son. Ma's name, \\"Chaoqun\\", means \\"soars above the rest.\\" ==References== Category:People from Qinhuangdao Category:1967 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ma Chaoqun"},{"id":"46389877","text":"Ian Davison is a British white supremacist and convicted terrorist.

He won the Premio Tevere as a two-year-old and the Valdoe Stakes as a three-year-old, but reached his peak in 1985 when he won the Premio Presidente della Repubblica before recording a 33/1 upset win over a very strong field in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. He was later exported to race in the United States but failed to reproduce his European form, winning one minor race from fourteen attempts. He later became a successful breeding stallion, making his biggest impact as a sire of chasers and hurdlers. ==Background== Bob Back was a big brown with a faint white star horse bred in Kentucky by Joseph Allen. He was sired by Roberto, an American- bred horse who won the Epsom Derby and the inaugural Benson and Hedges Gold Cup as a three-year-old in 1972. At stud, Roberto sired many important winners including Sunshine Forever, Touching Wood, Real Shadai, At Talaq, Lear Fan, Kris S. and Dynaformer. Bob Back's dam Toter Back was a daughter of the 1961 Kentucky Derby winner Carry Back and a granddaughter of the mare Roman Zephyr who also produced Roman Brother. As a yearling, Bob Back was sold for $150,000 at the 1982 Fasig-Tipton sale and entered the ownership of Antonio Balzarini. He was sent to Europe and entered training with Michael Jarvis at his Pegasus House table in Newmarket, Suffolk. ==Racing career== 1983: two-year-old season After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut, Bob Back started third favourite for a twenty-eight-runner maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse in October and won by a length from Commanche Run. He was then sent to Italy and moved up in class for the Group Two Premio Tevere over 1600 metres and won by two and a half lengths from Life On Mars. 1984: three-year-old season As a three-year-old in 1984, Bob Back won once from ten races. On his seasonal debut he finished third to Trojan Fen in the Feilden Stakes at Newmarket in April and was then sent back to Italy to contest the Derby Italiano and was beaten a short-head into second place by Welnor with At Talaq in third. After being unplaced in his next three starts Bob Back started at odds of 8/1 for the Listed Valdoe Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in September. Ridden by Bruce Raymond he took the lead hal a mile from the finish and won by five lengths from Kalim. He went on to finish third to Estrapade in La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte in September and third to Gay Lemur in the St Simon Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in October. 1985: four-year-old season On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Bob Back finished third behind Elegant Air and Parliament in the Group Three Westbury Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in April. After finishing unplaced in his next race he was sent to Italy for the Group One Premio Presidente della Repubblica over 2000 metres at Capannelle Racecourse in May and won by two and a half lengths from Reco. On his return to England Bob Back was one of four horses to contest the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot on 18 June. The race was widely regarded as a match between the classic winners Pebbles and Commanche Run with Bob Back starting a 33/1 outsider. The only other runner was Costly Lesson, who started at 66/1. Bruce Raymond restrained the colt at the back of the field as Commanche Run set the pace before moving up on the outside in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and recorded an upset victory, beating Pebbles and Commanche Run by one and a half lengths and a short head. Excuses were given for the beaten horses: Pebbles was reported to be in season whilst Commanche Run's connections claimed that he was unsuited by the muddling pace. Bob Back went on to finish third behind Pebbles and Rainbow Quest in the Eclipse Stakes, but ran poorly when unplaced behind Commanche Run in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. On his final European start he finished second, three lengths behind Commanche Run in the Phoenix Champion Stakes. Bob Back was then sold to Bruce McNall and sent to the United States where he was trained by Angel Penna Sr.. On his American debut he produced a good performance when finishing second by a neck to the gelding Win in the Man o' War Stakes at Belmont Park. In his two remaining races Bob Back finished unplaced in the Breeders' Cup Turf and the Bay Meadows Handicap. Later career Although it was reported that he would be retired to stud at the end of the 1985 season, Bob Back continued to race for two more years in North America in the ownership of Allen Paulson. He made no impact in 1986, finishing unplaced in all six of his races. He showed slightly better form as a six-year-old, winning an allowance race at Hollywood Park Racetrack in April on the fourth of his five appearances. ==Assessment== In the British Free Handicap for 1983, Bob Back was given a weight of 117 pounds, sixteen pounds behind the top-rated two-year-old El Gran Senor. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 110, twenty-one pounds behind El Gran Senor. In their annual Racehorses of 1983, Timeform described him as \\"likely to make [a] smart 3-y-o\\". In 1984 Timeform rated him on 117, nineteen pounds below their top-rated horse El Gran Senor, whilst the official British handicapper rated him twenty pounds inferior to the Irish colt. Bob Back achieved a peak Timeform rating of 124 in 1985, eleven pounds behind the Horse of the Year Pebbles. The official International Classification rated him on 83, making him the fourteenth-best older horse in Europe. ==Stud career== On his retirement from racing, Bob Back became a breeding stallion in Ireland, based at the Baroda Stud in County Kildare and the Ballylinch Stud in County Kilkenny before being moved to the Burgage Stud in County Carlow. The best of his flat runners was Bob's Return, who won the St Leger Stakes in 1993 although he also sired the Furstenberg-Rennen winner Big Bad Bob and the Premio Chiusura winner Inner City. He was more successful with his National Hunt runners siring major winner including Bobs Worth, Back In Front, Bacchanal, Burton Port (Mildmay Novices' Chase), Boston Bob (Melling Chase) and Thisthatandtother (Festival Trophy). He is also the damsire of the Grand National winners Synchronised and Many Clouds. He was retired from stud duty in 2008 and died in January 2011 at the age of thirty. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1981 racehorse births Category:2011 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bob Back"},{"id":"46390055","text":"Mai Kivelä in 2014 Mai Kivelä (born December 20, 1982) is a Finnish human rights activist, feminist, and member of Parliament.

This method, which is controversial, has mainly found application in German-speaking countries. == Life == Born the son of an optician, Haase underwent formal training to be a clockmaker and an optician, and became a Meister-optician in 1951. From 1953 onwards he held a teaching position at the ' (SFOF) in Berlin. With an acute interest in binocular vision, Haase developed novel binocular vision testing methods based on the Turville infinity balance technique which had become known in Britain. He developed an apparatus for vision testing, which has since been built and sold by the Carl Zeiss company under the name Polatest. == MKH method == Haase developed a method which is intended to improve binocular vision called the MKH method (short for: Mess- und Korrektionsmethodik nach H.-J. Haase), which has become known in German-speaking countries in particular. The method consists in a measurement of an alleged angular misalignment (referred to as associated phoria or hidden strabismus, also called \\"\\" in German language) that is different from heterotropia or heterophoria, and involves the use of prisms for its correction. In the MKH method, this alleged misalignment is assessed by the Polatest apparatus and subsequently the patient is instructed to use prism glasses in daily life to correct for the alleged misalignment, with the prism glasses made according to the Polatest results. The MKH method claims to reduce eye strain-related symptoms. It has found some application in German-speaking countries and claims to achieve unimpaired binocular vision, With abstract in English however it has received little scientific recognition and is not accepted by mainstream medical practice, either internationally or in Germany. The method does not appear to show better results than conventional spectacle prescriptions, and the practice of MKH has been criticized as contravening the rule to first do no harm. The German association of ophthalmologists ( (BVA)) issued a statement warning that the use of the MKH method could in fact lead to use of prisms of increasing strength, ultimately requiring the patient to undergo strabismus surgery that would have otherwise been unnecessary. The vision therapy approach that is widespread in the U.S. and which has led to recover stereopsis in a number of persons, most notably Susan R. Barry, is diametrically opposed to the use of prisms in the manner that is advocated in the MKH method. In particular, Frederick W. Brock spoke against the use of an amblyoscope during training, because in his view the patient needed to take the correct binocular posture (aiming the two eyes such that they simultaneously look at the same target in space) when fusing, otherwise the training would not be likely to succeed. In any case, tentative studies have been undertaken whether some synergy can be found between the U.S. approach to vision therapy and the German approach of MKH. == Awards == Haase received the following awards: * Deutscher Preis für Optometrie (DGO) * Simon-Plössl-Medal (Austria) * Honorary award in gold of the Zentralverband der Augenoptiker The International Association for Binocular Vision (Internationale Vereinigung für Binokulares Sehen, IVBS) was created to further advance his MKH method.

Hodges was issued, Bush said that \\"irrespective of\\" the outcome \\"we need to be stalwart supporters of traditional marriage.\\" Bush also stated \\"To imagine how we are going to succeed in our country unless we have committed family life, committed child-centered family system, is hard to imagine.\\" After the Supreme Court's June 2015 ruling in Obergefell that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Bush issued a statement in which he said that the decision was wrong, saying: \\"Guided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage. I believe the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision.\\"Nick Corasaniti, Supreme Court Rules on Gay Marriage – Highlights: Jeb Bush Releases Statement: 'I Believe in Traditional Marriage', New York Times (June 26, 2015). However, Bush also said in a statement that he does not support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to allow states to ban same-sex marriage.Alex Leary, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio disagree with Scott Walker's call for Constitutional amendment on gay marriage , Tampa Bay Times (June 26, 2015).

In January 2015, Bush said: \\"Previously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision.\\" In July 2015, Bush said he supported lifting the military's ban on allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military, so long as \\"the military's comfortable with this\\" and it did not impact morale.Jon Ward, Jeb Bush supports Pentagon move to allow transgender military service, Yahoo Politics (July 16, 2016). In a 1994 op-ed written while Bush was making his first campaign for governor, Bush argued that LGBT persons should not have the same protections accorded to persons based on race or religion, writing \\"[should] sodomy be elevated to the same constitutional status as race and religion? My answer is No.\\"Andrew Kaczynski & Ruby Cramer, Jeb Bush In ‘94: “Sodomy” Shouldn’t Be Given Same Protections As Race, Religion, BuzzFeed (January 5, 2015). In 2015, a Bush spokesperson said that the op-ed \\"does not reflect Governor Bush's views now, nor would he use this terminology today.\\" In his 1995 book, Profiles in Character, Bush described the \\"gay rights movement,\\" \\"feminist movement,\\" and \\"black empowerment movement\\" as \\"modern victim movements\\" which \\"have attempted to get people to view themselves as part of a smaller group deserving of something from society.\\" Bush said that such movements are, \\"a major deviation from the society envisioned by Martin Luther King, who would have had people judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin — or sexual preference or gender or ethnicity.\\"Bush, Jeb and Yablonski, B. Profiles in Character, pp. 59-60 (1995). Gun control Overall, Bush is for expanding gun owners' rights. As governor of Florida, Bush signed into law several bills \\"extending new rights to gun owners, including those to expand protections for people permitted to carry concealed firearms.\\"Patrick O'Connor & Beth Reinhard, Jeb Bush Leans on His Gun-Rights Bona Fides Wall Street Journal (April 9, 2015). One such measure signed by Bush allows reciprocity for out- of-state permit holders. The number of concealed-carry permit-holders in Florida went up during Bush's tenure, and Florida has more concealed carry license holders than any other state, partially as a result of the new laws, a fact which Bush has touted while campaigning in 2015.Amy Sherman, Which state has the most gun permits?, Politifact (April 15, 2015). In 2005, as governor, Bush signed the \\"stand-your-ground law\\" on the use of deadly force. In 1998, while running for governor, Bush supported a Florida law requiring background checks for firearms purchased at gun shows (such checks are not required by federal law).Benjy Sarlin, Jeb Bush backed background checks at gun shows, MSNBC (April 10, 2015). In June 2015, following the Charleston church killings, he rejected calls for stricter gun control laws, stating that he does not believe tougher gun laws would prevent mass shootings.Kurtis Lee, Jeb Bush rejects post-Charleston calls for stricter gun control laws, Los Angeles Times (June 27, 2010).Associated Press, Gun control not the way to prevent mass killings, Bush says (June 28, 2015). Bush indicated that he continues to support Florida's background-check law but opposes a universal background check law, expressing the belief that background checks should be determined state-by-state. In reference to renewed calls for legislative action after tragic events such as the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon in October 2015, Bush said: \\"I had this challenge as governor because we had — look, stuff happens. There's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and it's not necessarily the right thing to do.\\" When later asked by a reporter to clarify his comment, Bush said \\"Things happen all the time\\" adding, \\"Things. Is that better?\\" The New York Times reported: \\"The inelegant phrase immediately set off a wave of criticism from observers suggesting he was playing down the scourge of gun violence.\\"Jonathan Martin & Matt Flegenheimer, Jeb Bush Is Criticized for Saying 'Stuff Happens' in Reaction to Shootings, New York Times (October 2, 2015). Healthcare Overall healthcare proposals Bush released his healthcare proposals in October 2015.Sean Sullivan, Jeb Bush to pitch replacing Obamacare with tax credits, higher health savings account limits, Washington Post (October 10, 2012)Danielle Kurtzleben, Jeb Bush Has A Plan To Replace Obamacare; Here's What's In It, NPR (October 14, 2015). The proposal would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and eliminate the ACA requirement that health plans provide certain \\"essential health benefits\\" such as maternal healthcare and mental healthcare. Bush proposed new tax credits (adjusted for age, but not for income) for those lacking employer-based health insurance. The plan also called for the repeal of the Cadillac insurance plan tax and its replacement with a similar tax; for allowing some businesses to contribute to their workers' health insurance plans instead of providing coverage themselves; and for capping federal health spending to states and created a block grant-like Medicaid program. The potential effects of Bush's plan-- including its effect on health care costs and the deficit--are uncertain. During the 2015 campaign, Bush has called for replacing the ACA with a \\"market-oriented\\" alternative.Igor Bobic, Jeb Bush: Replace 'Monstrosity' of Obamacare, Huffington Post (March 8, 2015). He has called the current law a \\"monstrosity\\" that is \\"flawed to its core.\\"Bill Glauber, Obamacare is flawed, Jeb Bush says at Milwaukee event, Journal Sentinel (November 4, 2015). Bush has proposed some sort of state- or local-government funded \\"catastrophic coverage\\" system, in which \\"if you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it, ... the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that.\\" After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA in King v. Burwell in June 2015, Bush stated that the decision was \\"not the end of the fight\\" against the law.Jeb: Ruling is 'not the end of the fight' against ObamaCare, The Hill (June 29, 2015). In April 2014, Bush expressed opposition to the ACA provision which bars health insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, stating \\"What if you have a Big Mac for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? You'll get a pre-existing condition pretty soon, because you'll get a heart condition. Should society pay for that behavior? That's a question that the ACA ignores.\\"Scott Novak & Jordan Almazan, Political Profiles: Jeb Bush , The Independent (April 23, 2014). Bush has suggested limiting the definition of \\"pre-existing condition\\" to genetic disorders at birth. In June 2015, Bush said that he opposed requiring employers to provide health-care benefits to employees (the employer mandate) and opposed requiring individuals to carry health insurance (the individual mandate). Medicaid and Medicare In March 2013, Bush expressed opposition to Florida accepting federal funds for Medicaid expansion, as provided for by the ACA (which allocates funds to extend medical coverage to all adults with annual incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level).Jeb Bush opposed to Florida Medicaid expansion, CNN (March 6, 2013). In July 2015, Bush stated that \\"we need to figure out a way to phase out\\" Medicare, the federal program that provides health insurance to Americans once they turn sixty-five years old.Arthur Delaney & Jeffrey Young, Jeb Bush Says We Should Phase Out Medicare, The Huffington Post (July 24, 2015). Bush praised Paul Ryan's proposal to replace Medicare with a voucher system. In response to charges from Democrats that Bush's plans would destroy Medicare, Bush said that he wanted to \\"reform\\" rather than eliminate the program. In April 2015, Bush has suggested that Medicare recipients be required to sign advance directives (outlining end-of-life care instructions) before receiving benefits.Ed O'Keefe, Jeb Bush: Maybe Medicare recipients should be required to sign advance directives, Washington Post (April 1, 2015). While Bush was governor of Florida, he launched a Medicaid overhaul plan intended to reduce the costs of the program to the state.Christopher Flavelle, Jeb Bush and Florida's Medicaid Meltdown, Bloomberg (March 16, 2015). The Bush pilot program (which Bush referred to as \\"empowered care\\") began in 2006 and later expanded to five counties; under the program, private insurers were permitted to manage the Medicaid program and decide which benefits to offer. In 2012, Bush stated that the program was a success that led to better cost control and health outcomes. In 2013, reports showed that plans participating in the Bush reform program \\"ranked below the national Medicaid average on 21 of the 32 quality indicators reported by the state.\\" Women's health In August 2015, at a Southern Baptist Convention event, Bush stated that \\"I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues.\\"Michael Barbaro, Jeb Bush Causes a Stir on Women's Health Issues (August 4, 2015). Several hours later, Bush released a statement saying: \\"With regards to women's health funding broadly, I misspoke, as there are countless community health centers, rural clinics, and other women's health organizations that need to be fully funded. They provide critical services to all, but particularly low-income women who don't have the access they need.\\" Bush also stated that he would have wanted funding for Planned Parenthood to be redirected to other women's health organizations, in line with his record as Governor of Florida; in 2003, Bush redirected $124,000 in funding from Planned Parenthood toward abstinence- only sex education programs. Privatization Bush has called for privatizing some elements of the Veterans Affairs health-care system.Reid J. Epstein, Jeb Bush Calls for Privatizing Elements of Veterans Health Care, Wall Street Journal (April 8, 2015). While Bush was governor of Florida, the State launched an privatization initiative in which three state veterans' nursing homes contracted out their nursing and food services to private companies; one of the facilities suffered from substandard care problems, however, and Bush's successor, Governor Charlie Crist, ended the program.Chris Frates, Bush wants to privatize some veterans' health benefits, but in Florida it didn't go so well, CNN (May 1, 2015). Immigration In 2015, while campaigning for the Republican nomination for president, Bush has called for what he terms \\"a path to earned legal status\\"--but not citizenship--for people in the United States illegally.Matt Wilstein, Jeb Bush Stands By 'Act of Love' Comments, Fires Back at Trump, Mediaite (September 1, 2015).Ashley Killough, Bush confronted by voter over immigration, CNN (September 3, 2015). Bush says that his proposal would allow undocumented workers to secure a provisional work permit, and thus avoid deportation, if they met various requirements, such as paying back taxes and an additional fine, receiving work permits, learning English, and not committing crimes.Ashley Killough, Jeb Bush on immigration: My plan is 'dignified', CNN (September 21, 2015). Bush has rejected characterizations of his plan as \\"amnesty,\\" arguing that his plan is \\"dignified\\" and \\"the most practical way of dealing with this problem.\\" Bush has expressed support for tougher enforcement of immigration laws, including prosecution of businesses that try to hire illegal aliens. In a January 2015 speech, Bush stated of people who have overstayed their visas, \\"We ought to be able to find where they are and politely ask them to leave.\\" On the campaign trail in 2015, Bush criticized hard-line anti-immigration proposals made Donald Trump and others, who Bush called \\"louder voices\\" in the Republican Party.David Siegel, Jeb Bush jabs Donald Trump as 'not realistic' on immigration, CNN (August 31, 2015). Bush had criticized proposals by Trump and others to build border wall between Mexico and the United States, calling such a wall unnecessary, logistically impossible, and expensive. Similarly, Bush has repeatedly criticized proposals to simply round up and deport illegal immigrants.Alex Leary, Jeb Bush's immigration plan: 'Find where they are and politely ask them to leave' , Tampa Bay Times (January 27, 2015).Tom Benning, Jeb Bush chides GOP's 'louder voices' for hard-line immigration views, Dallas Morning News (September 21, 2015).Alex Leary, Jeb Bush faces the heat at CPAC and stands ground, Tampa Bay Times (February 27, 2015). Speaking on John Catsimatidis' radio show in August 2015, Bush said that Trump's proposal to deport all illegal immigrants \\"would tear family lives asunder\\" and was unconstitutional. In September 2015, speaking at the national convention of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Bush called for comprehensive immigration reform, and said \\"We don't need to deport every person that's in this country [illegally]. That's not a practical, conservative plan. That won't solve the problems.\\" In September 2015, Bush \\"offered a sharp rebuke of the notion of multiculturalism,\\" saying: \\"We should not have a multicultural society.\\"Jason Noble, In Cedar Falls, Jeb Bush warns against multiculturalism, Des Moines Register (September 22, 2015). Bush says that he wants to increase the number of people permitted to immigrate to the U.S. based on their skills, while decreasing the number who immigrate because of family relationships. He compared President Obama's executive orders creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) programs to the decrees of \\"a Latin American dictator,\\" stating that he favors changes through legislation and not by executive order.Jeb Bush, Confronted by DREAMer, Compares Obama Orders to Decrees of 'Latin American Dictator', Bloomberg (March 7, 2015). Bush vowed to revoke those executive orders.Kevin Derby, Jeb Bush Vows to Repeal Obama's Immigration Executive Actions, Sunshine State News (April 21, 2015). Previously, in March 2013, Bush stated on NBC's Meet the Press that comprehensive immigration reform could take either the path to citizenship or a path to legalization, but that illegal immigrants should not get these benefits at lower cost than legal immigrants. Bush also stated that the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill (which passed the Senate in 2013, but was never taken up by the House) was a \\"good effort\\" in addressing the problem. In October 2013, Bush again called for passage of immigration reform. In April 2014, Bush said of those who \\"crossed the border because they had no other means to work to be able to provide for their family\\": \\"Yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime that there should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families.\\" The \\"act of love\\" remark became the subject of Act of Love, an attack ad by the campaign of Bush's rival Trump regarded by some as a turning point in the campaign. In an August 2015 Republican primary debate, Bush said that he stood by his comment. In July 2015, Bush said that federal funds should be withheld from so-called \\"sanctuary cities,\\" jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Elise Foley, Jeb Bush, Other Republicans Go After Funding For Sanctuary Cities, Huffington Post (July 8, 2015). \\"Bush acknowledged in his remarks that there are different types of sanctuary cities, but did not go into detail on how he would decide which would be blocked from receiving funding.\\" In a 2013 book and again in August 2015, Bush said that he disagreed with proposals to amend the Constitution to eliminate the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of jus soli (\\"birthright\\") citizenship to persons born in America.Ed O'Keefe, Jeb Bush on Donald Trump's immigration ideas: 'A plan needs to be grounded in reality'\\", Washington Post (August 17, 2015).Brianna Ehley, Breaking from rivals, Jeb Bush defends birthright citizenship, Politico (August 18, 2015).Eli Stokols & Eliza Collins, Jeb Bush: 'Anchor babies' is not an offensive term, Politico (August 20, 2015). Also in August 2015, Bush used the pejorative phrase \\"anchor babies\\" to refer to children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants, although he previously chaired the conservative Hispanic Leadership Network group, which had issued a memo advising Republicans to not use the term. Bush later said that he did not believe the phrase was offensive and that he did not regret using the phrase.Ashley Killough, Fiery Jeb Bush gets testy over 'anchor babies' term, CNN (August 20, 2015). At an August 2015 campaign event, Bush asserted that \\"The federal government right now does not deport criminals ... criminals should be deported, and right now the Obama administration is not doing that.\\"Amy Sherman, Jeb Bush says, wrongly, Obama administration is not deporting criminals, PolitiFact (August 26, 2015). PolitiFact rated this claim \\"false,\\" noting that in 2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported about 86,000 illegal immigrants convicted of previous crimes. Marijuana Bush believes that each state should decide on marijuana legalization. He has opposed measures to allow either recreational or medical marijuana in his home state of Florida. In 2014, he opposed the \\"United For Care\\" amendment (Florida Amendment 2), a proposed state constitutional amendment on the ballot which would have \\"allow[ed] physicians to recommend medical marijuana to people with 'debilitating' medical conditions.\\"Marc Caputo, Jeb Bush conflicted over feds role in medical-marijuana enforcement, Miami Herald (August 15, 2014). Bush issued a statement reading, \\"I strongly urge Floridians to vote against Amendment 2.\\"Ashley Killough, Jeb Bush opposes Florida medical marijuana ballot initiative, CNN (August 15, 2014). Bush is \\"conflicted\\" over whether the federal government should enforce federal marijuana laws in states in which medical marijuana is legal under state law, stating \\"I don't know. I'd have to sort that out.\\" Bush has acknowledged that he smoked marijuana while a high school student at Phillips Academy.Michael Kranish, Jeb Bush shaped by troubled Phillips Academy years, Boston Globe (February 1, 2015). He says that choice was \\"wrong\\" and a \\"stupid decision.\\" Native Americans In talk radio interviews in September and October 2015, Bush defended the Washington Redskins' controversial name, which Native American groups have protested for years as racially offensive.

In 2011, Bush wrote: \\"Republican candidates should categorically reject the notion that President Obama was not born in the United States.\\" In 2015, Bush stated of Obama: \\"He's an American, he's a Christian.\\" Puerto Rico In April 2015, Bush said in San Juan that the political status of Puerto Rico should be determined by Puerto Ricans (saying \\"This should be a question of self- determination\\") and that he supported statehood (saying \\"I think statehood is the best path, personally. I have believed that for a long, long while\\").Ashley Killough & Terence Burlij, In Puerto Rico, Jeb Bush pushes for statehood, CNN (April 29, 2015). Bush said the next president should \\"use their influence\\" to pressure Congress into taking an up-or-down vote on whether to admit Puerto Rico to the Union. On the Puerto Rican debt crisis, Bush supports granting Puerto Rico the option of using Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code to restructure its debts.Steven Mufson, Puerto Rican debt crisis forces its way onto presidential political agenda, Washington Post (July 8, 2015).Michelle Kaske & Alexander Lopez, Jeb Bush Says Puerto Rico Agencies Should Have Access to Bankruptcy, Bloomberg News (April 28, 2015). Terri Schiavo case During the Terri Schiavo case in 2003 while he was governor, the Florida state legislature passed legislation (\\"Terri's Law\\") giving Bush authority to intervene in the case. Bush ordered a feeding tube reinserted, and sent the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from a hospice where she was staying. In 2004, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously overturned the law as unconstitutional.Florida court strikes down 'Terri's Law': Woman's parents, spouse at odds over removing feeding tube, CNN (September 23, 2004). In early 2015, Bush referred to the case, and defended his actions, suggesting that a way to deal with such situations in the future would be by requiring Medicare recipients to sign advance directives outlining end-of-life care instructions before receiving benefits. Science and technology Net neutrality Bush is an opponent of net neutrality (calling it \\"one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard\\") and has said that \\"I hope that Congress acts\\" to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules.Zeke J. Miller, Jeb Bush: Net Neutrality Decision Is 'Crazy', Time (March 7, 2015).

Voter purges while governor of Florida During Bush's tenure as governor of Florida, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris oversaw a \\"botched\\" voter purge of the Florida voters' roll.Scott Conroy, Florida Voter Purge Fiasco May Complicate Jeb Bush's Appeal to Minorities, Huffington Post (June 25, 2015). The initiative was aimed at removing ineligible voters from the rolls, but when program was launched, \\"it became immediately clear that the effort was generating a slew of false positives. Voters in good standing, who happened to share names with convicted felons, but had never been in trouble with the law, were being taken off the voting rolls.\\" A number of emails from aggrieved voters who had been wrongfully removed from the voters' roll were sent to various Jeb Bush email accounts. The purge \\"wrongfully denied thousands of legitimate voters the ability to participate\\" in an extremely close presidential contest in Florida, which ultimately led to the Florida election recount in 2000 and Bush v. Gore, a Supreme Court ruling which ultimately decided the election. Estimates vary widely on how many people had been wrongly denied the right to vote; a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation concluded \\"that at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged,\\" but other reports put the figure much higher.Amy Sherman, Hillary Clinton revisits Florida's 2000 and 2004 voter purge when Jeb Bush was governor, Politifact (June 9, 2015).

The report found that Bush and Harris's \\"overall lack of leadership in protecting voting rights was largely responsible for the broad array of problems in Florida during the 2000 election,\\" but did not find that they \\"conspired to disenfranchise voters.\\" Ahead of the 2004 election, the State of Florida attempted, but ultimately canceled, a second voter purge described as \\"botched.\\" In 2004, a lawsuit forced the state to make public a list of 47,000 potential felons on the voting rolls; the Miami Herald reported in July 2004 that more than 2,000 names were incorrectly listed, and due to a database flaw, almost all Hispanic felons were omitted from the list. Less than two weeks after the list became public, the state stopped the initiative; Bush stated at the time that \\"Not including Hispanic felons that may be voters on the list ... was an oversight and a mistake ... And we accept responsibility and that's why we're pulling it back.\\" Other voting positions while governor of Florida In 2004, Bush signed legislation creating a statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting.Katie Sanders, Charlie Crist says Jeb Bush extended early voting, Politifact (November 8, 2012). According to Politifact: \\"Election supervisors said it was highly popular and asked the Legislature to expand early voting hours and add more locations. But Bush and the GOP-led Legislature went the other way the next year, passing a law that capped the number of hours for early voting and confined it to election offices, city halls and libraries.\\" As governor of Florida, Bush frequently made the restoration of ex-felons' civil rights (including the right to vote) contingent on sobriety from drugs or alcohol. At the same time, 32 of Bush's line-item vetoes (totaling almost $13 million) cut funding for programs for substance-abuse treatment and offender-reintegration programs.Pema Levy, Jeb Bush Made Voting Rights Contingent on Sobriety, but Cut Funding for Treatment, Mother Jones (October 29, 2015). ==Economic issues== Agriculture and farm subsidies Bush has declined to express a position on subsidies to corn farmers.Patricia Mazzei, In Iowa, Jeb Bush tackles ethanol subsidies and immigration reform -- and plugs Publix, Miami Herald (March 7, 2015). Bush supports country-of-origin labeling regulations for meat. Bush opposes the labeling of genetically-engineered foods. Bailouts Bush, who served as a senior advisor to the Barclays banking company after leaving office as Florida governor, supported the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (the \\"Wall Street bailout\\"), which initially authorized $700 billion in loans from the U.S. government to the banking sector.Alexandra Jaffe, Jeb Bush's banking career ripe for attack, CNN (December 18, 2014).Rosalind S.

Clinton Twists Bush's Words, Annenberg Public Policy > Center, FactCheck.org (July 16, 2015). Later the same day, Bush said that his statement \\"people need to work longer hours\\" referred to part-time workers who want to work longer hours, in line with Bush's previous statements about the problem of underemployment. In September 2015, Bush unveiled his tax plan.Ed O'Keefe, Kelsey Snell & Jim Tankersley, Jeb Bush's new tax plan could cost $3.4 trillion over next decade, Washington Post (September 9, 2015). The plan would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; allow companies to immediately deduct their capital investments; phase out the taxation of U.S. corporate income earned abroad; cut the capital-gains tax rate for individuals from 23.8 percent to 20 percent; eliminate the alternative minimum tax and federal estate tax; double the size of the standard deduction; expand the earned income tax credit; reduce the current seven income tax brackets (ranging from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three brackets of 10 percent, 25 percent and 28 percent; and eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes.Josh Barro, Jeb Bush's Tax Plan Is a Large Tax Cut for the Wealthiest, New York Times (September 9, 2015).Matt O'Brien, The Bush tax cuts are back, just with more exclamation points, Washington Post (September 10, 2015). Bush's plan would zero out the marriage penalty for married couples filing joint returns, but his plan would not reduce marriage penalties on some tax credits; low-income couples \\"could lose some or all of their earned income tax credit (EITC) by choosing to marry.\\"Roberton Williams, Despite Promises, Jeb Bush’s Tax Plan Wouldn’t Eliminate Marriage Penalties, TaxVox (Tax Policy Center) (September 15, 2015).

Speaking in September 2015 on Fox News Sunday, Bush said that the Bush tax policies \\"didn't (add to the deficit) as greatly as the static thinkers on the left think\\" because they \\"created a dynamic effect of high growth.\\"Louis Jacobson, Jeb Bush says tax policies of George W. Bush 'created a dynamic effect of high growth', Politifact (September 27, 2015). Politifact rated this assertion \\"mostly false,\\" concluding that \\"the evidence doesn't show that high growth occurred in the wake of the Bush tax cuts.\\" An analysis of Bush's tax plan by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center conducted by economist Leonard Burman and others estimated that the plan would lose $6.8 trillion in the first decade (relative to the current tax code), and $8.6 trillion in the next decade.Jared Bernstein, It's official: The Bush tax plan loses trillions and worsens inequality, Washington Post (December 11, 2015). The Center concluded: \\"The [Bush] plan would improve incentives to work, save, and invest, but unless accompanied by very large spending cuts, it could increase the national debt by as much as 50 percent of GDP by 2036, which would tend to put a drag on the economy.\\"Len Burman et al., An Analysis of Governor Bush's Tax Plan (December 8, 2015). Under traditional accounting methods, Bush's plan would add $3.4 trillion to the U.S. national debt over ten years. Before the plan was released, the Bush campaign commissioned four Republican economists to write an analysis of the plan; their report, which used \\"dynamic scoring\\" accounting methods favored by Republicans, determined that the Bush plan would add $1.2 trillion to the debt and stimulate an additional 0.5 percent of GDP growth annually.John Cassidy, Jeb Bush and the Return of Voodoo Economics, New Yorker (September 10, 2015). According to The New York Times, the 0.5 percent estimate was not based on an economic model, but rather was chosen by the four Republican economists as an \\"educated guess\\"; economists \\"disagree wildly\\" on tax policy's effects on economic growth.Josh Barrow, How Economists Forecast Growth Under Jeb Bush? By Guessing, New York Times (September 14, 2015). Bush's plan would cut federal income tax rates across the board, but wealthiest taxpayers would enjoy the largest tax cuts, although the wealthiest taxpayers would get lower benefit in terms of the tax reduction percentage, and in terms of being dropped from the income-tax rolls altogether.McKinnon, John. Top 1% Are Biggest Winners in Jeb Bush's Tax Plan, Wall Street Journal (September 10, 2015): \\"To be sure, by other measures middle-class households do better under Mr. Bush's plan. In percentage reduction in taxes, it's hard to beat the 100% that married couples making $38,600 would get. He brags that he'd knock another 15 million households off the income-tax rolls altogether. Higher-income households get far lower benefit by that measure.\\" A New York Times analysis concludes that the plan \\"would reduce the effective income tax rate on filers making $10 million or more per year to approximately 21 percent, down from 26 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available.\\" A Tax Foundation analysis determined that the greatest percent increases in after-tax income under Bush's tax plan would go to the top 1% of U.S. earners, those earning more than around $406,000; such filers \\"would see their after-tax incomes increase on average by 11.6% ... the biggest change for any income group.\\" According to Citizens for Tax Justice, more than half of Bush's tax cuts (52.9%) would accrue to the wealthiest 1%, while the poorest 20% of wage earners would receive less than a 3% tax cut.John D. McKinnon, Top 1% Are Biggest Winners in Jeb Bush's Tax Plan, Wall Street Journal (September 10, 2015). The plan would eliminate federal income taxes for families making $38,600 or less annually and would reduce federal taxes by a third for an additional 42 million families.Philip Elliott, Jeb Bush Would Save $773,000 Under His New Tax Plan, Time (September 11, 2015). Bush opposes tax increases, but has declined to sign Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge.

A Bush spokesperson told the Washington Times in October 2014 that he does not support tax increases of any kind, although in 2012 Bush indicated he could accept a hypothetical budget deal containing one dollar in tax increases for every ten dollars of spending cuts. As Florida governor While Bush was in office, \\"Florida's outstanding debt rose from $15 billion to more than $23 billion. The state's annual debt service payments rose from $928 million to $1.7 billion.\\"Adam C. Smith, What you don't know about Jeb Bush's economic record, Tampa Bay Times (May 1, 2015). According to a South Florida Sun-Sentinel news analysis, as Florida governor, Bush \\"championed tax cuts that chiefly benefited business and the wealthy.\\"Linda Kleindienst, The Jeb Bush Era Ends in Florida, South Florida Sun-Sentinel (January 7, 2007). Under Bush's governorship, Florida reduced and then repealed the state's 0.2% tax on stocks, bonds, and other intangible assets. During Bush's tenure, the state also increased its reserves from $1.3 billion to $9.8 billion, which coincided with Florida receiving the highest possible bond rating for the first time. Bush was governor during one of the strongest revenue periods for the state of Florida, due in part to the boom in property values fueled by the U.S. housing bubble, so that revenue grew despite the tax cuts he implemented.Bob Davis, Florida's Economic Leap Under Jeb Bush Helped By Housing Bubble, Economists Say, Wall Street Journal (July 7, 2015).Jim Tankersle, Under Jeb Bush, housing prices fueled Florida’s boom. Then it all went bust, Washington Post (July 27, 2015). Bush also instituted several state sales tax holidays and enacted a manufacturing deduction for electricity. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has stated that Bush was \\"a prolific tax cutter, but he let spending rise quickly toward the end of his tenure.\\" In its biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors, the Cato Institute gave Bush grades of \\"B \\"(2000), \\"A\\" (2002), \\"B\\" (2004), and \\"C\\" (2006). Bush has said that during his tenure as Florida governor, $19.3 billion in tax cuts were enacted.Joshua Gillin, Jeb Bush says he cut Florida taxes by $19 billion, but did he really?, Politifact (June 11, 2015). Politifact rated this statement as \\"half true,\\" saying it \\"partially accurate but leaves out important details.\\" Politifact noted that the $19.3 billion figure is based on estimates and projections for cumulative revenue changes each year. A large amount of the claimed $19.3 billion also comes from the phase-out of the federal estate tax, which was enacted by an act of Congress and not by the Florida state government. Economist Martin Sullivan, in a report for Tax Analysts, concluded that tax cuts in Florida totaled $13 billion during the eight-year Bush era; Sullivan's figure is not adjusted for inflation and excludes the estate tax (because it required no legislative action to go into effect). The tax cuts resulted in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. Bush vetoed $2 billion from state budgets (Florida has a line-item veto). According to a National Association of State Budget Officers report, state spending in Florida was cut by an average of 1.39 percent each year that Bush was in office as governor, with most cuts coming from public assistance, higher education, and state discretionary spending.Linda Qiu, Jeb Bush says he's cut spending 'more than anybody', PolitiFact (September 9, 2015).

In a December 2015 campaign appearance, Bush said that he was \\"open to the idea\\" of reinstating the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which created a firewall between investment banks and commercial banks and was repealed by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999. As a presidential candidate in 2015, Bush has proposed eliminating various consumer protection and food safety regulations, and imposing a freeze on new regulations.Beth Reinhard & Nick Timiraos, Jeb Bush Proposes Rollback of Regulations: Targets include emissions limits and consumer-protection laws, Wall Street Journal (September 22, 2015). Bush also proposed a new requirement that \\"the cost of any new regulation must be offset by another's savings\\" and endorsed \\"a proposal that would require an up-or- down vote by Congress on economic regulations that cost at least $100 million.\\" Corporate subsidies In 2003, Bush put together an \\"unprecedented\\" package of over $500 million in state and local incentive money to lure the Scripps Research Institute to expand into Palm Beach County, Florida.Noah Bierman, How one big promise Jeb Bush made to Florida's economy has yet to deliver, Los Angeles Times (August 24, 2015). The package, described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"incredibly generous ... even by the standards of economic development deals,\\" offered \\"new facilities, equipment and enough operating money to pay staff salaries for years\\" in an effort to spur the biotechnology industry. In promoting the plan, Bush made ambitious predictions of 40,000 jobs in spin-off jobs within 15 years of operation. Twelve years later, the plan largely \\"failed to deliver the blockbuster biotech cluster Bush promised,\\" and in 2014 there were only 27,611 biotech jobs in Florida, according to the state statistics. The use of corporate subsidies as part of economic-development plans declined in popularity after Bush left office,Beth Reinhard, Jeb Bush Faulted Over Use of Florida Tax Money: Club for Growth criticizes plan to lure businesses, Wall Street Journal (June 12, 2015). and the free-market advocacy group Club for Growth criticized Bush for the Scripps scheme in a 2015 report. A Bush spokesman defended the initiative, saying that it \\"diversified the economy, created high-wage jobs and contributed to significant scientific research advances.\\" Gambling Before and during his term as governor of Florida, Bush was an opponent of expanded legalized gambling in the state. Before his term, Bush had served on the board of the anti-casino group No Casinos.Linda Qiu & Amy Sherman, Jeb Bush said Donald Trump wanted casino gambling in Florida, got told 'no', Politifact (September 16, 2015). In 1999, Bush told the St. Petersburg Times: \\"I am opposed to casino gambling in this state and I am opposed whether it is on Indian property or otherwise ... The people have spoken and I support their position.\\" (Bush was referring to three failed referendums to approve casino gambling).Jeremy Diamond, Jeb Bush: The man who killed Trump's casino dreams, CNN (September 1, 2015). International trade Bush has repeatedly expressed support for Trans-Pacific Partnership, writing \\"I have no problem supporting TPP.\\"Ed O'Keefe, Jeb Bush knocks Hillary Clinton’s wavering on trade deal, Washington Post (April 22, 2015).

I think state minimum wages are fine.\\"Danny Vinik, Jeb Bush Almost Proposed Abolishing the Minimum Wage, New Republic (March 18, 2015).Associated Press, Jeb Bush Rejects Idea of Raising Federal Minimum Wage (March 17, 2015). Bush later clarified that he is just opposed to raising the federal minimum wage, and does not support abolishing it altogether. As Florida governor, Bush opposed a 2004 ballot measure (approved by Florida voters) which indexed the state minimum wage to inflation. Privatization and public employees In his unsuccessful 1994 race for governor, Bush \\"talked about 'blowing up' state agencies, and said he wanted to 'club [Florida's] government into submission.'\\" As governor, Bush was a proponent of privatization and shrinking the state workforce.Alec MacGillis, The Education of Jeb Bush, The New Yorker (January 26, 2015) (\\"Jeb's program, by contrast, was of a piece with his larger agenda to privatize state-run services, from prisons to Medicaid.\\").

Other state services that were privatized under Bush include the \\"state government's personnel department, ... its prison food services, its Medicaid program, and its defense of death-row inmates.\\"Jennifer Rubin, Morning Bits, Washington Post (January 5, 2015) (quoting Matthew T.

Bush unsuccessfully pushed to privatize the State Library collection and move its collection to a private university. In a speech at Florida State University in Tallahassee in July 2015, Bush called for adopting a \\"three-out, one-in rule across the federal workforce\\" (with exceptions for positions deemed \\"critical\\"). Under this system, only one new federal hire would be made for every three federal employees who leave.Eric Katz, Jeb Bush: Strip Feds of Automatic Pay Raises and Due Process, Government Executive (July 20, 2015).Jennifer Rubin, How Jeb Bush contrasts himself with Hillary Clinton, Obama and GOP competitors, Washington Post (July 21, 2015).

In the same speech, Bush called for stripping federal employees of certain civil service protections, but did not specify which civil service laws he would try to change. In an October 2015 interview with Sean Hannity, Bush said that: \\"Let's create a little bit of a recession in Washington, D.C., so that we can have economic prosperity outside of Washington.\\"Olivia Nuzzi, Jeb Wants a Recession in D.C., Having Forgotten That Real People Live There, Daily Beast (October 15, 2015).

Why would you say that about a place where 650,000 taxpayers live—many of whom are veterans?\\" \\"Sharing\\" or \\"gig economy\\" Bush has defended companies identified with the sharing economy or gig economy, such as Uber and Airbnb, calling them positive examples of disruptive innovation.Alan He, Jeb Bush stands up for Uber and the sharing economy, CBS News (July 16, 2016).

His position attracted scrutinity given the fact that the retirement age is 66, not 65 as Bush stated, and that under current law, full benefits must be delayed to 67. Bush has called for raising the retirement age \\"gradually, over a long period of time for people that are just entering the system. And I think we need to do that in relatively short order.\\"Shane Goldmacher, Jeb Bush Backs Hike in Social Security Retirement Age, National Journal (April 2015). Bush has specifically proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security from its current target age of 67 by one month every year, starting in 2015, so that by 2022, workers would have to be 70 to claim full benefits, or 65 for early benefits.Ashley Killough, Jeb Bush rolls out proposals for Social Security, Medicare, CNN (October 27, 2015). Bush has also proposed means- testing Social Security (i.e., reducing benefits for higher-income seniors). He also proposed eliminating a provision that reduces Social Security benefits to seniors who work and make more than $15,720 a year, and eliminating a 6.2% payroll tax on seniors who work beyond the retirement age.

Tim Mak of the Daily Beast, writing in August 2015, similarly noted that Bush is not pressing for \\"an aggressive policy shift\\" and that \\"many of the things [that Bush] is advocating for are being pursued by Obama and his administration,\\" including U.S. support for the Iraqi forces, provision of U.S. aid to Kurdish fighters, U.S. engagement with Sunni tribes, and U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS.Tim Mak, Jeb Bush's Iraq Policy Looks a Lot Like Obama's—Not Dubya's, Daily Beast (August 12, 2015). Mak noted that \\"on the issue of arming the Kurds directly instead of the current policy, sending aid through the central Iraqi government, an issue his fellow Republicans have raised, Bush is silent.\\" In November 2015, Bush called for \\"overwhelming force\\" to be used against ISIL, including the deployment of U.S. ground troops, saying: \\"While air power is essential, it alone cannot bring the results we seek.

Bush has not explained how Assad should be removed. In May 2015, Bush stated that he would have ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq had he been president at the time: \\"I would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got.\\" He also indicated that the lack of focus on post- invasion security was a mistake. Several days later, Bush stated: \\"knowing what we know now, ... I would not have engaged. ... I would not have gone into Iraq.\\" According to reporting by CNN, \\"Bush argued that the invasion--though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence--had been beneficial, saying the world was 'significantly safer' without Saddam Hussein in power.\\" In an August 2015 speech, Bush defended his brother's handling of the Iraq War, stating: \\"I'll tell you, taking out Saddam Hussein turned out to be a pretty good deal.\\"Reid J.

Bush has called for reversing the sequestration cuts as applied to the military, which reduced the U.S. military budget by $1 trillion. Bush has proposed a costly military buildup.Martin Matishak, From Bombers to Subs, Inside Bush's Costly Plan to Expand the Military, Fiscal Times (November 17, 2015). Bush's plan calls for increasing the size of the Army by 40,000 soldiers and increasing the size of the Marine Corps by an additional 4,000 marines. He also favors increasing Navy submarine production, favoring plans to build two Virginia-class submarines a year (each such ship costs about $3 billion). Bush has also pledged to \\"'halt the mothballing of certain ships, such as cruisers, slated for premature retirement due to budget cuts,' a move that could cost hundreds of millions.\\" For the Air Force, Bush proposed purchasing of a \\"minimum\\" of one hundred Long Range Strike Bombers, which would cost more than $100 billion. Bush also supports the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history ($400 billion), but also \\"would explore other options for air supremacy,\\" including a restoration of the F-22 or speeding up development of a new \\"air superiority combat system.\\" Bush also supports renovation of the U.S. nuclear weapon arsenal. Refugees In September 2015, Bush stated that the United States should accept some refugees of the Syrian Civil War as long as there were adequate checks to \\"make sure that they're not part of ISIS or something like that,\\" noting that the United States \\"has a noble tradition of accepting refugees.\\"Nick Gass, Jeb Bush cracks a joke about Donald Trump's hair, Politico (September 9, 2015).Alex Leary, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush open to U.S. accepting some Syrian refugees, Miami Herald (September 9, 2015).Alan He, Jeb Bush: I'm still Donald Trump's biggest target, CBS News (September 11, 2015).

He retired from his directorship in 2014, becoming emeritus director. ==Work== Streeck's research is focused on analyzing the political economy of capitalism, wherein he proposes to take on a dialectical approach to institutional analysis as opposed to the more rigid varieties of capitalism. He has written extensively on the political economy of Germany and more recently has involved himself in debates over the politics of austerity, the rise of what he terms the debt- state as a result of the neoliberal revolution of the 1980s and the future of the European Union. End of capitalism In 2014, Streeck wrote an article in the New Left Review where he postulates how capitalism might come to an end, discussing several factors that make this likely to happen. Streeck posits that because contemporary capitalism is beset by five disorders—declining growth, oligarchy, starvation of the public sphere, corruption and international anarchy—for which at present no political agency exists to confront them, it will continue to regress and atrophy until at some point it might end. He expanded on this theme in a 2016 book How Will Capitalism End? ==Personal life== Streeck and his wife live in part of the farmyard of a castle in Brühl, a small town close to Cologne. ==References * Max-Planck Institute Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) declares that \\"all native species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, invertebrates, and plants, and their habitats, threatened with extinction and those experiencing a significant decline which, if not halted, would lead to a threatened or endangered designation, will be protected or preserved.\\" In California the Department of Fish and Wildlife oversees CESA and makes sure that citizens are following laws/regulations that are in place. They also have a huge impact on what species are added to CESA as they survey species populations in the wild. The Department of Fish and Wildlife issues citation to violators, fines of up to $50,000 and/or one year imprisonment for crimes involving endangered species, and fines of up to $25,000 and/or six months imprisonment for crimes involving threatened species. ==History== In 1970, California was one of the first states to officially create statutory schemes for protecting endangered wildlife and environments. This was completed earlier than the Federal Government’s Endangered Species Act; ESA, which was mandated in 1973. However, according to the chronologies listed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, California began preservation and protection statutes in 1909 when non-game birds were first protected. In 1957, rules were devised to prevent the “taking” of animals or plants under protection. The term “to take” is basically defined as removing, harming, or killing the protected species. However, the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) explicitly defines 'take' as not including the terms 'harm' or harass', while these terms do appear in the federal ESA definition of 'take'. This has been interpreted to mean that in California, 'take' of a listed species must involve mortality, as opposed to habitat alteration that adversely impacts the listed species. The year 1970 brought about two major California enactments: the California Species Preservation Act, and the California Endangered Species Act. The Species Preservation Act tasked the Department with creating an inventory of all fish and wildlife that could be considered rare or endangered. The list was to be reported to the Legislature along with suggestions on methods for protection. The California Endangered Species Act put into effect the Department’s authority to determine the designation under which wildlife was labeled as “rare” or “endangered” and provided restrictions on the importing and moving of those species except by permit. At the time, this Act did not include plants or insects. In 1984, CESA was amended and became a more complex Act that determined it the state’s responsibility to preserve and protect endangered species. The amendment to CESA now included plant species and also announced the intention to purchase lands for preservation of protected species. Mitigation and enhancement methods were also introduced. In 1997, CESA was amended again to allow the “incidental taking” of protected species beyond the original ruling of scientific and educational purposes only. This has been cause for some controversy. ==CESA process overview== While CESA is considered effective, the multitude of agencies working within the framework of CESA can lead to poor communication and effectiveness due to entities working at cross purposes, which ultimately leads to less protection and poorer use of time and resources for conservation programming. ==Listing== The listing process includes procedures for individuals, organizations or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Petitions can be submitted to the Department for a species, subspecies, or variety of any plant or animal to add, delete, or note a change in status on the list of endangered or threatened species. The petitions will be handled by the Habitat Conservation Planning Branch. The process includes reviewing a region where the species is in habitation, conducting a visit to where the species is, and presenting a report. After 90 days of the petition, the Habitat Conservation Planning Branch sends the report to the director for approval. If the petition is approved the species becomes a candidate species. As of March, 2015, CESA lists 49 animals as Endangered and another 37 as Threatened. An additional 4 species are candidates for listing as either threatened or endangered. No species are proposed for delisting. As of April, 2015 CESA lists 132 land plant species as Endangered, 22 as Threatened, and 64 as Rare. No species are currently candidates for listing. ==Comparison to similar laws== California's endangered species act is considered superior to similar acts enacted in other states due to its comprehensive design, its involvement in the pursuit of prevention, and for its cooperative relationships with programs such as Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP). ==LitigationReferencesFurther reading Category:1970 in California Category:1970 in the environment Category:1970 in law Category:California law Category:Endangered biota of the United States Category:Environment of California Category:Environmental law in the United States ","title":"California Endangered Species Act"},{"id":"46390341","text":"Waldemar Pedrazzi (born 7 April 1955) is a Uruguayan former cyclist.

The settlements in the parish are the hamlets of Cadley, Clench Common and Forest Hill. Savernake Forest covers the eastern half of the parish. ==History== Two Roman roads cross the parish, one from Mildenhall to Old Salisbury and the other between Cirencester and Winchester. There is a Romano-British kiln site in the forest. The eastern end of Wansdyke, an early medieval defensive earthwork, is in the northeast of the parish. A 2009 study by English Heritage (now Historic England) examined aerial photographs of Savernake Forest together with data from a 2007 Lidar survey carried out for the Forestry Commission. Many new archaeological sites were found, ranging from the Neolithic to the Second World War. ==Cadley== The hamlet of Cadley () is at the edge of Savernake Forest, on the A346 between Marlborough and Burbage. An Anglican church, Christchurch, was built by T.H. Wyatt in 1851 for the Marquess of Ailesbury. It was closed in 1975 and declared redundant in 1979, then sold for residential use. ==Clench Common== The hamlet of Clench Common () is a small agricultural community in the northwest of the parish, on the A345 between Marlborough and Pewsey. It is north of the hamlet of Clench which is in Milton Lilbourne parish. Clench Common Airfield is a grass strip about east of the hamlet, used by microlight aircraft. ==Local government== The parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Savernake parish was created in 1934, with boundary changes in 1987; predecessor parishes were North Savernake and South Savernake (with Brimslade and Cadley). ==Canal== When the Kennet and Avon Canal was opened in 1810 it crossed the parish, which extended further south than the present-day parish. Wootton Top Lock was formerly known as Cadley Lock. ==Railways== The Berks and Hants line, part of a Great Western Railway route from London to Devon and Cornwall, was built close to the canal in 1862. Savernake station (later Savernake Low Level) was beyond the southeast border of the parish, towards Burbage. On 14 November 1941 the station was the scene of the tragic death of Edward Huskinson, who had been the editor of the Tatler magazine for 32 years, after he became stuck between a train and the platform edge.https://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-edward-huskinson-editor-of-the- tatler-magazine-image18066629.html The station closed in 1966 but the line remains open; the nearest stations are at Bedwyn and Pewsey. A branch – the Marlborough Railway – between Savernake Low Level and Marlborough was built through the parish in 1864. In 1896 the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway built another line between a second Marlborough station and a second Savernake station, Savernake High Level, near to the first. The original branch line closed in 1933, the High Level station closed in 1961 and Low Level (by then renamed Savernake for Marlborough) in 1966; the line was later removed. During World War II a large ammunition store was established north of Savernake station, with sidings for rail to road transfer. ==Schools== A National School was opened at Cadley in 1850. It closed owing to low numbers of pupils in 1939. Today the local schools are at Marlborough, Burbage and St Katharines (near Tottenham House, just over the boundary with Great Bedwyn parish). ==See also== * Marquess of Ailesbury – landowners * Tottenham House – built for the 1st Marquess of Ailesbury, about beyond the southeast boundary of the parish ==References Category:Civil parishes in Wiltshire ","title":"Savernake, Wiltshire"},{"id":"46390411","text":"The word hajduk entered the Polish language from Hungarian in the late 16th century. It was initially a colloquial term for a style of footsoldier, Hungarian or Turco-Balkan in inspiration, that was introduced by King Stephen Báthory in the 1570s, and who formed the backbone of the Polish infantry arm from the 1570s until about the 1630s. Unusually for this period, Polish- Lithuanian hajduks wore uniforms, typically of grey-blue woollen cloth, with red collar and cuffs. Their principal weapon was a small calibre matchlock firearm, known as an arquebus. For close combat they also carried a heavy variety of sabre, capable of hacking off the heads of enemy pikes and polearms. Contrary to popular opinion, the small axe they often wore tucked in their belt (not to be confused with the huge half-moon shaped bardiche axe, which was seldom carried by hajduks) was not a combat weapon, but rather was intended for cutting wood. In the mid 17th century hajduk-style infantry largely fell out of fashion in Poland-Lithuania, and were replaced by musket- armed infantry of Western style. However, commanders or hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth continued to maintain their own liveried bodyguards of hajduks, well into the 18th century as something of a throwback to the past, even though they were now rarely used as field troops. In imitation of these bodyguards, in the 18th century wealthy members of the szlachta hired liveried domestic servants who they called hajduks, thereby creating the meaning of the term 'hajduk' as it is generally understood in modern Polish.Brzezinski 1987, pp. 21, 39-41 ==ReferencesSources== * Richard Brzezinski, Polish Armies 1569-1696, volume 1, London: Osprey Military Publishing, 1987 (also contains six contemporary illustrations of Polish hajduks, besides several modern reconstructions by Angus McBride).

It was a speakeasy run by The Purple Gang during Prohibition and the Great Depression years featuring a hidden basement of gambling and alcohol for wealthy Midwestern summer Resort goers ==Introduction== Northwest northern lower Michigan has been the mid-west's summer playground for the wealthy since the 1890s. The Swift's, the Armour's, the Wrigley's, Gamble's (Procter & Gamble), Ford's and Wilson's (GM) all called northern Michigan's Harbor Springs-Petoskey their summer resort homes. The 1930s era of northwest lower Michigan was particularly a time of gala summer resort tourism despite the United States being in the throes of a deepening Great Depression. Besides Mackinac Island, the top summer resort town in the area, known as the \\"Tip of the Mitt\\", was Harbor Springs, a small village located on Little Traverse Bay. Little Traverse Bay, on Lake Michigan, was a sail boater's paradise. Petoskey, Michigan, located across the bay from Harbor Springs, was the first small northern Lake Michigan town to draw a summer clientele interested in relief from the city heat. Harbor Springs soon followed. Mid-western city dwellers also came north for the freedom from the suffering of hay fever and other allergies. ==The Manitou== From the late 1870s into the 20th Century's early years, the wealthy mid-westerners from Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit and St. Louis came north every summer via the many summer railroad passenger trains to Charlevoix, Petoskey, Mackinaw City (Mackinac Island) and Harbor Springs. They also came north via the Great Lakes on passenger steamships such as the \\"Manitou.\\" The passenger cruise steamer was the source of Harbor Springs, Michigan's famous Club Manitou, which opened July 4 week-end in 1929. It was the dream of Abe Bernstein of Detroit, Michigan. Bernstein was the head of the infamous Purple Gang of southeastern Michigan. He and his operatives controlled the import of illegal whiskey from Canada across the Detroit River into Michigan. From there it went to other mid-western cities such as Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis. Bernstein loved to spend his summers in Petoskey and Harbor Springs. While there he saw the tremendous wealth of the summer resorters who loved to drink and loved to gamble. ==Naples of the North== By the late 1920s, Harbor Springs was being referred to as, the \\"Naples of the North.\\" Wealthy mid-westerns would spend their summers at their Harbor Springs-Petoskey cottages, resorts, and hotels. In the winter, the same group would gather in places like Naples, Florida. Many of the wealthy cottages had summer homes in the Harbor Point Association, the Roaring Brook Association, the Wequetonsing Association, the Roaring Brook Association, and other private residential summer enclaves. All had grown up along the Harbor Springs' area's vast Little Traverse Bay-Lake Michigan shoreline. These affluent summer people came north for the July 4 through Labor Day \\"Summer Season,\\" and they dined and drank first at the Harbor Point Casino, then the Roaring Brook Casino, and after July 4, 1929, the new Club Manitou. The club was built with Abe Bernstein's Purple Gang profits and managed by his onetime driver and bodyguard, William \\"Slim\\" Al Gerhart. ==Prohibition in Michigan's Northland== Michigan instituted a prohibition against the selling of alcoholic spirits in 1917, two years before National Prohibition. That meant that the Purple Gang of Detroit had a head start learning how to thwart the law. The gang, under the Bernstein brothers direction, and Abe Bernstein in particular, developed a network of illegal smuggling methods that kept Detroit, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Al Capone's Chicago supplied with illegal booze. When the mid-western wealthy summer resorters came to Harbor Springs for their summer season they brought with them their desire for top-notch restaurant dining, top-shelf liquors and wines. Also came with them their desire to gamble, and that desire, along with fine dining, was filled by the Club Manitou. Not one advertisement was placed to announce the establishment's opening but, from word of mouth only, it was an instant success. Upstairs fine dining, and downstairs (in the fortified and protected basement) was the finest in \\"speakeasy\\" alcohol, slot machines, roulette tables, baccarat and poker tables, along with dancing and entertainment. ==Gambling at the Manitou== The Club Manitou, from late June 1929, until Labor Day of 1953, was the northland's finest summer spot for dance-gaming-drinking and nightly musical entertainment. The all-male professional wait staff and chefs were brought to northern Michigan from Club Vatel, New York City. The croupiers were imported from Ballard's Resort in French Lick, Indiana. The wines and liquors were bootlegged in from Windsor, Canada across the Detroit River into Michigan and then trucked north to Harbor Springs. Sometimes the wines and liquors arrived north by boat, via the Great Lakes in speedy motorized boats. Local authorities looked the other way at the illegal discretions being carried out at the Manitou. It employed several local northern Michigan people and the actual \\"locals\\" of the Harbor Springs- Petoskey area were not allowed inside. A strict policy by owner William Al Gerhart of Detroit and Harbor Springs was followed towards local exclusion. The Manitou was strictly for the summer wealthy resorters, and by keeping entrance to the club restricted, the police authorities of the area stayed on the sidelines. Being on the sideline was also reported to be helped by occasional \\"under the table payments\\" to the local county sheriff and other legal authorities in the area. ==Clubbing in the Northland== The only competition that faced the Purple Gang's manager William Gerhart's (aka \\"Detroit Slim\\")for the summer wealthy's attention and money was the Ramona Park Hotel Casino. However, it was soon noticeable to the summer patrons of both places that from the 1929 summer the Ramona Park Casino was old and out- dated. Besides the lack of the Ramona Park Casino's building physical attraction, the Club Manitou's imported French chefs, male professional waiters, and fine wines-crystal each summer from New York City's Club Vatel. The Manitou soon was the top dining and gambling spot in northern Michigan. However, in 1932, the Ramona Park Hotel sold its Ramona Park Casino building to Toledo, Ohio's Gerald \\"Jimmy\\" Hayes. Mr. Hayes was a master at providing fine dining and the types of gambling coveted by the wealthy. Beginning in the summer resort season of 1934, the new Ramona Park Casino was strongly competing for the summer resort trade of northern Michigan. ==Gentleman Jimmy Hayes== \\"Jimmy\\" Hayes was a well known Ohio gaming operator who had visited the Harbor Springs area on various summer vacations and decided he wanted part of the summer wealthy resorter's money. His newly purchased casino was renovated into the Ramona Club Casino in time for the summer season of 1934. The casino lasted longer than \\"Jimmy Hayes.\\" On October 4, 1934, while in Detroit to reportedly watch a World Series game between the Chicago Cubs and the Detroit Tigers, Hayes body was found in an alley. He had been shot many times at close range. During the next two summer seasons his wife Lenora ran the Ramona Club but decided to sell to Club Manitou's now owner-manager, William \\"Slim\\" Gerhart, after the 1936 season. Gerhart tore down the building and used the lumber to help renovate his newly purchased Harbor Springs bar that was located on the waterfront. Gerhart renamed it \\"Al's Pier Bar\\" and it existed until sold to become today's Pier Restaurant in 1968. ==Demise of the Manitou== The Club Manitou did so well in the late 1930s and early 1940s that owner Gerhart and wife Jeanne decided to triple its size in 1945. The new addition, built to the west of the original 1928 log cabin structure, opened in time for the July 4 – Labor Day summer season of 1946. It was an immediate success. The dining and dancing portions of the nightclub had been moved into the new addition while the illegal gambling activities (such as roulette, poker, baccarat and chuck-a-luck) remained in the steel door-protected basement portion of the old building. By the early 1950s the local authorities were under pressure from the state of Michigan to curb all local gambling in the northern sections the state. After a series of raids by the Michigan State Police, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission decided to remove the club's license to sell alcohol in fall 1953. Without that license, Gerhart decided not to open for the summer 1954 season. The two large structures in rural Harbor Springs, Michigan, stayed dormant until 1962. ==Club Ponytail== Club Ponytail was a famous upper mid-west teen dance nightclub of Harbor Springs from 1962–1969. Club Ponytail was a nationally known teen dance club featuring major rock and roll acts of the 1960s. On June 12, 1962, the long-dormant buildings of the former Club Manitou reopened under new owners to become the teen and collegiate nightclub named. Unlike its predecessor Club Manitou (1929–1954), liquor and gambling were no longer part of the offerings. However, fine entertainment and dancing was still offered. The Club Ponytail was one of the first of many teen entertainment and dance clubs beginning to operate in the United States during the early 1960s. Dick Clark's American Bandstand helped popularize dancing throughout the country. This new dance craze among teenagers helped spur the development of teen centers such as the Club Ponytail. Its official name was the “Club Ponytail Teen & Collegiate Nite Club.” The house drink was Green River Soda and \\"Poni's Pizza\\" was the favorite food offering of the establishment. Stan and Jean Douglas Club owners Stan and Jean Douglas, of Petoskey, Michigan, opened the teen dance center, with the idea of making money, and also providing a safe nightly venue for the area's teens. The large influx of mid-western vacationers to the Petoskey-Harbor Springs area of northern Michigan allowed the booking of major national rock and roll acts. The Douglas family wanted to provide summer resorter and local parents, with a wholesome, safe chaperoned environment for the night time gatherings of their teenagers. In order to draw in the teen crowd, Stan Douglas knew he needed the top names in entertainment for that age group. The Beachboys-Roy Orbison Northern Michigan's \\"Tip of the Mitt\\" area tripled in its size every July and August due to the influx of mid-west city dwellers. They came to their cottages, resort homes and resort hotels to enjoy Lake Michigan’s Little Traverse Bay. Using the Detroit Federation of Musicians as their main booking agent(also used by Detroit's famous Roostertail nightclub), Stan and Jean Douglas were able to bring such popular acts to the Ponytail as the Beach Boys (August 1963), the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Bobby Vinton, Del Shannon, the Temptations, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Marvin Gaye, Bob Seger, Bobby Vee, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, the Kingsmen (Louie Louie), Freddie Cannon, Dee Dee Sharp, the Four Tops, and Roy Orbison. The patio stars An enclosed brick-wall patio with two stages was added in 1965 and the ensuing outside venues drew crowds of 2,500 at a time. In the summer of 1965, Club Ponytail's house band that year was an Ann Arbor group called The Iguanas, featuring Jim Osterberg, who later became known as Iggy Pop. The Animals performed there on August 26, 1966 as well as THEM in August 1968. During the winter season, the Ponytail brought rock and roll stars to northern Michigan during the Christmas season when mid-western skiers flocked to the nearby hills of Boyne Highlands and Nob’s Nob ski resorts. Fire The last band to play the Club Poytail of Harbor Springs was Dean Mann's, The March Brother’s Band, on Sunday March 15, 1969. Two days later, on Tuesday evening March 18, the Ponytail was destroyed by fire. Local firemen theorized that fumes from a gas furnace caused an explosion and the building was immediately engulfed in flame. Though the Douglas family vowed to rebuild the Club Ponytail, it was not to be. The insurance payment for the building was not enough to allow reconstruction. What was left of the dance center was removed. Only the patio and the original Club Manitou building remained. Final year The final acts had already been booked when the building was destroyed. In the summer of 1969, they were performed on the patio and inside the other Douglas-owned nearby establishment, the Golden Horseshoe Supper Club. These acts included the Electric Prunes, the Pleasure Seekers, Mitch Ryder, and the Boyfriends. By the early 1970s, teen clubs were dying out, giving way to large concert venues. The Club Ponytail's demise was soon followed by the opening of (in the nearby summer resort town of Charlevoix, Michigan) Castle Farms “Rock n’ Roll Central” in 1976. Its outside concert facility featured such acts as Metallica, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, and once again, The Beach Boys. ==References *http://www.detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/purple-gang *Carnegie program *Do you remember Harbor Springs Club Ponytail *Club Ponytail at West Michigan Music Hysterical Society Category:Buildings and structures in Emmet County, Michigan Category:Nightclubs in the United States Category:Speakeasies Category:Casinos in Michigan Category:The Purple Gang ","title":"Club Manitou of Harbor Springs"},{"id":"46390485","text":"The Urbana-Lincoln Hotel - Lincoln Square Mall is a historic building complex located at 300 South Broadway Avenue in Urbana, Illinois. The Tudor Revival style hotel was built in 1923. In 1964, the mall was built as an extension of the hotel; it was one of the first fully enclosed shopping malls in Illinois. The hotel, the mall, and the building complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. As of October 2017, the mall was still in operation, however the hotel was closed. ==Hotel history== Urbana Landmark Hotel Mall Entrance A local booster organization called the Urbana Hotel Company began raising money for a hotel in Urbana in 1921. The group raised $223,000 by selling shares in the hotel, and construction on the Urbana- Lincoln Hotel began in 1923. The hotel opened to guests by November of that year and was formally dedicated on January 31, 1924. Local architect Joseph Royer designed the hotel in the Tudor Revival style; the building features extensive half-timbering on its stucco exterior. The hotel was not profitable, and the Urbana Hotel Company went bankrupt in 1937; the hotel stayed open after the company was reorganized. A new management company, the Urbana- Lincoln Company, took over the hotel in 1944 and extensively modernized it in the following decade. The hotel was incorporated into the mall's plans from the outset and was sold to mall owners Carson Pirie Scott shortly after the mall opened. After failing to turn a profit, the hotel closed in 1975 and was slated to be demolished. In the 1970s, the Jumer Hotel chain purchased the hotel. The new owners renovated and reopened the hotel later in the decade, and an addition was built on the building in 1982. The Jumer Hotel chain sold the hotel in 2001. From 2001 the hotel was bought and sold multiple times. In 2010, developer Xiao Jin \\"XJ\\" Yuan bought the hotel for $600,000, renaming it the Urbana Landmark Hotel. Yuan made renovations to the hotel, including fixing the roof, upgrading the HVAC and plumbing systems, and modernizing some rooms. Yuan's plans were to open the hotel in phases beginning in 2012. In July 2015, Yuan put the hotel up for sale for $5.4M, and the hotel closed in April 2016.. After three failed attempts to sell the hotel, Icon Hospitality LLC purchased the hotel in January 2020 for $1M, with plans to invest $15M into renovations and re-open the hotel as the Hilton Tapestry Urbana Landmark Hotel. ==Mall history== Exerior of the Urbana Landmark Hotel showing it no longer in operation Due to a general sentiment that Urbana's economy was stagnating, local business leaders reached out to several large retailers in the late 1950s in an attempt to attract a store to the city. Carson Pirie Scott expressed interest in the city if it were willing to build a large commercial development, sparking the Lincoln Square Mall project. The city began plans for a mall in 1960 and hired nationally recognized developer Victor Gruen to plan the mall. The Urbana Central Development Company, a subsidiary of Carson Pirie Scott, acquired the land for the mall in 1961, and the name Lincoln Square was chosen the following year. The mall was built and opened in 1964; when it opened, it became the first fully enclosed shopping mall in Illinois outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. and both of the state's U.S. Senators attended the mall's grand opening on September 17. The mall's stores mainly sold clothing and other fashionable goods in order to draw shoppers from surrounding areas; the developers intended for the mall to serve residents in a radius around Urbana. The mall was successful during its first two decades, and most of its original businesses either stayed or were replaced by similar businesses. Starting in the mid-1980s, however, competition from surrounding malls led to the beginning of the mall's decline. Carson Pirie Scott sold the mall in 1988; its anchor store was converted to a Bergner's and later a Herberger's. Herberger's and the mall's ownership group renovated the mall in 1994, but Herberger's went bankrupt three years later, and its store closed in 2002; the mall failed to attract another anchor and subdivided the store's space into smaller stores. The mall remains open and continues to house many smaller stores and law offices. ==References *Urbana Landmark Hotel *Entrance of the Urbana Landmark Hotel showing it no longer in operationLincoln Square Mall Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1923 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Champaign County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Urbana, Illinois Category:Shopping malls in Illinois ","title":"Urbana-Lincoln Hotel-Lincoln Square Mall"},{"id":"46390489","text":"Emil Ekblom (born 29 January 1994) is a Norwegian football striker who currently plays for KFUM. ==Career== Ekblom played youth and junior football for Stabæk before moving to the United States.

In February 2014, Peter Karran, the Leader of the Liberal Vannin Party, renounced his leadership in favour of Beecroft. Karran said that it \\"was time for a change.\\" She once revealed aspirations to bring more women into the House of Keys and to field a Liberal Vannin candidate in every constituency in the 2016 Manx general election.

Along with Paul Ninas and Will Henry Stevens, she has been credited with introducing modernism to New Orleans. ==Life and career== Crawford was the sixth of nine children of Charles Campbell Crawford and Louise Bienvenu Crawford, and grew up speaking English and French; through her mother she was descended from the Bienvenus, who had settled in Louisiana in the eighteenth century. Her maternal grandfather had purchased the family's townhouse, at 612 Royal Street in the French Quarter in 1839. Her father's family was from Belfast. In her youth she wrote poetry, much of it about the house and its surroundings; she spent time in North Carolina and in Biloxi, Mississippi as well, which further informed her sensibilities. She would return to Biloxi throughout her life. These childhood trips inspired her earliest known drawings, which date to 1896, though she is known to have carried a sketchbook as early as 1888. She traveled widely throughout her life, and is known to have visited much of Europe, Central America, and Mexico at various times. Crawford studied at the Cenas Institute for Young Ladies and McDonogh High School No. 3, and was briefly enrolled, in 1895, at Newcomb College. She evinced no special talent in drawing or painting in early life, and her formal study of art did not begin until later in life, when she enrolled in classes at the school of the Arts and Crafts Club of New Orleans in the 1920s. Friends of her later years claimed that she had had no formal education at all. Crawford spent the winter of 1927–28 in Paris, studying with André Lhote; in the spring she continued her studies, traveling to Vienna and working at the Kunstgewerbeschule. In Europe she entered the Cubist scene in Paris and became friends with and was mentored by Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and others. She then returned home to New Orleans and continued to paint and exhibit, with her first solo show coming in 1928. The following year saw her exhibiting in New York, at the Montross Gallery, where she and Charles Bain were singled out for praise from a local critic; she continued showing her art regionally and in New York and Philadelphia for the next decade. She won much critical acclaim and a number of local prizes; she also created work for the Public Works of Art Project of the New Deal. Because her work was far too avant garde for New Orleans at that time, after she returned to Louisiana she did most of her painting in private and much of it was not discovered until after her death.Petteys, Chris, \\"Dictionary of Women Artists: An international dictionary of women artists born before 1900\\", G.K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1985 Following their discovery, many of these works were given permanent mountings and presented to the public for the first time. For much of her life, Crawford lived with her stepsister Louise Crawford in the house on Royal Street, a building in which Lyle Saxon also had an apartment. In the 1940s, however, she was forced to leave after developing cancer; she then moved in with a sister in the Garden District. Crawford died in New Orleans in 1952; her brother later donated a large collection of personal effects, including sketchbooks, personal papers, and poetry as well as many artworks, to The Historic New Orleans Collection. The Delgado Museum, today the New Orleans Museum of Art, held an exhibit of her work, \\"The World of Josephine Crawford\\", in 1965. A biography, Josephine Crawford: An Artist’s Vision, was released in 2009. ==Work== Crawford's style, rather than being grounded in realism, bordered on the abstract, in contrast to the Impressionism-derived style which was prominent in New Orleans for much of her early life. Characteristically her palette is muted, lending a quiet quality to her work. Her Cubist-inspired style, developed after her French sojourn, later gave way to a more fluid and expressive technique, which came to full flower in the watercolors and gouaches she produced in the 1930s. Her style continued to mature, becoming ever more minimalist by the end of her career. Crawford's most unusual work was a series of eight large portraits of family members, created from photographs and painted on the wallpaper of the parlor at her house, which she used as her studio; these pieces, in which a few inches of the patterned wallpaper are allowed to serve as a pictorial border, are reminiscent of the work of Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani. They were among the pieces donated by her brother after her death; they were carefully removed from the walls after the house sustained damage in Hurricane Betsy, and later remounted for exhibition. Critic George Jordan has described Crawford as \\"one of the most experimental painters of the New South between 1900 and 1950.\\" Her works can be found in: * Morris Museum of Art, Augusta, Georgia * Historic New Orleans Collection ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Artists from New Orleans Category:American women painters Category:Modern painters Category:Painters from Louisiana Category:20th- century American painters Category:American people of French descent Category:American people of Northern Ireland descent Category:People of the New Deal arts projects Category:20th-century American women artists ","title":"Josephine Crawford"},{"id":"46390657","text":"Micah Johnson may refer to: *Micah Johnson (baseball) (born 1990), baseball player *Micah Johnson (gridiron football) (born 1988), gridiron football player *Micah Johnson (journalist), broadcast journalist *Micah Xavier Johnson ( 1991–2016), perpetrator of the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers ","title":"Micah Johnson"},{"id":"46390664","text":"Vladimír Vondráček (22 May 1949) is a Czech former cyclist.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and also occurs in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. ==Description== Parasagitta setosa grows to a maximum length of , its tail being up to a quarter of this length. It is a thin, transparent, flexible worm with two pairs of rounded lateral fins composed completely of ray-like structures. There are eight to nine curved grasping hooks on the head. The teeth are in two rows, with six to eight in the front row and ten to sixteen at the back. The eyes have a star-shaped segment spot and the collarette is small or not present at all. The seminal vesicles are very near the posterior fins which are separated from the caudal fin. ==Distribution== Parasagitta setosa is a common neritic species forming part of the plankton in waters less than about 200 metres deep. It occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It is the most common arrow worm in the North Sea and Black Sea, occurring in great drifts in July and August in the Black Sea and from September to November in the North Sea. It is also found in the Baltic Sea when influxes of saline water flow in from the Kattegat. ==Ecology== Parasagitta setosa is one of a number of marine animals that make large vertical migrations on a daily basis. During the day it is found in deep waters but in the late afternoon or early evening it rises to the upper waters, usually spending the night just below the thermocline, and descending again to the depths in early morning. Parasagitta setosa is abundant in many pelagic waters and is an important part of the food chain. It is a predator and consumes about 85% of its bodyweight each day. It feeds on copepods, Oikopleura and smaller P. setosa. It is itself consumed by larger organisms such as the comb jelly Pleurobrachia pileus. The abundance in any area of P. setosa and other mezo-zooplankton, can be easily disturbed by the introduction of an alien species. The arrival of the siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica in the North Sea and of the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi in the Black Sea in the 1980s both had dramatic effects. In the Black Sea, the population of the once abundant P. setosa plummeted, and the anchovy stocks collapsed. The explosive population rises of the invasive species slowed when the animals they fed on became depleted, and afterwards there were wild swings in the populations of these species as a balance of predators and prey developed. ==References== Category:Chaetognatha Category:Animals described in 1847 ","title":"Parasagitta setosa"},{"id":"46390698","text":"Women's Entrepreneurship Day (WED) is a day on which the work of women entrepreneurs is observed and discussed, held on the nineteenth of November of each year. The inaugural event was held in New York City at the United Nations, with additional events being held simultaneously in several other countries. 144 nations overall recognized the first WED in 2014, which included the presentation of the Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards. The organization behind WED also has an ambassadorship and fellowship program. ==History== Women's Entrepreneurship Day was founded and implemented by Pet Pioneer, Animal Fair Media Founder and Ellis Island Medal of Honor recipient Wendy Diamond, after volunteering with the Adelante Foundation who provides microcredit to low income women while in Honduras. Upon her return to the US she decided she wanted to develop something to help this and similar philanthropic causes. The first day was held on November 19, 2014, and was observed in 144 countries that year. It was described by Fortune Magazine as “a global movement to celebrate and support female founders and shed light on some of their challenges.” Forbes Magazine wrote that the intention was also “to mobilize a global network of female business owners, entrepreneurs and change makers who support and empower this community of women entrepreneurs and their businesses.” November 19 was proclaimed an “official day” by both New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and is celebrated annually at the United Nations and around the globe. The U.S. House of Representatives also annually recognizes the WEDO movement November 19th as “A Day in Honor of Women Entrepreneurs” under the leadership of Congresswoman Grace Meng. ==Inaugural event at the United Nations== Women's Entrepreneurship Day event convenes at the United Nations in New York City including a conference, speakers, and the inaugural Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards.

In May 2013, President Barack Obama nominated her to serve as a Democratic member of the Commission to succeed Elisse Walter. Stein was confirmed by the Senate and started at the SEC in August 2013. Since departing the SEC, Stein has served on the faculty of several law schools, including serving as a Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School, Lecturer-in-Law at University of Pennsylvania Law School, and Director of the AI & Capital Markets Initiative for the Center for Innovation at UC Hastings College of Law. Stein serves on the ten-member Financial Stability Task Force coordinated by the Brookings Institution and University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Following her education, Stein was an associate at the law firm Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering (WilmerHale). Before being appointed to the SEC, Stein was an aide to Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and helped write the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. ==Activities at the SEC== Though soft-spoken in public, Stein has taken aggressive stances behind the scenes in pushing for strict investor protection rules at SEC. Stein sparked a debate at the SEC and in Congress over the routine issuance of waivers to companies that had previously been sanctioned by prosecutors for financial misconduct. In April 2014, Stein published a lengthy dissent to an SEC corporate waiver granted to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), which had previously been charged by the Justice Department with criminal violations. Stein argued that the SEC waiver for RBS risked establishing a policy \\"that some firms are just too big to bar.\\" The dissent won applause from Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren. Again in an April 2015 speech, Warren criticized the SEC's policy of granting \\"Well-Known Seasoned Issuer\\" waivers, saying the agency misses an opportunity to deter bad behavior when it rubber-stamps these waivers. But Republicans at the SEC have bristled at the use of waivers as another enforcement tool. Stein has subsequently dissented to SEC waivers granted to BNP Paribas, Citigroup, and Oppenheimer & Co. == References == Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Living people Category:Members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Category:Yale College alumni Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kara Stein"},{"id":"46390815","text":"Brighton General Hospital is an acute general hospital on Elm Grove in Brighton, East Sussex.

Clark was the daughter of Edward Clark, an attorney in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Cary Freeman Clark, whose great-uncle was Edward Cary Walthall. An only child, she was named for her grandmother, and was called \\"Little Kate\\" to distinguish her from \\"Mama Kate\\". Soon after her birth her father purchased a plantation which would later become the centerpiece of the town of Cary, named for his wife. Kate and her mother summered in Holly Springs, where the air was considered cleaner than along the Mississippi Delta, and Edward would write his daughter long letters during these absences. Edward Clark died of pneumonia in 1885, soon after being named assistant to L. Q. C. Lamar, Edward Walthall's former law partner who had been named Grover Cleveland's Secretary of the Interior. At his death Kate and her mother moved to Freeman Place in Holly Springs, which had been the Walthall family residence. The family soon moved to New York City, where Kate attended finishing school at the Gardiner School, from which she graduated in 1891. In 1893 the two went to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which fired in the young woman a passion for art. Upon returning to New York City, she enrolled in the Art Students League in 1894; there she studied drawing with John Henry Twachtman and watercolor with Irving Ramsay Wiles. It was Wiles who introduced her to William Merritt Chase, who would teach her still-life and plein air painting and would serve as her mentor until his death in 1916. The tidy watercolor medium was often used by women at the era, but upon witnessing Chase paint in oil while outfitted in a white flannel suit, Clark took up his favored medium. Chase respected her work highly, choosing two of her paintings for his personal collection. Clark and her mother summered on eastern Long Island during the late 1890s; Cary also traveled to Washington, D.C. for the social season there in 1896, in which year Kate attended classes at the Corcoran School of Art. She also attended the New York School of Art and the Shinnecock School of Art; she would remain in New York for the winters while traveling to resort areas in Vermont and Connecticut in summers. Clark took to signing her works with \\"Freeman Clark\\" or \\"K. Freeman Clark\\" so that her gender was not immediately apparent. She began exhibiting, showing her work at the National Academy of Design in 1905. Further exhibitions followed, at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and at the National Academy and Society of American Artists in New York. She was the subject of a number of one-woman shows, and spoke to the Macbeth Gallery to discuss selling her paintings through them. Clark had returned to Mississippi sporadically over her career to attend to family obligations, but she spent the bulk of her artistic life in New York; only two paintings on Mississippi subjects are known to exist. However, in 1924, after over 20 years in New York Clark returned to Mississippi and her southern roots, leaving the art world behind forever. Her reasons are unknown, but it has been speculated that the death of her mentor Chase in 1916, followed by that of her grandmother in 1919 and her mother in 1922, was a blow from which she never recovered. Chase's death especially seems to have hit her hard; she was pained that she could not attend the auction of his studio effects in time to purchase some memento of him, most especially an old, black kettle which he had painted numerous times and which was sold for seven dollars to somebody else. Clark also appears to have foreseen the rise in modernism which followed the Armory Show. Her family is known to have been against her career, and warned her against operating, as her uncle Russell Freeman wrote her, \\"in spheres of life which belong to men\\". Her temperament has been described as \\"depressive\\", which may have contributed to her withdrawal from the art world. Clark never married; her one serious suitor, Hamilton Foley, was a West Point cadet who went to the Philippines during the Spanish–American War and was court-martialed for embezzlement in 1905. She rarely spoke of her artwork upon her return to Holly Springs. At her death, however, she bequeathed several hundred paintings and drawings, which had been held in storage in the Lincoln Warehouse in New York, to the town, along with her house and with money to build a museum to house the art. These works provided the backbone for the Kate Freeman Clark Museum in Holly Springs.Petteys, Chris, Dictionary of Women Artists: An International Dictionary of Women Artists Born Before 1900, G.K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1985 The museum, which apart from a handful of pieces by Chase contains only her work, is located next to her former home, and with more than 1,000 of her paintings is believed to be the largest collection of paintings by a single artist anywhere in the world. She had envisioned library space and a room for the display of fashions in the museum as well, but these could not be included in the final design due to a lack of funds. Clark is buried at Hillcrest Cemetery in Holly Springs.

Paxton took third place in the 1874 Open Championship. In total, Paxton had five top-10 performances in the Open Championship between 1874 and 1883. ==Early life== Paxton was born in Musselburgh, Scotland, circa 1851. He had a younger brother, Peter, who was also a professional golfer. ==Golf career== The 1874 Open Championship The 1874 Open Championship was the 14th Open Championship, held 10 April at Musselburgh Links, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland. The winner of the Championship was Mungo Park, by two strokes from runner-up Tom Morris, Jr. This was the first Open Championship played at Musselburgh. Paxton—who finished third—played very consistently, carding rounds of 40-40-42-40=162 and won £3 (£ today). Details of play Play started at about 12 noon in dull and showery weather but later in the day the weather improved. The course, especially the greens, \\"were rather heavy\\". Many of the spectators followed Tom Morris, Jr. and Willie Park, Sr. who were paired together. Morris—who got off to a rough start—experienced difficulties in extricating his ball from a number of bunkers. Park scored 40 in the first round to Morris's 42. However, as the day progressed, Morris began to find fairways and improved while Park fell away. The best player in the first two rounds was Mungo Park with scores of 37 and 38. At this stage he led by 4 from G. McCachnie, 5 from George Paxton with Tom Morris, Jr., and Willie Park had fallen a full 8 shots behind. Mungo Park carded a third round 43 with G. McCachnie, George Paxton, Jamie Anderson and Tom Morris, Jr. each four behind at that stage. Bob Martin was a further shot behind after a third round 38. Mungo Park scored 41 in his final round and although Morris again played a useful round he still finished two behind. McCachnie fell away with a closing 47. A staff writer for the Glasgow Herald wrote, \\"During the last round the utmost excitement prevailed, and as each couple came in a knot of spectators gathered round them to ascertain what luck had attended them.\\" ==Death and legacy== The date of death of Paxton is unknown. Paxton is best remembered for having five top-10 finishes (four of which were top-5) in the Open Championship. ==Results in The Open Championship== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 !1878 !1879 !1880 !1881 !1882 !1883 - The Open Championship align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 align=\\"center\\" style=DNP align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 align=\\"center\\" style=DNP align=\\"center\\" style=DNP align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"4 align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T4 align=\\"center\\" style=DNP align=\\"center\\" style=DNP align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 } *Note: Paxton played only in The Open Championship.

After some sixty minutes of highly incredible melodramatic incident, the government's prized 'inertia projector' is rescued from foreign hands and the saboteurs are either killed off or jailed. (The 'inertia projector' is an instrument which fouls electric current at the source; its amazing practicality is illustrated when it is focused on the plane in which the enemy agents attempt to flee the country.) Mr. Reagan, who had seen service previously with the Warners' FBI force, handles his role of counter-espionage agent with the customary daring. Eddie Foy Jr. has a few good comical moments, and Lya Lys of the golden tresses makes an attractive Mata Hari. The screen play by Raymond Schrock is compact, if not 'original', and the direction by Lewis Seiler is swiftly paced.

The site fell into disrepair and since the mid-1980s has been repurposed for community facilities. It is a Grade I listed building. ==History== The building of the guildhall John Foulston's Town Hall, Column and Library in Devonport, . The guildhall, which was designed by John Foulston in the Regency style with Greek Doric features, was completed between 1821 and 1824. Foulston designed a cluster of four buildings together in the area: the Guildhall, Column and Oddfellow's Hall still stand today whilst his Mount Zion Calvinist Chapel is now lost. The area of Devonport was then called Plymouth Dock and the presence of the Royal Navy brought prosperity to the area. A petition was taken to King George IV, who granted permission for the area to be called Devonport in 1824. Devonport Guildhall was home to the magistrates court and the Mayor's Parlour and also was used for social events (the courtroom had removable fixtures to hold events and balls in the evening). There were cells and a mortuary, and a police station at the rear of the building. It was also the meeting place of the county borough of Devonport established under the Local Government Act 1888. Decline and refurbishment The building fell into disrepair when the Three Towns of Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse amalgamated in 1914 and municipal functions were transferred to the expanded City of Plymouth. Still utilised for the city, the building had a variety of uses, including as a gas- mask collection point during the Second World War. After it fell into neglect, Guildhall restorations were attempted – notably in 1986 when it reopened as a Citizen's Advice Bureau, Library, a playgroup, cafe and sports hall – but failed to survive due to the sheer size of the building. In 2009, Real Ideas Organisation was awarded a £1.75 million Community Assets Grant, with which they embarked on the careful and painstaking restoration of Devonport Guildhall to its former glory. Working closely with Plymouth City Council and the former Devonport Regeneration Community Partnership, RIO renovated Devonport Guildhall with the local community in mind. The building, which is run by a social enterprise, re-opened in 2010. retrieved 12 April 2015 ==See also== * Guild ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Jenkins, Frank (1968). \\"John Foulston and His Public Buildings in Plymouth, Stonehouse, and Devonport\\".

It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715-1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands, and it was originally called Salina Right Redoubt. Two warehouses were grafted on the redoubt in the second half of the 18th century so as to store salt from nearby salt pans. It was eventually renamed after Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada, whose coat of arms can be seen on one of the warehouses. The redoubt and warehouses have been recently restored. ==History== Ximenes Redoubt eventually became a warehouse storing salt from the nearby Salina salt pans Redoubt entrance Salina Right Redoubt was built between 1715 and 1716 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of coastal fortifications. It was one of two redoubts defending Salina Bay. The redoubt on the other side of the bay, known as Perellos Redoubt, was demolished after World War II. The redoubt was unique in Malta, as it was the only one which consisted of just a polygonal enclosure with a high parapet wall designed to protect infantrymen. It did not have a blockhouse, which was a feature found in most other redoubts in the Maltese islands. Since it was a small work, it only cost 316 scudi, 9 tari, 10 grani and 2 piccoli to build, which was less than one third the cost of an average redoubt. After 1741, two fougasses were built, one within the redoubt and another just outside its wall. One of the fougasses still survives today, and it is among the best preserved ones to be found in Malta. In about 1750, a large building was grafted onto the redoubt. It served as both a magazine and a warehouse, to serve as storage space for salt from the nearby salt pans at Salina. A second warehouse was built in the 1770s, during the reign of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. The new warehouse had a large escutcheon with Ximenes' coat of arms above the doorway, and the redoubt became known as the Ximenes Redoubt. The redoubt did not have any armament, equipment or munitions in 1785. ==Present day== Today, the redoubt lies on the Baħar iċ- Ċagħaq–Salina coast road, and it is overshadowed by the Coastline Hotel. The redoubt as well as the nearby salt pans were restored between 2011 and 2013. In 2013, the redoubt was vandalized when graffiti were sprayed on one of its walls. This has since been removed. ==References *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands *YouTube video about Ximenes Redoubt Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:Naxxar Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Warehouses in Malta Category:Salt production Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ","title":"Ximenes Redoubt"},{"id":"46391274","text":"Callirhoe involucrata is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family known by the common name purple poppy-mallow.

When it is directed at another person (called stone pelting in India), it is often considered a form of criminal assault. ==History== Throwing of rocks or stones is one of the most ancient forms of ranged-weapon combat, with slings used to increase the range of such projectiles having been found among other weapons in the tomb of Tutankhamen, who died about 1325 BC.Image of sling from the Tomb of Tutankhamen . In many places, rocks are readily available as weapons, more so than more sophisticated weapons. Because rocks are dense, hard objects, a forcefully thrown rock can do substantial damage to a target, particularly if the rock has sharp or jagged edges. Xenophon in his work titled Hellenica mentions the petrovoloi (), meaning stone-throwers in Greek, as an army unit.Xenophon, Hellenica, § 2.4.12A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875, Funda De re militari (Latin \\"Concerning Military Matters\\") by the Roman writer Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus details Roman soldiers training to throw stones as weapons. \\"Recruits are to be taught the art of throwing stones both with the hand and sling.\\" And \\"Formerly all soldiers were trained to the practice of throwing stones of a pound weight with the hand, as this was thought a readier method since it did not require a sling.\\" Translated from the Latin by Lieutenant John Clarke Historically, stoning was used as a method of human execution in several cultures. In the 18th century, William Blackstone stated that throwing stones in a town or city on a highway, when it caused a death, was to be defined as manslaughter rather than murder.Sir William Blackstone, A Summary of the Constitutional Laws of England Being an Abridgement of Blackstone's Commentaries, John Trusler 1796 pp.175–176John Burnett, Robert Craigie A treatise on various branches of the criminal law of Scotland, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1811 p.30 In the 19th century, \\"stone throwing\\" was defined as a \\"nuisance\\", one of a number of offenses such as \\"kite-flying\\" and \\"doorbell ringing\\" to be handled by bylaws which differed from town to town.Steve Sturdy, Medicine, Health and the Public Sphere in Britain, 1600–2000, Routledge 2013 p.194. ==Laws== Rock throwing during riots is a criminal offense, for which rock throwers can be charged with felony crimes, including assault on a law enforcement officer. Incidents of criminal rock throwing have resulted in arrests during sports riots; especially notable are incidents of rock-throwing football hooliganism. Australia Section 49A of the Crimes Act provides a maximum 5-year prison sentence for \\"throwing rocks and other objects at vehicles and vessels\\". India Throwing of stones at Indian Armed Forces and Police is frequent in the Indian province of Kashmir. Usually carried out by youths, in the local language it is called \\"Kanni Jung\\", which means fighting with stones and the stone pelters are called as Sangbaaz. There are claims that the rocks are thrown in response to killings of Kashmiri separatists at the hands of forces. New Zealand Individuals who throw rocks at cars can serve 14 years for endangering transport. Turkey Turkey presses charges and imposes prison sentences for the crime of being part of a group throwing stones at police, even when the rock-throwers are 15 years of age and younger. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) introduced a range of legal measures criminalizing both Kurdish political claims and protest activities by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The harsh sentences handed down against stone-throwing children (taş atan çocuklar) led to a public outcry and to an amendment reducing the length of the sentences on the grounds that it was inappropriate from \\"a criminal justice point of view.\\"Cengiz Gunes, Welat Zeydanlioglu, The Kurdish Question in Turkey: New Perspectives on Violence, Representation and Reconciliation, Routledge, 2013 United Kingdom Expansive legislation on public disorder introduced in 1986 allows stone throwers to be sentenced on average to years in prison if the criminal justice system can prove that the action took place in a riot.Yasmin Hussain, Dr Paul Bagguley, Riotous Citizens: Ethnic Conflict in Multicultural Britain, Ashgate Publishing, 2008 pp. 9, 128 United States In the U.S., charges vary by state. Depending upon the facts and jurisdiction, potential charges could include disorderly conduct, assault, and battery. In the United States individuals throwing rocks at another person can be arrested and charged with assault, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct. As a 15-year-old, actor Mark Wahlberg was charged in 2 separate incidents of throwing rocks and shouting racial epithets at African-American children. Rock-throwing can be a felony and rock-throwers could face criminal charges, dependent on the circumstances that may include second degree murder, aggravated assault, throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment of life, and aggravated assault with a lethal weapon. Punishment upon conviction varies as with all punishments for all crimes. A Florida judge sentenced a teenager to serve life in prison for murder by throwing rocks at cars. A New England judge, ruling on teenagers convicted of throwing stones at the windows of passing trains that resulted in eye injuries to passengers, sentenced the convicted to be kept in an eye-injury ward of a hospital for two weeks with their eyes bandaged to make them understand the consequence of their delinquency.Joel Feinberg, Harmless Wrongdoing, Oxford University Press, 1988 p.295. Rock throwers can be charged, tried, and convicted even when no injuries or damage result. Under American law they can receive very long sentences and even be sentenced to life in prison. Under American law, individuals who were part of a group engaged in rock-throwing can be convicted and imprisoned even if they did not personally throw any missiles. Vietnam Youths convicted of \\"vandalism and battery\\" for throwing stones at vehicles have been imprisoned. ==Contexts== Rock-throwing may occur in a variety of contexts but is often associated with assaultive offenses, demonstrations and riots, and international conflicts. At people Rock-throwing can be used by thieves, as was demonstrated by a 2015 case in India in which Ratan Marwadi, 45, was charged with throwing rocks at a random passer-by, Darshana Pawar, to disable and rob her. Pawar was killed by Ratan Marwadi, who had served time in jail for pelting rail commuters with stones with the intent of robbing them. Vehicles Motor vehicles Rocks thrown at cars moving along highways at high speeds have been a problem in a number of countries. According to the Austin, Texas, police detective Jarrett Crippen, \\"When we’re talking about highway speeds of 60, 70 mph, that rock is hitting you full- force.... If it's coming through your windshield, it can cause serious damage to the body, vehicle or even death.\\" A Washington State trooper said of an arrest of criminal rock-throwers, \\"Any one of these rocks could have punctured a windshield, hit the driver in the face and killed them.\\" Although the rocks are often thrown from overpasses or high points along the roadside, people riding in cars have also been killed by rocks thrown at random vehicles from passing cars. Thrown rocks can kill in a number of ways; a rock can hit a passenger directly in the head with lethal force, a rock can strike the driver causing him or her to lose control of the car and crash, the \\"jolt and shock of a barrage of stones smashing against the front windshield\\" can cause the driver to lose control and crash, or the out-of-control vehicle can slam into a passing car and cause it to crash.Rafael Medoff, 'Baltimore ‘riot mom’ needed in Jerusalem,' JNS.org 3 May 2015 Notable instances of death and injury caused by rocks thrown at cars include the death of Julie Catherine Laible, a professor at the University of Alabama, the Darmstadt American rock-throwing incident in which American teenagers killed a 20-year-old woman and critically injured her grandmother, then hit another car, killing the 41-year-old mother of 2 small children, the death of Chris Currie, 20, on a road in New Zealand, the Killing of David Wilkie by striking miners throwing rocks at cars in the United Kingdom, and the I-80 rock throwing in which youths hurled rocks from an overpass on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania, critically injuring and permanently disfiguring a passenger. In 2017, a single American highway, Interstate 75, was the scene of 2017 Interstate 75 rock-throwing deaths in two separate incidents. Trains Throwing rocks at trains has long been a problem in countries including the United States and New Zealand, where passengers and train crews have been injured by large rocks thrown through windows. Protests and riots Rock throwers at a 2007 anti-Sarkozy demonstration in Paris. Rock-throwing has been in the past often adopted as a method by an unarmed population to protest a governing power's authority. Under English common law, soldiers were not permitted to shoot at civilians engaged in that kind of protest unless their lives were in danger or they had obtained an express order from a civil magistrate. > At one point, when town officials tried to arrest a British officer who was > commanding the guard at Boston Neck, Captain Ponsonby Molesworth intervened > to confront a stone-throwing crowd. Molesworth ordered the soldiers to > bayonet anyone throwing stones who got too close. A Boston justice told him > that, under common law, a bayonet thrust was not an act of self-defense > against a stone, which was not a lethal weapon. Had a soldier killed anyone, > Molesworth could have been tried for his life.'John Murrin, Paul Johnson, > James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, : Liberty, Equality, Power: A > History of the American People, Cengage Learning, 2011 p.183 Political demonstrations in many countries have resulted with the arrest of violent protestors for throwing rocks and other objects at police. Many notorious and deadly riots have begun with or included rock-throwing as violence escalated, including the Toronto Jubilee riots, the Boston Massacre, and the 2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots in Ukraine. International borders United States – Mexico Rock-throwers on the Mexican side of the border between the United States and Mexico frequently target US Border Patrol agents with barrages of rocks to prevent them from apprehending individuals illegally crossing the border, particularly smugglers moving illegal drugs or illegal migrants across the border. Between 2010 and 2014, Border Patrol agents were assaulted with rocks 1,700 times and fired weapons at rock throwers 43 times, resulting in 10 deaths. Border Patrol agents are permitted to respond to rock- throwers with lethal weapons, but as of 2014, the policy is to attempt to avoid finding themselves in situations in which responding to rock-throwing with lethal force becomes necessary. Spain – Morocco In recent years, increasing numbers of undocumented sub-Saharan Africans have passed through Morocco attempting to reach European Union countries, and many attempt to enter Spanish soil at two Spanish enclaves, Melilla and Ceuta, on the African side of the Mediterranean Sea. On several occasions, Moroccan and Spanish border authorities have defended lethal violence against African illegal immigrants near the Melilla border fence and Ceuta border fence by asserting that groups of migrants attempting to storm the border in mass-entry events had thrown rocks to drive border guards away from the gates. Egypt – Gaza Stone throwing rioters have repeatedly clashed with Egyptian troops at the Egypt-Gaza border. * In 2008, Gazans assaulted Egyptian border guards by throwing barrages of rocks over the low concrete border wall topped with barbed wire, tore down a section of the wall, and opened a road and moving goods and people across for several hours before the Egyptian Army, without using lethal force, managed to regain control of the border. * On 6 January 2010, Hamas called on Gazans to protest the Egyptian border blockade. Gazan men responded by massing at the border and throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at the Egyptian security forces, who responded with gunfire. Hungary – Serbia In the 2015 Horgoš riot during the European migrant crisis, illegal immigrants at the Hungarian southern border fence threw rocks and chunks of concrete at Hungarian border police. ==Prevention== In Florida, statewide policy is to install fences on highly trafficked overpasses and those near schools. An exception is Manatee County, where all overpasses have it due to a rock-throwing death in 1999. == See also == * Serhildan * Jewish Israeli stone throwing * Palestinian stone throwing * Egging * Acid throwing ==References== Category:Assault Category:Violence Category:Protest tactics ","title":"Stone throwing"},{"id":"46391383","text":"Mixin' It Up is the seventh studio album by American soul-disco group, The Trammps, released in 1980 through Atlantic Records. ==Commercial performance== The album features the single \\"Hard Rock and Disco\\", which peaked at No. 76 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. ==Track listingPersonnel== ;The Trammps *Earl Young *Harold Wade *Stanley Wade *Robert Upchurch *Jimmy Ellis ;Additional Personnel *Norman Harris, T.J.

It was the 42nd staging of the tournament and the fifth successive time it was held at the Alexandra Palace. The defending champion Shaun Murphy lost 4–6 against Mark Allen in the first round. Murphy forfeited the sixth frame of the match by missing a red on three consecutive occasions. The quarter-final between Judd Trump and Neil Robertson produced six century breaks, setting a new record for the most centuries in an 11-frame match. These included the two highest breaks of the tournament, 140 from Trump and 139 from Robertson. The match was singled out for particular praise, with John Virgo calling it one of the greatest in Masters history. Playing in his first major televised tournament since taking an eight-month hiatus from professional snooker, Ronnie O'Sullivan reached his eleventh Masters final and won the tournament for a sixth time, equalling Stephen Hendry's record for the most Masters titles. Losing only the first frame, he defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1, the biggest winning margin since Steve Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0 in 1988, and the first time a player had won ten consecutive frames in a Masters final. ==Field== Defending champion Shaun Murphy was the number 1 seed with World Champion Stuart Bingham seeded 2.

It was demolished after the Second World War. ==History== Boathouses built on the site of the redoubt Perellos Redoubt was built between 1715 and 1716 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of coastal fortifications. It was one of two redoubts defending Salina Bay. The redoubt on the other side of the bay, known as Ximenes Redoubt, is still intact. The redoubt was named after Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful. The redoubt consisted of a pre- existing mandrague which was converted into a blockhouse, and a rectangular enclosure with a high parapet wall designed to protect infantrymen. The latter was similar to the design of Ximenes Redoubt, but it also had a small bastion on a corner of its perimeter wall. After 1741, a fougasse was built inside the redoubt. In 1785 it did not have any armament, equipment or munitions. A concrete beach post was built over the remains of the redoubt in World War II. The remains were demolished after the war, and the site of the redoubt is now occupied by boat houses. The fougasse possibly still exists buried under these boat houses. ==References *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:St. Paul's Bay Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 20th century Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ","title":"Perellos Redoubt"},{"id":"46391501","text":"Werner Hofmann (2010) Werner Hofmann (August 8, 1928 in Vienna - 13 March 2013 in Hamburg) was an Austrian art historian, cultural journalist, writer, curator and museum director, who is \\"considered by his colleagues as one of the most distinguished European scholars of modern art and its ideology.\\"\\"Werner Hofmann To Speak On Art\\", The Stanford Daily, Volume 145, Issue 56, May 13, 1964. ==Life and work== Hofmann was the son of Leopold Hofmann and Anna Visvader. From 1947 to 1949, he studied art history at the universities of Vienna and Paris, where he completed a Ph.D. dissertation on the \\"Graphische Gestaltungsweise von Honoré Daumier\\". From 1950 to 1955 he worked as an assistant at the Albertina in Vienna. At that time, he was also a visiting professor at Barnard College, Columbia University in New York. In 1960, he published his groundbreaking study on 19th-century European art, Das Irdische Paradies: Kunst im 19. Jahrhundert, which was soon translated into English. In it, he explained 19th-century art out of its opposing themes rather than in a chronological manner. In 1964 he was a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1962, Hofmann was the founding director of Vienna's Museum of the 20th Century, which he ran until 1969 - today mumok (Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien). From 1969 to 1990 he was director of the Hamburger Kunsthalle. From 1981 to 1982, he held a visiting professorship at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hofmann curated famous \\"Kunst um 1800\\" exhibitions at the Hamburger Kunsthalle on Caspar David Friedrich, Philipp Otto Runge, William Blake, Henry Fuseli, John Flaxman, J. M. W. Turner and Francisco de Goya and also exhibitions on contemporary artists such as Franz Erhard Walther, Joseph Beuys and Georg Baselitz, which are \\"regarded as milestones in the history of exhibitions at the Hamburger Kunsthalle and for German art museums.\\"\\"Werner Hofmann gestorben\\", art: Das Kunstmagazin, March 14, 2013 Hofmann is known for having connected two schools of art history: the Vienna School with the Hamburg School. According to the Dictionary of Art Historians, his \\"work was highly interdisciplinary, drawing examples from music, philosophy and literature to elucidate what were in many cases well-known works of art in new ways. This non-linear, a-historical (but not anti-historical) view of art history influenced a generation of modernist art historians who viewed their art works thematically rather than as a series of style changes.\\" Still full of energy and having a new project on \\"Kunstkammern\\" and Julius von Schlosser's work on the same subject in mind, Hofmann died of a heart attack in a hospital.Martin Warnke, \\"Werner Hofmann\\", Die Zeit, March 21, 2013. == Awards == * 1990: Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres * 1991: Sigmund-Freud-Preis für wissenschaftliche Prosa * 1992: Preis der Stadt Wien für Geisteswissenschaften * 2008: Aby Warburg Prize ==Select publications== * Die Karikatur von Leonardo bis Picasso.

Tian hailed from the Plain Yellow Banner of the Han Chinese military under the Qing Dynasty command. He was schooled in the Imperial Academy, and became a county official at the age of 21. In the last years of Kangxi's reign, Tian worked as a scholar in the imperial palace. It is not clear how his relationship with Yongzheng began. In 1734 after Yongzheng ascended the throne Tian was named governor of Henan, and was promoted to Governor-General (zongdu) several years later. He then served as Governor- General of Shandong, then Governor General of Beihe (). Yongzheng held Tian in very high regard, writing that Tian devoted his life to serving the court and the state, and was morally upright and just. Tian retired in 1730, citing fatigue and illness. Tian was interred at the Western Qing tombs, a very special honour, given that the tombs were generally reserved for royalty. ==Popular culture== The 1998 hit TV series Yongzheng Dynasty depicted Tian as Yongzheng's foremost trusty fixer and lieutenant, being sent by Yongzheng to complete several missions in the south during flooding in the region. In the show, Tian's work in the south is used as a pretext for the eighth prince Yunsi to criticize the policies of Yongzheng. Historically, Wu Sidao () or \\"Mr. Wu\\" actually served on the staff of Tian, but in the television series he was shown as Yongzheng's personal advisor prior to being recommended to Tian on advice from Li Wei. Tian also appeared in the 2002 TV series Grain Storage () as a negative character. ==References== Category:1662 births Category:1732 deaths Category:Political office-holders in Shanxi Category:Political office- holders in Henan Category:Han Chinese Plain Yellow Bannermen ","title":"Tian Wenjing"},{"id":"46391586","text":"Lady Chen (; 2nd century) was the wife of Eastern Han Xiao of Bohai (The grandson of Emperor Zhang of Han), and the biological mother of Liu Zuan who became Emperor Zhi of Han.

Using a ventral fin with a long tail skid to protect the propeller and a short vertical stabilizer, the C 1 had no fixed horizontal stabilizer. Its tricycle landing gear and advanced metal fuselage were also unusual for its era. Designed to have an unrestricted forward field of fire, the fuselage also had two large circular windows on each side for downward visibility. Armament consisted of a single 37mm cannon.

It is located in an architecturally distinguished Colonial Revival building, designed by Ball and Dabney and built in 1892-93, that also functions as a community meeting space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. ==Architecture and history== The Sorrento Library is set on the south side of Waukeag Avenue, about west of its junction with Maine State Route 185. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, wood shingle exterior, and a granite foundation. The north- facing main facade is distinguished by a porte-cochere sheltering its entrance, and an arcaded porch that extends across the width and around the sides. The roof above is pierced by three gabled dormers, the center one large and containing three wide sash windows, the central one topped by a half-round window. Inside, the main floor is divided into two large spaces, separated by a large stone fireplace. The first space encountered from the entrance is the larger, and has a gallery above which is accessed by stairs near the entrance. The space to the rear, originally a reading room, has been converted into an apartment. The development of Sorrento was begun as a speculative venture in the 1880s by businessmen seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the area as evidenced by the success of nearby Bar Harbor. A hotel and a number of elegant summer \\"cottages\\" were built by the early 1890s, and rail and steamship service to the area was arranged by Frank Jones, president of the Boston and Maine Railroad and one of the venture's major investors. Jones was also probably responsible for the separation of Sorrento from adjacent Sullivan in 1895. His wife donated the funds for construction of the library, which was designed by the Boston firm of Ball and Dabney and completed in 1893. The library, although open to the public, remained the property of the Joneses until 1918, when it was turned over to the Sorrento Village Improvement Association, which has managed the building since. The interior of its main hall was altered in the 1930s by the removal of posts to increase the amount of space available for dances. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine ==References== Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Maine Category:Infrastructure completed in 1892 Category:Buildings and structures in Hancock County, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Sorrento Library"},{"id":"46391712","text":"Willie Thomson (born ) was a Scottish professional golfer who played during the late 19th century. ==Early life== Thomson was born in Scotland . ==Golf career== In total, Thomson had three top-10 finishes in The Open Championship.

Actor Paddy Considine, another friend of Meadows, was briefly in a band with Clark. Clark and Dillon went on to form the group Sunhouse with guitarist Paul Bacon and bassist Rob Brooks. Sunhouse released one album, the critically acclaimed Crazy on the Weekend in 1998 but split in 1999. Clark then went on to form the band Clayhill in 2003 with guitarist Ted Barnes and bassist Ali Friend. They released a number of EPs and three albums before splitting in 2007. Clark had more or less given up music by then and was considering working as a pizza delivery man. With the support of long term friend Meadows, who showcased his work in the 2007 documentary The Living Room, Clark began working again. Notably several appearances on albums by UNKLE including End Titles... Stories for Film in 2008 and Where Did the Night Fall in 2010. Clark, who had struggled with alcoholism, died in February 2015 caused by breathing complications associated with the illness. The album Evangelist, featuring his last recordings, was released in October 2015. Incomplete, the songs were finished with the help of James Griffiths (UNKLE/TOYDRUM) and Pablo Clements (UNKLE/TOYDRUM) at the Toy Room Studios, Brighton. The album is loosely based on the singer's life and includes guest appearances by Warren Ellis and Ludovico Einaudi. ==Selected discography== Sunhouse *Crazy on the Weekend (CBS, 1998) Clayhill * Grasscutter EP (Eat Sleep Records, 2004) * Cuban Green EP (Eat Sleep Records, 2004) * Small Circle (Eat Sleep Records, 2004) * Acoustic (Eat Sleep Records, 2005) * Mine at Last (Eat Sleep Records, 2006) * Halfway Across Single (Eat Sleep Records, 2007) Gavin Clark * Somers Town OST (Not on label, 2008) * Beautiful Skeletons (Club AC30, 2014) TOYDRUM * Evangelist (Underscore Collective, 2015) ==References* Category:1969 births Category:2015 deaths Category:English male singers Category:English singer- songwriters ","title":"Gavin Clark"},{"id":"46391729","text":"Furniture preservation is the practice of maintaining the condition of furniture, especially antique or valuable wooden furniture. One of the most significant dangers to wooden furniture is humidity; wood will tend to expand by absorbing water from the air when it is humid, and shrink when the air is drier. This can result in all kinds of damage to the furniture, especially if it has boards which are held in place and cannot move freely (e.g., because they interlock with each other), in which case the boards may degrade, either through compression or by splitting apart. Damage of this kind can be avoided by maintaining consistent relative humidity in the area where the furniture in question is being kept. High relative humidity can even result in mold or insect infestations in wooden furniture. Avoiding exposure to direct sunlight is also important to furniture preservation, as direct sunlight can fade wood or upholstery over time. ==References== Category:Furniture Category:Antiques ","title":"Furniture preservation"},{"id":"46391730","text":"United National Movement may refer to: *United National Movement (Georgia) *United National Movement (Pakistan) *United National Movement (Saint Kitts- Nevis-Anguilla) ","title":"United National Movement"},{"id":"46391802","text":"Appearing with Xaviera Hollander on tv programme After Dark in 1989 Malcolm Alan Bennett (21 September 1958 – 1 March 2015) was a British poet and author.

Not intended to be realistic, it consists of a suit made of only a wooden barrel held on by suspenders, indicating that the subject is so poor that he is unable to afford even clothes. It was a common representation of bankruptcy, appearing in many animated shorts, political cartoons, comedies, and other media. Man wearing a bankruptcy barrel at the Occupy Wall Street protests Will Johnstone's editorial-cartoon character \\"the Tax Payer\\", first published in the New York World-Telegram in 1933 and regularly thererafter, showed the taxpayer reduced to wearing a barrel for clothing. Other cartoonists then copied this theme. Whether Johnstone is the origin of the symbol is not established. Canadian cartoonist John Collins, editorial cartoonist of the Montreal Gazette from 1939 to 1982, commonly used the character \\"Uno Who\\" in his editorial cartoons. Uno Who was almost always shown wearing a bankruptcy barrel, and for much the same reason (high taxes) as Johnstone's taxpayer. The bankruptcy barrel has been used for other meanings such as the January 1989 edition of Esquire magazine which featured Robin Givens on the cover wearing the barrel in a somewhat seductive manner, showing her cleavage partially covered by the barrel and commenting that she was aiming at either going for broke or ending up a millionaire. It was also used in a 1999 Wendy's commercial referring to the dot com bubble where a destitute dot com magnate is left only with a barrel but can still afford a discounted Wendy's hamburger. However, Wendy's founder Dave Thomas (out of desire not to see him remove the barrel to fish for change) offers to pay for the man's meal. However, the use of a barrel as clothing for comedic effect (rather than to necessarily show penury) goes back further; the hapless character is reduced to wearing a barrel for modesty because his clothes have been stolen or some other putatively amusing circumstance has arisen. George Etherege's 1664 comedy The Comical Revenge or, Love in a Tub included a barrel-wearing character. The 1921 film Tol'able David contains a scene with a character wearing a barrel. Moon Mullins was occasionally seen wearing a barrel after losing at cards. A 1987 episode of The Smurfs used it to denote debt, where the villain Gargamel had all his possessions seized to satisfy a debt, only for the collector to remark \\"I will be back for the barrel!\\" In \\"Hollywood Steps Out\\" and the first Captain Underpants book, the barrel is used as a visual euphemism implying that the character is actually naked. ==Drunkard's cloak== The bankruptcy barrel is similar to a drunkard's cloak, an actual punishment seen from medieval times forward (but now obsolete) as a sort of pillory to punish drunkards and other offenders. Depictions of the drunkard's cloak usually show a barrel with a hole cut into the top for the head to pass through at the neck and two small holes cut in the sides for the arms (or just the hands) to pass through. This differs in detail from bankruptcy barrel, which is almost always shown with the top of the barrel at the armpits, the arms free above that, and the barrel held up by two straps passing over the shoulders. ==References== Category:Homelessness in popular culture Category:Visual motifs ","title":"Bankruptcy barrel"},{"id":"46391829","text":"William Forester may refer to: * Sir William Forester (1655–1718), MP for Wenlock 1679–85 and 1689–15 * William Forester (1690–1758), MP for Wenlock 1715–22, 1734–41 and 1754–58 * William A.

After Charlotte insisted that no one deserves a title match, she was scheduled to defend her championship against both women in a Triple Threat Match at WrestleMania. == Reception == Like the previous year's event, Fastlane received generally mixed reviews from critics. Aaron Oster of The Baltimore Sun reviewed the pay-per-view as \\"solid\\", but noted that the show was \\"received so poorly\\" by fans that it led to \\"#CancelWWENetwork trending on Twitter once again\\". Regarding the main event, the fan \\"response has been instantly negative\\" despite a result \\"many expected\\". While the \\"match itself was good for the most part\\", the finish was questioned by Oster: \\"Why was Reigns able to jump right up after he got hit several times with a steel chair?\\" Styles-Jericho was \\"great\\" but Oster also questioned \\"why Chris Jericho was kicking out of the Styles Clash so early into Styles' WWE career.\\" For the women's title match, \\"Brie looked OK\\" but was not on the level of Charlotte's previous opponents, Paige and Becky Lynch. Both the women's tag match and Owens-Ziggler were \\"good\\", with praise for Owens' \\"short-arm pop-up powerbomb\\". Meanwhile, Del Rio's disqualification was a \\"great piece of psychology that added to the match\\" for the U.S. title. Lastly, the Wyatt's loss was a \\"mistake\\" because \\"if they can't beat this thrown-together group, who can they beat?\\" Jason \\"Marbles\\" Powell of ProWrestling.net \\"felt letdown by the overall show until the main event\\". This was in spite of \\"some good matches\\", because the entire Fastlane event failed to leave Powell \\"anxious to see WrestleMania\\", with \\"the Hunter vs. Reigns match just doesn't feel main event worth\\". For the matches, Powell was high on the main event (\\"very good\\" and without \\"a dull moment\\"), Jericho-Styles (\\"good drama down the stretch... Jericho did a really nice job of acting like he was in agony as he sold the Calf Crusher\\") and the Divas Championship bout (\\"an entertaining match with Brie using a lot of her husband’s moves\\"). Additionally, the Wyatts losing was \\"very surprising\\". For the negatives, Powell suffered network streaming issues for the women's tag match and the Intercontinental title match, Edge and Christian's segment \\"was terrible\\", and for Axel-Truth, Powell said, \\"I watched a pay-per-view and a Superstars match broke out\\". James Caldwell of PWTorch.com reviewed the event, with three matches being rated 3.5 out of 5 stars: the main event, Jericho-Styles and Owens-Ziggler. The main event match was described as \\"WWE main event-style roller-coasting with ups-and-downs and twists and turns playing off the TV, but it was inevitable Reigns was winning, taking some of the steam out of the match\\". Caldwell criticized the \\"tone-deaf\\", \\"Super Cena booking\\" of Reigns as WWE failing to change the \\"presentation for a non-main-eventer masquerading in a main event role\\". Styles-Jericho had \\"few slip-ups on big spots\\", but a \\"very good, clear story\\" and \\"a very strong finish\\". Owens-Ziggler and Brie- Charlotte (2 stars) were both described as bouts where \\"the audience didn't really buy the babyface challenger having a shot to win\\". Del Rio-Kalisto was rated 3 stars and the women's tag match 2.5 stars. The six-man tag match was rated 2.25 stars, with Caldwell questioning if the Wyatts needed to resort to \\"another promo/sneak-attack trying to save face after another big loss\\". Caldwell was also negative on Edge and Christian's segment as \\"none of this made any sense from a character alignment perspective\\", as well as the Axel- Truth match for even happening, writing that \\"the PPV has gone off the rails, like a third hour of Raw\\". Dave Scherer of PWInsider.com praised the main event match as \\"really, really good\\", but criticized the match result as Vince McMahon ignoring \\"the voice of the people... especially when the crowd made it really clear that of the two, they wanted Dean\\" over Roman Reigns. Scherer was most positive regarding the Styles-Jericho match, describing it as \\"freaking awesome. AJ did what AJ does and WWE let him do it... And kudos to Jericho for being a veteran stud here\\". For the women's matches, Scherer wrote that the title match \\"could have been the best match I have ever seen Brie have\\", while the tag bout was \\"good, solid\\". The Intercontinental title match was \\"great\\", as was Kevin Owens' performance in it. The United States title match was \\"solid\\", but Scherer criticized \\"how they are booking ADR\\" as \\"wasting him\\". Lastly, Scherer dismissed Edge and Christian's segment as an \\"in show ad\\". == Results  References  External links == * 2016 Category:2016 WWE Network events Category:2016 in Ohio Category:Events in Cleveland Category:Professional wrestling in Cleveland, Ohio Category:2016 WWE pay-per- view events Category:February 2016 events in the United States ","title":"Fastlane (2016)"},{"id":"46391864","text":"Dellia Battery (), also known as Vendôme Battery () or Pwales Right Battery (), was an artillery battery in Xemxija Bay, limits of St. Paul's Bay, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. It was demolished in 1924, but the coats of arms and inscription which were located above the main entrance still exist and are now a monument. ==History== Dellia Battery was built in 1715 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of batteries and redoubts around the coasts of Malta. It was one of two batteries defending Xemxija Bay, the other one being Arrias Battery, which is still in existence. The battery consisted of a mostly rectangular gun platform with a rounded end, ringed by a low parapet. Its gorge was closed off by a rectangular blockhouse. The doorway was surmounted by the coats of arms of the Order, Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful and the Langue of France. The latter represented Philippe de Vendôme, who had a leading role in the construction of batteries in Malta. In 1770, the battery was armed with six 6-pounder iron guns, and was supplied with 420 rounds of roundshot and 90 rounds of grapeshot. Three of its guns were removed by 1785. In the early 20th century, the battery was a summer residence for the consul-general of Austria- Hungary, Antonio Muscat Fenech. At this point, an extension was added to the battery, and it flew the Union jack and Austro-Hungarian ensign. Most of Dellia Battery was demolished in 1924 to make way for a new road, but the three escutcheons with coats of arms and a commemorative marble plaque which stood on the doorway were retained. The parapet was also retained, but it was eventually demolished after World War II when a roundabout was built in its place. Plinth with the battery's coats of arms and inscription Today, the only remains of the battery are the coats of arms and plaque which formerly stood on the doorway. These are mounted on a plinth on the side of the road. In addition, the foundations possibly still exist, buried under the modern road. The plinth containing the coats of arms and inscription is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. ==Further reading== * ==References== Notes ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Batteries in Malta Category:St. Paul's Bay Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1924 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ","title":"Dellia Battery"},{"id":"46391868","text":"is a Japanese slice of life comedy shōnen web manga series written and illustrated by Nozomi Uda.

The square was officially renamed Nelson Mandela Square on March 31, 2004. Sandton City, the largest retail complex in Africa, lies behind the statue. The location of the statue has been criticized due to Sandton Square's perception as a \\"symbol of commercial and social elitism\\". ==History== The statue was commissioned in July 2002 and completed in February 2004. It was unveiled in the square on March 31, 2004. It was sculpted by Kobus Hattingh and Jacob Maponyane. The statue was erected in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of South Africa's first democratic elections. It was the first-ever public statue of Mandela and was unveiled by his eldest granddaughter, Ndileka Mandela, who said of the statue that \\"While we honour Nelson Mandela in this statue, we are also honouring South Africa. He's not just a grandfather to us, but to the whole nation\\". A box for donations for the Nelson Mandela Foundation was placed beside the statue. ==Description== The statue stands high and measures from elbow to elbow. The statue weighs 2.5 tons. It has been described as \\"towering\\", \\"imposing\\", and a \\"focal point\\" for the entire area. The statue depicts Mandela wearing his Madiba shirt and dancing in what was referred to at the unveiling as the \\"Madiba jive\\".

It was based on a short film by Macneill and Chapman, Henley, which was in turn loosely inspired by a novel written by Chapman, Miss Corpus. Breeze plays the titular boy, a budding serial killer. == Synopsis == In 1989, John Henley owns a rural hotel in Colorado. After his wife abandons him, John retreats from his responsibilities into alcoholism. William Colby, a drifter, has a car accident near the hotel and befriends John's nine-year-old son, Ted. Unknown to John, Ted has become morbidly fascinated with death and has been acting out violently. With William's appearance, Ted begins to experiment with his urges to kill. == Cast == * Jared Breeze as Ted Henley * David Morse as John Henley * Rainn Wilson as William Colby * Bill Sage as the Sheriff * Mike Vogel * Zuleikha Robinson * Aiden Lovekamp as Ben * David Valencia as Marcus ==Themes== Film co-writer and director Craig William Macneill said that the themes of the film include \\"the dangerous blend of isolation, neglect and youth\\", and that audiences should take from his film a greater interest in the welfare of neighboring children. == Production == The story has its genesis in a book written by Clay McLeod Chapman, Miss Corpus. Chapman said that few people had read it except for Macneill. Fond of one chapter in particular, Macneill suggested they expand it to a short film, which eventually screened at the Sundance Film Festival. SpectreVision took an interest in the short, and it was expanded to feature length. A full trilogy is planned in which the lead character's progress will be examined at the ages of 9, 13, and 18. The trilogy is not based on the book and is original material. Macneill expects the films to be released in quick succession. Filming began on February 17, 2014, in Medellin, Colombia. Colombia was chosen due to its tax incentives and the fact that they could afford to build their own set – something not possible in the United States for their budget. It took six weeks to construct. Composer Hauschka was announced to have joined in April 2014. == Release == The Boy premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 2015. It received a limited release by Chiller Films on August 14, 2015. == Reception == Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 61% of 18 surveyed critics gave it a positive review with an average rating of 5.6/10, while Metacritic rated it 45/100 based on reviews from eight critics. Both Eric Kohn of Indiewire and Charlie Schmidlin of The Playlist found the film to be effective but dramatically lacking. Kohn wrote that the film \\"maintains a gripping sense of atmospheric dread\\", although its \\"consistently grave tone sometimes threatens to suffocate the dramatic momentum\\", while Schmidlin felt that the film has \\"extremely effective\\" parts, but it plays into negative stereotypes of \\"slow burn\\" psychological dramas. These sentiments were echoed by Ain't It Cool News who praised its \\"dark, broody tone\\", and by Dennis Harvey of Variety who wrote that the film seemed \\"endless and dull\\". Of the film's director, Craig Macneill, Carson Lund of Slant Magazine wrote, \\"Even if his talents tip the scales toward overstatement, Macneill has a command for composition and rhythm that belies his skinny résumé, and one can't help but be unnerved by Breeze's relentlessly deer-in-the-headlights performance as the sociopathic Ted.\\" Samuel Zimmerman of Shock Till You Drop commended Macneill's restraint and noted that his \\"disinterest in making a traditional slasher, let alone an iconic one, ultimately ends up with one of the most memorable contemporary iterations.\\" Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle also found it \\"more measured than the usual demon-child fare\\". Dominick Suzanne- Mayer of Consequence of Sound was impressed by the acting and wrote, \\"If the film itself slips a little too easily into the banality it’s chronicling at times, The Boy is sustained by the measured performances of the handful of wayward souls in its sparse, bleak world.\\" Drew Tinnin of Dread Central and Anton Bitel of Sight and Sound both believed that the film rewarded patient viewing. Tinnin wrote that \\"The slow start (and maybe a little of the middle) does pay off, however, with a conclusion that's shocking even after seeing what Ted’s already been up to\\", while Bitel found it to be \\"a slow-burner that builds and builds to its climactic conflagration\\". Bitel also compared it to Richard Linklater's Boyhood and considered The Boy to be a \\"disturbing flipside\\" to Linklater's film that succeeds in creating an \\"austere and chilling portrait of America's abandoned margins\\".http://www.bfi.org.uk/news- opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/london-2015/cult-round-up Andy Webster of the New York Times was impressed overall; he felt that the film worked despite its dramatic shortcomings, and called it \\"a feature stunning to behold\\" despite finding it \\"somewhat unpersuasive in narrative\\". However, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter took an opposing view and wrote, \\"While it's admirable that director Macneill and his co-scripter Clay McLeod Chapman opted to emphasize mood and psychology over the story's more exploitable elements, it nonetheless results in a listless tedium that isn't helped by the overly long running time.\\" Ken W. Hanley of Fangoria listed The Boy as one of his top ten horror films of 2015 and it also received two Fangoria Chainsaw Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actor and Best Score categories.http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-year-in-horror-2015-kens- top-10-horror-filmshttp://www.fangoria.com/new/never-mind-oscar-heres- the-2016-fangoria-chainsaw-awards-nominees-ballot/ Zack Sharf and Emily Buder of Indiewire selected the film as one of their \\"13 Most Criminally Overlooked Indies and Foreign Films of 2015\\",https://indiewire.com/article/the-13-most- criminally-overlooked-indies-and-foreign-films-of-2015-20151219 while HitFix included it in their list of \\"14 Great Under the Radar Films from 2015\\".http://www.hitfix.com/news/14-great-under-the-radar-films-from-2015 == References  External links == * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American serial killer films Category:American slasher films Category:Films set in 1989 Category:Films set in Colorado Category:Films shot in Colombia Category:Features based on short films Category:Films directed by Craig William Macneill Category:2015 directorial debut films ","title":"The Boy (2015 film)"},{"id":"46392008","text":"M.

In the 1920s, Stern's father sold his share of the business to retire to the farm in Fox Chase; Stern described this as his father's attempts to be a bit of a gentleman farmer, as well as author, playwright, and painter. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Stern's father became an independent real estate agent. Stern's mother was active in organizing Jewish summer camps for Philadelphia-area children. She was involved in supporting the National Farm School (now the Delaware Valley College of Science and Agriculture), which was founded by her uncle Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf in 1896, and where her ashes are now interred. She was also active with the local Juvenile Aid Society. The foster children would often spend Sundays at the family's farm in Fox Chase. Stern said that when they moved from the tight-knit German Jewish community in Philadelphia to Fox Chase, where they were the first Jews in the neighborhood, he and his brother would get chased home and called anti-semitic names.  Education  For parts of his childhood, Stern's parents took the family to Europe, where they traveled extensively. He learned German from a German governess in Hamburg. Stern spent seven months in school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1935, Stern received a BA from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1937, Stern received a Bachelor of Hebrew Letters from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. He earned a Master of Hebrew Letters in 1941 and the Doctor of Hebrew Letters in American Jewish History in 1957, all from Hebrew Union College. In 1966, Stern received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Hebrew Union College. == Career ==  Rabbinic career   Philadelphia  As did many of his family members, Stern attended Hebrew Union College, where he studied to be a rabbi. From 1941 to 1943, Stern was assistant rabbi to Rabbi Fineshriber at the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel, in Philadelphia, where his great-uncle, Joseph Krauskopf had previously served as rabbi. After the war, from 1946 to 1947, Stern returned to work as a rabbi at Keneseth Israel. In 1942, Stern was one of 90 Reform rabbis to sign a statement in support of aid to Palestine. The published statement said that the signatories were \\"opposing growing secularism and favoring greater emphasis on transcendent moral and religious values and principles in American life.\\" In 1943, Stern took a sabbatical from his position at Keneseth Israel to serve a Chaplain in the US Army Air Corps. During this time, during World War II, Stern almost died when his plane crashed at Casablanca during a flight to India; in a letter home to his father that was published in the local press, Stern said he felt lucky to have only broken an arm and a leg.  Norfolk, Virginia From 1947 to 1964, Stern was Rabbi of Ohef Sholom Temple in Norfolk, Virginia. During his time there, he completed his Doctor of Hebrew Letters in 1957 in American Jewish History under the tutelage of Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus. Stern was an amateur musicologist, writing program notes for the Norfolk Symphony Orchestra. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Synagogue Music of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. In 1960, Stern served as editor in chief of the Union Songster for Reform Judaism and coordinated the revision of the Union Hymnal, both of which are considered by Reform Jews to be the commonly used hymnals for religious services. He co-edited Songs and Hymns for Gates of Prayer, the New Union Prayer Book (GOP) that is a Reform Jewish siddur. He chaired the committee that created Shaarei Shira/Gates of Song.  New York City  From 1964 to 1980, Stern was the Central Conference of American Rabbis' first Director of Rabbinic Placement for Reform Judaism, assigning rabbis to congregations. After leaving CCAR in 1980, Stern joined Hebrew Union College's faculty as Adjunct Professor, where he lectured in Jewish History. He was also a field-work counselor for rabbinic students. Stern held both positions until his death. Hebrew Union President, Dr. Alfred Gottschalk, said Stern's \\"scholarship, his pioneering seminal research in American Jewish genealogy and writings remain a rich legacy and memorial.\\"  Genealogy career  Stern's interest in genealogy, he said, \\"started in grade school when he traced the descendants of Charlemagne for an assignment.\\" From 1949 to 1994, Stern was the genealogist for the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati. In 1960, Stern published Americans of Jewish Descent, in which he created extensive, fully sourced, family tree diagrams of all Jewish families who lived in American pre-1840. The work contained 26,000 names. Two more editions of the book followed: 1978's First American Jewish Families: 600 Genealogies, 1654–1977 and 1991's First American Jewish Families: 600 Genealogies, 1654–1988, which had over 50,000 surnames. The book was groundbreaking because of the volume of names and the thoroughness of the research. Many pre-1840, non-Jewish families discovered they had Jewish roots. It was considered one of the most valuable research tools in American Jewish genealogy and history. The work in these books was a source for much of Stephen Birmingham's 1981 book, The Grandees: America's Sephardic Elite. Stern was responsible for helping to establish the early Jewish genealogical societies in the United States. He was on the committee that hosted the first of what would become the annual International Conference on Jewish Genealogy now sponsored by the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS). He was instrumental in founding IAJGS. During his time as President of the Federation of Genealogical Societies, Stern worked to create the Genealogical Coordinating Committee. In a meeting in Salt Lake City in 1980, Stern brought together leaders from various genealogical entities—FGS, American Society of Genealogists, Association of Genealogical Educators, Association of Professional Genealogists, Board for Certification of Genealogists, International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS) and the National Genealogical Society—with a goal to foster better relationships between various genealogical groups that had common interests, especially supporting the work of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) so it would be available to genealogists. This meeting led to the formation of the Genealogical Coordinating Committee two years later, with a resulting National Archives Gift Fund (now known as the Malcolm H. Stern NARA Gift Fund) established. The purpose of the fund was to support NARA and other genealogical interests. Member organizations donated $1 per genealogist per year.  Activism  * While in Norfolk, Virginia, Stern was a civil right advocate, working against segregation and racism in the community Rabbi Kerry M. Olitzky said that Stern \\"fought for the civil rights of African Americans at a time and a place where such a stand was both unpopular and dangerous.\\" ** In 1951, Stern spoke at the Hunton Branch YMCA's \\"Y's\\" Men's Club urging members to donate blood, he said, \\"in order to show belief in the equality of races, since no distinction on account of color is made between blood donated at the center.\\" * NARA Independence (1981-1984) ** In 1981, when President Ronald Reagan's budget threatened the National Archives, Stern spearheaded efforts of genealogy and historical communities to support Archives Independence Bill S1421, in order to make NARA independent. On June 21, 1984, the United States Senate voted unanimously to S. 905, a bill that would separate NARA from the General Services Administration. On August 2, 1984, the House of Representatives passed similar legislation. * In 1989, Stern testified before the United States Congress, where he stated that the Archivist of the United States should not be an administrator, but rather a scholar. * In 1990, Stern worked with the National Archives and Records Administration to prepare four American genealogists for a genealogical mission to Russia, where they had been invited to help educate former Soviet archivists on how to respond to American requests for information about Russian ancestry. As part of these efforts, Stern helped to found the Russian- American Genealogical Archival Service (RAGAS).

In 2003 he was awarded the Gold Badge, the English Folk Dance and Song Society's highest honour. He had much experience of performing to an audience, setting him apart from better known folk song scholars and anthologists who collected material but were less concerned with singing it. == Life == Born in 1932, Roy Palmer was educated at the Grammar School, Coalville, and at Manchester University. While at college he met Harry Boardman, a folk singer whose left-wing views he shared throughout his life. He taught for many years in grammar and comprehensive schools around the Midlands and was headmaster of the Dame Elizabeth Cadbury School in Birmingham for eleven years. In the 1960s he began recording and publishing traditional folk songs. A collection of his recordings are in the British Library and other materials are archived at the Library of Birmingham. He met the BBC producer Charles Parker whilst organising informal folk song evenings for CND in Birmingham during the 1960s. The two men joined with other local enthusiasts to establish the Birmingham and Midland Folk Centre in order to sing folk songs, appraise each other's singing, collect and research songs and produce documentary dramas. He took early retirement, making time to explore his deep passion in all aspects of folk culture - its lore, dialect, crafts, arts, plays and above all, its songs and music. From 1970 to 2007 he produced a steady stream of books, articles and reviews, exploring social history through the medium of folk song and street ballads. In 2003 was awarded a gold badge, the highest honour bestowed by the English Folk Dance and Song Society, and in 2004 he received an honorary MA from the Open University. He was a long-standing member of The Folklore Society, chairman of the 'Friends of the Dymock Poets' for seven years and on the editorial board of Folk Music Journal for 20 years. == Bibliography == * Room For Company, Cambridge University Press, 1971: * Love is Pleasing, Cambridge University Press, 1974: * Songs of the Midlands, EP Publishing, 1972: * Rigs of the Fair (Roy Palmer and Jon Raven), Cambridge University Press, 1976; * Folk Music in School (Robert Leach and Roy Palmer), Cambridge University Press, 1978; * Feasts and Seasons - Spring (Anthony Adams, Robert Leach, Roy Palmer), Blackie, 1978; * Feasts and Seasons - Summer (Anthony Adams, Robert Leach, Roy Palmer), Blackie, 1978; * Feasts and Seasons - Autumn (Anthony Adams, Robert Leach, Roy Palmer), Blackie, 1977; * Feasts and Seasons - Winter (Anthony Adams, Robert Leach, Roy Palmer), Blackie, 1977: * Rose Shamrock Thistle Leek (Bryan Lester and Roy Palmer), Ricordi, 1989 * The Folklore Of Shropshire, Logaston Press, 2004; * Britain's Living Folklore, David & Charles, 1991; * Folklore Of Gloucestershire, Westcountry Books, 1994; * Folklore or Leicestershire and Rutland, Tempus Publishing, 2002: * Folklore of (old) Monmouthshire, Logaston Press, 1998: * Folklore of Hereford and Worcester, Logaston Press, 1992: * Folklore of the Black Country, Logaston Press, 2007; * Folklore of Radnorshire, Logaston Press, 2001: * Folklore of Shropshire, Logaston Press, 2004: * Folklore of Warwickshire, Tempus, 2004 (First published Batsford 1976); * Folklore of Worcestershire, Logaston Press, 2005; * Herefordshire Folklore, Logaston Press, 2002: * The Sound Of History, Oxford University Press, 1988; * A Ballad History Of England, Batsford, 1979; * Strike The Bell: transport by road, canal, rail and sea in the nineteenth century through songs, ballads and contemporary accounts, Cambridge University Press, 1978; * The Valiant Sailor, Cambridge University Press, 1973: * The Oxford Book of Sea Songs, Oxford University Press, 1986: * Boxing the Compass Sea Songs and Shanties, Heron Publishing, 2001: * A Touch On The Times, Penguin, 1974; * Poverty Knock, Cambridge University Press, 1974; * The Painful Plough, Cambridge University Press, 1972; * The Rambling Soldier, Penguin Books, 1977: * Everyman's Book of British Ballads, JM Dent and Sons, 1980: * Everyman's Book of English Country Songs, JM Dent and Sons, 1979: * Folk Songs collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams, JM Dent and Sons, 1983; * Secret River (Roy and Pat Palmer), Green Branch Press, 1998; * Let us be Merry (Gwilym Davies and Roy Palmer), Green Branch, 1996: * A Taste of Ale, Green Branch, 2000: * What A Lovely War - British Soldiers Songs, Michael Joseph London, 1990; * Ripest Apples, The Big Apple Association, 1996: * Working Songs, Herron Publishing, 2010: ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2015 deaths Category:English folklorists Category:English folk singers Category:English male non-fiction writers Category:20th-century British male writers Category:21st-century British male writers Category:People from Leicestershire ","title":"Roy Palmer (folklorist)"},{"id":"46392173","text":"The 2015 Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix was the third round of the 2015 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. It was held at the Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo in Santiago del Estero on 19 April 2015. In the MotoGP class, Marc Márquez took his second pole position of the season. In the race, he started well and pulled away from the field to a maximum advantage of 4 seconds. However, Valentino Rossi closed in on Márquez, and on lap 22, immediately followed him. At Turn 5, Márquez made contact with Rossi, with Márquez's bike hitting Rossi's rear tyre. Márquez could not rejoin, and as a result, Rossi took his second win of the season. Andrea Dovizioso took his third successive second place, while Cal Crutchlow took Team LCR's first podium since the 2013 United States Grand Prix with third place, after passing Andrea Iannone at the final corner. Crutchlow's teammate Jack Miller took his first win in the Open category with a twelfth-place finish, and aside from Márquez's retirement, Hiroshi Aoyama and Yonny Hernández were the only other riders not to make the finish. ==Classification== MotoGP Valentino Rossi, pictured at the 2015 Grand Prix of the Americas, was the winner of the MotoGP race. {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" !

It was located in the Skokloster parish in Uppland. It was the predecessor of the baroque Skokloster Castle. Skokloster Castle Skoklosters Church ==History== Sko monastery was founded around 1230 by Knut Långe. Byarums monastery was relocated to Sko in 1236. Sko Abbey was founded because an already existing convent, Byarum Abbey, which was founded in about 1170, was moved from Vaggeryd Municipality to Sko in the 1230s. Sko Abbey seem to have functioned as a school for daughters of the nobility, and the nuns often came from noble families. In 1520, the sister of Gustav I of Sweden, Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa, was given refuge there during the Stockholm Bloodbath. Dissolution During the Swedish Reformation in 1527, the Abbey was banned from accepting novices and its assets was confiscated by the crown in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden. The members were free to leave or to remain supported by an allowance from the estates formerly belonging to the Abbey. In 1566, these rights were confirmed, at which point the nuns were apparently still managing their school for daughters of the nobility. In 1577, only two nuns remained, and the last allowance to a nun of the Sko Abbey is recorded from 1588. After the Reformation, the monastery seems to have functioned as a girls' school and as a retirement home for older women. Post dissolution The building of the abbey itself was torn down in 1574. In the early 1600s, King Charles IX donated the property to the then 27-year-old Herman Wrangel as a reward for services rendered. His son Carl Gustaf Wrangel had Skokloster Castle built on the site in 1654–1676. Skokloster Church (Skoklosters kyrka) is used as the church of Skokloster Castle. ==Abbesses== The abbesses are only partially known. * R(ichissa) (1254) * Elin (1277) * Ramborg (1296) * Helga (1321) * Katarina (1326) * Vendilgerd (1352) * Leva (1398) * Alzeka Hennikadotter (1407) * Elisabet (1412) * Kristina Jonsdotter (1413) * Ragnhild (1423) * Katarina Jönsdotter (1410-1452) * Elin Filipsdotter (1457) * Brigitta Olofsdotter (1464) * Barbara Ludvigsdotter (1489) * Elin Petri (1503) * Katarina Jönsdotter (1509) * Ingeborg (1513) * Katarina Jönsdotter (1516) * Katarina Olofsdotter (1521) * Ingegärd Hansadotter (1534) * Benedicta (Bengta) Eriksdotter (1553) ==References== * Signum svenska kulturhistoria, Renässansen * Fornvännen: Frith Hall: Skokloster (1909). * Gustaf Elgenstierna, Den introducerade svenska adelns ättartavlor. 1925-36 ==Further reading== *Bengt Kylsberg; Ralf Turander (1997) Skokloster : reflections of a great era (Stockholm : Byggförlaget Kultur) ==External links== * Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor * Skandinaviens Kyrko-Häfder från de äldsta till närvarande tider samlade och ...

It was located near Fjugesta in Närke. It had the right to appoint the vicar of the Edsberg parish, which was under the jurisdiction of the abbey. The ruins of the buildings are preserved, and the Amphitheatre of the abbey are presently used as a Sylvan theater. ==History== Riseberga Abbey was founded in the late 12th-century: it is confirmed from at least 1180. It was benefited by Birger Brosa and his second consort queen dowager Bridget Haraldsdotter, who made large donations to it: the latter joined the convent after having been widowed in 1202. The abbey eventually became a large landowner through donations. In 1212, it was granted all confiscated property of convicted criminals for crimes committed in the area. Riseberga was placed under the administration of Julia and Alvastra monastery. Most of the members were females, but it had a minority of male members to assist the nuns: the males, however, lived outside of the walls of the convent. Riseberga was located isolated in the wilderness, and both nuns and monks of the community are known to have occasionally lived as hermits in the area around the convent. The abbey had the right to appoint the vicars of the Edsberg parish. In the 1340s, Saint Bridget of Sweden placed her daughter Ingeborg as a novice in the abbey: another one of her daughters, Catherine of Vadstena, was educated here. Dissolution By the Swedish Reformation of 1527 and in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, Catholic convents were confiscated by the crown and banned from accepting new novices, while the existing members were allowed to leave the convent or remain supported by a royal allowance. In 1534, the remaining members of the abbey left after having applied to be received by a convent abroad.

He also was a member of the Supreme Federal Court and the Superior Electoral Court of Brazil. Brossard was born in 1924 at Bagé, Rio Grande do Sul. He studied Law at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and specialized itself on constitutional and civil law areas, starting his career as a teacher at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, before his début as a politician. Later than, he was elected as a lawmaker for the State Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul, from there to the National Congress of Brazil, first as a representative and as a senator at last. He ran for the Vice Presidency of Brazil in the 1978 indirect elections for the MDB ticket (General Euler Bentes as President), during the Brazilian military government. He was defeated by Aureliano Chaves, while João Figueiredo was elected as President of Brazil. He played an important role on the crisis that arose when President elect Tancredo Neves could not be able to take office in 1985, as the first civilian citizen to bear such position after the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état. Confusion and discrepancies were spreading many different understandings on the Brazilian laws as Neves was unable to take office, at the same time his running mate for vice presidency, José Sarney, was empowered as acting president. He strongly supported Sarney's ability and rightness to exercise the presidential powers, stating \\"this is the reason why vice presidents exist\\". (In the aftermath, Tancredo Neves has died, never taking the oath, and Sarney completed his tenure).

Each of the heroes were respectively equipped with their own legendary equipment when summoned. Naofumi happened to receive the Legendary Shield, the sole defensive equipment, while the other heroes received a sword, a spear, and a bow, weapons meant for attack. Unlike the other heroes who are fully supported by the kingdom and gain several strong allies each, Naofumi's luck turns to the worse after his single companion, revealed to be the kingdom's Princess, betrays him, steals all his belongings, and leaves him devoid of all assistance and supplies after she falsely accuses him of sexually assaulting her. Mocked by the nobility and shunned by everyone from his fellow Heroes to peasants, a now cynical Naofumi is forced to train as a hero alone while working to make ends meet, until he buys from a slave trader a young tanuki demi-human girl named Raphtalia and an egg that hatches into a bird-like monster whom he names \\"Filo\\", both quickly growing into adulthood and becoming powerful warriors under his care. As they little by little gain the trust and gratitude of the people with their heroic actions, Naofumi and his companions work together to carry out their mission as saviors as they unravel the mystery of the Waves and the reason why they are a threat not only to their world, but to other worlds as well. ==Media== Light novel Originally published as a web novel, the series has been re-written with an expanded story-line.

Kadokawa producer Junichiro Tamura announced the wait for the third season will not be as long as the wait between the first two seasons. ==Reception== The light novel series had over 3.3 million volumes in print by December 2018, and the manga series had 1 million tankobon volumes in print by January 2019. As of April 2019, the light novels and manga have sold a combined 6.2 million copies in Japan, after their sales increased by 1.2 million copies in two months, mainly due to the success of the anime series. When the anime series began airing in the United States, the first episode came under controversy, with several reviewers criticising the show for its depiction of slavery, raising the question of slavery apologism, and the framing of a false rape accusation with many claiming that this was in poor taste following the Me Too movement. When the show's producer Junichiro Tamura was asked about the controversy, he responded that there \\"have not been any controversies regarding the series in Japan, so it is difficult to say. In the case there were any controversy domestically, we will try to address all issues with the staff and people involved to bring our customers a better product the next time.\\" Reviews of subsequent episodes have been positive. The reviewer Theron Martin gave a rating of B− for the first two episodes, stating \\"the series looks like it's gotten over its initial problematic hump and should hopefully slide into a more agreeable story flow.\\" He gave a B+ rating for the third episode, stating that \\"the series seems like it's angling to build Naofumi up more as a folk hero than the famously brazen heroes we're used to seeing in fantasy stories\\" and that \\"episode 3 gives the best argument to date for the series' possible potential.\\" Reviewer Timothy Donohoo heavily criticized the anime for having an \\"overpowered protagonist who's seemingly never wrong\\" and for the \\"socially contentious undertones\\", noting that \\"the series has gotten its fair share of well deserved flak\\". He further described the show \\"as just another generic isekai show, and a poorly done one at that\\", even without what he describes as \\"unsavory elements\\". He speculates that some viewers may sympathize with the protagonist, noting that this would \\"justify the show's label as an 'incel fantasy'\\". The character Raphtalia was selected as Best Girl for the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in 2020. ==References* * * Category:Book series introduced in 2012 Category:2013 Japanese novels Category:2019 anime television series Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Dark fantasy anime and manga Category:Fiction with false allegations of sex crimes Category:Funimation Category:Isekai anime and manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Kinema Citrus Category:Light novels Category:Light novels first published online Category:Media Factory manga Category:Parallel universes in fiction Category:Seinen manga Category:Shōsetsuka ni Narō Category:Upcoming anime television series ","title":"The Rising of the Shield Hero"},{"id":"46392379","text":"Edwin B. \\"Ted\\" Minden is a Canadian judge on the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

It was released on October 27, 2009, through Ruthless Records. This was Hopsin's only record released with Ruthless Records as the album created bitter tension between Ruthless and Hopsin, due to the lack of promotion and financial compensation for the album. Gazing at the Moonlight was supported by two singles: \\"Pans in the Kitchen\\" and \\"I'm Here\\". The title refers to \\"Gazing at the Moonlight\\" hoping and wishing on a dream to come true. The album stylistically incorporates elements of horrorcore, pop rap and comedy hip hop. In various interviews Hopsin discourages fans against buying the CD, due to its release on Ruthless, however, although the iTunes edition is widely available, the CD cannot be commonly found in music stores and is considered rare as the physical CD edition costs between $20–30. ==Background and recording== In 2007, Hopsin signed a deal with Ruthless Records, and was hailed as one of driving forces behind the attempt to bring Ruthless Records back to previous glory. The album was set to be self-produced by Hopsin and feature no collaborations with other artists, however, the final edition featured vocals from DJ K on the hook of the song \\"Motherfucker\\". However, the album was not released until October 27, 2009, with little to no promotion. After the album's release, Hopsin sought his release from Ruthless due to lack of financial compensation, artist support, and promotion. Due to the departure from Ruthless Records, Hopsin founded his own independent label, called Funk Volume, with Damien Ritter. SwizZz, Damien Ritter's younger brother and former classmate of Hopsin at Monroe High, was the first artist to be signed to Funk Volume. After launching Funk Volume, both Hopsin and SwizZz released a collaborative mixtape, titled Haywire in June 2009, to promote the label. Funk Volume wanted to sell it for retail sale, but were unable to, due to Hopsin still being contracted by Ruthless Records at the time. In an interview, Hopsin stated that many of the songs such as \\"Pans in the Kitchen\\" were performed and written when he was in the twelfth grade and he initially anticipated the album would be released in 2007 due to the album being completed long before the release, however Hopsin was unaware of Ruthless Records plans. ==Promotion== The album's first promotional single, \\"Sexy Cyber\\" was released and produced in 2007 with a music video, however, the video was not released due to issues with Ruthless Records until 2011. The album's lead single, \\"Pans in the Kitchen\\", was released on May 27, 2008, accompanied by a music video. The album's second single, \\"I'm Here\\", was released on March 17, 2009, in promotion of the album's release, a music video for the song was shot but remained unreleased until 2013 due to Hopsin's issues with Ruthless. A music video for, \\"Motherfucker\\", was released on April 10, 2010 and features vocals from DJ K and marked the final release of Hopsin before his departure from Ruthless Records in mid 2010. A music video for \\"Break It Down\\" was shot but remained unreleased until it was leaked onto YouTube. ==Commercial performance== The album was a commercial failure. According to Hopsin, the album sold 42 copies in its first week, with about 5 or 6 copies purchased by him and his mother. The album has sold over 100,000 copies in streaming since releasing the album on his own. ==Track listing== * All songs produced and written by Marcus Hopson ==References== Category:2009 debut albums Category:Hopsin albums Category:Ruthless Records albums ","title":"Gazing at the Moonlight"},{"id":"46392499","text":"St. John's Priory, Kalmar, commonly known simply as Kalmar Nunnery, was a Roman Catholic convent for women of the Dominican Order in Kalmar in Sweden, in operation from 1299 until 1505. ==History== The Abbey was founded by the rich landowner Margareta Gustafsdotter, who became its first abbess. The members of the Abbey predominately came from wealthy noble families who lived upon the income from their estates, and the life of the abbey was strictly reclusive, the nuns seldom coming in contact with the population of the city. According to the legend of the chronicle Rimkrönikan, a member of the abbey had a vision foretelling that Charles VIII of Sweden would one day wear a crown. The infamous lady Brita Tott was reportedly imprisoned here for a period of time after having been sentenced for treason.Brita Olovsdotter (Thott) i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) In 1505, the ongoing conflict between the Swedes and Danes around the city of Kalmar created fears that the Abbey, being strategically placed, would one day be in fear of being used by the Danes in a fight over the town. The members therefore relocated to the Skänninge Abbey, transferring the assets and privileges of the St. John's Priory with them. The buildings was used by the military, and eventually torn down in 1523-24. ==Legacy== An area of the city of Kalmar, Kvarnholmen, originally Systraholmen ('Islet of the Sisters') as well as a river, Systraströmmen ('River of the Sisters'), has been named after the abbey. ==References== * Kalmarlexikon.se * Aforum.genealogi.se * Skandia: Tidskrift för Vetenskap och Konst, Volym 3 Category:Dominican convents Category:1299 establishments in Europe Category:13th-century establishments in Sweden Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:1505 disestablishments in Sweden ","title":"St. John's Priory, Kalmar"},{"id":"46392512","text":"Misdeal (French: Maldone) is a 1928 French silent drama film directed by Jean Grémillon and starring Charles Dullin, Marcelle Dullin and Geymond Vital.Levine p.190 The film's sets were designed by art director André Barsacq.

She was born in Italy, and was first exposed to flamenco dance when she was 20. This prompted her to move to Spain to study the art, and has since worked on stage, television, film and other projects. She founded El Flamenco Vive in 1997, to promote the dance to children, especially Spanish children. The company has performed at major cultural festivals in Europe and other countries such as the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. Her work has been recognized with various awards including the Premio Cultural a la Didáctica from the XLVII Festival Internacional del Cante de las Minas and the Onoreflicenza di Cavaliere Dell’ Ordine della Stella della Solidarietá Italiana. ==Life and studies== Marin was born in 1967 in Milan, Italy. At the age of 20, she had her first contact with flamenco in her hometown, and fell in love with it. After finishing her degree in physical education at the Istituto Superiore di Educazione Fisica in Milan in 1991, she moved to Seville, Spain, although her parents were not enthusiastic about it. She began her flamenco studies at the Manolo Marín Academy in Seville, but soon after decided to move to the larger city of Madrid, and study at the Amor de Deios Centero for Flamenco Art under Maria Magdalena, La Tati, Manolete and Cristóbal Reyes among others. Her flamenco studies extended from 1990 to 2007, initially working in a children’s clothes store to pay for classes. In addition to flamenco classes she also has classes on the staging of opera pedagogically with American Mary Ruth McGinn at the Teatro Real de Madrid (2006), the teaching of singing to primary school children with Wolfgang Hartman, Mirari Pérez and Sofia López-Iboar in the Teatro Real de Madrid (2008), and clowning with Gabrial Chamé at the Laboratorio de Teatro William Layton.(2010-2011) She continues to work with Chamé at the Estudio Corazza and at the Chamé & Gené Estudios Teatrales giving classes in flamenco. ==Career== Through her dedication to flamenco, Marin has worked on tour, in film, television, as a dancer, choreographer, teacher and director. She has never sung on stage, but believes you must know how to do it as the singing is fundamental to flamenco. She has long been a singing student of Rafael Jiménez “Falo.” In her later career, she has turned mostly towards performing flamenco to children, using it as a teaching tool and working to promote it the upcoming generations. Her touring work includes performing the opera Carmen with the Antonio Vargas Flamenco Dance Theatre and the Companía de Tomás de Madrid group from 1992 to 2006, in countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Russia, the Ukraine and the Baltic states, as well as Spain. In 2002 she toured with the European Romani Symphony Orchestra of Schoumen in Spain and Bulgaria . For about ten years, from 1995 to 2005, she also worked with informal staging in Spain called tablaos such as those in El Café de Chinitas, Casa Patas and El Corral de la Morería. She stated that this helped her to learn as well, observing how the other artists moved, did their hair, wear makeup, clap their hands and interact with other artists. In 1997, she participated in several feature-length films: Alma Gitana by Chus Gutiérrez and Flamenco Women by Mike Figgis along with Sara Baras and Eva Yerbabuena, as well as a film with Jacques Weber in France. In 1995, she was the anchor of a program Flamenco con K for TeleK in Madrid and did the choreography for the television program Paco y Veva for TVE1 directed by José Pavón. She has taught flamenco classes in Spain, France and Italy from 1996 to 2009, in institutions such as the Tretino Danza Estate (Tesero, Verona and Milan), Taiwan, China and Algeria with the Instituto Cervantes and SEACEX. From 2008 to 2009 she worked with the Fundación Antonio Gades to create teaching guides for works such as Carmen, Bodas de sangre and Fuenteovejuna. This collaboration also produced the video series Flamenca en el Aula. Her awards include the Premio Cultural a la Didáctica from the XLVII Fesstival Internacional del Cante de las Minas (2007), the Onoreflicenza di Cavaliere Dell’ Ordine della Stella della Solidarietá Italiana from the president of the Republic of Italy (2008), the Premio Enrique Maya from the Comunidad de Madrid (2010) and the Premio Flamenco Hoy 2010 (2011) . ==El Flamenco Vive== In 1997, Marin founded the El Flamenco Vive Company, named after a flamenco shop opened in Madrid by enthusiasts. The company consists of four dancers, two men and two women, a percussionist, a guitarist and a singer, and is dedicated to promoting flamenco music and dance to children, especially Spanish children as part of their heritage. The shows are interdisciplinary and participatory demonstrating various styles of flamenco.

It was founded by Saint Ingrid of Skänninge, and the center of her cult, and as such, it was often referred to as St. Ingrid's Priory. Located near the church dedicated to Martin of Tours, it was originally named St. Martin's Priory, though this name was rarely used in practice. The common name for it was Skänninge Abbey, but as there was also a convent for male members of the Dominican Order in Skänninge, it was often called Skänninge Nunnery to separate it from the male monastery. ==History== The monastery was founded by Saint Ingrid of Skänninge, after her return from her pilgrimages in Europe. Having been widowed, she founded a convent and became its first abbess. Though founded in 1272, it was not formerly inaugurated before 12 August 1281, and it was given its privilege by Magnus III of Sweden in 1282. Coming from the elite of the Swedish nobility, Ingrid and her family was able to donate large estates to the establishment. The convent was built around a church dedicated to Saint Martin, which became its chapel, and was therefore formerly named St. Martin's Priory, though in reality, this name was not often used. On 2 September 1282, its abbess, Saint Ingrid, died, and her convent became the center of her cult and the target for pilgrimages, which made the name St. Ingrid's Priory much more common. The cult of Saint Ingrid benefited to convent and made it rich, and it was a successful rival to the male monastery of the same order in the city. In 1353, Magnus IV of Sweden donated Bjälbo to the convent. It was fashionable among wealthy people to be buried in the cemetery of the convent, and large donations were made to it in connections of the burial. Bridget of Sweden placed her daughter Cecilia Ulvsdotter in the convent in the 14th-century. In 1505, the very wealthy Dominican nunnery of St. John's Priory, Kalmar moved its members to the convent and transferred all its property and privileges to it. The city of Skänninge also benefited from the cult. In 1507, the Translation (relic) of Saint Ingrid was performed in the convent with great celebration in the city. Dissolution By the Swedish Reformation of 1527, Catholic convents were confiscated by the crown in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden and banned from accepting new novices, while the existing members were allowed to leave to convents or remain supported by a royal allowance. In 1531, the king demanded that the nuns move to Vadstena Abbey, but they refused. In 1544, however, the nuns from Skänninge, as the nuns from Askeby Abbey had been in 1529, were forcibly moved to Vreta Abbey. The remains of the abbey were excavated in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. ==Abbesses== The abbesses are only partially known. * Saint Ingrid of Skänninge (1281-1282) * Katarina (1323) * Alleidis (1348) * Iliana (1357-1377) * Humborgh (1380) * Ärmegard, Ermegard or Ermegerdh (1383-1397) * Ermegard (1412) * Margit Finvidsdotter (1430) * Ragnild Felagsdotter (1435) * Petronilla Petersdotter (1448) * Birgitta Petersdotter (1491) ==References== * Hanna Menander \\"S:ta Ingrid\\", i Tom Carlsson (red) ÖstgötaPlatser.

He has done this by having the courage play uncompromising music, unafraid to bring us tears and flowers wrapped up in the blues. Not intimidated by jazz history, Matthew has spent his life learning how feel comfortable stepping into the unknown part of the tone world. In this new CD Matthew appears with Mat Walerian, whose playing reminds me of the Japanese paintings of Sesshu, full of fine lines, images, and sounds that tell haiku-like stories, arresting and mysterious. As the music progresses from clarinets to alto sax to flute, you can hear sound and space disrobe to reveal villages with beautiful clouds over trees laced with seraphic hues and birds dancing. The musicians are never concerned about style or genre. What do I call this music ? One word comes to mind : “Exquisite.” Throughout his musical career, Shipp has been able to accomplish a rare thing. That is to be able to find the center in the music every time he plays. This music is more concerned with poetics because it is poetics, not technique or academics, that will allow the music to go inside and change the soul of the listener. It is transcendence of music that will lead us to transcendence. I enjoyed this music on many levels; the more I listen to it, the more layers of brilliance I discover. So remember, give it repeated listening; accept it for what it is, not for what it is not. Mat Walerian plays some of most lovely and relaxed uncompromised beauty that I have ever heard in a long time. Now some might ask, who is this saxophone player ? Who has he studied with, where does he come from ? I say accept him, he loves music and has risen to his apex in this duet with Matthew Shipp. The most important thing is not who he studied with, the most important thing is that he is alive on the scene. Mat Walerian is one of the special ones, and along with Matthew Shipp they have created a new music called Elusive Beauty.

D. Roy, was a British economist who is known for the Roy model of self-selection and income distribution and Roy's safety-first criterion. ==Early life and education== Andrew Donald Roy was born 28 June 1920. His father, Donald Whatley Roy, was a physician. A. D. Roy began studies in mathematics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University in 1938. He won the distinguished Tripos award in 1939 in mathematics. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and he eventually served in the Fourteenth Army in India. He fought in the Battle of Imphal which stemmed the Japanese invasion of India in 1944. During his service, Roy contracted jaundice and suffered a nervous collapse, which lingered in the form of depression. After the war, he returned to Cambridge to study economics and history and was awarded a second Tripos award in economics in 1948. He later married Katherine Juliet Grove-White, and the pair had a son, Donald James Roy, and two daughters. He completed his Master of Arts in Economics at Cambridge in 1950, reading under Professor Edward Austin Gossage Robinson. Roy died on 12 March 2003 of heart disease. (See Sullivan, 2011 for a more complete biography and Heckman and Sattinger, 2015 for an intellectual biography.) ==Career== Roy was appointed Faculty Assistant Lecturer in Statistics at Cambridge University in 1949. In 1950, Roy was appointed Director of Economic Studies at Cambridge and then University Lecturer in Economics and Politics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1951. While at Cambridge, Roy wrote an influential paper on productivity and the shape of the distribution of earnings which he substantially generalized in his seminal 1951 article on self-selection and income inequality (Roy, 1951). In addition, Roy made a fundamental contribution to portfolio theory in his paper ‘Safety First and the Holding of Assets’ (1952). Roy left Sidney Sussex College in 1962 to serve as Economic Consultant and later Senior Economic Advisor to the Treasury. In 1964, Roy entered civil service, and worked for the Treasury, Department of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Defence, and Department of Health and Social Security. During this time, Roy addressed issues more closely related to macroeconomics such as labor productivity (Roy, 1982; Roy and Wenban-Smith, 1983). == Contributions == Roy (1951) recognized that a major mechanism guiding assignment in the labor market is David Ricardo's principle of comparative advantage. A worker choosing an occupation will compare the income from one occupation with the income from another occupation. To use the example provided by Roy in his 1951 paper, a person who chose trout fishing would have a comparative advantage at that activity compared to a person who chose rabbit catching. A second consequence of the choice of occupations is that the distribution of earnings is built up from the distributions of earnings in individual occupations. The distribution of earnings within an occupation is affected by the selection of workers into that occupation, as determined by ‘the association existing between any individual’s performance in the two occupations’ (Roy, 1951, p. 494). Roy considers both positive and negative correlation between performances. As a result of the selection, the aggregate distribution of earnings depends on the occupations available to workers and their performances in different occupations. Selection among alternative occupations, as described by Roy, draws on notions of potential outcomes used in the literature on the design of experiments (Neyman, 1923; Cox, 1958). Like later work by Quandt (1972), Gronau (1974) and Heckman (1974, 1976), he added a choice mechanism to the model of potential outcomes in the statistical literature determining allocations of individuals across sectors associated with outcomes.Heckman, 2008 discusses the contribution of economists to the Neyman–Fisher–Rubin literature on potential outcomes. Roy introduced economic decision-making into the determination of occupations and earnings and thereby anticipated procedures later used for the rigorous analysis of earnings data. Roy's selection phenomenon has been applied and extended to a wide range of other contexts, including: choice of market versus non-market work and wage comparisons (Gronau, 1974; Heckman, 1974, 1976; Lewis, 1974); and more general decision rules (see the survey in Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007a). His work also affected analysis of choice in: union versus non-union sectors (Lee, 1978); levels of education (Willis and Rosen, 1979); geographical region (Robinson and Tomes, 1982); marital status (McElroy and Horney, 1981); occupational choice (Miller, 1984); piece rate versus salary pay structures (Lazear, 1986); industry changers (Solon, 1988; Gibbons and Katz, 1992); immigration (Borjas, 1990); and segmented labor markets (Magnac, 1991). Flinn and Heckman (1982) extend Roy's selection model by incorporating choices based on search. See French and Taber (2011) for a comprehensive discussion of the use of the Roy model in labor economics. Analysis of selection bias has led to substantial improvements in the evaluation of social programs (Heckman et al., 1996, 1997; Abbring and Heckman, 2007; Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007a, b). A further extension considers general equilibrium models of income distribution and treatment effects (Heckman et al., 1998; Abbring and Heckman, 2007). The Roy (1951) model which analyzes potential outcomes using a choice mechanism improves on later, less clearly formulated work exposited in statistics under the rubric of the \\"Rubin model\\". See Heckman (2008) and Heckman and Sattinger (2015). Roy also made a fundamental contribution to finance. His (1952) paper is widely regarded as a contribution to portfolio theory co-equal with that of the Nobel-Prize winning analysis of Harry Markowitz (1952). Both developed the mean-variance trade-off for a portfolio of correlated assets (Markowitz, 1991). Reflecting on his 1952 work and Roy's (1952) paper, Markowitz wrote: ‘On the basis of Markowitz (1952), I am often called the father of modern portfolio theory (MPT), but Roy can claim an equal share of this honor’. (Markowitz, 1999, p. 6) For a more extensive discussion of Roy's contribution to portfolio theory, see Bernstein (1992) and Sullivan (2011). ==Publications== * The distribution of earnings and of individual output Economic Journal, vol. 60(239), pp. 489–505.

The film stars Blake Lively and Jason Clarke. It was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released by Open Road Films (the company's final film) in around 250 theaters in the United States on October 27, 2017. ==Plot== When a blind woman, Gina (Blake Lively), regains her sight after a corneal implant, she begins to discover the previously unseen and disturbing details about her life with her husband James (Jason Clarke). Before the eye surgery, Gina and James have a happy marriage, despite Gina's dependence on James due to her disability. James appears to enjoy the dependence, saying that it makes him feel special. As they try for a baby, Gina prepares for a cornea transplant, which will restore the sight in one of her eyes. The surgery is a success, and Gina embraces her newfound independence. Immediately, her sex life with James suffers. To put the spark back into their marriage, James books them a holiday to Barcelona, promising Gina that he has reserved the same hotel room they had on their honeymoon. Upon their arrival, Gina claims the room is not the same, which James denies. Gina is later proven to be correct. During the trip, Gina is shown to be growing in independence and confidence while James is left behind, seemingly unable to connect to the version of her that no longer depends on him. Resentful of her diverted attention, James begins to show signs of possessiveness. After Barcelona, they attempt to have sex on a sleeper train. James, blindfolded, demands to know who Gina fantasizes about when she masturbates, seemingly doubtful when she answers that she only thinks of him. Gina finally reveals that she does think of other men. James later rewatches a video of the encounter, obsessed with his helplessness and Gina's emotionless face. Still in Spain, Gina and James arrive at Gina's sister's house. One night, Gina visits a peep show with her sister and brother-in-law. James declines their invitation to join and appears uncomfortable when Gina's brother-in-law jokingly suggests that Gina may find someone better looking. While walking back to the house, Gina is groped by a stranger on the street, who her brother-in-law punches. Back at her sister and brother-in-law's house, James is mad at Gina for embarrassing him in front of her sister when she got mad at him for not sticking up for her. Back home in Thailand, Gina begins to have trouble with her vision: her eyes water unusually and her vision worsens. It is heavily implied that James is diluting her eye drops with water (thus damaging the transplant) to make her return to being dependent on him. Confused and terrified by her returning blindness, Gina brings her eye drops to her doctor, who promises to test them for contamination. James learns that he is sterile but does not tell Gina. While James purchases a new house at Gina's insistence, Gina begins to flirt with Daniel, an attractive man she had met at the public pool. When her dog overheats during a walk, Daniel offers to take them back to his home for water. There, he and Gina have sex. Gina later reveals to James that she is pregnant, unintentionally confirming her affair as she is unaware of James's infertility. James does not confront her. Similarly, when Gina learns from her doctor that her eye drops have been tampered with, she does not confront James. Their home is broken into and their dog is stolen. Some time later, a visibly pregnant Gina is apparently having trouble with her vision, now in need of her old cane and aid from James. She and James move into their new house. At one point, James tests Gina's blindness, intentionally hiding from her in her blind spot. He makes plans to meet her at a local school for a talent show in which she is performing. While he is gone, Gina receives an anonymous letter, written in crayon, which reveals that James was the one who staged the home invasion and released their dog. The writer claims to have rescued the dog but refuses to return it because \\"when I look into her eyes, she looks back at me, and that is what love is.\\" James goes to their old apartment to collect the last of his and Gina's belongings. In the bathroom, he uncovers a stash of empty eye drop bottles. He realizes that Gina discovered his deception and secretly continued to obtain eye drops from the doctor, meaning that she has been faking her returning blindness. Gina confirms this when she looks directly at him during the talent show. Distraught, James drives home in tears, and seems to purposefully crash into an oncoming truck. Some time later, Gina gives birth, and the final scene is Gina seeing her baby for the first time. ==Cast== *Blake Lively as Gina *Jason Clarke as James *Ahna O'Reilly as Carla *Yvonne Strahovski as Karen *Wes Chatham as Daniel *Danny Huston as Doctor Hughes ==Production== In February 2015, Blake Lively and Jason Clarke joined the cast of the film, with Marc Forster directing from the screenplay he co-wrote with Sean Conway.

Spa-Francorchamps hosted the second race of the 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship with 54,000 people attending the race weekend. The No. 17 Porsche of Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley, and Mark Webber qualified in pole position and maintained the lead until it was issued with a stop-and-go penalty, allowing Marc Lieb, Romain Dumas and Neel Jani to take over the lead. Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer took over the lead when Jani made a scheduled pit stop. Lotterer and Lieb battled for the position until the former made a pit stop that had Tréluyer assume his driving duties. He overtook Lieb to move to the front of the race where he remained for the rest of the event to win after Audi elected to keep him on track. Lieb, Dumas and Jani finished second and Bernhard, Hartley and Webber was third. Lotterer, Fässler and Tréluyer covered a record- breaking track distance of over 176 laps. The Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category was won by the No. 38 Jota Sport of Simon Dolan, Harry Tincknell and Mitch Evans. The car was penalised for jumping the start, but Evans took the class lead after passing co-pole sitter Julien Canal in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing entry and held it for most of the race to earn his first category win in the World Endurance Championship; while it was Dolan and Tincknell's second in the sport. The No. 99 Aston Martin Racing car of Fernando Rees, Richie Stanaway and Alex MacDowall took the victory in the Le Mans Grand Touring Professional (LMGTE Pro) class, their first in the World Endurance Championship. Porsche Team Manthley's cars finished second and third after Gianmaria Bruni was penalised for a pit stop infringement, and Darren Turner in the No. 97 Aston Martin entered the pit lane. The Le Mans Grand Touring Amateur (LMGTE Am) category was won by Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy and Mathias Lauda, ahead of AF Corse's No. 83 Ferrari of François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard and Rui Águas. The result meant Lotterer, Fässler and Tréluyer extended their Drivers' Championship advantage over Lieb, Dumas and Jani to be 14 points ahead of the three drivers. Alexander Wurz, Mike Conway and Stéphane Sarrazin moved from fourth to third with their Toyota teammates Anthony Davidson and Sébastien Buemi dropping to fourth position. Bernhard's, Hartley's and Webber's third-place finish meant they moved into fifth place. Audi moved further ahead of Porsche in the Manufacturers' Championship while Toyota dropped to third position with six races left in the season. ==Background== Entrants Nico Hülkenberg (pictured in 2016) made his first sports car racing appearance at Spa-Francorchamps. Thirty-four cars were officially entered for the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, with the bulk of the entries in Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2). The 2014 race winners, Toyota, returned to defend their title. Three manufacturers were represented in LMP1, including a trio of cars entered by Audi Sport Team Joest and Porsche, while Toyota elected to bring only two vehicles. René Rast, Marco Bonanomi and Filipe Albuquerque made their first appearances in the 2015 championship driving the 9 Audi, while Nico Hülkenberg, Earl Bamber and Nick Tandy in Porsche's No. 19 car all entered the LMP1 category for the first time in their careers. As in Silverstone, Rebellion Racing chose not to take part in the event, leaving Team ByKolles as the sole LMP1 privateer team. Christian Klien returned to compete for Team ByKolles having originally intended to race for the team only at Silverstone. LMP2 consisted of ten cars with 30 drivers. With Tandy driving for Porsche, KCMG employed Toyota's test and reserve driver Nicolas Lapierre to fill his position for the Spa-Francorchamps race and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. GP2 Series driver Mitch Evans made his first appearance in sports car racing alongside European Le Mans Series competitor Simon Dolan, and Nissan factory driver Harry Tincknell for Jota Sport. Despite a failed buyout of the team by Kairos, a data encryption company, Team SARD Morand confirmed their commitment to the World Endurance Championship and opted to bring one car which was driven by Oliver Webb, Pierre Ragues and Zoël Amberg. Johannes van Overbeek returned to co-drive for Extreme Speed Motorsports after missing the season's opening round because of a rib injury. The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) field consisted of three manufacturers (Aston Martin, Ferrari and Porsche), while the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) entrants were six teams: Aston Martin Racing, AF Corse, Larbre Compétition, Dempsey-Racing Proton, Porsche Team Manthley, and SMP Racing. The No. 91 Porsche 911 was vacated after regular driver Michael Christensen missed the Spa race because of a United SportsCar Championship commitment, while Richard Lietz moved to the team's No. 92 entry and the car was driven by Sven Müller and Kévin Estre. Nicki Thiim was unable to attend the event because he was taking part in the ADAC GT Masters Championship, so the No. 95 Aston Martin was driven as a two-driver operation by Marco Sørensen and Christoffer Nygaard. The team's No. 97 entry became a three-person driver team when McLaren factory driver Robert Bell made his first start of the year alongside Stefan Mücke and Darren Turner. Ferrari's factory team AF Corse entered a second car in LMGTE Am which was driven by Duncan Cameron, Alex Mortimer and Matt Griffin. Preview Circuit de Spa- Francorchamps, where the race was held. The 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps was confirmed as part of the FIA World Endurance Championship's 2015 schedule in an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Doha on 3 December 2014. It was the second of eight scheduled endurance sports car races of the 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship, and the fourth running of the event as part of the championship. It was held on 2 May 2015 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Stavelot, Belgium following two days of practice and qualifying. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps is a race track that is 7.004 kilometres (4.352 mi) long and has twenty corners. Endurance racing events were first held at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in 1924 with the Spa 24 Hours. Thirty-nine years later, the track began holding World Sportscar Championship races which later expanded to . It was cancelled after the 1975 running because of modern safety concerns. It was resurrected in 1982 on the reconfigured Spa-Francorchamps track layout and remained on the calendar until 1990. Spa-Francorchamps again began holding endurance sports car races from 1999, and the 6 Hour event was made part of the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2012. The race is considered by many as a final preparation event for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Before the race Audi Sport Team Joest drivers André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer led the Drivers' Championship with 25 points, seven ahead of their nearest rivals Marc Lieb, Romain Dumas and Neel Jani in second, and a further three in front of third-placed Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima. Their teammates Alexander Wurz, Mike Conway and Stéphane Sarrazin were fourth on 12 points, and Loïc Duval, Lucas di Grassi and Oliver Jarvis stood in fifth place on ten points. Audi led the Manufacturers' Championship with 35 points, seven ahead of rival Toyota in second; the third- placed manufacturer Porsche had scored 19 points. Audi had won the preceding 6 Hours of Silverstone with Lieb, Dumas and Jani finishing in second place, while Davidson, Buemi and Nakajima came in third position. Some teams made modifications to their cars in preparation for the event. Audi installed low- downforce setups on its No. 7 and 8 cars while their third entry used a version observed at the Silverstone race. The design was optimised to omit downforce, thereby reducing drag, for better preparation for competing on high-speed tracks. This was done by modifying the car's side pods and openings on the inside surface of its fenders. New cooling techniques were achieved by creating new suspension solutions to restrict spring displacement which also reduced underside turbulent airflow. Porsche chose to use high downforce configurations on all three of their 919 Hybrid cars as they did previously at Silverstone. The ByKolles CLM P1/01 was further developed and had a new front nose equipped after it completed a shakedown test on 24 April. ==Practice== Kazuki Nakajima (pictured in 2012) withdrew from the race after fracturing his vertebra in a free practice incident. Three practice sessions—two on Thursday and a third on Friday—were held before the Saturday race. The Thursday afternoon and evening sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Friday afternoon. The first session was held in heavy rain. Lieb's No. 18 Porsche was fastest with a time of 2:16.616, ahead of Davidson in the No. 1 Toyota in second. Brendon Hartley and Hülkenberg in Porsche's two other cars were third and fourth; Rast's No. 9 Audi rounded out the top five. LMP2 was led by Jonny Kane's No. 42 Strakka Racing Nissan with a lap of 2:32.672; he battled with Tincknell for the quickest class time. Estre's Porsche was the quickest in LMGTE Pro while Klaus Bachler helped the German company to be the fastest in LMGTE Am. The session was disrupted when Nakajima drove into the back-end of Jarvis's car heading into Les Combes corner. Nakajima was unable to see Jarvis because of heavy spray reducing visibility on the Kemmel straight. Nakajima complained of severe back pain and was transported to Verviers hospital where a check-up found he had fractured vertebra. He was deemed unfit to take part in the race. Toyota's test and reserve driver Kamui Kobayashi was in Japan and unavailable, so the No. 1 car ran as a two-driver operation for the remainder of the event weekend. It missed the second practice session because it required monocoque rebuilding. The No. 8 Audi also missed the second practice session because it was undergoing rear-end repairs. Heavy rain continued to affect the track in the second practice session. Conditions deteriorated as the session advanced, and several cars elected not to improve their quickest times to avoid driving off the track after going through standing water. Conditions allowed the fastest LMP2 and LMGTE vehicles to reach the top five quickest overall times. Bamber recorded the fastest time at 2:25.495, nearly half a second faster than Bernhard in the sister Porsche in second. Lotterer was third-fastest and had the fastest time early in the session. Evans achieved the only time under the 2:34.500 mark in LMP2 with a lap of 2:34.370. Lietz led LMGTE Pro with No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari of Rui Águas the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. The final practice was held on a dry race track which allowed for faster lap times. Lotterer set the quickest time of the weekend so far at 1:57.368 recorded in the session's final minute, and was 0.011 seconds faster than the second-fastest car of Hülkenberg. Jani was a further five-tenths of a second behind in third place, and was narrowly faster than teammate Hartley in fourth. Sam Bird was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing car with a time of 2:08.415, four-tenths ahead of Matthew Howson's KCMG Oreca. Toni Vilander recorded the quickest LMGTE Pro time ahead of Fernando Rees in the No. 97 Aston Martin, while Pedro Lamy, driving the British marque's No. 98 car, was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am. A brief full course yellow flag was displayed when Bachler's back-end collided with the Pouhon corner tyre barrier, while Turner avoided going into the Les Combes wall and was temporarily beached in the turn's gravel trap. Both drivers returned to the track and continued. ==Qualifying== Timo Bernhard (pictured in 2016) clinched the third consecutive pole position of his and his co-driver's careers. Friday's late afternoon qualification session was divided into two groups lasting 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each, with the starting order determined by the competitors' fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The session took place in clear, mild and dry weather. Hülkenberg's first timed lap of 1:55.130 surpassed the LMP1 pole position record time only to be surpassed by Hartley's 1:54.777 lap time to place the No. 17 Porsche in provisional pole position. Bernhard took over from Hartley and recorded a lap that was 0.027 seconds faster than the latter lowering the car's two-lap average time to 1:54.767 clinching pole position. It was the third consecutive event where Bernhard, Mark Webber and Hartley started from pole position. They were joined on the grid's front row by the sister No. 19 car after Tandy set a lap time at the session's conclusion that put him 0.257 seconds behind his teammates. Jani and Lieb qualified in third position, three-tenths of a second slower than the two sister Porsche cars. Lotterer twice went onto the track and improved his first lap time by 0.116 seconds to 1:55.114, while Fässler was unable to find a rhythm, and could not improve on his co-driver's fastest time, restricting them to qualifying fourth. Duval and di Grassi took fifth place with the latter stating that the team was not happy with the No. 8 car's setup, and that overnight work had to be undertaken. Davidson and Buemi held fifth place until di Grassi and Duval's lap times demoted them to sixth. Conway and Sarrazin secured seventh with the latter saying that he was held up by slower cars on his two timed laps. Albuquerque and Rast filled the grid's fourth row by qualifying eighth ahead of the No. 4 Team ByKolles car. In LMP2, Bird and Julien Canal took the fastest two-lap average time of 2:07.761; Canal pushed hard on new tyres during his second timed run having disliked his previous attempt. The pair were two-tenths of a second faster than the second-place qualifiers, Howson and Lapierre, and held the class pole position until Canal's lap. Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car took third in the category, while the second G-Drive Racing entry was fourth, with fifth-placed qualifier Tincknell recording the session's best class individual lap time. Richie Stanaway and Rees, competing in the No. 99 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average time of 2:16.840. Gianmaria Bruni was 0.070 seconds off the Aston Martin's pace, and started from second place in the category, displacing Turner and Mücke from the position. Turner's fastest lap was invalidated after he went off the track and was required to set another time. James Calado and Davide Rigon secured fourth in AF Corse's No. 71 Ferrari with Sørensen and Nygaard rounding out the top five. Aston Martin's No. 98 entry driven by Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took pole position in LMGTE Am, more than a second faster than the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Corvette of Paolo Ruberti and Gianluca Roda. Post-qualifying KCMG's No 47 car had its qualifying lap times disallowed after it was discovered in post-qualifying scrutineering that the vehicle's skid block had insufficient rigidity and had been excessively flexible. The penalty meant Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car was promoted to second in LMP2 and the No. 47 entry was required to start from the pit lane with a 30-second time penalty.

Weather conditions at the start of the race were dry and cloudy with an air temperature ranging from and a track temperature between ; a 50 percent chance of rain was forecast. 54,000 people attended the race weekend. The race began at 14:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00). Hartley maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Lieb passed Tandy to take over second position, while Fässler moved to third, after passing Tandy at the Bus Stop chicane at the first lap's conclusion. Tandy reclaimed third from Fässler shortly afterward. Team SARD Morand held the LMP2 lead before its car was overtaken by Tincknell and Bird on lap two. Duval moved in front of Wurz for fifth and the Toyota driver dropped to seventh. Jota Sport was issued with a drive-through penalty after its car was adjudged to have jumped the start and rejoined in sixth in LMP2, allowing Bird to the front of the category. Tandy drove to the inside of Estre to lap him, but made head-on contact with his car and went straight into the Pif Paf corner barrier. Both drivers continued, but Tandy drove into the pit lane for repairs, falling to the rear of the field. Fässler battled with Lieb for second as the two moved through slower traffic, but the Audi driver spun at the Bus Stop chicane allowing Lieb to take over second. Ryan Dalziel brought the No. 30 Extreme Speed Motorsports car into the team's garage to allow his mechanics to replace a broken boost line falling to the rear of the LMP2 field. Most of the field elected to make their first scheduled pit stops before the first hour had passed. Hartley went straight on at the Bus Stop chicane after locking his front brakes. He rejoined the track by driving onto the escape road and through a marshal's post. This prompted the stewards to call Hartley up to their office and he went up after he was relieved. Fässler crossed the white line at the pit lane entry, which led to Audi receiving a reprimand from the stewards. Tincknell moved back into second place in LMP2 and separated both G-Drive cars. Roald Goethe went backwards into the Eau Rouge corner exit barrier after taking over from Stuart Hall, requiring lengthy repairs to his car. Estre was issued with a drive-through penalty after he was adjudged to have caused the collision between himself and Tandy. Tandy stopped his Porsche briefly at the pit lane entry, while Bonanomi went wide driving up to Radallion corner battling Wurz for sixth. The incident involving Hartley handed the No. 17 Porsche a 15-second, stop-and-go penalty as he was deemed not to have respected track limits and causing danger to marshals. Bernhard took the penalty on the 17th lap, promoting teammate Jani to the lead. Evans moved to the front of the LMP2 field after overtaking Canal heading into the Bus Stop chicane. Fässler ceded third position to Duval at Les Combes corner. Bernhard was caught by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly pressured Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner. Dumas extended his advantage over Lotterer to 19 seconds, while Canal reclaimed the LMP2 lead when Evans made a scheduled pit stop. Lotterer made a pit stop for tyres and fuel. Dumas and Jarvis reacted shortly afterwards. Di Grassi took over from Jarvis, while Lotterer gained five seconds on Dumas. While switching drivers from Bernhard to Webber, Porsche changed a problematic damper on the No. 17 car. Approaching Blanchimont corner Kristian Poulsen went backwards into the barrier after colliding with a G-Drive Racing car that was lapping him. This prompted a localised yellow caution flag, and enabled Aleksey Basov and Khaled Al Qubaisi to inherit second and third places in LMGTE Am. Rigon was lapping Al Qubaisi at the Bus Stop chicane, but the Porsche driver drove defensively and both cars spun. Bruni reduced his speed to avoid colliding with the stationary cars. Webber passed Rast for sixth place, while Poulsen retired because of accident damage while attempting to return to the pit lane. Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an engine control unit and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the outside for fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car. Benoît Tréluyer (pictured in 2013) took the victory for the No. 7 Audi team. Tréluyer took over from Lotterer during a pit stop and Lieb regained the lead. Tréluyer caught Lieb and passed him around the outside at La Source corner, holding the lead until Lieb reclaimed it by employing his car's hybrid boost system to overtake him on the Kemmel straight. Tréluyer managed to take over the first position when he got ahead of Lieb around the outside of Pif Paf corner, despite the two making earlier contact at Pouhon corner. Lieb made a pit stop for new tyres and Jani climbed aboard the No. 18 car. Bruni passed Bell to move into second in LMGTE Pro. Smoke bellowed from the left exhaust of Bird's car, and he drove to his garage for diagnosis. Bruni reduced the time deficit to Alex MacDowall and passed him by using the Bus Stop chicane kerbs to claim the LMGTE Pro lead. Tréluyer was under eight seconds in front of Lieb as the final hour began. Lapierre moved ahead of Paul-Loup Chatin to take over fourth place in LMP2, while Jani reduced the time deficit to two seconds in arrears of Tréluyer on lap 154. He passed him with hybrid boost assistance on the Kemmel straight on the following lap. Audi elected to keep Tréluyer on track when Lieb made a pit stop for fuel. He remained there until lap 164 when he stopped for fuel but not tyres. Jarvis went straight into Stavelot corner's barriers in the event's closing two minutes. Tréluyer maintained the lead for the rest of the race winning after completing 176 laps at a track record- breaking distance of . Jani finished second, 13.424 seconds adrift of the No. 7 Audi, and Bernhard completed the podium positions by finishing third, albeit one lap behind. It was Audi's second consecutive overall series' victory of the season. Unchallenged in the closing stages, Jota Sport were victorious in LMP2, one lap ahead of the second-place G-Drive Racing car of Gustavo Yacamán, Ricardo González and Pipo Derani, and third-position finishers Webb, Ragues and Amberg of Team SARD Morand. It was Evans's first LMP2 victory in the World Endurance Championship, while it was Tincknell and Dolan's second in the series. Bruni was issued with a one-minute, stop-and-go penalty because his mechanics did not check one of his tyres at his final scheduled pit stop. Rees took over the class lead which he maintained to clinch victory in LMGTE Pro. Turner held third, but made a pit stop, allowing Lietz and Muller to finish in second and third places in the category. This was Rees's, Stanaway's and MacDowall's first class victories in the World Endurance Championship. Aston Martin finished as the winners in LMGTE Am, ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse of François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard, and Agias with SMP Racing's No. 72 entry of Viktor Shaitar. Aleksey Basov and Andrea Bertolini completed the class podium positions. Dalla Lana, Mathias Lauda's and Lamy's win was their second consecutive in LMGTE Am. Post-race The top three finishers of all four classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Tréluyer was delighted with the victory, saying: \\"What a race, It was a tough lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but it was huge fun and we’re already looking forward to Le Mans.\\" He further stated: \\"We did it and I am very happy for the team because we had a really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion.\\" Lotterer said of the result: \\"It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track.\\" Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was \\"great\\" and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had \\"too many own goals\\" and that they did not wanted to be \\"gifted results\\" if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium. Following the first free practice crash between Nakajima and Jarvis, Davidson called for cars to be equipped with brighter flashing rain lights and that what happened to his co-driver was \\"every driver's worst nightmare\\". He suggested Formula One rain lights provided by McLaren Electronic Systems were brighter than those employed in the World Endurance Championship. Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing rain lights contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing rain lights at the rear of their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility. The result meant Lotterer, Fässler and Tréluyer increased their Drivers' Championship advantage to 14 points ahead of second- placed Lieb, Jani and Dumas. Wurz, Conway and Sarrazin moved from fourth to third with 22 points, three in front of their teammates Davidson and Buemi. Bernhard's, Webber's and Hartley's third-place finish meant they rounded out the top five with 17 points. Audi increased its lead in the Manufacturers' Championship on 70 points, 17 ahead of their nearest rivals Porsche in second, and a further six in front of third-placed manufacturer Toyota with six races left in the season.

The property was acquired by members of the Demidov family in the 1740s, in the middle of the reign of Tsarina Catherine II. The Demidov family grew rich from iron founding in the Urals. Nikita Akinfiyevich Demidov, grandson of the blacksmith and gun manufacturer Nikita Demidov, decided to rebuild the house. ==House== Floor plan A new house was built in brick faced with stone in 1776-80. The main house was similar in design to the Villa Capra but with canted corners. It has an octagonal main block of two storeys, with a cupola on a round central drum above a central circular hall. The estate is situated on a hill, with the main façades facing northwest, northeast, southeast and southwest. Each of the four main façades was dominated by a loggia decorated with four giant Tuscan columns spanning both main floors, with entablature and cornice above. Each canted corner had a single-storey entrance portico with two Ionic columns and balcony above, leading to a corner room, with diagonal corridors leading to the circular central hall. The house was surrounded at each diagonal by four identical two-storey rusticated pavilions, forming a cour d'honneur surrounded by a brick wall. The courtyard was surrounded by a landscaped park to the north, east and south. The southwestern entrance to the courtyard was decorated by two obelisks, which remain in place. A route through the park to the northeast towards the Desna River was decorated with sculptures, ending with a hill surmounted by a large statue of, originally, Catherine II and later replaced by one of Apollo, which was melted down in 1919. The main entrance was to the northwest, leading to the church of St. Peter the Metropolitan, where the tomb of Nikita Demidov is located. The model village of Petrovskoye was laid out nearby. ==History== The house was later acquired by Prince Nicolas Petrovich Meshchersky in the mid-19th century, and the Meshchersky family continued to hold the property at the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917. His daughter Princess Ekaterina Nicolaievna Meshchersky wrote about her life at Petrovskoye-Alabino. The house became a hospital after the Revolution. It suffered extensive damage in the 1930s, and there are rumours of a plan to blow up the house shortly before Russia was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941. Metalwork was removed for scrap during the Second World War. The area was fought over in late 1941 as the Germans attempted to seize Moscow. The building was in ruins before the beginning of the 21st century, leaving a brick shell with no internal floors or roof, and with only fragments of plaster and some limestone columns remaining. It has been given Russian Federation cultural heritage object number 5010311000. In recent years, descendants of the Meschersky family have attempted to reclaim the house.

He represented Burin in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1923 to 1924. The son of Samuel Harris, a merchant and ship owner, and Mary Forsey, he was born in Grand Bank and was educated there and at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick. After completing a business course, Harris joined his father's export firm. In 1914, he became managing director for the company. The company expanded rapidly but a decline in market conditions and changes in government regulations led to the firm declaring bankruptcy in 1923. Harris began work in another of his father's companies, Western Marine Insurance Company, later becoming its president. In 1904, he married Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Pitts Pratt, the sister of poet E. J. Pratt. Harris was elected to the Newfoundland assembly in 1923 as a Liberal-Labour- Progressive member. In 1924, his cousin Albert Hickman became premier and Harris transferred his support to the new government leader. He was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1924. Harris later campaigned in support of union with Canada. He was named Chief Returning Officer for the Canadian federal riding of Burin—Burgeo in 1949 and served in that position again for the federal election held in 1953. His former home, the George C. Harris House, was designated a Registered Heritage Structure in 1993. == References  External links == * Category:1879 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Newfoundland People's Party MHAs ","title":"George Chesley Harris"},{"id":"46393148","text":"McKinley House or McKinley Home may refer to: *Johnson Camden McKinley House, a historic house in Wheeling, West Virginia *McKinley Birthplace Home and Research Center, birthplace of U.S. President William McKinley ","title":"McKinley House"},{"id":"46393153","text":"Afdera orphnaea is a moth in the family Oecophoridae.

Karin Hildur \\"Kajsa\\" Ollongren (; born 28 May 1967) is a Swedish-Dutch politician serving as second Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands since 14 May 2020 and Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Third Rutte cabinet since 14 April 2020. She is a member of the Democrats 66 (D66) party. ==Personal life and education== Kajsa Ollongren was born on 28 May 1967 in Leiden to Jonkheer Alexander Ollongren, a Dutch East Indies-born astronomer and computer scientist, and his Swedish wife Gunvor Lundgren. Ollongren (originally Ållongren) is a Finnish-Swedish noble family which was incorporated into Dutch nobility in 2002, thereby giving her the noble predicate jonkvrouw. Ollongren grew up in Oegstgeest where she attended the secondary school Rijnlands Lyceum between 1979 and 1985. She then went to the University of Amsterdam, where she initially studied economics between 1985 and 1986, but switched her field of study in 1986 to history, in which she obtained an M.A. degree in 1991. She subsequently studied public administration at the École nationale d'administration in Paris and foreign relations at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael. Ollongren is married to Irene van den Brekel and they have two children. ==Career== Civil service Ollongren started her career in the civil service at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, becoming a policymaker in the area of Central and Eastern Europe there in 1992, in which capacity she trained young political parties of the newly established democracies in the area. She was head of parliamentary affairs within the ministry until 2001, and director of European Integration and Strategy from 2001 to 2004, and became Deputy Director General of the ministry in 2004. In 2007, she moved to the Ministry of General Affairs, the department headed by the Prime Minister, becoming Deputy Secretary General. She became Secretary General of the ministry in 2011. Local politics After the 2014 local election, in which the Democrats 66 became the largest party of Amsterdam and entered the city's government, Ollongren became an alderwoman and second deputy mayor in Amsterdam, taking office on 18 June 2014. Her portfolio as alderwoman was extensive, including economic affairs, seaport, airport, participation, art, culture, local media, monuments and the city centre. On 18 September 2017, the city's mayor Eberhard van der Laan announced in an open letter to the people of Amsterdam that he would step back from his public responsibilities due to ill health, leaving Kajsa Ollongren to exercise these responsibilities in his stead from 19 September onward. The day after his death, on 6 October, Ollongren became acting Mayor of Amsterdam. Minister of the Interior On 26 October 2017, Ollongren was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in Mark Rutte's third cabinet, succeeding Ronald Plasterk. She also became the second of the cabinet's three Deputy Prime Ministers, serving alongside Hugo de Jonge and Carola Schouten.PressReader - De Telegraaf: 2016-10-13 - 'MKB sleepte Nederland door crisis.

This was Spieth's sixth consecutive round with the lead at the Masters, tying the record set by Arnold Palmer in 1960–61. Amateur Bryson DeChambeau got to within a shot of the lead but suffered a triple bogey at the last to finish at even-par. Gusting winds led to difficult scoring conditions, with only four players (Daniel Berger, Dustin Johnson, McIlroy, and Troy Merritt) shooting under par, each shooting 71. The scoring average for the round was 75.02, the highest since 2007 and only seven golfers were under par after two rounds.

After a double bogey at the 11th, Spieth rebounded with birdies on three of his next four holes to take a four-shot lead, but then bogeyed the 17th and carded another double bogey on the 18th to post 73 (+1) and drop the lead to one. Smylie Kaufman recorded the lowest score of the round with 69 (−3) and moved into second place. Two-time champion Bernhard Langer, at age 58 attempting to become the oldest major champion, shot a round of 70 and tied Hideki Matsuyama for third, two shots back of Spieth.

Jordan Spieth birdied his final four holes of the front-nine to open up a five-shot advantage. After bogeys at the 10th and 11th, Spieth put two balls in the water on the par-3 12th and made quadruple bogey, dropping him to a tie for fourth. Willett, meanwhile, made birdie at 13 and 14 to take the lead. Lee Westwood chipped in for eagle at the 15th to get within one of Willett, but then made bogey on 16 while Willett made birdie. Willett made par on the last two holes to post a round of 67 and five-under for the tournament. After rebounding with birdies on 13 and 15, Spieth needed to birdie two of his last three holes to tie but missed a birdie at 16 then bogeyed 17 to fall out of contention. Spieth's downfall in the final round capped one of the biggest collapses in Masters history, with many comparing it to the meltdown of Greg Norman at the 1996 Masters. Dustin Johnson also made birdie on 13 and 15 to get within two of Willett, but made double bogey on the 17th.

By the time he was 22, Harris was captain of the Jennie S. Foote. By 1881, he owned his own vessels. He became partners with a brother-in-law in a retail outlet. In 1895, he set up his own exporting business, Samuel Harris Limited. Between 1881 and 1926, Harris owned more than 60 schooners. By 1915, his son George was handling the day-to-day operation of the business. A downturn in European markets following the end of World War I and a change in government regulations controlling the fishery resulted in the firm declaring bankruptcy in 1923. Harris became president of the restructured firm, now controlled by a consortium of its creditors. He also founded the Western Marine Insurance Company. He served on the Board of Works for Grand Bank and contributed most of the funds for the construction of the town's first hospital. Harris was married twice: first to Mary \\"Polly\\" Forsey in 1875 (she died in 1913) and then to Harriet Marion Harding in 1915.

He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC middleweight title since 2019 and the IBF junior middleweight title from 2015 to 2017. His identical twin brother, Jermell Charlo, is also a professional boxer and current world champion. As of April 2020, Jermall is ranked as the world's third best active middleweight by BoxRec, and fourth by The Ring magazine and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board. ==Early life and amateur career == Jermall is older than his identical twin Jermell by one minute.McCarson, Kelsey (November 26, 2015). \\"Jermall Charlo's Star Destined to Rise Due to Unmatched Work Ethic\\". Bleacher Report. Retrieved February 10, 2018. Both brothers are graduates of Alief Hastings High School in Houston, Texas. They began boxing when they started following their father, himself a former boxer, into the gym. As an amateur, Jermall was hopeful for a spot on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team but was forced to back out due to a toe injury. He competed in the amateur ranks for one more year and finished with a record of 65 wins and 6 losses. ==Professional career== Light middleweight Early years On August 12, 2008 Charlo made his professional debut against Cimmaron Davis and won the fight via 2nd-round technical knockout. On July 11, 2009 Charlo faced Deon Nash, the opponent his brother Jermell went up against and beat in 2008. Jermall won a comfortable unanimous decision victory and later fought Nash to a rematch on August 28, 2010 and Charlo would end up winning again by a corner retirement. On October 24, 2010 Charlo went up against Puerto Rican Carlos Garcia, whom his brother Jermell had fought a year prior. Both brothers beat Garcia by unanimous decision. Over the next five years, Charlo remained undefeated picking up wins over Orlando Lora, Antwone Smith and Norberto Gonzalez. By the close of 2014, Charlo had a record of 20 wins with 16 coming inside the distance and no losses. On March 28, 2015 Charlo went up against a highly talented prospect, Michael Kenneth Finney (12-2-1, 10 KOs) at The Pearl, Palms Casino in Las Vegas. Charlo won all of the rounds on all 3 judges scorecards and won a unanimous decision victory. The fight nearly came to an end a few times during the fight, however Finney managed to take Charlo the distance for the fifth time in his career. Charlo vs. Bundrage In May 2015, 42 year old Cornelius Bundrage (34-5, 19 KOs) was ordered by the IBF to make a mandatory title defense against Charlo. July 25 was a potential date discussed initially. On June 8, a few weeks prior to the fight taking place, Bundrage was forced to pull out of the fight citing an injury above his left eye. The card, which was scheduled to July 18 was postponed. The deep cut happened during a sparring session. On August 17, it was confirmed the fight would take place at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut on September 12. After an 18-month wait, Charlo dismantled Bundrage and captured the IBF light middleweight title with a dominating third-round knockout win. Bundrage was knocked down once in rounds 1 and 2 and twice in round 3. An overhand right put Bundrage down in round 1. Charlo never allowed Bundrage to get into the fight, constantly applying pressure. The second knockdown, which occurred in round 2 was from a left jab. Fast combinations to the head dropped Bundrage early in round 3 and a couple of minutes later, a final blow to the head. The referee did attempt to make a count and stopped the fight at 2 minutes and 33 seconds. After the fight, Bundrage said, \\"I hand't fought in (11 months), you can't be inactive fighting these young guys.\\" Charlo vs. Campfort A few weeks after winning the title, Charlo's trainer Ronnie Shields confirmed that Charlo would make his first defence against veteran Wilky Campfort (21-1, 12 KOs) on November 28, 2015 at The Bomb Factory in Dallas, Texas. Campfort's sole loss on his record came in his second professional fight via majority decision after 4 rounds. Shield's, who had been training both the twins, recently confirmed he would no longer be working with Jermell. He stated it was on good terms and it would not affect how Jermall would perform. Charlo floored Campfort in round 2 with a counter right hand. He recorded a second knockdown the following round after a flurry in the corner forced Campfort to take a voluntary knee. Towards the end of round 3 Charlo hit a perfect left uppercut clean to his left eye of Campfort's, compromising his vision was instantly to take a knee again. Despite beating the count, Campfort complained that he was unable to see, causing referee Mark Calo-Oy to wave off the fight. Over the 4 rounds, Charlo out landed Campfort 62-11, connecting on 30% of his power shots. After the bout, Charlo confirmed he would stay at light middleweight and continue to defend his title, however he wanted big fights. He also praised his jab, calling it the best in the business. Charlo vs. Trout On March 29, 2016, it was announced that Charlo would make a defence against former world champion Austin Trout (30-2, 17 KOs) at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 21. The card also included top light middleweights Erislandy Lara, Vanes Martirosyan and his brother Jermell. In a close contested bout, Charlo defeated Trout by a 12-round unanimous decision. The judges' scored the fight 115-113, 116-112, 116-112. Charlo landed the harder shots to dominate the action in the first six rounds. However, Charlo seemed to gas out a little in the second half of the fight, and was outworked by Trout. Trout suffered a cut over his right eye in the 10th round from a clash of heads but fought well despite suffering the cut. The crowd booed loudly when the scores were read out to let the judges know that they felt Trout should have won. Charlo landed 130 of 474 punches thrown (27%) and Trout landed 117 of his 490 thrown (24%). Trout received a purse of $300,000 and Charlo earned a purse of $500,000. Charlo vs. Williams Charlo's next title defense was set to be against the No. 1 contender Julian Williams (22-0-1, 14 KOs) on December 10, 2016 at the USC Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. The fight was pushed back as Charlo was nursing an eye injury and was given a 60-day medical extension by IBF. There were also rumours that Charlo would vacate the title to move up to middleweight. Charlo retained his IBF junior middleweight title with a fifth round stoppage of Williams. Charlo dropped Williams in the second round with a powerful jab. Williams came back and fought a clever fight, making Charlo miss, slipping punches, landing some good counters. In round 5, Charlo landed a right uppercut, dropping Williams hard. Williams got up, however Charlo went for the finish, and got it with a third knockdown after a barrage of punches ending with a left hook. After the referee stopped the fight, Williams went over to congratulate Charlo. Charlo didn't want to embrace and told Williams,\\"I don't want your congratulations, I want your apology.\\" The crowd noticing the heat between the two corners started to boo Charlo. In the post fight interview, Charlo stated Williams had disrespected him leading up to the fight, he also called out Canelo and Golovkin, stating he would move up to middleweight. The fight aired on Showtime and averaged 321,000 viewers, peaking at 370,000 viewers. Middleweight Charlo officially vacated his IBF light middleweight title on February 16, 2017 in order to move up to middleweight. Charlo had wanted to unify the light middleweight division, but there were no titlists available. At the time, twin Jermell, who Jermall had vowed not to fight, held the WBC title. He also stated after the Williams fight that he had been struggling to make weight. Charlo told ESPN, \\"It was either going to be a big fight for me at 154 pounds, like against Miguel Cotto or Canelo Alvarez, something big like that, or move up,\\" On March 11, WBC ranked Charlo number 2 ahead of David Lemieux and Curtis Stevens, who were ranked number 3 and 4 respectively. The IBF gave Charlo a number 3 ranking. In March 2017, it was reported by ESPN Deportes that an announcement would be made for Charlo to fight WBC number 1 ranked, Argentinian boxer Jorge Sebastian Heiland in a final eliminator. Charlo vs. Heiland On June 5, 2017 reports circulated around Argentina that WBC mandatory challenger Jorge Sebastian Heiland (28-4-2, 15 KOs) would be ordered to fight Charlo in a final eliminator. Heiland had been the mandatory since 2015. Early talks indicated the fight could take place on the undercard of the Mikey Garcia vs. Adrien Broner undercard. On June 9, the WBC officially ordered the fight between the two, with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger for the winner of Canelo Álvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin, which would take place in September 2017. The fight was officially announced on June 27. Charlo weighed in a career high 159.2 pounds while Heiland came in slightly lighter at 158.2 pounds. Charlo became the mandatory challenger for the WBC middleweight title, with a stoppage win over an injured Heiland in round 4. At the start of the fight, it was clear that Heiland's left leg was injured. Charlo first dropped Heiland in round 2 with a left to the head. In round 4, Charlo landed another left hook to the head which dropped Heiland again. Heiland beat the count, but as he was getting up, he stumbled around due to the injury. Referee Benji Esteves stopped the fight immediately at 2:13 of the fourth round to ensure Heiland took no more punishment. Charlo spoke to Showtime's Jim Gray in the post fight interview, \\"Sometimes the injury can be a decoy. You never want to just jump in and think it's part of his game plan. My coach [Ronnie Shields] told me to stay behind my job like I did, continue to work and it's gonna come.\\" The ringside doctor checked Heiland's leg before the fourth round but let the action continue. Heiland stated that his leg was okay before the fight and the injury occurred in the opening round. Charlo earned $350,000 compared to Heiland who had $200,000 purse. The fight drew an average 500,000 viewers and peaked at 542,000 viewers on Showtime. Charlo vs. Centeno On November 21, 2017 the WBC announced that Charlo would have the opportunity to claim the Interim WBC middleweight title against Hugo Centeno (26-1, 14 KOs). WBC President Maurcio Sulaiman explained the reason for this being due to the full WBC title being tied up in a potential rematch between Golovkin and Álvarez. A possible date in January 2018 was being discussed at the time. Due to negotiations not being made, on January 2, 2018 Sulaiman ordered the fight and confirmed it would be sanctioned by the WBC for the interim championship. On January 23, the fight was made official to take place on the undercard of Deontay Wilder's WBC heavyweight title defence against Luis Ortiz on March 3 at the Barclays Center. On February 23, the fight was postponed after Centeno injured his ribs in training. The fight was quickly rescheduled to take place on April 21 on the Adrien Broner vs. Jessie Vargas undercard. On fight night, in front of 13,964 in attendance, Charlo won the vacant WBC interim middleweight title after knocking out Centeno in round 2. The knockdown came when Charlo landed a left hook to the head followed by a right hand to Centeno. The fight was promptly halted by referee Steve Willis. The official time was at 0:55 of round 2. Charlo spend the first round stalking Centeno, who was reluctant to exchange. After the fight, Charlo said, \\"I'm a two-time world champion. Bring on Triple G! I want that fight! The networks [HBO and Showtime] and the teams can figure out how to get the Triple G fight done. I have the best manager [Al Haymon] in the world. I'm 27-0 with 21 knockouts. Everybody sees it. What more can I say?\\" CompuBox Stats showed that Charlo landed 12 of 35 punches thrown (34%) and Centeno landed 10 of his 31 thrown (32%). Charlo earned $500,000 to Centeno's $235,000 purse.  Charlo vs. Korobov  In October 2018, Premier Boxing Champions announced a doubleheader for December 22, 2018 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The card, which would be televised by FOX, would feature Jermell Charlo defending his WBC light middleweight title against Tony Harrison and Jermall Charlo defending his WBC interim middleweight title against former world title challenger Willie Monroe Jr. (23-3, 6 KOs). The twins flipped a coin to see who would close the show. The official press conference took place on October 25. On December 15, a week before the fight, it was reported that the WBC had been alerted of an adverse finding in Monroe's pre-fight drug test. It was reported that Russian boxer Matt Korobov (28-1, 14 KOs), who was scheduled to fight on the untelevised undercard against Juan DeAngel, stepped up to the challenge. Koborov, usually fighting at the light heavyweight limit, was dropping down to super middleweight to fight DeAngel, and now had six days to come down to 160 pounds from super middleweight. The WBC issued a statement confirmed Monroe would not be able to challenge Charlo for the title. They also confirmed the adverse finding was a banned steroidal substance. According to the sample collector, Monroe disclosed that he had used a non-specific “testosterone booster”, as written in the Doping Control Form, however did not request a 'therapeutic Use Exception' for the substance. Charlo vs. Korobov was confirmed on December 17. Korobov had only two pounds to lose as it was revealed the contracted weight limit for his fight against DeAngel was 162 pounds. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes - 31 Win 31–0 left;\\" Sergiy Derevyanchenko UD 12 Sep 26, 2020 left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 30 Win 30–0 left;\\" Dennis Hogan TKO 7 (12), Dec 7, 2019 left;\\" left;\\" - 29 Win 29–0 left;\\" Brandon Adams UD 12 Jun 29, 2019 left;\\" left;\\" - 28 Win 28–0 left;\\" Matt Korobov UD 12 Dec 22, 2018 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 27 Win 27–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Hugo Centeno Jr. KO 2 (12), Apr 21, 2018 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 26 Win 26–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Jorge Sebastian Heiland TKO 4 (12), Jul 29, 2017 left;\\"  - 25 Win 25–0 left;\\" Julian Williams KO 5 (12), Dec 10, 2016 left;\\" left;\\" - 24 Win 24–0 left;\\" Austin Trout UD 12 May 21, 2016 left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 23 Win 23–0 left;\\" Wilky Campfort TKO 4 (12), Nov 28, 2015 left;\\" left;\\" - 22 Win 22–0 left;\\" Cornelius Bundrage KO 3 (12), Sep 12, 2015 left;\\" left;\\" - 21 Win 21–0 left;\\" Michael Finney UD 10 Mar 28, 2015 left;\\"  - 20 Win 20–0 left;\\" Lenny Bottai KO 3 (12), Dec 13, 2014 left;\\"  - 19 Win 19–0 left;\\" Norberto Gonzalez TKO 7 (8), Sep 11, 2014 left;\\"  - 18 Win 18–0 left;\\" Hector Munoz RTD 4 (10) Apr 26, 2014 left;\\"  - 17 Win 17–0 left;\\" Joseph De los Santos KO 5 (8), Dec 13, 2013 left;\\"  - 16 Win 16–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Rogelio De la Torre TKO 7 (8), Sep 12, 2013 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 15 Win 15–0 left;\\" Antwone Smith KO 2 (10), Aug 9, 2013 left;\\"  - 14 Win 14–0 left;\\" Luis Hernandez TKO 2 (6), Jun 1, 2013 left;\\"  - 13 Win 13–0 left;\\" Orlando Lora RTD 4 (8), Apr 20, 2013 left;\\"  - 12 Win 12–0 left;\\" Gilbert Venegas KO 3 (8), Mar 2, 2013 left;\\"  - 11 Win 11–0 left;\\" Josh Williams RTD 5 (8) Jan 26, 2013 left;\\"  - 10 Win 10–0 left;\\" Edgar Perez RTD 4 (8) Dec 8, 2012 left;\\"  - 9 Win 9–0 left;\\" Sean Rawley Wilson TKO 5 (6), Mar 24, 2012 left;\\"  - 8 Win 8–0 left;\\" Eric Draper  1 (6), Sep 23, 2011 left;\\"  - 7 Win 7–0 left;\\" Deon Nash  2 (4), Aug 28, 2010 left;\\"  - 6 Win 6–0 left;\\" Carlos Garcia UD 4 Oct 24, 2009 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 5 Win 5–0 left;\\" Deon Nash UD 6 Jul 11, 2009 left;\\"  - 4 Win 4–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Terrell Davis TKO 2 (4), Jun 6, 2009 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 3 Win 3–0 left;\\" Anthony Bowman UD 4 Apr 25, 2009 left;\\"  - 2 Win 2–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Mario Hernandez  4 Oct 10, 2008 left;\\"  - 1 Win 1–0 left;\\" Cimarron Davis  2 (4), Aug 12, 2008 left;\\"  } ==References * *Jermall Charlo profile at Premier Boxing Champions Category:African-American boxers Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from Houston Category:Twin people from the United States Category:Twin sportspeople Category:American male boxers Category:International Boxing Federation champions Category:World light-middleweight boxing champions Category:Boxers from Louisiana Category:Boxers from Texas Category:Sportspeople from Lafayette, Louisiana Category:Middleweight boxers ","title":"Jermall Charlo"},{"id":"46393395","text":"Haiti Bride is a 2014 Caribbean arthouse film written, produced and directed by Trinidadian filmmaker Robert Yao Ramesar. Starring Tahina Vatel, Lentz F. Durand, Ketia Lerine, Fabienne Lerine, Joanne Francois, Enice Lerine and Pariza Domond, it tells the story of Marie Thérèse (Vatel), a Haitian-born woman who returns to her homeland to meet her husband Paul (Durand), who lost his memory after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. == Plot == Five years after her parents fled Haiti (following the 2004 coup d'état and subsequent removal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide) and re-settled in New York City, Marie Thérèse (Tahina Vatel) meets and falls in love with Paul (Lentz F. Durand), a Haitian man visiting the city. Despite her parents' objections, Marie accepts Paul's wedding proposal. They both decide to get married in Haiti on January 12, 2010 - the day that the 2010 Haiti earthquake took place. On Marie and Paul's first wedding anniversary, Marie returns to Haiti, where she proceeds to walk through Port-au-Prince in her wedding dress. Upon her arrival to the ruins of the cathedral where the wedding was held, she discovers three fragments of stained glass (colored red, blue and yellow) at the altar where Marie and Paul stood one year ago. In July 2012, Marie receives a call in New York from Paul, who is residing in Haiti. She requests that they meet in Port- au-Prince, where she intends to surprise him with the news that he is the father of her two-year-old son named Christophe. The turbulence experienced during the flight back to Haiti reminds Marie of the earthquake, and as a result, she contacts Paul upon her arrival, requesting that they meet in Cap- Haïtien (where initially they had planned to spend their honeymoon) instead of Port-au-Prince. Paul agrees to see Marie, but informs her that at the moment, he's \\"seeing friends\\". Through a brief voice-over narration by Paul, it is revealed that after the earthquake, he experiences difficulty in connecting with his emotions and confronting his past. After an unsuccessful attempt at recollecting his memories at the Port-au-Prince cathedral, Paul is transported to the commune of Jacmel on his friend's motorcycle. In Jacmel, three weeks prior to his reunion with Marie, Paul spends time with his lover and fiancée Natasha (Ketia Lerine). Natasha harbors feelings of mistrust for Paul, who left for New York after the earthquake, and spent three years there without having ever contacted her. Upon his return to Haiti, Paul proposed to Natasha, much to the disapproval of her mother (Enice Lerine) and sister (Fabienne Lerine). During his stay in Jacmel, he receives a still camera from Natasha's father, an elderly Voudon painter (Pariza Domond), which he eventually uses to take pictures of the city. In her voice-over narration, Natasha expresses her desire for Paul to, one day, do an exhibit of his photographs, thereby showcasing the beauty of her hometown. The following day, Natasha's father explains to Paul the inspiration behind one of his paintings, which depicts Paul and Marie in their wedding clothes on the altar of the cathedral. According to Natasha's father, the image of the wedding came to him in a dream he had on the day before the earthquake. He also reveals that he lost all his material possessions during the earthquake, with the exception of his paintbrush which he now uses to make his living as an artist. Days later, during a vehicular tour of Haiti, Paul and Marie finally reunite. While exploring an abandoned château during the tour, Marie converses with Paul. She informs him that their son Christophe is currently in the United States, while Paul reveals to her that he lost his memory after the earthquake. Meanwhile, a disenchanted Natasha sits on a rocking chair inside her home, caressing Paul's motorcycle helmet. Outside the house, Natasha's father stares at a blank canvas. With a pencil, he makes a light sketch. Suddenly, in a surrealistic, high-speed, monochrome-colored montage, all the preceding events in the film are shown in reverse. The montage concludes with a close-up of bride and groom cake toppers atop of a wedding cake before returning to the shot of Natasha's father and the blank canvas. The movie concludes with two scenes shown earlier: a shot of Marie and Paul (in their wedding clothes) standing within the ruins of the cathedral, followed by a scene where Marie stares at the three fragments of stained glass. == Production History == Haiti Bride was funded in part by a grant from the St. Augustine (Trinidad) campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI). The film’s inception also took place in UWI, when director Yao Ramesar had a chance meeting with Haitian exchange student, Tahina Vatel, whom he later cast as Marie in the film. The first screen tests, writing and pre-production took place on campus at a time when the University housed a number of to Haitian students whose education had been disrupted by the 2010 earthquake. == Release == The film's official premiere was at the UWI Film Building, St. Augustine, on September 19, 2014 during the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival.Haiti Bride - trinidad+tobago film festival == References  External links == * \\"Haiti Bride\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:2014 films Category:Films set in Haiti Category:Trinidad and Tobago films ","title":"Haiti Bride"},{"id":"46393397","text":"Martim Afonso de Melo (1360–1432) was a Portuguese nobleman, Lord of Arega and Barbacena.

In the November 4 general election she unseated the two-term Democrat Tommy Wren, 5,130 votes (54.3 percent) to 4,319 (45.7 percent). Representative Gray holds these committee assignments: (1) Legislative Joint Audit (2) Judiciary Committee, and (3) State Agencies and Governmental Affairs. In February 2015, Gray joined dozens of her fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. That same month Gray supported House Bill 1228, sponsored by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Democratic Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson.

Starting in 1922, he was a professor at the University of Breslau. In 1929 he became a professor at the University of Greifswald and in 1950, he started his professorship at the Humboldt- University of Berlin. The Bubnoff unit, which is the unit of measure for the speed of geological processes, is named after him. ==Family== Serge von Bubnoff was born in 1888 in Saint Petersburg (Russia) as the youngest son of Russian doctor, Nikolai Dementyevitch von Bubnoff (who would die a year later at the age of 52) and the German daughter of a businessman, Marie Henriette (née Türstig). His father worked as a military doctor and the personal physician of Prince Alexander von Oldenburg while his mother was an associate of the prince’s sister, Princess Theresa. His brother, Nikolai Nikolaiyevitch von Bubnoff, who was eight years his senior, taught philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. Serge von Bubnoff was married and father to two daughters. He died in 1957 at the age of 69 years old as the result of a heart attack and was buried in the cemetery of the evangelical Moravian Church in Niesky. ==Life== From his family’s living circumstances, he mastered Russian and German to a native level. Due to his congenital hearing defect, he was excused from compulsory military service. After his Abitur in Saint Petersburg, the family moved to Heidelberg in 1906. Serge von Bubnoff studied geology up to and including 1910 at the University of Freiburg at which he was given his doctorate in 1912 with a work about the tectonics of the section of the Dinkelberg located in Basel. Afterwards, he was employed by the University of Freiburg and at the Geological Regional Office of Baden, located in Freiburg. In 1914, he went to the University of Heidelberg. In 1921, Serge von Bubnoff qualified as a professor at the University of Breslau (to which he was named a tenured professor one year later) with a work on the hercynian fractures in the Black Forest. In 1929, he responded to a call from the University of Greifswald, where he functioned as a professor and director of the Geological-Paleontological Institute. After the end of World War II and the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Bubnoff became professor and director of the Geological-Paleontological Institute at Humboldt University in Berlin in 1950. Moreover, from 1950 until 1957, he directed the Geotechnical Institute of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. His Nachlass can be found in the archive of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of the Sciences. ==Research fields== Bubnoff’s scientific focuses were general, regional, and historical geology, the geology of Europe as well as geomorphology and economic geology. He paved the way for the cyclical theory of mountain formation. After World War II, he contributed significantly to the rebuilding of geological research in East Germany. ==Memberships== In August 1912 he was one of the 34 founding members of the Paleontological Society. ==Awards== From 1935, Serge von Bubnoff was a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina as well as corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and starting in 1949, a regular member of its successor institute, the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Moreover, in 1951, he was brought on as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen. Furthermore, in 1953 and 1955, he received the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic as well as the Gustav-Steinmann-Medaille from the Geological Association in 1954. He received an honorary doctorate from the Technical College of Hanover (currently: University of Hanover) in 1956. In 1948, he received the Leopold von Buch plaque. In the year after his death, the Geological Society of the German Democratic Republic, which had named him an honorary chairman in 1954, founded the Serge-von-Bubnoff-Medaille. This was taken over by the German Society for Geological Sciences and awarded for an \\"outstanding body of work done nationally or internationally.\\" In honor of Serge von Bubnoff, the Bubnoff unit (bub), the unit of measurement used for the speed of sedimentation, was named after him. A bub (B) is equivalent to one millimeter per 1,000 years or one meter every million years. ==Writings== * Die hercynischen Brüche im Schwarzwald, ihre Beziehung zur carbonischen Faltung und ihre Posthumität, Stuttgart, Schweizerbart 1921, (Phil.

The game is a crossover between various franchises from Bandai Namco, Capcom, and Sega, with special guests from Nintendo. The game was released in Japan in November 2015, and worldwide in February 2016. ==Gameplay== Like its predecessor, Project X Zone is a tactical role-playing game in which players strategically maneuver their characters across a field to battle with the enemy. Characters are paired up into Pair Units, with Solo Units consisting of a single character able to assist them when linked together. In battle, players use well-timed attacks and combos to do as much damage to the opponent as possible before their turn ends. ==Characters== Like its predecessor, Project X Zone 2 features pairs of characters from Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, and Sega, as well as solo characters who can provide assist attacks during combat. The game also features Nintendo characters as special guests for the first time. A total of 58 characters are playable in the game.https://kotaku.com/the-56-playable-characters-in-project- x-zone-2-1743472346  Pair units  * Reiji Arisu and Xiaomu from Namco × Capcom * Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima from Tekken * Kite and Haseo from .hack and .hack//G.U. * Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo from Tales of Vesperia * Ciel Alençon and Nana Kazuki from God Eater 2 * KOS-MOS and Fiora from Xenosaga and Xenoblade Chronicles * Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine from Resident Evil * Ryu and Ken Masters from Street Fighter * Demitri Maximoff and Morrigan Aensland from Darkstalkers * Dante and Vergil from Devil May Cry * X and Zero from Mega Man X * Strider Hiryu and Hotsuma from Strider and Shinobi * Chun-Li and Ling Xiaoyu from Street Fighter and Tekken * Akira Yuki and Kage-Maru from Virtua Fighter * Ichirō Ōgami and Erica Fontaine from Sakura Wars * Sakura Shinguji and Gemini Sunrise from Sakura Wars * Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima from Yakuza * Zephyr and Vashyron from Resonance of Fate * Chrom and Lucina from Fire Emblem Awakening  Solo units  * Heihachi Mishima from Tekken * Natsu from Soulcalibur V * Aty from Summon Night 3 * Valkyrie from Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu * Alisa Illinichina Amiella from God Eater * Estellise Sidos Heurassein from Tales of Vesperia * Captain Commando from Captain Commando * June Lin Milliam from Star Gladiator * Leon S.

Before its expiration, Project X Zone 2 was announced early to attendees of Bandai Namco's \\"Level Up\\" press event in Milan, Italy on April 10, which was prematurely posted on Italian news website E-duesse before being retracted. The game was officially revealed to the public three days later. It was confirmed in an interview that the game will address the criticisms of the original (such as the story) and that there will be some \\"surprise\\" announcements. The game was originally going to have a simultaneous worldwide release, but the North American and European releases were later delayed to early 2016. Unlike the previous game, the western versions features no altered content from the Japanese version and are in multiple languages. ==Reception== Project X Zone 2 received mixed to positive reviews, receiving a score of 73/100 on Metacritic, with critics praising the game's cast of characters and improvements to issues present in the first game, but criticizing the game's easy difficulty and the fact that many assets were reused from the first game. The game received a 32/40 from Famitsu. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5 saying, \\"Project X Zone 2 is a funny, charming and amusing title. It sets out to entertain video game fans of all stripes and allows the player to jump from world to world to get a taste of other titles they may have been missing. Just based on the built-in \\"Crosspedia\\" encyclopedia database, the stack of games that I really want to try out has grown (Resonance of Fate, in particular). It's not challenging, but it was never meant to be. The gameplay is simply the vehicle to deliver the true focus of this title: dumb fun. Players who don't need everything to bristle with a dark malevolence will find a great time in this one.\\" Sales The game sold 37,000 copies in Japan on its first week, selling through 60% of its shipment. The game made the #2 spot in the UK 3DS sales charts. ==Other media== In an interview with Nintendo Life, Kensuke Tsukanaka stated that he would like to continue the series. Hideki Kamiya of PlatinumGames has stated he was approached about having Sega character Bayonetta included in this game, to which he refused as he wanted Bayonetta and Dante from Devil May Cry to meet \\"on his own terms\\". However, he has stated he has come to regret this decision due to realizing how the fans would have loved the two interacting, and that if there is a Project X Zone 3 he would be all for Bayonetta's inclusion. ==NotesReferences * Category:2015 video games Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Capcom games Category:Crossover video games Category:Fictional government investigations of the paranormal Category:Monolith Soft games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Nintendo games Category:Roppongi Category:Sega video games Category:Shibuya Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Urban fantasy video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games featuring parallel universes Category:Video game sequels ","title":"Project X Zone 2"},{"id":"46393599","text":"WKCJ is a Classic Hits and Oldies formatted broadcast radio station licensed to White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, serving Lewisburg and Union in West Virginia and Covington in Virginia.

He spent his youth in New Orleans, where he performed alternative music before moving to Los Angeles with his family in August 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. ==Coldwater== With no prior acting credits, P. J. Boudousqué was cast in the lead role after reading two scenes. After Coldwater he won roles in American Horror Story (2013), Bones (2014), and Ascension (2014). Boudousqué had been auditioning in vain in Hollywood and said he almost gave up on acting just before getting the call for Coldwater, auditioning for the film shortly before moving to New York City. In New York he was planning to study in theater intensives, but after two weeks found out that he had booked the film and had to return to Hollywood. Boudousqué's performance in Coldwater was universally praised by critics. Don Simpson writing for 'Smells Like Screen Spirit' is typical of the accolades Boudousqué received for his work in the film: > \\"Boudousqué handles the emotionally dark subject matter with an eerie sense > of quietness. As Coldwater showcases the inability of teenagers to > communicate their thoughts and feelings, Boudousqué truly embodies this > theme. There is a certain something about Boudousqué's performance that > reminds me of Ryan Gosling's performance in Drive (and I cannot think of > much higher accolades than that!). Without Boudousqué or Gosling ever > telling us what is going on in their minds, we know that something is > festering deep down inside of them. On the surface, their characters may > seem like nice wholesome guys with boyish charms and good looks; we would > never guess that they are hiding their violent tendencies, that is until we > witness that firsthand.\\" Almost every reviewer noted the uncanny similarities between Boudousqué and actor Ryan Gosling both in looks and acting style. In France, the company that acquired distribution rights to Coldwater (KMBO) built an entire marketing campaign around Boudousqué's resemblance to the star. ==References * Category:Living people Category:Male actors from New Orleans Category:21st-century American male actors Category:American male film actors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"P.

It can be also related to the act of working beyond one's strength or capacity, causing physical and/or mental distress in the process. Compulsory, mandatory, or forced overtime is usually defined as hours worked in excess of forty hours per week “that the employer makes compulsory with the threat of job loss or the threat of other reprisals such as demotion or assignment to unattractive tasks or work shifts.\\" == Voluntary overwork == Voluntary overtime is work which the employer may ask the worker to do but which the worker is not required to work unless he agrees at the time to do so. == Compulsory overwork == Compulsory overwork is that where the individual has no choice but to work more than their capacity. In other words, compulsory overwork is the lack of control that workers exercise over the boundary between work time and private time. == Consequences == Forced overtime, heavy workloads, and frenetic work paces give rise to debilitating repetitive stress injuries, on-the-job accidents, over-exposure to toxic substances, and other dangerous work conditions. Nevertheless, some studies are beginning to show the costs of compulsory overwork. Reg Williams and Patricia Strasser, professors of nursing at the University of Michigan, estimated in the journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses that the total cost of depression at work was as high as $44 billion. They pointed out that healthcare workers have focused much attention on the workplace risk factors for heart disease, cancer, obesity, and other illnesses, but little emphasis on the risk factors for depression, stress, negative changes in personal life, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Annual average work hours for Americans have risen from 1,679 in 1973 to 1,878 in 2000. This represents an increase of 199 hours—or approximately five additional weeks of work per year. This total work effort represents an average of nine weeks more than European workers. Therefore, it is within this logic of working more to gain more that workers are living a very hectic and tiring time to provide their families. The result in reality is an excess that does not often translate into high salaries. There are categories of workers where the work and the environments are unhealthy turning the most vulnerable workers and sentenced to fatigue and even living less.  Emotional effects  The emotional impacts of overwork can vary, depending on the amount of work, levels of pressure and competition in the work space. Employees who worry about not getting work finished and keeping up a fast pace can feel like they are drowning in their workload, a feeling that manifests itself in chronic stress and anxiety, which can hebetate the spirit and create tension in personal and work relationships. The behavior continues even if the worker becomes aware that it is personally harmful — even harmful to the quality of the work. The stress that goes along with working too much has been shown to lead to substance abuse, sleep disorders, anxiety and ultimately to physical problems.  Physical effects  One of the key indicators that an individual is being overworked, and not merely challenged, is if work-related stress begins to take a toll on their physical health and general lifestyle. It is easy to distinguish different types of physical symptoms, such as getting sick frequently due to a weakened immune system, depression and insomnia. All these symptoms can cause more fatigue-related errors at work and affect their personal lives. According to the Mayo Clinic, other physical symptoms may include headache, neck pain, lower back pain, depression, changes to appetite and chronic fatigue. ==By country==  United States  Compulsory overtime and overwork present a growing \\"convergence\\" between workers regardless of their occupation, income, education, race, gender, or citizenship. For example, in the United States, immigrants and other low-wage workers toil excessive hours in traditional sweatshops, such as garment factories, restaurants and other industry sectors. At the same time, exposés of \\"white-collar\\" and \\"electronic\\" sweatshops debunk the glamour of high-tech employment revealing large numbers of higher-paid skilled workers who work upwards of seventy to ninety hours a week under increasingly autocratic conditions. With the steep rise in annual work hours for individuals and families, more than half of American workers report feeling overworked, overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do, and/or lacking in time to reflect upon the work they are doing. Overwork is attributable to several trends. First, the climb in annual family work hours since 1979 has coincided with an era of stagnant and falling wages. Annual family work hours have swelled primarily because unprecedented numbers of women have entered the full-time workforce, and those who were already in the workforce have taken on increased hours of work to boost family incomes. Without the increased work hours of women, lower-and middle-income families would have seen their incomes fall or at best remain stagnant. African American and Latino families, whose average hours of work grew faster than white families throughout the 1980s and 1990s, would have been especially hard hit. Many immigrant workers are faced with the stark choice of complying with required overtime, increased workloads, and frenetic work paces, or being fired. Workers are pressured to compete with one another for longer hours to keep their jobs and avoid being replaced by workers who are more compliant with employer demands. Undocumented immigrant workers are particularly susceptible to demands for excessive hours. The threat of deportation, along with the criminalization of their work status, creates a climate of vulnerability that unscrupulous employers use to cheapen labor and extract more work.  Japan  The problem of overwork in Japan has become so acute that the term karōshi, translated as \\"overwork death\\". It is described as occupational sudden mortality. The government estimates that 200 people die from karōshi every year because of heart attacks, strokes and cerebral hemorrhages due to a poor diet and long hours spent at the workplace. However, karōshi does not include deaths from mental depression or suicides. If this were the case, the number of work-related deaths would dramatically increase. Data compiled by the Japanese government shows that 22 percent of the public work more than 49 hours a week, compared to 11 percent of French and Germans. Workers typically used less than half of their leave allowance in a year, according to a survey by the labour ministry which found that in 2013 employees took only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement. A separate poll showed that one in every six workers took no paid holidays at all in 2013. In early discussions, employer groups proposed limiting the number of compulsory paid holidays to three days, while unions called for eight. In 2016, the Japanese government finally decided to do something about the endemic culture of overwork, which has been blamed not just on a growing number of deaths, but also the country's critically low birth rate and declining productivity. Although Japan is notorious for hard work, it's equally known for inefficiency and bureaucracy. Workers sit around in the name of team spirit, despite questionable performance.  China  Overwork is reported to be a major issue in China. The Chinese manufacturing industry is well known for forcing young children to work long hours in production sweatshops. It is reported that about 12.9% of employees work more than 10 hours of overtime a week in China, in fact, Chinese employees work nearly 50 hours in one work week.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/02/WS5bdbdf4ca310eff303286339.html It is also reported that every year in China, more than half a million people die from overwork.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-12/11/content_27635578.htm  South Korea  According to OECD data, Koreans work 2,024 hours a year, ranking third in the world among OECD countries.This is 280 hours longer than the OECD average of 1,744 hours. Also, according to a survey conducted by Job Korea, South Korean office workers worked an average of 2.5 days a week, with an average night shift of 2 hours and 30 minutes per night. However, only 37.7 percent of the office workers said they would receive overtime pay. As a result of such overwork, 95 percent of Korean office workers suffer from \\"burnout syndrome\\" (a phenomenon in which people who were motivated to work suffer from extreme physical and mental fatigue and become lethargic). This working environment has also killed workers. About 300 workers died of cerebral cardiovascular disease, a typical type of overwork, in the 2017 industrial accident statistics. It accounts for 37.1 percent of 808 workers who died of work-related illnesses. Problems caused by overwork are getting bigger and bigger in Korea. To counter this problem of overwork, the government is working on a policy of measures. As a precautionary measure, the medical institution implements 'long-term guidelines for health management of workers', 'evaluation of the risk of developing diseases for prevention of cerebrovascular diseases', and the operation of 'worker health centers'. And after overwork, the company operates the industrial insurance system and paid vacation system as safety nets. In addition, it has passed a revision to the Labor Standards Act of 52 hours per week, guaranteeing the lives of workers and enhancing labor productivity. The \\"52 hours per week\\" is a law applied from July 1, 2018, which reduces the maximum weekly working hours from 68 hours to 52 hours. However, a year after the law went into effect, the policy effect of the labor system does not appear to be working well yet in 2019. According to a survey of 1,170 workers who quit their jobs at Job Korea in 2019, 23.2 percent chose working overtime and life impossible to separate from work as reasons for leaving the company, which was the top reason for leaving the company. In the same survey conducted in 2018, 'My Future Vision Looks Low' was chosen as the top reason for leaving the company. Compared to 2018, frequent overtime topped the list of resignations in 2019, apparently due to the same or increased actual working hours, although the official working hours have decreased since the implementation of the 52-hour workweek. However, there are also positive changes due to shorter working hours. According to the tally by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the average leisure time for people in 2018 was 5.3 hours on weekends and 3.3 hours on weekdays, up 0.3 hours each from the latest tally of 2016. The average monthly leisure cost also rose 15,000 won to 151,000 won during the same period.[17] \\"Because the 52-hour work system was implemented in July 2018, and there is virtually no punishment, it is still difficult for the 52-hour work system to have a policy effect,\\" said Kim Yoo-sun, president of the Korea Labor and Social Institute. As for cases where only working hours are reduced and the workload remains the same, he said, \\"At first, the goal was to create jobs by reducing working hours, but now the government seems to focus only on reducing working hours and not trying to nurture jobs. As it was a fully anticipated side effect, the government needs to actively manage the job issue as well.\\"  Government and policy markers  *Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)xz *International Labour Organization (ILO) ==See also== *Chronic fatigue syndrome *Effects of fatigue on safety *Labor rights *Occupational burnout *Occupational safety and health *Occupational stress *Overachievement *Right to rest and leisure *Sleep-deprived driving *Workaholic ==References== Category:Occupational safety and health Category:Working time Category:Labor relations ","title":"Overwork"},{"id":"46393835","text":"Peter Schivarelli (born 1945 in Chicago) is the manager of the rock band Chicago.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chicago-on-rock-and-roll-hall- of-fame-reuniting-with-peter-cetera-20151217 He was previously Chicago chief of snow command, former sanitation superintendent of Chicago's 43rd ward, and former owner of Demon Dogs, a popular hot dog stand in Lincoln Park, Chicago.

The Field Services Division It is also known as the Patrol Division is staffed by 20 officers, 4 agents, 4 sergeants and headed up by a captain and primarily responds to emergencies and non-emergencies within the City of Campbell. On occasion officers will respond to calls for assistance from the neighboring jurisdictions of San Jose and Los Gatos/Monte Sereno. The Special Enforcement Division This division has two groups that fall under the title. Both equally important, they are: the Investigative Services Unit and the Traffic Unit. The Investigative Services Unit conducts follow-up on crimes that have been committed with the goal of subduing the suspects and helping the District Attorney's Office successfully prosecuting them. The unit is composed of one sergeant and five investigators and is overseen by a captain. The main areas of specialization are robbery and homicide, sexual assaults, and property and financial crimes. The investigative unit also participates in SCCSET or the Santa Clara County Specialized Enforcement Team which is a regional task force. The Traffic Unit is responsible for enforcing traffic laws, investigating traffic accidents and road closures for special events. Many of the main jobs include the NTMP or Neighborhood Traffic Management Program, parking enforcement, especially around Campbell's downtown area, and the SCC Avoid the 13 Campaign. Most of the officers assigned to this unit are placed on motorcycles. This includes one sergeant, an agent and 2 to 3 officers. Crossing guards are also under the command of the sergeant in this division as are Community Service Officers. Recently the motorcycle officers participated in the motorcade for fallen Officer Michael Johnson of neighboring San Jose Police Department. Support Services Division This division is made up of the Records Unit, Communications Unit and the Property and Evidence Unit. Communications is also known as dispatch and is the Public Safety Answering Point for Campbell. This means that all calls to 911 are answered by the staff of this unit.

It was premiered at the Comédie des Champs-Élysées in Paris on February 21, 1920, conducted by Vladimir Golschmann. Satie later arranged it for piano duet and today it is more frequently heard in this version. A typical performance lasts about five minutes. ==Background== François Rabelais (1494-1553) Satie was well-read in humorous and imaginative literature, and the figure of Rabelais loomed large in his bohemian youth. The 16th Century French satirist was an idol of the early Montmartre cabaret scene. At the Chat Noir, where Satie played piano in the late 1880s, a drinking cup allegedly belonging to the author was on reverent display.Harper's Magazine, Volume 78, 1889, p. 702. Recalling those days in a 1922 essay, Satie went so far as to claim that one of his great- uncles used to \\"bend the elbow\\" with Rabelais at the legendary Pomme de Pin tavern in Paris.In his essay \\"Painful Examples\\" (Catalogue No. 5, October 1922). See Nigel Wilkins (ed.), \\"The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, pp. 121-122. Apart from a song about the Mad Hatter, Le chapelier from his cycle Trois Mélodies (1916), the only comic literary characters Satie evoked in his music were the endlessly hungry and boozing giants Gargantua and his son Pantagruel.Among Satie's unrealized projects were ballets based on La Fontaine's Fables and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Food and eating were frequent themes of Satie's own extramusical humor. His poverty made him all too familiar with hunger at times,In letters to his brother Conrad during the Spring of 1899 Satie noted \\"I haven't eaten for two days\\" and \\"an empty stomach, a parched throat, give me no pleasure whatsoever.\\" In similar straits 20 years later he wrote to Valentine Hugo, \\"I'm sick of this beggar's life.\\" See Ornella Volta (ed)., \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 78, and \\"Erik Satie: Correspondance presque complete\\", Fayard, Paris, 2003. leading to his wry observation, \\"It's odd. You'll find someone in every bar willing to buy you a drink. No one ever dreams of presenting you with a sandwich.\\"Renée Lanser, \\"Notes et souvenirs - Erik Satie\\", Matin d'Anvers, 9 July 1925. According to his brother Conrad, the composer's appetite was gargantuan on those occasions when he was able to eat to his heart's content: he could devour a 30-egg omelette or 150 oysters in one sitting.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 15. His affinity for the bawdy, food- obsessed Rabelais is made clear in the Trois petites pièces montées. ==Composition history== In November 1919, the young cookery historian Bertrand GuéganBertrand Guégan (1892-1943) was an editor for the publisher Éditions de la Sirène, which had Satie under exclusive contract in the early 1920s. His notable culinary works include La Fleur de la Cuisine Française (2 volumes, 1921), a collection of French recipes ranging from the 13th Century to the modern era; the first French translation of the Ancient Roman cookbook Apicius (1933), for which the Académie française awarded him the 1934 Prix Langlois; and Le cuisinier français (1934). He also edited a critical edition of Molière (7 volumes, 1925-1929). During World War II Guégan took part in the French Resistance and was executed by the Nazis. See http://data.bnf.fr/11906122/bertrand_guegan/ asked Satie to set a poem to music for his Almanach de Cocagne (Cockaigne Almanac), an annual publication \\"dedicated to true gourmets and serious drinkers.\\"Guégan's Almanach de Cocagne appeared annually from 1920 to 1922. Along with classic recipes it featured essays, artwork and even music scores from prominent French creative figures. For the 1922 edition Satie contributed an essay, \\"The Table\\", in which he fondly recalled his weekly lunches with Debussy. See Ornella Volta (editor), \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), p. 121. Satie claimed the deadline was too short for him to do the job properly and instead submitted a brief fanfare-like march for 2 trumpets, giving it the title Marche de Cocagne. As musical fanfares had been used to announce the courses of luxurious French banquets since the Middle Ages,http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403400410.htmlD. Eleanor Scully, Terence Scully, \\"Early French Cookery: Sources, History, Original Recipes and Modern Adaptations\\", University of Michigan Press, 2002, pp. 319-320. his offering was in keeping with the gastronomic and historical themes of Guégan's journal. It would appear as the frontispiece of the Almanach, with a woodcut illustration by Raoul Dufy, in 1920. This was the nucleus of the Trois petites pièces montées. Jean Cocteau Jean Cocteau, who at that time was presenting himself as a propagandist for the esprit nouveau of postwar French music, then invited Satie to participate in a theatrical event he was organizing for the end of the Paris winter season. Enthralled with Darius Milhaud's new score for Le bœuf sur le toit, he had persuaded the wealthy French nobleman Count Étienne de Beaumont to book the Comédie stage of the Théâtre des Champs- Élysées for a week of performances, and now he needed to fill out the rest of the program.http://daniellathompson.com/Texts/Le_Boeuf/boeuf.pt.15-16.htm. Quotes from Milhaud's autobiography Notes sans Musique (1949) in which he describes how Cocteau \\"improvised\\" the entire concert around Le Boeuf sur le toit. His original plan was to include Satie's yet unperformed Cinq grimaces pour Le songe d'une nuit d'été, composed in 1915 for Cocteau's unrealized Cirque Medrano production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.The Cinq Grimaces pour Le songe d'une nuit d'été would not be performed in Satie's lifetime. It was published posthumously in 1929. Satie wrote to Milhaud with a different idea: :\\"My Dear Friend - I am so sorry: the Grimaces are written for too large an orchestra. If you like, I could write Trois petites Marches - including the Marche de Cocagne - for small orchestra, with a duration of 10 minutes...\\"Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie's Letters to Milhaud and Others\\", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 66, No. 3 (Jul., 1980), p. 418. Wilkins gives the date of Satie's letter as \\"January 1, 1919\\", but this is clearly mistaken. This proposal was accepted and Satie began composition in December 1919. How the \\"Three Little Marches\\" evolved into a Rabelais-themed suite with an overtly satirical finale is a mystery, as Satie was secretive about what motivated him to compose. His intentions may have been the subject of a note he sent Milhaud on January 10, 1920, while the work was still in progress: \\"Come tomorrow, and...'Don't give anything away.' Not a word to ANYBODY, above all: 'Don't give anything away.' SERIOUS.\\"Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 499. In his book \\"Satie the Bohemian\\" (1999), Steven Moore Whiting detailed Satie's uneasy relations with Cocteau and suspected that the concluding Coin de Polka, with its suggestions of Rabelaisian obscenity and \\"heavy-handed\\" music hall-style humor, was \\"a caricature of Cocteau's whole enterprise.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 499. The short score for the pièces montées was completed on January 3, 1920 and the orchestration by January 24, when Satie informed Milhaud, \\"I have finished - Happy am I.\\"Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie's Letters to Milhaud and Others\\", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 66, No. 3 (July 1980), pp. 404-428. ==Music and literary themes== The common English translation of Satie's collective title, Three Little Stuffed Pieces, loses much of the punning of the original French. A pièce montée is an edible patisserie sculpture made from sugar and other confections, and serves as a centerpiece at a formal banquet; \\"pièce\\" can also refer to a short musical composition, and the verb monter variously means \\"mount\\", \\"climb\\", \\"to stuff\\", or \\"go uphill\\". The pieces differ in style and tone and no attempt is made to link them musically, although the bassoon plays a prominent role in Nos. 1 and 3. Yet there is a sense of \\"mounting\\" excitement as the music progresses from the gentle Rêverie and the more extrovert Marche to the raucous Coin de Polka. The titles of the outer pieces are chapter headings from Gargantua and Pantagruel, which serve as subtexts for those familiar with Rabelais; the music itself does not follow a literal program. Satie scored the suite for a standard music hall ensemble of 25 players (excluding the tuba): 1 flute, 1 oboe, 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon, 1 horn in F, 2 trumpets in C, 1 trombone, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, and strings (1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, and double basses). It is dedicated to Madame Julien Henriquet. Gustave Doré, The Infancy of Pantagruel (1873) 1\\\\. De l'enfance de Pantagruel (The Infancy of Pantagruel) - Rêverie In Book 2, Chapter 4 of Gargantua and Pantagruel, Rabelais describes how the enormous baby Pantagruel drank the milk of 4600 cows straight from the source at each feeding, and was chained to his cradle to keep him from shoving the animals into his mouth. Despite the restraints he figures out how to walk and follows his nose into the royal banquet hall, carrying the cradle on his back \\"like a tortoise climbing up a wall\\". Gargantua frees him and rules that Pantagruel in now big enough to dine with the grown-ups. The designation Rêverie notwithstanding, Satie's music is quietly lyrical rather than dreamlike. It has a detached quality not far removed from his previous compositions, the piano Nocturnes (1919), a series he curtailed to write this suite.The Nocturne No. 5 is dated November 1919. Satie abandoned an almost complete draft of No. 6, along with a harmonic plan for No. 7 and sketches for other possible pieces in the series. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 194-198, 317-318. Satie imbues it with a certain ponderousness by giving the main theme of the A section to the bassoon over an undulating string ostinato, and by what pianist Olof Höjer described as \\"a heavy-footed, bloated quality in its movement pattern.\\"Olof Höjer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. In the recapitulation the bassoon theme is extended through repetition and a cadential phrase. 2\\\\. Marche de Cocagne (Cockaigne March) - Démarche Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Land of Cockaigne (1567) Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty in Medieval and Renaissance literature, where the skies rained custard, rivers of wine flowed beneath mountains of butter and cheese, and laziness was rewarded. Rabelais does not mention Cockaigne directly but satirizes the premise at various points of Gargantua and Pantagruel,Robert Appelbaum, \\"Aguecheek's Beef, Belch's Hiccup, and Other Gastronomic Interjections: Literature, Culture, and Food Among the Early Moderns\\", University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 136. notably in Book IV, in which Pantagruel visits an island whose inhabitants (called \\"gastrolators\\") worship the belly as their only god. The myth later became a metaphor for gluttony and excess. In Satie's time \\"Cockaigne\\" was a jocular nickname for Paris as well as London.Frank Moore Colby, Talcott Williams (ed.), New International Encyclopedia, Dodd, Mead, 1918, p. 532.Composer Edward Elgar wrote his Cockaigne Overture (1901) about London and Londoners. The Marche de Cocagne is an exercise in Neoclassical music. The opening reproduces the original 8-bar trumpet duet, while the central section is a stately little processional led by the strings très chanté (\\"very song-like\\").All performance indications quoted in this article are from the original 1921 score available at http://imslp.org/wiki/3_Petites_pi%C3%A8ces_mont%C3%A9es_(Satie,_Erik) An imposing slow roll on the bass drum suggests the arrival of something big, which turns out to be a triumphant restatement of the trumpet theme by most of the ensemble (except for the horn and percussion). 3\\\\. Jeux de Gargantua (Gargantua's Games) - Coin de Polka Doré's depiction of the young Gargantua After the relative earnestness of the preceding two movements, the humorist in Satie takes center stage in this \\"bit of a polka\\" bearing the title of Book 1, Chapter 22 of Gargantua. Most of that chapter is devoted to a long list of games young Gargantua enjoyed after meals, among them such amusements as \\"Plunder\\", \\"Torture\\", \\"Rape the Ox\\", \\"Shit in His Beard\\", and \\"Salvo of Farts.\\"These were names of actual games (often involving cards or dice) played in 16th Century France, but Rabelais' mischievous wit allows the uninformed to interpret them literally. For added piquancy he notes them alongside backgammon, chess, and children's classics like Blind Man's Buff and Hide and Seek. Historian Yves Rifaux identified 190 of the 215 games on Rabelais' list. See http://www.ecole-alsacienne.org/CDI/pdf/1301/130220_RIF.pdfWhiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 499 (footnote).Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Trois petites pièces montées\\", 2009, A droll oom-pah-pah-like phrase introduces a farrago of musical clichés from the French fairground, cabaret and circus,Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 499. in particular the exaggerated percussion effects (snare drum rolls, bass drum-cymbal crashes) that come in at seemingly arbitrary moments of the music. This is followed by an unaccompanied exchange between clarinet and bassoon, instructed to play niaisement (\\"stupidly\\") by the composer. The bassoon, initially content to mimic the clarinet's three-note mutterings, soon dominates the tête-à-tête. Both instruments are cut off by four flatulent-sounding blasts from the trombone (marked \\"blow without attack\\" in the score) and the full orchestra hastens the suite to a bombastic conclusion. ==Reception== Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, site of the premiere of Trois petites pièces montées. The separate entrance to the Comédie theatre is at right Cocteau's \\"Premiere Spectacle-Concert\\", as he called his musical event, opened before a select audience at the Comédie des Champs- Élysées on February 21, 1920. Its theme was the glorification of French popular culture, as represented by the newly baptized composers of Les Six and their \\"master\\" Erik Satie.Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Trois petites pièces montées\\", 2009. The program consisted of an Overture and the song cycle Cocardes (to Cocteau texts) by Francis Poulenc; Adieu, New York!, a foxtrot by Georges Auric performed onstage by two acrobats; Satie's pièces montées; and Le bœuf sur le toit. Although the fully staged \\"pantomime farce\\" Le bœuf ultimately dominated the show, the audience responded so favorably to Satie's suite that conductor Golschmann encored it twice.Louis Laloy, Comoedia, 23 February 1920, 2. Music critic Laloy (no fan of Satie's) opined that after the \\"rough\\" offerings of Poulenc and Auric the pièces montées seemed like \\"a delicious refreshment,\\" but the encores only exposed the suite's \\"amiable banality.\\" A second performance was held as a benefit for disabled war veterans on February 23 and three more (including a matinee) took place on February 25 and 28, 1920.Le Figaro announcement, February 18, 1920. Satie arranged the suite for piano 4-hands and made a separate arrangement of the first piece for solo piano under the title Rêverie de l'enfance de Pantagruel; both were published by Éditions de la Sirène in 1920. On December 19 of that year the composer and pianist André SalomonAndré Salomon (1881-1944) was a French-Jewish pianist and teacher associated with Satie's music of the World War I and postwar eras, including performances of the musique d'ameublement (\\"furniture music\\"). Satie dedicated the second of his Nocturnes to him. Salomon perished in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War II. See http://data.bnf.fr/15731335/andre_salomon/ premiered the duet version during an all-Satie concert at the Galerie la Boétie in Paris. Éditions de la Sirène brought out the original orchestral score in 1921. Notable performances of the Trois petites pièces montées during Satie's lifetime include conductor Gabriel Pierné's rendition with the Concerts Colonne on December 17, 1921,Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Satie and the French Musical Canon: A Reception Study\\", University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, 2013, p. 346. and Vladimir Golschmann's four presentations in concerts sponsored by the Ballets suédois (October 25 to 31, 1923). https://sites.google.com/site/rogerdesormiere18981963/concerts- representations/annees-20 In June 1924, choreographer Leonide Massine assembled two of Satie's piano duets, Trois morceaux en forme de poire (1903) and the keyboard reduction of the pièces montées, into the ballet Premier Amour for the Soirées de Paris stage company at the Théâtre de la Cigale. It was a solo number starring Lydia Lopokova as a girl who dreams she falls in love with a doll. Satie and Marcelle Meyer played the piano during its handful of performances.Leslie Norton, \\"Leonide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet\\", McFarland, 2004, p. 98.Sally Banes, \\"Writing Dancing in the Age of Postmodernism\\", Second Edition, Wesleyan University Press, 2011, Part II, Chapter 8. Since Satie's death the original version of the suite has been largely neglected, even by conductors (Maurice Abravanel, Michel Plasson) who committed much of his modest orchestral catalog to disc.Abravanel, in his pioneering 2-disc set of Satie's orchestral music with the Utah Symphony (Vanguard, 1968), recorded arrangements of the piano pieces made by others (Debussy, Milhaud, Poulenc, Désormière) but passed over an orchestral work that was 100% Satie. ==Recordings== French conductor Pierre Chagnon and an unidentified ensemble recorded the Trois petites pièces montées for the Columbia label in 1928, one of the earliest recordings of Satie's orchestral music.Viva-Tonal Columbia 50292-D [WLX336/WLX710]. Chagnon adopts brisk tempi throughout, presumably to accommodate the limits of a single 78 rpm side; the performance comes in at just under 4 minutes. Commercial releases in the stereo and digital eras are represented by Anthony Bernard with the London Chamber Orchestra (RCA Victor, 1959), Manuel Rosenthal with the French National Radio and Television Orchestra (Everest, 1968), Friedrich Cerha and the Ensemble \\"Die Reihe\\" (Candide, 1970), Gennady Rozhdestvensky with the Chamber Ensemble of the Leningrad Philharmonic (Melodia, 1976, reissued by ABC Westminster Gold and Eurodisc), and Yutaka Sado and the Orchestre Lamoureux (Erato, 2001). Piano 4 Hands: Aldo Ciccolini recorded it twice for EMI, overdubbing the second piano part himself in 1971 and paired with Gabriel Tacchino in 1988.

They are part of New Testament apocrypha, and provide accounts of the birth and early life of Jesus. The texts are of various and uncertain origin, and are generally non-canonical in major modern branches of Christianity. They include the Gospel of James, which introduces the concept of the Perpetual Virginity of Mary, and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas (not to be confused with the unrelated Gospel of Thomas), both of which cover many miraculous incidents from the life of Mary and the childhood of Jesus that are not included in the canonical gospels. Although the Life of John the Baptist focuses on John the Baptist rather than Jesus or his immediate family, it is also included in the genre as its events would be contemporary with Jesus's early life. == Gospel of James == The Gospel of James, also known as the Protoevangelium of James, and the Infancy Gospel of James, is a apocryphal gospel most likely written around the year AD 145, expanding the infancy stories contained in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke It also presents a narrative concerning the birth and upbringing of Mary herself. It is the oldest source to mention the virginity of Mary not only prior to, but during (and after) the birth of Jesus. The ancient manuscripts that preserve the book have different titles, including \\"The Birth of Mary\\", \\"The Story of the Birth of Saint Mary, Mother of God,\\" and \\"The Birth of Mary; The Revelation of James.\\" It is also referred to as \\"Genesis of Mary\\".Brent Nongbri, The Archaeology of Early Christian Manuscripts, Ancient Near East Today (ANET), American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), April 2019, Vol. VII, No. 4. Accessed 18 April 2019 == The Infancy Gospel of Thomas == The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a group of texts of uncertain date and contents, and the title is an arbitrary construction of modern scholars. Up until 1945 it was primarily referred to as the \\"Gospel of Thomas\\". See Ehrman & Plebe 2011:19. --> The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a biographical gospel about the childhood of Jesus, believed to date at the latest to the second century. It does not form part of any biblical canon. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is thought to be Gnostic in origin. Later references (by Hippolytus of Rome and Origen of Alexandria) to a \\"Gospel of Thomas\\" are not at all referring to this Infancy Gospel, as many modern scholars have thought, but rather to the wholly different Gospel of Thomas. Proto-orthodox Christians regarded the Infancy Gospel of Thomas as inauthentic and heretical. Eusebius rejected it as a heretical \\"fiction\\" in the third book of his fourth-century Church History, and Pope Gelasius I included it in his list of heretical books in the fifth century. Although non-canonical in mainstream Christianity, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas contains many miracles and stories of Jesus referenced in the Qur'an, such as Jesus giving life to clay birds. == Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew == The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is a part of the New Testament apocrypha, and was an important source for establishing details of the life of Mary, especially before the late Middle Ages.David R. Cartlidge, James Keith Elliott, Art and the Christian Apocrypha, p 32 (and pp. 21–46 generally), 2001, Routledge, London; According to the research of J. Gijsel / R. Beyers (1997) the archetype of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthews Recensio-α dates to 800 AD and the composition date to the first half of the seventh century, maybe to around 600 and 625 AD. Gijsel furthermore points out that Joachims representation in Pseudo-Matthews is meant to evoke the model figure of a Merowingian nobleman, this one, according to Gijsel, being Dagobert I during his reign (629639). According to Berthold, the composition date of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew was circa 650 AD at the earliest, due to the fact that it \\"shows literary dependence on Vita Agnetis of Pseudo-Ambrose\\", which itself was used in De Virginitate in 690 AD. According to G. Schneider, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthews was composed in the 8th or 9th century during the Carolingian dynasty. Pseudo-Matthew shares many similarities with, and likely used as sources, the apocryphal Gospel of James and Infancy Gospel of Thomas. ==History of Joseph the Carpenter== The History of Joseph the Carpenter (Historia Josephi Fabri Lignari) is a compilation of traditions concerning Mary, Joseph, and the \\"holy family,\\" probably composed in Byzantine Egypt in Greek in the late sixth or early seventh centuries, but surviving only in Coptic and Arabic language translations.Bart D. Ehrman, Zlatko Pleše The Apocryphal Gospels: Texts and Translations Oxford University Press, US 2011 p 158, quote \\"In its present form, the History of Joseph the Carpenter is thus a compilation of various traditions concerning Mary and the \\"holy family,\\" most likely composed in Byzantine Egypt in the late sixth or early seventh century.\\" The text bears witness to the belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary. It is one of the texts within the New Testament apocrypha concerned with the period of Jesus' life before he was 12. ==The Life of John the Baptist == The Life of John the Baptist is a book from the New Testament apocrypha, allegedly written in Greek by Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis in 390 AD.A. Mingana (Woodbrooke Studies: Christian Documents in Syriac, Arabic, and Garshuni, vol. 1, Cambridge 1927, pp. 138–287).Čéplö, Slavomir. “The Life of John the Baptist by Serapion.” Pages 262–92 in vol. 1 of New Testament Apocrypha: More Noncanonical Scriptures. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2016 (translation based on (Edgbaston, University of Birmingham, Mingana Syr. 369, fols. 142r–149v (1481).) and (Vatican, Biblioteca apostolica, Sbath 125, no foliation (1440)). The text is an expanded biography of the biblical John the Baptist. While it does not focus primarily on the life of Jesus, it is considered an infancy gospel due to its focus on events would have occurred around the same time as Jesus's childhood. ==References== * Category:Apocryphal Gospels ","title":"Infancy gospels"},{"id":"46393982","text":"Presidente Prudente may refer to the following : ; Prudente de Morais e Barros, third president of Brazil (1894 - 1898) ; places and jurisdictions : * Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazilian city named after the above, also a Latin Catholic episcopal see * Presidente Prudente Airport ","title":"Presidente Prudente"},{"id":"46394000","text":"is a name used for multiple mountains in Japan.

The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was scheduled to take over park operations in November 2014. The $15 million development of the new park is part of an overall initiative to revitalize Buffalo's outer harbor. The park officially opened to the public on May 24, 2015. Although first-year visitors praised the park's modern playground, some marina slipholders expressed displeasure with the marina's new operator, a private company from Tennessee. A second phase of park improvements, featuring $3.76 million in breakwall and revetment enhancements for the park's harbor, was announced in November 2015. Plans call for the installation of a paved walkway and bike path for accessing the breakwall, in addition to improved lighting and a new fishing platform. The improvements are scheduled to be completed by fall 2016. ==Park facilities== The park features a 1,000 slip marina, boat launches, a fish cleaning station, a nautical-themed playground, and picnic pavilions, and a restaurant. A beach is also available, however swimming is not permitted as of 2015.

Further elections for municipal mayors and assemblies took place on April 26. In addition to indicating support for the Abe government, the elections were also seen as a referendum on the Japan Innovation Party, and particularly on Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto's plan to restructure the Osaka prefectural government. In the first stage, average turnout was estimated at 47.14%, the lowest in the history of Japanese unified elections and the first time that average turnout in unified elections fell below 50%. The total number of prefectural and designated city assembly candidates was also the lowest in history at 3,272, 501 of which (21.9% of seats) ran unopposed. The Democratic Party of Japan fielded 345 candidates, 40% less than the number fielded in the 2011 local elections. Chiba Prefecture had the lowest overall turnout rate at 37%.

Bentley's place of birth is Massachusetts, names of parents, and high school are missing. She holds a nursing degree from the Church of Christ-affiliated Harding College in Searcy in White County, Arkansas. A former registered nurse at Arkansas Children's Hospital in the capital city of Little Rock, Bentley, with her ex- husband, has been, since 1983, the owner of Bentley Plastics in Perryville. She filed for divorce from her husband after filing an order of protection against him. He was arrested in January 2018 for violating the protection order. She was also accused of making veiled threats to a Game and Fish Officer after her husband was caught on video illegally baiting wildlife in the Ouachita National Forest near their home. She is a member of New Life Fellowship Church, a contemporary Southern Baptist rural congregation near Perryville. She and her ex-husband, Ted Alan Bentley (born c. 1956), have three children. She ran without opposition in the Republican primary held on May 20, 2014, for the District 73 nomination to the state House. In the November 4 general election, she unseated the two-term Democrat John Catlett by 196 votes, 3,588 (51.4 percent) to 3,392 (48.6 percent), in an election year highly favorable in Arkansas to her party. In the 2012 general election, Catlett had defeated Bentley to gain his second term in the office. Representative Bentley holds these committee assignments: (1) Public Health, Welfare, and Labor, (2) City, County, and Local Affairs, and (3) Legislative Joint Audit. In February 2015, Bentley joined dozens of her fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. That same month, Bentley supported House Bill 1228, sponsored by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Democratic Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson. In March 2017 she worked to eliminate The Department of Diversity and Inclusion at Arkansas Tech University which is located near her district. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Arkansas Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:People from Perry County, Arkansas Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:Baptists from Arkansas Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Mary Bentley (Arkansas politician)"},{"id":"46394343","text":"The Prodigal Wife is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: The Prodigal Wife 1918 American silent drama film directed by Frank Reicher and starring Mary Boland.

Years later, driven to extreme poverty, the mother determines to seek her husband out to obtain some relief. The doctor is now well-to-do and Marna (Cotton) has grown to womanhood. Marion goes to the doctor's home and does not find him there, but discovers her daughter in the flesh before her. Adroitly she finds out that Marna worships her \\"dead\\" mother, and Marion leaves, determined to sin no more. Marna marries a writer, Dallas Harvey (Gordon), and Marion becomes the family nursemaid after Marna has a child. When temptation comes to Marna the same way it did to Marion years earlier, Marion divulges her story and saves her daughter from sin.

The family was originally landed with title over Soutomaior, Province of Pontevedra, Galicia founded by Mendo Páez de Sorred, the Ricohombre of King Alfonso VII of Leon and Castile. García Méndez was one of the sons of Alfonso García de Sotomayor, III Señor de Sotomayor and his wife Urraca Pires Barroso though it appears that García Méndez did not inherit his father's title over Sotomayor. His paternal grandfather was Garcí Méndez I de Sotomayor, Conquistador de Córdoba. == Biography == In the mid 1200s, Ferdinand III of Castile was involved in a series of Reconquista campaigns against the Caliphate of Córdoba and other minor Christian and Moorish territories in the area around El Carpio, Andalucía, Province of Córdoba as a part of his campaign for Alcocer (Al-Qusayr). After victory in this campaign in 1240, Ferdinand III divvied the land up between the Castilian crown and the nobles who took part in the campaign as Señorios and other titles tied to the Castilian crown. Heavily involved in the fighting, the House of Sotomayor was awarded much of the land principally in the area around El Carpio. By 1325, the Sotomayor lands, passed down by various family members, were collected and amassed by García Méndez de Sotomayor who was responsible for the founding of the Señorio del Castillo de Carpio. The foundation of the Señorio is generally placed at 1325, the year that the tower at El Carpio was completed. The tower and its surrounding fortifications would serve as the center of administration for the Señorio and the Marquesado of Carpio until the title became associated with the Dukes of Alba. == Marriage and descendants == García Méndez married Juana Rodríguez de Jodar and the couple had 5 children: * Garci Méndez de Sotomayor, II Señor del Castillo de Carpio (b. 1310) - who went on to become the II Señor del Castillo de Carpio. * Alfonso García de Sotomayor - birthdate unknown, possibly older than brother Garci Méndez * Sancho García de Sotomayor * Ruy Méndez de Sotomayor * María Méndez de Sotomayor == See also == * Señorio del Castillo de Carpio == References == Category:1280 births Category:Year of death missing Garcia Mendez de Sotomayor Category:Grandees of Spain Category:Señors of Castillo de Carpio Category:Medieval Spanish nobility Category:14th-century Castilians ","title":"Garcí Méndez II de Sotomayor"},{"id":"46394398","text":"Isopropylphenidate (also known as IPH and IPPD) is a piperidine based stimulant drug, closely related to methylphenidate, but with the methyl ester replaced by an isopropyl ester.

A critic related that both played violins and both danced—Herman to a Russian step and Hattie to a waltz.

The Broadway production apparently never came to pass, probably due in part to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Timberg reportedly had saved a great deal of money from stage appearances that was lost in the Crash. His subsequent career was marked by the continuation of his varied activities orbiting around performing (now usually with comic foils), writing, and occasionally producing. An exception to his stage activities was film. In 1931 he wrote and appeared in the MGM short Ambitious People. In an interview that same year he was quoted saying of a new playwright: \\"He knows nothing about dialogue or building up a situation. He doesn't know upstage from downstage or a border light from a fly gallery. But he knows all the dirty stories in the world.\\"\\"New Blood in the Theatre,\\" unidentified newspaper dated Sept. 22, 1931 in the \\"Herman Timberg\\" clipping file in the Billy Rose Theatre Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

Jr.Unidentified clipping dated Feb. 26, 1933 in the \\"Herman Timberg\\" clipping file in the Billy Rose Theatre Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Later that year, \\"the diminutive dance comedian\\" (the description given to Timberg by the New York Sun) presented a new version of his skit \\"The Laugh Factory\\" at the Metropolitan Theatre and was again assisted by his son Herman Timberg Jr., along with Audrey Parker, Leo Chalzel and Oliver Harris.\\"Timberg Will Head Show at Metropolitan,\\" New York Sun (Jul. 5, 1933). His June 1934 appearance at the Palace Theatre in a 53-minute act called Temptations occasioned a number of reviews. The New York Herald Tribune said that Timberg \\"offers in rapid succession all of the comedian's tested variety routines.\\"G.P., \\"Herman Timberg's Show on Palace Theatre Stage,\\" New York Herald Tribune (Jun. 16, 1934). But Variety was more critical: \\"At 53 minutes, [it] moves too slowly, though some moments go fast.\\" The review suggested \\"there's too much talking and too many repetitions of the same effect, such as engaging in dialogue with more than 2 chorines.\\" The reviewer complimented his partner, Audrey Parker, but concluded that Timberg \\"has a show with plenty of comedy and flash, but it needs to be broken up more with specialties.\\"Chic., \\"Timberg 'Temptations',\\" Variety (Jun. 19, 1934).

In 1936 it was reported that he had been engaged by Jack Curtis and Carlteton Hoagland to adapt the London musical Yes, Madam for Broadway.\\"Book by Timberg,\\" New York Daily News (Jul. 3, 1936).

Neither of these efforts appear to have come to fruition. In 1949, Timberg, \\"who's been on the boards for more years than he may care to admit,\\" was appearing with the youthful Graham Sisters. As if recalling his earlier acts, Variety reported that \\"Timberg hasn't lost his skill at dancing or comedies and fiddling.\\"\\"Palace, N.Y.,\\" Variety (Dec. 28, 1949). One of his last appearances was at the Palace Theatre where, \\"nearly blind, he did an energetic turn with a femme foil which called for extremely fast movement and trick violin playing.

At the twilight of his life Timberg was living at the Greystone Hotel at 212 West 91st Street (on Broadway) in Manhattan, New York. Timberg died on April 16, 1952 at Memorial Hospital in New York City \\"after a long illness.\\" == Family == Timberg married Hazel Rosenbloom on Nov. 26, 1913. Under her stage name, Hazel Rosewood, she was a dancer in shows such as those produced by Gus Edwards as well as in the Ziegfeld Follies.

He was the son of David Pringle and his wife Mary Hilston. He learned golf by starting out as a caddie. Pringle was described as having an admirable swing, one that was technically correct and aesthetically pleasing to see. He was said to be a great stylist of the day, in the manner of Harry Vardon. In October 1874, Pringle stunned a strong field in a four-round tournament on the Musselburgh Links.

In his late teens, Piasecki fought in the Battle of Lemberg (1918), and the Polish-Ukrainian War. He also fought in the Polish-Soviet War of 1920–21 as a volunteer. In the 1920s, he studied architecture at University of Jan Kazimierz in Lwow, and law at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. He also was a member of the right-wing student organization Academic Union All-Polish Youth. In 1935, Piasecki founded his own literary weekly magazine, Prosto z mostu, which presented Polish right-wing publicists and writers.

In December 1939, first issue of underground magazine Walka (Struggle) was released, with Piasecki as its editor in chief. The office of the magazine was located at Piasecki's apartment, and the money for the publication came from Arkadia Restaurant, owned by him.

Note the image under g of the standard basis generates M. In particular, if J is finite, then M is a finitely generated module. If I and J are finite sets, then the presentation is called a finite presentation; a module is called finitely presented if it admits a finite presentation. Since f is a module homomorphism between free modules, it can be visualized as an (infinite) matrix with entries in R and M as its cokernel. A free presentation always exists: any module is a quotient of a free module: F \\\\overset{g}\\\\to M \\\\to 0, but then the kernel of g is again a quotient of a free module: F' \\\\overset{f} \\\\to \\\\ker g \\\\to 0. The combination of f and g is a free presentation of M. Now, one can obviously keep \\"resolving\\" the kernels in this fashion; the result is called a free resolution. Thus, a free presentation is the early part of the free resolution. A presentation is useful for computation. For example, since tensoring is right-exact, tensoring the above presentation with a module, say N, gives: : \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} N \\\\overset{f \\\\otimes 1} \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{j \\\\in J} N \\\\to M \\\\otimes_R N \\\\to 0. This says that M \\\\otimes_R N is the cokernel of f \\\\otimes 1. If N is an R-algebra, then this is the presentation of the N-module M \\\\otimes_R N; that is, the presentation extends under base extension.

Jamie Anderson won the Championship for the second successive year, by two strokes from runner-up Bob Kirk. Cosgrove had rounds of 55-56-55=166 and finished in a tie for sixth place with Willie Park, Sr. Details of play Davie Strath and Bob Ferguson played together but Strath had a disappointing 45 in the first round which left him well behind the leaders. Ferguson began in disappointing fashion but managed to salvage a 40. William Brown led on 39 with Ferguson and Jamie Anderson on 40. After two rounds, three players were level on 80: Brown, Ferguson and Cosgrove with Anderson and Bob Pringle only two behind. Strath was five behind on 85. Anderson carded a 37 in the third round while Ferguson could muster only a 40 and Davie Strath scored 38. Anderson now led on 119 with Ferguson on 120, Ferguson on 122 and Strath on 123. In the final round Strath took a horrendous 9 at the second to drop out of contention. Ferguson also had a disappointing last round and Anderson's 41 was enough to give him the Championship. ==Results in The Open Championship== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 !1878 !1879 !1880 !1881 !1882 !1883 !1884 !1885 !1886 !1887 !1888 !1889 - align=leftThe Open Championship T20 DNP DNP style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T3 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T6 DNP DNP DNP DNP 16 T16 T29 T20 DNP DNP T15 } Note: Cosgrove played only in The Open Championship.

A top fifteen player in both singles and doubles, she reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 12 on 26 November 2018 and a career- high of world No. 2 in doubles on 9 September 2019. Mertens has won five singles and nine doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including one Grand Slam at the 2019 US Open with Aryna Sabalenka, as well as eleven singles and thirteen doubles titles on the ITF Circuit. While her most prolific success has come in the form of doubles, including winning both the Indian Wells and Miami doubles titles in 2019 to complete the Sunshine Double, Mertens has also been very successful in singles, including reaching the semifinals at the 2018 Australian Open and the quarterfinals of both the 2019 and 2020 US Open. ==Personal life== Mertens was born in Leuven, the second daughter of Liliane Barbe, a teacher, and Guido Mertens, who makes furniture for churches. She was home-schooled and enjoyed studying languages, having learned to speak French, English and Dutch/Flemish. Her older sister, Lauren, is currently an airline pilot and introduced the then 4-year-old Elise to tennis. While growing up, Mertens looked up to Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters, and is currently a member of the Kim Clijsters Academy, where she has been training since 2015. She is not related to Belgium’s international footballer Dries Mertens or fellow tennis player Yannick Mertens. ==Tennis career== Early and junior years Mertens was a doubles finalist at the 2014 QNet Open, alongside Marina Melnikova. Mertens made her WTA main-draw debut at the 2015 Copa Colsanitas in the doubles event, partnering Nastja Kolar. She won her first WTA doubles title at the 2016 ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, partnering An-Sophie Mestach. 2017: First WTA singles title and top 40 debut In January, Mertens won the Hobart International, beating No. 3 seed Monica Niculescu in the final. As a result of this she broke into the WTA top 100 for the first time, on 16 January 2017.

After that, she failed to qualify to both Indian Wells and Miami Open, losing in the first round of qualifying to Sachia Vickery and Alison Van Uytvanck, respectively. At the Ladies Open Biel Bienne, Mertens upset No. 8 seed Monica Niculescu and beat Mona Barthel en route to the quarterfinals, losing there to eventual finalist Anett Kontaveit. 2018: First Grand Slam semifinal, three titles, Masters double qualification Mertens began the season by becoming the first woman to win back-to-back titles in Hobart. She defeated Mihaela Buzărnescu in the final, defending her title from 2017. Along with Demi Schuurs, she also won the doubles title. Mertens' season continued with her main-draw debut at the Australian Open. She defeated qualifier Viktória Kužmová, 23rd seed Daria Gavrilova, Alizé Cornet and Petra Martić, all in straight sets, to advance to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. In the quarterfinal, Mertens achieved her first victory over a top five ranked player, defeating Elina Svitolina, again in straight sets. With her win over Svitolina, Mertens became the third Belgian woman to reach the last four at the tournament, joining former ranking leaders Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters. In the semifinals she lost to Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets. After her good form in Australia, Mertens had some difficult weeks. She lost respectively in the first round of Doha, Dubai and Indian Wells and in the second round in Miami. In April, she reached her fourth singles final and second of the year at the Ladies Open Lugano in Switzerland. She won the title by beating Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets. Together with compatriot Kirsten Flipkens, she also won the doubles title. Two weeks later, she also won the singles title at the Morocco Open by defeating Australian Ajla Tomljanovic in straight sets. Mertens lost in the second round at Madrid to top seed Simona Halep. She reached the fourth round at the French Open, defeating Varvara Lepchenko, Heather Watson, and Daria Gavrilova before falling again to Halep, who went on to win the title. Seeded second at 's Hertogenbosch, she lost in the second round to Antonia Lottner. Mertens started off the grass-court season with first-round loss to qualifier Dalila Jakupović in Birmingham. In Eastbourne she lost in third round to Aryna Sabalenka. At Wimbledon, Mertens lost in third round to Dominika Cibulková. In the American swing, Mertens reached the semifinals in San Jose as well as quarterfinals in Montreal and Cincinnati.

Then in Sydney, she got her first two wins of the season by defeating Katerina Siniaková and Anett Kontaveit before losing in the quarterfinals to Ashleigh Barty. Defending semifinalist points from last year, she entered the Australian Open as the 12th seed. She won her first and second match in straight sets before falling to 17th seed Madison Keys in the third round. Due to her early exit, her ranking fell to no. 21. Mertens played Fed Cup in her homecountry for the first time. She was unable to win her two matches against Frenchwomen Alizé Cornet and Caroline Garcia. In the week after, she moved to Doha to play the Qatar Open. She began unseeded at this tournament, but she surprisingly won her first Premier title. On her route to the tournament win, she took the scalp of three top-10 players, including Kiki Bertens, Angelique Kerber and world No. 2 Simona Halep. After her biggest career win to date, she came back in the top 20 at No. 16. Just two days later, Mertens played in Dubai, where she was placed as 16th seed. She lost in her opening-match against qualifier Zhu Lin after a battle of near three hours. In March, Mertens started her American tour at Indian Wells. She was 16th seeded but lost in the third round in another battle near three hours against Chinese 18th seed Wang Qiang. Even though she lost early in singles, she was able to win her biggest doubles title to date, alongside Aryna Sabalenka at Indian Wells. Defeating first seeds Barbora Krejčíková and Kateřina Siniaková in the final. Two weeks later, the pair was also able to win the Miami Open doubles title, completing the Sunshine Double. Mertens and Sabalenka became just the fifth doubles pairing in history, and first since Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza in 2015, to complete the Sunshine Double in doubles. These titles took Mertens inside the top 10 in doubles for the first time. Mertens had a rough start to the clay court season, losing in the opening round of four of her first five tournaments (the exception being a quarterfinal appearance in Morocco where she was upset by the eventual tournament champion Maria Sakkari). Seeded 20th at the French Open, Mertens beat Tamara Zidanšek and Diane Parry to advance to the third round, where she was beaten by 12th seed Anastasija Sevastova in a three hour 18-minute match three-set match, despite winning the first set and holding five match points in the decider. Mertens and Sabalenka performed well in the doubles draw, where they were seeded sixth. The pair reached the semifinals, where they were defeated by the No. 2 seeds and eventual champions Tímea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic. Mertens performed much stronger in the grass-court season warmup events, making the quarterfinals in Mallorca and the third round in Eastbourne (in both tournaments she lost to the eventual champions, Sofia Kenin and Karolína Plíšková respectively). Seeded 21st at Wimbledon, Mertens advanced to the fourth round for the first time, taking out Fiona Ferro, Monica Niculescu and 15th seed Wang Qiang. However, she was upset by world no. 54 Barbora Strýcová after having a one-set lead. In doubles, Mertens and Sabalenka advanced to the quarterfinals, but were defeated by eventual champions Strýcová and Hsieh Su-wei, the second consecutive Grand Slam the pair lost to the team that would go on to win the tournament. In the early summer hard- court season, Mertens struggled to replicate her 2018 success, losing her opening round match in San Jose to Kristie Ahn and falling in the second round of Toronto and Cincinnati to Serena Williams and Elina Svitolina, respectively. At the US Open, in September, Mertens was seeded 25th in singles. She defeated Jil Teichmann, Kristýna Plíšková, and former world no. 9 Andrea Petkovic in straight sets, before taking revenge on wildcard Kristie Ahn to reach her second Grand Slam singles quarterfinal, becoming the first Belgian woman to reach the last eight since Kim Clijsters won the title in 2010. She once again squandered a one-set lead, going down in three sets to world no. 15 and the eventual champion Bianca Andreescu. Playing doubles with Sabalenka, the pair reached the final with ease, dropping just one set along the way. The pair then defeated Victoria Azarenka and Ashleigh Barty in the final, winning their first Grand Slam doubles title both as a team and individually. Mertens became the first Belgian to reach a US Open final, as well as winning one, in doubles, and the first Belgian woman to win a Grand Slam doubles title since Clijsters won Wimbledon in 2003. Following the tournament, she reached a new career-high doubles ranking of number 2 in the world. Mertens failed to register much success in singles during the Asian hard-court swing, outside of a semifinal appearance at the Pan Pacific Open, but reached her fourth doubles final of the year with Sabalenka at the Premier 5-level Wuhan Open, where the pair lost to Duan Yingying and Veronika Kudermetova. Mertens' consistency in both disciplines qualified her to compete in both year-end tournaments. She first competed at the WTA Elite Trophy in singles, where she qualified for the second straight year. Drawn in the same group as her doubles partner Sabalenka, she was beaten in three close sets by the Belarusian before defeating Sakkari in three sets. Placing second in her round-robin group, she failed to advance to her semifinals (Sabalenka won the title). She next competed at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, playing doubles. The pair fell to Babos and Mladenovic in three sets before recording a straight sets win over the Taiwanese sisters Chan Hao-ching and Latisha Chan. Needing a win over Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Demi Schuurs to advance to the semifinals, they were beaten in three close sets, ending their tournament and season. She finished the year ranked no. 17 in singles and no. 6 in the world in doubles. 2020: Prague final, Cincinnati semifinals, US Open quarterfinal Mertens opened the year by reaching the quarterfinals in both Shenzhen, where she was beaten to Elena Rybakina, and Hobart, losing to Heather Watson. Seeded 16th at the Australian Open, Mertens eased through to the fourth round with straight set wins over Danka Kovinić, Watson and Catherine Bellis before being defeated by Simona Halep. In doubles, Mertens and Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals where they lost to Chan Hao-ching and Latisha Chan. After losing early in both Dubai and Doha, Mertens was next scheduled to play in Indian Wells, but the tournament was cancelled and the tour suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the tour resumed in August, Mertens lost her opening match in Palermo, but bounced back by reaching her first final of the year at the Prague Open. She then lost to Halep for the second time that year. At the Western & Southern Open, Mertens advanced to her first ever Premier 5 semifinal, where she was beaten by Naomi Osaka in straight sets. Seeded 16th at the 2020 US Open, Mertens opened her campaign by beating Laura Siegemund in straight sets, followed by two-set wins over Sara Sorribes Tormo and 18-year old Caty McNally. She then caused a huge upset by defeating the second seed and reigning Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin 6-3 6-3, making it to the quarter-finals of the US Open for the second consecutive year. However, she was thrashed in the quarters by former World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, winning just one game. Mertens and Sabalenka also played doubles together, where they were the defending champions. However, they were beaten in the quarterfinals by the eventual champions Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva. ==Playing style== Mertens is a baseline player. She has consistent groundstrokes on both her forehand and backhand. Her backhand is her more reliable wing, while she can struggle with the timing on her forehand at times. She is quick moving laterally and she has precise timing on her groundstrokes which allows her to take the ball on the rise as well as redirect it. Her serve is reliable but not too forceful. When she is playing well she is able to hit many winners from the baseline. ==Career statistics== Grand Slam tournament performance timelines Singles {class= style=text-align:center - !Tournament!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018!!2019!!2020!!SR!!W–L!!Win% - left\\" Australian Open A Q2 A style=\\"background:yellow;SF afeeee;\\"3R afeeee;\\"4R 0 / 3 7–3  - left\\" French Open A Q3 afeeee;\\"3R afeeee;\\"4R afeeee;\\"3R afeeee;\\"3R 0 / 4 9–4  - left\\" Wimbledon Q3 Q2 afeeee;\\"1R afeeee;\\"3R afeeee;\\"4R style=\\"color:#ccc;\\"NH 0 / 3 5–3  - left\\" US Open Q1 afeeee;\\"1R afeeee;\\"1R afeeee;\\"4R ffebcd;\\"QF ffebcd;\\"QF 0 / 5 11–5  -efefef; font-weight:bold;\\"  left;\\" Win–loss 0–0 0–1 2–3 13–4 11–4 9–3 0 / 15 35–15  } Doubles {class= style=text- align:center - !Tournament!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018!!2019!!2020!!SR!!W–L!!Win% - left\\" Australian Open A A afeeee;\\"2R afeeee;\\"1R afeeee;\\"3R ffebcd;\\"QF 0 / 4 6–4  - left\\" French Open A A afeeee;\\"1R afeeee;\\"1R style=\\"Background:yellow;”SF afeeee;\\"2R 0 / 4 5–4  - left\\" Wimbledon A afeeee;\\"2R afeeee;\\"3R afeeee;\\"3R ffebcd;\\"QF style=\\"color:#ccc;\\"NH 0 / 4 8–4  - left\\" US Open A A afeeee;\\"2R ffebcd;\\"QF style=\\"background:lime;\\"W ffebcd;\\"QF 1 / 4 12–3  -efefef; font-weight:bold;\\"  left;\\" Win–loss 0–0 1–1 4–4 5–4 15–3 6–3 1 / 16 31–15  } Grand Slam tournament finals Doubles: 1 (1 title) { class=\\"sortable \\" !Result !Year !Tournament !Surface !Partner !Opponents !class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\" 98fb98\\"Win 2019 US Open Hard  Aryna Sabalenka  Victoria Azarenka Ashleigh Barty 7–5, 7–5 } ==References* Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian female tennis players Category:Sportspeople from Leuven Category:Hopman Cup competitors Category:US Open (tennis) champions Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's doubles ","title":"Elise Mertens"},{"id":"46394942","text":"Raquel Pa'aluhi Canuto (born October 14, 1990) is an American Brazilian jiu- jitsu grappler and former mixed martial artist.

Allan was a runner-up in the 1879 Open Championship. ==Early life== Allan was born in Prestwick, Scotland on 28 August 1861, the son of Hugh and Mary Allan. Two of his older brothers, John (c. 1847–1897) and Matthew (1858–1890) were also professional golfers. ==Golf career== Allan served as a professional at Royal North Devon Golf Club in Westward Ho!, Devon, England. He possessed a knack for lofting his golf ball, a skill that he demonstrated on occasion to the Royal North Devon members. It is unclear what the trick entailed. It is surmised that he was able to hit a shot much higher than was thought possible with the pitching clubs in use at the time. By the time Allan played in his first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1878, he had already joined his brother John in Devon. Allan had a poor first round of 62, leaving him 12 behind the leader. Further rounds of 53 and 52 left him in eighth place, 10 strokes behind Jamie Anderson. In August 1879, Allan played a series of four matches against Bob Kirk for stakes totalling £200. The matches were played at Royal North Devon Golf Club, Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Prestwick Golf Club and on the Old Course at St Andrews. £25 was at stake for each match with a further £100 for the overall winner. The first match was played on 13 August at North Devon. Allan was four holes up after the morning round and won by seven holes after the second round. At Royal Liverpool, the match started even with the pair level after nine holes. However Allan led by four holes at the end of the round and eventually won by 14 holes. At Prestwick, Allan won by six holes, increasing his overall lead to 27. The final match was played at St Andrews on 28 August. Allan won five of the first six holes to win the overall match 32 & 30\\\\. Allan led by nine holes after the first round and Kirk conceded the match. In the afternoon, Allan played a match against James Morris, winning 6 & 5. The 1879 Open Championship was the 19th Open Championship, held 27 September at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Allan shot rounds of 88 and 84 for a total of 172. Jamie Anderson won the Championship for the third successive time, by three strokes from Allan and Andrew Kirkaldy. Allan and Kirkaldy had an 18-hole play-off two days later to decide who took the second and third place prize money. Kirkaldy scored 91 to Allan's 92 and took the second prize of £6, Allan taking the third prize of £5. After the championship, Allan played another series of four matches, similar to those he had played against Bob Kirk in August, but this time against the new champion, Jamie Anderson. As in the previous match, stakes totalled £200. The matches were played on the Old Course at St Andrews, Prestwick Golf Club, Royal Liverpool Golf Club and finally at Royal North Devon Golf Club. Anderson won three of the matches with Allan winning at Royal Liverpool. Allan was defeated in the overall match by 8 & 7. The first match was played on 30 September at St Andrews the day after the championship playoff. Anderson was five up after the morning round and eventually won by two holes. In the second match at Prestwick Allan was one up after the first 12-hole round. He increased his lead to four holes after 8 holes of the second round but lost the last 4 holes to leave the match level. Anderson won the first round by three holes to win the match. In the third match at Hoylake Anderson led by three after the first round but Allen came back and won the match by a single hole. At Westward Ho! on 24 October, Anderson led by three holes after the first round. He won the overall matches 8 & 7 after 11 holes of the second round and, later, the individual match by 5 & 3\\\\. Allan left Royal North Devon in the mid-1880s returning to Scotland. ==Death== Allan died on 8 August 1900 in Wimbledon, Surrey after a long illness. ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1878 !1879 !1880 !1881 !1882 !1883 !1884 !1885 !1886 !1887 !1888 !1889 - The Open Championship style=\\"background:yellow;\\"8 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T2 eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" T29 T33 eeeeee;\\" T18 ? } Note: Allan only played in The Open Championship. ? = played, finish unknown \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:1861 births Category:1900 deaths ","title":"Jamie Allan"},{"id":"46395026","text":"Louisa Elizabeth Miller, better known as Lulu Miller, is an American writer, artist, and science reporter for National Public Radio. Miller's career in radio started as a producer for the WNYC program Radiolab. She helped create the NPR show Invisibilia with Alix Spiegel. ==Biography== Miller attended Swarthmore College where she received the Beik Prize for The Troubles By Our Women: The Urban Male Perspective on Independent Women in Independent Nigeria in 2005. She went on to graduate with a degree in history. After college, she moved to Brooklyn, New York where an interest in sculpture led her to answer a craigslist ad from a woodworker who was seeking an assistant. She spent her hours at the wood shop listening to the radio, and toward the end of her year working there, she heard Radiolab, which was then a local show on WNYC. She fell in love with the show and wrote them a letter, asking if she could volunteer. She started as an intern, going in one day a week to answer emails and burn CDs, and eventually became the show's first hired audio producer. After five years at Radiolab, Miller left to pursue her passion as a writer via a fellowship position at the University of Virginia where she taught and wrote fiction. Before moving to Virginia, she spent a summer cycling across the United States, a trip that she documented and featured parts of on Radiolab. After her two years at UVA, Miller returned to radio as a freelance journalist for NPR's Science Desk. On a trip to the Third Coast International Audio Festival in Chicago, she met former This American Life producer Alix Spiegel who asked Miller to produce a piece she was working on. The two began working on radio stories together and began to conceive a new long-form radio show that would become Invisibilia. Launched in January 2015, the show focuses on \\"the unseen forces that control human behavior.\\" Excerpts of Invisibilia were featured on All Things Considered, Morning Edition, Radiolab and This American Life helping it to debut at #1 on the iTunes podcast chart and hold a consistent top-ten ranking in the months following its launch. In 2020, she published Why Fish Don't Exist, a personal memoir incorporating the life and work of David Starr Jordan. ==Personal life== Miller openly admits to being an ophidiophobe.

Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.

The group held a showcase at Noon Square in Myeongdong on April 12, during which they revealed \\"Ah Yeah\\" and performed the song for the public for the first time.

In fact the former is a special case of the latter. As a Banach space they are the continuous dual of the Banach spaces \\\\ell_1 of absolutely summable sequences, and L^1 = L^1(X,\\\\Sigma, \\\\mu) of absolutely integrable measurable functions (if the measure space fulfills the conditions of being localizable and therefore semifinite).https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2800760/why-every- localizable-measure-space-is-semifinite-measure-space Pointwise multiplication gives them the structure of a Banach algebra, and in fact they are the standard examples of abelian Von Neumann algebras. == Sequence space == The vector space \\\\ell^\\\\infty is a sequence space whose elements are the bounded sequences. The vector space operations, addition and scalar multiplication, are applied coordinate by coordinate. With respect to the norm \\\\x\\\\_\\\\infty = \\\\sup_n x_n, \\\\ell^\\\\infty is a standard example of a Banach space. In fact, \\\\ell^\\\\infty can be considered as the \\\\ell^p space with the largest p. Moreover, every x \\\\in \\\\ell^\\\\infty defines a continuous functional on the space \\\\ell^1 of absolutely summable sequences by component-wise multiplication and summing: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\ell^\\\\infty &\\\\to {\\\\ell^1}^{\\\\vee}\\\\\\\\\\\\ x &\\\\mapsto (y \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{i = 1}^\\\\infty x_iy_i) \\\\end{align} . By evaluating on (0,\\\\ldots,0,1,0,\\\\ldots) we see that every continuous linear functional on \\\\ell^1 arises in this way. i.e. : {\\\\ell^1}^\\\\vee = \\\\ell^\\\\infty. Not every continuous linear functional on \\\\ell^\\\\infty arises from an absolutely summable series however: \\\\ell^1, and hence \\\\ell^\\\\infty is not a reflexive Banach space. == Function space == L∞ is a function space. Its elements are the essentially bounded measurable functions. More precisely, L∞ is defined based on an underlying measure space, . Start with the set of all measurable functions from to which are essentially bounded, i.e. bounded up to a set of measure zero. Two such functions are identified if they are equal almost everywhere. Denote the resulting set by . For a function in this set, its essential supremum serves as an appropriate norm: :\\\\f\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\equiv \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ C\\\\ge 0 : f(x) \\\\le C \\\\text{ for almost every } x \\\\\\\\}. See Lp space for more details. The sequence space is a special case of the function space: \\\\ell_\\\\infty = L_\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{N}) where the natural numbers are equipped with the counting measure. == Applications == One application of ℓ∞ and L∞ is in economies with infinitely many commodities. In simple economic models, it is common to assume that there is only a finite number of different commodities, e.g. houses, fruits, cars, etc., so every bundle can be represented by a finite vector, and the consumption set is a vector space with a finite dimension. But in reality, the number of different commodities may be infinite. For example, a \\"house\\" is not a single commodity type since the value of a house depends on its location. So the number of different commodities is the number of different locations, which may be considered infinite. In this case, the consumption set is naturally represented by L∞. == References == Category:Normed spaces Category:Banach spaces Category:Function spaces ","title":"L-infinity"},{"id":"46395429","text":"Cayesh is a mountain in the Cordillera Blanca in the Andes of Peru, about high.

Nick also speaks on and moderates industry panels at SXSW, CMJ, Soho House and USC, is regularly featured as an industry insider on Revolt LIVE and serves on the SXSW Advisory Board as well as the Rap Grammy Committee. His passion for film and cultural anthropology have led him into the documentary world directing a documentary for Sony Music-based singer Nneka. Nick is currently in production of several feature documentaries slated for 2016 releases. Hard Knock TV Nick Huff is well known for founding Hard Knock TV in 2005. After recognizing a need for in-depth coverage of hip hop and rap music and culture, he began conducting and posting his exclusive interviews onto what was the first entirely Hip Hop-based YouTube channel. Myspace While doing interviews for Hard Knock TV, Nick began working with Myspace during the height of its popularity (2007–2010), where he directed video segments featuring artists Lady Gaga, Diddy, Pitbull, and Lil Wayne, as well as highlighting companies such as Honda, Adidas, and Coca-Cola. Grammys In 2013, Nick became an official blogger for GRAMMY.com, and conducted interviews with artists including Pharrell, Andre 3000, Chuck D, Common, Wiz Khalifa, and YG. SXSW talks and panels Some of the SWSW panels and/or interviews Nick Huff Barili has participated in or led include the following: *Inside the Hit: Behind the Mind of a Producer *Wyclef Jean Interview *50 Cent Key Note *Bloggers the New Curators Panel ==Hard Knock Hoops== In 2011, Nick Huff established Hard Knock Hoops, an annual celebrity basketball tournament. The participants include both artists and industry influencers, and the tournament has seen the likes of Chris Brown, The Game, Taco (Odd Future), Quincy, Steelo Brim, Pac Div, Thurz, DJ Khalil, Ben Lyons, Dizzy Wright, K Camp, Goldlink, Trinidad James, Roscoe Dash and other industry influencers. Though the tournament creates a strong competitive atmosphere, the ultimate goal of Hard Knock Hoops is to build relationships among peers as well as the community. Participants in Hard Knock Hoops 2014 were able to engage with members of the LA community as tons of kids gathered around to watch the tournament and were able to interact with the players. Alignment with our event enables brands to have increased visibility for their featured products amongst artists, industry insiders, lifestyle influencers and their fan-bases. ==See also== *Hard Knock TV ==References== Category:American music journalists Category:Living people Category:1979 births ","title":"Nick Huff Barili"},{"id":"46395472","text":"Parametricism is a style within contemporary avant-garde architecture, promoted as a successor to Modern and Postmodern architecture. The term was coined in 2008 by Patrik Schumacher, an architectural partner of Zaha Hadid (1950–2016). Parametricism has its origin in parametric design, which is based on the constraints in a parametric equation. Parametricism relies on programs, algorithms, and computers to manipulate equations for design purposes. Aspects of parametricism have been used in urban design, architectural design, interior design and furniture design. Proponents of parametricism have declared that one of the defining features is that \\"Parametricism implies that all elements of the design become parametrically variable and mutually adaptive.\\" According to Schumacher, parametricism is an autopoiesis, or a self-referential system, in which all the elements are interlinked and an outside influence that changes one alters all the others.\\" Parametricism rejects both homogenization (serial repetition) and pure difference (agglomeration of unrelated elements) in favor of differentiation and correlation as key compositional values. The aim is to build up more spatial complexity while maintaining legibility, i.e. to intensify relations between spaces (or elements of a composition) and to adapt to contexts in ways that establish legible connections. This allows architecture to translate the complexity of contemporary life processes in the global Post-Fordist network society. ==History== Parametricism emerged as a theory-driven avant-garde design movement in the early 1990s, with its earliest practitioners – Greg Lynn, Jesse Reiser, Lars Spuybroek, Kas Oosterhuis among many others – harnessing and adapting the then new digital animation software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture much earlier by pioneers like John Frazer and Paul Coates, but that only spread to make an impact within avant-garde architecture in the last 10–15 years.Lynn, Greg. \\"CCA - Archeology of the Digital.\\" Schumaker has said that he believes the work of Frei Otto (1925 - 2015) is a precursor of Parametricism, as Frei \\"used physical processes as simulations and design engines to 'find' form rather than to draw conventional or invented forms. The inherent lawfulness of the engaged physical processes produced a combination of complexity, rigor and elegance that was otherwise unattainable. The power and beauty of this approach was striking.\\"Schumacher, Patrik. \\"11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style.\\" p.619 Early instances of proto-Parametricism, as manifest through the prolific generation of innovative designs and radical experiments within the transitional styles of Deconstructivism and Folding - including the work of the discipline’s discourse leaders such as Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Wolf D. Prix, Bernard Tschumi, and Daniel LibeskindJohnson, Phillip. \\"Deconstructivist Architecture - Museum of Modern Art - Fact Sheet.\\" \\\\- were later radicalized by younger practitioners who matured in the context of these early practices, and stabilized the discipline around prolonged research programmes thriving on emerging digital technologies, and culminating in the emergence of Parametricism. Parametricism co-evolved with the global shift from the Modernist era of Fordism (mass production) to the Post-Fordist era (mass customization) of contemporary global society, and continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global societal communication systems. Parametricism offers advantages over styles that cannot (because they were never intended to) resonate and respond to the complexity and rapid fluidity of today’s society. Despite the persistence of styles such as modernism, minimalism, postmodernism, historicism and deconstructivism, a hard core of continuous innovation in research and building has stabilized around the new heuristics of Parametricism, and is continuing to proliferate the new style in academic and practice domains worldwide. == Heuristics == Parametricism offers functional and formal heuristics based on set of general abstract rules distilled from a very complex ecosystem of sustained avant-garde design research that spans over twenty five years of continuous innovative communication. Parametricism achieves elegance in both senses of the word – it is unified (compact) and beautiful (vital). Functional heuristics The functional heuristics of Parametricism include both Negative Principles and Positive Principles that have evolved since the mid-1990s across many projects worldwide, and that together constitute unifying heuristics. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of functional stereotypes (i.e. prescriptive program typologies), and the avoidance of segregative functional zoning (i.e. impermeable separation spaces according to single function allocation). The Positive Principles include the networking of parametric activity/event scenarios, and the communication of all spaces, activities and events. Formal heuristics Similar to the Functional heuristics, there are unified Formal heuristics distinguishing Parametricism from other styles of architecture. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of rigid forms that lack malleability; the avoidance of simple repetition that lacks variety; and the avoidance of collage of isolated and unrelated elements that result in a lack of order. The Positive Principles include the intelligent information- rich deformation of soft forms; differentiation of all systems through gradients, thresholds and singularities; and interdependent correlation of all systems.Schumacher, Patrik. \\"11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style.\\" p.657 ==Projects== Munich Olympic Stadium (Frei Otto and Günther Behnisch, 1972) Proto parametricism (1952–1992) Throughout his career, Frei Otto conducted research focused on constructing light-weight, tensile structures through form-finding physical models that performed analog \\"material computation\\". This work is regarded as the precursor to Parametricism. His design for the Olympic Stadium, Munich, built for the 1972 Summer Olympics, is a celebrated example of highly innovative lightweight tent construction, designed in collaboration with the architect Günther Behnisch.

In Patrik Schumacher's view, parametricism is architecture's answer to our computationally powered network society, representing a paradigmatic shift in architecture after the collapse of the hegemonic style of Modernism, in response to the global shift from the Modernist era of Fordism (mass production) to the Post-Fordist era (mass customization). The style continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global communications. Parametricism evolves with the advancing computational design and fabrication technologies. e.g. multi-agent computational systems, genetic algorithms and robotic fabrication. However, it is imperative to state that the emergence of a new style does not occur solely as the outcome of innovation in the technological arena. \\"The intelligence that is able to invent and think through such correlations is prior to its computational implementation.

Sources differ as to whether these were naturally occurring or were planted in the area by the Pawnee. == Description == Pumpkin Creek begins at approximately 4,600 feet above sea level in southwest Scotts Bluff County. From its headwaters, the creek flows approximately 50 miles eastward at an average gradient of 20–21 feet per mile. Pumpkin Creek drains into the North Platte River southeast of Bridgeport at an altitude of approximately 3,500 feet. == Water Depletion and Response == Pumpkin Creek is an important source of irrigation water in Banner County, Nebraska. In recent years, drought and agricultural irrigation have severely depleted the water of Pumpkin Creek. The 450,700-acre Pumpkin Creek watershed receives about 16 inches of precipitation annually. According to the United States Geological Survey, in 1932, Pumpkin Creek discharged an average of 33.2 cubic feet of water per second annually. The average annual discharge of Pumpkin Creek has not exceeded 30 cubic feet of water per second since 1967, and has not exceeded 20 cubic feet of water per second since 1974 with the exception of 1988. In 1991, the most recent year that data was recorded at Pumpkin Creek by the USGS, Pumpkin Creek discharged an average of only 10.8 cubic feet of water per second. In 1996, the Nebraska Legislature passed LB 108 to address the issues of drought and surface and groundwater depletion across the state, authorizing the 23 Natural Resource Districts statewide to regulate ground and surface water usage. Subsequently, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources stopped issuing new surface water usage rights to Pumpkin Creek to combat low stream flow. LB 108 allowed the North Platte Natural Resources District to interdict the drilling of new irrigation wells in the Pumpkin Creek watershed in 2001 and a 14-acre- inch irrigation usage limit in 2004. ==See also== *List of rivers of Nebraska ==References== Category:Bodies of water of Banner County, Nebraska Category:Rivers of Knox County, Nebraska Category:Bodies of water of Morrill County, Nebraska Category:Rivers of Nebraska Category:Geography of Nebraska Category:Great Plains ","title":"Pumpkin Creek (Nebraska)"},{"id":"46395540","text":"Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians is the persecution faced by church, clergy and adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church (Orthodox Christianity) because of religious beliefs and practices. Orthodox Christians have been persecuted in various periods when under the rule of non-Orthodox Christian political structures. In modern times, anti-religious political movements and regimes in some countries have held an anti-Orthodox stance. ==Catholic activities in Early modern Europe== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Christian denominations in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573 (Catholics in yellow, Orthodox in green, Protestant in purple/gray) During the end off 16th century, under the influence of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, rising pressures towards Orthodox Christians in White Ruthenia and other Eastern parts of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led to the enforcement of the Union of Brest in 1595-96. Until that time, most Belarusians and Ukrainians who lived under the rule of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were Orthodox Christians. Pressed by the state authorities, their hierarchs gathered in synod in the city of Brest and composed 33 articles of Union, which were accepted by the Roman Catholic Church. At first, the Union appeared to be successful, but soon it lost much of its initial support, mainly due to its forceful implementation on the Orthodox parishes and subsequent persecution of all who did not want to accept the Union. Enforcement of the Union stirred several massive uprisings, particularly the Khmelnytskyi Uprising, of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and together alliance of Ukrainian Catholics and Belarussian-Ukrainian Orthodox because of which the Commonwealth lost Left-bank Ukraine. In 1656, Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Macarios III Zaim lamented over the atrocities committed by the Polish Catholics against followers of Eastern Orthodoxy in various parts of Ukraine. Macarios was quoted as stating that seventeen or eighteen thousand followers of Eastern Orthodoxy were killed under hands of the Catholics, and that he desired Ottoman sovereignty over Catholic subjugation, stating: > God perpetuate the empire of the Turks for ever and ever! For they take > their impost, and enter no account of religion, be their subjects Christians > or Nazarenes, Jews or Samaritians; whereas these accursed Poles were not > content with taxes and tithes from the brethren of Christ...The preaching of > Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker > Arnold, pp. 134–135 Habsburg Monarchy Since the many migrations of Serbs (predominantly and traditionally Eastern Orthodox) into the Habsburg Monarchy beginning in the 16th century, there were efforts to Catholicize the community. The Orthodox Eparchy of Marča became the Catholic Eparchy of Križevci after waves of Uniatization in the 17th and 18th centuries. Notable individuals active in the Catholicisation of Serbs in the 17th century include Martin Dobrović, Benedikt Vinković, Petar Petretić, Rafael Levaković, Ivan Paskvali and Juraj Parčić. Catholic bishops Vinković and Petretić wrote numerous inaccurate texts meant to incite hatred against Serbs and Orthodox Christians, some of which included advice on how to Catholicize the Serbs. ==Persecution in the Ottoman Empire== The Ottoman Empire grouped the Orthodox Christians into the Rum Millet. In tax registries, Christians were recorded as \\"infidels\\" (see giaour). After the Great Turkish War (1683–99), relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire were radicalized, gradually taking more extreme forms and resulting in occasional calls of Muslim religious leaders for expulsion or extermination of local Christians, and also Jews. As a result of Ottoman oppression, destruction of churches and violence against the non-Muslim civilian population, Serbs and their church leaders headed by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III sided with the Austrians in 1689, and again in 1737 under Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV, in war. In the following punitive campaigns, Ottoman forces conducted atrocities, resulting in the \\"Great Migrations of the Serbs\\". In retaliation of the Greek rebellion, Ottomans authorities orchestrated massacres of Greeks in Constantinople in 1821. During the Bulgarian Uprising (1876) and Russo-Turkish War (1877-78), persecution of Bulgarian Christian population was conducted by Turkish soldiers who massacred civilians, mainly in the regions of Panagurishte, Perushtitza, Bratzigovo, and Batak (see Batak massacre). ==Interwar period== The eastern part of Poland has a long history of Catholic–Orthodox rivalry. The Roman Catholic clergy in the Chełm region in Poland was unambiguously anti-Orthodox in the Interwar period. Ukraine, which has been a religious borderland, has a long history of religious conflict. ==World War II== Head of Serbian orthodox priest and Croatian Ustashe Persecution of Serbs The Croatian fascist Ustashe created the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) four days after the German invasion of Yugoslavia. Croatia was set up as an Italian protectorate. Around a third of the population was Orthodox (ethnic Serbs). The Ustashe followed Nazi ideology, and set up a goal of creating an ethnically pure Greater Croatia; Jews, Gypsies and especially Serbs were targeted and victims of genocidal policies. The Ustashe recognized both Roman Catholicism and Islam as the national religions of Croatia, but held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy, as a symbol of Serb identity, was a dangerous foe. In the spring and summer of 1941 the genocide against Orthodox Serbs began and concentration camps like Jasenovac were created. Serbs were murdered and forcibly converted, in order to Croatize, and permanently destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Catholic leadership in Croatia mostly supported the Ustashe actions. Orthodox bishops and priests were persecuted, arrested and tortured or killed (several hundreds) and hundreds (most) of Orthodox churches were closed, destroyed, or plundered by the Ustashe. Sometimes entire villages were locked inside the local Orthodox church and then set alight. Hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Serbs were forced to flee from Ustashe-held territories into territory of German-occupied Serbia. It was not until the end of the war that the Serbian Orthodox Church would function again in western parts of Yugoslavia. The persecution of Orthodox priests in World War II increased the popularity of the Orthodox Church in Serbia. ==Contemporary== At the Orthodox conference in Istanbul on 12–15 March 1992, the church leaders issued a statement: Former Yugoslavia Some Serbs viewed the Catholic leadership's support for political division along ethnic and religious lines in Croatia during the Wars in Yugoslavia, and support for the Albanian cause in Kosovo as anti-Serb and anti-Orthodox. Yugoslav propaganda during the Milošević regime portrayed Croatia and Slovenia as part of an anti-Orthodox \\"Catholic alliance\\". Russia Russian nationalists view the United States as the centre of Western anti-Russian, anti-Slavic and anti-Orthodox 'conspiracy that aims to destroy Russia', and has used the NATO intervention in the Bosnian War (1992–95) as an argument for this. In 1998 and 2000, in various towns in Russia, Orthodox fundamentalists accused texts written by liberal Orthodox theologicians of being \\"anti-Orthodox\\" and destroyed them in a public book burning.  Greece  Although Greece is predominantly of the Eastern Orthodox faith, the Greek Orthodox Church has persecuted adherents of other Eastern Orthodox churches, mainly its ethnic-Macedonian minority, who has been denied the right to establish a church belonging to the Macedonian Orthodox Church.

It is the third book in the seven- book Septimus Heap series. The story focuses primarily on the 500-year-old spirit of Queen Etheldredda, who attempts to use Septimus Heap to attain immortality. ==Synopsis== The book begins with Silas Heap and Gringe accidentally releasing the spirit of Queen Etheldredda - while Unsealing a room for Silas's Counter- Feet Colony - from a painting that she had been trapped in for 510 years. Her release also releases her pet Aie-Aie, which causes a Sickness by biting people. Once released, she drowns Septimus Heap, only to save him for blackmail. She sends Septimus to meet her son Marcellus Pye who drank an incomplete potion of immortality. Marcellus uses a magical mirror to send Septimus back in time to learn Physik from a younger version of Marcellus, in an attempt to complete the potion. Marcia finds a note from Septimus in Marcellus' book I Marcellus. Jenna Heap and Nicko Heap enlist the help of Alther Mella to attempt to travel back in time to find Septimus. Alther takes them to see Alice Nettles, who happens to be housing Snorri Snorrelssen. In Alice's warehouse, they find a Glass that allows them to travel back in time 500 years. Snorri, Jenna, and Nicko fall through the glass, but it's shattered when Spit Fyre attempts to follow them through it. Jenna is confused for the lost princess and is taken to see Etheldredda, separating her from Snorri and Nicko. She escapes when she meets Septimus by chance at a feast thrown to honor the return of the princess. Septimus, Jenna, Snorri, and Nicko attempt to pass through the Doors of Time to return to their time period, but the arrival of Etheldredda and Marcellus stop their attempt. They hide in a closet, where they witness Marcellus tell his mother that the potion is not yet completed and she therefore cannot drink it. She insists on drinking the incomplete potion. She and Marcellus then discover Septimus and the others in the closet that they were hiding in. Etheldredda drags Jenna to the Moat to attempt to drown her, but is herself drowned in the process. Due to her having drunk an incomplete potion she is reincarnated as an incomplete spirit. Septimus, Jenna, and Nicko decide to travel through the Doors of Time to return to their own time period, but Nicko leaves in search of Snorri, who had herself gone in search of her cat, Ullr. Septimus and Jenna return to the present without Nicko or Snorri. Back at the castle, the ghost of Etheldredda attempts to kill Jenna using the IP (Infant Princess) bullet from Magyk, but the bullet instead hits Alice, who throws herself in front of Jenna to protect her. Marcia then uses Spit Fyre's fire to destroy Etheldredda's portrait, which in turn destroys the ghosts of Etheldredda and the Aie-Aie. Septimus then uses his newfound knowledge of Physik to create an antidote for the Sickness. ==Characters== *Septimus Heap: The seventh son of a seventh son, youngest child of Sarah and Silas Heap.

With service to Juneau, CCFR provides emergency services to the second most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage, and the fourth largest metropolitan area behind Anchorage, the Fairbanks North Star Borough, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Areas served by CCFR include Douglas Island, Lemon Creek, the Mendenhall Valley, Juneau International Airport, Thane, University of Alaska Southeast and local areas of the Tongass National Forest. ==History== Medic 1, an ambulance and paramedic unit operated by Capital City Fire/Rescue, in downtown Juneau on 18 April 2015 CCFR fights a fire in the abandoned Gastineau Apartments (left) on March 21, 2015 The first fire agency in the Juneau area was founded in 1899 as the Juneau Volunteer Fire Department, consisting of a single, hand-powered hose cart. Gradually, as the local population increased and spread further out, other fire companies formed and sprouted up in the area. These included the Douglas Fire Department in 1898, the private fire company at the Treadwell Mine, and the Auke Bay VFD in 1952. In 1992, to better manage emergency services in the community, all of the fire companies in the Juneau area, including Glacier Fire District, Auke Bay Vol. Fire Department, Douglas Vol. Fire Department, and the Juneau Fire Department merged into Capital City Fire/Rescue. This was a full merger, which is why units and personnel, regardless of district, wear the same uniform under the same \\"chain of command.\\" The first alarm system consisted of a bell installed on the boardwalk, adjacent to the downtown ship docks. Upgrades to the alarm system began in 1915, and the methods of notifying fire fighters who are off duty that they are needed became more high tech over the years. As of 2016, all CCFR members are issued both a pager and a dispatching application for smartphones. In 2006, the City and Borough of Juneau purchased a mobile dispatch center, with a grant from the Department of Homeland Security. The mobile command center is equipped to provide multiple agencies access to dispatch, while providing office space for emergency personnel who are in command at the site of a major incident. ==Current Day== As of 2016, Capital City Fire and Rescue is made up of 33 paid and 70 volunteer firefighters and Emergency Medical Technicians, as well as 9 administrative support staff, who serve over 31,000 residents in the city and borough of Juneau. Paid, professional firefighter/paramedics work out of the Downtown and Glacier/Juneau International Airport stations offering fire/rescue, Advanced Life Support-staffed ambulance service, and aircraft crash rescue and firefighting services. Some ALS firefighters are also trained to be able to fly medevac missions via local contract helicopter companies, however, most are handled by outside agencies. Volunteer members, including those enrolled in the department's \\"live-in\\" program, respond to calls out of the Douglas Island, Auke Bay and Lynn Canal stations. Due to the complexity of the environment Juneau lies in, the department also offers \\"Special Teams\\" which include rope and technical rescue and water/ice rescue teams. Annually, Capital City Fire Rescue offers an \\"in-house\\" ISFA and Alaska State Firefighter I & II academy as well as a state approved EMT class to help train volunteer recruits, held at the agency's Training Center. 911 and emergency dispatching services are handled by the City of Juneau, who also dispatch Juneau Police, U.S. Forest Service and NOAA law enforcement as well as the Alaska State Troopers. Adding to the challenges faced by the emergency system in the land-locked city of Juneau are the influx of upwards of 18,000 additional people a day from cruise ship and tourist traffic during the summer months. May through September, CCFR hires four additional firefighter/EMT's to staff a Basic Life Support ambulance downtown in a seasonal hire program to facilitate medical transports from the cruise ships, Bartlett Regional Hospital and air ambulance services. During this five-month period the extra ambulance will handle approximately 500 calls for service. This program frees up the Advanced Life Support ambulances to continue to respond to emergencies that require the higher level of care. This has reduced the number of times that all in-service ambulances were unavailable due to the call load and reduced response times across the city and borough. At the close of 2016, CCF/R announced that it had responded to 4,517 calls for service, which broke down to 77 fire calls, 3,406 medical emergencies, 186 fire alarms, 15 fuel spills and 833 \\"other\\" calls for service, including assisting law enforcement, \\"smell of smoke,\\" open burn investigations and public service calls. CCFR personnel responded to an average of 12.3 calls per day throughout the year, with numbers as high as 35 in the peak summertime months. The 2016 call volume for CCF/R was a 12.3% increase from the previous year. ==Volunteer, Cadet and Live-In Programs== At any given time, CCFR has a volunteer force of approximately 70 members, allowing a reserve force to back up the full-time staffed fire stations. Volunteer firefighters are assigned to the Auke Bay, Lynn Canal and Douglas Island fire stations, but can also backfill the fire stations Downtown and at the airport. Volunteer training is varied depending on the member. Some members volunteer as \\"Scene Support,\\" which includes rehab operations, tool and equipment running and other basic \\"non-entry firefighter\\" operations, while others will move through a full fire academy, becoming Alaska State Firefighter I and II. EMS-only members will usually dual-function as Scene Support. CCFR also offers a high school career-exploration \\"Cadet\\" program, in which teenagers ages 14–18 can experience the fire and emergency services hands-on. Following the application process, Cadets begin their time with a four-month long academy, in which they learn basic fire service history and operations. Upon graduation, Cadets are utilized as Scene Support members, and can ride-a-long with volunteer and career members on emergency calls, gaining an immersive, first-hand experience in the fire service. Capital City Fire Rescue offers a \\"live-in\\" program, where some volunteer firefighters, after a selective application and interview process, are allowed to live in firehouses as residents. This program allows CCFR to \\"staff\\" apparatus in areas that otherwise would see relatively longer response times, such as Lynn Canal or Douglas Island. Most \\"live-ins\\" hold both Firefighter I and EMT certification at bare minimum and staff the firehouses from approx. 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 A.M. the following day. While this program reduces the average response time of personnel arriving on scene of a call in the city and borough of Juneau, it does not always guarantee 100% coverage for that area, as many \\"live-ins\\" also maintain full-time jobs outside of the fire department. ==Notable Incidents== In January 1898, a fire caused by an exploding lamp in the Marshall's office burned down the city jail and courthouse. The fire resulted in the release of 14 inmates, most of whom escaped. Both buildings were a total loss and only a few of the prisoners were recaptured, however most court records, locked in a fire-resistant safe, survived. The \\"Evening News\\" out of San Jose, California, reported that \\"the illumination was seen for forty miles up Lynn Canal, and it lighted up beautifully the surrounding mountains of snow.\\" The fire is largely regarded as the \\"final straw\\" in the need for implementing a town fire department. In March 1911, a fire started by an inattentive cook at the Douglas Grill nearly burned down the town of Douglas. While there was a quick response by the Douglas Fire Department, the firefighters were met with frozen fire hydrants and the fire quickly grew out of control, spreading to the Douglas Hotel, Island Hotel and Lyric theater. Mutual aid was struck and personnel from the Juneau Fire Department, who responded with two engines and over 600 feet of hose, were brought over by the ferry steamer Georgia. Approx. 100 firefighting personnel from the Douglas- Treadwell Mine Fire Department also responded. The firefighters were able to stop the fire from spreading to the rest of the town by using the metal corrugated wall in the Reine Saloon as a check point, and pushing the fire towards two empty lots. Despite gloomy outlooks by citizens at the scene, the firefighters were able to make the stop and are largely credited with saving the town. On May 24, 1946, during overhaul operations following a series of stubborn fires at the Perelle Apartments in downtown Juneau, volunteer firefighter Bill Rudolph fell approx. 20 feet off a ladder, landing on his head and shoulders, knocking him briefly unconscious. Rudolph passed away 7 days later from injuries resulting from the fall, becoming the Juneau area's only firefighter line of duty death. Rudolph was stationed in Juneau as a Chief Boatswain's Mate in the U.S. Coast Guard. On 15 August 2004, Capital City Fire/Rescue responded to a fire in the Skinner Building, on Front Street in downtown Juneau. The 108-year-old structure contained 18 businesses. During the fire, the heat and smoke caused the evacuation of over 1,000 people in the local downtown area, and closed most business down. As the fire intensified, it spread to another building next door. The Skinner Building was completely destroyed, and total damages were in excess of one million dollars. On 5 November 2012, the 4-story Gastineau Apartments on Franklin Street in downtown Juneau caught fire. Every available member of Capital City Fire/Rescue responded to the blaze, which burned throughout the night. The apartments and other local buildings were evacuated by CCFR and members of the Juneau Police Department. The building was a total loss. During the fire fighting effort, power was shut off to downtown Juneau, and members of the Alaska Army National Guard were deployed to keep people out of the evacuated area. Extra firefighters were brought in from Sitka on a Coast Guard helicopter, and even a member of the Anchorage Fire Department, who was visiting Juneau at the time, was also pressed into service. Despite the size of the fire, no injuries were reported. ==See also== * Anchorage Fire Department * Juneau Mountain Rescue ==References== Category:1899 establishments in Alaska Category:Fire departments in Alaska Category:Juneau, Alaska Category:Pre-statehood history of Alaska Category:Government agencies established in 1899 ","title":"Capital City Fire/Rescue"},{"id":"46395915","text":"Sydney Ferries Limited operated ferry services on Sydney Harbour from 1900 until June 1951. The company grew out of the North Shore Steam Ferry Company and took over smaller ferry operators to become the largest ferry operator in Sydney's history. Without a physical connection across the harbour, demand for ferry services to developing areas on the North Shore rose dramatically and Sydney Ferries commissioned 27 large ferries in its own right between 1900 and 1922. The company named its vessels with Australian Aboriginal words beginning with \\"K\\". The 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge saw the companies annual patronage drop from 40 million to 15 million. ==Nineteenth century beginnings== The first regular passenger ferry services across the harbour began in the 1840s and 1850s, at which time the Gerrard Brother's ran paddle steamers Ferry Queen, Brothers, and Agenoria. Herald was sent out from England for the North Shore Steam Company and later for E Evans and Partners. Demand for passengers services had developed to the point that in 1861, the forerunner to Sydney Ferries Limited, the North Shore Ferry Company, was formed as an unincorporated company. Its backers included James Milson and Francis Lord. The company's first ferries was Kirribilli (I). Nell, Galatea and Coombra followed. Land subdivision from the 1870s saw development east of Milsons Point in the Neutral Bay and Mosman, New South Wales areas. Mosman was first an excursion area and residential development had suffered until the regular ferry services began in the 1870s. It became a limited liability company, the North Shore Steam Ferry Company Ltd, in 1878. On 14 December 1899, the company was incorporated as Sydney Ferries Limited. It subsequently took over the Parramatta River Steamers and Tramway Co. Ltd. (in 1901), the Balmain New Ferry Co. Ltd. in 1917 and the Watsons Bay and South Shore Steam Ferry Co. Ltd. in 1920. Sydney Ferries acquired some innovative technology from its predecessor companies, notably the double-ended screw ferry design in which Sydney was a world leader at the time. In 1879, the North Shore Co. introduced Sydney's first, and the world's second, double-ended screw ferry, Wallaby. This remained the basic design of all Sydney double-ended screw ferries. However, the company continued to acquire paddle-steamers until 1885. They serviced the harbour's busiest route from Circular Quay to Milsons Point (50 years later the location of the Sydney Harbour Bridge) and Lavender Bay to which an all-night service was added in 1884. Milson's Point became the harbour's busiest wharf with the introduction of a connecting tram service from Ridge St North Sydney. It became busier still in 1893 with the connection of the North Shore railway line from Hornsby. In late 1899, the North Shore Co. was reincorporated as Sydney Ferries Limited. At this stage, the fleet comprised 27 vessels including four vehicular ferries and two cargo ferries. It ordered the first double-ended propeller-driven ferry in the world to be built. ==Early twentieth-century expansion== The first 20 years of the twentieth century were a time of significant growth in demand for ferry services on the harbour, and Sydney Ferries grew rapidly. Between 1900 and 1910, the company took over the Parramatta Service, and commenced services to The Spit and Clontarf via Athol and Balmoral. It also took over and ran services to the Athol Gardens Hotel. In 1906, the company purchased the Thompson estate at Clifton Gardens (in Mosman) including land, the three- storey hotel, wharf dancing pavilion and skating rink. The company built a large circular swimming enclosure that could hold 3,000 spectators, a boatshed and a tramway from the wharf to the hotel. Before the First World War, ferries full of picnickers came at weekends. The structure burnt down in 1956. Between 1910 and 1920, services to Watsons Bay, Balmain, Hunters Hill, Lane Cove were taken over by the company. In December 1911, a service to Robertsons (Cremorne) Point was added to meet the new tram service. The first service to Taronga Zoo commenced on 24 September 1916 with a vehicular ferry taking the elephant 'Jessi' across the harbour to her new home from the old zoo at Moore Park. Sydney Ferries at this stage had a near monopoly on Sydney Harbour ferry services, except for the Manly ferry service and several small launch services. In addition to buying out most of the other ferry operators and their assets,Sydney Ferries Transport for NSW between 1900 and 1914 the company acquired 25 large vessels - mostly of the type known as the K-class - on its own accord. The company's largest vessels, Kuttabul and Koompartoo were delivered in 1922, each with a capacity of over 2,000 passengers for the heavy lift Circular Quay to Milson's Point run. They were the last and the largest of the K-class ferries and were made redundant with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. ==Post Harbour Bridge opening== Prior to the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the company carried more than 40 million passengers per annum, three-quarters of which travelled on the Milsons Point- Circular Quay route. With the completion of the bridge in 1932, the company's passenger volumes dropped to 15 million. The large Milsons Point ferries, Koompartoo and Kuttabul were immediately redundant and used mainly for concert and showboat work until the outbreak of World War II. Some of their larger boats were also laid up, and a dozen smaller ferries were scrapped. Most of these were older vessels, almost 20 ferries were decommissioned. Vehicular ferry services between Dawes Point and Blues Point, and between Bennelong Point to Milsons Point ceased less than two weeks after the bridge's opening on 19 March 1932. The 350-ton vehicular ferries, Koondooloo (1924), Kalang (1926) and Kara Kara (1926) were laid up. Other vehicular ferries were scrapped, however, Kooroongaba went to work crossing the Hunter River between Stockton and Newcastle. In the mid-1930s, demand for harbour cruises increased and the company fitted out Koondooloo as a two-deck showboat. Such was her success, that Kalang was similarly fitted out as a three-deck showboat, and a third deck was later added to Koondooloo. The newer series of \\"Lady\\" class ferries - Ladies Chelmsford (1910), Denman (1912), Edeline (1913), Scott (1914), and Ferguson (1914) - were converted to more efficient diesel power. Sisters Karingal and Karrabee (1913), the smallest of the \\"K-class\\" ferries, were converted to diesel in the mid 1930s. As part of a refresh and change in direction following the bridge opening, the \\"K-class\\" and \\"Lady-class\\" varnished timber with white trim livery was painted over with a green on the hull and bulwarks, and yellow painted superstructure. The black funnels were repainted yellow with black tops. The post-Bridge drop in demand for the ferry fleet was somewhat mitigated by the Great Depression of the 1930s as many could not afford their own transport. Fuel rationing during World War 2 made the coal required for the steam ferries relatively cheap.Kirawa on ferriesofsydney.com However, the post World War II years saw the drop in demand pick up pace. In 1951, with annual patronage down to 9 million and the business having become unprofitable, Sydney Ferries Ltd advised the Government of New South Wales of its intention to cease operating ferry services.Move to Sell Sydney Ferries to the State Government Sydney Morning Herald 16 February 1951Fifty Years of Sydney Public Ferries Afloat Magazine May 2009 After investigating the possibility of using statutory powers to compulsorily acquire the business without paying compensation, the government agreed to purchase of the fleet for a nominal sum, and on 1 July 1951 the 15 ferries and the workshops were sold to the government agency established for the purpose, the Sydney Harbour Transport Board.Sydney Harbour Transport Board NSW State Records Sydney Ferries continued its business through its freight and showboat cruise company, Harbour Lighterage Pty. Ltd., which had been established as Harbor Land and Transport Co, Ltd. in 1918, retaining ownership of the showboat and former vehicular ferry Kalang. The government contracted out operation of the fleet and Balmain workshops to the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, through a subsidiary set up for the purpose, Sydney Harbour Ferries Pty. Ltd. The services and fleet were quickly rationalised with most of the larger remaining timber K-class steamers being decommissioned. Kirrule, Kiandra, Kameruka and Kamiri and Kirawa were all broken up at this time, and Kareela and Kubu followed in 1959. Kosciusko and Kanangra were converted to diesel and were the heavy lift vessels until 1975 and 1985 respectively. ==See also== * List of Sydney Harbour ferries ==References== Category:Ferry companies of New South Wales Category:Ferry transport in Sydney Category:1861 establishments in Australia Category:1951 disestablishments in Australia Category:Defunct companies of Australia ","title":"Sydney Ferries Limited"},{"id":"46395918","text":"Shastripuram is an area in the Old City of Hyderabad, India.

Heading south from the southern portal of the tunnel, the railway first crosses the River Limmat and Hardturmstrasse on a concrete viaduct. Still on viaduct the line splits into two, with the right hand leg being a single-track viaduct that descends into Zürich Altstetten station. The left hand leg, still double track and on viaduct, runs into the upper level of Zürich Hardbrücke station, before continuing its descent into the Hauptbahnhof. The tunnel was opened in 1969. As built, only the Altstetten leg of the southern connecting lines existed, and the tunnel was only usable by freight and other trains that bypassed Hauptbahnhof station. In 1982, Hardbrücke station and its leg of the connecting lines opened, allowing the tunnel to be used by trains running between Hauptbahnhof and Oerlikon. Today the tunnel carries Zürich S-Bahn lines S5, S6, S7, S9, S15, S16 and S21, all of which operate via Hardbrücke. It also carries freight traffic, which runs via the Altstetten link.

It was released by Strike Force Entertainment / Cherry Red Records on 7 July 2014. ==Background== Ten Plagues is a 2014 studio recording of the 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe Award-winning stage production of the same name. The production was performed again at Wilton's Music Hall in 2013 and was well reviewed. The production is a song cycle duet for voice and piano and was written by Mark Ravenhill with music by Conor Mitchell. Almond wanted to work with Ravenhill after he saw the latter's Mother Clap's Molly House production, so he approached Ravenhill who wrote the Ten Plagues libretto in response. Ten Plagues is about the Great Plague of London of 1665 on one level but also acts as a metaphor for \\"the hysteria with which the public habitually greets all threats of mass infection, from swine flu to SARS\\" and alludes to the \\"first onrush of AIDS\\". The CD was released as a double digipak and came with a DVD of the live stage show filmed at Wilton's Music Hall. ==Critical reception== The studio recording was not as well reviewed as the live show and divided critics. The Financial Times review by Ludovic Hunter-Tilney finds the libretto \\"routine\\" and calls the piano score \\"atonal\\", summarising that \\"the results fall flat\\". Neil Gardner of The Times liked it better, naming it \\"grimly fascinating\\" calling the piano score \\"barreling\\", whilst \\"versatile\\" Almond's vocals are \\"soaring\\". David Sheppard writes in the Mojo review that \\"Almond tackles often tricky, convoluted melodies with great gusto\\" but closes by stating that accompanying live DVD \\"makes more sense\\". ==Track listing== Libretto by Mark Ravenhill, music by Conor Mitchell. # \\"Spring\\" –1:44 # \\"A Comet\\" – 2:41 # \\"Without a Word\\" – 4:50 # \\"To Dream\\" – 2:55 # \\"Market\\" – 1:59 # \\"The Pit\\" – 3:44 # \\"Farewell\\" – 3:00 # \\"By Day\\" – 2:36 # \\"A New Law\\" – 1:52 # \\"Seeing You\\" – 5:34 # \\"The Wig\\" – 4:32 # \\"The Hermit\\" – 3:22 # \\"Grief\\" – 4:05 # \\"Quacker\\" – 2:57 # \\"Return\\" – 5:48 # \\"Ten Plagues / Epilogue\\" – 4:38 ==Personnel== *Marc Almond – vocals *Conor Mitchell – piano ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Marc Almond albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums Category:Song cycles Category:Dark cabaret soundtracks ","title":"Ten Plagues – A Song Cycle"},{"id":"46396146","text":"Alessandra Moretti (born 24 June 1973 in Vicenza) is an Italian politician who has been serving as a Member of the European Parliament since 2019. ==Early life and education== Moretti graduated in law at the University of Urbino and has worked as a divorce lawyer since 2001. ==Political career== Since her young age, Moretti was interested in politics, following her father, who had been active in the Italian Communist Party. She first entered politics with the Democrats of the Left. After some failed electoral campaigns (notably including that of the 2007 provincial election of Vicenza, on a list in support of Giorgio Carollo of Veneto for the EPP), in 2008 Moretti, who joined the Democratic Party (PD), was elected to the municipal council of Vicenza and was appointed Deputy Mayor with delegation for education and youth. In 2012 Moretti gained national prominence when she was appointed by Pier Luigi Bersani spokeswoman of his campaign for the centre-left primary election. In the event, Bersani won the nomination for Prime Minister, but lost the 2013 general election. Moretti was however elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the PD. In the 2014 European Parliament election Moretti was elected to the European Parliament but resigned in February 2015 to contest local elections and was replaced by Damiano Zoffoli. In the 2015 Venetian regional election Moretti ran for President of Veneto, but gained a mere 22.7% of the vote and was thus defeated by incumbent President Luca Zaia of Northern League, who secured 50.1% of the vote. In the 2019 European elections, Moretti re-entered the European Parliament. She has since been serving on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

It makes hard cider using apples from their own 60-acre orchard located in Hudson Valley, New York. In its first year, the cider was only available in New England, Colorado, Maryland, and New York. In 2012, it was introduced nationwide (with its three flagship flavors, Crisp Apple, Traditional Dry, and Apple Ginger) and quickly captured 40% of the United States hard cider market, rising to 50% by 2014 and comprising 20% of the Boston Brewing Company's output. ==History== In 2016, Angry Orchard teamed with treehouse builder Pete Nelson to create a treehouse tasting room on Animal Planet's Treehouse Masters. In March 2019, Angry Orchard launched their Cider+Food App, a first-of-its-kind augmented reality experience that brings cider and food pairings to life. Users of the app can scan their phones over Angry Orchard's bottles of their core styles—Crisp Apple, Rosé, Easy Apple and Pear, with the digital experience guided by head cidermaker Ryan Burk. As of June 2019, the Cider+Food App is made available only on the App Store (iOS) for all iPhones running on iOS 12. In 2019, Angry Orchard was the top-selling cider brand in the United States, with sales of $220.1 million that year. ==Controversy== On August 4, 2015, Angry Orchard had a voluntary recall of select cases of its hard cider due to concerns of refermentation in the bottles. This decision was made after consumer inquiries about bottles that were broken or overflowing when opened, as well as several follow-up quality tests. ==See also== * Samuel Adams (beer) ==References== Category:American ciders Category:Companies based in Orange County, New York ","title":"Angry Orchard"},{"id":"46396154","text":"Kim Seo-hyeon (born December 10, 1993), known professionally as Katie Kim, or by the mononym KATIE, is a South Korean-born American singer based in Los Angeles who finished first in K-pop Star 4. Her breakthrough performance of \\"Where You Need To Be\\" reached 4 million views on South Korea's leading video- sharing site, Naver TV Cast, in the shortest amount of time in K-pop Star history. After winning the show, she decided to sign with YG Entertainment. In May 2018, Katie joined AXIS, a new company founded by former YG creative director SINXITY. With a change of label, YG Entertainment will continue to help with the distribution of her debut album. Her debut extended play, Log, was released on May 22, 2019. ==Early life== Katie Kim was born Kim Seo-hyeon on December 10, 1993 in Bucheon. She immigrated to New Jersey at the age of 10. Her mother would play classical music when she was a child, and she realized that she wanted to be a singer in her high school years. She studied jazz at the Berklee College of Music, but had to drop out due to financial difficulties burdening her family. == Career == Katie applied for K-pop Star 4 to further her career back in South Korea. She emerged as the winner for the season, and she opted to sign with YG Entertainment, and she became a trainee under the agency. After winning she performed live for the first time with hip-hop duo, Jinusean, with their latest hit, \\"Tell Me One More Time\\", which she performed at SBS Inkigayo. She spent three years under YG, where she recorded several songs and produced music videos, and YG noticed her preference for American music. She also visited the United States to participate in songwriting camps, where she wrote most of her songs for her album. Despite this, development for her solo album stagnated and was repeatedly delayed. Producer SJ \\"SINXITY\\" Shin, who oversaw Katie's album, eventually left YG to create his own label, AXIS, which complicated the schedule of her debut. SINXITY wanted Katie to join AXIS, and after consulting with YG founder Yang Hyun-suk, she decided to leave YG to join AXIS in May 2018, with YG Plus continuing to distribute her album. She became the label's first artist, and she gained more creative control with her music under AXIS. She debuted with the single \\"Remember\\" from her debut extended play, Log, on June 6, 2018. The music video was uploaded on YG's official YouTube channel, and has since received over 10 million views on the platform. A second single was supposed to be released on August 8, with the release of Log by October 10. The positive reception to the song resulted in her delaying her EP due to newfound interest from record labels, and she ultimately partnered with AWAL for distribution. She released a Spotify Singles EP in October 2018, which included live versions of \\"Remember\\" and a cover of India Arie's \\"Beautiful Surprise\\". She moved to Los Angeles in April 2019. \\"Remember\\" was re-released on April 17, with Ty Dolla Sign as a featured artist; her manager previously managed Ty Dolla Sign, and he contacted him for the collaboration. She released her second single, \\"Thinkin Bout You\\", on May 21, with Log releasing a day later. Katie performed at the Seoul Jazz Festival on May 25. ==Artistry== Kim's primary influences include jazz, soul, funk, and R&B; musicians such as Aaliyah, Frank Sinatra, Lalah Hathaway, Nao, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, H.E.R., Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, and Frank Ocean, most of which she listened to as a student in Berklee. == Discography ==  Extended play  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:5em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:6.9em;\\" Sales - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" KOR - ! scope=\\"row\\" Log  * Released: May 22, 2019 * Label: AXIS * Formats: CD, digital download  —  -  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt;\\" \\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. }  Singles  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\"Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:3em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10.9em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" KOR - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Remember\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2018  — rowspan=\\"1\\"  Log - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Echo\\"  —  rowspan=\\"1\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Future Love\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" 2019  — rowspan=\\"3\\"  Log - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Remember\\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign)  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Thinkin Bout You\\"  — -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt;\\" \\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. }  As featured artist  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em; Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:2em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  KOR - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Secret\\" (Bobby featuring Katie Kim & DK)  2017  —   Love and Fall -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt;\\"\\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. }  Other charted songs  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:11em;Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:2em;\\"Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Peak positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:9em;\\"Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  KOR * * * - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Where You Need To Be\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2015  5  * KOR: 202,124+Cumulative Sales for Where you Need to be: * *  K-pop Star Season 4 Top 10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"One Candle\\"  74  * KOR: 21,472+  K-pop Star Season 4 Top 6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Only You\\" (너뿐이야)  62  * KOR: 29,608+  K-pop Star Season 4 Top 2 -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt;\\"\\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. } Music Video { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center; table-layout:fixed; margin-right:0\\" !

For we are reminded by the author in Book I of a well-known tale that the protagonist, Willehalm, March Count of Provence, wooed and won Arabel, daughter of King Terramer and wife of King Tibalt, and brought her from Spain to France where he converted her to Christianity, changed her name to Giburc, and took her to wife. So Terramer and Tibalt, with numerous other kings from Spain, invade France and roundly defeat Willehalm in a battle so severe that he alone escapes alive. But Willehalm then secures the aid of King Louis of France, returns with a large force, and defeats the Muslims on the same battlefield.Charles E.

The traditional lands of the Arrernte people before European settlement, the first pastoral lease was granted in 1880. The station includes the Mac Clark Conservation Reserve, created to help preserve the rare Acacia peuce tree. ==Location== It is situated in the locality of Ghan about south of Ltyentye Apurte Community and south east of Alice Springs. The property shares a boundary with Crown Point Station to the west, Allambi to the north west, Pmere Nyenti Aboriginal Lands trust to the north and east and the border with South Australia to the south. The homestead is the easternmost habitation on the western side of the Simpson Desert. ==Description== The station occupies an area of and the largest privately held station in Australia. The property is situated on the western edge of the Simpson Desert and has a portion of the ephemeral Finke River flowing through the property. It is composed of a mix of land systems including desert sand plains and sand dunes, gibber plains, low hills and rises, flood-out country, swamps and lakes. The swamplands are found between tall dunes and only flood intermittently. Vegetation communities include large areas of spinifex grassland, saltbush shrublands, and acacia and eucalypt woodlands. ==History== The traditional owners of the area are the Arrente peoples, who lived and travelled through the area for thousands of years. The area is rich in Aboriginal artefacts and the name of the property is derived from a word meaning stone tool in Southern Arrente (aka Pertame), one of the Arrernte language dialects. A portion of the area that is now part of the Andado leaseholding was held by Willoghby and Gordon in 1880. By 1909 the same area was first occupied by Robert Sharpe and David Mayfield. The Andado lease was first taken up by Robert MacDill in 1909. He sank several bores in the area and in 1914 gained more leases with his brother Robert David MacGill and Henry Stanley Roper. Shortly afterward a mud brick dwelling was built. Another homestead was built in 1922 after Robert got married and his wife came to live at the station. This homestead remains and is known as the Old Andado homestead. Sheep were introduced to the property at around the same time and several good seasons followed with plentiful rains. By the late 1920s drought struck the area and like many in the area the MacDill's struggled. By 1933 the property was running 1300 sheep, 420 cattle and 116 horses. The MacDill family sold the property in 1942 and it changed hands several times until H. H. Overton acquired the property in 1955. Overton set up a partnership with experienced station manager Malcolm Clark, better known as Mac. The Clark family arrived at Andado in 1955. Molly and Mac Clark and their three sons, Graham, Kevin and Philip, initially lived in the original homestead that was built in the 1920s but was prone to flooding. In 1960 they moved into a new homestead that was built to the west of the old one on higher ground. By 1969 the Clark family owned Andado outright and by 1972 they commenced work on restoring the old abandoned homestead which was used to accommodate tourists. In 1978 Mac suffered a heart attack and died a week later. Molly sold the property following a decision by the federal government in 1984 to eradicate Brucellosis and Tuberculosis on all cattle in the Northern Territory which forced all of the stock on the property to be destroyed. In 1986 Molly sold the station except for the homestead and 45 square kilometres named Old Andado to be run as a stand-alone tourist destination. The Mac Clark Conservation Reserve was established in 1982 within the station boundaries to preserve the rare Acacia peuce tree of which there is a stand of 1,000 mature trees found about north of the old homestead. During the 1900s most of these trees had been cut down to make shelters and stockyards until there were only three populations left: One at Andado, another near to Birdsville and the last near Boulia. The area had been struck by drought from 2001 with minimal rains for the next eight years. In 2009 Don and Colleen Costello took over Andado after selling Mount Ebenezer Station. The Costellos also acquired New Crown and Lilla Creek Station which together occupy an area of . Don and Colleen live on New Crown with managers, Wayne and Clarice Kimlin, in charge at Andado. Later the same year rains came and the Finke River flowed for the first time in over a decade. The property was stocked up with 3,000 head of cattle shortly afterward. By 2018, Andado Station was reported to be run by Viv Oldfield. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations *List of the largest stations in Australia ==References== Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory Category:1909 establishments in Australia ","title":"Andado"},{"id":"46396333","text":"Goose Creek is a stream in Preble County, Ohio, in the United States.

Cher, who is said to be the creator of the local chilli crab dish, sold stir-fried crabs mixed with bottled chilli and tomato sauce at the stall. The couple eventually expanded their business to establish a restaurant, Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant, along Upper East Coast Road in the early 1960s. The restaurant was named Palm Beach, as there were coconut palms along the beach just outside the restaurant. Up till 1985, they remained in a coffee-shop along Upper East Coast Road, holding a menu of 9 crab dishes. When Cher and Lim migrated to New Zealand in the 1980s, Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant was eventually bought over by Han Jin Juan. In 1985, Palm Beach merged with the Fisherman restaurant and moved to Halifax Road. After the premises were burned down in a fire, Palm Beach relocated to the National Stadium in Kallang Park in October 1985. In 2008, they moved to One Fullerton along Fullerton Road, and they have remained there to the present day. Today, their One Fullerton restaurant mainly attracts a crowd of working professionals and tourists. ==Company Profile== Today, Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant offers more than 100 items on their menu, with chilli crab being their signature dish. As the current owner and managing director, Han Jin Juan keeps himself up to date on the latest trends, which helps to develop Palm Beach’s menu. Head Chef, Wong Ah Kun, runs the kitchen and has worked at Palm Beach for 20 years. According to Chef Wong, Palm Beach takes pride in ensuring that they “keep their recipes consistent and do not compromise on food quality.” Company Practices To help increase productivity, Palm Beach has implemented some of the following initiatives: *In 2005, restaurant staff carried PDAs to transmit orders wirelessly. To improve efficiency, the restaurant upgraded its mobile point of sales (POS) system to take orders via tablet computers instead of PDAs in 2011. To gather customer feedback, guests are also handed the tablets at the end of every meal. *The restaurant had adopted the Japanese 5S system, a housekeeping technique for kitchens, in 2008. With items clearly labeled and sorted, staff can retrieve items quickly, helping to reduce the amount of time spent training new staff. *Palm Beach is the first Singaporean restaurant to launch the Mystery Diner programme in 2005, in collaboration with the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) and SPRING Singapore. The mystery diner audit is a means for the company to improve service standards. As a result of these initiatives, Han reported that his company’s profits had grown between 10 and 15 per cent annually, from 2008 to 2012. ==Notable Projects== In 1994, Palm Beach ventured into the franchise business and awarded their first franchise to an Indonesian company, Sinovo Foods. In 2008, Palm Beach restaurant collaborated with other notable local seafood restaurants, Jumbo Seafood and Seafood International, to start up two Singapore Seafood Republic outlets in Tokyo, featuring Singapore seafood dishes. After the success of their first two restaurants in Tokyo, they set up other outlets in Singapore (2010), Osaka(2011) and Tokyo (2013). ==Awards== Selected awards achieved by Palm Beach restaurant: {  - !

At its height, his massive timber depots with attendant offices and bungalows for managers extended across the Himalayas from Lahore to Wazirabad in what later became Pakistan, Jammu to Pathankot, Kartanya Ghat and Kaurilya Ghat and C.B.Ganj Bareilly, Bihar and Tanakpur, Kathgodam and Pithoragarh and Haldwani to Goalpara and Garo Hills as well as Bardiya district and Kathmandu in Nepal. Vast properties purchased by his father and him at each location led to his immersion in local lore as a folk hero, who rode on a horse, with hands always full to give. At its height his father's company, D. S. Bist and Sons, consisted of Dev Singh Bist, Dan Singh Bist and his younger brother, Mohan Singh Bist. DS Bist and Sons employed over 5000 people and had tens of millions of rupees in business. but was bidding for contracts in the Andamans and even Brazil when Dan Singh Bisht met his death after completing his last purchase of Beldanga Sugar Mill in Murshidabad. He collapsed in his suite at the Grand Hotel (Kolkata) due to health and stress caused by the anti-business pandora's box the newly independent India opened. He had recently sold the plant he had set up at a discount, sensing no solution, as the Government had refused his machinery to leave Calcutta Port despite having first authorized Dan Singh Bist to take a hefty loan to procure the same. The Bisht Industrial Corporation Ltd. which was formed by D. S. Bisht and sons of Nainital in whose favour an industrial licence was granted in 1956 to set up a sugar factory of two thousand tonnes capacity a day at Kichha to meet the 'crying need' of the cultivators, of sugar-cane in district Nainital. But after Dan Singh Bisht sold his shares in 1963, and subsequently died the next year, it did not run even for a day and was ultimately taken over by Government, by an ordinance issued on 12 September 1970 which was replaced by Bisht Industrial Corporation Limited (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, No. 7 of 1971. Bisht's empire began to collapse even as he lay in hospital in a coma, dying ultimately on 10 September 1964. He had no son, and his was a patriarchal society. His daughters were children, or just married. The fate of Beldanga sugar mill is unknown, as Dan Singh Bisht fell into a coma the day after procurement and his daughters were mostly minors. The mill at Kichha is now a governmental-run mill. His prime real estate in Nainital, several architecturally significant British cottages with lake views, of several acres each such as Primrose, Cambridge Hall, and Grasmere are alienated, and as well as several bungalows and timber depots scattered across his areas of operation. The Tea gardens of Chaukori and Berinag collapsed almost immediately or began steady descent into anarchy, in the absence of a central intelligence, and combined with socialistic policies and inaction of the Government, Berinag became a town with a population of 25,000 inhabitants and a living breathing municipality where the tea estate used to be, as documented by the Sub-divisional Magistrate of Tehsil at Berinag, in October, 2004 in a report to the Chief Secretary and District Magistrate. and Chaukori remained in a state of neglect. The dairy farm at Chaukori shut down. The fruit producing and eucalyptus tree export power house 'Dhara Farms' near Moradabad was taken by the Government under new anti-landlord rules. The history of these farms, among the biggest in India, at the time, is interesting. One Raja Gajendra Shah of Moradabad, incurred massive debts to the state, and died in 1943. Unpaid debts allowed the State to acquire these massive lands and these were then bought by Bisht for 235,000 rupees on 30 October 1945. Its brand was so strong that even after Dan Singh died, from 1964 till the late 1980s, Berinag tea continued to be actively sought by people who loved and remembered its kippery taste, rich red colour and taste, and 'its unique light taste and colour'. It con to run because his brother Mohan Singh Bist ran it. It collapsed only after his death in 1977.Hindustan Times, 17 September 2014, \\"U'khand tea: Raj days' flavour goes brandless\\" ==Early life and business activities== Dan Singh Bisht was born in Pithoragarh district, Wadda, in 1906. His father had opened a small shop selling ghee in an insignificant town bordering Nepal. The river Kali is the boundary and the town is called Jhulaghat, literally rope bridge area. Dan Singh's father had immigrated from Western Nepal Baitadi district and Dan Singh retained his Nepalese citizenship until Indian Independence. Aged 12, he left his studies to work as an apprentice with a British timber contractor in Burma, Maymyo then part of British India. It was here he learned the economics of the timber trade, and more importantly how to dress and talk like a 'sahib'. These skills would be leveraged to create a monopoly. When Bisht returned from Burma, his father had just taken the biggest gamble of his life. On 19 September 1919, his father Deb Singh Bisht, a small-time shopkeeper from Jhulaghat, took out a loan to buy of Chaukori estate from a British company. It was this daring that Dan Singh later sought to immortalise in the resolute bronze statue of Deb Singh Bisht that stares out at young students in a bid to inspire them. Dan Singh not only managed to purchase the Berinag estate adjacent, from Captain James Corbett but found the secret ingredient that had enabled the Chinese to outcompete Indian teas in next door Lhasa. His manager located a herb that the Chinese used to add which contributed to its rich colour and flavour. The secret ingredient greatly improve Bisht's position. On 20 May 1924, at the age of 18 years, he purchased a brewery from the British Indian Corporation Limited and on those began to build a home and office for him and his father at Bisht Estate. Berinag tea became the number one brand in the Chinese, London and Indian markets. Bisht managed to get financial support from the Tea Board Association, Calcutta, something both Corbett and the previous owner, Robert Bellairs' father from whom Corbett had bought Berinag. had failed to do. Bisht worked in the hardest of terrain, upstream rivers, and used waterways and rope bridges to transport the timber. From Kisnai to Mendipathar he built a short-cut which is locally called the 'Bisht Road' to ease transportation. It is a dirt track now. it was here, in the Garo Hills, that he encountered a matriarchal society where the women inherit the property which is distinctly at odds with his patriarchal 'Thakur' way of being. This gave him that perhaps at least one or more of his seven daughters would contain the seed that could salvage the empire. He knew the question of succession was his Achilles' heel. This set him to work on the purchase of Smuggler's Rock Estate, to donate the land and building for the first girl's hostel at DSB college. ==Philanthropy== In 1947, Bisht founded Sri Sarswati Deb Singh Higher Secondary School, Pithoragarh. It was named after his parents and was the first higher secondary school in the area, providing education up to A level. He provided the land, buildings, furniture and seed money. In 1949, Bisht created the Srimati Saraswati Bisht Scholarship Endowment trust (SSBSE) to provide scholarships to children of Pithoragarh residents who had been killed in action in World War I and to deserving students of the secondary school. Bisht bought the Wellesley Girls' School in Nainital, added more buildings to it and converted it into DBS College in 1951. THe first post-A level educational institute in the area, it is now the DSB Campus College of Kumaon University, which was founded in 1973 by the incorporation of Dev Singh Bisht (DSB) Government College (commonly called \\"the Degree College\\"). The college was set up by the purchase of of land and building valued at about 1.5 million rupees at a time when the rupee was at parity with the pound, and 50000/- (Half a million) rupees for initial running expenses and salary. This was clearly documented in the recollections J.M. Clay's book on Nainital who was the Deputy Commissioner of Nainital in 1927 as well as in 'Nainital, the land of trumpet and song' by G. Shah in 1999, as well as by Professor Ajay Singh Rawat. Bisht chose the mathematician Dr. A.N. Singh as its first principal and set up a scholarship for needy students called 'Thakur Dan Singh Bisht Scholarship' and it is still utilized today. Noted environmentalist and senior Professor of Kumaun University Professor Ajay Singh Rawat has called Dan Singh Bisht \\"The Pioneer of Higher Education in Uttrakhand\\" in his book Nainital Beckons and also in the journal Udaan for Uttrakhand Open University where he was the Chief editor. He says it seems that now \\"Even Kumaon University which could not have come into existence without the DSB Campus does not remember him. It is our duty to pay homage to him and to his contribution to society and for his visionary and philanthropic spirit so that posterity also remembers him\\". Dan Singh Bisht, a pioneer of the entrepreneur philanthropist in modern India. During 1920–25, Bisht lobbied Maurice Garnier Hallett, who was the Governor of the United Provinces, for an all-weather road from rail head Tanakpur to Pithoragarh. Almost a 100 years later, it remains Pithoragarh's only lifeline to the train station. Once his proposal passed, the road increased trade, commerce, tourism, and strategic resources a gift that continues till this day. Hallett summoned Bisht in connection with his clandestine funding of the freedom movement. Dan Singh Bisht managed to talk himself out of this harrowing moment for his empire. This story is not documented anywhere, but it was told in 1963 to his 26-year- old son in law, Surendra Singh who would later go on to become the Cabinet Secretary of India. Other Philanthropy in his childhood haunts The first three-story Dharamshala or rest house for pilgrims those who follow 'Dharam' was built by him in memory of his grandfather Rai Singh Bisht. Additional medical help was given to many in Berinag with financial help to hospitals and patients. A civil veterinary hospital in Berinag was donated on 28 October 1961, a little over of land and buildings. This is documented in a registered land records patwari office of Berinag. of prime land was donated in Berinag in his brother's name for a college, as well as a school a playground a hospital, and for various governmental offices, including the ethereal Forest Rest house in Berinag. Drinking water in the village of his forefathers in Kuintarh, various dispensaries in Berinag, and the tales of the innumerable people whose education he paid for either because of need, or merit, is part of Kumaoni folklore. The whole town of Berinag is unique for in that every single public amenity from schools, to hospitals, playgrounds, parks, charitable centres, dispensaries, are all donations of D S Bisht and Sons. ==Personal life== Bisht was a benefactor member of the Nainital Boat House Club. He had three wives, as was permitted before the Hindu Marriage Act, and seven daughters who were all young when he died on 10 September 1964. Their youthfulness enabled managers and advisors to gain control, and the empire of sugar mills, tea gardens, and timber, collapsed. ==References== Category:Businesspeople from Uttarakhand Category:Indian philanthropists Category:1906 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Pithoragarh district Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Dan Singh Bisht"},{"id":"46396413","text":"The Thirlmere Roosters Rugby League Football Club is an Australian rugby league football club based in Thirlmere, New South Wales, formed in 1976.

Eia or Eye was an early Medieval manor in the parish of Westminster, Middlesex and is now a part of Central London It was about one mile west of the Palace of Westminster/Whitehall, about 2 miles west-south-west of the walled City of London, and about half a mile north of the River Thames. A smaller sub-manor called Ebury or Eybury, containing the hamlet Eye Cross, was originally part of the manor (and are derivations in name). Ebury and a corruption of it, Avery,Girling, Brian; 2013, Belgravia & Knightsbridge Through Time, Stroud, Glouc., Amberley Publishing Limited, p. 62. appear as modern streets and other places. Today, the area of the manor includes much of Hyde Park (which dates from 1536), the grounds of Buckingham Palace (1703), Belgravia, a country road known later as Park Lane and most parts of Mayfair, Pimlico, and Knightsbridge. (Together these form much of the western part of the SW1 postcode area), The name Eia is believed to have originated as a Latinisation of the Anglo-Saxon word īeg, which means \\"island\\",J. E. B. Gover, 1922, The Place Names of Middlesex, London, Longmans, p. 22. in reference to a rise along a stream/marsh, and from maps seems to refer to a former, perhaps only discernible after heavy rains, island above one which surrounded Westminster Abbey, Thorney Island, drained and formed by the River Tyburn. ==Middle Ages== Eia was a rural manor during the early medieval period, on land adjacent to the River Tyburn (a reduced catchment form of which flows beneath the courtyard and south wing of Buckingham Palace), immediately west and north of Thorney Island, on the Thames, which became the site of Westminster Abbey.O. G. Goring, (1937). From Goring House to Buckingham Palace. London: Ivor Nicholson & Watson, p.15Patricia Wright, 2012, The Strange History of Buckingham Palace, Stroud, Gloucs., The History Press, p. 160. Ownership of the site changed hands many times in the Middle Ages. Its owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times. After the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.,F. H. W. Sheppard, \\"The Acquisition of the Estate\\", Survey of London 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), London, London County Council, pp. 1–5 (12 April 2015). At about the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, the manor of Eia was divided into three smaller manors: Hyde (the north-western part), Ebury (or Eyebury/Eia) (central area) and La Neyte or Neat (to the south-east). Neyte was a small island in the marsh (in what is now Pimlico), on which a house was built for the Abbot of Westminster.Wright, p. 160. Neyte may been the inspiration of Knightsbridge, considerably beyond the north side, which centred on a bridge over water on one of the great, Roman-founded, roads leading west-south-west from the City of London. By the 12th century a ford crossing on the River Tyburn, before its loss known as Cow Ford, was the site of a hamlet: Eye Cross. Its location is unknown; probably it was in and/or beside the south of Buckingham Palace Gardens.Wright, 2012, p. 40. ==Early modern era== In 1531 King Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James (later St. James's Palace)Goring, p. 28 from Eton College, a royal foundation founded in 1440 by King Henry VI endowed with many royal lands. In 1536 on the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Manor of Ebury became one of the many possessions of Westminster Abbey which reverted to the Crown (which is considered the foundation of all land ownership)Goring, p. 18 and the Court of Augmentations. This meant the site that would become Buckingham Palace returned to royal ownership, almost 500 years after William the Conqueror had given it away.Sheppard, 1977 By the early 17th century, the lease of the manor had passed through the hands of many different people. Eye Cross had ceased to exist and the area of the former village was mostly wasteland.Wright, pp. 76–8 During the reign of King James I (1603-1625), part of it was sold, freehold, (including the future site of Buckingham Palace). On the rest James established a mulberry garden (near the north-west corner of the present palace).Goring, pp. 31–36 Before 1650 Clement Walker, in his work Anarchia Anglicana, referred to \\"new-erected sodoms and spintries\\" – both terms referring to male prostitution – in \\"the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\\". Development During the late 17th century Ebury's freehold passed from Sir Hugh Audley to his great-great-niece Mary Davies. Audley and Davies were key figures in the development of Ebury Manor into a suburb of the City of London, now comprising Mayfair, Belgravia and Park Lane. They are commemorated by today's North Audley Street, South Audley Street and Davies Street, all in Mayfair. Much of Mary's inheritance now forms part of the Grosvenor Estate. thumb220pxBuckingham House, the core element of today's Buckingham Palace, was built in the 1700s by John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby to the design of William Winde façade; originally built to the design of Edward Blore and completed in 1850. It acquired its present appearance following a 1913 remodelling by Sir Aston Webb Buckingham House, the mansion that now forms the core of Buckingham Palace, was built in 1703 by John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby to the design of William Winde.Harris, p.22 In 1761 the mansion returned to the ownership of the royal family (which had retained the adjoining site of the Mulberry Garden), when it was sold to King George III,John Martin Robinson, 1999, Buckingham Palace, London , The Royal Collection, p. 14. for either £21,000Roy Nash, 1980, Buckingham Palace: The Place and the People, London, Macdonald Futura., p. 18 or, possibly, £28,000.Wright, p. 142. ==Ebury in modern place and other names== Ebury Street, Belgravia. This part of the street has been renamed Mozart Terrace after the composer Wolfgang Mozart, who in 1764 stayed at the house to the left of the lamp post and composed his first symphony there. Ebury survives as a place name in: Ebury Street, Belgravia, Ebury Square, Ebury Wharf and Ebury Bridge, which crosses the former Grosvenor Canal. The name Avery, also found in many street names in SW1, is a corruption of Ebury.Girling, p. 62. The modern hereditary title Baron Ebury, was created in 1857 for Robert Grosvenor, the owner of the estate, of an ancient and prominent gentry family of Cheshire. The names of some of the family's Cheshire estates now feature as street names in the former manor of Ebury, most notably Eaton, Belgrave and Eccleston. One of Grosvenor's business enterprises was the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway, also known as the \\"Ebury Line\\", in Hertfordshire. The railway no longer exists and has been converted into the Ebury Way hiking trail. Ebury Publishing has its offices in Pimlico. ==FootnotesBibliography== * Charles T.

Neither side could gain an advantage in the battle and, in the end, only three soldiers of the 600 survived the battle: Orthyades, for the Spartans, and Alcenor and Chromius, for the Argives. After the battle, the two surviving Argives left the field to report their victory. Orthyades, on the other hand, remained and looted the bodies of the fallen Argives (as was customary). The following day, the Spartan and Argive army returned to see who had been victorious, but each side claimed victory: the Argives because more Argives had survived and the Spartans because the Argives had retreated. The disagreement resulted in general fighting between the armies and in which the Spartans were the victors. Othryades, ashamed to return to Sparta as the sole survivor of the 300, committed suicide on the battlefield. ==In art== *Othryades the Spartan, Dying, is a sculpture by Johan Tobias Sergel in the Louvre's Northern European Sculpture Collection. *Dying Othryades is a sculpture by David d'Angers at the Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers. ==In literature== *Ovid mentions Othryades in Fasti II.663. ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Ancient Spartan soldiers Category:Sole survivors Category:Ancient Greeks who committed suicide Category:Male suicides ","title":"Othryades"},{"id":"46396478","text":"Fastlane was a professional wrestling pay-per-view and WWE Network event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticut–based promotion, and broadcast live and available through pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network.

As a SaaS, services of SeatID are provided for websites through subscription plans that are categorised according to the number of visitors served by the website as well as the number of features available for use. SeatID incorporates social media experiences in ticketing, booking and reservation websites as well as applications. This can be achieved by SeatID bringing in information from social media sites and displaying them on websites that have employed their services. Such information includes the list of the customer’s friends, colleagues or family members who have purchased the product or service that the customer is currently browsing. These information serves as a reference for customers and may aid some of them in making purchase decisions. Many websites and mobile apps of hotels, train operators, online ticket retailers and airlines have employed the services of SeatID to serve their millions of users every month. == Background == Founding SeatID was founded back in December 2011 by Founder Sani Sanilevich and Co- founders Eran Savir and David Rachamim. Eran Savir served as CEO since 2011 to present while David Rachamim served as CTO since March 2012 to present. An interview with Co-Founder Eran Savir revealed how the idea of SeatID came about. As SeatID’s founder Sani Sanilevich recalled his flight experiences one day, it generated in him the idea that by creating a tool that allows passengers to choose their seatmates, it would probably help to enhance their flight experience. They then began to come up with possible ideas and gathered feedbacks from several airline companies. Funding SeatID is backed by investors from USA, Europe, Russia and Israel. To date, the company has received a total of $1 million fundings from its investors. == Technology == SeatID is a SaaS cloud based solution that can be integrated with websites to provide users with additional information that may be useful for them. It only takes a couple of minutes to set up SeatID because the implementation of social elements, such as copying and pasting of codes on the websites are simple and quick. With the implementation of Social Login, Social Proof and Social Seating, companies can add social experience to their websites or apps that substantially improve customers' confidence and users' experience. Currently, SeatID supports logins through various social networks namely, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google+. There will also be addition of other social networks in future. ==Functions of SeatID and Privacy concerns== SeatID is an opt-in system. When browsing a website that incorporates SeatID, only those users who have opt for the service will be presented with the additional information from social networking sites. At the same time, their information may also be seen by other users. Such services may be useful but also tend to generate users' privacy concerns. For SeatID, users have the ability to customise settings and decide on the amount of information that they wish to make visible to other users. Furthermore, they can also select and limit the viewers who can see their information. == Industries == SeatID currently supports 5 industries which include Travel, Hotel, Online ticket sellers, Trains and Stadiums. While the service provided by SeatID is similar in the industries, it caters to the needs of individuals seeking different purposes. Travel For the travel industry, airlines may add SeatID as a widget to their company's website and users will be able to find out information of other passengers and their seating location on a certain flight. This provides convenience for personal and corporate trips. Hotels Hotels that added SeatID as a widget would be able to display to customers the list of people on their social networks who were previous customers. This can help customers when making purchase decisions because people tend to trust the hotel’s services if people whom they trust were visitors previously. SeatID is used by hotels of different countries, including United Kingdom, Italy, Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia. Online Ticket Sellers With SeatID, customers would be able to find out who on their social networks have purchased tickets for a certain event and where is their seating location. These information helps customers in making their decision as they can choose to sit with their friends if they decide to attend a certain event. Trains Similar to SeatID for Travel, SeatID for Trains provides customers with some information of passengers on board obtained from their social networking sites. This aids customers in choosing their seatmate and seat. Stadiums Lastly, SeatID for Stadiums allows customers to choose areas with audience of similar interests. This is especially useful when it comes to sports events where audience supporting the same teams can get together and support the team. For concerts involving more than one artist, fans supporting a particular artist can also gather at one area. == References  External links == * Category:Online companies of Israel ","title":"SeatID"},{"id":"46396743","text":"Alessia Mosca (born 23 May 1975) is an Italian politician who has been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) since 2014. ==Early life and education== Born in Monza, Mosca graduated in philosophy at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, and earned a master's degree in diplomacy at the Johns Hopkins University (American University based in Florence) and a PhD in Political Science at the University of Florence.

Hugo Duarte was born on August 8, 1968. He was a protege of Marco Ruas. Holding a mixed record, Hugo is best known for his bizarre fight with Mark Kerr, where he completely refused to engage, and faked injuries to continually force the referee to pause the match. == Early Years Luta Livre == Hugo Duarte is also famous for his beach fight in Rio against Rickson Gracie. Hugo Duarte at the age of 20, was famously confronted by Rickson Gracie and his friends at Pepe beach in Brazil in 1988. Rickson arrived with 50 followers to the beach. This crowd included Rodrigo Vaghi and Renzo Gracie. Rickson was 30 at the time was offered a hand shake by Duarte. Rickson proceeded to slap Hugo in the face and a fight started. There were allegations that Rickson threw sand into Hugo's face. Other allegations were that jiujitsu practitioners were kicking Duarte during the fight. After the fight, Hugo Duarte went to the Gracie Academy with a number of people to confront Rickson. The result was the same with Rickson winning this time in a parking lot. They would have disdain for each other for years. The fight was taped by a few individuals including a tourist. The Gracie family would go on to market the taping of this event in their self-defense videos. The video of the fight was edited and made to show that Rickson Gracie dominated the fight, which included Duarte's knees to Rickson's body. The tape was especially used in America. Hugo would go on to coach the likes of Eugenio Tadeu. ==Mixed Martial Arts == He competed in the Heavyweight division. Hugo, Johil de Oliveira, and Eugenio Tadeu are amongst the most notable representatives of the Luta Livre style that was famous for opposing against Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the Vale Tudo events held in Brazil. Hugo had the reputation as one of the best Brazilian heavy weight fighters during his fighting era. One of his two most recognized matches was in the UFC against Tank Abbot where he lost by some heavy punches to the head region in 43 seconds, and which was refereed by Big John McCarthy. The second was in PRIDE against Mark Kerr where he stated in an interview that he had gassed out and suffered a broken foot via foot stomp from Mark Kerr. Duarte would leave the ring any time the fighters were about to engage. and his corner would throw in the towel with the fight ruled a TKO. He lost his last fight at 2H2H 1 - 2 Hot 2 Handle against Bob Schrijber on March 5, 2000. Duarte is considered to be an MMA bust despite his record.

Brazilian freestyle fighting) and also Luta, Brazilian Catch Wrestling or Luta Livre Submission, is a Brazilian martial art created by Euclydes Hatem in Rio de Janeiro. Primarily a mixture of catch wrestling and judo, there is also striking with the hands, feet, knees and elbows. Notable practitioners include Marco Ruas, Ebenezer Fontes Braga, Johil de Oliveira, Alexandre Franca Nogueira, Renato Sobral, Gesias Cavalcante, Darren Till and José Aldo. There are two styles: esportiva (\\"sporting\\") and vale tudo (\\"anything goes\\"); both styles are no-gi. In esportiva competitions, grappling techniques are the only techniques allowed to subdue the opponent. Consequently, it is important to calmly strategize and execute moves with the aim to force the opponent to submit via armlock, leglock, choke or necklock, or to win by points (i.e. takedowns, domination position). Punches, kicks and other \\"hard\\" techniques are not allowed as this is considered more a sport than actual combat. Vale tudo, on the other hand, includes techniques in the clinch as well as on the ground; punches and kicks are allowed, but the ground fight and submissions are still the largest elements. This is also the form used in MMA-style fights. ==History== Luta Livre's founder is credited to be Euclydes \\"Tatu\\" Hatem, who was originally a catch wrestler. Euclydes Hatem went by the name of Tatu. He began teaching catch wrestling techniques to others in Rio de Janeiro in 1927 while experimenting with some of his own innovative techniques. Tatu brought on many challenges with the Brazilian Jiujitsu and culminated with his victory over George Gracie in the Catch rules fight. The style emphasized fighting without a gi/uniform. He received popularity when he submitted George Gracie in 1940 and when one of his students, Euclides Pereira defeated Carlson Gracie in 1968. The system focused on ground fighting and submissions due to their importance in Vale Tudo matches. The ground fighting included the use of leg locks, which at the time was ignored by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. For years, Luta Livre was extremely popular in Brazil, second only to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Some of the famous fighters that came out of Luta Livre included William Porfirio. In the 1970s Luta Livre was strongly influenced by father and son duo Fausto and Carlos Brunocilla. The Brunocilla were Tatu's pupils and were in turn responsible for graduating many Luta Livre Masters. Also around the 1970s, the art of Luta Livre was influenced by Roberto Leitão, a practitioner of judo and wrestling. Leitao also articulated the \\"Theory of Grappling\\", sometimes referred to as \\"Theory of Luta Livre\\". Roberto Leitao was a University professor of Engineering who had devoted many years to Wrestling and Judo. ==Ranking== The grading system, according to the Wrestling Federation Submission of the State of Rio de Janeiro, is divided into three: beginners, intermediate and advanced. Beginners *White *Yellow *Orange Intermediate *Blue Advanced *Purple *Brown *Black ==Luta Livre and Brazilian jiu-jitsu== Luta Livre, in its early days, was largely considered to be an art \\"for poor kids who could not afford a gi.\\" due to appearances since they didn't fight with a gi. Luta Livre and BJJ were considered to be enemies. When Euclides Perreria beat Carlson Gracie in 1968 , the rivalry was continued for a few more decades. It was actually very popular amongst kids from the favelas. Luta Livre focused on teaching the poor who were primarily of African descent. This was opposed to Brazilian Jiujitsu which was thought to focus on teaching of the upper class, who were primarily light skinned. The battles between the two arts was essentially a class warfare. By the 1980s, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu had become very popular in Brazil and Luta Livre representatives wanted to help popularize their art by accepting challenges from Brazilian jiu-jitsu champions in Vale Tudo and Submission matches. Luta Livre continued on with many famous fights in and out of the ring. This included a fight with Rickson Gracie on the beaches of Brazil. This would hurt Luta Livre's reputation with Hugo Duarte losing to Rickson Gracie then getting knocked out by Tank Abbott at UFC 17 and Eugenio Tadeu losing to Wallid Ismael due to his inability to re-enter the ring in time. Tadeu did battle Royler Gracie to a draw in an indoor fight. Another fight between Renzo Gracie and Eugenio Tadeu kept the rivalry going. His battle with Renzo Gracie in 1997 ended in a No Contest due to fans rioting. In 1991 Desafio hosted a Jiu-Jitsu vs Luta Livre card that had three representatives of Brazilian jiu-jitsu up against three representatives of Luta Livre, with BJJ winning all three fights. One fighter Marco Ruas, who would later become a UFC champ, had a huge rivalry with Rickson Gracie. A fight though never occurred between the two fighters. When MMA became popularized and after BJJ having such success against Luta Livre practitioners in the more popular MMA fights, more Luta Livre practitioners left their original camps and went instead to the Jiu-Jitsu camps hoping for success in a fighting career. Hugo, Johil De Oliveira, and Eugenio Tadeau are amongst the most notable representatives of that era for the Luta Livre style that was famous for opposing against Brazilian Jiu-jitsu in the Vale Tudo events held in Brazil. Despite their overall losses against Jiu-Jitsu, Luta Livre seems to be making a resurgence in mixed martial arts. ==See also== *Lucha Libre ==References * Renovação Fight Team Deutschland (Germany) * Complete History of Luta Livre *International Luta Livre (Esportiva-Vale Tudo) Federation *Federação de Luta-Livre Submission do Estado do Rio de Janeiro *European Luta Livre (Esportiva-Vale Tudo) Federation Category:Brazilian martial arts Category:Sports originating in Brazil Category:Mixed martial arts styles category:Combat sports ","title":"Luta Livre"},{"id":"46396982","text":"Plinthograptis rhytisma is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

He spent his life promoting music. The University of Durham, where he once studied and taught, called him one of \\"Britain's most influential musicians during the first half of the twentieth century\\". An autodidact, he was a prodigious creator of Gebrauchsmusik. ==Early life and education in Newcastle== St George's Church and Green in Jesmond, where Whittaker played the organ as a schoolboy Whittaker was born into a Methodist family in the Shieldfield district of Newcastle upon Tyne. His father, John Whittaker, the illegitimate son of a farm labourer's daughter, came from Little Corby in Cumberland. His mother, Ellen Gillies, was an orphan from a respected family in Hexham in Northumberland. From an early age Whittaker showed an interest in music: he learnt to play the flute and his father bought him a piccolo; and he played as a schoolboy organist at St George's Presbyterian Church in Jesmond. His father encouraged him to follow a career in science, which led to Whittaker initially studying mathematics—without great success—at Armstrong College, at that time part of the University of Durham (it later formed the nucleus of the present- day University of Newcastle upon Tyne). Subsequently, he resumed organ and singing lessons, obtaining performing and teaching qualifications from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music; and, from 1898, he commenced studies in musicology at the University of Durham. After graduating he continued at Armstrong College; he had successive appointments as instructor, lecturer and reader in music; and he embarked on a doctorate in 1902, submitting a dissertation in 1909, although he had to wait until 1921 for the degree to be awarded. He also worked as a music master at two of the main girls' schools in Newcastle, teaching singing at the Central Newcastle High School in Jesmond and Rutherford Girls' School at Rye Hill (which opened in 1907 in former buildings of the Royal Grammar School). In 1903 Whittaker married Clara Watkins, an amateur musician from Gateshead and the daughter of a South Shields ship owner. Together they had two daughters, Clarrie and Mary, brought up as strict vegetarians with an equally strict regime of pre- breakfast instrumental practise on the cello and the violin. ==Choir work on Tyneside== The Literary and Philosophical Society in the centre of Newcastle, where Whittaker frequently attended and gave lectures300px Whittaker conducted several choirs on Tyneside, working with the Newcastle Choral Union, Newcastle Bach Choir, the Whitley Bay Choral Society, the Tynemouth Choral Society and the Gateshead Choral Union. With these ensembles, he achieved excellent results. He also knew many composers of the period, with Gustav Holst amongst his friends; and he met Maurice Ravel on a visit to Newcastle, during which Ravel accompanied his newly composed song cycle Histoires Naturelles and attended a rehearsal of his own string quartet. Whittaker's mentor Charles Sanford Terry, who was at the University of Durham before taking up a post at the University of Aberdeen, encouraged Whittaker's enthusiasm for J.S. Bach, particularly his choral music. Whittaker performed all of Bach's cantatas during his career. He founded the Newcastle Bach Choir in 1915, based in Newcastle Cathedral. One of the members of the choir, Basil Bunting, recalled that he was \\"not only learned but also showed [a] great sense of music and art in general\\". With the Newcastle Bach Choir, he made a concert tour to London and participated in a three-day festival in 1922. He performed the first complete version of the Great English Service of William Byrd in Newcastle upon Tyne, and performed it again at St. Margaret's Church in Westminster in 1924. From 1925 onwards he served on three musical advisory committees of the BBC. ==Appointment in Glasgow== Letter of congratulations from Gustav Holst on Whittaker's appointment in Glasgow In 1929, finding musical opportunities in the North East of England too restrictive, Whittaker moved to Glasgow, where he took up a newly endowed joint position as Principal of the Scottish National Academy of Music (RSAMD) (1929–1941) and Gardiner Professor of Music at the University of Glasgow (1929–1941). In making the move, Whittaker left his wife Clara, who subsequently moved to London to join their daughter Mary. Whittaker himself was accompanied North of the border by his former student Annie Lawton, with whom he set up house. Once installed in Scotland, he received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow and an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh, where his friend Donald Tovey was professor of music. Tovey, a member of the governing board of the Academy, wrote to Whittaker that he hoped the award might be \\"of some slight value for strengthening your hand for a task that you cannot execute without overcoming some opposition.\\" The task was to transform what had previously been the Athenaeum School into a musical academy similar to the colleges in London; but despite, grants from the local benefactor Daniel Macaulay Stevenson, there were insufficient funds to finance musical scholarships, attract teachers, build up a library and hold concerts. Whittaker was disappointed by musical life in Glasgow, which he later stated to be \\"even more provincial\\" than in Newcastle. He was frustrated that his attempts to improve matters were constantly opposed by governors during his tenure as Principal: it was \\"a heart-breaking struggle against impossible odds.\\" ==Legacy in Glasgow== Former Belmont Parish Church, Great George Street, Hillhead, where Whittaker conducted the last concert of the Bach Cantata Choir in Byrd's Great Service and Bach's Motet \\"Sing ye to the Lord\\" on 29 March 1941 Despite the difficulties he encountered, Whittaker nevertheless found a kindred spirit and friend in the main professor of pianoforte Philip Halstead, whom he described as a \\"splendid all-round musician\\"; and was given unpaid support by Harold Thomson, a former student at the Academy who became a close friend. Assisted by them and others, he succeeded in setting up a three-year Diploma course. Somewhat unexpectedly he also discovered that the local Glasgow Bach Choir had performed very few of Bach's cantatas; they willingly agreed to become part of Whittaker's new Bach Cantata Choir which performed in Stevenson Hall, the newly built concert hall of the Academy. As a result, Whittaker was able to realise his lifelong ambition of performing all of Bach's cantatas: he performed one third of them in Newcastle and the remaining two thirds in Glasgow. He later described his activities with the Bach Cantata Choir as the \\"chief joy\\" of his period in Glasgow. Other activities in the concert hall included \\"Opera Week\\" for operas, oratorios and incidental music, including works of Purcell, Handel, Bach, Gluck, Mozart and Schubert; some governors of the Academy attempted unsuccessfully to have these performances stopped as \\"profligate\\", their preference being for Gilbert and Sullivan and Offenbach. Whittaker succeeded in raising funds from the Carnegie Foundation for a library, now the Whittaker Library in the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland; and also set up a museum of ancient instruments in the Academy and an archive of musical manuscripts, now the Whittaker Collection, in the university. ==Retirement and death== Among the Northumbrian Hills, title page, 1922 Whittaker had briefly resigned from the Academy in 1938, when, on returning from a trip to Sweden, he discovered that the governors had reversed some of his decisions during his absence. When it transpired that the Academy could not run smoothly without him, he acceded to a request from the Vice Chancellor of the University to return to his post. On his retirement in 1941, he was made an emeritus professor in the university. Despite ill health, he agreed to join ENSA, under the leadership of Walter Legge and Basil Dean, to help in the running of wartime classical music events. This involved giving lectures around the country, organising concerts, adjudicating competitions and preparing boxes of records for concerts. On a trip to act as judge at a Services Festival in the Orkney Islands in July 1944, he died of heart failure in his sleep. In his will he bequeathed a copy of a bronze sculpture that Jacob Epstein had made of him in 1942 to King's College in Newcastle. ==Publications== Whittaker's main expertise as performer and scholar lay in the cantatas of J.S.Bach. Whittaker's book on the subject was published posthumously by Oxford University Press in 1959 in two volumes, which Harold Thompson prepared for publication from a typed draft. In a later edition of 1978 an appendix was added to correct chronological details which only became known in the 1950s. Whittaker also promoted musicians like Gustav Holst, Vaughan Williams, Debussy, Satie, and Poulenc. In addition to Bach scholarship, he acted as a publisher and editor of music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Among his works are A Lyke-Wake Dirge for chorus and orchestra (1925), and Among the Northumbrian Hills, free variations on an original theme for piano and string quartet (1922), both of which were published as part of the Carnegie Collection of British Music. Other works include The Celestial Sphere for chorus and orchestra, and Psalm CXXXIX. He also had a strong interest in folk music from his native Tyneside and Northumberland, championing the Northumbrian smallpipes; he published arrangements of folk songs, including choral versions of the \\"Keel Row\\", \\"Bobby Shaftoe\\", \\"Blow the Wind Southerly\\" and \\"Water of Tyne\\". ==NotesReferences== * * ==External links== *Poster for Centenary Concert of Newcastle Bach Choir, founded by Whittaker.

He was the third son of Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont and Alicia Maria, daughter of the 2nd Baron Carpenter, and brother of Hon. Percy Charles Wyndham. He was educated at Westminster School from 1767 to 1775, and in 1801 he married Lady Anna Barbara Frances Child Villiers, daughter of the 4th Earl of Jersey and widow of William Henry Lambton of Lambton, County Durham. They had no children. According to some, he \\"proposed marriage to a gentlewoman one day, married her the next and parted from her the day after\\" so offspring would have been unlikely. At the 1790 general election Charles and his older brother Percy were returned as the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Midhurst, a pocket borough in West Sussex which had recently been purchased by their oldest brother George, the 3rd Earl of Egremont. Wyndham gave up the Midhurst seat in 1795, shortly before his brother sold it, in order to sit for New Shoreham. He held that seat until 1802, when his brother persuaded him to stand for the county seat of Sussex. He held that seat until he stood down in 1812. == Scandal == Wyndham was the defendant in a notorious 'criminal conversation' (adultery) case, brought by Anthony Hodges, regarding his wife Anna Sophia Hodges nee Acton. Hodges claimed he had been long separated from his wife on suspicion of her adultery, after which point she became pregnant. During the trial, which happened in Westminster in February 1791 before Lord Kenyon, Mrs Hodges was confirmed to be pregnant and living with the defendant. However it was argued that the plaintiff had not only known about the affair, but had prostituted his wife to a Mr Bouvier, and the Prince of Wales (later George IV) as early as 1784. The jury returned a verdict in favour of the defendant.Trial for adultery, between Anthony Hodges, Esq. and the Hon. Charles Wyndham; tried before the Right Hon.

It was released by Ancient B Records on 29 June 2015 and has been described as \\"an album from an artist over the hump, head high to the future and all engines gunning\\". == Background ==  Writing and recording  Writing for Love Amongst Ruin's second album began midway through the tour supporting their self-titled debut album in January 2011. Just prior to the end of the tour the following June, frontman Steve Hewitt revealed that the band had written nine songs and planned to begin recording in September 2011. In November, Hewitt revealed that the band had been recording at Moles Studio in Bath, the location of the majority of recording for the band's debut album. Writing was completed in March 2012 and recordings continued at Moles Studio, with Hewitt and guitarists Donald Ross Skinner and Steve Hove handling playing duties, with Paul Corkett engineering. Corkett later put Hewitt and Skinner in touch with producer Dan Austin, a frequent production partner of Gil Norton. Austin was given a trial run at producing the title track, which he \\"nailed\\" and was asked to produce the whole album. The entire process was completed in two-and-a-half months. Perry Bamonte featured on bass on the album after being announced as having joined the band in September 2012. Early composition \\"Oh God\\" was recorded for the album, after having been performed live at the London Scala in June 2010 and prepared for an EP in 2012, which failed to see release. A cover of Six by Seven's \\"So Close\\" was recorded for the album, prior to Hewitt joining the said band in 2013. Despite initially not wishing to record a cover, Hewitt and Austin felt the track fitted the vibe of the album and set out \\"to make it the song it never really was\\". Former member Laurie Ross returned to provide cello and programming for the album. Hewitt recalled that the troublesome vocal melody for \\"Menace Ballad\\" was completed by local Bath musician Nick Walker.  Musical style and influences  The album has been described as containing rock noir, psychedelic, experimental post-rock and ethereal influences.  Themes  Of the album's title and title track, Hewitt said \\"it’s how your perceptions change as you go through life. Do you actually know where you’re fucking going? It’s trying to explain life’s difficult path\\". Hewitt also revealed that he consciously made a decision to write about experiences outside the personal nature prevalent on the debut album, saying \\"it's a difficult thing to do and a huge departure mentally and it's something I find exciting. There are still personal songs on the record, but it's more about the human condition rather than what's being inflicted by others\\". Closing track \\"Oh God\\" was written by Hewitt as a reaction to the shock of hearing the news of the death of his friend Stuart Cable in 2010. \\"Modern War Song\\" deals with the subject of Western imperialism and how \\"revolting soldiers are treated when their service finishes after signing up and fighting for their country\\". Hewitt revealed that there isn't a constant theme running through the album, instead \\"the album is more of a soundscape\\".  Delay and release  Lose Your Way was put on the back burner after guitarist Steve Hove quit the band shortly before a comeback show at the London Barfly on 10 September 2012. Hewitt subsequently joined Six by Seven for its Love and Peace and Sympathy album and tour in 2013 and produced records by former Love Amongst Ruin opening bands Lys and Spiral 69. The Lose Your Way album title and track list were revealed in April 2015, with a release date of 29 June 2015. The release of the album was preceded by the \\"Lose Your Way\\" EP on 11 May 2015 and was followed by the \\"Modern War Song\\" and \\"So Close\\" EPs respectively on 24 July and 6 November. ==Reception== NME gave the album 7/10, saying that the album was \\"lovely, but ruinous\\". Cryptic Rock gave the album full marks and said Hewitt had achieved a \\"smorgasbord\\" and \\"cornucopia of sound\\". Kerrang! awarded the album 4/5, saying Hewitt's ejection from Placebo \\"may well have been a blessing in disguise\\". ==Track listing== iTunes bonus tracks == Personnel == * Steve Hewitt – vocals, drums, bass, guitar, piano * Donald Ross Skinner – guitar, bass, keyboards * Steve Hove – guitar * Laurie Ross – cello, programming * Beth Porter – cello * James SK Wān – glockenspiel * Perry Bamonte – bass == Production == * Production, engineering – Dan Austin * Additional engineering – Paul Corkett * Mixing – Dan Austin, Steve Hewitt, Donald Ross Skinner * Mastering – Brian Gardner * Additional mastering – Paul Walton ==Tour== Love Amongst Ruin performing in London, November 2015.

Another example is intercepting web traffic and redirecting the user from the secure, HTTPS version of a website to an unencrypted HTTP version. ==Attack== Downgrade attacks are often implemented as part of a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), and may be used as a way of enabling a cryptographic attack that might not be possible otherwise. Downgrade attacks have been a consistent problem with the SSL/TLS family of protocols; examples of such attacks include the POODLE attack. Downgrade attacks in the TLS protocol take many forms. Researchers have classified downgrade attacks with respect to four different vectors, which represents a framework to reason about downgrade attacks as follows: There are some recent proposals that exploit the concept of prior knowledge to enable TLS clients (e.g. web browsers) to protect sensitive domain names against certain types of downgrade attacks that exploit the clients' support for legacy versions or non-recommended ciphersuites (e.g. those that do not support forward secrecy or authenticated encryption) such as the POODLE, ClientHello fragmentation, and a variant of the DROWN (aka \\"the special drown\\") downgrade attacks. Removing backward compatibility is often the only way to prevent downgrade attacks. However, sometimes the client and server can recognize each other as up-to-date in a manner that prevents them. For example, if a Web server and user agent both implement HTTP Strict Transport Security and the user agent knows this of the server (either by having previously accessed it over HTTPS, or because it is on an \\"HSTS preload list\\"), then the user agent will refuse to access the site over vanilla HTTP, even if a malicious router represents it and the server to each other as not being HTTPS-capable. ==References== Category:Backward compatibility Category:Computer network security Category:Cryptographic attacks Category:Transport Layer Security Category:Web security exploits ","title":"Downgrade attack"},{"id":"46397584","text":"Leo Monaghan (22 August 1916 – 23 March 1996) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1916 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from New South Wales Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Fitzroy Football Club players ","title":"Leo Monaghan"},{"id":"46397600","text":"Sanguinograptis obtrecator is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and airs an alternative rock radio format. WINU has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 530 watts. The transmitter is in the Helderberg Mountain antenna farm off Pinnacle Road in the Voorheesville section of New Scotland.Radio-Locator.com/WINU ==Station history== WIZR-FM Johnstown WINU is one of several signals to have moved into the Albany market in recent years. Prior to its move in March 1999, it was licensed to Johnstown, New York as the sister station to AM 930 WIZR. It first signed on the air on June 26, 1968 as WIZR-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-212 At first, it simulcast its AM companion. In 1980, it began broadcasting a live and local Oldies format which lasted until the station went dark in 1982. It returned to the air in 1983 once again simulcasting 930 AM. In early 1984, it got its own call sign as WSRD \\"The Wizard\\" as it switched to a short lived live and local Album Oriented Rock format. It flipped to a satellite delivered adult contemporary format in late 1984 and eventually to satellite delivered oldies in 1987. The Oldies format would remain in place until early 1999. In early 1998, longtime WIZR/WSRD owner Joe Caruso obtained a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit to move WZMR to the Albany suburb of Altamont. That put it in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy media market making the station more valuable. In October 1998, Caruso sold the stations to Albany Broadcasting (today's Pamal Broadcasting) for $2.2 million.www.BizJournals.com \\"Albany Stories\\" Oct. 26, 1998 Albany Broadcasting closed on the stations in March 1999 and quickly moved WSRD into its studios, Moving to Albany The new call letters for the station were WAAP. The transmitter site was initially on the Channel 23 tower with sister station WAJZ, but was later moved to the WYJB tower in November 2000. The format was changed to modern adult contemporary as The Point when it began broadcasting from its new transmitter, on March 10, 1999. The switch to Modern AC was an attempt to capitalize on the then-recent flips of WXLE (now WTMM-FM) to rhythmic oldies, WRVE to a more mainstream format, and the then-stunting WKLI. It was WKLI which spoiled these plans, as Albany Broadcasting was sued by CBS Radio, then-owners of the Point name, on the behalf of WKLI-owner-in-waiting Tele-Media. In response, the station relaunched as WZMR with the Z104.9 branding and a modern rock format. The Point name surfaced on WKLI (which changed to WCPT) that May. However, the ratings were not what Albany Broadcasting had hoped for. Smooth Jazz On October 2, 1999, WHRL (now WGY-FM) switched from smooth jazz to modern rock, Albany Broadcasting took advantage of the format hole. Within two weeks, WZMR flipped to smooth jazz at 6:00 a.m. on October 18, 1999, as \\"Smooth Jazz 104.9.\\" The final song played under WZMR's short-lived modern rock format was \\"You Get What You Give\\" by The New Radicals, also the first song played under the format. Though the return of smooth jazz was initially a success, ratings had declined at the station by early 2003. In June 2003, the format was tweaked to urban adult contemporary (as a complement to then-urban WAJZ). WZMR added R&B; and soul music to the smooth jazz playlist, with the branding 104.9 Love FM. However, the new format failed to attract listeners as well as advertising revenue, and the station was up for sale in 2004 to prepare WNYQ (105.7 FM) for a move-in. However, Regent Communications would eventually buy that station after the sale to Pamal fell through, and Pamal instead retained WZMR. Country and Active Rock After playing Christmas music in December 2004, the format was again changed on January 6, 2005, to a simulcast of country music station WFFG-FM in Corinth, New York. Former WZMR logo under the Edge format, 2006-2010 After a weekend of stunting, WZMR flipped formats to active rock on February 13, 2006 as 104.9 The Edge, picking up the format abandoned by the former Edge, 103.9 WQBK-FM and 103.5 WQBJ in December 2005. WZMR saw the most success during this time, with the station's Edgefest concerts, and brought in John Mulrooney for its morning show. However, with WQBK-FM and WQBJ reverting to their previous active rock format in 2008, and WHRL tweaking from modern rock to active rock one year later, the future of WZMR's active rock format was cloudy. However, by the end of 2010, only WQBK-FM and WQBJ remained with the active rock format in the Albany market. Former WZMR logo as 104.9 The Cat, 2010–2013 At 10:49 a.m. on February 26, 2010, the final song under the Edge format, \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" by Ted Nugent, was anticlimactically interrupted, as WZMR returned to a country music format under the 104.9 The Cat branding, taking on a similar playlist and imaging to co-owned WJEN in Vermont. The first song played under the new country format was \\"Building Bridges\\" by Brooks & Dunn. Adult Alternative and Sports At midnight on October 10, 2013, WZMR began simulcasting on sister station WKLI-FM. The simulcast lasted until December 13, 2013, when, for 24 hours, WZMR began stunting with sound effects of a man hiking. WZMR launched an adult album alternative format at midnight on December 14, 2013, branded as \\"104.9 The Peak.\\" The first song on The Peak was Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. The \\"Peak\\" name is also used by co-owned WXPK in the northern suburbs of New York City.http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/125182/wzmr-albany-s-new-format-triple-a 104.9 flipped to sports talk at midnight on January 12, 2015. The new call letters were WINU with the word \\"win\\" in its moniker, \\"Win 104.9.\\" The last song on \\"The Peak\\" was \\"Be My Wife\\" by David Bowie. The station was silent for four minutes after DJ John Clark signed off until 12 a.m., when it went straight to CBS Sports Radio with the hourly \\"Sports Flash\\" update. The station utilized programming from CBS Sports, picking up that affiliation from AM 1240 WPTR. The move gave Albany its fourth sports station joining WPTR, which has shifted to NBC Sports Radio, WOFX (Fox Sports Radio) and WTMM (ESPN Radio). From 2015 to 2017, WINU aired New England Patriots football games and New York Mets baseball. Even after WINU's sports format ended, the station retained Patriots broadcasts for the 2018 season along with co-owned AM 590 WROW; however, the Patriots did not return for the 2019 season.

She has also received two MFA degrees: one from Institut d’Hautes Etudes, Paris and another from Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam. Framis has taught architecture at Delft University of Technology, and fine art at both Sandberg Instituut and ArtEZ Institute of the Arts. == Work ==  Social architecture  Key social projects include Loneliness in the City (1999-2000), which travelled to six different international cities and invited artists, architects, designers, and the general public to a portable pavilion where the aim of inventing strategies against the epidemic of urban loneliness was explored, Welcome to Guantanamo Museum (2008), a multifaceted project involving drawings, scale models, and floor plans of a proposed memorial for the infamous U.S. detention camp, and Billboardhouse (2000-2009), an open-side cube made of three billboards that costs almost nothing to make and serves as a shelter for homeless individuals.  Fashion and demonstrations  In 2003 Framis released her project anti_dog, a collection of designs made with a special fabric, Twaron, that is fire-, bullet-, and dog bite-proof. The anti_dog collection protects women against aggressive behaviour and was inspired by stories of dark complexioned women having attack dogs released at them during the night in Berlin neighborhoods populated by white supremacists. Her project Not For Sale (2008) uses photos of children with the intention of raising awareness of child slavery worldwide. For 100 Ways to Wear a Flag (2007-2008), Framis invited sixteen designers to produce a garment inspired by the Chinese flag. This highlighted the explosion of the garment export industry in modern China, while also questioning how the associations of nationhood could both empower and burden the wearer. Continuing with her decades-long exploration of topics that deal with gender inequality, Framis presented two new demonstrations in 2018. Lifedress employs elements of technology, activism and performance, while addressing sexual harassment and violence towards women. The work consists of dresses made out of airbag fabric from cars: a high tech material made in Japan with a high resistance to impacts and fire. Each dress is made to protect against a different form of (sexual) harassment, and designed to change form when intimidation occurs. The work can be seen as a social comment on gender patterns in our society nowadays, and aims to discuss a serious topic through a surrealistic act. For the work Is My Body Public? Framis uses garments to explore the borders of that which is private and that which is public, and wishes to focus attention on the issue of women’s control over their own bodies. Each of the 16 dresses is embroidered with the sentence \\"Is My Body Public?\\" in 16 different languages. While the aesthetics of the dresses resemble that of lingerie, a material usually associated with the private realm, with moments of intimacy inside the home environment, they are at the same time used actively in performance demonstrations, where the viewer is confronted with the women’s message and asked to reflect upon this.  Wishing  Cartas al Cielo by Alicia Framis, in Central Park New York during “Drifting in Daylight” organized by Creative Times, May 2015 The belief that humans can achieve a more fulfilling future is a key component of Framis's work, and is shown through projects that deal with the delicate act of wishing. Her piece Wishing Wall (1998-2001) traveled around Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, and collected a total of 1,563 wishes. The first Wishing Wall was made for the Serre di Rapolano, Italy. Framis decided to make holes in the wall because the building was from the Mussolini era and the townspeople were slightly ashamed of it. The act of making holes in the wall became a performance for Framis, and these holes were later filled in with rolled up wishes that visitors had written on slips of paper in invisible ink. This interactive piece was later shown by Jan Hoet and Nicolas Bourriaud, the curator recognized as coining the term \\"relational aesthetics.\\" Framis's sculpture Cartas al Cielo (2012), a stainless steel sphere 5 feet in diameter, was created to act as a postbox where one can send letters to the members of our lives who are no longer physically with us. The word \\"cielo\\" has a double meaning in the artist's original language of Spanish: it can mean both \\"sky\\" and \\"heaven.\\" Cartas al Cielo is an interactive work where visitors may pen letters to anyone who now lacks an earthbound address. This poetic gesture lets people focus on their desires, dreams, and the immaterial word that coincides with our physical, human one.  Notable projects  Framis's most notable projects include anti_dog (2002–2003), Walking Monument (1997), Loneliness in the City (1999–2000), Lost Astronaut (2010), and Dreamkeeper (1997).http://www.smba.nl/en/newsletters/n-35-the-dreamkeeper/ == Exhibitions == Framis's work has been presented widely at museums, galleries, and public spaces throughout the world, including solo exhibitions at Sala Alcalá 31, Madrid (2018), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2017), MUSAC, Castilla y Léon (2014), Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem (2013), La Frac Haute-Normandie, Rouen (2012), Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2010), and Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2002), among others. Her work has been featured in the 50th Venice Biennale (2003), the 2nd Berlin Biennale (2001), Performa 09 New York,http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/art/alicia-framis/lost-astronaut/17814 and Manifesta 2 Luxemburg (1998). == Recognition ==  Prizes and awards  In 1997, Framis won the prestigious Prix de Rome award for Art in Public Space; her piece “Walking Monument,” exhibited in Dam Square, Amsterdam was awarded first prize. In 2000, Framis won Prix Lleida Contemporary Art in Spain. In 2011 her piece Screaming Room was awarded Best Practice by Het Nieuwe Instituut, Rotterdam.http://virtueelplatform.nl/best- practice/screaming-room/  Collections  Framis’s work is included in numerous permanent collections, including those of Collection FRAC Lorraine (France),http://collection.fraclorraine.org/collection/showtext/248?lang=en Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst (Switzerland), Museum Boijmans van Beuningen (Netherlands),http://collectie.boijmans.nl/en/collection/3539-a-g-%28mk%29 MUSAC de Castilla y Léon (Spain), Rabo Art Collection (Netherlands),http://www.vbcn.nl/EN/messages/rabo-art-zone-alicia-framis- daily-future Sanders Collection, Stedelijk Museum Collection (Netherlands),http://stedelijk.nl/nieuwsberichten/grote-schenking-van-pieter- en-marieke-sanders-ter-ere-van-heropend-stedelijk-en-directeurschap-ann- goldstein and VandenBroek Foundation (Netherlands), among others.

It is now owned by the town, with space leased to the Masons on the second floor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. (Weld's municipal offices are located in a more modern facility on Mill Street.) ==Description and history== Weld Town Hall is located on the south side of School Street, just east of Houghton Brook and a short way east of the junction of School Street with Mill Street (Maine State Route 142). It is a large two-story rectangular wood frame structure, with a front-gable roof, shingle and clapboard siding, and a cement foundation. The first floor of the main (north-facing) facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance and two sash windows on either side. The center three bays are sheltered by a gable-roofed portico, supported by square posts, with a handicap access ramp leading down to the left. The second floor facade has four windows spaced symmetrically but at irregular intervals, with a Masonic shield at the center. The gable end has a single sash window. The interior begins with a small vestibule that opens into a large open room with a stage at the far end. To the left of the entrance stairs rise to the second floor, while there is a ticket booth and a small kitchen area (accessible only from the hall) to the right. The second floor is divided into a number of rooms leased to the Masonic lodge, and has a film projection room that contains projection equipment dating to the 1920s and 1930s. The projection area is accessed via a stepladder from the kitchen below. The hall is outfitted with a curtain which demarcates the stage area, and with retractable basketball hoops. The town of Weld was first organized as Webb's Pond Plantation in 1812, and incorporated as Weld in 1816. Its first town hall was located in the lower village, but the upper village later became more economically significant, and it is where this building is located. Construction, which took place 1922-26, was funded by the Masonic Tie Lodge No. 154, and was from the completion of its first floor opened by the Masons as a community meeting space. The Masons lost the building to foreclosure in 1937, and the town voted to purchase it from the bank in 1940.

In the meantime, Rajaram falls in love with the college girl Shanthi (Sindhuja). When Rajaram proposes his love for Shanthi, she rejects it. Shanthi, even so, advises him to convince her parents.

FORUM Pharmaceuticals, who currently is subjecting the drug to the FDA approval process, had all studies suspended until further notice in fall of 2015 due to rare, but serious gastrointestinal problems occurring in patients participating in the drug trial, potentially being a consequence of taking the drug. The trials were scheduled to be run until January 2017, but as of December 2016, they appear to still be on hold. There is speculation by FORUM Pharmaceuticals that this may be due to either the increased daily dose given in the phase III trial compared to earlier trials that showed promise. In previous trials, the highest dose given was 2 mg/day, with the most positive of effects having been realized in patients taking the largest dose (2 mg/day). In the phase III trial, all patients were treated with 3 mg/day doses of the drug. FORUM also speculates that the increase of gastrointestinal problems occurring in the phase III trial could be due to the increased demographic risk that elderly (the average age in the study was 75) and those with Alzheimer's disease have in regard to gastrointestinal issues, citing another study they conducted with a younger demographic (in which the average age was 35–40) for the treatment of schizophrenia of 1,500 individuals in which there were zero complains of gastrointestinal problems. == See also == * AR-R17779 * Bradanicline * GTS-21 * PHA-543,613 * PNU-282,987 * SSR-180,711 * TC-1698 * WAY-317,538 == References  External links == * Category:Benzothiophenes Category:Carboxamides Category:Chloroarenes Category:Experimental drugs Category:Nicotinic agonists Category:Nootropics Category:Stimulants ","title":"Encenicline"},{"id":"46398257","text":"Technicians of the Sacred is the fourteenth studio album by English progressive rock band Ozric Tentacles, released on 11 May 2015 by Snapper Music's Madfish label.

Throughout the 20th century the main activities of the family were the manufacture and distribution of steel and fabrics products through its company The Cheltenham Company, which included the import of Japanese Iron and commodities such as cotton. ==History== The Khazeni, Khazeni-Rad and Khazenifar families consist of three separate lineages, interlinked through bloodlines. After having been known as Khazeni-Allangei (Arrangei) and Abbasian, the families opted to drop the affixes and change the family name at the time of Reza Shah. The first Tehran resident of the family Agha Baba Khazeni is buried at Imamzadeh Abdullah, Rey. Agha Khan Khazeni, one of the founding members of the family is buried at the gateway of Shāh Abdol Azīm Shrine in the city of Rey, south of Tehran. The Khazeni families of Tehran became well-known and prominent in Tehran by establishing the Japanese stainless steel import lines and help found a private hospital, called Arad General Hospital. The Cheltenham Company began operating on 21 December 1954 with a board of two directors to become, five years later, one of Iran's largest import companies of Iron commodities. In 1967 the family group created the first industrial pressure gauge importing company in Iran. In 1977, the company also began investing in Texas universities but pulled their investments after during 1978 political turmoil in Iran. The company was bought out on March 1, 1981, after the Iranian revolution. ==Family Organizations & Companies== The Khazeni-Rad side of the family began its expansion into the United Kingdom in the 1960s. The Khazenifar side joined them in creating multiple companies, and helped the family move into retail, specialist dental and restaurant companies in the north of England. The Khazeni's are also based in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and the United States with interests in various other countries. * In the 20th century, the family diversified into metal imports before moving into construction activities. * In 1954, the family founded The Cheltenham Company. The company grew to 5 branches across the country with international branches in Liverpool, Dallas, Rome and Tokyo. * During the 1980s and 1990s, Mohsen Khazeni-Rad introduced new types of food and dining across the north of England.https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/son-leads-tribute-mohsen- rad-18368518?fbclid=IwAR0WNIwDwsUzgWtXtzHIEzLwfU1fklDeCiKVfLVSzzDLqBQD2At2YTEP1JI ==Awards== Professor Dr. Mohammad Khazenifar Awards for Medical Excellence at Iran's Joint and Bone Science Masters Center in Tehran.

It was closed in 1967. ==History== Woolland Brothers was started in 1869, when two brothers from Bridford in Devon took over a draper's shop at 2 Lowndes Terrace in London. The business was initially aimed at the lower echelons of society, but was noted for its good window displays. The store expanded over the years so that by 1892 it had taken over the whole of the eastern half of Lowndes Terrace (95-107 Knightsbridge). The family of three bachelor brothers Samuel, William and Moses, together with their spinster sister, were living at 17 William Street during this period. At this time the store had grown from a drapery shop to a department store, selling items as varied as household linens, soft furnishings, outfitting, haberdashery and accessories. The store had also moved up in class and was known to serve the aristocracy, with the Duchess of Portland shopping there in 1893 at the afterseason sale. In 1896 the business embarked on rebuilding the store, demolishing the original Lowndes Terrace piecemeal and completing the exercise by 1901. The new store was constructed using a steel frame and clad in Portland stone to an elaborate design by Henry L. Florence. Copper covered domes adorned each corner. The store continued to serve the aspiring middle classes and aristocracy, being used by Edward VII's mistress Alice Keppel who brought her two daughters down from Edinburgh at least four times a year. The store, however, began to appear outdated and cramped by the 1930s, and even though the business owned the freehold of the entire block between William and Seville Streets, there was no further development of the store. In 1949 Debenhams, owners of neighbouring Harvey Nichols, purchased the store. They kept the business running as a separate entity until the 1960s when it was decided unviable to run two large department stores side by side. In 1966 the property was sold and in 1967 the store was closed. In 1969 the building was demolished to make way for the Sheraton Park Tower Hotel. ==References * The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Tag Archives: Wolland Brothers Category:Debenhams Category:Defunct department stores of the United Kingdom Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:British companies established in 1869 Category:Retail companies established in 1869 Category:Knightsbridge Category:Shops in London Category:1869 establishments in England ","title":"Woolland Brothers"},{"id":"46398447","text":"Haanii Shivraj was a Malaysian actress and model from the Malaysian Indian origin.

The parish church, dedicated to Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, is under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. ==History== Church history Interior of St. Bartolome Parish Church The town of Magalang was started as a sub-parish (visita) of the neighboring town of Arayat on December 19, 1598 with Fr. Andres Hernandez as its vicar. On April 30, 1605, Magalang was officially separated from the mother town, Arayat; and Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar, OSA was appointed its first pastor. After Fr. Salazar's transfer, its parish was reverted to Arayat. In 1686, Augustinian documents mentioned that Magalang together with Tarlac, was under the pastorship of Fr. Pedro de Flores, OSA. The town was initially located in Macapsa; and may have been relocated a few more times due to frequent flooding of the Chico River and subsequent revolts. In 1734, it was transferred to San Bartolome. In 1858, Magalang experienced devastating flood due to overflow of Parua River. Two years later, a Royal Decree was issued, creating the new town of Concepcion, composed of barrios of Magalang located on the northern bank of Parua River. In 1863, the town was eventually relocated to the present site. The northern part of Magalang was separated and formally created the town of Concepcion. However, the new town is still spiritually dependent on Magalang, until the Archdiocese of Manila issued a decree, establishing the latter's parish in 1866. The exact date of the construction of the present church remains unclear although, it is suggested in the records that the construction of a structure may have started at around 1725, when the convent of Magalang was relieved from paying its dues to the Augustinian province. The current church, was built by Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia, OSA in 1866. In 1875, Fr. Baltasar Gamarra, OSA finished the facade and the two storey bell tower. In 1887, Fr. Fernando Vasquez, OSA continued the finishing touches and installed two large bells in 1889 and 1890 respectively; and its tones is one of the best in whole Pampanga. Fr. Toribio Fanjul, OSA renovated the church flooring and sacristy in 1891. During the revolutionary period, the church convent was occupied by the revolutionaries, and it was converted into a prison for Spanish captives. On November 5, 1899, the Americans captured the convent from the revolutionaries, and they reconstituted as their military headquarters in Magalang until 1901. During Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers stationed at the belfry, served as their observatory post. In early 50s, a major renovation of the church was done during the early administration of Rev. Fr. Pedro N. Magtoto. The old retablo was demolished, to give way the second altar, composed of large crucifix at the center of the altar. The wooden flooring are removed, and the choir loft was demolished. In 1978, the old convent was renovated and converted into parish hall during the administration of Rev. Fr. Odon T. Santos. During his administration also, the concrete Stations of the Cross were installed and the altar was further renovated. In 2002, Rev. Fr. Raul C. de los Santos renovated the altar and repaired the convent. In 2015, Rev. Fr. Mario Sol M. Gabriel initiated the revival of the original retablo. He also mechanized the existing old church bells, constructed the steel fence and installed a modern ventilation system inside the church. In 2017, National Museum of the Philippines bestowed the church as one of the Important Cultural Properties of the Philippines. ==List of parish priests== * Rev. Fr.

Mary married the Quaker Henry Boreham (or Boreman). In 1662 she was briefly imprisoned in the aftermath of the uprising of the Fifth Monarchy men. Her husband was imprisoned \\"for selling religious books\\", and died in prison the same year, leaving Mary with three children (and pregnant with a fourth). In 1670 she gave up her business (an oil shop in Leadenhall Street, in London) and went to live with two other widows (one of whom may have been Jane Leade) in Tottenham. Whilst there, she disassociated herself from the Quakers and became associated with the mystic ex-Quaker John Pennyman, who had been disowned by George Fox and started holding his own meetings in the 1660s. By 1670 Pennyman, who had initially been married to Mary's sister (either Elizabeth Heron or Dinah Bond), was a widower. Mary was prompted by God to move in with Pennyman in 1671. Pennyman hired a hall to feed 250 people and announced their marriage, in a ceremony widely mocked by others. The wedding feast, with 27 venison pasties and a hogshead of red wine, was the exact opposite of that advised by the Quakers and William Penn went into print to point this out. Others like Thomas and Ann Mudd remained close friends and followers. Many of Mary's letters and writings are included in her husband's publications. In 1672-3 the pair were prompted by God to walk through Essex and Hertfordshire. In 1691 they went to live with Pennyman's son-in-law in Bishopsgate, before moving into the country.

They are called \\"Ohio Valley Siouan\\" languages because of a speculative origin along the Ohio River, but only the Tutelo and the Saponi historically dwelled near there; they possibly migrated to the Roanoke River from the region of the Big Sandy River just prior to European contact.

However, Voegelin argued that \\"not only Biloxi and Ofo but also Tutelo form one group which I propose to call Ohio Valley Siouan. The implication that this group dispersed from the Ohio River Valley (the Tutelo moving east, the Biloxi and Ofo moving south) goes one step beyond Swanton's inference that the Ofo can be identified with the Mosopelea of the Ohio: it places the Biloxi and Tutelo in the Ohio Valley at the time when the Ofo were known as the Mosopelea, or just prior to that time.\\" ==References== Category:Western Siouan languages ","title":"Ohio Valley Siouan languages"},{"id":"46398556","text":"Iván Madarász (born 1949, Budapest) is a Hungarian composer.International who's who in music and musicians' directory Ernest Kay - 1985 MADARASZ, Ivan, b. 10 Feb. 1949, Budapest, Hungary.

It consists of the HİSAR-A low altitude air defense system, HİSAR-O medium range air defence system and HİSAR-U (renamed as Siper) long range air defence system. Guidance is infrared homing.http://www.roketsan.com.tr/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/HISAR-ENG-email.pdf ==Development history== On 18 April 2007, the Turkish Undersecretariat for Defence Industries issued a request for information to international and domestic defence companies to meet a low to medium altitude air defense requirements under Turkey's Low Altitude Air Defence Missile System (T-LALADMIS) programme or Alçak İrtifa Hava Savunma Füze Sistemi in Turkish. A total of 18 companies responded to the RFI.http://www.ssm.gov.tr/home/quick/announcements/project/archive/Sayfalar/07_Comp_T- LALADMIS.aspx A subsequent request for proposal was issued on 28 September 2008, for the direct acquisition of 18 systems and options for up to 27 additional systems.http://www.ssm.gov.tr/home/quick/announcements/project/archive/Sayfalar/08_RFP_T- LALADMISPro.aspx The contract was eventually awarded to Aselsan as the prime contractor on 20 June 2015. Other sub-contractors include Tübitak Sage for warhead and battery and Meteksan Savunma for data link. The award consist of a low-altitude system for 314,9 million euros and a medium-altitude system (T-MALADMIS) for 241,4 million euros. Missile tests of Hisar-A begun in 2013 and Hisar-O begun in 2014. On 8 December 2016 Hisar-O conducted its first missile test with successfully. In a test on 7 December 2017, a steep- trajectory firing was carried out for the first time from the HİSAR systems, while their 360-degrees protection was also tested successfully. Flight and ballistic tests were also carried out. For the first time in the campaign, within which control and guidance capabilities of the HİSAR missiles met expectations, radar, command-control and fire control, electro-optic and communications elements of the HİSAR systems were also included for the first time. Target aircraft, target detection and follow-up, command and fire control and mid-range bombsight tests were successfully performed. In September 2020, Ismail Demir announced that improved versions of Hisar A and O as A+ and O+ were developed after feedback regarding the missiles' performance. He also stated that a variant would be developed to fill the gap between Hisar O and Hisar U. On 1 February 2018 Hisar-A conducted a successful missile test in Aksaray province of Turkey. On 12 October 2019, Hisar-A finish its final development tests and approved by the defence ministry for mass production. Ismail Demir, the head of Turkey's Presidency of Defense Industries told Hisar-A will enter the inventory in 2020, in a press conference in the capital Ankara. ==Operational history== On 3 March 2020, Turkey said the system would be deployed in Syria's Idlib province as part of Operation Spring Shield.Turkey to deploy domestic air defense systems in Syria soon Bangladesh has also expressed interest in the HISAR-O air defense system. ==HİSAR-A== HİSAR-A (Turkish: Alçak İrtifa Hava Savunma Füze Sistemi) is based on an FNSS ACV-30 tracked vehicle chassis armed with four vertical launched Hisar-A short-range missiles supplied by Roketsan. The tracked Hisar-A system mounts its own mast-mounted KALKAN Air Defence Radar and an electro- optic/infrared (EO/IR) system, allowing it to operate as an independent standalone system without the need to operate as a battery with a separate FCS. * Minimum range: 2 km * Maximum range: 15 km * Minimum altitude: 30 metres * Maximum altitude: 10 km It was announced in 2020 that some orders on HİSAR-A would be replaced in favour of HİSAR-O which has a slightly longer effective engagement range and higher maximum altitude despite the size staying the same. ==HİSAR-O== HİSAR-O at IDEF2019. HİSAR-O (Turkish: Orta İrtifa Hava Savunma Füze Sistemi) is a vertical launched medium-range SAM system mounted on a Mercedes-Benz Zetros chassis. After the increasing Turkish activity in Libya and Syria a new extended range variant of Hisar-O was allegedly deployed to borders in June 2020. * Minimum range: 3 km * Maximum range: 25 km * Minimum altitude: 50 meters * Maximum altitude: 15 km ==HİSAR-U== HİSAR-U (Turkish: Uzun Menzilli Hava Savunma Füze Sistemi) aka Siper (meaning \\"trench\\") is a long-range SAM system being developed at National Technology Development Infrastructures.

England were the inaugural hosts of the World Cup, holding the first ever tournament in 1975. The country has since hosted the tournament a further four times; in 1979, 1983, 1999 and 2019, the most of any other country.

In the semi- final, England were reduced to 37/7, as Gary Gilmour took 6/14, the best World Cup bowling figures at the time They were eventually bowled out for 93 in 36.2 overs. Australia initially suffered a collapse just as dramatic, falling to 39/6, before Gary Gilmour scored 28 from 28 balls, to help Australia to victory.

England won all of their group matches, and defeated New Zealand in a close semi-final by 9 runs. In the final, they lost to the West Indies. In the semi- final, England began badly, falling to 38/2, before Mike Brearley (53 from 115 balls) and Graham Gooch (71 from 84 balls) resurrected the innings. Derek Randall (42 from 50 balls) scored quickly in the second half of the innings, and 25 runs from the last 3 overs of the innings saw England reach 221/8 from their 60 overs. In response, New Zealand reached 47 from 16 overs, before Bruce Edgar was out lbw. John Wright top-scored with 69 from 137 balls, before being run out. However, New Zealand continued to lose wickets, and they required 14 runs from the last over of the match, and England won by 9 runs, at the time the smallest winning margin by runs in World Cup matches. In the final, the West Indies got off to a bad start, falling to 99/4. However, a \\"match winning performance\\" of 138 from 157 balls from Vivian Richards, and an aggressive innings from Collis King (86 from 66 balls) consolidated the innings with a 139 run partnership, as the West Indies scored 286/9 from 60 overs. In reply, the English openers, Mike Brearley (64 from 130 balls) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105 balls), scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, but by the time both batsmen were out, the run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Gooch triggered the biggest collapse in World Cup history, as England lost 8/11; Joel Garner took 5/3 in 11 balls. They were eventually all out for 194 in 51 overs.

They won 5 of their 6 group stage matches, losing against New Zealand, and qualified for the semi- final. In the semi-final, they were defeated by India \\"with great ease\\". In the semi-final, England batted first, and reached 69 before losing opener Chris Tavaré. Medium pacer Mohinder Amarnath and off-spinner Kirti Azad helped slow the scoring rate, as England only managed 213 from their 60 overs. In reply, Yashpal Sharma (61 from 115 balls) and Sandeep Patil (51 from 32 balls) made half-centuries, and Amarnath and Yashpal's managed a 92 run partnership.

England matched their previous best performance, by reaching the final before losing to Australia. In the semi-final, India chose to field first. After reaching 79/2, Graham Gooch (115 from 136 balls) and captain Mike Gatting (56 from 62 balls) shared a partnership of 117 runs in 19 overs. In the end, England reached 254/6 from their 50 overs. In reply, India made a bad start, and were 73/3. The middle order were more fluent, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls) top scoring. When Azharuddien was dismissed, India were 204/5 from 41 overs, and required 51 from 9 overs with 5 wickets in hand. However, they collapsed and were all out for 219 in 45.3 overs. In the final, Australia won the toss and chose to bat. David Boon (75 from 125 balls, 7 fours) top-scored for Australia, Helped by Mike Veletta (45 from 31 balls), Australia scored 65 runs from the last 6 overs of their innings, and posted 253/5 from their 50 overs. England opener Tim Robinson was out lbw for a first ball duck. Bill Athey (58 from 103 balls) top-scored, and England were almost on target. However, when captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls) was out playing an attempted reverse sweep off the occasional off-spin bowling of Allan Border, this ended a growing partnership of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Bill Athey. Allan Lamb's innings of 45 from 55 balls was insufficient, as the required run-rate for England began to rise, requiring 17 off the last over, and eventually losing by 7 runs.

England won 5 of their 8 pool stage matches, with 1 no result, and easily qualified for the Semi-Final, despite a surprising lost to Zimbabwe in their final group match. Their semi- final was memorable due to a target recalculation under the most productive overs rule which removed any chance for South Africa to win the match. Despite being favourites to win the final, England lost to Pakistan, their third World Cup Final defeat. The semi final between South Africa and England ended in controversial circumstances when, after a 10-minute rain delay, the most productive overs method revised South Africa's target from 22 runs from 13 balls to an impossible 21 runs from one ball. After the World Cup, ODIs used a different formula as a result of this incident, and it was eventually superseded by the Duckworth–Lewis method for the 1999 World Cup. According to the late Bill Frindall, had the Duckworth–Lewis method been applied at that rain interruption, the revised target would have been four runs to tie or five to win from the final ball.\\"Stump the Bearded Wonder\\". England were favourites to win, having bowled out Pakistan for just 74 earlier in the tournament. A repeat looked possible when Derek Pringle dismissed both Pakistani openers, making the score 24/2. However, Imran Khan and Javed Miandad settled down to see off the new ball. A crucial moment occurred when Imran Khan was dropped by Graham Gooch at 9 runs. He later went on to score a match-winning 72. At the 25 over mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139 by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner and Imran and him built a steady partnership. During his innings, Imran Khan hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members' section. Imran went on to score 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250. England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was dismissed for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother left Imran with no choice but to give an early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote the fate of the match. Two magical deliveries from the great left-arm fast bowler showed Allan Lamb and the dangerous Chris Lewis the pavilion door. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid down, Captain Imran Khan had the last laugh when end man Richard Illingworth was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and crown Pakistan World Cup winners.

In the Super 8 stage, they were eliminated, beating Ireland, Bangladesh and West Indies but losing to 4 other Test-playing nations. In their opening match, England lost Ed Joyce for a duck off the first legitimate delivery of the match, and only Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett, the numbers eight and nine, managed a strike rate above 70. With the fall of Paul Collingwood at the end of 35th over, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming brought on Shane Bond, and he removed Kevin Pietersen, England's top-scorer, and Andrew Flintoff in the same over. Jamie Dalrymple followed three overs later, as England had lost four wickets for five runs, but Nixon and Plunkett batted out the remaining 12 overs, making 71. In reply, New Zealand lost two wickets in eight balls to James Anderson and Liam Plunkett, and also had captain Fleming back for a single-figure score. However, from then on they made 191 for the loss of only one wicket, Craig McMillan caught off Monty Panesar's bowling. Scott Styris and Jacob Oram added an unbeaten 138 for the fifth wicket, just ten runs off the New Zealand record from the 1999 World Cup,ODI Partnership Records for New Zealand , from Cricinfo, retrieved 16 March 2007 resulting in a man-of-the-match award for Styris. Their final match against Kenya was effectively a playoff match against the 2003 semi-finalists. Ed Joyce's second fifty in as many matches helped England qualify for the Super Eights. Steve Tikolo came in at four after James Anderson had removed both openers, and though he made his 20th half-century, none of his team-mates passed 20. Extras were the second-highest contributor, with six wides and eight no-balls, most of the latter coming from Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff, who bowled three no-balls each. Flintoff did get Tikolo out with a yorker,Joyce and Pietersen take England home, Andrew McGlashan, Cricinfo, retrieved 26 March 2007 while three of Kenya's players were run out as they were bowled out on the last ball of the rain-reduced innings. Kenya's opening bowler Peter Ongondo extracted \\"tennis-ball bounce\\" to remove Michael Vaughan for one with the 19th ball of the game; however, despite Ian Bell getting caught for 16, England had reduced the equation to 126 off 34.2 overs after Joyce and Bell's partnership. With Kevin Pietersen also getting a fifty, England made it through with ten overs to spare. In their first Super 8 match, England won the toss and batted first, but lost both openers to Boyd Rankin in six overs, before Ian Bell spent 74 balls making his 31. When Bell got out, the run rate was slightly above 4; in the final 28 overs, it was in excess of 6, with Paul Collingwood making 90, Kevin Pietersen 48 and Andrew Flintoff 43. Kyle McCallan was the most economical bowler for Ireland, and also took the wicket of Pietersen. Chasing 267 in reply, Niall O'Brien's third One-day International fifty and his second of the World Cup helped Ireland to a total of 139 for six in the 37th over, but despite faster than a run a ball scores from Trent Johnston and Andrew White Ireland fell 48 runs short as Andrew Flintoff took the final two wickets, though they exceeded their previous World Cup record total by seven runs.

However, a victory against South Africa and a tie against eventual winners India helped England progress to the quarter-finals, where they lost to Sri Lanka. England's opening match was against the Netherlands. Batting first, the Netherlands scored 292, the second highest score from an Associate nation playing against a Test nation, helped by a Ryan ten Doeschate century, and late innings acceleration to score 104 runs off the last ten overs of the innings. In reply, England started wrongly, reaching 100/0 at a run a ball, before losing Kevin Pietersen. England captain Andrew Strauss fell just short of a century, and all the England top order batsmen scored runs, with Paul Collingwood and Ravi Bopara taking England home with 1.2 overs to spare. India batted first and opener Sachin Tendulkar scored his 47th ODI century and 5th World Cup century, the highest number of centuries by anyone ever in a World Cup. Support came from Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh who both made half- centuries. Tim Bresnan took his first five-wicket haul in ODI matches, which included three wickets with four balls in the 49th over. Chasing 339 to win, Andrew Strauss made his highest score in ODI cricket, with 158, before being dismissed by Zaheer Khan. Ian Bell survived an earlier LBW appeal, after it was referred via the DRS system. After a collapse from England, Graeme Swann scored one run off the final ball, tying the match. Against Ireland, England batted first with Jonathan Trott top-scoring, with 92 from 92 balls. England batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell also hit half-centuries, with Trott and Bell sharing a 177 run partnership. England finished on 327/8 from their 50 overs, having only scored 33 runs from their last 5 overs. In reply, Ireland lost their captain, William Porterfield in the very first ball, and were struggling at 111/5 after 25 overs. Kevin O'Brien came in with the score at 106/4, and made 113 in just 63 balls, including the fastest century in World Cup history, as Ireland won the match by 3 wickets, with five balls to spare. It was the largest successful run chase in Cricket World Cup history. Against South Africa, England batted first and lost the wickets of Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen in the first over. Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara put on a partnership worth 99 runs, but England finished all out for 171, with four overs still remaining. In reply, South Africa reached 124 with the loss of just three wickets, but then lost the next four wickets inside five overs for three runs. Stuart Broad took the final two wickets, to give England victory by six runs. Bangladesh's score was at one point 169/8 but tail ender 58 run partnership brought victory for the team. Bangladesh's win in this match was only their second against England in a total of 15 ODIs. Their final group match was against the West Indies, and England had to win the game to have any realistic chance of going through to the quarter finals. England chose to bat, and started quickly thanks to Jonathan Trott, who scored 47; they were 94/2 from 15 overs. However, they crumbled in the middle overs, and ended up being bowled out for 243. In reply, Chris Gayle started quickly, including 18 off a Chris Tremlett over, before being dismissed in the seventh over. The West Indies were reduced to 150-6, before a seventh-wicket partnership of 72 between Ramnaresh Sarwan and Andre Russell helped the West Indies reach 222-6 at the end of the 42nd over. However Tredwell and Swann took 3 wickets, and Trott ran out Sulieman Benn, as the West Indies were all out for 225. In the quarter-final, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target of 230 to win by ten wickets; this run chase set a new record for the highest successful run chase in a ten-wicket victory in ODI history.ESPN Cricinfo, Records, One Day Internationals, Team Records, Largest Margin of Victory (by Wickets), Retrieved 27 March 2011.

Although they beat Associate nations Scotland and Afghanistan, this was not enough to qualify for the Knockout Stage. This was the third time that they had not progressed from the Group Stage. England's fixtures began with 2 games against co-hosts Australia and New Zealand- they lost both. They reduced Australia to 52/2, and 70/3 in the 11th over. Stand-in captain George Bailey and Aaron Finch then put together a 146 run-partnership in 26 overs, and Australia accelerated their scoring rate with Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh and Brad Haddin. Despite a hattrick from Steven Finn in the last 3 balls of the innings, Australia finished at 342/9. In reply, England were reduced to 92/6. Despite a 92-run partnership between James Taylor and Chris Woakes, England found themselves at 195/9. They eventually reached 231, before James Anderson was incorrectly given run out; Taylor finished on 98*, and England lost by 111 runs. England's next match was against the other co- hosts, New Zealand. After electing to bat first, England were bowled out for 123 in the 34th over, having lost their last seven wickets for 19 runs in eight overs. New Zealand fast bowler Tim Southee picked up 7/33 in his 9 overs, which was the third-best haul in World Cup history. In reply, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum scored the fastest World Cup fifty reaching the landmark in just 18 balls, and New Zealand were 105/0 after 7 overs. McCullum was dismissed off the first ball of the eighth over for 77, and the other opener, Martin Guptill also fell to the bowling of Chris Woakes in the tenth over. New Zealand consolidated the innings following this and went on to win the game by 8 wickets with more than 37 overs to spare. After 2 heavy defeats, England looked to bounce back against Scotland, who were the lowest ranked team in the Group, and had never beaten England in an ODI. Batting first, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell put on an opening partnership of 172. However, in the first 3 overs of the batting powerplay England lost 3 wickets for 2 runs, including top-scorer Moeen Ali, and despite a 49 run partnership between Eoin Morgan and James Taylor and a 45 run partnership between Morgan and Jos Buttler, England only reached 309/8, with just 131 runs scored in the last 20 overs. In reply, Scotland started confidently with Kyle Coetzer (71) sharing an early 60 run partnership with Preston Mommsen. However, after Mommsen's dismissal, Scotland continued to lose wickets throughout the innings, including Steven Finn dismissing Coetzer for 71. Eventually, they lost their last 7 wickets for 70 runs, with 6 batsmen scoring fewer than 10 runs, as Scotland were bowled out for 184, and England won by 119 runs. England's match against Sri Lanka was the chance to get a first win against a Test-playing nation in the tournament. However, from 62/0, their innings was reduced to 101/3 in the 21st over. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the fourth wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth-wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs. Sri Lankan innings began with Lahiru Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Tillakaratne Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Kumar Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. With just 1 win in 4 matches, England entered this match knowing that they had to win in order to avoid being eliminated. After being put into bat, Bangladesh were 8/2, and later 99/4. However, a 141-run partnership between Mahmudullah Riyad and Mushfiqur Rahim (the highest partnership for Bangladesh in a World Cup match) helped Bangladesh reach 275/7, their highest score against England in ODI cricket. Mahmudullah Riyad became the first player to score a century for Bangladesh in a World Cup match. England started well, reaching 97/1, including a 54-run partnership between Ian Bell and Alex Hales. However, England then collapsed to 132/5 10 overs later, with the collapse led by Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. When Joe Root was caught behind, England needed 113 to win from 14 overs. Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes put on 75 runs for the seventh wicket, but Buttler fell for 65, and England were ultimately bowled out for 260. In their last game, England beat Afghanistan in a rain- affected match.

England entered the tournament as favourites, having been ranked the number one ODI side by the ICC for over a year prior to the tournament. England began their campaign on 30 May in the opening match of the tournament against South Africa at The Oval. England batted first and, despite losing opener Jonny Bairstow for a golden duck to the second ball of the tournament, went on to score 311/8, with Ben Stokes top-scoring with 89 runs. In reply, South Africa were bowled out for 207, which included a collapse of eight wickets for 63 runs, to give England victory by 104 runs. The next match saw the hosts suffer a shock defeat to Pakistan at Trent Bridge. After England won the toss and elected to field, Pakistan scored 348/8, with Mohammad Hafeez making 84. England managed a score of 334/9, losing by 14 runs despite centuries from both Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) with a substantial 130-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Against Bangladesh at Sophia Gardens, England were put in to bat and made a total of 386/6, Jason Roy scoring 153 from 121 deliveries. Bangladesh were subsequently all out for 280 after Shakib Al Hasan scored 121, England winning by 106 runs. England next travelled to Hampshire to face the West Indies at the Hampshire Bowl. England were able to restrict the West Indies to 212 after winning the toss and choosing to field, with Mark Wood taking figures of 3/18. An unbeaten hundred from Joe Root took England to a comfortable eight-wicket win with over 16 overs remaining. Against Afghanistan at Old Trafford, England set a target of 397/6, their highest ever World Cup total. Eoin Morgan scored 148 runs from 78 balls, including 17 sixes, a record for an individual innings in an ODI. England also surpassed their own record for the most sixes by a team in an ODI, with 25. In Afghanistan's innings, they could only manage 247/8, handing England a comfortable victory by 150 runs. Bowling first in their next match against Sri Lanka at Headingley, England required a total of 233 runs to win after Sri Lanka finished their innings with 232/9, Angelo Mathews scoring an unbeaten 85. However, England struggled against Lasith Malinga as they were bowled out for 212 in reply, Malinga taking 4/43 as England suffered another shock defeat by 20 runs. Ben Stokes provided England with some hope of a victory, finishing on 82 not out.

The whodunnit game, which sees the player assume the role of a detective out to solve a series of murder cases by examining the crime scenes, has been described as \\"part escape-the-room and part hidden-object, with a bit of puzzle-solving mixed in\\". The game is available for iOS devices. ==Production== Prior to this game, the developers worked on the Blue Toad Murder Files series, which is thematically similar to the subject matter of this game. Relentless Software CEO Andrew Eades explained that while Blue Toad Murder Files was originally conceived as a PlayStation 3 DualShock game, it translated well to a touch pad interface. Becoming the No.1 app on iPad demonstrated to the company a market for puzzle adventure murder mystery games on these devices. The developers wanted to swap that game's cartoony family- targeted style for something more gritty, dramatic, and adult; therefore the franchise was split in two, becoming Murder Files: The Enigma Express and The Trace. Eades explained \\"The Trace’s origins can be found in a prototype from 2010 called Blue Toad Crime Scenes\\". This \\"small\\" prototype was developed as a result of a series of discussions regarding how Relentless Software could further develop the Blue Toad franchise. Crime Scenes \\"experimented with ways to provide a more detailed crime exploration experience, where you'd take a much more hands-on approach to finding evidence\\". The game was not the basis of The Trace, but it provided the team with an opportunity to \\"create a really tactile investigation-based game\\" and see future potential in the genre. In the game's official press release, Eades said the following: ==Design== The Trace described the formulation of the game's narrative: \\"Initially we worked out a story per scene but found it was challenging to connect them as a whole. In the end our writer David Varela wrote the whole story independently of scenes and gameplay. Then the best crime scenes within the story were picked out and recreated in the game.\\" Many conversations were had between Varela and the game's producers regarding \\"just how dark we could go\\"; in particular two areas of contention were the state of Warren Oakley when the player finds him, and the injuries sustained by the dog Floyd. A \\"good balance\\" was achieved by the end of development. A web-of-leads mechanic was chosen after a design process which considered how various mechanics and interface would work visually and logistically. The aim was to make the player \\"feel like they were connecting clues and solving the case\\", so considerable effort was done to decide how to realise this without creating something too complex. The lack of a hint system was chosen as the developers felt hints in games such as these were either too easy or too out-of-left field. They also considered using hints as a monitisation feature, but this was ultimately rejected. They reasoned that rather than try to craft hints based on specific \\"pain points\\" they identified, players can get the personalised help they need via social media. Eades stated, \\"It's a bit of an experiment, but it means we can engage with the players as they play.\\" The designers also made a deliberate choice to leave the detective protagonist unvoiced, as narration would have jarringly removed the player from the gaming experience and would have prevented the player from projecting themselves into the role. The Trace uses Apple's Metal, and Gina Nelson designed much of the character concept art for the game. , the game is available in English, French, German and Spanish. David Varela, who \\"wrote the story and script, as well as a series of in-character blog posts published in the run-up to the game's launch\\" said that Pocketgamer described the game as \\"The Room meets Phoenix Wright meets CSI\\", commenting that this is \\"pretty much what we were aiming for\\". He described the game as \\"huge fun to write\\" due to \\"haggling with the team over just how decapitated we can make that corpse\\". The game's musical landscape began life as a series of musical sketches which were created by the sound designer during early pre-production. After the lead artist created an overarching style guide later in development, he was able to articulate a more detailed and specific design by \\"select[ing] around 15 tracks from various artists that he felt were a good fit\\". Eight external composers were sent these tracks, plus a music brief which described the \\"various moods, genres, and techniques he wanted to hear in the game\\". The development team reviewed the composer pitches, and subsequently hired the favoured entrant to score the whole game. ==Plot== The player assumes the role of Baltimore police detective Sam Pearce, who begins the game investigating a suicide which is later revealed to be a murder which leads to a series of chain events. Throughout the game, Pearce calls his lab partner Alex to discuss what is known so far, to follow up of potential leads, and to receive the results of tested DNA. Eventually, a kidnapping and extortion plot is revealed, and the detective unravels the truth behind the murders. ==Gameplay== This is a unique mechanic of The Trace that allows players to piece together the story behind the crime scene by testing hypotheses with their gathered clues. The game \\"combines The Room-style screen poking, point and click puzzle solving, and hidden object hunting – and gives it a crime- solving twist.\\" Players examine clue hotspots throughout the scene and collect useful items to unlock further rooms or clues. They can use a forensic flashlight to discover traces of blood on some and rotate them 360 degrees, similar to later games in the Ace Attorney franchise. As clues are discovered, the player pieces them together in a webbed flow-chart of lead questions which need to be answered to understand the full scenario. Each answered question results in a video demonstrating the events. Players move from screen to screen and can rotate 360 degrees, similar to Google Maps street view and the later games in the Myst series. Though dependent on one's \\"style of play and deductive ability\\", The Trace states a ballpark figure of 3 hours of gameplay on its FAQ. The game lacks a hint system but allows player to tweet for help via the #SolveTheTrace hashtag if they get stuck, or post to social media like Facebook where they will likely receive a reply from Relentless. As this is a paid game, unlike free-to-play games in similar genres, players do not have to wait for energy or points to recharge and can advance directly through the three-chapter storyline. The game also does not have any fail-states, and features iCloud saving to allow players to continue on different devices. The game saves automatically as the player advances through the level. According to Pocket Gamer, the game should be played in the iPad. The Trace recommends that players should use an \\"iPad 2 and above & iPhone 4S and above, running iOS 7 and above\\", and said that while an iPhone 4 is acceptable it may result in performance issues. Relentless Software encourages players to experience the game by wearing headphones to take in the \\"captivating\\" music and sound. == Release == The Twitter account was launched on 26 January, the game was officially announced on 26 February, and it previewed at the 2015 Game Developers Conference in early March. It was released on 26 March and will be released on Android's Google Play Store in the near future. To help publicise the game, The Trace offered two tickets to an Evening of Mystery and Murder event. Gamezebo hoped the game would be the first in a series of instalments. The Trace tweeted on 2 April \\"To everyone asking for more. We're so pleased your enjoying the game! We'll definitely be looking at this if there's enough interest\\" \\\\- adding on their FAQ page \\"maybe new cases or even a full sequel\\". Eades stated \\" I always look to create something that can be a franchise. We still have plans for Season 2 of Murder Files, for example. With Sam and Alex, we’d like to see some DLC or even a sequel. That all depends on the success of the first one, though. We’ve certainly built The Trace engine with that in mind.\\" ==Critical reception== The game has received a very positive reception, gaining a Metacritic score of 82% based on six critic reviews. Many liked the well-written logical murder-mystery plot, and have deemed it one of the few satisfying iOS games of the genre along with Detective Grimoire and the Sherlock Holmes PC series. Similarly, the engrossing and immersive nature of the game, which is played in a first-person perspective (by a character who realistically comments on clicked objects) was highly praised. This is aided by the game's soundtrack with a perfect balance of whimsy and dread, and its detailed realistic graphics. The ability to manipulate items (even those with no relevance to the case) and tilt the camera to further explore scenes have also been praised. Its mix of genres meant that critic felt players would like at least some aspects of the game. However, the game was criticised for not being long enough and being too expensive, for lacking in difficulty and re- playability, for having slightly imprecise/finicky/clunky controls, for not having Pierce and Alex voiced, and for being linear or streamlined. The realistic, manipulable 3D environments were highly praised by critics. The Guardian listed the game in both their articles 20 best iPhone and iPad apps and games this week (on 30 March 2015) and 20 best apps and games for April, describing it as a \\"proper murder-mystery detective game [that] sucks you in\\" despite being \\"quite short\\", and an engrossing \\"hard-boiled detective yarn...in interactive form\\" Mark Brown of Pocket Gamer declared it \\"The best iOS game this week\\" on 27 March 2015, commenting that while it was not \\"massively complicated or particularly difficult\\", the game is very good at sucking the player into the action. A different Pocket Gamer article praised its ability to unpatronisingly \\"allow the player to untangl[e] the leads and establish...the connections\\" all on their own, rather than making them \\"the Watson to the protagonist's Sherlock\\", deeming the game \\"pleasant if not pulse-pounding\\". Sarah Jacobsson Purewal of MacWorld placed the game in her You Should Play feature, deeming it \\"an epic game of whodunit\\" – a \\"precisely planned-out mystery with a strong, well-written script\\" and a gritty realistic \\"extremely searchable\\" 3D environment. Recombu praised the game's \\"slick, professional presentation\\" and \\"beautifully rendered...detailed environments\\", though wished the developers had recorded dialogue for the text that appears onscreen when interacting with the environment. The Daily Express listed the game as one of the five best new iOS games in time for Easter, while Apple highlighted the game in its Editors Choice section in March. The Daily Herald said the \\"well-constructed, compelling app\\" required \\"a sharp eye\\" and \\"a willingness to think outside the box\\", adding that while \\"not violent or particularly realistic\\", the game may upset younger or sensitive players. Touch Arcade liked that \\"there's no searching for the sake of searching\\", with each item and puzzle having a purpose and helping the player advance in a logical way, unlike The Room, and the games of Sierra and LucasArts. The site described the branching diagram players use to test hypotheses and make deductions as \\"a very nice device that forwards the game's narrative without breaking the immersion.\\" The Independent said the game has a \\"twisted artistry\\", was worth its £4 price despite the short length, and is the best detective mystery game \\"you only have to click 'get' for\\". The Arts Desk described the game as a \\"one-man mashup of CSI and Columbo\\" with \\"simple, slightly silly\\" cases when compared to the \\"emotionally wrung-through gut punches\\" of True Detective and Heavy Rain, concluding \\"this is the emotionally light and intellectually undemanding videogame equivalent of a Murder She Wrote or Quincy case – and has a similarly clichéd and homely charm\\". Gamezebo described the serious, thoughtful atmosphere, and the detective's \\"sardonic sense of humor\\"; the site praised the game's \\"minimalist, mostly menu-less style\\", which turned everyday actions into immersive \\"fun gameplay mechanics\\". It concluded \\"the truly rewarding moments in The Trace are exploring its gorgeous, accessible world and feeling like you are a physical part of it\\". Apple'N'Apps described the game as \\"well thought out and crafted\\", while Multiplayer.it said it had a \\"well crafted system for exploring, investigating and manipulating the environment\\" which allows the player to experience a realistic and believable crime scene investigation. Trusted Reviews called it a \\"a short, but nevertheless captivating take on the world of the lone detective, wrapping a compelling mystery around solid controls and a detailed environment On complaints regarding its price, Cayman Compass wrote, \\"I was surprised that some people complained about it being $4.99 for just the one mystery...a lot of work went into its design, and it costs less than a burger\\". ==References * Facebook page * Twitter account * Google+ account * Home page * Trailer Category:2015 video games Category:Detective video games Category:IOS games Category:IOS-only games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in the United States ","title":"The Trace (video game)"},{"id":"46398901","text":"Kenneth Charles Loach (born 17 June 1936) is an English filmmaker. His socially critical directing style and socialist ideals are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty (Poor Cow, 1967), homelessness (Cathy Come Home, 1966), and labour rights (Riff-Raff, 1991, and The Navigators, 2001). Loach's film Kes (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) and I, Daniel Blake (2016), received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him one of only nine filmmakers to win the award twice. Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK are \\"a Kafka-esque, Catch-22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\\". ==Early life== Kenneth Charles Loach was born on 17 June 1936 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Vivien (née Hamlin) and John Loach. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School and went on to read law at St Peter's College, Oxford.Ken Loach at Sixteen Films. Retrieved 31 July 2016 He graduated with a law degree in 1957. As a member of the Oxford University Experimental Theatre Club he directed an open- air production of Bartholomew Fair for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford, in 1959 (when he also took the role of the shady horse-dealer Dan Jordan Knockem). After Oxford, he spent two years in the Royal Air Force and then began a career in the dramatic arts. ==Career== Loach worked first as an actor in regional theatre companies and then as a director for BBC Television. His 10 contributions to the BBC's Wednesday Play anthology series include the docudramas Up the Junction (1965), Cathy Come Home (1966) and In Two Minds (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be lost. His 1965 play Three Clear Sundays dealt with capital punishment, and was broadcast at a time when the debate was at a height in the United Kingdom.Insert booklet for DVD boxset Ken Loach at the BBC Up the Junction, adapted by Nell Dunn from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in Cathy Come Home, by Jeremy Sandford, are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. In Two Minds, written by David Mercer, concerns a young schizophrenic woman's experiences of the mental health system. Tony Garnett began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s. During this period, he also directed the absurdist comedy The End of Arthur's Marriage, about which he later said that he was \\"the wrong man for the job\\". Coinciding with his work for The Wednesday Play, Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with Poor Cow (1967) and Kes (1969). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his kestrel, and is based on the novel A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines. The film was well received, although the use of Yorkshire dialect throughout the film restricted its distribution, with some American executives at United Artists saying that they would have found a film in Hungarian easier to understand.Interview – Ken Loach (KES, 1970), La Semaine de la critique. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.A selection of the favourite British films of the 20th century During the 1970s and 1980s, Loach's films were less successful, often suffering from poor distribution, lack of interest and political censorship. His documentary The Save the Children Fund Film (1971) was commissioned by the charity, who subsequently disliked it so much they attempted to have the negative destroyed. It was only screened publicly for the first time on 1 September 2011, at the BFI Southbank.Stephen Bates \\"Ken Loach documentary to get first screening after 40 years\\", The Guardian, 20 July 2011 Loach concentrated on television documentaries rather than fiction during the 1980s, and many of these films are now difficult to access as the television companies have not released them on video or DVD. At the end of the 1980s, he directed some television advertisements for Tennent's Lager to earn money. Days of Hope (1975) is a four part drama for the BBC directed by Loach from scripts by dramatist Jim Allen. The first episode of the series caused considerable controversy in the British media owing to its critical depiction of the military in World War I, and particularly over a scene where conscientious objectors were tied up to stakes outside trenches in view of enemy fire after refusing to obey orders.Days of Hope, Tony Williams, Cinémathèque Annotations on Film, Issue 31, April 2004 An ex-serviceman subsequently contacted The Times newspaper with an illustration from the time of a similar scene. Loach's documentary A Question of Leadership (1981) interviewed members of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (the main trade union for Britain's steel industry) with regards to their 14-week strike in 1980, and recorded much criticism of the union's leadership for conceding over the issues in the strike. Subsequently, Loach made a four-part series named Questions of Leadership which subjected the leadership of other trade unions to similar scrutiny from their members, but this has never been broadcast. Frank Chapple, leader of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, walked out of the interview and made a complaint to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. A separate complaint was made by Terry Duffy of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The series was due to be broadcast during the Trade Union Congress conference in 1983, but Channel 4 decided against broadcasting the series following the complaints. Anthony Hayward claimed in 2004 that the media tycoon Robert Maxwell had put pressure on Central Television's board (Central was the successor to the original production company Associated Television), of which he had become a director, to withdraw Questions of Leadership at the time he was buying the Daily Mirror newspaper and needed the co-operation of union leaders, especially Chapple. Which Side Are You On? (1985), about the songs and poems of the UK miners' strike, was originally due to be broadcast on The South Bank Show, but was rejected on the grounds that it was too politically unbalanced for an arts show. The film was eventually transmitted on Channel 4, but only after it won a prize at an Italian film festival. Three weeks after the end of the strike, the film End of the Battle ... Not the End of the War? was broadcast by Channel 4 in its Diverse Strands series. This film argued that the Conservative Party had planned the destruction of the National Union of Mineworkers' political power from the late 1970s. Working again with Jim Allen, Loach was due to direct Allen's play Perdition at the Royal Court Theatre in 1987. In the play Jewish leaders in Nazi-occupied Hungary allow half a million Jews to be killed in pursuit of a Zionist state in Palestine. However, following protests and allegations of antisemitism, the play was cancelled 36 hours before its premiere. In 1989, Loach directed a short documentary Time to go that called for the British Army to be withdrawn from Northern Ireland, which was broadcast in the BBC's Split Screen series. From the late 1980s, Loach directed theatrical feature films more regularly, a series of films such as Hidden Agenda (1990), dealing with the political troubles in Northern Ireland, Land and Freedom (1995), examining the Republican resistance in the Spanish Civil War and Carla's Song (1996), which was set partially in Nicaragua. He directed the Courtroom Drama reconstructions in the docu-film McLibel, concerning McDonald's Restaurants v Morris & Steel, the longest libel trial in English history. Interspersed with political films were smaller dramas such as Raining Stones (1993) a working- class drama concerning an unemployed man's efforts to buy a communion dress for his young daughter. On 28 May 2006, Loach won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival for his film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a political-historical drama about the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War during the 1920s. Like Hidden Agenda before it, The Wind That Shakes the Barley was criticised for allegedly being too sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army and Provisional Irish Republican Army. This film was followed by It's a Free World... (2007), a story of one woman's attempt to establish an illegal placement service for migrant workers in London. Throughout the 2000s, Loach interspersed wider political dramas such as Bread and Roses (2000), which focused on the Los Angeles janitors strike and Route Irish (2010) set during the Iraq occupation with smaller examinations of personal relationships. Ae Fond Kiss... (aka, Just a Kiss, 2004) explored an inter-racial love affair, Sweet Sixteen (2002) concerns a teenager's relationship with his mother and My Name Is Joe (1998) an alcoholic's struggle to stay sober. His most commercial later film is Looking for Eric (2009), featuring a depressed postman's conversations with the ex-Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona appearing as himself. The film won the Magritte Award for Best Co-Production. Although successful in Manchester, the film was a flop in many other cities, especially cities with rival football teams to Manchester United. A thematic consistency throughout his films, whether they examine broad political situations or smaller intimate dramas, is his focus on personal relationships. The sweeping political dramas (Land and Freedom, Bread and Roses, The Wind that Shakes the Barley) examine wider political forces in the context of relationships between family members (Bread and Roses, The Wind that Shakes the Barley, Carla's Song), comrades in struggle (Land and Freedom) or close friends (Route Irish). In a 2011 interview for the Financial Times, Loach explains how \\"The politics are embedded into the characters and the narrative, which is a more sophisticated way of doing it\\". The Angels' Share (2013) is centred on a young Scottish troublemaker who is given a final opportunity to stay out of jail. Newcomer Paul Brannigan, then 24, from Glasgow, played the lead role. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival where Loach won the Jury Prize. Jimmy's Hall (2014) was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Loach announced his retirement from film-making in 2014 but soon after restarted his career following the election of a Conservative government in the UK general election of 2015.Interview with Loach in Versus: The Life and Films of Ken Loach, BBC Films/BFI, broadcast 30 July 2016. Loach won his second Palme d'Or for I, Daniel Blake (2016). In February 2017, the film was awarded a BAFTA as \\"Outstanding British Film\\". ==Film style== Loach at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival In May 2010, Loach referred in an interview to the three films that have influenced him most: Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948), Miloš Forman's Loves of a Blonde (1965) and Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers (1966). De Sica's film had a particularly profound effect. He noted: \\"It made me realise that cinema could be about ordinary people and their dilemmas. It wasn't a film about stars, or riches or absurd adventures\\". Throughout his career, some of Loach's films have been shelved for political reasons. In a 2011 interview with The Guardian newspaper he said: Loach argues that working people's struggles are inherently dramatic: Many of Loach's films include a large amount of traditional dialect, such as the Yorkshire dialect in Kes and in The Price of Coal, Cockney in Up the Junction and Poor Cow, Scouse in The Big Flame, Lancashire dialect in Raining Stones, Glaswegian in My Name Is Joe and the dialect of Greenock in Sweet Sixteen. Many of these films have been subtitled when shown in other English-speaking countries. When asked about this in an interview with Cineaste, Loach replied: Loach was amongst the first British directors to use swearing in his films. Mary Whitehouse complained about swearing in Cathy Come Home and Up The Junction, while The Big Flame (1969) for the BBC was an early instance of the word shit, and the certificate to Kes caused some debate owing to the profanity, but these films have relatively few swear words compared to his later work. In particular, the film Sweet Sixteen was awarded an 18 certificate on the basis of the very large amount of swearing, despite the lack of serious violence or sexual content, which led Loach to encourage under-18s to break the law to see the film. Feminist writer Julie Bindel has criticised Loach's recent films for a lack of female characters who are not simply love interests for the male characters, although she praised his early film, Cathy Come Home. Bindel also wrote, \\"Loach appears not to know gay people exist\\". ==Political activities== Affiliations before 2015 Loach first joined the Labour Party from the early 1960s. In the 1980s, he was in the Labour Party because of the presence of \\"a radical element that was critical of the leadership\\", but Loach had left the Labour Party by the mid-1990s after being a member for 30 years. During the 1960s and 1970s, he was associated with (or a member of) the Socialist Labour League (later the Workers Revolutionary Party), the International Socialists (later the Socialist Workers Party or SWP) and the International Marxist Group. He was involved in Respect - The Unity Coalition from its beginnings in January 2004, and stood for election to the European Parliament on the Respect list in 2004. Loach was elected to the national council of Respect the following November. When Respect split in 2007, Loach identified with Respect Renewal, the faction identified with George Galloway. Later, his connection with Respect ended. Together with John Pilger and Jemima Khan, Loach was among the six people in court who offered surety for Julian Assange when he was arrested in London on 7 December 2010. The money was forfeited when Assange skipped bail to seek asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador, London. Loach supported the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition in the 2012 London Assembly election. With the support of the activist Kate Hudson and academic Gilbert Achcar, Loach launched a campaign in March 2013 for a new left-wing partyKen Loach, Kate Hudson and Gilbert Achcar \\"The Labour party has failed us. We need a new party of the left\\", The Guardian (London), 25 March 2013 which was founded as Left Unity on 30 November. Left Unity candidates gained an average of 3.2% in the 2014 local elections. Loach gave a press conference during the launch of Left Unity's manifesto for the 2015 general election. Campaign for boycott of Israel In a letter sent to The Guardian in 2009, Loach advocated support for the Palestine Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) along with his regular colleagues Paul Laverty (writer) and Rebecca O'Brien (producer). Loach made an earlier announcement in 2006, see In 2007, Loach was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter calling on the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival \\"to honour calls for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions, by discontinuing Israeli consulate sponsorship of the LGBT film festival and not co-sponsoring events with the Israeli consulate\\".Matthew S. Bajko \\"Political Notebook: Queer activists reel over Israel, Frameline ties\\", Bay Area Reporter, 17 May 2007. Loach also joined \\"54 international figures in the literary and cultural fields\\" in signing a letter that stated, in part, \\"celebrating 'Israel at 60' is tantamount to dancing on Palestinian graves to the haunting tune of lingering dispossession and multi-faceted injustice\\". The letter was published in the International Herald Tribune on 8 May 2008.\\"60 Years of Palestinian Dispossession ... No Reason to Celebrate 'Israel at 60'!\\", Mr Zine (Monthly Review Press) website, 17 May 2008. Responding to a report, which Loach described as \\"a red herring\\", on the growth of antisemitism since the beginning of the Gaza War of 2008–2009, he said: \\"If there has been a rise I am not surprised. In fact, it is perfectly understandable because Israel feeds feelings of anti-Semitism\\". He added that \\"no-one can condone violence\\".\\"EU-wide rise in anti-Semitism described as 'understandable'\\" , EU Politics News, 4 March 2009 Speaking at the launch of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine on 4 March 2009, he asserted that \\"nothing has been a greater instigator of antisemitism than the self-proclaimed Jewish state itself\\". In May 2009, organisers of the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF) returned a £300 grant from the Israeli Embassy after speaking with Loach. He was supporting a boycott of the festival called for by the PACBI campaign. In response, former Channel 4 chief executive Sir Jeremy Isaacs described Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, saying: \\"They must not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming\\". Later, a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned £300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself would fund Israeli filmmaker Tali Shalom Ezer's travel to Edinburgh from its own budget. Edinburgh film festival refuses Israeli grant due to pressure by Ken Loach Haaretz, 20 May 2009. Her film Surrogate (2008) is a comedy set in a sex-therapy clinic which is unconcerned with war or politics. In an open letter to Shalom-Ezer, Loach wrote: \\"From the beginning, Israel and its supporters have attacked their critics as anti-semites or racists. It is a tactic to undermine rational debate. To be crystal clear: as a film maker you will receive a warm welcome in Edinburgh. You are not censored or rejected. The opposition was to the Festival’s taking money from the Israeli state\\".Ahmad, Muhammad. Ken Loach responds to critics, pulsemedia.org, 26 May 2009. To his critics, he added later: \\"The boycott, as anyone who takes the trouble to investigate knows, is aimed at the Israeli state\\". Loach said he had a \\"respectful and reasoned\\" conversation with event organisers, saying they should not be accepting funds from Israel.Ahmad, Muhammad. 'Enough is Enough', say Ken Loach and Ilan Pappe, pulsemedia.org, 18 June 2009. In June 2009, Loach, Laverty and O'Brien withdrew their film Looking For Eric from the Melbourne International Film Festival, where the Israeli Embassy is a sponsor, after the festival declined to withdraw that sponsorship.Israeli funding angers filmmaker by Philippa Hawker, The Age. 18 July 2009. The festival's chief executive, Richard Moore, compared Loach's tactics to blackmail, stating that \\"we will not participate in a boycott against the State of Israel, just as we would not contemplate boycotting films from China or other nations involved in difficult long-standing historical disputes\\". Australian lawmaker Michael Danby also criticised Loach's tactics stating that \\"Israelis and Australians have always had a lot in common, including contempt for the irritating British penchant for claiming cultural superiority. Melbourne is a very different place to Londonistan\\".British director withdraws festival film, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), 19 July 2009. An article in The Scotsman by Alex Massie noted that Loach had not called for the same boycott of the Cannes Film Festival, where his film was in competition with some Israeli films. Loach, Laverty and O'Brien subsequently wrote that: Association with Labour under Jeremy Corbyn Loach is a member of the Labour Party. In August 2015, he endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's Labour leadership campaign. In September 2016, Loach's one-hour documentary In Conversation with Jeremy Corbyn was released during the second leadership election.Ken Loach makes promotional video for Jeremy Corbyn. The Guardian. 19 September 2016. Retrieved 8 October 2016.In Conversation with Jeremy Corbyn. Official Jeremy Corbyn YouTube Channel. 21 September 2016. Retrieved 8 October 2016. In May 2017, he directed an election broadcast featuring a profile of Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour Party's general election campaign. In all, he has made three broadcasts for the party. In interviews in September and October 2019 Loach said MPs around Corbyn had not acted as a team and that most would prefer a rightwing leader. He said the Labour leadership had \\"compromised too much with the Labour right\\". He accused the right of the party, including Tom Watson, of aiming to destroy the socialist programme put forward by Corbyn. He suggested that sitting Labour MP's and councillors should reapply for their jobs before each election so that they could be judged on their record. He also demanded that Labour people make a case for socialism including \\"[en]hancing trade union rights, planning the economy, investing in the regions, kicking out the privatised elements of the NHS\\". He considered issues such as health, schools, poverty, inequality and climate change as more important than Brexit. In November 2019, Loach endorsed the Labour Party in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" Views on allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party At the Labour Party conference in September 2017, Loach said he had been going to Labour Party, trade union and left wing meetings for over 50 years and had never heard anti-Semitic or racist remarks, although such views certainly existed in society. When asked about allegations of antisemitic abuse made by Ruth Smeeth MP, he suggested that they were raised to destabilise Corbyn's leadership, due to his support for Palestinian rights. He was also asked about a conference fringe event at which Miko Peled suggested people should be allowed to question whether the Holocaust had happened. Loach responded: \\"I think history is for all of us to discuss. The founding of the state of Israel, for example, based on ethnic cleansing, is there for us all to discuss, so don't try and subvert that by false stories of antisemitism\\". Following the publication of articles by Jonathan Freedland and Howard Jacobson which were critical of him, he denied that he felt it was acceptable to question the reality of the Holocaust, adding that it was as real a historical event as the Second World War itself and not to be challenged. In April 2018, Loach was reported to have said, at a screening of I, Daniel Blake organised by Kingswood Labour Party, that those Labour MPs who had attended a rally in Parliament Square the previous month opposing alleged antisemitism in the Labour Party should be deselected or, as he reputedly expressed it, \\"kicked out\\" because of their lack of support for the current manifesto. Asked for clarification, Loach said the quoted remarks \\"do not reflect my position\\" and that “Reselecting an MP should not be based on individual incidents but reflect the MP’s principles, actions and behaviour over a long period.” In July 2019, Panorama aired an episode entitled \\"Is Labour Anti-Semitic?\\", in which eight former members of Labour Party staff said that senior Labour figures had intervened to downgrade punishments handed out to members over antisemitism. Loach commented saying \\"it raised the horror of racism against Jews in the most atrocious propagandistic way, with crude journalism … and it bought the propaganda from people who were intent on destroying Corbyn\\". ==Personal life and honours== Loach lives with his wife, Lesley, in Bath. His son Jim Loach has also become a television and film director. A younger son died in a car accident, aged five, and he also has another son and two daughters, one of whom is Emma Loach (born 1972), a documentary film maker who is married to the actor Elliot Levey. Loach is a patron of the British Humanist Association and a secularist, saying \\"In particular, the indoctrination of children in separate faith schools is pernicious and divisive. I strongly support the British Humanist Association.\\" Loach turned down an OBE in 1977. In a Radio Times interview, published in March 2001, he said: Loach has been awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Bath, the University of Birmingham, Staffordshire University, and Keele University. Oxford University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005. He is also an honorary fellow of his alma mater, St Peter's College, Oxford. In May 2006, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship at the BAFTA TV Awards. In 2003, Loach received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University and received the 2003 Praemium Imperiale (lit. \\"World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu\\") in the category Film/Theatre. In 2014, he was presented with the Honorary Golden Bear at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The Raindance Film Festival announced in September 2016 that it would be honouring Loach with its inaugural Auteur Award, to recognise his \\"achievements in filmmaking and contribution to the film industry.\\" He was also made Honorary Associate of London Film School. Turning down Turin Film Festival award In November 2012, Loach turned down the Turin Film Festival award, after learning that the National Museum of Cinema in Turin had outsourced cleaning and security services. As a consequence, workers had been dismissed, while there had been allegations of intimidation and harassment. Some workers lost their jobs after opposing a wage cut. Honorary doctorate from Free University of Brussels In April 2018, Loach was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Université libre de Bruxelles. Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel objected. Belgian Jewish organisations campaigned for Loach not to receive the honorary doctorate. The previous evening, during a speech at Brussels Grand Synagogue, to mark the 70th anniversary of Israel's foundation, Michel said: \\"No accommodation with antisemitism can be tolerated, whatever its form. And that also goes for my own alma mater\\". His office told the Belgian De Standaard news website the comments could apply to Loach's honorary doctorate. At a press conference before the award, Loach asked: \\"Is the law so badly taught here? Or did he not pass his exam?\\" In a press release, Loach said the claim about his alleged antisemitism was \\"malicious\\". The rector of the Free University of Brussels, Yvon Englert, supported Loach. ==Filmography== Television *Catherine (\\"Teletale\\", 1964) *Z-Cars (series episodes, 1964) *Diary of a Young Man (series, 1964) *Tap on the Shoulder (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *Wear a Very Big Hat (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *Three Clear Sundays (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *The End of Arthur's Marriage (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *The Coming Out Party (The Wednesday Play, 1965) *Cathy Come Home (The Wednesday Play, 1966) *In Two Minds (The Wednesday Play, 1967) *The Golden Vision (The Wednesday Play, 1968) *The Big Flame (The Wednesday Play, 1969) *The Rank and File (Play for Today, 1971) *After a Lifetime (\\"Sunday Night Theatre\\", 1971) *A Misfortune (\\"Full House\\", 1973) *Days of Hope (serial, 1975) *The Price of Coal (1977) *The Gamekeeper (1980) *Auditions (1980) *A Question of Leadership (1981) *The Red and the Blue: Impressions of Two Political Conferences – Autumn 1982 (1983) *Questions of Leadership (1983/4, untransmitted) *Which Side Are You On?

Films of his have won the Palme d’Or, the festival's top award, a joint-record twice (The Wind That Shakes the Barley in 2006 and I, Daniel Blake in 2016), the Jury Prize a joint-record three times (Hidden Agenda in 1990, Raining Stones in 1993, and The Angels' Share in 2012) as well as the FIPRESCI Prize three times (Black Jack in 1979, Riff-Raff in 1991 and Land and Freedom in 1995) and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury twice (Land and Freedom in 1995 and Looking for Eric in 2009). Loach's collaborators have also won awards at the festival for their work on his films: Peter Mullan won Best Actor for My Name Is Joe in 1998, and Paul Laverty won Best Screenplay for Sweet Sixteen in 2002. While Loach's films have only occasionally been entered into the Venice and Berlin Film Festivals (generally regarded as the main rivals of Cannes), he has won awards at both, including, most notably, their respective lifetime achievement awards: the Honorary Golden Lion in 1994, and the Honorary Golden Bear in 2014. Other major awards won by Loach include the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film (I, Daniel Blake in 2016) and BIFA Award for Best British Independent Film (My Name is Joe in 1998 and Sweet Sixteen in 2002), the Cesar Award for Best Foreign Film (Land and Freedom in 1995 and I, Daniel Blake in 2016), the European Film Award for Best Film (Riff-Raff in 1992 and Land and Freedom in 1995), and the Belgian Film Critics Association Grand Prix (Raining Stones in 1993). In addition, Loach's 1969 classic Kes was judged the 7th best British film of the 20th century by the British Film Institute, and the 4th best British film ever made by Time Out, while his 1966 television play Cathy Come Home was ranked the second best British TV programme, also by the BFI, and the best ever single television drama in a readers' poll conducted by the Radio Times. Loach's 1997/2005 documentary McLibel, meanwhile, featured in the BFI's landmark Ten Documentaries which Changed the World series. ==See also== * Kitchen sink realism ==References * Ken Loach – Production Company and DVD box set * * * Ken Loach at MUBI * Ken Loach Filmography * Extensive Ken Loach Biography and Filmography * Interview with Loach about My Name is Joe * Interview with Loach from 1998 * Posters and Stills Gallery from the BFI * Interview: Ken Loach about Media, Culture and the Prospects for a New Liberatory Project, Democracy & Nature, Vol. 5, No.1 (March 1999).

She led the Birmingham Stop the War Coalition and is a patron of Stop the War Coalition UK. She unsuccessfully stood to be the Labour Party candidate for Mayor of the West Midlands in the 2021 mayoral election, finishing third out of three candidates. She has been a spokesperson for Birmingham Central Mosque. Yaqoob has also contributed to news outlets, including HuffPost, The Guardian and New Statesman. ==Early life== Yaqoob's parents, Mohammad and Gulzarda Yaqoob, emigrated to the UK from Pakistan in the 1960s, and her father worked in a mill before joining the Royal Mail.Ann McFerran (22 July 2007) \\"Relative values: Salma Yaqoob and her father Mohammad\\", timesonline.co.uk; accessed 15 April 2017. Yaqoob was born in Bradford on 15 August 1971: the family later moved to Birmingham, where she was raised. She describes herself as having been a \\"tomboyish girl\\" who played football on the streets of Alum Rock. Yaqoob became politically active after the September 11 attacks. She claims to have been spat at on the streets of Birmingham in the days following the attacks. ==Professional career== Yaqoob runs a part-time psychotherapy practice. She is employed as a Community Engagement Senior Manager at the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. In April 2014, she was appointed Independent Chair of the Stakeholder Council of Birmingham South Central Clinical Commissioning Group. ==Political career== Respect 2005 general election In the 2005 general election, she stood as the Respect candidate for the Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath constituency against Labour's Roger Godsiff MP, with the backing of the Muslim Association of Britain.Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) published 8 April 2005, titled 'The General Elections; Guidelines and Recommendations' She finished in second place, ahead of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates, and with 27.5% of the total vote. 2006 elected as Respect councillor Yaqoob was elected with 49.4% of the vote in the Sparkbrook ward of Birmingham City Council in the 2006 local elections. She was re-elected to the post in May 2010. 2010 general election Yaqoob stood in the 2010 general election for the Respect Party in the Birmingham Hall Green constituency, and came second to Roger Godsiff of the Labour Party, trailing by 3,799 votes. Yaqoob gained 13.9% of the vote, chiefly from the Labour incumbent -- the Labour candidate lost 11.7% of the total vote, election-to-election.Election 2010 result – Birmingham Hall Green, BBC.co.uk; retrieved 7 May 2010. The Green Party had stood down its candidate in favour of Yaqoob after a members' vote. She was endorsed by the then-leader of the Green Party Caroline Lucas and the retiring Labour MP for Birmingham Selly Oak, Lynne Jones. In 2011 Yaqoob claimed to have been offered a choice of two 'safe seats' by the Labour Party, one in Birmingham and one in the Black Country, in the lead-up to the 2010 general election. She stated she had declined the offer. Yaqoob became the leader of the Respect Party, making her the only Muslim female leader of a Parliamentary political party in British history. Council ceremony in 2011 At a Birmingham City Council meeting in early February 2011, Yaqoob and another Respect party councillor, Mohammed Ishtiaq, sat with their arms folded and refused to participate in a standing ovation at a meeting at which Britain's most highly decorated serving marine and Afghanistan veteran Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, GC, RMR was a guest. This led to widespread criticism from other councillors, including allegations that it was a disrespectful act. The two councillors argued they were protesting against \\"false patriotism\\" by politicians, while defending their own history of support of individual troops. Martin Mullaney, a Liberal Democrat councillor, alleged afterwards that Yaqoob would have applauded if it were the 21 July failed bombers who were being honoured. He later apologised for this claim. Media appearances for Respect Yaqoob has made six appearances on the panel of BBC One's Question Time programme. Her first appearance was in Skegness, 19 January 2006, shortly before her election as a councillor. She returned in Preston (October 2006), followed by her home town of Birmingham on 8 February 2007 and Bath on 12 February 2009. On 10 December 2009, Question Time was held in Wootton Bassett, a town where the bodies of UK troops killed in Afghanistan pass through and are informally mourned. Salma Yaqoob stated that she \\"would be proud to have my sons defend this country\\" and argued for better support for UK troops and their withdrawal from Afghanistan. She made her sixth appearance on the show on Thursday 10 June 2010, when it was broadcast from Plymouth. She was joined on the panel by Ben Bradshaw, Jeremy Hunt, Katie Hopkins and Toby Young. Yaqoob has also made appearances on The Politics Show, This Week, Daily Politics, 10 O'Clock Live, and Frost Over The World. Independent Resignation as councillor and leaving Respect On 7 July 2011, Yaqoob announced her intention to stand down as a Birmingham City councillor, citing health reasons. On 11 September 2012, Yaqoob announced her resignation from the Respect party after what she described as a difficult few weeks and a breakdown in relations. Yaqoob had distanced herself from comments made by George Galloway about rape and the allegations made against Julian Assange. In an interview with Aida Edemariam of The Guardian, Yaqoob said that she was being forced into making a \\"false choice\\" between Galloway's \\"anti-imperialist stances\\" and defending women's rights. The Green MP Caroline Lucas and Labour MP Richard Burden publicly offered their support to Yaqoob. In December 2015, it was reported that Yaqoob had applied to become a Labour Party member in Hall Green. The local constituency executive committee refused her membership, since she had previously stood against Labour candidates. Hands off Birmingham schools Yaqoob co-led the \\"Hands off Birmingham schools\\" group, which was set up in 2014 in response to Operation Trojan Horse. Iain Duncan Smith \\"scrounger\\" comment In 2014 episode of Question Time which went viral online, Yaqoob called the then-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith \\"patronising\\" for his views on poverty. She also said that Duncan Smith \\"labels poor people as scroungers when [he] claim[s] £39 for a breakfast\\" and \\"live[s] on [his] wife's estate and [has] taken a million pounds of taxpayers' money, that's what I call scrounging\\". Duncan Smith denied claiming the money for his breakfast or labelling poor people as \\"scroungers\\". 2017 general election Yaqoob stood in the 2017 general election as an independent candidate in the Bradford West constituency. She came third with 13.9% of the votes, 2.7% behind the second-placed Conservative Party candidate. Her standing was mired in controversy, after complaints by Labour HQ about her use of photographs of her with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and her claims that she is a pro-Corbyn candidate. Responding to the complaint, Yaqoob stated that \\"at no point in the leaflet do I make the claim of an endorsement from Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour Party.\\" A spokesperson for the party later clarified that \\"there is only one Labour Party candidate in Bradford West and that is Naz Shah.\\" In response, Yaqoob claimed that the statements made by Labour constituted \\"malicious accusations\\" and said that Shah was playing a \\"petty political game\\". Labour Party 2020 West Midlands Mayoral Candidacy In September 2019, Yaqoob announced that she had applied for the Labour Party (UK) candidacy for Mayor of the West Midlands in the 2020 West Midlands mayoral election, an executive position responsible for the metropolitan county of the West Midlands. The current position is held by Conservative Andy Street. Her campaign for the candidacy is framed around progressivism, anti-austeritism and the Green New Deal. Yaqoob's application was criticized in leaked emails written by Labour MP Naz Shah published in October 2019. In them, Shah stated that Yaqoob was 'unfit for office' following the 2017 campaign in which she stood against her, with Shah concluding: \\"I believe she endorsed misogyny, patriarchy and biradri politics\\". Yaqoob denied running such a campaign but issued a statement stating that: \\"I did not run or endorse a campaign of misogyny, patriarchy and clan politics. Even as a political opponent I showed her respect as a woman and a public figure\\". In the Guardian article Yaqoob said: \\"As shadow equalities and women minister, I would hope Naz Shah would welcome the principle of women coming forward for political office – even those she disagrees with. I am saddened that she is lobbying nationally to limit the right of local Labour members to make their own choice by seeking to remove me from even a potential shortlist.\\" Yaqoob retained the support of Momentum head Jon Lansman, and was eventually endorsed by Momentum. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/labour-mayoral-candidate- calls-for-truce-in-row-with-naz-shah ==Death threats== Yaqoob has received death threats from Islamist and far right extremists. In 2005, she faced harassment and death threats from al Ghurabaa, an extremist-Islamist group later banned under the Terrorism Act 2006. Al-Ghurabaa claimed that it is apostasy for Muslims to participate in Western elections, and its members defaced her election posters with the word \\"Kafir\\". Yaqoob believed she was being targeted for being a Muslim woman in the public eye and for working with churches and synagogues. In August 2009, Birmingham man Stuart Collins appeared in court charged with threatening to kill Yaqoob and with racially and religiously aggravated harassment. In 2013, she was threatened with having her throat cut in an online article which talked about \\"smashing Pakistani people, taking a nail bomb into a Mosque and rioting in Birmingham\\" and said: \\"If that Salma Yaqeubs (sic) there, cut her f*****g throat.\\" ==Personal life== Yaqoob married her first husband Dr Aqil Chaudary, a GP, in 1996; they have three sons. Her family are supporters of Arsenal F.C.\\"Booktopia: Salma Yaqoob\\", RedPepper.org; accessed 8 October 2016.\\"Profile: Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob\\", BBC News, 8 April 2010.\\"The Lutz Report... on Salma Yaqoob\\", TheStirrer.co.uk; accessed 8 October 2016. ==Recognition== In 2006, Yaqoob received the Lloyds TSB Asian Jewel Award for Public Service Excellence while Harper's Bazaar magazine named her in the top thirty list of British women, alongside Kate Winslet, all of whom they considered to be 'women shaping Britain'. In 2008, she was voted to eleventh place in the Birmingham Posts Power 50 list of the most influential people in the city. She was included in the newspaper's list again in 2009. They called her \\"a doughty fighter for inner city areas\\". During this year, she was also included in The Daily Telegraph's annual list of 'Top 100 left wingers'. In 2009, Yaqoob was included in the Muslim Women Power List run by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in association with The Times and Emel magazine. In 2010, The Guardian newspaper in 2010, said Yaqoob was \\"the most prominent Muslim woman in British public life\\". In January 2015, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Birmingham City University. ==See also== List of British Pakistanis ==ReferencesSources== * Solidarity in Practice, Salma Yaqoob (p. 60, Stop the War: The story of Britain's biggest mass movement, Andrew Murray and Lindsey German, ) ==External links== * Salma Yaqoob official website * Birmingham Respect – Salma Yaqoob news * Salma Yaqoob official gallery * The Guardian, Comment is Free: Salma Yaqoob * Interview with Democracy Now!

MAB has been well known for its participation in the protests opposing the Iraq War. More recently, it has been known for promoting Muslim participation in Britain.bestofbritishmuslims.com It is a member organisation of the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe (FIOE). The newly elected president in 2018 is Anas Altikriti, who is the CEO and founder of The Cordoba Foundation. Prior to him, Dr Omer El-Hamdoon headed the organisation for six and a half years. ==Vision== The vision of the Muslim Association of Britain is: \\"Muslims At Their Best.\\"http://www.mabonline.net/about-mab/ ==Anti-war activities== Along with Stop the War Coalition (StWC) and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, it has co-sponsored various demonstrations against the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq. MAB first started working with the StWC in 2002 when they agreed to join together a demonstration they had planned to mark the anniversary of the Second Palestinian Intifada with a demonstration StWC had planned against the looming Iraq war at the opening of the Labour Party. The march took place under the dual slogans 'Don't attack Iraq' and 'Freedom for Palestine'.Unity with MAB, in Stop the War: The story of Britain's biggest mass movement, Andrew Murray and Lindsey German, P. 81–89 According to Altikriti, MAB \\"spoke to Stop the War and we said to them 'We will join you; however we will not become part of your coalition, we will be a separate and independent entity but we will work together with you on a national basis as part of the anti-war movement.' \\"2008 Institute of Race Relations Vol. 50(2): 101–113 == Muslim Brotherhood ties == The group is reported to have had direct ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, the later has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government since 2001. In the past, MAB openly identified itself as an Islamist movement. In MAB's Inspire newspaper, produced for the 28 September 2002 anti-war demonstration, an article on the MAB's “Historical Roots and Background” links it explicitly to the Islamist tradition of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the UK Stop the War Coalition conference in January 2003, the Alliance for Workers' Liberty moved a motion to dissociate from MAB. A MAB speaker, replying, said that MAB was proud to be associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Anas Altikriti, replying in The Times (17 August 2004) to allegations that MAB is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, described MAB as \\"an independent British organisation\\" but admitted \\"links\\" with the Brotherhood, which he described as follows: \\"Links with others extend simply to shared ideas, values and expertise, in which the Brotherhood is indeed rich, with around eight decades of experience.\\" According to Paul Goodman in The Daily Telegraph, MAB's founder Dr Kamal Helbawy admitted in 2005 “to still being a member of the Brotherhood and has been denied entry to America. It has also been alleged that Dr Azzam Tamimi, its leader, issued communiqués on behalf of Hamas during the 1990s. His views on suicide bombing are unambiguous. Asked if he would carry out such an attack in Israel, he said: ‘Sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause. It is the straight way to pleasing God and I would do it if I had the opportunity.’” ==Political endorsements== It encourages its members to vote certain ways in elections—it supported Labour's Ken Livingstone for Mayor of London, Respect in London and the Green Party of England and Wales in South East England. In 2004, its president Anas al-Tikriti stood down to become a European election candidate for Respect in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. He was not elected. ==Reaction to 2005 London bombings== MAB condemned the 7 July 2005 London bombings and joined the StWC in holding a vigil for the victims at the Peace Garden in Euston, London on Saturday, 9 July 2005 and a further solidarity gathering at Russell Square, close to one of the Underground stations targeted, on Sunday, 17 July 2005.Anti-war vigil attracts hundreds, BBC, 17 July 2005 ==Other activities== In late 2002, the Muslim Association of Britain organised a speaking tour in the UK for Anwar al-Awlaki, including events at the London School of Economics, Imperial College, King’s College and the School of Oriental and African Studies. Al- Awlaki was later killed in a drone strike by the United States. In 2005, the MAB took control of Finsbury Park Mosque and expelled followers of the extremist cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri whom they accused of \\"promoting hatred\\". The MAB opposed the US extradition request for Babar Ahmad, a UK IT specialist who was accused of operating websites which offered support to the then Taliban government in Afghanistan. In May 2014, MAB condemned the kidnappings of school girls by Boko Haram.http://www.mabonline.net/images/docs/1399542946Press%20Release%20-%20Nigeria%20Kidnapping.pdf In November 2014, the organisation was listed as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. MAB expressed \\"total and utter condemnation\\" at this action. It further challenged the UAE government to produce any evidence to support its claim, which it has yet to do. In early 2015, MAB’s vice president, Mohammed Kozbar, urged the government to acknowledge that British foreign policy is a contributing factor to radicalism and that marginalising and criminalising young British Muslims is actually more likely to push them towards terrorist groups like ISIS. On 27 February 2016 MAB joined the CND rally against Trident. ==2015 Government report== In 2014, a classified UK Government Review into the Muslim Brotherhood commissioned by then Prime Minister David Cameron concluded that while the Muslim Brotherhood have preferred “non-violent incremental change” this is largely “on the grounds of expediency, often on the basis that political opposition will disappear when the process of Islamisation is complete.” The Review found that the Brotherhood “are prepared to countenance violence – including, from time to time, terrorism - where gradualism is ineffective” and have “deliberately, wittingly and openly incubated and sustained an organisation - Hamas - whose military wing has been proscribed in the UK as a terrorist organisation... Some leading Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters have endorsed attacks on western forces.”https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486932/Muslim_Brotherhood_Review_Main_Findings.pdf The report concluded that \\"for some years the Muslim Brotherhood... dominated the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB)... MAB became politically active, notably in connection with Palestine and Iraq, and promoted candidates in national and local elections...\\" The report acknowledges that MAB have publicly distanced themselves from the Muslim Brotherhood, but that privately the group seems to remain sympathetic to the Brotherhood: \\"The MAB appears much less active than it was between 2002 and 2006. It has little political profile and no obvious connection with groups which have recently arrived from Egypt or the UAE. In 2014 MAB claimed a membership of just 600 people and maintains eight welfare houses (first established here in the 1960s) and associated mosques. It has nine UK branches. MAB has links to the Cordoba Foundation, a think tank which is associated with the Brotherhood (though claiming to be neither affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood nor a lobby organisation for it)....\\" The government report criticises MAB for failing to significantly revise its internal literature to disassociate and disavow Islamist ideology: \\"In their written submission to the review MAB stated that it supported social integration and encouraged young people to be active and responsible citizens. There is some evidence that MAB have tried to do so in specific areas of the country. But as of July 2014 neither MAB nor other organisations related to the Muslim Brotherhood had clearly and publicly promoted a vision of Muslims living in this country as integrated British citizens; indeed, in the course of the preparation of this review MAB accepted that their teaching material has not been updated to reflect their claimed objectives. Literature in the Muslim Brotherhood movement in this country continues to reflect some of the concerns of the foundational Muslim Brotherhood ideology, notably that western society is inherently hostile to Muslim faith and interests and that Muslims must respond by maintaining their distance and autonomy.\\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486932/Muslim_Brotherhood_Review_Main_Findings.pdf In 2015, the UK government published an extract from a report on the Brotherhood commissioned by the UK Cabinet Office by Dr Lorenzo Vidini, Director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Vidini's report claimed that the Brotherhood conducted \\"entryist\\" tactics to influence host societies. The report described MAB as an affiliate of the Brotherhood and described the Brotherhood's entryist tactics as follows: * \\"Spread their religious and political views to British Muslim communities\\" * \\"Become official or de facto representatives of British Muslim communities in the eyes of the government and the media\\" * \\"Support domestic and international Islamist causes with local Muslim communities and British policy-makers and public\\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/downloads/MB%20in%20the%20UK.pdf Muslim Association of Britain president Omer El-Hamdoon said that the MAB had no links to the Brotherhood. El-Hamdoon claimed that the government's accusations were politically motivated, as his organization had criticised Cameron's foreign policy on Iraq. ==Other activities== During February 2016 and 2017, the Muslim Association of Britain joined FOSIS in a nationwide campaign called \\"Believe and Do Good\\". The campaign was carried out with over 60 Islamic societies throughout the UK. ==References * Category:Religious activism Category:Islamic organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Islamic organizations established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Muslim Association of Britain"},{"id":"46398954","text":"Orthodox Trotskyism is a branch of Trotskyism which aims to adhere more closely to the philosophy, methods and positions of Leon Trotsky and the early Fourth International, Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx than other Trotskyists. The first Trotskyist international to describe itself as orthodox Trotskyist was the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). Shortly after its formation in 1953, it wrote an open letter in which it described the tradition of the Fourth International as orthodox Trotskyism and called for orthodox Trotskyists to rally to the ICFI.\\"A Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World\\". Orthodox Trotskyism embodied their opposition to the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI), whose policies they described as \\"Pabloism\\". The ICFI claimed that it alone defended the principles of the Fourth International while the \\"Pabloites\\" subordinated the international workers movement to the bureaucracies or bourgeois leaders.Bill Vann. \\"Bill Vann replies to a member of the International Socialist Organization\\". The subsequent history of orthodox Trotskyism is essentially that of the ICFI. Its largest section, the American Socialist Workers Party, left to join the \\"Pabloites\\" in 1963, eventually breaking with Trotskyism altogether in the 1980s, although a section remained loyal to the ICFI and are today the Socialist Equality Party.\\"The Historical and International Foundations of the Socialist Equality Party—Part 7\\". The orthodox Trotskyists suffered another split in 1973 between the Socialist Labour League (SLL) of Gerry Healy and the Internationalist Communist Organisation (OCI) of Pierre Lambert. The official explanation for the split was that the OCI believed that orthodox Trotskyism should be based on Trosky's Transitional Programme while the SLL held that as the Transitional Programme was merely the outcome of Trotsky's application of Marxist dialectics, it was possible and even necessary to revise Trotsky's programme as the objective situation changed.Bob Pitt. \\"The Rise and Fall of Gerry Healy\\". A French section returned to the ICFI in 2016 as the Socialist Equality Party (France) (PES).\\"The International Committee of the Fourth International founds its French section\\". Today, the surviving ICFI continue to characterise their politics as orthodox Trotskyism. Other groups have come to orthodox Trotskyism from different backgrounds and either like the International Trotskyist Committee believe that the ICFI later degenerated,\\"The Founding Documents of the International Trotskyist Committee\\". or like the Liaison Committee of Militants for a Revolutionary Communist International that the ICFI never represented healthy orthodox Trotskyism, but that they support the early Fourth International and its approach in a similar manner.José Villa. \\"Ten Years of the LRCI\\". Many orthodox Trotskyist groups attach particular importance in holding that the Soviet Union was a degenerated workers' state and other similar societies are deformed workers' states. However, many other Trotskyist groups which have not described themselves as orthodox Trotskyist also hold this view. Orthodox Trotskyism has been critiqued by activists from the third camp socialist tradition and from the International Socialist Tendency. Max Shachtman of the Workers Party was describing the Fourth International as orthodox Trotskyist by 1948.Max Shachtman. \\"An Analysis of the Bankruptcy of \\"Orthodox Trotskyism\\". The IST similarly criticises both the ICFI and the ISFI traditions as orthodox Trotskyist.Alex Callinicos. \\"Trotskyism\\". == References == Category:Trotskyism Category:Marxist theory Category:Types of socialism ","title":"Orthodox Trotskyism"},{"id":"46398956","text":"The σ-π model and equivalent-orbital model refer to two possible representations of molecules in valence bond theory. The σ-π model differentiates bonds and lone pairs of σ symmetry from those of π symmetry, while the equivalent-orbital model hybridizes them. The σ-π treatment takes into account molecular symmetry and is better suited to interpretation of aromatic molecules (Hückel's rule), although computational calculations of certain molecules tend to optimize better under the equivalent-orbital treatment.. The two representations produce the same total electron density and are related by a unitary transformation of the occupied molecular orbitals; different localization procedures yield either of the two. Two equivalent orbitals h and h' can be constructed by taking linear combinations h = c1σ + c2π and h' = c1σ – c2π for an appropriate choice of coefficients c1 and c2. In a 1996 review, Kenneth B. Wiberg concluded that \\"although a conclusive statement cannot be made on the basis of the currently available information, it seems likely that we can continue to consider the σ/π and bent-bond descriptions of ethylene to be equivalent.. Ian Fleming goes further in a 2010 textbook, noting that \\"the overall distribution of electrons [...] is exactly the same\\" in the two models.. Nevertheless, as pointed out in Carroll's textbook, at lower levels of theory, the two models make different quantitative and qualitative predictions, and there has been considerable debate as to which model is most useful conceptually and pedagogically. ==Multiple bonds== Two different explanations for the nature of double and triple covalent bonds in organic molecules were proposed in the 1930s. Linus Pauling proposed that the double bond in ethylene results from two equivalent tetrahedral orbitals from each atom,. which later came to be called banana bonds or tau bonds.. Erich Hückel proposed a representation of the double bond as a combination of a sigma bond plus a pi bond.. The σ-π representation is the better-known one, and it is the one found in most textbooks since the late-20th century. ==Multiple lone pairs== The symmetry-adapted and hybridized lone pairs of H2O Initially, Linus Pauling's scheme of water as presented in his hallmark paper on valence bond theory consists of two inequivalent lone pairs of σ and π symmetry. As a result of later developments resulting partially from the introduction of VSEPR, an alternative view arose which considers the two lone pairs to be equivalent, colloquially called rabbit ears. Weinhold and Landis describe the symmetry adapted use of the orbital hybridization concept within the context of natural bond orbitals, a localized orbital theory containing modernized analogs of classical (valence bond/Lewis structure) bonding pairs and lone pairs. For the hydrogen fluoride molecule, for example, two F lone pairs are essentially unhybridized p orbitals of π symmetry, while the other is an spx hydrid orbital of σ symmetry. An analogous consideration applies to water (one O lone pair is in a pure p orbital, another is in an spx hybrid orbital). The question of whether it is conceptually useful to derive equivalent orbitals from symmetry-adapted ones, from the standpoint of bonding theory and pedagogy, is still a controversial one, with recent (2014 and 2015) articles opposing and supporting the practice. == References == Category:Chemical bonding ","title":"Sigma-pi and equivalent-orbital models"},{"id":"46398965","text":"The following is a list of Trotskyist organizations by country.

Controversy  On 23 August 2011, transport workers loyal to Khan snatched newspapers from hawkers and transport vehicles because the newspapers criticized the role Khan played in granting driving licenses. He has been criticised for defending drivers violating traffic laws. As the Minister of Shipping, he defended chief engineer of the Department of Shipping AKM Fakhrul Islam and protected him from departmental action. Islam was arrested on 11 August 2017 by Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission with half a million taka in bribe. He has supported CBA leaders at Bangladesh Bank worrying officers at the bank. He was criticised over the recruitment at Chittagong port by government MP Moin Uddin Khan Badal and opposition party MP Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu. On 29 July 2018, Khan was criticized for commenting lightheartedly with a smiley face about a road accident which led to the death of at least two students. Following his remark, countrywide protests and road blockades were held by the students demanding a sincere apology. He later apologised for his remarks. ==Personal life== Khan has been married to Syeda Rokeya Begum since 1984. She is a daughter of journalist Syed Golam Kibria. Khan has two sons and one daughter. Eldest of them Asib Khan is an Advocate and likely to take over his fathers(Khans) position after Khan. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:People from Madaripur District Category:Awami League politicians Category:Shipping ministers of Bangladesh Category:Liberation War Affairs ministers of Bangladesh Category:8th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:9th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:10th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:11th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:3rd Jatiya Sangsad members Category:7th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:5th Jatiya Sangsad members ","title":"Shajahan Khan"},{"id":"46398998","text":"A united front is an alliance of groups against their common enemies, figuratively evoking unification of previously separate geographic fronts and/or unification of previously separate armies into a front—the name often refers to a political and/or military struggle carried out by revolutionaries, especially in revolutionary socialism, communism or anarchism. The basic theory of the united front tactic among socialists was first developed by the Comintern, an international communist organization created by communists in the wake of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. According to the thesis of the 1922 4th World Congress of the Comintern: > The united front tactic is simply an initiative whereby the Communists > propose to join with all workers belonging to other parties and groups and > all unaligned workers in a common struggle to defend the immediate, basic > interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie.. The united front allowed workers committed to the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism to struggle alongside non-revolutionary workers. Through these common struggles, revolutionaries sought to win other workers to revolutionary socialism. The united front perspective is also used in contemporary and non- Leninist perspectives.Dan Jakopovich, \\"In the Belly of the Beast: Challenging US Imperialism and the Politics of the Offensive\\" , CC-DS ==History== According to Russian communist Leon Trotsky, the roots of the united front go back to the practice of the Bolshevik Party during the 1917 Russian Revolution.. The Comintern generalised that experience among the fledgling Communist Parties that were established or grew significantly during the years after 1917. The theory of the united front was elaborated at the 3rd and the 4th Congresses of the Comintern, held from November 5 to December 5, 1922. Revolutionary socialists represented a minority in the working class, and the united front offered a method of working with large numbers of non- revolutionary workers and simultaneously winning them to revolutionary politics. The strategy was used by leaders after the initial revolutionary tide since 1917 began to ebb. According to the leaders of the Comintern, the shift from offensive to defensive struggles by workers strengthened the desire for united action within the working class. The leaders hoped that the united front would allow the revolutionaries to win a majority inside the class: > The task of the Communist Party is to lead the proletarian revolution. In > order to summon the proletariat for the direct conquest of power and to > achieve it the Communist Party must base itself on the overwhelming majority > of the working class.... So long as it does not hold this majority, the > party must fight to win it.. The revolutionaries were told to maintain independence: > The existence of independent Communist Parties and their complete freedom of > action in relation to the bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionary social > democracy.... In the same way the united front tactic has nothing to do with > the so-called 'electoral combinations' of leaders in pursuit of one or > another parliamentary aim. The united front tactic is simply an initiative > whereby the communists propose to join with all workers belonging to other > parties and groups and all unaligned workers in a common struggle to defend > the immediate, basic interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie. However, revolutionaries could not simply go over the heads of the leaders of reformist organizations. They should approach those leaders demanding unity on the bases of a united front. That would pose a dilemma for the reformist leaders: to refuse the invitation and be seen by their followers as an obstacle to unity or to accept the invitation and be required to operate on the terrain of mass struggle (strikes, protests etc.) on which the revolutionaries would be proved to have superior ideas and methods. The tactic was put into practice in Germany in 1922 and 1923 and, for a time, was effective in winning workers to revolutionary socialism.See also Florian Wilde: Building a Mass Party: Ernst Meyer and the United Front Policy 1921-1922, in: Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart 2017. As Stalinism came to dominate the Comintern, the strategy was dropped. In the Comintern's Third Period from 1928, the period preceding Adolf Hitler's victories in German elections, the Comintern argued that the social democrats were \\"social fascists\\" and, rather than the Nazis, represented the real danger. After Hitler's 1933 victory, the Comintern argued for popular fronts drawing in forces far beyond the working-class movement. Trotsky, now exiled from the Soviet Union, argued that the first conclusion was disastrous because it prevented unity against the far right and that the second, by emphasizing popular fronts, was disastrous because the terms of the struggle would be dictated by mainstream liberal parties. He feared that the communists would have to subordinate their politics within the alliance. Trotsky continued to argue for a workers' united front against fascism. Trotsky argued that the united front strategy would have great appeal to workers who wished to fight fascism: > The programme of action must be strictly practical, strictly objective, to > the point, without any of those artificial 'claims', without any > reservations, so that every average Social Democratic worker can say to > himself: what the Communists propose is completely indispensable for the > struggle against fascism. On this basis we must pull the Social Democratic > workers along with us by our example, and criticize their leaders who will > inevitably serve as a check and a break.. In Chinese history, during the First United Front (1924–1927) was the Communist Party of China worked closely with the nationalist Kuomintang. The Chinese organized a Second United Front (1937–1943) to fight the Japanese during World War II. Currently, the United Front Work Department manages relations between the Communist Party of China and other parties, such as the pro-Beijing parties in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas. In Vietnam, the Vietcong organized the National Liberation Front (1960–1977) to gather widespread support for the independence struggle, first against France and then against the United States during the Vietnam War. Trotsky and Trotskyists, such as Harold Isaacs in his The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution, would argue that they were popular fronts, not united fronts, that were based upon the model used by the Bolsheviks in 1917 and later. In West Bengal, India, a United Front (Bengali: যুক্তফ্রণ্ট) was formed shortly after the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. It was conceived on 25 February 1967, through the joining together of the United Left Front and the People's United Left Front, along with other parties. The front comprised the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Samyukta Socialist Party, the Socialist Unity Centre of India, the Marxist Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Communist Party of India, the Workers Party of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Communist Party of India, the Bangla Congress, the All India Forward Bloc and the Bolshevik Party of India. Soon after its formation, a massive rally was held in Calcutta, at which an 18-point programme of the Front was presented. Ajoy Mukherjee, leader of the Bangla Congress, was the head of the United Front. It dislodged the Indian National Congress in the state of West Bengal for the first time. ==See also== * Entryism * Eurocommunism * Left communism * Popular Front * Third Period * Confucius Institute ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Florian Wilde: Building a Mass Party: Ernst Meyer and the United Front Policy 1921-1922, in: Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart 2017. pp. 66-86. *The United Front by Joseph Choonara in International Socialism 117 (2007) *On the United Front tactic by Duncan Hallas in International Socialism (1976) *The United Front by Lindsey German (1984) *The United Front by Pete Goodwin in International Socialism (1978) * Category:Communist terminology Category:Trotskyism ","title":"United front"},{"id":"46399007","text":"International Socialism is a British-based quarterly journal established in 1960 and published in London by the Socialist Workers Party which discusses socialist theory.

It is based on the theory that capitalism is a world-system and therefore the working classes of all nations must act in concert if they are to replace it with communism. Proponents of proletarian internationalism often argued that the objectives of a given revolution should be global rather than local in scope—for example, triggering or perpetuating revolutions elsewhere. Proletarian internationalism is closely linked to goals of world revolution, to be achieved through successive or simultaneous communist revolutions in all nations. According to Marxist theory, successful proletarian internationalism should lead to world communism and eventually stateless communism.N.I. Bukharin, Marx's Teaching and its Historical Importance, Chapter 4: The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism in Nikolai Bukharin and Others, Marxism and Modern Thought (George Routledge & Sons Ltd., 1935), page 1-90.Vladimir Lenin, The State and Revolution: The Marxist Theory of the State & the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution (1918), Chapter V: The Economic Basis of the Withering Away of the State, Collected Works, Volume 25, p. 381-492 The notion was strongly embraced by the first communist party, the Communist League, as exercised through its slogan \\"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\\", later popularized as \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" in English literature. Proletarian internationalism was originally embraced by the Bolshevik Party during its seizure of power in the Russian Revolution. After the formation of the Soviet Union, Marxist proponents of internationalism suggested that country could be used as a \\"homeland of communism\\" from which revolution could be spread around the globe. Though world revolution continued to figure prominently in Soviet rhetoric for decades, it no longer superseded domestic concerns on the government's agenda, especially after the ascension of Joseph Stalin. Despite this, the Soviet Union continued to foster international ties with communist and left-wing parties and governments around the world. It played a fundamental role in the establishment of several socialist states in Eastern Europe after World War II and backed the creation of others in Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Soviets also funded dozens of insurgencies being waged against non-communist governments by leftist guerrilla movements worldwide. A few other states later exercised their own commitments to the cause of world revolution—for instance, Cuba frequently dispatched internationalist military missions abroad to defend communist interests in Africa and the Caribbean. == Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels == Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, \\"Workers of all countries, unite!\\", the last line of The Communist Manifesto, published in 1848. However, Marx and Engels' approach to the national question was also shaped by tactical considerations in their pursuit of a long-term revolutionary strategy. In 1848, the proletariat was a small minority in all but a handful of countries.Citation needed Political and economic conditions needed to ripen in order to advance the possibility of proletarian revolution. For instance, Marx and Engels supported the emergence of an independent and democratic Poland, which at the time was divided between Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary. Rosa Luxemburg's biographer Peter Nettl writes: \\"In general, Marx and Engels' conception of the national-geographical rearrangement of Europe was based on four criteria: the development of progress, the creation of large-scale economic units, the weighting of approval and disapproval in accordance with revolutionary possibilities, and their specific enmity to Russia\\".J.P Nettl, \\"Rosa Luxemburg\\", Oxford University Press 1969. Nettl is quoting Hans-Ulrich Wehler's study, \\"Sozialdemokratie and Nationalstaat\\" (Würzburg, 1962) Russia was seen as the heartland of European reaction at the time. == First International == The trade unionists who formed the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), sometimes called the First International, recognised that the working class was an international class which had to link its struggle on an international scale. By joining together across national borders, the workers would gain greater bargaining power and political influence. Founded in 1864, the IWA was the first mass movement with a specifically international focus. At its peak, the IWA had 5 million members according to police reports from the various countries in which it had a significant presence.Payne, Robert. \\"Marx: A Biography\\". Simon and Schuster. New York, 1968. p372 Repression in Europe and internal divisions between the anarchist and Marxist currents led eventually to its dissolution in 1876. Shortly thereafter, the Marxist and revolutionary socialist tendencies continued the internationalist strategy of the IWA through the successor organisation of the Second International, though without the inclusion of the anarchist and anarcho- syndicalist movements. == Second International == Proletarian internationalism was perhaps best expressed in the resolution sponsored by Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg at the Seventh Congress of the Second International at Stuttgart in 1907 which asserted: > Wars between capitalist states are, as a rule, the outcome of their > competition on the world market, for each state seeks not only to secure its > existing markets, but also to conquer new ones. In this, the subjugation of > foreign peoples and countries plays a prominent role. These wars result > furthermore from the incessant race for armaments by militarism, one of the > chief instruments of bourgeois class rule and of the economic and political > subjugation of the working class. > Wars are favored by the national prejudices which are systematically > cultivated among civilized peoples in the interest of the ruling classes for > the purpose of distracting the proletarian masses from their own class tasks > as well as from their duties of international solidarity. > Wars, therefore, are part of the very nature of capitalism; they will cease > only when the capitalist system is abolished or when the enormous sacrifices > in men and money required by the advance in military technique and the > indignation called forth by armaments, drive the peoples to abolish this > system. The resolution concluded: > If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and > their parliamentary representatives in the countries involved, supported by > the coordinating activity of the International Socialist Bureau, to exert > every effort in order to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they > consider most effective, which naturally vary according to the sharpening of > the class struggle and the sharpening of the general political situation. > In case war should break out anyway, it is their duty to intervene in favor > of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic > and political crisis created by the war to rouse the masses and thereby to > hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule.International Socialist > Congress at Stuttgart, August 18–24, 1907 Vorwärts Publishers, Berlin, 1907, > pp. 64-66. In fact, Luxemburg and Lenin had very different interpretations of the national question. Lenin and the Bolsheviks opposed imperialism and chauvinism by advocating a policy of national self-determination, including the right of oppressed nations to secede from Russia. They believed this would help to create the conditions for unity between the workers in both oppressing and oppressed nations. Specifically, Lenin claimed: \\"The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression and it is this content that we unconditionally support\\".Lenin, The Right of Nations to Self-Determination. By contrast, Luxemburg broke with the mainstream Polish Socialist Party in 1893 on the national question. Luxemburg argued that the nature of Russia had changed since Marx's day as Russia was now fast developing as a major capitalist nation while the Polish bourgeoisie now had its interests linked to Russian capitalism. This had opened the possibility of a class alliance between the Polish and Russian working class. The leading party of the Second International, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, voted overwhelmingly in support of Germany's entry into World War I by approving war credits on 4 August 1914. Many other member parties of the Second International followed suit by supporting national governments and the Second International was dissolved in 1916. Proletarian internationalists characterized the combination of social democracy and nationalism as social chauvinism. == World War I == The hopes of internationalists such as Lenin, Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were dashed by the initial enthusiasm for war. Lenin tried to re-establish socialist unity against the war at the Zimmerwald Conference, but the majority of delegates took a pacifist rather than a revolutionary position. In prison, Luxemburg deepened her analysis with The Junius Pamphlet of 1915. In this document, she specifically rejects the notion of oppressor and oppressed states: \\"Imperialism is not the creation of one or any group of states. It is the product of a particular stage of ripeness in the world development of capital, an innately international condition, an indivisible whole, that is recognisable only in all its relations, and from which no nation can hold aloof at will\\".Rosa Luxemburg, \\"The Junius Pamphlet\\" 1915. Proletarian internationalists now argued that the alliances of World War I had proved that socialism and nationalism were incompatible in the imperialist era, that the concept of national self-determination had become outdated and in particular that nationalism would prove to be an obstacle to proletarian unity. Anarcho-syndicalism was a further working class political current that characterised the war as imperialist on all sides, finding organisational expression in the Industrial Workers of the World. The internationalist perspective influenced the revolutionary wave towards the end of World War I, notably with Russia's withdrawal from the conflict following the October Revolution and the revolt in Germany beginning in the naval ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven that brought the war to an end in November 1918. However, once this revolutionary wave had receded in the early 1920s, proletarian internationalism was no longer mainstream in working class politics. == Third International: Leninism versus left communism == Following World War I, the international socialist movement was irreconcilably split into two hostile factions: on the one side, the social democrats, who broadly supported their national governments during the conflict; and on the other side Leninists and their allies who formed the new communist parties that were organised into the Third International, which was established in March 1919. During the Russian Civil War, Lenin and Leon Trotsky more firmly embraced the concept of national self-determination for tactical reasons. In the Third International, the national question became a major bone of contention between mainstream Leninists and \\"left communists\\". By the time World War II broke out in 1939, only a few prominent communists such as the Italian Marxist Amadeo Bordiga and the Dutch council communist Anton Pannekoek remained opponents of Russia's embrace of national self-determination. Following the collapse of the Mussolini regime in Italy in 1943, Bordigists regrouped and founded the International Communist Party (PCInt). The first edition of the party organ, Prometeo (Prometheus), proclaimed: \\"Workers! Against the slogan of a national war which arms Italian workers against English and German proletarians, oppose the slogan of the communist revolution, which unites the workers of the world against their common enemy — capitalism\\".Prometeo, 1 November 1943. The PCInt took the view that Luxemburg, not Lenin, had been right on the national question. == Socialist internationalism and the postwar era == There was a revival of interest in internationalist theory after World War II, when the extent of communist influence in Eastern Europe dramatically increased as a result of postwar military occupations by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government defined its relationship with Eastern European states it occupied such as Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary as based on the principles of proletarian internationalism. The theory was used to justify installing \\"people's democracies\\" in these states, which were to oversee the transition from fascism to Communism. By the early 1960s, this thinking was considered obsolete as most of the \\"people's democracies\\" had established cohesive postwar communist states. Communist ideologues believed that proletarian internationalism was no longer accurate to describe Soviet relations with the newly emerging Eastern European communist bloc, so a new term was coined, namely socialist internationalism. According to Soviet internationalist theory under Nikita Khrushchev, proletarian internationalism could only be evoked to describe solidarity between international peoples and parties, not governments. Inter-state relationships fell into a parallel category, socialist internationalism. Socialist internationalism was considerably less militant than proletarian internationalism as it was not focused on the spread of revolution, but diplomatic, political and to a lesser extent cultural solidarity between preexisting regimes. Under the principles of socialist internationalism, the Warsaw Pact governments were encouraged to pursue various forms of economic or military cooperation with each other and Moscow. At the Moscow International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in June 1969, seventy-five communist parties from around the world formally defined and endorsed the theory of socialist internationalism. One of the key tenets of socialist internationalism as expressed during the conference was that the \\"defense of socialism is the international duty of communists\\", meaning communist governments should be obliged to assist each other militarily to defend their common interests against external aggression. Khrushchev's successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was an even more outspoken proponent of both proletarian and socialist internationalism. In 1976, Brezhnev declared that proletarian internationalism was neither dead nor obsolete and reaffirmed the Soviet Union's commitment to its core concepts of \\"the solidarity of the working class, of communists of all countries in the struggle for common goals, the solidarity in the struggle of the peoples for national liberation and social progress, [and] voluntary cooperation of the fraternal parties with strict observance of the equality and independence of each\\". Under Brezhnev, the Soviet and Warsaw Pact governments frequently evoked proletarian internationalism to fund leftist trade unions and guerrilla insurgencies around the globe. Foreign military interventions could also be justified as \\"internationalist duty\\" to defend or support other communist states during wartime. With Soviet financial or military backing, a considerable number of new communist governments succeeded in assuming power during the late 1960s and 1970s. The United States and its allies perceived this as an example of Soviet expansionism and this aspect of Brezhnev's foreign policy negatively affected diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the West. Outside of the Warsaw Pact, Cuba embraced its own aggressive theory of proletarian internationalism, which was primarily exercised through support for leftist revolutionary movements. One of the fundamental aspects of Cuban foreign policy between 1962 and 1990 was the \\"rule of internationalism\\", which dictated that Cuba must first and foremost support the cause of international revolution through whatever means are available to her. At the founding of the Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America in 1966, Cuban President Fidel Castro declared that \\"for Cuban revolutionaries, the battleground against imperialism encompasses the entire world...the enemy is one and the same, the same one who attacks our shores and our territory, the same one who attacks everyone else. And so we say and proclaim that the revolutionary movement in every corner of the world can count on Cuban combat fighters\\". By the mid 1980s, it was estimated that up to a quarter of Cuba's national military was deployed overseas, fighting with communist governments or factions in various civil conflicts. The Cuban military saw action against the United States while fighting on behalf of the Marxist New Jewel Movement in Grenada. It was also instrumental in installing a communist government in Angola and fighting several costly campaigns during that nation's civil war. == Proletarian internationalism today == Some political groupings such as the PCInt, the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency (formerly the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party, which includes the PCInt) follow the Luxemburgist and Bordigist interpretations of proletarian internationalism as do some libertarian communists. == Leftist opposition to proletarian internationalism == In contrast, some socialists have pointed out that social realities such as local loyalties and cultural barriers militate against proletarian internationalism. For example, George Orwell believed that \\"in all countries the poor are more national than the rich\\". To this, Marxists might counter that while the rich may have historically had the awareness and education to recognize cross-national interest of class, the poor of those same nations likely have not had this advantage, making them more susceptible to what Marxists would describe as the false ideology of patriotism. Marxists assert that patriotism and nationalism serve precisely to obscure opposing class interests that would otherwise pose a threat to the ruling class order. Marxists would also point out that in times of intense revolutionary struggle (the most evident being the revolutionary periods of 1848, 1917–1923 and 1968) internationalism within the proletariat can overtake petty nationalisms as intense class struggles break out in multiple nations at the same time and the workers of those nations discover that they have more in common with other workers than with their own bourgeoisie. On the question of imperialism and national determination, proponents of Third-Worldism argue that workers in \\"oppressor\\" nations (such as the United States or Israel) must first support national liberation movements in \\"oppressed\\" nations (such as Afghanistan or Palestine) before there can be any basis for proletarian internationalism. For example, Tony Cliff, a leading figure of the British Socialist Workers Party, denied the possibility of solidarity between Palestinians and Israelis in the current Middle East situation, writing that \\"Israel is not a colony suppressed by imperialism, but a settler’s citadel, a launching pad of imperialism. It is a tragedy that some of the very people who had been persecuted and massacred in such bestial fashion should themselves be driven into a chauvinistic, militaristic fervour, and become the blind tool of imperialism in subjugating the Arab masses\\". Trotskyists argue that there must be a permanent revolution in Third World countries in which a bourgeoisie revolution will inevitably lead to a worker's revolution with an international scope. This can be seen in the October Revolution before the movement was stopped by Stalin, a proponent of socialism in one country. Because of this threat, the bourgeoisie in Third World countries will willingly subjugate themselves to national and capitalist interests in order to prevent a proletarian uprising. Internationalists would respond that capitalism has proved itself incapable of resolving the competing claims of different nationalisms and that the working class (of all countries) is oppressed by capitalism, not by other workers. Moreover, the global nature of capitalism and international finance make \\"national liberation\\" an impossibility. For internationalists, all national liberation movements, whatever their \\"progressive\\" gloss, are therefore obstacles to the communist goal of world revolution. == See also == * Alter-globalization * Export of revolution * Global citizens movement * Social patriotism == References  External links == * \\"Internationalism and Nationalism\\" by Liu Shaoqi * \\"Marxism and Nationalism\\" by Tom Lewis * \\"The Importance of Ideas in Party Building\\" by Marry Scully * \\"Without anti-capitalist theory and practice no anti-capitalist victory is possible\\" by Ernest Mandel * \\"In the Belly of the Beast: Challenging US Imperialism and the Politics of the Offensive\\" (PDF) by Dan Jakopovich * \\"The Proletariat and War\\" by the International Communist Current Category:Political terminology Category:Political theories Category:Marxist theory Category:Political science terminology Category:World government Category:Marxist terminology Category:Internationalism ","title":"Proletarian internationalism"},{"id":"46399036","text":"Tamás Molnár (born 5 June 1975) is a powerlifter and world champion.

As a term within Marxist theory, it was first coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels by at least 1850, but since then it has been used to refer to different concepts by different theorists, most notably Leon Trotsky. Trotsky's permanent revolution is an explanation of how socialist revolutions could occur in societies that had not achieved advanced capitalism. Trotsky's theory also argues that the bourgeoisie in late- developing capitalist countries are incapable of developing the productive forces in such a manner as to achieve the sort of advanced capitalism which will fully develop an industrial proletariat; and that the proletariat can and must therefore seize social, economic and political power, leading an alliance with the peasantry. == Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels == Marx first used the term in the phrase \\"by substituting permanent war for permanent revolution\\" in the following passage from The Holy Family (1844) in which he also wrote: > Napoleon presented the last battle of revolutionary terror against the > bourgeois society which had been proclaimed by this same Revolution, and > against its policy. Napoleon, of course, already discerned the essence of > the modern state; he understood that it is based on the unhampered > development of bourgeois society, on the free movement of private interest, > etc. He decided to recognise and protect this basis. He was no terrorist > with his head in the clouds. Yet at the same time he still regarded the > state as an end in itself and civil life only as a treasurer and his > subordinate which must have no will of its own. He perfected the terror by > substituting permanent war for permanent revolution. He fed the egoism of > the French nation to complete satiety but demanded also the sacrifice of > bourgeois business, enjoyments, wealth, etc., whenever this was required by > the political aim of conquest. If he despotically suppressed the liberalism > of bourgeois society—the political idealism of its daily practice—he showed > no more consideration for its essential material interests, trade and > industry, whenever they conflicted with his political interests. His scorn > of industrial hommes d'affaires [businessmen] was the complement to his > scorn of ideologists. In his home policy, too, he combated bourgeois society > as the opponent of the state which in his own person he still held to be an > absolute aim in itself. Thus he declared in the State Council that he would > not suffer the owner of extensive estates to cultivate them or not as he > pleased. Thus, too, he conceived the plan of subordinating trade to the > state by appropriation of roulage [road haulage]. French businessmen took > steps to anticipate the event that first shook Napoleon's power. Paris > exchange-brokers forced him by means of an artificially created famine to > delay the opening of the Russian campaign by nearly two months and thus to > launch it too late in the year. In this passage, Marx says that Napoleon prevented the bourgeois revolution in France from becoming fulfilled; that is, he prevented bourgeois political forces from achieving a total expression of their interests. According to Marx, he did this by suppressing the \\"liberalism of bourgeois society\\" and did it because he saw \\"the state as an end in itself\\", a value which supported his \\"political aim of conquest\\". Thus, he substituted \\"permanent war for permanent revolution\\". However, the final two sentences show that the bourgeoisie did not give up hope, but continued to pursue their interests. For Marx, permanent revolution involves a revolutionary class (in this case, the bourgeoisie) continuing to push for and achieve its interests despite the political dominance of actors with opposing interests. By 1849, Marx and Engels were able to quote the use of the phrase by other writers (Eugen Alexis Schwanbeck, a journalist on the Kölnische Zeitung newspaper; and Henri Druey), suggesting that it had achieved some recognition in intellectual circles.  March 1850 Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League  Marx's most famous use of the phrase permanent revolution is his March 1850 Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League. His audience is the proletariat in Germany, faced with the prospect that \\"the petty-bourgeois democrats will for the moment acquire a predominant influence\\", i.e. temporary political power. He enjoins them as such: > While the democratic petty bourgeois want to bring the revolution to an end > as quickly as possible, achieving at most the aims already mentioned, it is > our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the > more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling > positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the > association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far – not only > in one country but in all the leading countries of the world – that > competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least > the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the > workers. In the remainder of the text, Marx outlines his proposal that the proletariat \\"make the revolution permanent\\". In essence, it consists of the working class maintaining a militant and independent approach to politics both before, during and after the struggle which will bring the petty-bourgeois democrats to power.  Proletariat should organise autonomously  Marx is concerned that throughout the process of this impending political change the petty- bourgeoisie will \\"seek to ensnare the workers in a party organization in which general social-democratic phrases prevail while their particular interests are kept hidden behind, and in which, for the sake of preserving the peace, the specific demands of the proletariat may not be presented. Such a unity would be to their advantage alone and to the complete disadvantage of the proletariat. The proletariat would lose all its hard-won independent position and be reduced once more to a mere appendage of official bourgeois democracy\\". Marx outlines how the proletariat should respond to this threat. First, he says that \\"above all the [Communist] League, must work for the creation of an independent organization of the workers' party, both secret and open, and alongside the official democrats, and the League must aim to make every one of its communes a center and nucleus of workers' associations in which the position and interests of the proletariat can be discussed free from bourgeois influence\\". That is, \\"it is essential above all for them to be independently organized and centralized in clubs\\". Marx does say that \\"an association of momentary expedience\\" is permissible if and only if \\"an enemy has to be fought directly\\", although this is not an excuse for a long term alliance since emergency alliances will arise satisfactorily when needed.  Political programme of demands which threaten the bourgeois consensus  In an article two years earlier, Marx had referred to \\"a programme of permanent revolution, of progressive taxes and death duties, and of organisation of labour\\". This confirms the impression that Marx's theory of permanent revolution is not about revolution per se, but rather more about the attitude that a revolutionary class should adopt in the period of their political subjection, including the programme of political demands they should propose. This aspect is raised in the Address. As well as overtures for organisational alliance with the petty bourgeoisie, Marx is concerned about attempts to \\"bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable\\". Therefore, the workers' party must use their autonomous organisation to push a political programme which threatens the bourgeois status quo along the following lines: > 1\\\\. They can force the democrats to make inroads into as many areas of the > existing social order as possible, so as to disturb its regular functioning > and so that the petty-bourgeois democrats compromise themselves; > furthermore, the workers can force the concentration of as many productive > forces as possible – means of transport, factories, railways, etc. – in the > hands of the state. > > 2\\\\. They must drive the proposals of the democrats to their logical extreme > (the democrats will in any case act in a reformist and not a revolutionary > manner) and transform these proposals into direct attacks on private > property. If, for instance, the petty bourgeoisie propose the purchase of > the railways and factories, the workers must demand that these railways and > factories simply be confiscated by the state without compensation as the > property of reactionaries. [...] The demands of the workers will thus have > to be adjusted according to the measures and concessions of the democrats. In this passage, we can see that Marx believes the proletariat should refuse to moderate its demands to the petty-bourgeois consensus and advocate extensive nationalisation. Furthermore, the demand of the workers should always seek to push the bourgeois further than they are prepared to go, without the revolution threatening them as well.  Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League in context  Marx concludes his Address by summarising the themes elucidated above: > Although the German workers cannot come to power and achieve the realization > of their class interests without passing through a protracted revolutionary > development, this time they can at least be certain that the first act of > the approaching revolutionary drama will coincide with the direct victory of > their own class in France and will thereby be accelerated. But they > themselves must contribute most to their final victory, by informing > themselves of their own class interests, by taking up their independent > political position as soon as possible, by not allowing themselves to be > misled by the hypocritical phrases of the democratic petty bourgeoisie into > doubting for one minute the necessity of an independently organized party of > the proletariat. Their battle-cry must be: The Permanent Revolution. Since Marxism emphasises the contingency of political developments on material historical circumstances (as against idealism), it is worthwhile to have some idea of how Marx saw the context in which he advocated permanent revolution. It seems that he believed that \\"the first act of the approaching revolutionary drama [in Germany] will coincide with the direct victory of their own class in France and will thereby be accelerated\\". That is, the petty-bourgeois are expected to come to power in Germany at the same time as the direct victory of the proletariat in France. Furthermore, Marx seems to believe that the former and hence of both is \\"imminent\\" (c.f. the third paragraph of the Address). Therefore, Marx clearly believes that Europe is entering a time and is at a level of development of the productive forces in which the proletariat have the social revolution within their reach. Although circumstances did not develop as anticipated, this observation proved accurate at the dawn of the 20th century leading into the First World War and the Russian Revolution.  Relation to Trotskyist theory  Marx and Engels advocated permanent revolution as the proletarian strategy of maintaining organisational independence along class lines and a consistently militant series of political demands and tactics. However, at no stage does Marx make the central claim with which Trotsky's conception of permanent revolution is concerned, i.e. that it is possible for a country to pass directly from the dominance of the semi-feudal aristocrats, who held political power in Russia in the early part of the 19th century, to the dominance of the working class, without an interceding period of dominance by the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, Marx's statements in his March 1850 Address explicitly contradict such a view, assuming a \\"period of petty-bourgeois predominance over the classes which have been overthrown and over the proletariat\\". In his History of the Russian Revolution, Trotsky argues that this was shortened to the period between February and October 1917. Marx and Engels do not claim that socialism is impossible in one country, but they do say that \\"in all probability, the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity\\" (Engels' The Principles of Communism, Sections 17 and 19). The Communist Manifesto alludes to Marx's view that the dominance of the bourgeoisie is a necessary prelude to that of the proletariat, arguing that \\"the bourgeoisie therefore produces [...] its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable\\". In this sense, Trotsky's version of the theory represents both a development and to some observers a contradiction of the expressed opinions of Marx and Engels. It must be borne in mind that for Marx the dominance of the bourgeoisie as a prerequisite for subsequent proletarian rule holds on a world scale as The Communist Manifesto makes clear: \\"Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle\\" (loc. cit.). Trotsky's theory took it for granted (as did Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution) that the domination of the world by the bourgeoisie was complete and irreversible after the emergence of imperialism in the late 19th century. The uncertain relationship between international and national parameters in relation to class power underlies many of the disputes concerning the theory of the permanent revolution. In the preface to the 1882 Russian edition of The Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels explicitly raised the issues Trotsky would later develop: \\"Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West? The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development\\". By stating that this is \\"[t]he only answer possible today\\", they incontrovertibly emphasized the priority of the international class situation over national developments. == Leon Trotsky == Leon Trotsky's conception of permanent revolution is based on his understanding—drawing on the work of fellow Russian Alexander Parvus—that a Marxist analysis of events begins with the international level of development, both economic and social. National peculiarities are only an expression of the contradictions in the world system. According to this perspective, the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself in a reactionary period of world capitalism. The situation in the backward and colonial countries, particularly Russia, bore this out. This conception was first developed in the essays later collected in his book 1905 and in his essay Results and Prospects and later developed in his 1929 book The Permanent Revolution. The basic idea of Trotsky's theory is that in Russia the bourgeoisie would not carry out a thorough revolution which would institute political democracy and solve the land question. These measures were assumed to be essential to develop Russia economically. Therefore, it was argued the future revolution must be led by the proletariat, who would not only carry through the tasks of the bourgeois- democratic revolution, but would also commence a struggle to surpass the bourgeois-democratic revolution itself. How far the proletariat would be able to continue would depend upon the further course of events and not upon the designation of the revolution as bourgeois-democratic. In this sense, the revolution would be made permanent. Trotsky believed that a new workers' state would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless socialist revolutions quickly took hold in other countries as well. This theory was advanced in opposition to the position held by the Stalinist faction within the Bolshevik Party that socialism in one country could be built in the Soviet Union. Trotsky's theory was developed in opposition to the social-democratic theory that undeveloped countries must pass through two distinct revolutions. First, the bourgeois-democratic revolution which socialists would assist and at a later stage the socialist revolution with an evolutionary period of capitalist development separating those stages. This is often referred to as the theory of stages, the two-stage theory or stagism. An edition of The Permanent Revolution published by Socialist Resistance Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks initially held to an intermediate theory. Lenin's earlier theory shared Trotsky's premise that the bourgeoisie would not complete a bourgeois revolution. Lenin thought that a democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants could complete the tasks of the bourgeoisie. By 1917, Lenin was arguing not only that the Russian bourgeoisie would not be able to carry through the tasks of the bourgeois- democratic revolution and therefore the proletariat had to take state power, but also that it should take economic power via a soviet. This position was put forward to the Bolsheviks on his return to Russia in his \\"April Theses\\". The first reaction of the majority of Bolsheviks was one of rejection. Initially, only Alexandra Kollontai rallied to Lenin's position within the Bolshevik Party. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks, now including Trotsky, did not discuss the theory of permanent revolution as such. However, its basic theses can be found in such popular outlines of communist theory as The ABC of Communism which sought to explain the program of the Bolshevik Party by Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Nikolai Bukharin. Later on after Lenin's death in the 1920s, the theory did assume importance in the internal debates within the Bolshevik Party and was a bone of contention within the opposition to Joseph Stalin. In essence, a section of the Bolshevik Party leadership, whose views were voiced at the theoretical level by Bukharin, argued that socialism could be built in a single country, even an underdeveloped one like Russia. Bukharin argued that Russia's pre-existing economic base was sufficient for the task at hand, provided the Soviet Union could be militarily defended. The question of the Chinese Revolution and the subjection of the Chinese Communist Party to control by the Kuomintang at the behest of the Bolshevik Party was a topic of argument within the opposition to Stalin in the party. On the one hand, figures such as Karl Radek argued that a stagist strategy was correct for China, although their writings are only known to us now second hand, having perished in the 1930s (if original copies exist in the archives, they have not been located since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991). On the other hand, Trotsky generalised his theory of permanent revolution which had only been applied in the case of Russia previously and argued that the proletariat needed to take power in a process of uninterrupted and permanent revolution in order to not only carry out the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, but to implement socialism. His position was put forward in his essay entitled The Permanent Revolution which can be found today in a single book together with Results and Prospects. Not only did Trotsky generalise his theory of permanent revolution in this essay, but he also grounded it in the idea of uneven and combined development. In contrast to the conceptions inherent within stagist theory, this argument goes to argue that capitalist nations, indeed all class-based societies, develop unevenly and that some parts will develop more swiftly than others. However, it is also argued that this development is combined and that each part of the world economy is increasingly bound together with all other parts. The conception of uneven and combined development also recognises that some areas may even regress further economically and socially as a result of their integration into a world economy. == Theory since Trotsky ==  Trotskyists  Since the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940, the theory of permanent revolution has been maintained by the various Trotskyist groups which have developed since then. However, the theory has been extended only modestly, if at all. While their conclusions differ, works by mainstream Trotskyist theoreticians such as Robert Chester, Joseph Hansen, Michael Löwy and Livio Maitan related it to post-war political developments in Algeria, Cuba and elsewhere.  Tony Cliff's deflected permanent revolution  An attempt to elaborate an exception to the theory was made by Tony Cliff of the Socialist Workers Party. In a 1963 essay, Cliff develops the idea that where the proletariat is unable to take power, a section of the intelligentsia may be able to carry out a bourgeois revolution. He further argues that the use of Marxist concepts by such elements (most notably in Cuba and China, but also for example by regimes espousing Arab socialism or similar philosophies) is not genuine, but is the use of Marxism as an ideology of power. This reflects his view that these countries are state capitalist societies rather than deformed workers states. Cliff's views have been criticised by more orthodox Trotskyists as an abandonment of Trotsky's theory in all but name in favour of the stagist theory, countering that Cliff was more cautious than Trotsky about the potential of the working class in underdeveloped countries to seize power. Cliff saw such revolutions as a detour or deflection on the road to socialist revolution rather than a necessary preliminary to it.  Mahir Çayan's critique of Trotskyist theory  According to Mahir Çayan, the revolutionary perspective of Marx and Engels in the phase from 1848 until Autumn 1850 is the permanent revolution. This strategical vision is the result of the misjudgment of the related phase. Based on the great crises (the global commercial and industrial crises and the agricultural crisis) in 1847, Marx and Engels assumed that the final hours of capitalism has come and the great fight and the age of the socialist revolutions have begun finally. This means Marx and Engels thought that the 1847 boomed global economical crisis of capitalism was the permanent and the last crisis of the system. This theory of permanent revolution is the product of the theory of permanent crisis. In the 1847–1850 phase, Marx and Engels thought that the proletarian revolution in France and in Europe were going to be in the immediate future, therefore they were standing for the leadership of the proletariat to undertake the overdue bourgeois revolution in Germany. In this period, Marx and Engels focused most of their practical and theoretical works on Germany, writing the following in The Communist Manifesto: > The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country > is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out > under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more > developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and > France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in > Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian > revolution.Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (February 1848). The Communist > Manifesto. Çayan argues that the permanent revolution was the revolution considered for Germany by Marx and Engels and this permanent revolution was not a stageless, but a stagewise revolution theory. This is the fundamental property of this theory which was applied to life in the imperialist epoch by Lenin that distinguishes itself from the theory of Trotskyist permanent revolution. Not only Marx and Engels, but also Gottschalk and his supporters have considered the permanent revolution for Germany in 1849. However, the permanent revolution of Gottschalk and his supporters is a stageless or a one-stage revolution. According to Çayan, underestimating of the revolutionary potential of the peasants and refusal to make an alliance with the proletariat are the essences of this theory. Finally, Çayan stated: \\"The essence of Trotsky's Permanent Revolution Theory, that he tried to base on Marx, belongs to the vulgar communists Gottschalk and Weitling, meaning that the Trotskyist Permanent Revolution Theory is NOT a Marxist Theory\\".Çayan, Mahir. \\"Kesintisiz Devrim-I\\".  Saumyendranath Tagore  Saumyendranath Tagore, the founder of the Revolutionary Communist Party of India and an international communist leader, argued that \\"the theory of Permanent Revolution has two aspects, one relating to the revolution of a particular country, the immediate passing over from the bourgeois democratic phase of the revolution to the socialist revolution. The second aspect [...] is related to the international tasks of the revolution [...] which makes it imperative for the first victorious revolution to operate as the yeast of revolution in the world arena. [...] Trotsky became the target of Stalin's vengeance only so far as he drew the attention of the communists throughout the world to the betrayal of world revolution (Permanent Revolution) by Stalin\\". Tagore also argued that the theory of permanent revolution has nothing to do with Trotskyism, but it is pure Marxism and Leninism. As an example, he points out that the term permanent revolution itself was coined by Marx and Engels back in 1850 in their Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League. According to Tagore, Lenin was just as much a champion of the permanent revolution as Trotsky was and with a \\"much more sure grasp of revolutionary reality\\". However, he argues that Trotsky \\"certainly had done a great service to revolutionary communism by drawing out attention over and over again to the theory of permanent revolution since Lenin died in 1924 and the sinister anti- revolutionary reign of Stalin started\\". In the face of what Tagore termed \\"the next diabolical machineries of vilification and terror of Stalinocracy\\", Trotsky kept \\"the banner of revolutionary communism flying in the best traditions of Marx and Lenin. Therein lies Trotsky's invaluable service in the theory of Permanent Revolution. So far as the Theory itself is concerned, it is pure and simple revolutionary Marxism\\". == See also == * New Democracy * Socialism in one country * Communist terrorism == References  External links == * Permanent revolution.

A total of 343 voting delegates from 58 countries were in attendance. The 4th World Congress is best remembered for having amplified the tactic of the United Front into a fundamental part of international Communist policy. The gathering also elected a new set of leaders to the Comintern's governing body, the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). ==History== Historical background The 4th World Congress of the Comintern was convened on November 5, 1922 — just days after Benito Mussolini's March on Rome that effectively seized power for his National Fascist Party.Bertil Hessel, \\"Introduction\\" to Theses, Resolutions, and Manifestos of the First Four Congresses of the Third International. London: Ink LInks, 1980, pp. xxxi-xxxii. The revolutionary upsurge which had swept Europe during the years immediately following the termination of World War I was clearly in full retreat and the international Communist movement saw itself in need for accommodation to this changed political environment. With the prospects for immediate revolution in the industrialized countries of Western Europe fading, the defense of the regime in Soviet Russia had rapidly come to be seen as the chief priority of the Communist movement.Hessel, \\"Introduction,\\" pg. xxxii. Owing to the failure of revolution in Finland, Germany, Hungary, and elsewhere, the stature of the Communist Party of Russia was enhanced relative to other Communist Parties of the world, and tendencies towards centralization and Russian dominance were thereby accelerated. Convocation The 4th World Congress was attended by 343 voting delegates from 58 different countries.Duncan Hallas, The Comintern: A History of the Third International (1985). Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2008; pg. 71. An additional 65 delegates were present with the right to speak but not to vote, and another 6 were admitted as guests.Jane Degras (ed.), The Communist International, 1919-1943: Documents: Volume 1, 1919-1922. London: Oxford University Press, 1956; pg. 374. The gathering was the last congress of the Comintern attended by Soviet leader V.I. Lenin, who was too ill to attend any regular sessions and only appeared to deliver a single speech.Hallas, The Cominern, pg. 70. The Congress opened at 9 pm in the People's House in Petrograd, called to order by Clara Zetkin of Germany, who noted the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution of 1917.John Riddell (ed.), Toward the United Front: Proceedings of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, 1922. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2012; pg. 63. An honorary 13 member Presidium of the Congress — chosen in advance by ECCI in consultation with important national parties — was unanimously elected as the first order of business.Riddell (ed.), Toward the United Front, pg. 64. Factional turmoil The World Congress, as the highest decision-making authority of the Communist International, was marked by the bitter factional battles of various member parties, with each group seeking final decision in favor of its policies and positions. Chief among these was the battle among the delegates of the Communist Party of America, split into two hostile factional groups.Degras, The Communist International, 1919-1943, vol. 1, pg. 375. The battle spilled into the nominations for the American seat on the governing Executive Committee of the Communist International, with American Otto Huiswoud protesting the nomination of C.E.

Johnson Jr. (born November 21, 1985) is an American saxophonist, bandleader, composer, producer, and actor from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. A multi-instrumentalist, he is best known as a tenor and soprano saxophone player but also performs and records on alto and baritone saxophones, clarinet, and flute. Johnson has worked with many of the biggest names in New Orleans music, including Aaron Neville, Harry Connick Jr., the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Mystikal, Irvin Mayfield, Mannie Fresh, and others. Johnson is the nephew of New Orleans clarinetist Ralph Johnson, a longtime member of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. Johnson began playing saxophone at the age of seven, and since 2008 has been playing with his own band, Calvin Johnson & Native Son. In 2015, he started a new band with Dirty Dozen Brass Band founding member and sousaphone player, Kirk Joseph, called Chapter:SOUL. ==Life and career== Johnson was born in New Orleans. He grew up in the Black Pearl neighborhood and in New Orleans East. His uncle Lionel Johnson gave him his first saxophone at the age of seven. Johnson's grandfather, George Augustus \\"Son\\" Johnson, and uncles Lionel, Alfred, and Ralph Johnson, were all New Orleans jazz musicians. At the age of twelve, Johnson played his first professional gig at Tipitina's French Quarter location with the New Orleans Jazz Babyz, a youth all-star band led by Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews and Omari Neville (son of Cyril and Gaynielle Neville). Johnson studied at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation’s School of Music and the Louis Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp under his longtime mentor, Edward \\"Kidd\\" Jordan. He graduated in 2003 from the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), then under the direction of the late Clyde Kerr Jr. His classmates included Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews, Jonathan Batiste, and Christian Scott. After graduating from NOCCA, Johnson enrolled at Dillard University and the University of New Orleans, where he obtained his undergraduate degree in finance. Johnson released his debut album Jewel's Lullaby in 2012 through his own label, Alma Records. In 2013, Johnson released his second album, Native Son, through ThreadHead Records and with support from the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music in the New Orleans Musicians' Village. In addition to his albums recorded as bandleader, Johnson can be heard as a sideman on the following albums: Big Sam’s Funky Nation's Peace, Love, and Understanding, Irvin Mayfield's Strange Fruit, Courtney Bryan's This Little Light of Mine, and others. Johnson has toured with Harry Connick Jr., Aaron Neville, Irvin Mayfield, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Bob French and the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, Big Sam's Funky Nation. Johnson has performed and recorded with hip hop producer Mannie Fresh and rapper Mystikal. He has performed at many esteemed venues and festivals, including Jazz at Lincoln Center, the White House, the Kodak Theatre, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (as both a bandleader and sideman), the French Quarter Festival, Satchmo SummerFest and the Voodoo Music Festival. Johnson’s acting career began with appearances on the HBO series Treme (TV series) in 2012. Johnson's first feature-length film acting role is that of Frank Lewis in director Dan Pritzker's film Bolden!, which depicts the life of New Orleans cornetist Buddy Bolden. In August 2015, Johnson started a new funk band, Chapter:SOUL, with Kirk Joseph of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. In December 2015, Johnson produced a benefit concert for New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity (NOAHH), at Trinity Episcopal Church in the Lower Garden District neighborhood of New Orleans. The concert was titled Calvin Johnson with Strings: Winter Wonder Jam. Johnson serves as a faculty member of the Louis Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp. He also has the pleasure of sitting on the Board of Directors of MaCCNO (Music and Culture Coalition of New Orleans), and in 2015 served as chairmen of NOCCA's (New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) annual spring gala. He is also currently producing a documentary film about New Orleans musical traditions, called TRAD. ==Discography== As Bandleader * Native Son, Threadhead Records, 2013 * Jewel's Lullaby, Alma Records, 2012 Appearances Johnson appears as a sideman on * 2010: This Little Light of Mine - Courtney Bryan * 2008: Peace, Love and Understanding - Big Sam's Funky Nation * 2005: Strange Fruit, Irvin Mayfield & the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (Basin Street Records) ==Filmography and TV appearances== As Actor * Bolden!

As a result, there have been persistent challenges to this aspect of Marx's theoretical achievement and reputation.Shaikh, Anwar [1978] Keynesians argue that a \\"crisis\\" may refer to an especially sharp bust cycle of the regular boom and bust pattern of \\"chaotic\\" capitalist development, which, if no countervailing action is taken, could continue to develop into a recession or depression.Schumpeter, Joseph A., Opie, Redvers (1983) [1934].

Translated from the 1911 original German, Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung. It continues to be argued in terms of historical materialism theory, that such crises will repeat until objective and subjective factors combine to precipitate the transition to the new mode of production either by sudden collapse in a final crisis or gradual erosion of the basing on competition and the emerging dominance of cooperation. ==Causes of crises== Employment, production, consumption, and investment in the USA Karl Marx considered his crisis theory to be his most substantial theoretical achievement.Roman Rosdolsky [1980] 'The Making of Marx's 'Capital p.381Joseph A.

It is from the historical standpoint the most important law.\\"Roman Rosdolsky [1980] 'The Making of Marx's 'Capital p.381.[fn. corrected Marx 1973 Grundrisse p.748]Kliman, Andrew [2015] The Great Recession and Marx's Crisis Theory.

A key characteristic of these theoretical factors is that none of them are natural or accidental in origin but instead arise from systemic elements of capitalism as a mode of production and basic social order. In Marx's words, \\"The real barrier of capitalist production is capital itself\\".\\"Ch. 15 Vol 3 of Capital\\". marxists.org The law of the falling rate of profit, the unexpected consequence of the profit motive, is described by Marx as a \\"two-faced law with the same causes for a decrease in the rate of profits and a simultaneous increase of the mass of profits\\",Karl Marx, Capital III, p258 \\"In short, the same development of the social productivity of labour expresses itself in the course of capitalist development on the one hand in a tendency to a progressive fall of the rate of profit, and on the other hand in a progressive increase of the absolute mass of the appropriated surplus value, or profit; so that on the whole a relative decrease of variable capital and profit is accompanied by an absolute increase of both.\\"Karl Marx, Capital III, p.261Bernice Shoul [1965] p.288 ==Crisis, or cycles? Alternative Marxist theories of crisesRoberts, Michael [2018] Marx 200 - a review of Marx's economics 200 years after his birth p.60 et seq.== In 1929 the Communist Academy in Moscow published \\"The Capitalist Cycle: An Essay on the Marxist Theory of the Cycle\\", a 1927 report by Bolshevik theoretician Pavel Maksakovsky to the seminar on the theory of reproduction at the Institute of Red Professors of the Communist Academy. This work explains the connection between crises and regular business cycles based on the cyclical dynamic disequilibrium of the reproduction schemes in volume 2 of \\"Capital\\". This work rejects the various theories elaborated by \\"Marxian\\" academics. In particular it explains that the collapse in profits following a boom and crisis is not the result of any long term tendency but is rather a cyclical phenomenon. The recovery following a depression is based on replacement of labor-intensive techniques that have become uneconomic at the low prices and profit margins following the crash. This new investment in less labor-intensive technology takes market share from competitors by producing at lower cost while also lowering the average rate of profit and thus explains the actual mechanism for both economic growth with improved technology and a long run tendency for the rate of profit to fall. The recovery eventually leads to another boom because the lag for gestation of fixed capital investment results in prices that continue such investment until eventually the completed projects deliver overproduction and a crash.Maksakovsky, Pavel [2009] The Capitalist Cycle Haymarket There is a long history of interpreting Crisis theory, rather as a theory of cycles than of crisis. An example in 2013 by Peter D. Thomas and Geert Reuten, \\"Crisis and the Rate of Profit in Marx's Laboratory\\" suggests controversially that even Marx's own critical analysis can be claimed to have transitioned from the former toward the latter.Peter D. Thomas and Geert Reuten, \\"Crisis and the Rate of Profit in Marx's Laboratory\\" p311-328 in 'In Marx’s Laboratory. Critical Interpretations of the Grundrisse' Riccardo Bellofiore, Guido Starosta and Peter D. Thomas eds [2013]Brill, ([2014] Haymarket). ==Similarities (and differences) in the work of J. S. Mill & Marx== There are several elements in Marx's presentation which attest to his familiarity with Mill's formulations, notably Mill's treatment of what Marx would subsequently call counteracting tendencies: destruction of capital through commercial revulsions §5, improvements in production §6, importation of cheap necessaries and instruments §7, and emigration of capital §8.John Stuart Mill [1965] Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy, University of Toronto PressShoul, Bernice (1965) 'Similarities in the work of John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx', Science & Society, 29 (3), Summer, pp. 270-295.Joseph A. Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis Allen & Unwin 1954 p.652fn18 \\"In Marx's system, as in Mill's the falling rate of profit is a long-run tendency precisely because of the \\"counteracting influences at work which thwart and annul the effects of this general law, leaving to it merely the character of a tendency.\\"Karl Marx, Capital, III p.272 These counteracting forces are as follows:Karl Marx, Capital, III p.272-82 (1) An increase in the intensity of exploitation (via intensification of labor or the extension of the working day); (2) Depression of wages below their value ... ; (3) Cheapening of the elements of constant capital (via increased productivity); (4) Relative overproduction (which keeps many workers employed in relatively backward industries, such as luxury goods, where the organic composition of capital is low); (5) Foreign trade (which offers cheaper commodities and more profitable channels of investment); and (6) The increase of \\"stock capital\\" (interest bearing capital, whose low rate of return is not averaged with others). Again, like Mill, Marx indicates the post-crisis waste of capital which restores profitability, but this is not mentioned specifically as a counter-tendency until the cyclical nature of the system is demonstrated. On the other hand, Mill does not refer to depression of wages below their value, relative overpopulation, or the increase in \\"stock capital\\". But on the most important counter-tendencies, that is, the effects of increasing productivity at home in cheapening commodities and of foreign trade in providing both cheaper goods and greater profits, Marx and Mill are in accord.\\"Bernice Shoul [1965] 'Similarities in the Work of John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx' p.288-289 ==Application== It is a tenet of many Marxist groupings that crises are inevitable and will be increasingly severe until the contradictions inherent in the mismatch between the relations of production and the development of productive forces reach the final point of failure, determined by the quality of their leadership, the development of the consciousness of the various social classes, and other \\"subjective factors\\". Thus, according to this theory, the degree of \\"tuning\\" necessary for intervention in otherwise \\"perfect\\" market mechanisms will become more and more extreme as the time in which the capitalist order is a progressive factor in the development of productive forces recedes further and further into the past. But the subjective factors are the explanation for why purely objective factors such as the severity of a crisis, the rate of exploitation, etc., do not alone determine the revolutionary upsurge. A common example is the contrast of the oppression of the working classes in France in centuries prior to 1789 which although greater did not lead to social revolution as it did once the complete correlation of forces appeared. Kuruma in his 1929 Introduction to the Study of Crisis ends by noting \\"... my use of the term \\"theory of crisis\\" is not limited to the theory of economic crisis. This term naturally also encompasses the study of the necessity of imperialist world war as the explosion of the contradictions peculiar to modern capitalism. Imperialist world war itself is precisely crisis in its highest form. Thus, the theory of imperialism must be an extension of the theory of crisis.\\"Samezō Kuruma (1929) https://www.marxists.org/archive/kuruma/crisis-intro.htm David Yaffe, in his application of the theory in the conditions of the end of the Post War Boom in the early 1970s, made an influential link to the expanding role of the state's interventions into economic relations as a politically critical element in attempts by capital to counteract the tendency and find new ways to make the working class pay for the crisis. ==Influence== Crisis theory is central to Marx's writings; it helps underpin Marxists' understanding of a need for systemic change. It is controversial; Roman Rosdolsky said \\"The assertion that Marx did not propose a 'breakdown theory' is primarily attributable to the revisionist interpretation of Marx before and after the First World War. Rosa Luxemburg,Rosa Luxemburg [2013] (Peter Hudis ed.) 'The Complete Works of Rosa Luxemburg: Volume I: Economic Writings 1, Verso (p.461–484) Henryk Grossman [and Samezō Kuruma]Rick Kuhn Economic Crisis and Socialist Revolution: Henryk Grossman's Law of accumulation, Its First Critics and His Responses rendered inestimable theoretical services by insisting, as against the revisionists, on the breakdown theory.\\"Rosdolsky 1980.382 fn32 More recently David Yaffe 1972,1978 and Tony Allen et al. 1978,1981 in using the theory to explain the conditions at the end of the post-war boom of the 1970s and 1980s re-introduced the theory to a new generation and gained new readers for Grossman's 1929 presentation of Marx's Crisis theory. Rosa Luxemburg lectured on the 'History of Theories of Economic Crises' at the SPD's Party School in Berlin (possibly in 1911, since the typescript includes a reference to statistics from 1911).Rosa Luxemburg [2013] (Peter Hudis ed.) 'The Complete Works of Rosa Luxemburg: Volume I: Economic Writings 1', Verso (p.461–484) Henryk Grossman's re-presentation of both the central importance of the theory for Marx and the working out of its elements in a partially mathematical form was published in 1929. Central to the argument is the claim that, within a given business cycle, the accumulation of surplus from year to year leads to a kind of top-heaviness, in which a relatively fixed number of workers have to add profit to an ever-larger lump of investment capital. This observation leads to what is known as Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Unless certain countervailing possibilities are available, the growth of capital out-paces the growth of labour, so the profits of economic activity have to be shared out more thinly among capitals, i.e., at a lower profit rate. When countervailing tendencies are unavailable or exhausted, the system requires the destruction of capital values in order to return to profitability. Hence creating the underlying preconditions for post-war boom. Paul Mattick's Economic Crisis and Crisis Theory (published by Merlin Press in 1981) is an accessible introduction and discussion derived from Grossman's work. François Chesnais's (1984, chapter Marx's Crisis Theory Today, in Christopher Freeman ed. Design, Innovation and Long Cycles in Economic Development Frances Pinter, London), discussed the continuing relevance of the theory.

Marx and Keynesians approach and apply the concept of economic crisis in distinct and opposite ways.Mattick, Paul, Marx & Keynes 1974, Merlin The Keynesian approach attempts to stay strictly within the economic sphere and describes 'boom' and 'bust' cycles that balance out. Marx observed and theorised economic crisis as necessarily developing out of the contradictions arising from the dynamics of capitalist production relations.Joseph A. Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis Allen & Unwin 1954 \\"Where Marx differs from Keynes is precisely on the question of the falling rate of profit. It is not the propensity to consume or subjective expectations about future profitability that is crucial for Marx. It is the rate of exploitation and the social productivity of labour that are the key considerations and these in relation to the existing capital stock. While for Keynes the low marginal productivity of capital has its cause in an over- abundance of capital in relation to profit expectations,Keynes, J.M. p136:'It is important to understand the dependence of the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital on changes in expectations because it is chiefly this dependence which renders the marginal efficiency of capital subject to somewhat violent fluctuations which are the explanation of the Trade Cycle' and therefore to a 'potential' over-production of commodities (the capitalist will not invest). For Marx the overproduction of capital is only relative to the social productivity of labour and the existing exploitation conditions. It represents an insufficient mass of surplus-value in relation to total capital. So that for Marx the crisis is, and can only be, resolved by expanding profitable production and accumulation, while for Keynes, it can supposedly be remedied by increasing 'effective demand' and this allows for government induced- production.\\"https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/yaffed/1972/mtccs/mtccs4.htm Yaffe, David [1972] Yaffe noted in 1972 that \\"... passages in Volume III referring to the underconsumption of the masses in no way can be interpreted as an underconsumptionist theory of crisis. The citation usually given in support of an 'underconsumptionist theory of crisis' is Marx's statement that \\"The last cause of all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as compared to the tendency of capitalist production to develop the productive forces in such a way, that only the absolute power of consumption of the entire society would be their limit\\"Capital, Volume III Part V Division of Profit into Interest and Profit of Enterprise. Interest- Bearing Capital § II Ch. XXX Money-Capital and Real Capital p. 484 in the New World paperback edition.Money-Capital and Real Capital ¶ 20 The above passage contains within it no more than a description or a restatement of the capitalist relations of production. Marx called it a tautology to explain the crisis by lack of effective consumption ...Marx, Karl Capital Volume II, p410-1. See also Capital Volume III p239 where the same point is made.Yaffe, David [1972]\\" Other explanations have been formulated, and much debated,Shaikh, Anwar [1978] An introduction to the History of Crisis Theories in U.S. Capitalism in Crisis, URPE, New York including: * The tendency of the rate of profit to fall. The accumulation of capital, the general advancement of techniques and scale of production, and the inexorable trend to oligopoly by the victors of capitalist market competition, all involve a general tendency for the degree of capital intensity, i.e., the \\"organic composition of capital\\" of production to rise. All else constant, this is claimed to lead to a fall in the rate of profit, which would slow down accumulation.Joseph A. Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis Allen & Unwin 1954 * Full employment profit squeeze.Glyn, Andrew & Sutcliffe, Robert British Capitalism, Workers and the Profit Squeeze Penguin 1972 Capital accumulation can pull up the demand for labor power, raising wages. If wages rise \\"too high,\\" it hurts the rate of profit, causing a recession. The interaction between the employment rate and the wage share has been mathematically formalised by the Goodwin model. * Overproduction. If the capitalists win the class struggle to push wages down and labor effort up, raising the rate of surplus value, then a capitalist economy faces regular problems of excess producer supply and thus inadequate aggregate demand and its corollary the underconsumptionist theory. On which Engels comments \\"the underconsumption of the masses, the restriction of the consumption of the masses to what is necessary for their maintenance and reproduction, is not a new phenomenon. It has existed as long as there have been exploiting and exploited classes. The underconsumption of the masses is a necessary condition of all forms of society based on exploitation, consequently also of the capitalist form; but it is the capitalist form of production which first gives rise to crises. The underconsumption of the masses is therefore also a prerequisite condition for crises, and plays in them a role which has long been recognised.

This was first articulated by Karl Marx (1818–1883) as the \\"materialist conception of history\\". It is principally a theory of history which asserts that the material conditions of a society's mode of production or in Marxist terms, the union of a society's productive forces and relations of production, fundamentally determine society's organization and development. Historical materialism is an example of Marx and Engels' scientific socialism, attempting to show that socialism and communism are scientific necessities rather than philosophical ideals. Historical materialism is materialist as it does not believe that history has been driven by individual's consciousness or ideals, but rather subscribes to the philosophical monism that matter is the fundamental substance of nature and henceforth the driving force in all of world history; this drove Marx and other historical materialists to abandon ideas such as rights (e.g. \\"right to life, liberty, and property\\" as liberalism professed).See. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws, 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017). In contrast, idealists believe that human consciousness creates reality rather than the materialist conception that material reality creates human consciousness. This put Marx in direct conflict with groups like the liberals who believed that reality was governed by some set of ideals, when he stated in The German Ideology: \\"Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence\\". Historical materialism looks for the causes of developments and changes in human society in the means by which humans collectively produce the necessities of life. It posits that social classes and the relationship between them, along with the political structures and ways of thinking in society, are founded on and reflect contemporary economic activity. Since Marx's time, the theory has been modified and expanded by some writers. It now has many Marxist and non-Marxist variants. Many Marxists contend that historical materialism is a scientific approach to the study of history. == History and development ==  Origins  Karl Marx never used the words \\"historical materialism\\" to describe his theory of history; the term first appears in Friedrich Engels' 1880 work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, to which Marx wrote an introduction for the French edition. By 1892, Engels indicated that he accepted the broader usage of the term \\"historical materialism,\\" writing the following in an introduction to an English edition of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific; Marx's initial interest in materialism is evident in his doctoral thesis which compared the philosophical atomism of Democritus with the materialist philosophy of Epicurus as well as his close reading of Adam Smith and other writers in classical political economy. A caricature drawn by Engels of Max Stirner, whose 1844 work The Unique and its Property prompted Marx and Engels to theorize a scientific approach to the study of history which they first laid out in The German Ideology (1845) along with a lengthy rebuttal of Stirner's own critique of socialism Marx and Engels first state and detail their materialist conception of history within the pages of The German Ideology, written in 1845. The book, which structural Marxists such as Louis Althusser regard as Marx's first 'mature' work, is a lengthy polemic against Marx and Engels' fellow Young Hegelians and contemporaries Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, and Max Stirner. Stirner's 1844 work The Unique and its Property had a particularly strong impact on the worldview of Marx and Engels: Stirner's blistering critique of morality and whole-hearted embrace of egoism prompted the pair to formulate a conception of socialism along lines of self-interest rather than simple humanism alone, grounding that conception in the scientific study of history. Perhaps Marx's clearest formulation of historical materialism resides in the preface to his 1859 book A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: > The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of > social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men > that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines > their consciousness.  Continued development  In a foreword to his essay Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886), three years after Marx's death, Engels claimed confidently that \\"the Marxist world outlook has found representatives far beyond the boundaries of Germany and Europe and in all the literary languages of the world.\\" Indeed, in the years after Marx and Engels' deaths, \\"historical materialism\\" was identified as a distinct philosophical doctrine and was subsequently elaborated upon and systematized by Orthodox Marxist and Marxist–Leninist thinkers such as Eduard Bernstein, Karl Kautsky, Georgi Plekhanov and Nikolai Bukharin. This occurred despite the fact that many of Marx's earlier works on historical materialism, including The German Ideology, remained unpublished until the 1930s. In the early years of the 20th century, historical materialism was often treated by socialist writers as interchangeable with dialectical materialism, a formulation never used by Marx or Engels. According to many Marxists influenced by Soviet Marxism, historical materialism is a specifically sociological method, while dialectical materialism refers to the more general, abstract philosophy underlying Marx and Engels' body of work. This view is based on Joseph Stalin's pamphlet Dialectical and Historical Materialism, as well as textbooks issued by the Institute of Marxism–Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The substantivist ethnographic approach of economic anthropologist and sociologist Karl Polanyi bears similarities to historical materialism. Polanyi distinguishes between the formal definition of economics as the logic of rational choice between limited resources and a substantive definition of economics as the way humans make their living from their natural and social environment. In The Great Transformation (1944), Polanyi asserts that both the formal and substantive definitions of economics hold true under capitalism, but that the formal definition falls short when analyzing the economic behavior of pre-industrial societies, whose behavior was more often governed by redistribution and reciprocity. While Polanyi was influenced by Marx, he rejected the primacy of economic determinism in shaping the course of history, arguing that rather than being a realm unto itself, an economy is embedded within its contemporary social institutions, such as the state in the case of the market economy. Perhaps the most notable recent exploration of historical materialism is G. A. Cohen's Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence, which inaugurated the school of Analytical Marxism. Cohen advances a sophisticated technological-determinist interpretation of Marx \\"in which history is, fundamentally, the growth of human productive power, and forms of society rise and fall according as they enable or impede that growth.\\"G. A. Cohen, Karl Marx’s Theory of History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), p. x. Jürgen Habermas believes historical materialism \\"needs revision in many respects\\", especially because it has ignored the significance of communicative action. Göran Therborn has argued that the method of historical materialism should be applied to historical materialism as intellectual tradition, and to the history of Marxism itself. In the early 1980s, Paul Hirst and Barry Hindess elaborated a structural Marxist interpretation of historical materialism. Regulation theory, especially in the work of Michel Aglietta draws extensively on historical materialism. Spiral dynamics shows similarities to historical materialism. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's, much of Marxist thought was seen as anachronistic. A major effort to \\"renew\\" historical materialism comes from historian Ellen Meiksins Wood, who wrote in 1995 that, \\"There is something off about the assumption that the collapse of Communism represents a terminal crisis for Marxism. One might think, among other things, that in a period of capitalist triumphalism there is more scope than ever for the pursuit of Marxism’s principal project, the critique of capitalism.\\" > [T]he kernel of historical materialism was an insistence on the historicity > and specificity of capitalism, and a denial that its laws were the universal > laws of history...this focus on the specificity of capitalism, as a moment > with historical origins as well as an end, with a systemic logic specific to > it, encourages a truly historical sense lacking in classical political > economy and conventional ideas of progress, and this had potentially > fruitful implications for the historical study of other modes of production > too. Referencing Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach, Wood says we ought to see historical materialism as “a theoretical foundation for interpreting the world in order to change it.” == Key ideas == Historical materialism builds upon the idea of historical progress that became popular in philosophy during the Enlightenment, which asserted that the development of human society has progressed through a series of stages, from hunting and gathering, through pastoralism and cultivation, to commercial society. Historical materialism rests on a foundation of dialectical materialism, in which matter is considered primary and ideas, thought, and consciousness are secondary, i.e. consciousness and human ideas about the universe result from material conditions rather than vice versa. Historical materialism springs from a fundamental underlying reality of human existence: that in order for subsequent generations of human beings to survive, it is necessary for them to produce and reproduce the material requirements of everyday life. Marx then extended this premise by asserting the importance of the fact that, in order to carry out production and exchange, people have to enter into very definite social relations, or more specifically, \\"relations of production\\". However, production does not get carried out in the abstract, or by entering into arbitrary or random relations chosen at will, but instead are determined by the development of the existing forces of production. How production is accomplished depends on the character of society's productive forces, which refers to the means of production such as the tools, instruments, technology, land, raw materials, and human knowledge and abilities in terms of using these means of production. The relations of production are determined by the level and character of these productive forces present at any given time in history. In all societies, Human beings collectively work on nature but, especially in class societies, do not do the same work. In such societies, there is a division of labour in which people not only carry out different kinds of labour but occupy different social positions on the basis of those differences. The most important such division is that between manual and intellectual labour whereby one class produces a given society's wealth while another is able to monopolize control of the means of production and so both governs that society and lives off of the wealth generated by the labouring classes. Marx identified society's relations of production (arising on the basis of given productive forces) as the economic base of society. He also explained that on the foundation of the economic base there arise certain political institutions, laws, customs, culture, etc., and ideas, ways of thinking, morality, etc. These constitute the political/ideological \\"superstructure\\" of society. This superstructure not only has its origin in the economic base, but its features also ultimately correspond to the character and development of that economic base, i.e. the way people organize society, its relations of production, and its mode of production. G.A. Cohen argues in Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence that a society's superstructure stabilizes or entrenches its economic structure, but that the economic base is primary and the superstructure secondary. That said, it is precisely because the superstructure strongly affects the base that the base selects that superstructure. As Charles Taylor puts it, \\"These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary. The functional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary, for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation.\\"Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, Canadian Journal of Philosophy 10 (1980), p. 330. It is because the influences in the two directions are not symmetrical that it makes sense to speak of primary and secondary factors, even where one is giving a non-reductionist, \\"holistic\\" account of social interaction. To summarize, history develops in accordance with the following observations: Scenes from the tomb of Nakht depicting an agricultural division of labour in Ancient Egypt, painted in the 15th century BC # Social progress is driven by progress in the material, productive forces a society has at its disposal (technology, labour, capital goods and so on) # Humans are inevitably involved in productive relations (roughly speaking, economic relationships or institutions), which constitute our most decisive social relations. These relations progress with the development of the productive forces. They are largely determined by the division of labor, which in turn tends to determine social class. # Relations of production are both determined by the means and forces of production and set the conditions of their development. For example, capitalism tends to increase the rate at which the forces develop and stresses the accumulation of capital. # The relations of production define the mode of production, e.g. the capitalist mode of production is characterized by the polarization of society into capitalists and workers. # The superstructure—the cultural and institutional features of a society, its ideological materials—is ultimately an expression of the mode of production on which the society is founded. # Every type of state is a powerful institution of the ruling class; the state is an instrument which one class uses to secure its rule and enforce its preferred relations of production and its exploitation onto society. # State power is usually only transferred from one class to another by social and political upheaval. # When a given relation of production no longer supports further progress in the productive forces, either further progress is strangled, or 'revolution' must occur. # The actual historical process is not predetermined but depends on class struggle, especially the elevation of class consciousness and organization of the working class. == Key implications in the study and understanding of history == Many writers note that historical materialism represented a revolution in human thought, and a break from previous ways of understanding the underlying basis of change within various human societies. As Marx puts it, \\"a coherence arises in human history\\" because each generation inherits the productive forces developed previously and in turn further develops them before passing them on to the next generation. Further, this coherence increasingly involves more of humanity the more the productive forces develop and expand to bind people together in production and exchange. This understanding counters the notion that human history is simply a series of accidents, either without any underlying cause or caused by supernatural beings or forces exerting their will on society. Historical materialism posits that history is made as a result of struggle between different social classes rooted in the underlying economic base. According to G.A. Cohen, author of Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence, the level of development of society's productive forces (i.e., society's technological powers, including tools, machinery, raw materials, and labour power) determines society's economic structure, in the sense that it selects a structure of economic relations that tends best to facilitate further technological growth. In historical explanation, the overall primacy of the productive forces can be understood in terms of two key theses: In saying that productive forces have a universal tendency to develop, Cohen's reading of Marx is not claiming that productive forces always develop or that they never decline. Their development may be temporarily blocked, but because human beings have a rational interest in developing their capacities to control their interactions with external nature in order to satisfy their wants, the historical tendency is strongly toward further development of these capacities. Broadly, the importance of the study of history lies in the ability of history to explain the present. John Bellamy Foster asserts that historical materialism is important in explaining history from a scientific perspective, by following the scientific method, as opposed to belief-system theories like creationism and intelligent design, which do not base their beliefs on verifiable facts and hypotheses. == Trajectory of historical development == The main modes of production that Marx identified generally include primitive communism, slave society, feudalism, mercantilism, and capitalism. In each of these social stages, people interacted with nature and production in different ways. Any surplus from that production was distributed differently as well. To Marx, ancient societies (e.g. Rome and Greece) were based on a ruling class of citizens and a class of slaves; feudalism was based on nobles and serfs; and capitalism based on the capitalist class (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat).  Primitive communism  To historical materialists, hunter-gatherer societies, also known as primitive communist societies, were structured so that economic forces and political forces were one and the same. Societies generally did not have a state, property, money, nor social classes. Due to their limited means of production (hunting and gathering) each individual was only able to produce enough to sustain themselves, thus without any surplus there is nothing to exploit. A slave at this point would only be an extra mouth to feed. This inherently makes them communist in social relations although primitive in productive forces.  Ancient mode of production  Slave societies, the ancient mode of production, were formed as productive forces advanced, namely due to agriculture and its ensuing abundance which led to the abandonment of nomadic society. Slave societies were marked by their use of slavery and minor private property; production for use was the primary form of production. Slave society is considered by historical materialists to be the first class society formed of citizens and slaves. Surplus from agriculture was distributed to the citizens, which exploited the slaves who worked the fields.  Feudal mode of production  The feudal mode of production emerged from slave society (e.g. in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire), coinciding with the further advance of productive forces. Feudal society's class relations were marked by an entrenched nobility and serfdom. Simple commodity production existed in the form of artisans and merchants. This merchant class would grow in size and eventually form the bourgeoisie. Despite this, production was still largely for use.  Capitalist mode of production  The capitalist mode of production materialized when the rising bourgeois class grew large enough to institute a shift in the productive forces. The bourgeoisie's primary form of production was in the form of commodities, i.e. they produced with the purpose of exchanging their products. As this commodity production grew, the old feudal systems came into conflict with the new capitalist ones; feudalism was then eschewed as capitalism emerged. The bourgeoisie's influence expanded until commodity production became fully generalized: > The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was > monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants > of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild- > masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division > of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of > division of labour in each single workshop. With the rise of the bourgeoisie came the concepts of nation-states and nationalism. Marx argued that capitalism completely separated the economic and political forces. Marx took the state to be a sign of this separation—it existed to manage the massive conflicts of interest which arose between the proletariat and bourgeoisie in capitalist society. Marx observed that nations arose at the time of the appearance of capitalism on the basis of community of economic life, territory, language, certain features of psychology, and traditions of everyday life and culture. In The Communist Manifesto. Marx and Engels explained that the coming into existence of nation-states was the result of class struggle, specifically of the capitalist class's attempts to overthrow the institutions of the former ruling class. Prior to capitalism, nations were not the primary political form. Vladimir Lenin shared a similar view on nation-states. There were two opposite tendencies in the development of nations under capitalism. One of them was expressed in the activation of national life and national movements against the oppressors. The other was expressed in the expansion of links among nations, the breaking down of barriers between them, the establishment of a unified economy and of a world market (globalization); the first is a characteristic of lower-stage capitalism and the second a more advanced form, furthering the unity of the international proletariat. Alongside this development was the forced removal of the serfdom from the countryside to the city, forming a new proletarian class. This caused the countryside to become reliant on large cities. Subsequently, the new capitalist mode of production also began expanding into other societies that had not yet developed a capitalist system (e.g. the scramble for Africa). The Communist Manifesto stated: > National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more > vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of > commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and > in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the > proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the > leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the > emancipation of the proletariat. In proportion as the exploitation of one > individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one > nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the > antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one > nation to another will come to an end. Under capitalism, the bourgeoisie and proletariat become the two primary classes. Class struggle between these two classes was now prevalent. With the emergence of capitalism, productive forces were now able to flourish, causing the industrial revolution in Europe. Despite this, however, the productive forces eventually reach a point where they can no longer expand, causing the same collapse that occurred at the end of feudalism: > Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and > of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of > production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to > control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. > [...] The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to > further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the > contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they > are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring > disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of > bourgeois property.  Communist mode of production   Lower-stage of communism  The bourgeoisie, as Marx stated in The Communist Manifesto, has \\"forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians.\\" Historical materialists henceforth believe that the modern proletariat are the new revolutionary class in relation to the bourgeoisie, in the same way that the bourgeoisie was the revolutionary class in relation to the nobility under feudalism. The proletariat, then, must seize power as the new revolutionary class in a dictatorship of the proletariat. > Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the > revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to > this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing > but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Marx also describes a communist society developed alongside the proletarian dictatorship: > Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of > production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little > does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these > products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to > capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion > but directly as a component part of total labor. The phrase \\"proceeds of > labor\\", objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all > meaning. What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it > has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it > emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, > economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks > of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual > producer receives back from society—after the deductions have been > made—exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual > quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of > the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual > producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share > in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such- > and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common > funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means > of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of > labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in > another. This lower-stage of communist society is, according to Marx, analogous to the lower-stage of capitalist society, i.e. the transition from feudalism to capitalism, in that both societies are \\"stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.\\" The emphasis on the idea that modes of production do not exist in isolation but rather are materialized from the previous existence is a core idea in historical materialism. There is considerable debate among communists regarding the nature of this society. Some such as Joseph Stalin, Fidel Castro, and other Marxist-Leninists believe that the lower-stage of communism constitutes its own mode of production, which they call socialist rather than communist. Marxist-Leninists believe that this society may still maintain the concepts of property, money, and commodity production. Other communists argue that the lower-stage of communism is just that; a communist mode of production, without commodities or money, stamped with the birthmarks of capitalism.  Higher-stage of communism  To Marx, the higher-stage of communist society is a free association of producers which has successfully negated all remnants of capitalism, notably the concepts of states, nationality, sexism, families, alienation, social classes, money, property, commodities, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, division of labor, cities and countryside, class struggle, religion, ideology, and markets. It is the negation of capitalism. Marx made the following comments on the higher-phase of communist society: > In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of > the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis > between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not > only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have > also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all > the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the > narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society > inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each > according to his needs! == Warnings against misuse == In the 1872 Preface to the French edition of Das Kapital Vol. 1, Marx emphasized that \\"[t]here is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.\\" Reaching a scientific understanding required conscientious, painstaking research, instead of philosophical speculation and unwarranted, sweeping generalizations. Having abandoned abstract philosophical speculation in his youth, Marx himself showed great reluctance during the rest of his life about offering any generalities or universal truths about human existence or human history. Marx himself took care to indicate that he was only proposing a guideline to historical research (Leitfaden or Auffassung), and was not providing any substantive \\"theory of history\\" or \\"grand philosophy of history\\", let alone a \\"master-key to history\\". Engels expressed irritation with dilettante academics who sought to knock up their skimpy historical knowledge as quickly as possible into some grand theoretical system that would explain \\"everything\\" about history. He opined that historical materialism and the theory of modes of production was being used as an excuse for not studying history.Engels, cited approvingly by E. P. Thompson in 'The peculiarities of the English,' Socialist Register, 1965. The first explicit and systematic summary of the materialist interpretation of history published was Engels's book Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science, written with Marx's approval and guidance, and often referred to as the Anti-Dühring. One of the polemics was to ridicule the easy \\"world schematism\\" of philosophers, who invented the latest wisdom from behind their writing desks. Towards the end of his life, in 1877, Marx wrote a letter to the editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapisky, which significantly contained the following disclaimer: Marx goes on to illustrate how the same factors can in different historical contexts produce very different results, so that quick and easy generalizations are not really possible. To indicate how seriously Marx took research, when he died, his estate contained several cubic metres of Russian statistical publications (it was, as the old Marx observed, in Russia that his ideas gained most influence). Insofar as Marx and Engels regarded historical processes as law- governed processes, the possible future directions of historical development were to a great extent limited and conditioned by what happened before. Retrospectively, historical processes could be understood to have happened by necessity in certain ways and not others, and to some extent at least, the most likely variants of the future could be specified on the basis of careful study of the known facts. Towards the end of his life, Engels commented several times about the abuse of historical materialism. In a letter to Conrad Schmidt dated 5 August 1890, he stated: Finally, in a letter to Franz Mehring dated 14 July 1893, Engels stated: == Criticism == Philosopher of science Karl Popper, in The Poverty of Historicism and Conjectures and Refutations, critiqued such claims of the explanatory power or valid application of historical materialism by arguing that it could explain or explain away any fact brought before it, making it unfalsifiable and thus pseudoscientific. Similar arguments were brought by Leszek Kołakowski in Main Currents of Marxism. In his 1940 essay Theses on the Philosophy of History, scholar Walter Benjamin compares historical materialism to the Turk, an 18th-century device which was promoted as a mechanized automaton which could defeat skilled chess players but actually concealed a human who controlled the machine. Benjamin suggested that, despite Marx's claims to scientific objectivity, historical materialism was actually quasi-religious. Like the Turk, wrote Benjamin, \\"[t]he puppet called 'historical materialism' is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.\\" Benjamin's friend and colleague Gershom Scholem would argue that Benjamin's critique of historical materialism was so definitive that, as Mark Lilla would write, \\"nothing remains of historical materialism [...] but the term itself\\". Neven Sesardic argues that historical materialism is a highly exaggerated claim. Sesardic observes that it was clear to many Marxists that the social, cultural and ideological superstructure of society was not under the control of the base but had at least some degree of autonomy. It was also clear that phenomena of the superstructure could determine part of the economic base. Thus Sesardic argues that Marxists moved from a claim of the dominance of the economic base to a scenario in which the base sometimes determines the superstructure and the superstructure sometimes determines the base, which Sesardic argues destroys their whole position. This is because this new claim, according to Sesardic, is so innocuous that no-one would deny it, whereas the old claim was very radical, as it posited the dominance of economics. Sesardic argues that Marxists should have abandoned historical materialism when its strong version became untenable, but instead they chose to water it down until it became a trivial claim.Sesardić, Neven. \\"Marxian Utopia.\\" (1985), Centre for Research into Communist Economies, , pp.14-15 == See also == * Analytical Marxism * Classical Marxism * Economic determinism * Formalist–substantivist debate * Fundamentals of Marxism–Leninism * Orthodox Marxism * Parametric determinism * Technological determinism * Theory of historical trajectory == References ==  Citations   Sources  : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : == Further reading == : Critical account which focusses on incoherencies in the thought of Marx, Engels and Lenin. : : American criticism of orthodox Marxism and argument for a more radical version of historical materialism that sticks closer to Marx by changing itself to keep up with changes in the historical situation. : : : Contains an early defence of the materialist conception of history against its critics of the day. : Free interpretation of Marx's idea. : Influential analytical Marxist interpretation. : Captures the full subtlety of Marx's thought, but at length in four volumes. : Good reply to false interpretations of Marx's view of history. : : : Sympathetically critical of dialectical materialism. : Argues historical materialism must be revised to include communicative action. : Marxist view of history according to a leader of the International Socialist Tendency. : : Provides an introductory chapter on historical materialism. : Attempts to provide an alternative to schematic interpretations of historical materialism. : Good survey. : Emphasizes understanding the roots of class society and the state. : Modelled on Lenin's \\"Three components of Marxism\\" but with a section on the reception and diffusion of Marxism in the world. : Standard Maoist reading of Marx's materialism. : : : : : : : : : : : Classic statement by a contemporary and friend of Marx & Engels. : Trotskyist interpretations of problems of history. : Attempts to develop a post-Stalinist interpretation of Marx's project. : Classical Marxist account of the philosophy of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Lukacs, and Trotsky. : : Provides a short survey. : : Classic statement of Stalinist doctrine. : Includes a good short introduction. : : Critical survey of the relationship between sociology and historical materialism. : Polemic which ridicules theorists of history who do not actually study history. : Alternative survey. : Sees historical materialism as a methodology and Das Kapital as an application of the method. : Delves into misinterpretations of Marx including the substitution of \\"Historical materialism\\" by Lenin.

The long-term goal of world communism is a worldwide communist society that is stateless (lacking any state), which may be achieved through an intermediate-term goal of either a voluntary association of sovereign states (a global alliance) or a world government (a single worldwide state). A series of internationals have worked toward world communism and they have included the First International, the Second International, the Third International (the Communist International or Comintern), the Fourth International, the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, the World Socialist Movement and variant offshoots. These are a quite heterogeneous group despite their common ultimate goal of a stateless and global communist society. During the Stalinist era, the idea of socialism in one country, which many international communists considered unworkable, became part of the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as Joseph Stalin and his supporters concluded that it was naive to think that world revolution was imminent. This caused great disillusionment among many communists worldwide, who agreed with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin that international scope was vital to communist success. Other currents of national communism, especially after World War II, tempered the prewar popularity of international communism. The end of the Cold War, with the Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is often called the fall of communism. Nevertheless, some international communists remain among some factions of Maoists, left communists, some present-day Russian communists and others. == Early era (1917–1944) == Marxist philosophy held that because capitalism had become global (and thus capitalists could be expected to cooperate internationally to maintain dominance in class conflict), the proletariat would need to cooperate internationally as well via proletarian internationalism to avoid continued subjugation via divide and rule (thus the rallying cry of \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\"). In this view, after a period of international socialism the terminal stage of development of the (future) history of communism would be world communism. Such theory may treat world communism as a peaceful and prosperous end result, something almost anyone could endorse, but it is the transition to world communism that is contentious. World communism is to be achieved by world revolution, according to a theory that was popular in the period 1917 to around 1933 (at least). World communism is incompatible with the existence of nation states because most communists believe that nations should unite, whether in supranational unions of sovereign states or world government, until such time as either abolition of the state or withering away of the state would occur because governance would no longer require state institutions. In other words, the people of a communist society would be self-governing via direct democracy so direct that the state would not even exist. Flag of the Chinese Soviet Republic which depicts a hammer and sickle spanning the globe as proletarian internationalists believed that one focus of a communist revolution was to ensure another successful revolution elsewhere Abolition of the state is not in itself a distinctively Marxist doctrine. It was sometime it was happened by any of the country held by various socialist and anarchist thinkers of the nineteenth century as well as some present-day anarchists (libertarians are anti-statist typically in a subtly different sense, in that they support small government although not absence of government or state). The crux here is a text of the Friedrich Engels, from his Anti-Dühring. It is often cited as \\"The state is not 'abolished,' it withers away\\". This is from the pioneer work of historical materialism, a formulation of Marx's idea of a materialist conception of history. The withering away of the state is a graphic formulation, that has passed into cliché. The translation (Engels was writing in German) is also given as: \\"The state is not 'abolished'. It dies out\\". , taken from the Emile Burns translation of the 1894 German third edition, Part III section 2. The passage was not in the first edition of 1878. Reference to the whole passage shows that this happens only after the proletariat has seized the means of production. The schematic is therefore revolution, transitional period, ultimate period. Although the ultimate period sounds like a utopia, Marx and Engels did not consider themselves utopian socialists, but rather scientific socialists. They considered violence necessary for resistance of wage slavery. Whereas for Engels the transitional period was reduced to a single act, for Lenin thirty to forty years later it had become extended and \\"obviously lengthy\\".\\"The State and Revolution — Chapter 5\\" . In the same place, he argues strongly that Marx's conception of communist society is not utopian, but takes into account the heritage of what came before. This gives at least roughly the position on world communism as the Comintern was set up in 1919: world revolution is necessary for the setting up of world communism, but not as an immediate or clearly sufficient event. == Stalinist and Cold War era (1947–1991) == During the Stalinist era, the idea of socialism in one country, which many internationalists considered unworkable, became part of the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as Stalin and his supporters concluded that the transitional period would indeed be very long and complicated. Advocates of socialism in one country had not abandoned the goal of ultimate world communism, but they considered it naive to think world revolution was imminent. Thus the Soviet Union dissolved the Third International during World War II. However, Stalin did not intend to implement isolationism despite this one-country approach. Despite retaining the earlier Bolshevik terminology equating imperialism with capitalism and thus decrying empire, the Soviet Union instead pursued a de facto empire of satellite states, similar in ways to the czarist Russian Empire although Soviet ideology could not admit that, to counter the influence of capitalist countries . It also supported revolutionary socialism around the world to continue to work toward world communism, however distant it might be. Thus it backed the 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, the North Vietnamese in the Vietnam War and the MPLA in the Angolan Civil War. The domino theory of the Cold War was driven by this intent as anti-communists feared that isolationism by capitalist countries would lead to the collapse of their self- defense. == Post-Cold War era (1992–present) == The reform and opening of China and the restructuring and openness of the Soviet Union, although they were quite different, both marked a change of direction away from the proselytizing nature of international communism as Lenin and Leon Trotsky had known it. The end of the Cold War, with the revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is often called the fall of communism and a broad consensus since then is that any advent of international communism is not likely in the near future. Nevertheless, some international communists remain among some factions of Maoists, left communists, some present-day Russian communists and others. == References == Category:Communism Category:Communist theory Category:Marxist theory Category:World government ","title":"World communism"},{"id":"46399177","text":"A proletarian revolution is a social revolution in which the working class attempts to overthrow the bourgeoisie. Proletarian revolutions are generally advocated by socialists, communists and most anarchists. Marxists believe proletarian revolutions can and will likely happen in all capitalist countries, related to the concept of world revolution. The Leninist branch of Marxism argues that a proletarian revolution must be led by a vanguard of \\"professional revolutionaries\\", men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who form the nucleus of the communist revolutionary movement. This vanguard is meant to provide leadership and organization to the working class before and during the revolution, which aims to prevent the government from successfully ending it.Vladimir Lenin (1918). The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky. Other Marxists such as Luxemburgists disagree with the Leninist idea of a vanguard and insist that the entire working class—or at least a large part of it—must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build mass working class movements with a very large membership. Finally, there are socialist anarchists and libertarian socialists. Their view is that the revolution must be a bottom-up social revolution which seeks to transform all aspects of society and the individuals which make up the society (see Asturian Revolution and Revolutionary Catalonia). Alexander Berkman said \\"there are revolutions and revolutions. Some revolutions change only the governmental form by putting a new set of rulers in place of the old. These are political revolutions, and as such they often meet with little resistance. But a revolution that aims to abolish the entire system of wage slavery must also do away with the power of one class to oppress another. That is, it is not any more a mere change of rulers, of government, not a political revolution, but one that seeks to alter the whole character of society. That would be a social revolution\\".Alexander Berkman (1929). Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism.

Distinctions of wealth, income, education, culture, or social network might arise and would only be determined by individual experience and achievement in such a society. For the opposite see class society. Thus the concept posits not the absence of a social hierarchy but the uninheritability of class status. Helen Codere defines social class as a segment of the community, the members of which show a common social position in a hierarchical ranking.Codere, H. (1957). Kwakiutl Society: Rank without Class. American Anthropologist, 59(3), 473–486. Codere suggest that a true class- organized society is one in which the hierarchy of prestige and status is divisible into groups each with its own social, economic, attitudinal and cultural characteristics and each having differential degrees of power in community decision. Since determination of life outcome by birth class has proved historically difficult to avoid, advocates of a classless society such as anarchists, communists and libertarian socialists propose various means to achieve and maintain it and attach varying degrees of importance to it as an end in their overall programs/philosophy. == Classlessness == The term classlessness has been used to describe different social phenomena. In societies where classes have been abolished, it is usually the result of a voluntary decision by the membership to form such a society to abolish a pre- existing class structure in an existing society or to form a new one without any. This would include communes of the modern period such as various American utopian communities or the kibbutzim as well as revolutionary and political acts at the nation-state level such as the Paris Commune or the Russian Revolution. The abolition of social classes and the establishment of a classless society is the primary goal of anarchism, communism and libertarian socialism. Classlessness also refers to the state of mind required in order to operate effectively as a social anthropologist. Anthropological training includes making assessments of and therefore becoming aware of one's own class assumptions so that these can be set aside from conclusions reached about other societies. This may be compared to ethnocentric biases or the \\"neutral axiology\\" required by Max Weber. Otherwise conclusions reached about studied societies will likely be coloured by the anthropologist's own class values. Classlessness can also refer to a society that has acquired pervasive and substantial social justice where the economic upper class wields no special political power and poverty as experienced historically is virtually nonexistent as it cannot be achieved. According to Ulrich Beck, classlessness is achieved with class struggle: \\"It is the collective success with class struggle which institutionalizes individualization and dissolves the culture of classes, even under conditions of radicalizing inequalities\\".Beck, U. (2007). Beyond class and nation: Reframing social inequalities in a globalizing world. The British Journal of Sociology, 58(4), 679-705. Essentially, classlessness will exist when the inequalities and injustice out ranks societies idea of the need for social ranking and hierarchy.  Social classes in present day  The state of social classes in society today is disputed. If the actual development is taken by the discussion, then Western society has moved past classes to a classless society. This is reinforced by the statement from Becker and Andreas Hadjar: \\"The weakening of class identities is also postulated by Savage (2000, p. 37), who assumes that although individuals may still refer to social class, class position no longer generates a deep sense of identity and belonging\\".Becker, R. and Hadjar, A. (2013), “Individualisation” and class structure: how individual lives are still affected by social inequalities. International Social Science Journal, 64: 211–223. Some say that society today has not completely abolished classes, but that distinctions can be only attributed to experience and success (meritocracy). Others maintain that the class system remains in place, e.g. by showing that children's success in education correlates with their parent's wealth, and wealth being inherited.Of course class still matters – it influences everything that we do, Will Hutton, The Guardian, January 10, 2010 == Marxist definition == In Marxist theory, tribal hunter-gatherer society, primitive communism, was classless. Everyone was equal in a basic sense as a member of the tribe and the different functional assignments of the primitive mode of production, howsoever rigid and stratified they might be, did not and could not simply because of the numbers produce a classsociety as such. With the transition to agriculture, the possibility to make a surplus product, i.e. to produce more than what is necessary to satisfy one's immediate needs, developed in the course of development of the productive forces. According to Marxism, this also made it possible for a class society to develop because the surplus product could be used to nourish a ruling class which did not participate in production.the surplus value should distribute between people for the welfare == Libertarian socialism == Libertarian socialism, also called left-libertarianism, social anarchism, social libertarianism and socialist libertarianism, is a group of anti-authoritarian socialist political philosophies that rejects socialism as the centralised state ownership and control of the economy, which they regard as state capitalism. Political philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about the government, state, justice, politics, liberty and the enforcement of a legal code by an authoritative body. According to Charles Larmore, the second approach sees political philosophy as the freedom to discipline one-self from the basic features of the human condition that make up the reality of political life.Larmore, C. (2013). What is political philosophy? Journal of Moral Philosophy, 10 (3), 276-306. Libertarianism is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle. Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgment. Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power, but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions.Long, Joseph.W (1996). \\"Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class.\\" Social Philosophy and Policy. 15:2 p. 310. \\"When I speak of 'libertarianism'... I mean all three of these very different movements. It might be protested that LibCap [\\"libertarian capitalism\\"], LibSoc [\\"libertarian socialism\\"] and LibPop [\\"libertarian populism] are too different from one another to be treated as aspects of a single point of view. But they do share a common—or at least an overlapping—intellectual ancestry.\\" Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism (especially anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, collectivist anarchism and mutualism)A Mutualist FAQ: A.4.

It was initially published in Russian, French, German, and English editions. The Executive Committee of the Communist International, commonly known by its acronym, ECCI (Russian acronym ИККИ), was the governing authority of the Comintern between the World Congresses of that body. The ECCI was established by the Founding Congress of the Comintern in 1919 and was dissolved with the rest of the Comintern in May 1943. ==Organizational history== Establishment ECCI building on Vozdvizhenka Street The Communist International was established at a gathering convened in Moscow at the behest of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). As early as December 24, 1918, a radio appeal had been issued by the ruling party of Soviet Russia calling on \\"communists of all countries\\" to boycott any attempts of reformists to reestablish the Second International, but to instead \\"rally around the revolutionary Third International.\\"John Riddell, \\"Introduction\\" to Founding the Communist International: Proceedings and Documents of the First Congress, March 1919. New York: Anchor Foundation/Pathfinder Press, 1987; pg. 8. The formal call for a conference of revolutionary socialist political parties and radical trade unions espousing revolutionary industrial unionism had been issued on January 24, 1919, with the gathering originally slated to commence in Moscow beginning on February 15.Riddell, \\"Introduction\\" to Founding the Communist International, pg. 10. The conference which ultimately declared itself the Founding Congress of the Communist International was postponed to March 2, 1919, owing to the difficulties entailed by foreign delegates in crossing the blockade of Soviet Russia established by the Allied Nations at the end of World War I.Jane Degras (ed.), The Communist International, 1919-1943: Documents. In Three Volumes. London: Oxford University Press, 1956; vol. 1, pg. 5. Only a comparatively few delegates did manage to make the trip, with a number of the places filled on an ad hoc basis by individuals already in Soviet Russia not bearing formal credentials from their home organizations. For example, Boris Reinstein, a druggist from Buffalo, New York who sat ostensibly the delegate of the Socialist Labor Party of America, had been away from home for two years and had no formal authorization to represent his party.James W. Hulse, The Forming of the Communist International. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1964; pg. 18. Similarly, Andreas Rudniansky, a former prisoner of war stranded in Russia represented Hungary, while Christian Rakovsky, a Romanian, sat for the nearly defunct Balkan Socialist Federation.Hulse, Founding the Communist International, pg. 18. A commission (standing committee) chaired by the Swiss radical Fritz Platten was appointed by this Founding Congress to construct an organizational apparatus for the new Third International. This commission recommended the establishment of two deliberative bodies, an Executive Committee, to handle matters of policy, and a 5-member Bureau, to handle day-to-day activities. The governing Executive Committee was to be headquartered in Moscow and to include representatives from the member organizations of the Communist International. The parties of Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Balkan Federation, Switzerland, and Scandinavia were each to \\"immediately send representatives to the first Executive Committee.\\" All parties joining the Comintern before the convention of the 2nd World Congress were similarly to be allowed a representative on this body. Until the arrival of the various elected delegates, representatives of the Russian Communist Party were to perform the functions of this Executive Committee of the Communist International. This organizational plan was approved unanimously by the Congress, without debate.Franz Platten, \\"Resolution on Organizing the International,\\" in Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pp. 255-256. Selected as President of ECCI was Grigorii Zinoviev, an old associate of V.I. Lenin and top figure in the Russian Communist Party. Karl Radek, then ensconced in a Berlin prison, was symbolically selected as Secretary of ECCI, although the actual functions fell to Angelica Balabanov, albeit only for a few weeks.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia. In Fourteen Volumes. London: Macmillan, 1953-78; vol. 3, pg. 124. Zinoviev also served as editor of the official magazine of ECCI, Kommunisticheskii Internatsional (\\"The Communist International\\"), which began appearing regularly as soon as the Founding Congress came to a close.Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pp. 131-132. Although no more than the nucleus of an actual organization was created, hampered by difficult communications in the isolation of the blockade, the skeleton ECCI immediately began to issues a series of declarations and manifestos to the workers and nations of the world. These included a manifesto of ECCI to the workers and sailors of all countries on the Hungarian Revolution (March 28, 1919),Text in Degras (ed.), The Communist International, vol. 1, pp. 48-50. a message to the Bavarian Soviet Republic (April 1919),Text in Degras (ed.), The Communist International, vol. 1, pg. 50. a May Day manifesto (April 20, 1919),Extract in Degras (ed.), The Communist International, vol. 1, pp. 51-53. a manifesto on the Versailles Peace (May 13, 1919),Text in Degras (ed.), The Communist International, vol. 1, pp. 54-58. and a manifesto on foreign intervention in Soviet Russia (June 18, 1919).Extract in Degras (ed.), The Communist International, vol. 1, pp. 48-50. The early ECCI was, in short, to a large extent a propaganda body, aiming to stir the working class to socialist revolution. In the estimation of historian E.H. Carr, the summer and fall of 1920 marked the high-water mark for the prestige of the Comintern and its hopes of promoting world revolution.Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, vol. 3, pg. 165. There would be, however, other functions for the organization and the Executive Committee which directed it. From provisional to permanent status Delegates to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern received a copy of Lenin's new book The Infantile Sickness of \\"Leftism\\" in Communism, published by ECCI. Owing to poor communications and the difficulty of individuals crossing the frontier during the blockade and civil war, of those originally invited to participate only the Communist Party of Hungary was able to send its permanent representative to ECCI prior to the convocation of the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern on July 19, 1920.Degras, The Communist International, vol. 1, pg. 453. This did not mean that ECCI, the Comintern's directing body, was staffed exclusively with Russians during the 1919-1920 period, however. In addition to representatives of the Russian Communist Party Angelica Balabanova, Jan Antonovich Berzin, Nikolai Bukharin, V.V. Vorovsky, Grigorii Zinoviev, and G. Klinger, a number of radicals from around the world had at various times taken part in ECCI's activities. Among this group were László Rudas of Hungary, Jacques Sadoul of France, John Reed of the Communist Labor Party of America, John Anderson (Kristap Beika) of the Communist Party of America, S.J. Rutgers of the Netherlands, in addition to others from Korea, China, Norway, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Finland. During this interval the Comintern, through ECCI and the permanent staff of the organization, began to fund the various communist parties of the world, attempting to add practical support to the literary fusillade which emanated from Moscow. Over time this financial aid provided by the Comintern would help to bind the various national parties to the central body. Still, it would be facile to reduce loyalty to the Comintern and its governing body, ECCI, to mere finances. The array of national communist parties saw themselves in a very real sense as national subdivisions of a single world party and they accepted centralization as a matter of principle and direction in revolutionary strategy and tactics from Moscow, the home of the only successful proletarian revolution as logical and natural. Although Jane Degras in an appendix to her 1956 three volume compendium of Comintern documents intimates that the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern directly elected the membership of ECCI,\\"The Executive Committee elected at the second congress consisted of...\\" See: Degras, The Communist International, vol. 1, pg. 453. the stenographic proceedings of the congress published in 1991 indicates that this was not actually the case. At the close of the final regular session of the congress, held on August 6, 1920, a list of ECCI participants was hurriedly discussed and adopted by a vote of the delegates. Russia, by virtue of the size and importance of its party, was allocated five delegates on the Executive Committee, to be joined by one delegate each from the following nations: Great Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, the Far East (Korea), and the Middle East (Iran).John Riddell (ed.), Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920. In Two Volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 2, pg. 777. No specific individuals were voted upon by the assembled delegates. This decision seems to have been rapidly modified by ECCI itself after conclusion of the congress, as Degras lists by name a 26-member body that was in place over the course of the next year. Included, in addition to the five Russian delegates, were two Americans (one each from the rival Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party of America), two delegates from the Netherlands, as well as one delegate each from Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Scandinavia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the \\"Far East\\" (Korea), the \\"Near East\\" (Iran), Finland, Poland, Hungary, Georgia, Java (Indonesia), plus one representative of the Young Communist International.The timing and mechanism of this expansion is unclear. The full list of those elected appears in Degras, The Communist International, vol. 1, pg. 453. In the aftermath of the 2nd Word Congress, a five-member \\"little bureau\\" was also chosen to coordinate the day-to-day activities of the Comintern. This group included the Russians Zinoviev, Bukharin, and Mikhail Kobetsky, the Hungarian Rudniansky, and the German Ernst Meyer. The composition of this \\"little bureau\\" was presumably named by ECCI itself. This bureau was enlarged in 1921 by the 3rd World Congress of the Comintern by the addition to these five of the Hungarian Béla Kun, Alfred Rosmer of France, Bernard Koenen of Germany, and the Polish-born Soviet citizen Karl Radek.Degras, The Communist International, vol. 1, pp. 453-454. The Comintern also maintained an extensive staff of professional functionaries. The 3rd World Congress of the Comintern, held in Moscow from June 22 through July 12, 1921, did not directly elect an Executive Committee of the Comintern, as did its predecessor. Instead, it decided that the four parties which had been allocated 40 votes at the congress should send two delegates to ECCI, and the 14 parties with 20 to 30 votes should send one delegate. By virtue of its size and status, the Russian Communist Party was allocated five delegates to ECCI, while all other parties were to be entitled to a consultative voice on the committee, but no decisive vote.Degras, The Communist International, vol. 1, pg. 454. ECCI was subsequently enlarged in 1921-22, as new Communist Parties were allotted delegates with consultative votes while other parties were allowed a second vote. The countries exercising two votes on ECCI at the time of the 4th World Congress of the Comintern late in 1922 were Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Finland, and the United States. Although not originally envisioned as such, formal gatherings of the \\"Enlarged Executive Committee of the Communist International\\" rapidly came to supplant the World Congresses of the Comintern. The 4th World Congress established the Organization Bureau (\\"Orgburo\\") of the Comintern. This committee controlled placement of Comintern cadres throughout the world and supervised international agitation and propaganda work, leaving political questions to ECCI. The Comintern Orgburo was patterned after a similar institution in the Russian Communist Party that had been established in March 1919.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. xxix-xxx. The Zinoviev letter, purporting to be instructions to British communists to begin preparations for revolution, is on its face written as a letter from the ECCI on 15 September 1924.Lewis Chester, Stephen Fay, Hugo Young, \\"The Zinoviev Letter\\", Heinemann, 1967, p. xi. Although validated as genuine by the Secret Intelligence Service at the time,Keith Jeffery, \\"MI6: The History of the Secret Intelligence Service 1909-1949\\", Bloomsbury, 2010, p. 216-22. the letter is now accepted by the British government to have been a forgery. The loss of autonomy It was the Political Secretariat of the Comintern that de facto governed the Comintern, in Stalinist era intended to be an instrument of Soviet foreign policy.Erik P. Hoffmann, Soviet Foreign Policy Aims and Accomplishments from Lenin to Brezhnev, Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, Vol. 36, No. 4, Soviet Foreign Policy (1987), pp. 10-31 Subordination of national Communist Parties to the Communist International was complete: in any given country there can be only one Communist Party affiliated to the Communist International and each represented a Section of the Communist International in that country. The decisions of the ECCI were obligatory for all the Sections of the Communist International. And although the Sections had the right to appeal against decisions of the ECCI to the World Congress, they had to execute them, pending the decision of the World Congress. On the other hand, ECCI had the right “to expel from the Communist International, entire Sections, groups and individual members who violate the program and rules of the Communist International or the decisions of the World Congress and of the ECCI”.The Programme of the Communist International 1929.

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg\\".

The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 14. Anarchism is a far-left ideology. and much of anarchist economics and legal philosophy reflect anti- authoritarian, anti-statist and libertarian interpretations of radical left- wing and socialist politics such as communism, collectivism, free-market, individualism, mutualism, participism and syndicalism, among other libertarian socialist philosophies.\\"The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or \\"vulgar\\" communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out\\".

Many mutualists believe a market without government intervention drives prices down to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent and interest according to the labor theory of value. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.\\"Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.\\" From \\"Communism versus Mutualism\\", Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments. (Boston: Lee & Shepard, 1875) by William Batchelder Greene Some see mutualism as between individualist and collectivist anarchism.Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Princeton University Press 1996 , p. 6 Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 , p. 11 In What Is Property?, Proudhon develops a concept of \\"liberty\\", equivalent to \\"anarchy\\", which is the dialectical \\"synthesis of communism and property\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph What is Property? (1840), p. 281 Greene, influenced by Pierre Leroux, sought mutualism in the synthesis of three philosophies—communism, capitalism and socialism.Greene, William B. \\"Communism – Capitalism – Socialism \\", Equality (1849), p. 59. Later individualist anarchists used the term mutualism, but retained little emphasis on synthesis while social anarchists such as the authors of An Anarchist FAQ claim mutualism as a subset of their philosophical tradition.\\"Are there different types of social anarchism? \\", An Anarchist FAQ. Retrieved 13 December 2007.  Social anarchism  Social anarchism is a broad category of anarchism independent of individualist anarchism. Where individualist forms of anarchism emphasize personal autonomy and the rational nature of human beings, social anarchism sees \\"individual freedom as conceptually connected with social equality and emphasize community and mutual aid\\".Suissa, Judith(2001) \\"Anarchism, Utopias and Philosophy of Education\\", Journal of Philosophy of Education 35 (4), 627–46. Social anarchism is used to specifically describe anarchist tendencies within anarchism that have an emphasis on the communitarian and cooperative aspects of anarchist theory and practice. Social anarchism includes (but is not limited to) collectivist anarchism, anarcho- communism, libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism and social ecology.  Collectivist anarchism  Mikhail Bakunin Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionaryPatsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54 form of anarchism most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin, Johann Most and the anti-authoritarian section of the First International.Avrich, Paul. 2006. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. AK Press. p. 5 Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or \\"propaganda by the deed\\", which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed \\"according to need\\" as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.Bakunin's associate, James Guillaume, put it this way in his essay, Ideas on Social Organization(1876): Collective anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism, but it opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society.Bakunin, Mikhail; Statism and Anarchism: Some collectivist anarchists do not oppose the use of currency. Some support workers being paid based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase commodities in a communal market.Bakunin, Mikhail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369 This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods \\"to each according to his need\\". Many modern-day collectivist anarchists hold their form of anarchism as a permanent society rather than a carryover to anarcho-communism or a gift economy. Some collectivist anarchists such as proponents of participatory economics believe in remuneration and a form of credit but do not believe in money or markets. Although collectivist anarchism shares many similarities with anarchist communism, there are also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217 Also collectivist anarchists often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed \\"to each according to his or her need\\".  Anarcho-communism  Peter Kropotkin, who believed that in anarchy workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all of society Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property) and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\".Fabbri, Luigi. \\"Anarchism and Communism.\\" Northeastern Anarchist No. 4. 1922. 13 October 2002. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/worldwidemovements/fabbrianarandcom.htmlMakhno, Mett, Arshinov, Valevski, Linski (Dielo Trouda). \\"The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\\". 1926.

To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936] During the Russian Civil War, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine to create and defend anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. In 1929, anarcho-communism was achieved in Korea by the Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria (KAFM) and the Korean Anarcho-Communist Federation (KACF), with help from anarchist general and independence activist Kim Chwa-chin, lasting until 1931, when Imperial Japan assassinated Kim and invaded from the south while the Chinese Nationalists invaded from the north, resulting in the creation of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan. Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon; parts of Andalusia and the Levante; and in the stronghold of Revolutionary Catalonia, before being crushed by the combined forces of fascist Francoism, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as well as Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the Soviet Union and economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.Murray Bookchin. To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936]  Individualist anarchism  Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.\\"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.\\"Mini-Manual of Individualism by Han Ryner\\"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.\\"\\"Anarchism and the State\\" in Individual Liberty  Philosophical anarchism  William Godwin (1756–1836), liberal, utilitarian and individualist philosopher thought of as the founder of philosophical anarchism, in a portrait by Henry William Pickersgill In founding philosophical anarchism, William Godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to Peter Kropotkin, Godwin was \\"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\\".Peter Kropotkin, \\"Anarchism\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910 Philosophical anarchism contends that the state lacks moral legitimacy; that there is no individual obligation or duty to obey the state and conversely that the state has no right to command individuals, but it does not advocate revolution to eliminate the state. According to The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, philosophical anarchism \\"is a component especially of individualist anarchism\\".Outhwaite, William & Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing Philosophical anarchists may accept the existence of a minimal state as an unfortunate and usually temporary \\"necessary evil\\", but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.Klosko, George. Political Obligations. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4 As conceived by Godwin, it requires individuals to act in accordance with their own judgments and to allow every other individual the same liberty—conceived egoistically as by Max Stirner, it implies that \\"the unique one\\" who truly \\"owns himself\\" recognizes no duties to others; and within the limit of his might, he does what is right for him. Godwin opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present \\"necessary evil\\"Godwin: \\"...however we may be obliged to admit it as a necessary evil for the present, it behoves us, as the friends of reason and the human species, to admit as little of it as possible, and carefully to observe whether, in consequence of the gradual illumination of the human mind, that little may not hereafter be diminished.\\" \\"An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\\". . that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.\\"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.\\" – In Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Retrieved 7 December 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable. Rather than throwing bombs or taking up arms to bring down the state, philosophical anarchists \\"have worked for a gradual change to free the individual from what they thought were the oppressive laws and social constraints of the modern state and allow all individuals to become self-determining and value-creating\\".Murphy, Brenda. The Provinceton Platers and the Culture of Modernity. Cambridge University Press 2005. pp. 31–32. They may oppose the immediate elimination of the state by violent means out of concern that it would be left unsecured against the establishment of a more harmful and oppressive state. This is especially true among those anarchists who consider violence and the state as synonymous, or who consider it counterproductive where public reaction to violence results in increased \\"law enforcement\\" efforts.  Egoist anarchism  19th century philosopher Max Stirner, a prominent early individualist anarchist Egoist anarchism originated in the philosophy of Max Stirner, a 19th-century Hegelian philosopher whose \\"name appears with familiar regularity in historically orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism\\". Stirner's philosophy is usually called \\"egoism\\" as he says that the egoist rejects devotion to \\"a great idea, a cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling\\", saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather \\"lives themselves out\\" without regard to \\"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby\\".Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183 Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires.The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176 He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions – including the notion of state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very notion of society – were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wanted to \\"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members\\".Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96 Stirner's idea of the Union of egoists was first expounded in The Ego and Its Own. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the state. The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. The Union requires that all parties participate out of a conscious egoism. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up with it and keeps up appearances, the Union has degenerated into something else. This Union is not seen as an authority above a person's own will. This idea has received interpretations for politics, economic and sex/love. Although Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced anarcho- communists. \\"For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management\\" discusses Stirner and speaks of a \\"communist egoism\\", which is said to be a \\"synthesis of individualism and collectivism\\" and says that \\"greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society\\".For Ourselves, The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything, 1974. Forms of libertarian communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are influenced by Stirner.Alfredo M. Bonanno . The Theory of the Individual: Stirner's Savage Thought] Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own.Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50. The Scottish born German writer John Henry Mackay found out about Stirner while reading a copy of Friedrich Albert Lange's History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance. Later, Mackay looked for a copy of The Ego and Its Own and after being fascinated with it he wrote a biography of Stirner (Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk), published in German in 1898.\\"IDEAS OF MAX STIRNER.; First English Translation of His Book, \\"The Ego and His Own\\" – His Attack on Socialism – The Most Revolutionary Book Ever Published.\\" by JAMES HUNEKER Mackay's propaganda of stirnerist egoism and of male homosexual and bisexual rights affected Adolf Brand, who in 1896 published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, Der Eigene.Karl Heinrich Ulrichs had begun a journal called Prometheus in 1870, but only one issue was published. Kennedy, Hubert, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality, In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario (pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997. Another later German anarchist publication influenced deeply by Stirner was Der Einzige. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseudonym for Salomo Friedlaender). Stirnerian egoism became a main influence on European individualist anarchism including its main proponents in the early 20th century such as Emile Armand and Han Ryner in France, Renzo Novatore in Italy, Miguel Giménez Igualada in Spain and in Russia Lev Chernyi. Illegalism was an anarchist practice that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s that found justification in Stirner's philosophy.Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. The illegalists openly embraced criminality as a lifestyle. Some American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner's egoist anarchism. John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called \\"Egoism\\" in which he states that \\"[m]odern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual\\". Anarchist communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin as well as the Russian strain of individualist anarchism and blended these philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays.Levy, Carl. \\"Anarchism\\".

Enrico Arrigoni (pseudonym: Frank Brand) was an Italian American individualist anarchist Lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Stirner.Paul Avrich. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. Stirner's philosophy also found followers in Colombia in Biófilo Panclasta and in Japan in Jun Tsuji and Sakae Osugi. In the 1980s, it emerged in the United States the tendency of post-left anarchy which was influenced profoundly by Stirnerist egoism in aspects such as the critique of ideology.  Individualist anarchism in the United States  Benjamin Tucker, American individualist anarchist Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchistPalmer, Brian (29 December 2010) What do anarchists want from us?, Slate.com and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published,.William Bailie, Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist – A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20 For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \\"[i]t is apparent...that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews...William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\\".Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism by Eunice Minette Schuster Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his books Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later, Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty. An important concern for American individualist anarchism was free love. Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women—for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker,Joanne E. Passet, \\"Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,\\" in: Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50. but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's 'The Word' (1872–1890, 1892–1893). Free Society (1895–1897 as The Firebrand; 1897–1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.\\"Free Society was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.\\" Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909, p. 551. The publication staunchly advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued \\"Comstockery\\" – censorship of sexual information. Also M. E. Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love. Freethought also motivated activism in this movement. \\"Freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\\". \\"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\\".  Individualist anarchism in Europe  Émile Armand, influential French individualist anarchist and free love propagandist European Individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by William Godwin,Woodcock, George. 2004. Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 20. Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Max Stirner. Proudhon was an early pioneer of anarchism as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of mutualism. Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work The Ego and Its Own which is considered to be \\"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\\". Another early figure was Anselme Bellegarrigue. Individualist anarchism expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from North American individualist anarchism. European individualist anarchists include Max Stirner, Albert Libertad, Anselme Bellegarrigue, Émile Armand, Enrico Arrigoni, Lev Chernyi, John Henry Mackay, Han Ryner, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Giménez Igualada and currently Michel Onfray. Two influential authors in European individualist anarchists are Friedrich Nietzsche (see Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche) and Georges Palante. From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of French individualist anarchism. An early figure was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Autonomie Individuelle was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme. This tradition later continued with such intellectuals as Albert Libertad, André Lorulot, Emile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean, who in 1905 developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, L'Anarchie. Outside this journal, Han Ryner wrote Petit Manuel individualiste (1903) and later appeared the journal L'En-Dehors created by Zo d'Axa in 1891. French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. Anarcho- naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist \\"partisan of the milieux libres, publisher of \\"Flambeau\\" (\\"an enemy of authority\\") in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several. \\"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of birth control methods, the idea of \\"unions of egoists\\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others\\". IllegalismThe \\"Illegalists\\" , by Doug Imrie (published by Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed) is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner's individualist anarchism.\\"Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.\\"Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.\\" Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of \\"might\\" rather than \\"right\\" and for the most part illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15 although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed. The illegalists embraced direct action and propaganda by the deed. Spain received the influence of American individualist anarchism but most importantly it was related to the French currents. At the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain takes force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales and J. Elizalde, who will translate French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen and Nosotros. In Germany, the Scottish-German John Henry McKay became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirnerist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. BIn 1896, Brand published a German homosexual periodical, Der Eigene. The Irish anarchist writer of the Decadent movement Oscar Wilde influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore\\"We must kill the christian philosophy in the most radical sense of the word. How much mostly goes sneaking inside the democratic civilization (this most cynically ferocious form of christian depravity) and it goes more towards the categorical negation of human Individuality. \\"Democracy!

Anarchist Studies. 23 (1): 47. In his work Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, published 1962, Woodcock wrote that after 1936 it was \\"a ghost that inspires neither fear among governments nor hope among peoples nor even interest among newspapermen\\".Woodcock, George (1962). Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. \\"Epilogue\\". Melbourne: Penguin. p. 468. Capitalism continued to grow throughout the post- war period despite predictions from Marxist scholars that it would soon collapse under its own contradictions, yet anarchism gained a surprising surge in popular interest during the 1960s. Reasons for this were believed to be the gradual demystification of the Soviet Union and tensions at the climax of the Cold War.Thomas, Paul (1985). Karl Marx and the Anarchists. London: Routledge/Kegan Paul. p. 4. .Marshall, Peter (1993). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. Fontana. p. 539. . The New Left which arose in the 1950s was a libertarian socialist movement that was closer to anarchism. Prominent thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse and C. Wright Mills were critical of the United States and Soviet Marxism.Marshall, Peter (1993). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. Fontana. pp. 540–542. .  Insurrectionary anarchism  Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes the theme of insurrection within anarchist practice. It opposes formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists support informal organization and small affinity group based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies. Contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti- organizational anarcho-communism and illegalism. Important theorists within it include Alfredo Maria Bonanno and Wolfi Landstreicher.  Green anarchism  Green anarchismDavid Pepper (1996). Modern Environmentalism p. 44. Routledge. is a school of thought within anarchism which puts an emphasis on environmental issues.Ian Adams (2001). Political Ideology Today p. 130. Manchester University Press. An important early influence was the thought of the American anarchist Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden\\"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por John Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\\"\\"LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA.

EL ANARQUISMO INDIVIDUALISTA ESPAÑOL DURANTE LA DICTADURA Y LA SEGUNDA REPÚBLICA (1923–1938)\\" by Xavier Diez Important contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology. Notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include Murray Bookchin, Daniel Chodorkoff, anthropologist Brian Morris and people around Institute for Social Ecology; and those critical of technology such as Layla AbdelRahim, Derrick Jensen, George Draffan and John Zerzan; and others such as Alan Carter. Social ecologists, also considered a kind of socialist anarchist, often criticize the main currents of anarchism for their focus and debates about politics and economics instead of a focus on eco-system (human and environmental). This theory promotes libertarian municipalism and green technology. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize mainstream anarchism for supporting civilization and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation. They instead advocate the process of rewilding or reconnecting with the natural environment. Veganarchism is the political philosophy of veganism (more specifically animal liberation) and green anarchism.Dominick, Brian. Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism, third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, pp. 1, 5 and 6. This encompasses viewing the state as unnecessary and harmful to both human and animals whilst practising a vegan diet. John Zerzan, important theorist of anarcho-primitivism  Anarcho-primitivism  Anarcho-primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion and alienation. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-\\"civilized\\" ways of life through deindustrialisation, abolition of the division of labour or specialization and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies. There are other non- anarchist forms of primitivism and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern, civilized problems. Many traditional anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some such as Wolfi Landstreicher endorse the critique but do not consider themselves anarcho- primitivists. Some anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through \\"rewilding\\".  Anarcho-naturism  Anarcho-naturism appeared in the late 19th century as the union of anarchist and naturist philosophies.\\"Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related.\\"\\"Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism\\" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ADN. Winter 2003\\"In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s, nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life. In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity.\\"\\"Nudism the radical tradition\\" by Terry Phillips Mainly it had importance within individualist anarchist circles\\"Los anarco- individualistas, G.I.A...Una escisión de la FAI producida en el IX Congreso (Carrara, 1965) se pr odujo cuando un sector de anarquistas de tendencia humanista rechazan la interpretación que ellos juzgan disciplinaria del \\"pacto asociativo\\" clásico, y crean los GIA (Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica). Esta pequeña federación de grupos, hoy nutrida sobre todo de veteranos anarco- individualistas de orientación pacifista, naturista, etcétera defiende la autonomía personal y rechaza a rajatabla toda forma de intervención en los procesos del sistema, como sería por ejemplo el sindicalismo.

Anarcho-naturism advocated vegetarianism, free love, nudism, hiking and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them. Anarcho-naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small ecovillages and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity.\\"EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890–1939)\\" by Josep Maria Rosell. \\"el individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social.\\" Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and tried to eliminate social determinations.  Social ecology  Social ecology is a philosophy developed by Murray Bookchin in the 1960s which holds that present ecological problems are rooted in deep-seated social problems, particularly in dominatory hierarchical political and social systems. These have resulted in an uncritical acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as ethical consumerism, but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radical democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and with nature is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.Bookchin, Murray. The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy. Oakland: AK Press, 2005, p. 85-87.  Anarcha-feminism  Emma Goldman, important anarcha-feminist writer and activist Anarcha-feminism is a form of anarchism that synthesizes radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary hierarchy which anarchists often oppose. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage. For instance, the feminist anarchist Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that \\"[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life\\".Goldman, \\"Marriage and Love\\", Red Emma Speaks, p. 205 Anarcha-feminists also often criticize the views of some of the traditional anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin who believed that patriarchy is only a minor problem and is dependent only on the existence of the state and capitalism and will disappear soon after such institutions are abolished. Anarcha-feminists by contrast view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the state and capitalism. As Susan Brown puts it, \\"as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist\\".Brown, Susan. \\"Beyond Feminism: Anarchism and Human Freedom\\" 'Anarchist Papers 3' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208  Anarcho-pacifism  Henry David Thoreau, early influence on anarcho-pacifism Anarcho-pacifism is a form of anarchism which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was Henry David Thoreau who through his work Civil Disobedience influenced both Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Gandhi's advocacy of nonviolent resistance. As a global movement, anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before World War II in the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for nuclear disarmament. Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced propaganda of the deed, Leo Tolstoy and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. Tolstoy argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent, since it is by definition opposition to coercion and force and that since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Gandhi, an Indian independence leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement. In France in December 1902, Georges Yvetot was one of the founders of the Ligue antimilitariste, along with fellow anarchists Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and Émile Janvion. The Ligue antimilitariste was to become the French section of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA) founded in Amsterdam in 1904.  Religious anarchism  Leo Tolstoy, theorist of Christian anarchism Religious anarchism is a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to organized religion.Walter, Nicolas \\"Anarchism and Religion\\", South Place Ethical Society, 14 July 1991. Hosted at the Spunk Library. Many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably Christianity, as Christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Non-Christian forms of religious anarchism include Buddhist anarchism, Jewish anarchism and most recently Neopaganism. Neopaganism focuses on the sanctity of the environment and equality and is often of a decentralized nature. This led to a number of Neopagan-inspired anarchists, one of the most prominent of which is Starhawk, who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism.  Christian anarchism  Christian anarchism is a form of religious anarchism that seeks to combine anarchism with Christianity, claiming that anarchism is justified by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Early Christian communities have been described by Christian anarchists and some historians as possessing anarcho-communist characteristics. Christian anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Ammon Hennacy believe that the teachings of Paul of Tarsus caused a shift from the earlier more egalitarian and anarchistic teachings of Jesus. However, others believe that Paul with his strong emphasis on God's Providence is to be understood as a holding to anarchist principles.  Anarchism without adjectives  Voltairine de Cleyre In the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, anarchism without adjectives \\"referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, [...] [i]t was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools\\".Esenwein, George Richard \\"Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898\\" [p. 135] Anarchism without adjectives emphasizes harmony between various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs. The expression was coined by Cuban-born Fernando Tarrida del Mármol, who used it in Barcelona in November 1889 as a call for tolerance, after being troubled by the \\"bitter debates\\" between the different movements.Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6 Rudolf Rocker said that the different types of anarchism presented \\"only different methods of economy, the practical possibilities of which have yet to be tested, and that the first objective is to secure the personal and social freedom of men no matter upon which economics basis this is to be accomplished\\".Quoted in Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 7 Voltairine de Cleyre was an anarchist without adjectives who initially identified herself as an individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism, while refusing to identify herself with any of the contemporary schools (\\"The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether . . . Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises\\").Voltairine De Cleyre, \\"Why I Am an Anarchist\\" She commented that \\"Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom\\" although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic (\\"There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [these systems] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to\\"). Errico Malatesta was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that \\"[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses\\".quoted by Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism. p. 198-99 == Contemporary anarchism == Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools have appeared. Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber has posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those \\"who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the last century\\" contrasted with the younger activists who are \\"much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas\\" and who by the start of the 21st century formed \\"by far the majority\\" of anarchists. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within post-classical and contemporary currents.Williams, Dana M. (2018). \\"Contemporary anarchist and anarchistic movements\\". Sociology Compass. Wiley. 12 (6): 4. . . Anarchists are committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \\"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\\". Anarchist schools of thought disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.Jun, Nathan (September 2009). \\"Anarchist Philosophy and Working Class Struggle: A Brief History and Commentary\\". WorkingUSA. 12 (3): 507–508. . . For the English anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, \\"contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism. One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally\\".Critchley, Simon (2007). Infinitely Demanding. Verso. p. 125. This might also have been motivated by \\"the collapse of 'really existing socialism' and the capitulation to neo-liberalism of Western social democracy\\".El-Ojeili, Chamsy (2015). Beyond Post-Socialism. Dialogues with the Far-Left. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 7.  Anarcho-transhumanism  Anarcho-transhumanism is the synthesis of anarchism with transhumanism that is concerned with both social and physical freedom, respectively. Anarcho-transhumanists define freedom as the expansion of one's own ability to experience the world around them. The philosophy draws heavily from the individualist anarchism of William Godwin and Voltairine de Cleyre as well as the cyberfeminism presented by Donna Haraway in A Cyborg Manifesto. It looks at issues surrounding bodily autonomy, disability, gender, neurodiversity, queer theory science and sexuality. Anarcho-transhumanism presents a critique through an anarchist and transhumanist lens of ableism, cisheteropatriarchy and primitivism. Anarcho-transhumanists also criticise non-anarchist forms of transhumanism such as democratic transhumanism and libertarian transhumanism as incoherent and unsurvivable due to their preservation of capitalism and the state. They view such instruments of power as inherently unethical and incompatible with the acceleration of social and material freedom for all individuals.  Post-anarchism  Post-anarchism is articulated by Saul Newman as a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Although it first received popular attention in his book From Bakunin to Lacan, it has taken on a life of its own subsequent to Newman's use of the term and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless, key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.  Post-left anarchy  Bob Black, writer associated to post-left anarchism Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional leftism. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organizations and morality. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation. The magazines Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, Green Anarchy and Fifth Estate have been involved in developing post-left anarchy. Individual writers associated with the tendency are Hakim Bey, Bob Black, John Zerzan, Jason McQuinn, Fredy Perlman, Lawrence Jarach and Wolfi Landstreicher. The contemporary network of collectives CrimethInc. is an exponent of post-left anarchist views.  Queer anarchism  Queer anarchists protesting for equal rights Queer anarchism suggests anarchism as a means of queer liberation and solution to the issues faced by the LGBT community such as homophobia, lesbophobia, transmisogyny, biphobia, transphobia, heteronormativity, patriarchy and the gender binary. People who campaigned for LGBT rights both outside and inside the anarchist and LGBT movements include John Henry Mackay,\\"The story of one person's struggle against intolerance and repression during the early 20th century homosexual emancipation movement in Germany. Mackay is a very interesting figure in both anarchist and homosexual circles.\\"Hubert Kennedy. Anarchist Of Love: The Secret Life Of John Henry Mackay. Adolf Brand and Daniel Guérin.\\"Although by 1968 he could be seen as the “grandfather of the French homosexual movement” , Daniel Guérin has always been better known outside gay circles for his rôle in the revolutionary movement. On the revolutionary left of the Socialist Party in the 1930s, he was later heavily influenced by Trotsky, before becoming attracted to the libertarian communist wing of the anarchist movement.\\" David Berry. \\"For a dialectic of homosexuality and revolution\\" Individualist anarchist Adolf Brand published Der Eigene from 1896 to 1932 in Berlin, the first sustained journal dedicated to gay issues.Karl Heinrich Ulrichs had begun a journal called Uranus in 1870, but only one issue (\\"Prometheus\\") was published.

New York: Routledge, 1997. == Types of organization == Anarchists creates different forms of organization to meet each other, share information, organize struggles and trace ways to spread the anarchist ideas through the world. Those organizations tend to be structured around the principles of anarchism, i.e. without hierarchy, coercion, and with voluntary association, since they understand that the only way to achieve a free and egualitarian society in the end is through equally free and egualitarian means.  Synthesis anarchism  Sebastien Faure Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchist organization which tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.\\"J.3.2 What are 'synthesis' federations?\\". An Anarchist FAQ. It intends to bringing together anarchists of the anarchists main tendencies, namely individualist anarchism, anarchist communism and mutualism.

It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.  Platformism  Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement which shares an affinity with organising in the tradition of Dielo Truda's Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft). The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution which led eventually to the victory of Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other like-minded groups. The Platform attempted to explain and address the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution. As a controversial pamphlet, the document drew both praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide. Today, platformism is an important current in international anarchism. Around thirty platformists and specifists are linked together in the Anarkismo project, including groups from Africa, Europe, Latin America and North America.Anarkismo (2012). \\"About Us\\".

Anarcho-syndicalism  May Day 2010 demonstration of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT in Bilbao, Basque Country In the early 20th century, anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism. More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles of syndicalism include workers' solidarity, direct action (such as general strikes and workplace recuperations) and workers' self-management. Anarcho-syndicalism and other branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution. According to the writers of An Anarchist FAQ, anarcho-syndicalist economic systems often take the form of either an anarcho-communist or collectivist anarchist economic system. Rudolf Rocker is considered a leading anarcho-syndicalist theorist. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet Anarchosyndicalism.Anarchosyndicalism by Rudolph Rocker '.' Retrieved 7 September 2006. Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in France and Spain), many syndicalist organizations are active today, including the SAC in Sweden, the USI in Italy and the CNT in Spain. A number of these organizations are united across national borders by membership in the International Workers Association. == See also == * Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism * Anarchism and the arts * Anarchism and capitalism * Anarchism and education * Anarchism and nationalism * Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche * Anarchism and violence * Definition of anarchism and libertarianism * Epistemological anarchism * Issues in anarchism * Left-libertarianism * Left-wing market anarchism * Libertarianism * Panarchism == External links == * == References == Schools of thought Category:Issues in anarchism Category:Philosophical movements ","title":"Anarchist schools of thought"},{"id":"46399294","text":"Collectivist anarchism, Avrich, Paul (1995) [2005].

For the collectivization of the means of production, collectivist anarchism originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.Bakunin, Mikhail [1980]. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. p. 369.

As if these men had dropped from the skies, bringing with them speech, will, original thought, and as if they were alien to anything of the earth, that is, anything having social origin\\". While individualist anarchists advocate free-market anarchism and support mutualist property rights, seeing state interventions as distorting free competition, collectivist anarchists see such interventions as \\"merely prop up\\" for a \\"system of class exploitation\\", giving capitalism \\"a human face\\". == First International == Collectivist anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, whose anti-authoritarian majority created their own International Giuseppe Fanelli met Bakunin at Ischia in 1866. In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to Barcelona to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the International. Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the Spanish exiles, the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest anarchist movement in modern Europe. Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse. Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid. Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including Anselmo Lorenzo, to the First National. In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona. He met with painter Josep Lluís Pellicer and his cousin Rafael Farga i Pellicer, along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona as well as the Alliance section. In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in Lyon on the principles later exemplified by the Paris Commune, calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the Franco-Prussian War, seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution, or what Vladimir Lenin later termed revolutionary defeatism. In his Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis, Bakunin also argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self- governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action, saying that \\"we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.Bakunin, Mikhail (1870). \\"Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis\\". These ideas corresponded strikingly close with the program of the Paris Commune in 1871, much of which was developed by followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as Marxists were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Paris Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Paris Commune as above all a \\"rebellion against the State\\" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.Bakunin, Mikhail (1871). \\"The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State\\". In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Paris Commune and the International against the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term collectivism to distinguish themselves from the mutualism of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with Karl Marx. In his 1867 essay \\"Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism\\", Bakunin wrote that \\"we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism\\" which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian. IWA at the Basel Congress in 1869 Bakunin's disagreements with Marx which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress in 1872 illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was \\"Marx's flamboyant chief opponent\\" and \\"presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people\\".Verslius, Arthur (20 June 2005) \\"Death of the Left?\\" The American Conservative. . Retrieved 20 October 2010. The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own International at the 1872 St. Imier Congress, adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.Graham, Robert (March 2005). Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939). Black Rose Books. Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx's class analysis and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging \\"Marx's genius\\", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized authoritarian socialism which he associated with Marxism and the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat which he adamantly refused. Indeed, Bakunin's maxim was that \\"[i]f you took the most ardent revolutionary, vested him in absolute power, within a year he would be worse than the Tsar himself.Quoted in Guérin, Daniel (1970). Anarchism: From Theory to Practice. New York: Monthly Review Press. pp. 25–26. The anti-authoritarian sections of the International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that \\"the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government\\" in which each worker will have the \\"right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting\\". This revolutionary transformation could \\"only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes\\".Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One. Black Rose Books. Retrieved 12 July 2013. A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the International Jose Llunas Pujols in his essay \\"Collectivism\\". By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarcho-communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the collectivist label then became more commonly associated with nominally state socialists such as Marxists–Leninists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism. The anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin attacked this position in his essay \\"The Collectivist Wages System\\" which was reprinted in his book The Conquest of Bread in 1892. == Theory == Bakunin's libertarian socialism was known as collectivist anarchism, where \\"socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor\\".Bakunin, Mikhail (1866). Revolutionary Catechism. Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.  Critique of Marxism  Statism and Anarchy by Bakunin, Russian first print (1873) The dispute between Bakunin and Marx highlighted the differences between anarchism and Marxism. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a concept that vanguardist socialism such as Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.Woodcock, George (1962) [1975]. Anarchism. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. p. 158. . For instance, Bakunin stated the following in Statism and Anarchy about this Marxist concept: Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any \\"enlightened elite\\" must only exert influence by remaining \\"invisible [...] not imposed on anyone [...] [and] deprived of all official rights and significance\\". He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression. While both anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, egalitarian society without social classes and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists, especially social anarchists, believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the direct action of the masses, culminating in social revolution and refusing any intermediate stage such as the dictatorship of the proletariat on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self- perpetuating fundament. However, libertarian Marxists argue that Marx used the phrase to mean that the worker control at the point of production and not a party would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists \\"anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved\\". Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844 as such: Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating Das Kapital into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that \\"[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader\\".Marx, Karl (2 October 1852); Engels, Friedrich, ed. (1896). \\"Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany\\". New-York Daily Tribune. Marx wrote to Friedrich Engels of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: \\"On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further\\".Quoted in Morris, Brian (1993). Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. p. 29. Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the \\"new class\\", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the \\"[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine\\". Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such, \\"[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion\\". Bakunin \\"considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work. [...] [I]n short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat\\".Thoburn, Nicholas (2002). \\"The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable\\". In Deleuze, Marx and Politics (2003). \\"Difference in Marx: the lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnamable\\".  Comparison with anarcho-communism  An example of a collective cooperative market which collectivist anarchists seek to create The difference between collectivist anarchism and anarcho-communism is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Like collectivist anarchism, anarcho-communism also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of \\"to each according to his labor\\", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim \\"to each according to his needs\\".This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Skinner, Quentin; Guess, Raymond (1995). The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings. Cambridge University Press. p. xvi. Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while anarcho-communism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho- communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists such as Bakunin believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists such as Peter Kropotkin believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. Thus, it could be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could also be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism. Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of labour vouchers or \\"personal credit\\" (such as participatory economists). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would \\"guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society\\".Guillaume, James (1972). Bakunin on Anarchism. p. 376. They argue for workplace autonomy and self-management, saying that \\"the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'\\".Guillaume, James (1972).

He went on to play another four seasons with the side in Superettan, the Swedish second tier, as a regular. During this period, he also won several caps for the Swedish national U17's and 19's. Hammarby Before the start of the 2013 season, he was transferred to fellow Superettan-club Hammarby. Besara signed a three year-deal with the club, but enjoyed a rough first season at his new side, when then manager Gregg Berhalter opted to play him out of position as a striker. During the later stage of the 2014 season, Besara flourished under the new manager Nanne Bergstrand. He scored a hattrick on match day 28, in a 4–2 win against Östersund on home turf, which consolidated Hammarby's top position in the league. A few weeks later, the club won their promotion to Allsvenskan. During the 2015 season, Besara featured as a key player in his first ever Allsvenskan season. On match day 3, in a derby against Djurgårdens IF, he scored the decisive goal in a 2–1 victory. The goal was scored with his back heel, with football pundit Jens Fjellström comparing his move with those of the Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimović. Göztepe In July 2015, he transferred to the newly promoted Turkish second tier club Göztepe. During the following campaign he played 15 competitive games, scoring once, before terminating his contract by mutual consent in the summer of 2016. Örebro Besara then opted to return to his native country, signing a two and a half-year deal with Örebro on 11 August 2016. The following month he returned to Tele2 Arena with Örebro to face Hammarby, his former side. Besara scored the equalising goal in stoppage time, settling the score at 1-1. However, he chose not to celebrate the goal out of compassion for the supporters' of his old club. In 2017, Besara established himself as one of the most affluent offensive players in Allsvenskan. In 30 games, he scored 10 goals and provided 7 assists, thus gathering the third most points of all players in the league.  Al-Fayha  On 25 January 2019, Besara signed for Al-Fayha in the Saudi Professional League.  Pafos  On 20 August 2019, Besara joined Pafos FC in the Cypriot First Division.

The game was unveiled on July 29, 2014, after a long time of quiet development of the game that originated as a 3D shooter for the Nintendo DS in 2005. The game uses the same engine as Toki Tori 2+ and was developed by a three-man core team. ==Gameplay== Rive is a classic 2D side-scrolling platformer mixed with shooting elements, with the ability to shoot in full 360 degrees around the player character who gains the ability to \\"alter the behavior of their robotic enemies by collecting and uploading hacks\\". The game features a mission system and high scores for players to come back to after completing the game's story. ==Development== Rive was originally confirmed to be in development for the Wii U since September 2014, and a demo version was even included in the Wii U eShop's promotional \\"Nindies@Home\\" campaign in June 2015. Although the title was originally intended to release in September 2016 on the Wii U alongside other platforms, in an interview with Nintendo Life in July 2016, Two Tribes co-founder Collin van Ginkel expressed scepticism regarding the game's release for the console due to technical difficulties maintaining the title's optimal performance. Van Ginkel added if the Wii U build fails to reach expectations, they would move the title to the upcoming Nintendo Switch, then known as \\"NX\\". In February 2017, Two Tribes confirmed Rive for Nintendo Switch, dropping the Wii U version. The Switch version was developed in collaboration with Engine Software. It includes an exclusive Copilot Mode, which allows two players to control the same ship co-operatively using each Joy-Con, as well as improved performance over the PlayStation 4 version running 60 frames per second at 1080p.

Upon his arrival with his interpreter Major Maass. Lanz states that the moment command was transferred to him was \\"the proudest in this war\\". When Lanz went to Sark on 3 July to see Dame Sybil Hathaway, she noted that \\"Lanz was a tall, alert, quick-spoken officer, with dark hair and dark eyes. In civilian life he had been a Doctor of both Law and Philosophy, and I believe he came from a family of agricultural machinery manufacturers in Stuttgart [...] a fair minded man who would never trick anyone by low cunning\\". Ambrose Sherwill stated that he was \\"every inch a soldier and not very easy to get to know but absolutely straight and kindly\\". Lanz was given a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 4 September 1940. It was noted in Die Wehrmacht in 1940, and an American military translation revealed the following. Whilst the German forces were attacking Belgium, specifically during the crossing of the River Lys, around Theilt (potentially Thielt). The battalion was attempting to attack Gothem, a village, on the 24 May 1940, but beaten back. The battalion again tried on the 26 May through grain fields with limited visibility due to the grain, and under enemy fire, the attack was failing. Lanz organised the group and they attacked successfully, taking several enemies prisoner. However, he left the post at the rank of Oberstleutnant and later transferred to the Eastern Front. There, it was stated of Lanz and his regiment, the 396th Infantry Regiment, \\"I envy the men under this wonderful leader and person. He's a man who has intelligence written all over his tanned face, which is full of humour. He has a kind word or a joke for everyone\\". He died on the Eastern Front on the 27 January 1942 at Lazerett in Smolensk, Soviet Union in hospital of wounds he sustained. ==Awards== *Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 20px on 4 September 1940 as Major and commander of the I./Infanterie-Regiment 396Fellgiebel 2000, p. 285. ==References== Citations Bibliography * * Category:Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross Category:1898 births Category:1942 deaths Category:German military personnel killed in World War II Category:People from Tübingen (district) ","title":"Albrecht Lanz"},{"id":"46399845","text":"Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is an NHS trust responsible for the management of Kettering General Hospital and a new outpatient centre in Irthlingborough, East Northamptonshire. ==History== Kettering General came under the management of a separate NHS Trust in 1994.

In 2008 Rogers co-authored a casebook, Religious Freedom and the Supreme Court, published by Baylor University Press. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Rogers to serve as the chair of his Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, a panel of faith and civic leaders from different religious and political backgrounds. In 2010, President Obama issued an executive order instructing federal agencies to implement a number of the panel's recommendations. That year Rogers led a group of religious and civil rights leaders in drafting Religious Expression in American Public Life: A Joint Statement of Current Law, which indicates their points of agreement with the law of church and state as it applies to religious expression in the public square.

Before her appointment, Rogers had been critical of the Obama administration's handling of some church-state issues in an interview with the Huffington Post with respect to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. She stated that the administration erred in only exempting houses of worship from the ACA's requirement that employers include contraception coverage in their health insurance policies. Her ideas later became the basis for the administration's accommodation of the interests of a wider set of religious entities. In 2014, the Baptist Joint Committee gave Rogers its J.M.

This marked the second edition of the Continental Cup to be held outside of Canada. The Continental Cup featured team events, mixed doubles events, and skins competitions, with most points available in the skins competitions. TSN broadcast the event, as it had in previous years. The total attendance for the event was 62,498, the highest in Cup history (as of 2017).http://www.curling.ca/2017continentalcup/2017/01/16/team-north-america- captures-title-at-2017-world-financial-group-continental-cup/ ==Competition format== This edition of the Continental Cup used a similar format as that of the previous year, with the main difference being the elimination of the singles event, which was replaced by an additional mixed doubles event. Out of the sixty total points available, a majority of points were needed to win the cup. The mixed doubles, and team games were worth one point each, with ties being worth one half point each to both teams. The skins games were worth a total of five points. Six mixed doubles and six singles games were played, along with eighteen team games and six skins games. ==Teams== The teams were selected from the top teams in each region. Six teams from each region competed against each other in the competition. Four teams from Canada earned the right to represent Team North America by virtue of winning certain events, namely the Canada Cup of Curling and the Canadian National Championships (the Brier and the Tournament of Hearts). Two teams from the United States, namely the winners of the United States National Championships, were chosen to represent North America, and the teams representing Team World were selected by the World Curling Federation. The teams in the table below were announced as representatives of their respective regions. For Team North America, the teams participating included Canada Cup champions Kevin Koe and Rachel Homan, Tournament of Hearts champion Jennifer Jones, Brier champion Pat Simmons, and United States national champions Erika Brown and John Shuster.

Between 1992 and 1999, the group put on over 80 events in 21 different venues showcasing around 1300 films by 700 film makers. Film maker Asif Kapadia profiled Exploding Cinema in a 30 minute program for BBC Radio 4 in 2011. ==History== The Exploding Cinema was founded at the Cooltan Arts Centre, a squatted suntan lotion factory in Brixton, South London in 1991. The Cooltan was an underground arts complex with a theatre, gallery, practical workshops and regular raves. The original group was mostly film makers and the earliest shows were made up of their own films and performances. From the early 1990s onwards, the collective became the key agent in the resurgence of underground cinema in Britain. Through screenings, events, agitation and propaganda they developed and inspired a new popular movement of independent live cinema and D.I.Y. filmmaking. Over twenty five years the group has screened thousands of unfunded no-budget films/videos in pubs, squats, clubs, microcinemas and cafes. They staged one off shows in disused factories, ships, museums, car parks, roofs, a circus tent and an outdoor swimming pool. Internationally they have staged shows in Ireland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Malta, North America and Australia. An offshoot of the group operated in Amsterdam. ==References * Official website * Vimeo channel of the Exploding Cinema Collective * Exploding Cinema profiled on BBC Radio 4 in 2011 Category:Film collectives ","title":"Exploding cinema"},{"id":"46399949","text":"Ninian Edwards Gray (1807-November 18, 1859), generally known as N.

The Tool Committee and New Space Committee are used on both a temporary and permanent basis to meet requirements of the organization. ==Services== Collections The tool library adapted Share Starter's free \\"Tool Library Starter Kit\\" How to start a tool library which includes start up guidelines, frequently asked questions, and sample documents. The library uses \\"Local Tools\\" from \\"myTurn.com, PBC\\", a web-based inventory management system to track tool library members and to automatically display the tool availability online.Local Tools The LTL has 367+ specialized tools from power drills and ladders to pressure washers and roto-tillers to loan to community members with all skill levels welcomed. The inventory of equipment includes automotive, bike, carpentry and woodworking, electrical and soldering, home maintenance, metalworking, plumbing, remodelling, and yard and garden. The types of equipment include: hand tools, and power tools. Training The LTL offers workshops open both to Tool Library members and the public on tool related skills and projects. In the Intro to Tools workshop, participants built a planter box; while in Routers 101, attendees created a cutting board. ==Mission== Tool library The Tool library performs the following main tasks: *Tool Lending: all kinds for use in volunteer projects, facility maintenance and improvement projects, community improvement events, and special events. *Tool Advocacy: for the complete and timely return of all borrowed tools, to guarantee the long-term sustainability of available inventory. Staff also seeks compensation for lost tools and tools returned late. *Tool Maintenance: performing routine maintenance and repairs on all equipment to ensure good condition and to extend the lifespan of the inventory. This function is typically performed by volunteers and community service workers.

Contested over 511 laps—extended from 500 laps due to a green–white–checker finish—on the concrete short track, it was the eighth race of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Matt Kenseth won the race – his first victory since 2013 – while Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon finished second and third. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Ryan Newman rounded out the top five. Kenseth won the pole for the race and led 47 laps. Kevin Harvick led a race high 184 laps before getting caught in a late race wreck and finished outside the top ten for the first time in 2015. The race had 21 lead changes among six different drivers, as well as eleven caution flag periods for 117 laps. The race was also stopped three times, for a total duration of 4 hours and 36 minutes for rain. Kenseth's victory – his 32nd in Sprint Cup – ended a 51-race winless streak commencing after his victory at the 2013 Sylvania 300. It was his fourth win at Bristol and the eighth at the track for Joe Gibbs Racing. The win moved Kenseth up to eighth in the points standings. Despite the win, Toyota still trailed Chevrolet by 46–points in the manufacturer standings. The race was carried by Fox Sports on the broadcast Fox network for the American television audience, while the radio broadcast was carried by the Performance Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. ==Report== Background Bristol Motor Speedway, the track where the race was held. Bristol Motor Speedway, formerly known as Bristol International Raceway and Bristol Raceway, is a NASCAR short track venue located in Bristol, Tennessee. Constructed in 1960, it held its first NASCAR race on July 30, 1961. Despite its short length, Bristol is among the most popular tracks on the NASCAR schedule because of its distinct features, which include extraordinarily steep banking, an all concrete surface, two pit roads, and stadium-like seating. Kevin Harvick entered Bristol with a 26-point lead over Joey Logano, with Martin Truex, Jr. a further 14 points in arrears in third place. Brad Keselowski entered 60 back in fourth place, while Kasey Kahne completed the top five in the championship standings, 76 behind Harvick. Changes to the track In the wake of Kyle Busch's double leg-breaking crash in February's Alert Today Florida 300 at Daytona International Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway announced on April 3 that SAFER barriers had been installed along the entire circumference of the outer wall. Previously, the track had barriers only in the turns. Track general manager Jerry Caldwell stated that \\"the safety of our fans and competitors continues to be a focal point for Bristol Motor Speedway\\" and that the circuit was \\"able to secure an additional 600 feet of SAFER barriers and will complete the build out of the front and backstretch outside walls before the Food City 500 race weekend\\". Name change On April 10, Bristol Motor Speedway announced that the Food City 500 would be renamed the Food City 500 In Support of Steve Byrnes and Stand Up to Cancer. This change was made to honor longtime NASCAR broadcaster Steve Byrnes who was battling head and neck cancer. \\"We stand with the NASCAR community in being Steve Byrnes Strong,\\" said President and CEO of Food City, Steve Smith. \\"By banding together, we can drive even more awareness and support for our friend Steve, his family and everyone who Stands Up to Cancer.\\" Byrnes died two days after the race. Entry list The entry list for the Food City 500 was released on Monday, April 13, 2015, at 11:21 a.m. Eastern time. Forty-five cars were entered for the race. The only new entry that was not entered for the previous week's race at Texas Motor Speedway was Ron Hornaday, Jr. in the No. 30 Chevrolet by The Motorsports Group. {  {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! !

The Team Penske duo of Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano crash out on lap 20. The race was scheduled to start at 1:13 p.m., but inclement weather delayed the start for over an hour. The track was eventually dried up enough to allow the race to commence at 2:31 p.m.. Matt Kenseth led the first five laps before losing the lead to Kevin Harvick on lap 6. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. made contact with the wall exiting turn 2. He saved the car and the race continued under green. The first caution of the race flew on lap 19 when Brad Keselowski and teammate Joey Logano hit the front stretch wall. Exiting turn 4, Keselowski's car got loose trying to pass Alex Kennedy, tapped the wall and turned down towards the apron. Logano was right behind him and was unable to avoid hitting his teammate. Keselowski put the crash down to the weather, saying that \\"it was a really light sprinkle, the track was barely dry\\" and \\"that the car just took off on me\\", while also stating that he was disappointed to make contact with teammate Logano after his car \\"moved crazy sideways\\". Logano stated that the crash \\"happened quick, obviously\\" and that \\"you get early in this race and kind of want to settle in and just starting to get the top worked in a little bit there and Brad just got loose underneath that lapped car\\". To add insult to injury for the Penske duo, the rain returned just moments later that red-flagged the race on lap 22. =Driver change= Erik Jones made his unofficial Sprint Cup Series debut in substitution for Denny Hamlin. Prior to the restart, Erik Jones made his unofficial debut in the Sprint Cup Series when he replaced Denny Hamlin – who had suffered a muscle spasm – in the No. 11 car. During the race telecast, Hamlin stated that the injury had occurred during the race; he had \\"just pulled something in my neck to upper back about lap 12\\" and that he had \\"stretched it out and we've been working on it the last few hours\\". By stepping out the car, Hamlin also explained that \\"it's just better to have Erik come here and run some laps, get used to these Cup cars. We know where he is going to be in a few years\\". Jones, who had competed in the Xfinity Series race the previous day, had already flown back to Charlotte, North Carolina when he received a text message from an unnamed crew member of the No. 11 car to be prepared to fly back down to Bristol. \\"I got a text from one of the crew members and they let me know that I might need to be on standby,\\" Jones said. \\"Right then I started packing a bag. I called my dad and said, 'Hey, I think I might be getting to run a Cup race tonight.' He was like, 'Okay, cool keep me updated.' Took off right from there and flew here and helicoptered in and got in and drove.\\" He arrived by helicopter at the track just five minutes before the race restarted. Jones piloted the car to a 26th-place finish, which was credited to Hamlin as he had started the race. Restart Kevin Harvick leads the field to the restart. While the race was still under its first caution, the scoring pylon and digital leaderboards all changed the positions to 24 on the 24th lap in honor of Jeff Gordon. The race restarted shortly after 7:00 p.m. on lap 35 with Kevin Harvick in the lead. The race proceeded orderly until the second caution of the race flew on lap 61 – a scheduled competition caution because of the rain. Kurt Busch took the lead from his teammate Harvick, when Harvick pitted on the backstretch. Greg Biffle opted not to pit and assumed the lead, while Brett Moffitt and David Ragan had to start from the rear of the field, after both were caught speeding on pit road. Green flag run Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made an unscheduled stop on lap 103. The race restarted on lap 69. While Greg Biffle got a jump on the restart – on old tires – Kurt Busch on four new tires took the lead on lap 70 and would hold the lead for the next 55 laps. Kevin Harvick was tapped exiting turn 2 by Michael McDowell and made light contact with the wall, causing cosmetic damage. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made an unscheduled stop on lap 103 for a flat tire. Landon Cassill brushed the wall and began to slow down on the backstretch and almost took out several cars on lap 108. Kevin Harvick took the lead on lap 126 and held it for the next portion of the race before Busch took back the lead on lap 162. Harvick regained the lead on lap 167, before the race's third caution period commenced the following lap due to weepers. With the drivers pitting on either side of the track, the lead swapped hands momentarily; however, Harvick held the lead for the restart on lap 176. Jeff Gordon made an unscheduled stop on lap 205 for a loose, deflating wheel; he lost two laps in the process. In a show of support for Steve Byrnes, the fans and crews all stood up on the 250th lap holding up signs reading \\"I Stand Up For Steve.\\" The Fox crew went silent for the next three laps to show their support for their ill cohort. Jeff Gordon, on much fresher tires, managed to pull up to and pass leader Harvick to earn back one of his laps. This allowed Carl Edwards to pass Harvick for the lead on lap 257. Edwards put him back down two laps before the caution flew for the fourth time on lap 266 for rain. Edwards and Busch swapped the lead on pit road, but Edwards exited pit road with the lead. David Gilliland and Ryan Newman both started at the rear of the field for the restart; they were caught speeding on pit road. The rain intensified and the race was red flagged for the second time on lap 273. Second-half Halfway The race restarted on lap 278. Trouble in turn 4. After a 16-minute delay, the race restarted on lap 278; no sooner had the race restarted before an incident in turn 4 brought out the fifth caution. Going into turn 3, Kurt Busch pushed up into Jimmie Johnson on his outside; Johnson made moderate contact with the wall, while Busch spun out in front of the oncoming field. Other than a few pushed in fenders and Alex Bowman spinning out behind Busch, there was no major damage. =Trouble in turn 1= Kevin Harvick's streak of top ten finishes came to an end on lap 310. The race restarted on lap 292. Martin Truex, Jr. cut down his left-front tire after making contact with Mike Bliss exiting turn 2. The sixth caution of the race flew on lap 310 for a multi-car wreck in turn 1. Jeb Burton got turned into the wall by Johnson. David Ragan crashed into the back of Johnson and then T-boned the side of Burton's car, while Johnson slid down the track. Kevin Harvick, who was running third in the race at the time, could not stop in time, got sideways and crashed into Ragan. Ragan described the incident as \\"when you race back there with the squirrels, you find a nut sometimes\\" but that was \\"just Bristol\\" and \\"one of those things you have in short track racing\\". Kurt Busch was penalized for an uncontrolled tire and restarted from the tail-end of the field. =Restart= The race restarted on lap 325. A piece of metal that had fallen off Danica Patrick's car in turn 1 brought out the seventh caution of the race on lap 344. Edwards swapped the lead with teammate Matt Kenseth on pit road, but Kyle Larson opted not to pit and assumed the lead. The race restarted on lap 350. The eighth caution of the race flew on lap 367 for a heavy crash involving Cassill. Trying to get around him on the front stretch, Larson moved up and clipped Cassill's car. He clipped J. J. Yeley, who in turn, crashed into the turn 1 wall. He got out of the car unaided. Fourth quarter Fog descended on Thunder Valley in the closing laps of the race. Josh Wise crashed out with 29 laps to go. The race restarted on lap 381. Matt Kenseth caught up to Kyle Larson and the two battled for the lead for a good ten laps before Larson began to pull away with 81 laps to go. He hit pit road with 64 laps to go and Kenseth took back the lead. Kurt Busch went to the bottom of Kenseth, and used Martin Truex. Jr. as a pick to take the lead with 56 laps to go. After being down two laps at one point during the race, Jeff Gordon muscled his way into third with 50 laps to go. The ninth caution of the race flew with 29 laps to go for a multi-car wreck in turn 4. In a classic Bristol accordion effect, it started when Jamie McMurray blew a right-front tire running next to the wall in turn 3. Josh Wise, who was running right behind him, rear-ended him and was in turn, rear- ended by Clint Bowyer. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. was slowing down to avoid the wreck ahead when he was hit in the rear by Erik Jones, before Michael Annett rear-ended Jones. Danica Patrick, who was also trying to avoid the wreck, got hit in the rear and turned by Michael McDowell. Bowyer sprained his wrist trying to avoid hitting Wise again. Busch was the only driver to pit under the caution, and Kenseth assumed the lead. Matt Kenseth ended a 51 race winless streak. The race restarted with 19 laps to go, but the 10th caution of the race flew the following lap for a multi-car wreck on the backstretch. Tony Stewart clipped Kasey Kahne who turned down into A. J. Allmendinger. Both drivers hit the inside wall before turning back onto the racing surface taking out Casey Mears and Truex, Jr. in the process. The race restarted with eight laps to go, before the 11th caution of the race flew with six laps to go for another multi-car wreck on the backstretch. In another classic Bristol accordion effect, Edwards got loose exiting turn 2 and made contact with the wall. Kurt Busch had no time to react and crashed into him. Justin Allgaier clipped and turned with Paul Menard trying to avoid Edwards' car. Sam Hornish, Jr. got turned by Matt DiBenedetto while trying to avoid the wreck. After several laps under yellow – taking the race beyond its scheduled 500-lap distance – the race was red flagged for the third time on lap 505 as rain returned to the track again. The top three cars were borderline on fuel with the fuel window being 130 laps and their last stop being over 20 laps more than the window. The cars were brought down pit road after the race was suspended. After an additional 20-minute delay, the field began rolling off pit road. After three laps, the race restarted and pole-sitter Matt Kenseth took the victory on a green–white–checker finish, his first victory in 51 races going back to 2013. Post-race Driver comments In Victory Lane, Kenseth was pleased at ending his 18-month streak, stating that he was \\"glad we were able to finish this tonight and we had the car to stay ahead at the end\\", while also stating that \\"it was a crazy night for sure but it feels good to be back here in Victory Lane\\".

The writer dissociates from political affiliations of late. ==Controversy== N Prabhakaran's short story \\"Kaliyezhuthu\\" which was published in Mathrubhumi weekly in December 2017 invited vehement criticism from a section of school teachers in Kerala as the story was critical of the new pedagogy and the teachers' training sessions implemented in the state. While a section of teachers and educationists argued that the story exposed the pitfalls in school education system, the others went on airing harsh comments on writer that raised many concerns on freedom of expression.

In 2000, she received a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in Washington County. At the university, she met her husband, Russell James Della Rosa (also born 1976) and a native of Tontitown in Washington County. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. To remain within northwestern Arkansas, Russell became employed as a software engineer in Fayetteville. Jana accepted an entry level sales analyst position in Fayetteville with Ozark Consulting and Marketing, a firm which assists small businesses in the sale of their goods to Walmart and Sam's Club. In 2002, she joined the Bentonville-based outlet for Church & Dwight, a firm based in Ewing, New Jersey. During her ten years there, she was placed in charge of the sale of all laundry products to Walmart. She left her position in 2012 to become a full-time homemaker. She and Russell have two sons, Reagan and Riley. Della Rosa lists her religious affiliation as Christian. ==Political life== Della Rosa defeated two intra-party opponents, Paul Gene Caldwell (born c. 1977) of Lowell and Mike Kirby Whitmore (born 1959), an accountant from Rogers, in the Republican primary held on May 20, 2014, for the District 90 nomination to the state House. Della Rosa received 1,195 votes; Caldwell, 817, and Whitmore, 274. The three-term incumbent Republican, Skip Carnine of Rogers, was term limited. Della Rosa was then unopposed In the November 4 general election in a heavily Republican year statewide. Representative Della Rosa holds these committee assignments: (1) Public Transportation Committee, the committee for City, County, and Local Affairs and Joint Performance Review. In February 2015, Della Rosa joined dozens of her fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. That same month Della Rosa supported House Bill 1228, sponsored by Republican Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson. Della Rosa is a member of the board of directors of the conservative political action committee Conservative Arkansas. Her mother, Patsy Ann Wootton (born c. 1949) of Springdale, is the executive director of Conservative Arkansas and one of the group's founding members. She is strongly pro-life and a defender of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. ==See alsoReferences== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Springdale High School alumni Category:University of Arkansas alumni Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Arkansas Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:People from Springdale, Arkansas Category:People from Rogers, Arkansas Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Jana Della Rosa"},{"id":"46400120","text":"The Jusuf Efendi Mosque (; ) was built in 1773 at a time when North Macedonia was a part of the Ottoman Empire.

After graduating from Yale University in 1790, he entered as a law student the office of the late Governor of Massachusetts Caleb Strong. On admission to the bar he practised law for a year and a half in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and then settled for life in his native town. Here he continued the active duties of his profession until 1810, when he was chosen register of deeds for Hampshire County, Massachusetts. In 1821 he was appointed clerk of the courts of the same county, which office he resigned in 1837. Several times he was sent by the town as representative to the Massachusetts General Court, and he filled moreover with great fidelity many offices of trust in \\"the region of his residence.\\" At the age of 67 he retired from public life.

First class is a travel class on some passenger airliners intended to be more luxurious than business class, premium economy, and economy class. Originally all planes offered only one class of service, with a second class appearing first in 1955, when TWA introduced two different types of service on its Super Constellations. On a passenger jetliner, first class usually refers to a limited number (rarely more than 20) of seats or cabins toward the front of the aircraft which have more space, comfort, service, and privacy. In general, first class is the highest class offered, although some airlines have branded their new products as above first class. Propeller airliners often had first class in the rear, away from the noise of the rotating propeller, while first class on jet aircraft is normally positioned near the front of the aircraft, normally in front of the business class section, or on the top deck for aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. ==History== Early passenger planes were necessarily very uncomfortable - a seat in an open cockpit. As airplane design improved, so did the passenger experience, and the airlines concentrated on making flying as comfortable and appealing as possible. Flying was very expensive, but its limited appeal was balanced by the limited capacity of the airlines and their planes. As airplanes became larger, and flights more frequent, airlines came to appreciate that if they offered lower fares, they'd get more people on their planes. The ability to offer lower fares, for flights within and to/from the US, was restricted by the then Civil Aeronautics Board, formed in 1938 and operative since 1940. Originally the CAB only allowed a single fare to be charged for a flight, but after they started to slowly allow different fares in 1952, the airlines first offered different fare levels but still in one cabin style, and then in 1955, TWA came up with the concept of different service standards for the different fares. This marked the start of two-class planes, with the better class generally called First Class and the not-so-good class originally, in the US, being termed Coach Class. ==Service== Overview Example seating breakdown of a Boeing 777 airliner First-class seats vary from large reclining seats with more legroom and width than other classes to suites with a fully reclining seat, workstation and TV surrounded by privacy dividers. International first-class seats usually have 147–239 cm (58–94 inches) of seat pitch and 48–89 cm (19–35 inches) of width while domestic flights may have 86–173 cm (34–68 inches) of pitch and 46–56 cm (18–22 inches) in width. In fact this means there is less discomfort for taller people. Some airlines have first-class seats which allow passengers to let one guest sit for a short while face-to-face with the occupant of the cabin. First-class passengers usually have at least one lavatory for their exclusive use, with more than one on larger planes. Business- and economy- class passengers are not normally permitted in the first-class cabin. Normally AVOD (audiovisual on demand) entertainment is offered, although sometimes normal films, television programs and interactive games are provided on medium-large seat-back or armrest-mounted flat panel monitors. Especially for long-haul and high-yielding routes on top airlines, a first-class seat may have facilities akin to a five-star hotel, such as a mini-bar. Since the 1990s, a trend developed in which many airlines eliminated first class sections in favour of an upgraded business class. Newer business class seating is increasing adding features previously exclusive to first class such as convertible lie-flat seats, narrowing the amenities gap to an extent that first class is redundant. Furthermore, with the late 2000s recession, airlines have removed or not installed first class seating in their aircraft, as first class seats are usually double the price of business class but can take up more than twice the room, leaving business class the most expensive seats on such planes. However some, such as Garuda Indonesia, have opted to reintroduce first class seating sections with new aircraft. Suites Etihad Airways' \\"The Residence\\" suite. Each of Etihad's ten Airbus A380s have a single \\"Residence\\" installed in addition to standard first class suites. With business class seating moving upmarket, some airlines are reintroducing or modelling their first-class sections as suites. Singapore Airlines now markets its highest class on its A380s as \\"suites\\", with the tagline \\"A class above first.\\" The 2 m (78 inches) bed is separate from the seat and folds out from the back wall, with several other components of the suite lowering to accommodate the mattress. Windows are built into the doors and blinds offer privacy. Suites located in the center can form a double bed after the privacy blinds between them are retracted into the ceiling. Other A380 operators like Emirates also have a suite-like first class with similar amenities but the bed and chair are integrated where a button is pushed to turn the seat into a bed in seconds and vice versa. Etihad Airways introduced a three-room suite called \\"The Residence\\" in December 2014 when it added the Airbus A380 to its fleet. The Residence includes its own bedroom with double bed, dining/living area and fully functional shower. Domestic First Class In North America Delta Airlines first class on Airbus A220 On most flights within or between the United States (including Alaska but not Hawaii), Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean – what is normally regarded as regional business class or premium economy in the rest of the world is branded as \\"domestic first class\\" by US airlines. The service is generally a step below long haul international business class. US territories in the Western Pacific (Guam and the CNMI) and sometimes Hawaii are considered international for service purposes and generally feature long haul business class. However, domestic first class does have two very different meanings on certain transcontinental routes between New York City and California. Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue operate a special service on flights between John F. Kennedy International Airport and San Francisco International Airport or Los Angeles International Airport known as \\"Delta Transcontinental Service,\\" \\"American flagship service\\", \\"United p.s.\\" (p.s. stands for premium service), and \\"Mint,\\" respectively, with Delta and United using specially configured Boeing 757-200s and American and JetBlue using Airbus A321s. In the cases of American and JetBlue, first class is actually a three-cabin first class which is different from two-cabin first class, both in comfort and price (such as lie flat seats in first class, for example). In these cases, domestic business class is generally slightly higher than a two-cabin domestic first class ticket. The three-cabin first class is more of a true first class rather than a rebranded business class. On JetBlue however, first class is only offered on transcontinental flights, consisting of mini suites or lie-flat seats. US discount carriers (such as Southwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines) do not have first class cabins, instead opting for an all economy layout, sometimes with a few select rows with extra legroom (such as bulkhead and emergency row seats) available for a fee (or, in the case of Southwest, on a first come, first served basis due to their boarding process). In Europe First class service was formerly available on intra-European flights on airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Swissair.FLIGHT International, 6 September 1980 First class seats were typically configured in a 4-abreast configuration, similar to current North American domestic first class seats, rather than the 6-abreast configuration used for economy and latterly business class services.Woodley, Charles. The History of British European Airways. Casemate Publishers, p. 72. During the 1980s European first class was largely phased out in favour of 6-abreast seating throughout the aircraft, with variable numbers of seats allocated to business class (the business class cabin often being marked with a moveable divider). This allowed greater flexibility for the airlines, allowing them to allocate differing amounts of premium seating depending on the route. Turkish Airlines are one of the few European airlines still offering 4-abreast seating in their premium intra- Europe cabins, but they're sold as business class seats rather than first class.Turkish Airlines A321 seat plan from SeatGuru Same situation is in Russia onboard Aeroflot – Russian Airlines intra-Europe flights. ==Additional benefits== Lufthansa's First Class Terminal at Frankfurt Airport On the ground, first-class passengers usually have special check-in and security zones at the airport. Some airlines operate private first-class terminals and/or offer international first class passengers complimentary limousine rides to the airport. While it is typical that these passengers have lounge access, some airlines have separate lounges for first and business where the former may have more luxurious amenities. These passengers can often board the aircraft before other passengers, sometimes through their own jetbridge. Meal in a first class airport lounge in JFK Airport, prior to departure Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and gourmet meals are usually served with a choice of wine, dessert, and aperitifs. Often these meals have been designed by leading chefs and are served on white linen table cloths and with real cutlery. ==Pricing== Historically, first-class air travel has been very expensive. First-class long-haul fares regularly exceed $10,000 per person round trip, as opposed to $4,000–5,000 international business class tickets and $300–2,000 economy class tickets. With the emergence of frequent- flyer programmes, however, passengers have been able to upgrade their business- or economy-class tickets through membership in elite frequent-flyer programs and through the policies of some airlines that allow business and economy-class passengers to purchase last-minute upgrades on a space-available basis. Some airlines also offer upgrading to first class as a bonus to their employees. ==Operators== This is list of airlines with First Class for international flights only.

The First Class seats were either available as fully closed suites (First Suite on Airbus A380 and select Boeing 777-200ER) or as open suite style flat-bed sleeper seats (Old First Class on Boeing 747-400). Between 2016 and 2018, First Class was eliminated from the Boeing 777-200ER fleet in favor of more Business Class and Economy Class seats. In April 2019, the Kumho Asiana Group began to enter a financial crisis and announced the sale of Asiana Airlines. Due to the financial crisis, Asiana announced that First Class would be eliminated from all remaining aircraft with First Class by the end of September 2019 in order to save the airline from collapsing and in favor of newer Business Class seats and Premium Economy. All Asiana Airlines planes with First Class will be retired or will be retrofitted with newer Business Class and Premium Economy cabins. *China Airlines – Dedicated First Class was previously available on Boeing 747-400, with the introduction of Premium Economy and Premium Business Class on its Boeing 777-300ER. \\"Premium Business Class\\" is now the highest class of service. *Jet Airways – First Class (aboard all Boeing 777-300ER aircraft) *Malaysia Airlines – First Class (rebrand as Business Suite) *LAN Airlines – Dedicated first class cabin comprising a single row of five seats offered on Boeing 767 and Airbus 340 aircraft until late 2009. *Philippine Airlines – Dedicated first class or the \\"Maharlika Class\\" cabins was withdrawn in mid- 2000s. During the second half of 2006, PAL announced a cabin reconfiguration project for its Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A340-300 aircraft. The airline spent US$85.7 million to remove all first class seats and increase the size of its business and economy seats, leading to the aforementioned new seats; as well as add personal screens with audio and video on-demand (AVOD) across both cabin classes. *South African Airways – Dedicated first class cabin was withdrawn in 2001, but First Class could still be seen on the Boeing 747-400 aircraft until they were retired in 2007 and 2010. Until 1997, First Class was known as \\"Blue Diamond Class\\". *TAM Brasil - Dedicated first class was available on 777-300ER aircraft until 2014 *Transaero – Imperial Class (aboard some 737 and some Boeing 747 and all 777 aircraft). *Turkish Airlines – First Class suites were previously available on long haul 777 aircraft.

First Class was named \\"Global First\\" (later \\"Polaris First\\"). The first class began to be phased out in 2017 as United retired all their 747-400s. United discontinued all first class services by March 2018, although the first class seats remained on select Boeing 767-300ER and select 777-200ER aircraft with them being sold as Polaris Business until they are refurbished with the same Polaris Business class seats featured on the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. *US Airways – International First Class consisted of six flatbed suites in the first row on the Airbus A330-300.

It primarily uses songs from the 1960s written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman such as A Teenager in Love, Sweets For My Sweet, Little Sister, Viva Las Vegas, Can't Get Used to Losing You and the title song Save The Last Dance For Me. It opened at the Churchill Theatre Bromley on 9 January 2012 before embarking on a nationwide tour. A spin-off production from Dreamboats and Petticoats, it reunited the writing team with producer Bill Kenwright and director Keith Strachan. The choreography was by Olivier Award winner, Bill Deamer. As was the case in Dreamboats and Petticoats, all of the music was played live by the actors on stage. A new production has been announced, due to open April 2016 at Windsor Theatre Royal, before touring the UK again. ==Plot== In 1963, teen sisters Jennifer and Marie go on holiday to a caravan in Lowestoft without their parents. There they meet handsome American airman Milton who is stationed at a local airbase and invites the sisters to a dance at the base. At the dance youngest sister Marie meets and eventually falls in love with Curtis, a black airman from Tennessee. The story deals with themes of racial tension both in the American military and British society, as well as Anglo-American relations in the 1960s. ==Music== The musical was advertised as featuring the hits of Doc Pomus & Mort Shuman and included many of their songs, although some songs were included that the duo did not write together and some songs, like Way Down Yonder in New Orleans, that were not written by either of them. A double CD compilation album was released in May 2012. ==Cast== {  - ! Role !! Current Cast (2016) !! Original Cast (2012) !! 2013 Cast !!

It was often deemed inferior in comparison to Dreamboats and Petticoats. Catherine Jones of the Liverpool Echo described the plot as \\"purely a vehicle to introduce the American songwriters’ extensive back catalogue\\", while Phil Williams of the North Wales Pioneer called the show \\"unmissable\\", \\"sheer quality\\" with \\"excellent musicians\\".REVIEW: Save the Last Dance at Venue Cymru - North Wales Pioneer Bruce Blacklaw of The Scotsman was particularly scathing, and referred to the use of \\"cack-handed race and gender politics\\", with \\"all the depth of a burst paddling pool\\", although he conceded that the show was about the music and that the audience were dancing in the aisles. ==References *Official website Category:Fiction set in 1963 Category:2012 musicals Category:Jukebox musicals Category:British musicals ","title":"Save The Last Dance For Me (musical)"},{"id":"46400241","text":"Medjed is a minor Ancient Egyptian deity.

It was a sports talk radio industry term, referring to the tactic of hosts picking \\"a topic from the sports zeitgeist, often one that has no business being discussed because the answer is unknowable\\", making \\"loud, fact-free declarations\\" about the topic, eliciting angry listeners to call in and providing show content. The term gained popularity in sports journalism in 2012 to describe the coverage of National Football League quarterback Tim Tebow, and was analyzed in a Pacific Standard article by Tomás Ríos. It became increasingly used in other forms of journalism in 2014 after a piece on The Awl by John Herrman to describe the economic pressure on online publishers to produce instant, often glib, responses to current events. In April 2015, Buzzfeed editor Ben Smith wrote on Twitter, \\"We are trying not to do hot takes\\", to explain the deletion of two articles that were critical of the site's advertisers. Readers responded by pointing out that the deleted articles were not hot takes. Jezebels Jia Tolentino argued that the articles were instead \\"actually in service of an idea\\" and that based on Herrman's definition of hot take, ideas were positive alternatives to hot takes. ==References External links == * Category:American English idioms Category:Internet slang Category:Journalism terminology Category:Pejoratives Category:Sports mass media in the United States ","title":"Hot take"},{"id":"46400293","text":"Reptilisocia solomonensis is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Howard. He was featured in twenty-six humorous Western short stories, most of which originally appeared in the pages of Action Stories between 1934 and 1937, as well as the novel A Gent from Bear Creek. ==Character description== \\"Breck\\" Elkins is a hillbilly from Bear Creek, a fictional location in the Humboldt Mountains of Nevada. He is \\"mighty of stature and small of brain\\"—a physically huge and imposing figure, and his reputation as a short-tempered and ferocious fighter often precedes him throughout the Southwest. He is usually found in the company of Cap'n Kidd, his equally fierce and cantankerous horse. He sometimes wears a coonskin cap and is depicted wearing one in several illustrations that accompanied the stories in the original pulp magazine. Elkins is a man of limited intelligence and education, illiterate in some of the stories, while able to read in others. Although Howard referred to the Elkins stories as \\"Westerns,\\" they all have exaggerated elements and humor that make them closer in tone to Texas \\"Tall Lying\\" stories (such as the well- known tall tales of Pecos Bill) than to traditional Western action stories. Breckinridge is a larger-than-life figure whose abilities to dish out and absorb punishment go well beyond the limits of credulity. He is the first- person narrator (in hillbilly dialect) of all of his stories, and much of the humor is derived from his limited understanding of situations, leading to confusion and complications. His ill-fated attempts to help friends and relatives usually come to grief for himself and often those he was ostensibly aiding. His repeated romantic failures in wooing the eligible women he encounters are another recurring theme in the stories. ==History and reception== Howard wrote twenty-six Breckinridge Elkins stories in all, starting with \\"Mountain Man,\\" which was completed by July 1933. While he is better remembered for creating characters such as Conan and Solomon Kane, the Breckinridge Elkins stories were in fact the longest-running and most commercially successful series of Howard's writing career, running in every issue of Action Stories from \\"Mountain Man\\" in March–April 1934 through \\"The Conquerin' Hero of the Humbolts\\" in October 1936 after his death. Despite being overlooked by comparison with his contributions to the swords-and- sorcery genre, some critics have thought that in the Breckinridge Elkins stories \\"Finally, Robert's real storytelling voice, unfiltered through books and imagined histories, could be heard, and in the medium in which he was most familiar.\\" Based upon the success of the Breckinridge Elkins tales, during the summer of 1935 Howard edited together several of the previously published short stories along with some new material to form the chapters of an episodic novel, A Gent from Bear Creek. The common (and newly added) thread that held the chapters together was Breck's rocky romance with a young woman named Glory McGraw. Her ultimate consent to marry him marks one of the few unequivocally happy endings in Howard's writings. Although he had come close several times before, Howard had yet to have a full-length book published. Howard's agent, Robert Kline, was once again unsuccessful in finding an American publisher for A Gent from Bear Creek. It was eventually published in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins in 1937, the year after Howard committed suicide, and copies of that rare first edition have sold for upwards of $8000. ==In other media== Breckinridge Elkins is the subject of a webcomic adaptation by Gary Chaloner. ==See also== *List of Breckinridge Elkins stories *A Gent from Bear Creek *Mayhem on Bear Creek *The Pride of Bear Creek *Gary Chaloner ==References * Tales of Breckinridge Elkins at Project Gutenberg Australia Category:Western (genre) characters ","title":"Breckinridge Elkins"},{"id":"46400406","text":"Reptilisocia paryphaea is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Oxford University Press, 2008. == Biography == Born in Lincolnshire and raised in Coventry, Scaife attended the King Henry VIII grammar school on a scholarship, and obtained his MA in biology at Liverpool University, and his PhD in psychology at Oxford University. Scaife started his academic career as research assistant at the ethology group of the University of Oxford, where he cooperated with Mike Cullen, Nikolaas Tinbergen and Richard Dawkins. Later in the 1970s at University of Oxford he participated in the education and cognition research group of Jerome Bruner, with whom he published the article \\"The capacity for joint visual attention in the infant\\" in Nature in 1975. According to Bruner and Clark their cooperation helped \\"revolutionise the study of the infant mind. The target was to unravel what was involved in a child's learning to master a culture and the technology it generates. Mike knew that this problem was all about interactions. He saw that spectators could never get to the gist of things. It was through interacting that you learned how to do things - and also what needed doing.\\" Later in the 1980s he moved to the University of Sussex, where he became senior lecturer in 1999, and reader in 2001. In 1987 at Sussex University he had co-founded the school of cognitive and computing sciences. Also with his partner Yvonne Rogers he founded the Interact Lab to study representation in problem solving. == Selected publications == * Butterworth, George, Julie Rutkowska, and Michael Scaife.

He was possibly the son or otherwise a relative of David Arianites, a celebrated general under Basil II (r. 976–1025). He is first recorded in 1047, when the Pechenegs crossed the Danube and invaded Byzantine territory. At the time, according to John Skylitzes, he held the rank of magistros and the post of doux of Adrianople. In response to the Pecheneg attack, he was ordered to join with the officer commanding in Bulgaria, Basil Monachos, and the generals Michael and Kegenes (a baptised Pecheneg who had entered Byzantine service). The Byzantines managed to defeat and capture the Pechenegs, but instead of exterminating them, they were settled as colonists in the desolate plains of Moesia. When the Pechenegs rebelled a few years later, Arianites was a senior officer in the army sent under the hetaireiarches Constantine to oppose them. Due to an ill-advised attack by a part of the Byzantine army, which left their fortified encampment to charge the Pechenegs on open field, the Byzantines suffered a heavy defeat at Basilike Libas near Adrianople: Arianites received a heavy wound by a javelin in the intestines and died two days after the battle, while another senior commander, Michael Dokeianos, was captured and killed by the Pechenegs. According to Rodolphe Guilland, he probably held the post of Domestic of the Schools of the West at that time. == References  Sources == * * * Category:1050 deaths Category:11th-century Byzantine people Constantine Category:Byzantine generals Category:Byzantine governors Category:Deaths by javelin Category:Domestics of the Schools Category:Magistroi ","title":"Constantine Arianites"},{"id":"46400520","text":"Pakkala () is a city district in Vantaa, Finland. It is the most populated district in the Aviapolis major region, and is named after the Backas estate situated there. Pakkala is notable for the suburb of Kartanonkoski and the business park of Vantaanportti, which includes both Jumbo Shopping Centre and the Flamingo entertainment center. ==Housing== Kartanonkoski suburb In 2014, Pakkala had a population of 9,509, which had grown from a mere 416 in 1990. The reason for rapid growth was the construction of suburbs in the area, particularly that of Kartanonkoski. Although officially a part of Pakkala, the suburb and its surrounding area is often referred to as simply \\"Kartanonkoski\\" for marketing purposes. Kartanonkoski came about as a result of a 1998 competition organized by the City of Vantaa for the planning of a \\"garden village\\". The winner was the Swedish architectural firm Djurgårdsstadens arkitekter, who derived the concept from the Garden city movement in Britain at the end of the 19th century, as well as the New Urbanism movement at the time of its inception. The suburb consists of brightly colored houses and apartment blocks arranged primarily in terraces, with emphasis on local parks and landscape architecture.City of Vantaa: Kartanonkoski toi Ruusut kaupunkisuunnittelulle (in Finnish) 2.3.2010 With its total land area of , Pakkala has an overall population density of about . ==Business== Entertainment centre Flamingo, with Jumbo Shopping Centre in the background Pakkala encapsulates the business park of Vantaanportti, which mostly hosts operations for constituents of the Finnish food industry such as HKScan, Finn- Catering, and Vaasan & Vaasan.

The gemelli muscles belong to the lateral rotator group of six muscles of the hip that rotate the femur in the hip joint. ==Superior gemellus muscle== Gemelli muscles – superior shown in red above internal obturator, and inferior shown below the internal obturator. The gemelli muscles are two small muscular fasciculi, accessories to the tendon of the internal obturator muscle which is received into a groove between them. The superior gemellus muscle is the higher placed gemellus muscle that arises from the outer (gluteal) surface of the ischial spine, and blends with the upper part of the tendon of the internal obturator. It is smaller than the inferior gemellus. In some people, the fibres of the gemellus superior extend further than average, and are prolonged onto the medial surface of the greater trochanter of the femur. The superior and inferior gemelli are supplied by the inferior gluteal artery. Nerve supply to the superior gemellus is from the supply to the internal obturator – L5, S1, and S2. ==Inferior gemellus muscle== The inferior gemellus muscle arises from the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, immediately below the groove for the internal obturator tendon. It blends with the lower part of the tendon, and is inserted with it into the medial surface of the greater trochanter. It is rarely absent. Like the internal obturator muscle, the gemellus superior and gemellus inferior help to steady the femoral head in the acetabulum. Both muscles also help to laterally rotate the extended thigh and abduct the flexed thigh at the hip by assisting the internal obturator. The gemelli muscles act to compensate the reduced power of the internal obturator as it turns around the lesser sciatic notch. Blood supply is from the inferior gluteal artery. Nerve supply is from the supply to the quadratus femoris – L4 to S1. Etymology: Gemellus is the diminutive of \\"geminus\\" meaning twin, doubled or duplicated. The superior and inferior gemellus muscles are paired and perform the same action. == Additional images == File:Superior gemellus.jpgSuperior gemellus muscle. File:Gray235.pngRight hip bone.

It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. ==Location== The building stands on western side of Gdańska Street at N°119, between Chocimskiego street and Artyleryjski street. ==History== The building was built between 1895 and 1896 for Emilia and Fritz Heroldt, a couple of rentiers. At the time, the address was Danzigerstrasse 67, Bromberg. They lived there until 1899. Fritz Heroldt had also a tenement built in 1896 in Dworcowa Street N°71 by Fritz Weidner. At the beginning of the 20th century Antoni Chołoniewski (1872-1924) lived in the villa. He was a journalist and Polish national activist who wrote the Spirit of Polish History (). As a remembrance, a plaque has been placed on the facade. During PRL times, the villa housed the Civic Militia Command (). Later a school for girls has been established there, then a language school. Since April 2017, an internet company, Agnat, has moved its headquarters into the premises. Prior to the installation, the firm led an external and internal complete renovation of the villa, based on heritage agency recommendations. ==Architecture== It is one of the first realization of Berliner architect Fritz Weidner, a few years after his arrival in Bydgoszcz. The elevation is decorated with characteristic Neo- Baroque ornaments: * puttoes figures; * garlands and friezes; * volutes; * caryatids. The thorough restoration funded by the company Agnat spanned from 2014 to April 2017. Renovations were conducted under the close supervision of the urban conservator of monuments. The coloring of the facade is similar to the original, all decorations: garlands, scrolls, statues of plump angels have been meticulously renewed. Interiors are likewise, with wooden windows, reconstructed door frames, wooden columns, roof truss, curving staircase with handmade wooden balustrade scenic. The building has been put on the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List (N°601324, Reg. A/1097/1-2) on April 15, 1994. ==Gallery== File:Dom (z oficyną), 1895-1896 Bydgoszcz, ul.

Hellman (born March 1, 1963) is the dean and distinguished professor in the practice of development at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.http://www.georgetown.edu/news/joel-hellman- appointed-sfs-dean.html He was appointed in July 2015 and led the school, the oldest school of international affairs in the United States, during the celebration of its centennial anniversary in 2019. Formerly, he was chief institutional economist at the World Bank. ==Career== Hellman began his academic career as an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University and a Fellow at the Harriman Institute for Russian and East European Studies. From 1993 to 1997, he was an assistant professor in the Department of Government at Harvard University and a Fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and East European Studies. In 1997, Hellman joined the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in London, where he served as senior political councillor. At the EBRD, he was editor of the annual Transition Report, which surveyed progress in the transition to market economics and democratic politics in the countries of the former Soviet Union. He led the development of the annual Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), a multi-country survey of firm behavior in the post-Soviet states that became an important data source for comparing how firms developed in the context of different transition economies. In 2000, Hellman moved to the World Bank, serving in a variety of roles across multiple countries and regions. He led World Bank operations on governance and anti-corruption in the Europe and Central Asia Region. He served as Governance Adviser in Indonesia and led the World Bank’s response to the East Asian tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia. He managed the World Bank’s governance operations in the South Asia region, covering such countries as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In 2013, he was appointed to lead the World Bank’s global work in Fragile and Conflict Affected Countries based in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2015, he was appointed as the World Bank’s first Chief Institutional Economist, leading the World Bank’s research and analytical work on governance and institutions. In July 2015, he was selected as Dean in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University as well as Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Development. He introduced the first joint undergraduate degree at Georgetown University in Business and Global Affairs together with the McDonough School of Business. He launched the Center on Security and Emerging Technology to provide policy-oriented research analysis on how new technologies are reshaping the global security landscape. == Research == Hellman’s research focused on the politics of the transition to a market economy in the former Soviet States. He is best known for developing the concept of “partial reform equilibrium” that explained how the early actors who gained enormous wealth by exploiting the market distortions of the early post-Soviet transition from a state-owned economy used their economic and political clout to preserve those distortions and thus stall further progress of market reforms. This laid the foundation for an understanding of the rise of oligarchs whose wealth and power were derived from partial reforms in the path to a market economy. The concept of a partial reform equilibrium has subsequently been applied to other countries in the process of market transition, such as China. Together with Daniel Kaufmann at the World Bank, Hellman developed the concept of “state capture”, which is defined as form of political corruption in which actors seek to influence the shape of the state’s laws, rules and regulations in their interests through the provision of private benefits to public officials. Hellman and Kaufmann developed comparative measures of state capture across multiple countries. The concept of state capture has been applied to many countries in the world, most dramatically in South Africa, where a specially created State Capture Commission was created to investigate forms of corrupt political influence. == Education == Hellman holds a B.A. in area studies from Williams College, and a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University as well as an MPhil in Russian and East European studies from the University of Oxford, St. Antony's College. == Personal life == Hellman was born in Brooklyn, New York. He is married and has one child. == Publications == * \\"Seize the State, Seize the Day: An Empirical Analysis of State Capture and Corruption in Transition Economies,\\" (with Geraint Jones and Daniel Kaufmann), Journal of Comparative Economics, vol. 31, no. 4 (December 2003). * \\"Confronting the Challenge of State Capture in Transition Economies,\\" (with Daniel Kaufmann) Finance and Development, vol. 38, no. 3 (September 2001). * \\"Review Essay: Institutional Design in Post-communist Societies,\\" East European Constitutional Review, vol. 7, no. 3 (Summer 1998). * \\"Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Post-Communist Transitions,\\" World Politics, vol. 50, no. 2 (January 1998).

A prequel to the 1995 video game of the same name, it was successfully funded via the crowdfunding website Kickstarter on April 10, 2015, and released on Steam as an Early Access title on October 22, 2015. Then Descent was removed from Steam and GOG.com Early Access on September 29, 2017, by Descendent Studios. As of October 2018, Descendent Studios signed a deal with Little Orbit for financial support. The game is expected to be available on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.https://gematsu.com/2018/10/descent-reboot-coming- to-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch ==Premise== By the year 2136, the planet Earth has become unsustainable due to the depletion of natural resources, threatening the stability of human society and civilization. Space explorers have been sent across the galaxy to find a new home planet for humanity to evacuate to. After word got out that none of them have returned, people discovered that mankind's only hope for continued survival is to harvest asteroids, leading to starfighter skirmishes over possession of the most profitable and life- sustaining ones. ==Development== In November 2014, several former developers for the game Star Citizen, led by Eric \\"Wingman\\" Peterson, announced that they were forming Descendent Studios to work on a game similar to Descent in play style, with the working title Ships That Fight Underground. The company was approached by an Interplay shareholder in December who set up a meeting with the CEO of Interplay and Descendent Studios. A deal was then struck to license the Descent name to Descendent Studios. In March 2015, Descendent Studios announced a Kickstarter campaign for Descent: Underground, a new prequel using Interplay's existing trademark rights to the Descent franchise which include the name \\"Descent\\" and a few sound effects and MIDI tracks (with Parallax Software owning all remaining properties, such as the original \\"Pyro GX\\" ship, some sound and music clips and copyrights to the descent universe which includes weapons, story and all level assets). It is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and was initially scheduled to release in March 2016. The game's production was proceeded after a successful Kickstarter resulted in $601,773 by 8,164 investors. In August 2015, Descendent Studios allowed live play of an early Pre-Alpha build of the Descent Underground game and engine at the Rooster Teeth Expo (RTX) in San Antonio Texas. The game demoed was an RTX crowd favorite, with attendees waiting in line up to an hour for an opportunity to play. The game was also demonstrated to function with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. In October 2015, Descendent Studios released their first playable online multiplayer build to select members with Proving Grounds access (this includes \\"Underground\\" subscribers). The game features several modes, single player vs bots, co-op vs bots, survival vs bots, multiplayer deathmatch, multiplayer CTF with miners, and conquest game-modes. On October 22, 2015, Descendent Studios released the game on Steam Early Access. A single player campaign is in development, and is expected to be released when they leave early access. On September 29, 2017, Descendent Studios announced they would be removing the game from Steam Early Access, and signing a distribution deal with Little Orbit which will allow them to do a larger single player campaign as well as improve the game from top to bottom and to launch on both the Xbox One as well as the PlayStation 4 in 2019. Little Orbit has signed on to help market and distribute the Descent brand starting with this first chapter of the reboot of the Descent franchise. In early May 2019, Descendent Studios' homepage was taken offline and multiplayer servers for game builds stopped responding. Unofficial posts by a developer from Descendent Studios indicated that all development on the game had been completely halted, this being due to financial and legal issues that developed between Descendent Studios and the publisher Little Orbit. The original posts were deleted, but YouTuber Montoya documented the posts and history of the development woes in a video uploaded to his channel. Little Orbit initiated legal action against Descendent Studios in January 2020, alleging the studio of breach of contract, negligent representation, fraud, and libel. Little Orbit asserts that the studio had lied about the state of the Descent license from Interplay when it entered the publishing deal in September 2017, having come to believe since that Interplay has revoked the license from Descendent, and sought at least in damages from the studio. The following month, the developers reiterated that the game is not cancelled and expressed hope of eventually releasing the game at an undetermined future date. ==References *Descendent Studio's website *Official website Category:Cooperative video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Descent (series) Category:Early access video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Interplay Entertainment games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Linux games Category:Video games about robots Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online battle arena games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Upcoming video games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the 22nd century Category:Video games set on the Moon Category:Video games with 6 degrees of freedom Category:Video games with variable translation control Category:Windows games Category:Zero-G shooters ","title":"Descent (upcoming video game)"},{"id":"46400897","text":"Agios Mamas ( ) is a village in the Chalkidiki peninsula in northern Greece.

It features the main character, Not Sidney Poitier, and his misadventures in early adulthood. Each adventure mirrors a prominent Sidney Poitier film, like The Defiant Ones or Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and incorporates a significant twist. The novel reflects a Post-black writing style by parodying the traditions of Black literature. == Plot Summary == Chapter 1: The novel begins with the immaculate conception of Not Sidney Poitier, a boy whose mother, Portia, invests in Turner Broadcasting on the ground floor, and gains quite a lot of money when it becomes successful. Ted Turner comes to visit her, and meets Not Sidney. Portia dies soon after this meeting, and Ted becomes Not Sidney's guardian, giving him free rein over his money and life to avoid the white savior stereotype. Not Sidney grows up in his own home with attendants who work for him, and gets an education from a socialist college student named Betty. Not Sidney is also heavily bullied, and in order to combat this bullying he attempts to learn martial arts. When that fails, he learns how to “fesmerize” people, an ability that is kin to hypnosis, and uses that ability to mess with Ted, Betty, and Ted's wife Jane Fonda. Upon reaching high school age, Not Sidney decides to attend public school. He develops a crush on his teacher, which she notices. She invites him back to her home where she sexually assaults him on two separate occasions, threatening to fail him if he does not allow it. After the second time, she fails him anyway. Not Sidney attempts to report this, but is ridiculed by administration both at his individual school and at the Board of Education. Because of this, he drops out and decides to go on a journey to California. Chapter 2: Not Sidney attempts to drive cross- country to California, then is stopped, arrested because he is black, and thrown into prison unlawfully. While being transported to another facility, the bus crashes, and Not Sidney and the prisoner he's chained to, Patrice, escape. He and Patrice head back to Atlanta on foot. After a time, they get into a fight and are interrupted by a blind girl, Sis, and her brother Bobo. After being taken into their home, they all plan to jump atop the train headed back to Atlanta the next morning. While they all sleep, Not Sidney has the “Band of Angels” dream, in which he is a slave named Raz-ru and watches a high-yella woman be taken from her high-society life and be bought by his master, who Not Sidney eventually kills.The next day, Sis and Patrice begin a romantic relationship, and begin drinking to celebrate. That night, they and Bobo drink themselves to sleep. When the sun rises, Not Sidney opts to leave them sleeping and ride the train to Atlanta on his own. Movies: The Defiant Ones, A Patch of Blue, Band of Angels Chapter 3: Upon returning from his failed cross country trip, Not Sidney decides that he wants go to college, and sets up a meeting with Gladys Feet, who he essentially bribes with a donation to the school for a place in the upcoming class. He's placed in a room with Morris Chesney, a fraternity brother who attempts to bully and haze Not Sidney and others while they rush the fraternity. To end their ongoing conflict, Not Sidney fesmerizes him into reorienting the fraternity around recycling and leaving him alone. While at Morehouse, he attends classes taught by Percival Everett, goes to his office hours, and enters into a mentor/mentee relationship with him after Everett reveals that he is a fraud. While attending Everett's classes, Not Sidney meets Maggie, a Spelmanite, and they enter into a relationship. Chapter 4: Not Sidney goes home with Maggie from Morehouse for Thanksgiving, and finds out her family are a group of black conservatives who are bigoted against black people with darker skin, and that Maggie has brought him home primarily as a tool to upset her parents. While there, Not Sidney experiences a series of microaggressions and is hit on by Agnes, who sleeps with him to upset Maggie. During their sexual encounter, Not Sidney has the “No Way Out” dream, where he is a doctor who loses a white, near unsavable patient and is blamed for his death. Near the end of the visit, Maggie's parents find out about Not Sidney's vast sums of money, and begin to treat him with a near-reverent respect. After recognizing this, Not Sidney calls them out about their colorism and causes a scene at thanksgiving dinner, resulting in him leaving their house and ending things with Maggie. Movies: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, No Way Out Chapter 5: After dropping out of Morehouse, Not Sidney attempts to drive cross-country to California again, and this time his car begins to break down in the small Alabama town of Smuteye. He pulls into the driveway of a small house, for tools to use to fix the car. The nuns living there offer their tools, but ask him to fix their leaking roof in exchange. The sisters become convinced that Not Sidney has been sent by god to help them build their church and tell him he will be building a fence the following day. He goes to sleep, and has the “Uncle Buck and the Preacher” dream, in which he is Buck, the leader of a wagon train of newly freed slaves in the west who are running from a posse of army men who want them to work their land. He steals a horse from a preacher in order to escape, but it backfires and the preacher punches Not Sidney in the face. Upon waking, the sisters tell him again about their conviction that he will build their church, but Not Sidney is not convinced. He uses their tools to fix his car and leaves. Upon stopping at the Smuteye diner to ease his hunger and hearing the waitress and patrons ridicule the sisters, he decides to help them build the church with his vast sums of money. He returns and after some struggles to obtain cash for his check, Not Sidney cashes the check in Montgomery with a clerk named Mr. Scrunchy. On his way back, he witnesses a Klan rally from the safety of his car, and watches the cross burn out before he leaves. Movies: Lilies of the Field, Uncle Buck and the Preacher Chapter 6: He returns to the sisters with the money, but finds they have hired a suspicious architect who clearly plans to abscond with the money. Because of his suspicions, Not Sidney only gives them a portion of the money, then goes to the diner only to be arrested for a murder he did not commit. He calls Ted Turner and Percival Everett for help, and they come down to rescue him. After being freed from prison, he finds that the person who was murdered looked exactly like him, and wonders if that was the real Sidney Poitier. A massive tornado starts to form as he returns to the nun's house, he sees Scrunchy and Sister Iranaeus shoveling his money into a bag. They run, and Not Sidney moves to apprehend them, but when Not Sidney finds them, they were both dead after the truck hit a pole. Not Sidney gets his money back, and decides to resume his trip to California by air. Movies: They Call Me Mr. Tibbs! Chapter 7: Not Sidney flies to San Francisco, where he is met with press and a limousine, and is whisked away to an award show. He has truly become Sidney Poitier, and wins an award for a performance of his. In his acceptance speech, he references the fact that they are strangers to him, and dedicates the award to his mom, whose grave he has left unmarked. The words that end the book, his speech, and will stand on his mother's grave are: I Am Not Myself Today. == Major Characters == The following characters are listed in order of appearance, with major characters in bold. Not Sidney Poitier, our main character Portia Poitier, Not Sidney's mother Ted Turner, head of Turner Broadcasting and Not Sidney's de facto guardian Betty, Not Sidney's socialist teacher and mentor Podgy Patel, Not Sidney's accountant Miss Hancock, Not Sidney's high school teacher who sexually assaults him Patrice, a racist convict who is chained to Not Sidney when the prison bus crashes Sis, a racist blind girl Not Sidney and Patrice run into Bobo, Sis’ little brother Mrs. Feet, an admissions officer from Morehouse who is attracted to Not Sidney and bribes him Percival Everett, a fraudulent Morehouse professor who takes a shine to Sidney and enters into a mentoring relationship with him Maggie Larkin, Not Sidney's first girlfriend Agnes Larkin, Maggie's sister The Larkins, Maggie's conservative parents Violet, their maid Sister Iranaeus, the lead nun at the house where Not Sidney's car breaks down Thornton Scrunchy, a scam artist who conspires to steal the funds for the church The Chief, the racist chief of police in Smuteye who arrests Not Sidney and Everett == Themes ==  Identity Crisis  I Am Not Sidney Poitier exhibits in many exaggerated moments the identity crisis associated with racial performances. In the novel, Not Sidney can never find his true self because Everett designed him to be a caricature of Sidney Poitier. He was constantly forced into a mold that eluded him; creating as Christian Schmidt states in his essay The Parody of Postblackness... “a mere negation of self,” because as he continues “without Sidney, Not Sidney would not exist.” Though Everett paints an abstract picture by creating a character that opposes its own DNA, he cleverly links Not Sidney to actual Sidney Poitier movies to highlight the expectations associated with performances. Michael Buening, an editor from PopMatters, attaches this idea to the confusion many black men feel during situations in which they can't escape the expectations that come with their skin. From this Buening concludes that Everett's parodied trope characterizes the experience of life for black men as a journey of immense searching.  Post-Blackness/Parody of Black Literature  In the novel, Everett engages with several aspects of traditional black literature through parody: “Playfully engaging the fiction of Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, and intertextually invoking his own literary oeuvre, Everett’s I Am Not Sidney Poitier signifies upon the history of African American literature and can fruitfully be read as a parody of it. Following Hutcheon, I use parody not in the narrow sense of “ridiculing imitation” (A Theory 5) but as a term to describe “complex forms of ‘trans-contextualization’ and inversion”. This approach is characteristic of many \\"Post-black\\" authors. These authors create worlds in which race may or may not be a player, but does not totally control or define the story. By doing so, these authors are bucking the expectations and constraints of \\"Black literature\\", and establishing that black authors are capable of creating stories that are not entirely about navigating the concept of race. == Critical Reception == I Am Not Sidney Poitier received a warm reception among its few reviewers and won two awards; the Believer Book Award and the Hurston/Wright Legacy award. Everett's supporters lauded his absurdist comedic approach in creating a character that “negates” everything he's intended to represent. An essay by assistant professor Christian Schmidt, from the University of Bayreuth defines the novel as a “meta parody that thematizes the very difference between original and copy even if the sign that marks this difference is as crude and banal as the simple “not” of its protagonists name.” This attribute of the novel along with its experimental and fractured lens of Not Sidney, create the “coded discourse” necessary for parody to thrive. Critics like Schmidt, recognized Everett's emphasis on parody and noted instances like his 2009 Fuck were discredited by many “intratextual critiques”. I Am Not Sidney Poitier has been classified as a part of \\"Post-black literature\\" where black novels parody/respond to the genre of Black literature. These authors write worlds that are entirely dependent on the text itself, and as such do not address the racism outside of it. NPR called the story a “delicious comedy of miscommunications” and “one of the funniest, most original stories to be published in years.\\" Publishers Weekly's review lauded Everett as “a novelist at the height of his narrative and satirical powers” and the novel as “smart and without a trace of pretentiousness”. Kirkus Reviews said about the book “The author had some fun; the reader will too.” ==References== Category:2009 American novels Category:Believer Book Award-winning books Category:Graywolf Press books ","title":"I Am Not Sidney Poitier"},{"id":"46401088","text":"St Wilfrid’s Church, Barrow upon Trent is a Grade I listed parish church in the Church of England in Barrow upon Trent, Derbyshire.The Buildings of England.

The icon was hidden due to concerns for its safety during a Turkish military action in 1803 by Ottoman forces based in Tripoli. According to tradition, when the monks went to retrieve the icon, a second traditional icon thought lost had miraculously appeared next to the one that was hidden. These \\"lost\\" or \\"hidden\\" icons are now \\"found,\\" and on display in the chapel. The Marian icons are in the glykophiloussa (\\"sweetly- kissing\\") style, which depict Mary kissing the baby Jesus. On feast days, they are carried in procession decorated with local oranges. The events in Tripoli were connected to the history of Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr of the Peloponnese, a Greek Orthodox Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in Arcadia, near Tripoli. He converted to Islam as a boy, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk. Demetrius decided that to expiate his sins, he must perform a great penance by returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity. Because of this, he was tried by a Turkish judge for apostasy from Islam and convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who tried to cover up for him. Thus, in addition to celebrating the icons of the Panagia, the church at the former monastery is also used for an annual commemoration of Demetrius. The monastery was founded in the 18th century as a Greek Orthodox nunnery, and became the site of a secret Greek school under the Ottoman occupation of Greece. During the Greek war of Independence, it was used as the first national mint of Greece to strike coinage for the Greek government. It became a male monastery in 1856, and the surrounding land became a glebe for the monks. From 1911-1976, under the administrations of Hieromonks Joseph and Makarios Drosos, the chapel was re-dedicated in honor of Saint John the Baptist, (called \\"The Forerunner\\" in Greek), because Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr had become a monk at a monastery dedicated to Saint John on the island of Chios before returning to Tripoli. While the monastery buildings are still intact, local monks now reside at other monasteries in the area and act as caretakers for the site. ==Links== * Portokalousa blog * News article with history Category:Christian monasteries in Greece Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries ","title":"Panagia Katakekrymeni-Portokalousa"},{"id":"46401100","text":"Copidognathus oculatus is a species of mite in the Halacaridae family.

It is thus able to convey both direct and indirect fire. To be able to serve as a howitzer, gun-howitzers are typically built to achieve up to 60–70° of elevation. For effective direct fire, the gun- howitzers typically employ a fairly long barrel, usually not shorter than 30 calibres. Its ammunition also has a high muzzle velocity and often large calibre (often 120 mm and larger). ==History== Historically the first gun- howitzer was the French canon obusier of 19th century. The smooth-bore Canon obusier de 12 was a versatile weapon that quickly replaced both ordinary cannons and howitzers in French service, and became one of the basic types of artillery used by both sides of the American Civil War. Owing to their versality, gun-howitzers gained prominence in the period leading to World War II as a more flexible weapon than ordinary howitzers and were adopted by armies of both the Allies (for instance the Soviet ML-20 152 mm M1937 and British (88 mm) Ordnance QF 25-pounder) and the Axis (German 10.5 cm leFH 18). Modern example of gun-howitzer is Gun-howitzer M84 NORA. The howitzer was widely used in the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War (of 1870), the First World War, and the Second World War, being used as cannons to support discretion. Over the years the Howitzer was modified and in most of its models only the shape of the gun changed, being the case that it would be used as a field support for the infantry, for sieges or for massive bombardment of strategic points. ==See also== *Gun-mortar == References ==  Citations   Bibliography  * * * Category:Cannon Category:Field artillery ","title":"Gun-howitzer"},{"id":"46401415","text":"San Rocco Redoubt () was a redoubt in Kalkara, Malta. It was built by Great Britain during the French blockade of 1798-1800. It was part of a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments encircling the French positions in Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour. The redoubt was built roughly halfway between Fort Ricasoli (then occupied by French forces) and Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower. It was located close to San Rocco Battery, a Maltese insurgent battery which had men from the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot in its garrison. The redoubt was built around a small building and a chapel dedicated to Saint Roch, from which it got its name. The redoubt was built by the British in order to provide cover for retreating British forces in the case of the arrival of a French relief force to break the siege of Malta. Upon the arrival of a relief force, the 30th and 89th Regiments of Foot were to gather at San Rocco Battery, and under the cover of San Rocco Redoubt, they were to retreat to Żabbar. From there, they would retreat to Żejtun, and then to Fort Rohan under the cover of San Lucian redoubt. They would embark on their ships in Marsaxlokk Harbour and evacuate the island.

City officials made the landlord turn off the boiler in the building because it was leaking carbon monoxide, the building had become a \\"shooting gallery\\" for heroin addicts. The neighborhood was in shambles and junkies were a constant threat. So, Schles’ landlord boarded the windows to prevent break-ins, this worked to Schles’ advantage, the boarded-up space provided Schles the perfect environment to create a dark room. From his created darkroom he developed the photos of his surroundings and the general life of 1980s New York City. *The Geometry of Innocence. Hatje Cantz, 2001.

It was released by Strike Force Entertainment / Cherry Red Records on 9 March 2015. ==Background== The Velvet Trail is Almond's first album of original material since Varieté in 2010. It was produced by Christopher Braide and features a duet with Beth Ditto of indie rock band Gossip on the track \\"When the Comet Comes\\". Almond had previously stated that he would no longer record albums of original material following Varieté. He subsequently recorded a number of albums outside of the pop genre which mostly featured songs written by others. During this time he was approached by Braide, known for his work with pop artists such as Lana Del Rey, David Guetta and Britney Spears, who urged Almond to make \\"the ultimate Marc Almond album\\" Braide was a longtime fan of Almond and had in fact worked with Almond before, unbeknownst at that point to the singer. Almond explained the situation to Simon Price of The Quietus, stating \\"it was only afterwards that I realised where I knew Chris Braide from: he'd sung backing vocals on the Soft Cell reunion album Cruelty Without Beauty, and I'd passed him in the corridor\\". Braide lured Almond back into songwriting by sending him three instrumental tracks, \\"hoping to change his mind about retirement\\", a plan that worked when \\"all three were met with resounding enthusiasm\\". They continued to work in this manner until the album was completed. The 'Velvet Trail' of the album title refers to a beach walk in Southport, Almond's home town. The walk is a local tourist spot and is part of the Wetlands Regional Park maintained by Lancashire County Council. The album was released in a standard one disc jewel case CD, a limited edition two disc digipak UK only version and a limited edition double vinyl version. The limited CD edition includes a DVD containing videos to four of the tracks on the album. The double vinyl version comes with a poster and has alternative takes of two of the songs as bonus tracks, including a solo version of \\"When the Comet Comes\\". The artwork for each version is slightly different; the standard CD features blue colouring, the limited double CD has red, different, colouring and the vinyl version is a negative image. The Velvet Trail was supported by a UK tour from 16 April to 1 May 2015. ==Critical reception== On the Metacritic website, which aggregates reviews from critics and assigns a normalised rating out of 100, the album received a score of 79. This is based on 11 reviews in total, 10 of which were positive and one which was mixed. Record Collector gave the album full marks in their review, stating \\"\\"Marc's distinctive vocals have rarely sounded richer and warmer\\" and that The Velvet Trail is \\"a release up there with Almond's best\\". The Guardian calls the album \\"straight-ahead pop, with big choruses and melodies\\" and comments that \\"Almond's voice....is still enthralling\\" The review in The Observer states that Almond's \\"first set of original material in five years is an impressive affair\\" and adds that \\"Almond is at his best on the compelling torch songs that have long been his stock in trade\\" The PopMatters review site states that \\"The Velvet Trail is a complete and coherent artistic statement\\" and that it is \\"only more special for its rarity\\" On MusicOMH they find it a \\"strong and often stirring album, and the voice sounds fantastic\\". ==Track listing== All tracks written by Chris Braide and Marc Almond # \\"Act One (Instrumental)\\" – 0:50 # \\"Bad to Me\\" – 4:22 # \\"Zipped Black Leather Jacket\\" – 3:57 # \\"Scar\\" – 3:42 # \\"Pleasure's Wherever You Are\\" – 4:27 # \\"Act Two (Instrumental)\\" – 0:48 # \\"Minotaur\\" – 4:29 # \\"Earthly\\" – 4:22 # \\"The Pain of Never\\" – 4:14 # \\"Demon Lover\\" – 3:25 # \\"Act Three (Instrumental)\\" – 1:08 # \\"When the Comet Comes\\" – 3:40 #*featuring Beth Ditto # \\"Life in My Own Way\\" – 4:08 # \\"Winter Sun\\" – 4:00 # \\"The Velvet Trail\\" – 5:50 # \\"Finale (Instrumental)\\" – 1:09 ;Bonus tracks (vinyl release only) # * # \\"When the Comet Comes (full length solo version)\\" – 4:06 # \\"The Velvet Trail (radio edit)\\" – 3:27 ==Personnel== *Marc Almond – lead vocals, backing vocals *Christopher Braide \\\\- synths, grand piano, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, programming *Neal X – electric guitar *Martin McCarrick – strings *Kimberlee McCarrick – strings *Louise Marshall – backing vocals *Kelly Barnes – backing vocals *Armen Ra – theremin ==Chart performance== {  - !

Its ancient name was Charadros (Χάραδρος), which is still used, although its Demotic name is by far the most common and used on modern maps. It is not to be confused with the Charadros in Achaea, nor should its modern name be confused with the Xerias in Thessaly nor the Xerias River that flows through Corinth (also known as the Leukon). Under its ancient name, it is described in Pausanias's Description of Greece (2.25.2). ==Geology and hydrology== The Xerias rises in the Parnon massif at Mount Ktenias in Arcadia and flows east to Argos, where it forms the northern boundary of the city, and then turns south and winds around the city's east side before turning east again. It is generally dry in the summer, although flash floods can occur during storms. It meets the Inachos east of the city, from whence the Inachos flows into the Argolic Gulf at Nea Kios, but an interlocking spur continues east and winds around the village of Merbaka. ==Water management== The natural flow of the Xerias has been modified by river engineering, including the creation of pumping stations and reservoirs to control seasonal flooding, improve sanitation, and provide more stable water supplies for agricultural and human use. Periodic flash floods in the area have resulted in bridge scour that has destroyed bridges, roadways and other infrastructure and property in the vicinity of Argos. Serious floods occurred eight times between 1967 and 1997, and recent news reports confirm ongoing problems with flooding in 2014-15. In the wake of catastrophic flooding, there has been disagreement over whether the reservoirs or the practice of filling in of ditches and the planting of citrus trees too close to the river has caused increased flooding, with competing local interests often pointing the finger at the other, and academics and government officials divided on the subject of how best to control the flooding. In addition, some scientists are of the opinion that the removal of wetlands near the mouth of the Xerias to control the spread of mosquitoes and malaria has paradoxically increased area water use in winter because a changing microclimate due to wetlands removal has increased the incidence of frost on local farmers' citrus trees (sprinklers are used to prevent frost build-up). Agronomists are also concerned that increased reliance on groundwater in winter does not give aquifers a chance to replenish, and could lead to aquifer depletion. ==Strategic importance== Because of its strategic location, forming a moat along the border of Argos, the river has been the site of important battles in classical and modern times. Ancient In ancient times, a road led from the Deiras Gate on the north side of the city to Mantinea, and a temple to Ares and Aphrodite was situated along this road, outside the city walls but south of the river. Argive military officers were required to give a report of their conduct here before returning to the city, possibly at a nearby amphitheatre, and sacrifices and religious ceremonies relating to the military were conducted at the temple. In 235 BC, the Charadros was the site of a battle between the forces of Aratus of Sicyon, who was born at Argos and was desirous of liberating the city, and the Macedonian-backed Argive tyrant Aristippus of Argos. The battle was fought to a draw, with Aratus being wounded and retreating back to his fortified camp on one flank, while the other wing of his army routed the forces of Aristippus on the other flank and drove them back to the river. Aratus negotiated the withdrawal of his forces to the north; later, Aristippus would be killed at the battle of Cleonae. Modern On April 25, 1821, the Xerias became the site of a battle between Greek forces and Turks for control of Argos, led by Mustafa, deputy (kehya bey) to the absentee Turkish governor of the Morea, Hurshid Pasha. Mustafa's army included a large contingent of Turkish-allied Cham Albanians under Elmez Aga. The Greeks in the town were led by a triumvirate of Paparsenis Krestas, Demetrios Tsorkis, and Ioannis Yiannouzas, the eldest son of admiral Laskarina Bouboulina. Yiannouzas was slain, along with about 700 other Greeks, including civilians, and according to local accounts, many women and girls were captured by the Turks and sold into slavery. Many of the Greek casualties were inflicted by Turkish artillery fire from across the Xerias. Afterwards, the Turkish forces moved on Nafplio and then to reinforce the Turkish garrison at Tripoli, which was being besieged by the Greeks. Despite their superior numbers and having taken the towns of Nafplio and Argos, the Turks could not or would not take their citadels, possibly due to Mustafa's orders to hurry to the relief of Tripoli, and partly due to problems with his guns, which were suitable for anti-personnel operations but not the reduction of the strong Venetian-engineered fortifications in the Peloponnese. The Turks brought thirty artillery pieces with them and trained gunners, but the artillery seems to have been of sub-standard quality and by the end of the Siege of Tripoli, only seven pieces were found to be in working order. ==References *Satellite map *Car swept away in Xerias flash flood *News article in Greek; includes photographs of infrastructure destroyed by flash flooding Category:Rivers of Greece Category:Landforms of Argolis Category:Rivers of Peloponnese (region) Category:Drainage basins of the Aegean Sea ","title":"Xerias (Argolis)"},{"id":"46401490","text":"Labial vein may refer to: * Inferior labial vein * Posterior labial veins * Superior labial vein ","title":"Labial vein"},{"id":"46401515","text":"Isle of Wight County Museum, located in the Bank of Smithfield building The Isle of Wight County Museum is located in Smithfield, Virginia. ==History== The Isle of Wight County Museum was founded in 1976. Nearly two years before the 1976 United States Bicentennial commemoration, a number of heritage-minded Isle of Wight County citizens believed that the county needed a place where its history could be preserved. As a result of their efforts, the Isle of Wight County Board of Supervisors appointed a multi-talented group of county residents to a commission whose task was to collect, catalog and display artifacts for a new museum. Smithfield's historic 18th-century Gaming House, located at 124 Main Street, was the first home for the collection. The museum opened on November 21, 1976, and for the first three years, dedicated volunteers kept the museum open on Sunday afternoons and at other times by appointment. The museum quickly outgrew its first home as gifts and loans expanded the collection. In 1979, the museum moved into its second historic building, the Bank of Smithfield, built in 1913 and located at 103 Main Street. That same year, the museum commission became a committee under the Isle of Wight County Public Recreational Facilities Authority, which assumed oversight of the museum. In 1990, the Folk Building, a former dry goods store also built in 1913 and located adjacent to the museum, was purchased for the museum's expansion. In 2006, the museum was placed under the newly formed Isle of Wight County Historic Resources Division as a part of Isle of Wight County's Parks and Recreation Department. Shortly thereafter, the division became part of the Smithfield and Isle of Wight County Tourism Department. The museum's growth continued through October 2006 when a nor’easter left the basement flooded with three feet of standing water. Despite the devastating impact of the flood on the museum and its collection, staff, professionals from other Hampton Roads museums, volunteers, concerned citizens and the business community worked tirelessly to re-open the museum in 2008. On June 30, 2014, Isle of Wight County Historic Resources Division was dissolved, and the museum staff members became employees of the Town of Smithfield. Isle of Wight County currently retains ownership of the museum's collection and the building itself. Today, the museum continues to grow. Staffed with a full-time director and curator and several part-time docents, it is open seven days a week and offers special events, research opportunities, public outreach and educational programming to both in-person visitors and social media followers. ==Collections== The museum's exhibits include prehistoric fossils, colonial and pre-colonial artifacts, a turn-of-the-century country store, displays interpreting the Smithfield ham industry and the museum's most notable artifact: the world's oldest, edible cured ham. ==The World's Oldest Ham== P.D. Gwaltney's \\"pet ham\\", thought to be the world's oldest. Gwaltney used the ham to demonstrate his techniques for meat preservation. P.D. Gwaltney Jr.’s famous pet ham currently resides at the Isle of Wight County Museum. In 1902, a cured ham was overlooked, and for 20 years, the ham hung from a rafter in one of Gwaltney's packing houses. By 1924, the pet ham was kept in an iron safe which was opened daily for guests to view. Advertised as the world's oldest Smithfield ham, Gwaltney fashioned a brass collar for the ham and took it to shows and expos to exhibit the preservative powers of his smoking method. The ham was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! in 1929, 1932 and 2003. The museum hosts an annual birthday party for the ham each July, and the museum's Ham Cam keeps tabs on the ham throughout the day. ==Further reading== Historical Notes on Isle of Wight County, Virginia.

He developed an interest in Roman Britain while still at school, but opted for a career as a civil engineer. During World War II he served with the Air Ministry, building airfields, and during this period became engaged in archaeological excavations, most notably in the cities of Canterbury and Lincoln. In Lincoln in 1945 he joined the City Engineer's Department and directed excavations on the Westgate School site which were to reveal the earliest evidence for the Roman Legionary defences of Lincoln. He was also to excavate the Roman pottery kilns at Swanpool and South Carlton.Baker F. T.(1985) A Lifetime with Lincolnshire Archaeology: Looking back over 60 years. The Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology. His growing reputation in the field led to his full-time appointment in 1948 as Curator of the Grosvenor Museum in Chester. While employed there he wrote The Roman Army (1956), which would evolve eventually into his most famous book, The Roman Imperial Army, published in 1969 and in numerous later editions. Webster also studied for an MA at Manchester University and helped organise an archaeological training school at Great Casterton in Rutland. In 1954 he was appointed archaeology tutor in the Extra-Mural Department of Birmingham University. He obtained his PhD from the same institution, with a thesis on Roman strategy in Britain under the governor Ostorius Scapula. He conducted a number of excavations, notably at Whaddon Hill, Dorset and at Barnsley Park, Gloucestershire (1961–79), the latter developing into an archaeological training school and where he met his second wife, Diana (married 1968). Webster's most celebrated excavation, however, was at the abandoned Roman city of Wroxeter near Shrewsbury (1955–85), where he also initiated a training school. In his later years, Webster was a prolific and highly successful writer, with a succession of books on various aspects of Roman Britain. He served as archaeological advisor to Batsford Books, where he oversaw the publication of a formidable list of archaeological works. He received the Order of the British Empire in 1982. Webster is considered one of the pioneering giants of Romano-British excavation. Throughout his long career he gained a reputation as an inspiring archaeological mentor, always willing, despite his enormous commitments, to give advice and practical assistance to both the expert and neophyte. At the time of his death in 2001 he was held in enormous affection by a whole generation of now established archaeologists, remembered as someone generous with both his time and his friendship. ==References== Category:British archaeologists Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:1913 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th- century archaeologists Category:People from Stamford, Lincolnshire ","title":"Graham Webster (archaeologist)"},{"id":"46401526","text":"The 2015 World Senior Curling Championships was from April 18 to 25 at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia.

AD 24), originally named Wang Chang (王昌), became a leader of one of the revolts that rose up towards the end of the Xin dynasty by pretending to be a son of Emperor Cheng of Han. Originally a native of the Zhao State, he was acclaimed as emperor and managed to briefly establish an independent regime in the area of Hebei. ==Life== Wang Lang began his working life as a fortune teller, with expertise in astronomy and calendrics, who determined that Hebei had the qi of a Son of Heaven. Before Wang Mang established the Xin dynasty in AD 9, there was a man living in Chang'an named Liu Ziyu (刘子輿) who claimed to be the son of Emperor Cheng of Han. When Liu Ziyu was murdered on the orders of the Xin dynasty emperor Wang Mang, Wang Lang took the opportunity to pretend to be the real Liu Ziyu. Together with (劉林), son of king Miao of Zhao (赵缪王), he claimed that in order to avoid Empress Zhao Feiyan's persecutions they had fled to Sichuan, and knowing that Hebei had the qi of the Son of Heaven. Liu Lin planned, with the support of the powerful families of Li Yu (李育) and Zhang Can (張参), to declare Wang Lang emperor. At that time there was a rumour that the Red Eyebrows army was crossing the Yellow River heading north. In the tenth month of AD 23, Gengshi Emperor had ordered General Liu Xiu and acting minister of war to pacify Hebei. Upon visiting the city of Handan, Liu Xiu met with Liu Lin, who suggested opening the dams in order to drown the Hebei Red Eyebrows troops. Liu Xiu declined this option, and moved on north, towards (真定). In the twelfth month of the same year, Liu Lin led several hundred horsemen into the city of Handan, and in the early morning arrived at the palace of King Miao of Zhao. Wang Lang was then named emperor. Wang Lang nominated Liu Lin as prime minister, Li Yu Minister of War, and Zhang Can Great General. Wang Lang's army occupied the Ji (冀) and You (幽) counties, and took advantage of the public's positive attitude towards the Han dynasty by claiming that the general who opposed Wang Mang before the Xin dynasty was established, had not yet died and was in support of them. This gained them much popularity and support amongst the populace. Wang Lang controlled the state of Zhao from its north, and Liaodong peninsula from its eastern end, and offered a price of ten marquise- level bronze vessels for anyone who would bring the severed head of Liu Xiu. However, by the beginning of 24 AD, Liu Xiu had gathered troops and consolidated power with and leading over two thousand troops to back him. Geng Kuang (耿況), the governor of Shanggu and , the governor of Yuyang Commandery (漁陽), sent cavalry to provide support to Liu Xiu. With all the forces now available to Liu Xiu , Wang Lang suffered a series of defeats in Hebei. During the fourth month of AD 24 Liu Xiu marched into Handan, and during the fifth month the city of Handan was conquered. Wang Lang escaped from Handan but was soon caught and killed. According to the Later Han History he was killed by , one of Liu Xiu's generals.Later Han History, \\"Biography of Wang Ba\\" (王霸传). ==Notes== Category:1st-century BC births Category:24 deaths Category:Han dynasty people ","title":"Wang Lang (Xin dynasty)"},{"id":"46401601","text":"Simonsville is a ghost town in Clark County, Nevada, that was located on the east bank of the Muddy River west of the south end of the Overton Airport in the Moapa Valley. ==History== Simonsville was originally called Mill Point for the grist mill first built there by James Leithead.

The center has a coat of arms: a white hand holding a red flame, symbolizing solidarity with the Dominican nation. The upper part of the coat of arms has the party's acronym () in navy blue. Under the coat of arms is the party’s motto: Democracia, Justicia y Solidaridad (Democracy, Justice, and Solidarity). The PCR anthem was written by party president Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna to encourage societal development and well-being, regardless of personal religion or beliefs. == President== The president is the party's spokesperson and official representative and presides over the National Assembly, the National Direction, and the Executive Commission. They may convoke the National Direction, Executive Commission, and Political Commission whenever necessary to resolve an urgent situation affecting the country or the PCR. The president presides over every PCR meeting, designates the commission of assessors, convokes extraordinary National Assembly meetings, and administers party income and expenses with the director of finance. Party founder Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna is the current president. A follower of Juan Pablo Duarte, Gregorio Luperón, José Francisco Peña Gómez, and Juan Bosch, Zorrilla Ozuna bases the party's ideology on \\"serving the country, the people, and every Dominican; rescuing our origins and defending full democracy\\" and believes strongly that \\"a country without education, food, health, home, or equality cannot fully develop\\". ==Progressive Renovator Pact== The Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), represented by president Leonel Fernández, secretary-general Reinaldo Pared Pérez and Danilo Medina, signed the Progressive Renovation Pact with the PCR, represented by president Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna and secretary-general Franklin White, on January 8, 2012.

Lewis was also featured on the 2nd Annual 2016 Dick Wagner Memorial Concert 'Remember The Child\\" at The Fillmore Detroit. The show honored DJ Russ Gibb, a former concert promoter and media personality from Dearborn, Michigan, and commemorated the late guitarist/singer/songwriter Dick Wagner. Wagner's music was performed by many artists including Wagner's son Robert Wagner, Jean Beauvoir, Grammy Award- winning pianist and singer from The Waterboys Paul Brown, drummer Sandy Gennaro, guitarist Micki Free, Derek St. Holmes, Joe Bass, Hal Patino, Maryann Cotton, Jimmie \\"Bones\\" Trombly, guitarist Kenny Olson, Peter Keys, David Winans II, Muruga Booker, Dennis Dunaway, The Frost, Johnny \\"Bee\\" Badanjek and other supporting musicians. Proceeds benefited Children's Miracle Network Hospitals supporting music therapy. On March 24, 2017, Lewis performed with Suzi Quatro as one of The Pleasure Seekers, along the latter's sister Patti Quatro, on the third annual \\"Remember the Child Concert\\" held in Detroit, Michigan at the MotorCity Casino Hotel in The Sound Board performance venue. She also contributed backing vocals for Mark Farner, Kip Winger and many returning artists from the previous year. ==Partial discography== This is a partial discography on which Laurie Beebe Lewis contributes vocals or instrumentation: Albums Solo *1997 - Laurie K.

It is approximately long and flows through Roaring Brook Township and Moscow. The creek has one named tributary, which is known as Langan Creek. At least two bridges have been constructed across Van Brunt Creek. ==Course== Van Brunt Creek begins in Mullen Swamp in Roaring Brook Township. It flows southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning south and entering Moscow. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns southeast for several tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 690, before turning east. After several tenths of a mile it receives Langan Creek, its only named tributary, from the right. It then crosses Pennsylvania Route 435 and turns north-northeast for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with Roaring Brook. Tributaries Van Brunt Creek has one named tributary, which is known as Langan Creek, which joins Van Brunt Creek in Moscow. It also has a number of unnamed tributaries. ==Hydrology== Upstream of Langan Creek, the peak annual discharge of Van Brunt Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 428 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 731 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 884 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 1307 cubic feet per second. Approximately upstream of Cross Section Letter K, the peak annual discharge of Van Brunt Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 379 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 647 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 784 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 1160 cubic feet per second. The North Pocono Public Library in Moscow once applied for a permit to discharge stormwater into Van Brunt Creek for construction purposes. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Van Brunt Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. A soil known as the Wellsboro extremely stony loam occurs in the vicinity of Van Brunt Creek. The surficial geology in the creek's vicinity mainly consists of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. However, alluvium is present along the creek in its middle and upper reaches and there are some patches of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Drift in the watershed, as well as a few patches of bedrock consisting of conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale. There are also wetlands in the creek's headwaters and two patches of fill near the creek. ==Watershed and biology== Van Brunt Creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Moscow. Upstream of the tributary Langan Creek, its watershed has an area of . The creek is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Van Brunt Creek is one of the main sources of flooding in Moscow, as its tributary Langan Creek. ==History== Van Brunt Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1200124. A concrete arch bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 435 was built over Van Brunt Creek in 1940. It is long and is situated in Moscow. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built over the creek in Moscow in the same year. This bridge is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 690. The latter bridge has been given a weight limit of 28 tons, or 38 tons for combination loads. One case of typhoid was observed in the vicinity of Van Brunt Creek in the early 1910s. ==See also== *Kellum Creek, next tributary of Roaring Brook going downstream *Bear Brook (Roaring Brook), next tributary of Roaring Brook going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References *Google Street View image of Van Brunt Creek Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of Roaring Brook (Lackawanna River) Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Van Brunt Creek"},{"id":"46401819","text":"Edit-a-thon for Black History Month at Howard University, a historically-black university Black Lunch Table in New Orleans The English Wikipedia has been criticized for having a systemic racial bias in its coverage. This stems in part from an under-representation of non-white people within its editor base. In \\"Can History Be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past,\\" it is noted that article completeness and coverage is dependent on the interests of Wikipedians, not necessarily on the subject matter itself. The past president of Wikimedia D.C., James Hare, noted that \\"a lot of black history is left out\\" of Wikipedia, due to articles predominately being written by white editors. Articles that do exist on African topics are, according to some, largely edited by editors from Europe and North America and thus reflect only their knowledge and consumption of media, which \\"tend to perpetuate a negative image\\" of Africa. Maira Liriano of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, has argued that the lack of information regarding black history on Wikipedia \\"makes it seem like it's not important.\\" Different theories have been provided to explain these racial discrepancies. Jay Cassano, writing for Fast Company magazine, argued that Wikipedia's small proportion of black editors is a result of the small black presence within the technology sector, and a relative lack of reliable access to the Internet. Katherine Maher, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, has argued that the specific focuses in Wikipedia's content are representative of those of society as a whole. She said that Wikipedia could only represent that which was referenced in secondary sources, which historically have been favorable towards and focused on white men. \\"Studies have shown that content on Wikipedia suffers from the bias of its editors – [who are] mainly technically inclined, English- speaking, white-collar men living in majority-Christian, developed countries in the Northern hemisphere\\". In addition to the racial bias on Wikipedia, public encyclopedias are generally vulnerable to vandalism by hate groups like white nationalists. == Research findings and analysis == Few academic studies have focused on racial bias on Wikipedia. In an academic analysis of the Wikipedia edit history of Origins of the American Civil War, one conclusion was that, despite aiming for a neutral point of view, Wikipedia content can be a result of a \\"moral economy of crowdsourcing.\\" During a course and subsequent academic article examining women's historical representation on Wikipedia, it was observed that some editors have an \\"American exceptionalism\\" bias that prevents representation of minority groups' histories on Wikipedia. In a 2014 study attempting to quantify phenomenology of racism, the Wikipedia microaggression article and corresponding talk page were used as an example that the testimonies of people of color and individuals from marginalized communities are oftentimes not adequate for white listeners to believe them. The concerns on the talk page focused on neutrality because biases white people experience were not discussed and the disbelief of the existence of microaggressions, despite their prevalence at the time in academic journals. According to Maira Liriano, the associate chief librarian at New York City's Schomburg Center, one of the biggest challenges is getting new editors to keep editing Wikipedia after the edit-a-thon is over. One challenge with retaining new editors is that the \\"[n]erdy white guys\\" who predominate as Wikipedia editors \\"…aren't always warm and nurturing\\" to new editors. For example, when new editors add content on Black history, their content may be deleted by established editors. As well, when new editors are trying to advocate for the inclusion of Black history content on Wikipedia's talk pages (each article has an associated talk page for discussion of changes), the \\"[c]omments [to new editors] on [Wikipedia article] talk pages can be very blunt.\\" An issue for women of colour is that \\"women in many communities have less leisure time than men,\\" according to Siko Bouterse, the director of community resources at the Wikimedia Foundation. Another challenge for editors trying to add Black history articles to Wikipedia is the requirement that potential article topics, such as historical individuals or events, meet Wikipedia's \\"notability\\" criteria. Sara Boboltz of HuffPost wrote that the Wikipedia notability criteria \\"…is a troubling problem for those fighting for more content about women and minorities\\", because \\"…there's simply less [published] documentation on many accomplished women and minorities throughout history -- they were often ignored, after all, or forced to make their contributions as someone else's assistant\\". Maher stated that one issue is that \\"…content on Wikipedia has to be backed up by secondary sources, sources that she says throughout history have contained a bias toward white men\\"; \\"…people of color have not been represented in mainstream knowledge creation or inclusion in that knowledge,\\" as \\"…encyclopedias of old were mostly written by European men.\\" Another issue is the \\"often abusive relationships between editors\\" on talk pages, which \\"…can make Wikipedia a less than welcoming place for …minority groups looking to get involved\\" in editing Wikipedia. The Wikipedia editing \\"...community can also appear hostile, both to outsiders looking in and to those involved in it\\" by editing articles; indeed, article \\"[t]alk pages [discussions about articles] routinely devolve into seemingly petty arguments\\". There has been \\"...criticism of bias [on Wikipedia], both on individual pages [articles] and as a systemic mind-set that the editing network has as a whole.\\" William Beutler, author of the blog The Wikipedian and a consultant on Wikipedia issues for clients, states that \\"...certain areas of Wikipedia, including certain political areas of Wikipedia...tend to be controlled by a small number of editors who tend to see things the same way.\\" Various communities have raised concerns about \\"...Wikipedia and its editors, saying that the pages had obvious systemic bias against them.\\" According to Peter Reynosa, \\"there is an underrepresentation of Latinos who write for Wikipedia.\\" He asks, > And what does it mean if there is a lack of Latinos editing and writing > Wikipedia entries? What’s the harm? The answer: many topics may remain > uncovered, or at the least these topics will not be given the attention they > deserve. There is also the issue of bias: White males don’t always > accurately portray topics that relate to minorities. In 2018 the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized Wikipedia for being \\"vulnerable to manipulation by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and racist academics seeking a wider audience for extreme views.\\" According to the SPLC, \\"Civil POV-pushers can disrupt the editing process by engaging other users in tedious and frustrating debates or tie up administrators in endless rounds of mediation. Users who fall into this category include racialist academics and members of the human biodiversity, or HBD, blogging community... In recent years, the proliferation of far-right online spaces, such as white nationalist forums, alt-right boards and HBD blogs, has created a readymade pool of users that can be recruited to edit on Wikipedia en masse... The presence of white nationalists and other far-right extremists on Wikipedia is an ongoing problem that is unlikely to go away in the near future given the rightward political shift in countries where the majority of the site’s users live.\\" The SPLC cited the article Race and intelligence as an example of the alt-right influence on Wikipedia, stating that at that time the article presented a \\"false balance\\" between fringe racialist views and the \\"mainstream perspective in psychology.\\" In June 2020, Wikipedia was described in Slate as a \\"Battleground for Racial Justice\\" in response to criticisms of neutrality, coverage of George Floyd and his killing, Black Lives Matter, and article deletion nominations for the founders of Black Birders Week. While Wikipedia editors and users grapple with how the idea of neutrality affects coverage of racial justice, journalists and newsrooms are similarly working to differentiate between objectivity and truth. == Geographical bias == A 2009 article by Mark Graham in The Guardian presented a color-coded map of the world that illustrated the disparity between the numbers of geotagged Wikipedia articles for countries from the Global North and from the Global South. Graham wrote, > Almost the entire continent of Africa is geographically poorly represented > in Wikipedia. Remarkably, there are more Wikipedia articles written about > Antarctica than all but one of the 53 countries in Africa (or perhaps more > amazingly, there are more Wikipedia articles written about the fictional > places of Middle Earth and Discworld than about many countries in Africa, > Asia, and the Americas). Additionally, in a 2010 study, an analysis of Wikipedia editors revealed that 40% are located in North America, 28% in Europe, and 17% in Asia; 6%, 4%, and 3% were in Africa, Australia, and South America, respectively. These editor demographics do not align with population of each continent, especially Asia, Africa, and South America which respectively contain 60%, 15%, and 9% of the world's population. == Responses == AfroCROWD presents at WikiConference North America, August 2017 Attempts have been made to rectify racial biases through edit-a-thons, organised events at which Wikipedia editors attempt to improve coverage of certain topics and train new editors. In February 2015, multiple edit-a-thons were organised to commemorate Black History Month in the United States. One such edit-a-thon was organized by the White House to create and improve articles on African Americans in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Schomburg Center, Howard University, and National Public Radio, also coordinated edit-a-thons to improve coverage of black history. \\"Wikipedia editors… have held 'edit-a-thons,'\\" to \\"....encourage others to come learn how to…contribute content on subjects that have been largely ignored.\\" Liriano has endorsed Wikipedia edit-a-thons, stating that for Wikipedia's content to \\"…be representative, everyone has to participate.\\" In 2015 and 2016, the Schomburg Center held a \\"Black Lives Matters\\" edit-a- thon to coincide with Black History Month. Volunteer editors added coverage about Black historical individuals and about key concepts in black culture (e.g., about the Harlem Book Fair and about Black costume designer Judy Dearing). New articles about Black history and Black historical individuals were also created. The 2016 edit-a-thon was organized by AfroCROWD. Wikipedia editors Michael Mandiberg and Dorothy Howard have organized diversity-themed edit-a-thons to \\"…help raise awareness of some of the glaring holes on Wikipedia, and the need for people with diverse backgrounds and knowledge to fill them\\". Liriano stated \\"It's really important that people of color know that there's this gap\\" of coverage of Black history on Wikipedia \\"…and they can correct it\\" by participating as editors. In the US, the National Science Foundation has provided $200,000 to fund research on the issue of bias in the coverage of topics in Wikipedia. The National Science Foundation has commissioned two studies of why there is bias in Wikipedia editing. The Wikimedia Foundation is trying to deal with the issue of racial bias in Wikipedia. In 2015, it was reported that the Wikimedia Foundation made numerous grants \\"…to organizations in the \\"Global South\\"—including Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East—with plans to improve [coverage of Global South topics in] Wikipedia.\\" While Wikipedia supports these edit-a- thons, the organization has always stressed that adequate citations must always be present and neutrality must always be maintained. Wikipedia co- founder Jimmy Wales has stated that the Wikimedia Foundation has \\"completely failed\\" to meet its goals of resolving the lack of diversity amongst Wikipedia editors. == See also == *Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias * Criticism of Wikipedia * Gender bias on Wikipedia == References  External links == *Can Black Wikipedia take Black Twitter *Wikipedia getting lesson Black history Category:Criticism of Wikipedia Category:Discrimination Category:Ethnocentrism Category:Racism ","title":"Racial bias on Wikipedia"},{"id":"46401833","text":"Ottessa Charlotte Moshfegh (born 1981) is an American author and novelist.

This transcription factor is found in adults in the cerebellum, kidneys, and cerebrum, but plays a larger role in development of the fetal head and the female reproductive tract during gestation. During development it is found in the anterior visceral endoderm, is in tissues formed by the primitive streak, and is required in both tissues for head formation. Lim1 is a member of the LIM homeobox gene and encodes a 406 amino acid protein. == Effects on formation of the future head == In mice, Lim-1 acts in the early development of the mesoderm and ectoderm layers of the developing embryo. The factor is induced by the increasing concentrations of Cerebrus, DKK1, and Nodal around day 7–9 in the mouse embryo. Lim-1 contributes to the formation of the anterior portion of the developing head containing the forebrain and midbrain. Research studies have shown that knocking out Lim-1 in mice will cause a range of head deformities, including the complete lack of formation of the head. == Effects on formation of the female reproductive tract == Lim-1 is also essential for the development of the female reproductive tract, as it causes the persistence of the mullerian ducts that will eventually develop into the oviducts, uterus, cervix, and vagina. Without the expression of Lim-1, formation of the epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the reproductive tract will not occur. While the ovaries will develop, female mice will develop without a uterus and oviducts.Kobayashi, A., W. Shawlot, A. Kania, and R. R. Behringer. 2003. Requirement of Lim1 for the reproductive tract development. Develop. 131: 539-549. http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/131/3/539.full.pdfShawlot, W., M. Wakamiya, K. M. Kwan, A. Kania, T. M. Jessell, and R. R. Behringer. 1999. Lim1 is required in both primitive streak derived tissues and visceral endoderm for head formation in the mouse. Develop. 126: 4925-4932. http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/126/22/4925.full.pdf == Ssdp1 Regulation On Lim-1 == Lim-1 is a transcription factor we have learned about in class to control head and limb development. In our lecture, we learned that the primitive node will secrete the signaling molecules “Lefty” and “Cerebus” that then induce the expression of Lim-1, which will then induce formation of head structures. In one research article, “headshrinker mutants”, were also defined by the Ssdp1 gene being disrupted, which also seemed to be associated with defects in the head induction process. It turns out that this data showed Ssdp1 causing “defects in prechordal plate development and anterior truncations.” This data also discloses that Ssdp1 is a coactivator that enhances transcriptional activity with Lim-1 as a complex. These phenotypes expressed by Ssdp1 mutants most likely reflect reduced activity of a Lim-1 complex. So, while Lim-1 acts as the transcription factor heavily responsible for head development, there are many other factors that affect expression of the normal head phenotype. ==In mice== Lim1 is down regulated after embryonic day 7.5. Then, the Lim1 gene, with help from the anterior definitive mesoderm, goes to regulate sequential signaling from the anterior visceral endoderm. This signal regulation is necessary for head formation. The Lim1 gene is also expressed in adult life, possibly to maintain a differentiated state in neural tissue of adults. During embryogenesis, Lim1 is expressed from the central nervous system (CNS) and the excretory system (primarily the kidney). In the CNS, it is expressed approximately 10 days after fertilization and patterns the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord regions. In the spinal cord Lim1 is expressed in dorsal and lateral parts but is not detected in the ventricular region. ==References== Category:Mouse genes ","title":"Lim1 transcription factor"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function L(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(F,[["render",L]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/40.md","filePath":"quotes/40.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/40.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{x as __pageData,E as default};
