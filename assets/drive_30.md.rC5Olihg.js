The novel is a fictionalized biography of her grandmother, Suzanne Meloche, a poet and painter who interacted with many French-Canadian artists and historical events. Much of the information is based on the findings of a private investigator hired by Barbeau-Lavalette to find information on her grandmother's life. The novel was first released in the French language in Canada through the publishing house Marchand de feuilles during 2015. It received an English translation through Coach House Books, which released it during 2017. == Themes == In discussing Suzanne's life and experiences, the novel explores social change by referencing multiple historical events. The narrator examines how her grandmother was involved in and influenced by these events. Often, the large-scale events presented intertwine with and echo the familial events of the novel itself. The novel is praised for presenting these events in human terms. The novel presents history about Quebec that is often overlooked, allowing a less-considered perspective to be represented in literature. The story examines the conflicting roles of motherhood and career. Through the life events of Suzanne Meloche, the narrator explores notions of feminism and familial obligation, as Suzanne chooses to leave her children in pursuit of art and personal freedom. While Barbeau-Lavalette expresses her anger at Suzanne and at her decisions through her narration, the narrator also seeks both to explain Suzanne's behavior and to allow the reader to sympathize with her actions. == Plot summary == The novel begins in the present day as the narrator, Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette, and her mother (Manon Barbeau) discover that Suzanne has died and they are the sole heirs. They visit Suzanne's apartment and find photos, reviews, and poems that will be featured later in the novel. The novel then shifts to a second- person account of Suzanne's early life. Born into a family impoverished by the Great Depression in Canada, as a teenager, Suzanne is eager to explore life beyond Ottawa. Her desire to explore beyond Ottawa is also inspired by her admiration of Hilda Strike, a Canadian runner that she watched race in the 1932 Olympics. Having cultivated her gift for writing and public speaking, she uses her gift to garner attention and then joins a group of avant-garde artists including the writer Claude Gauvreau and the painter Marcel Barbeau, in Montreal. Suzanne marries Marcel on June 7, 1948. Paul-Émile Borduas, leader of the Automatistes, leads the group in composing the manifesto for free speech, Refus Global. Suzanne initially signs, but later redacts her signature when Borduas rejects her poetry. Her first child, Mousse, is born in 1949 (who will grow up to be the famous film maker Manon Barbeau). The group of artists has been blacklisted, so Marcel and Suzanne move with their friends to the countryside. Suzanne gives birth to François. Marcel has a breakdown in New York, but when she comes to attend to him, she starts a relationship with Borduas. She leaves Marcel and abandons the children at a daycare in the countryside. Marcel's sister eventually agrees to take in Mousse and an undertaker and his wife take in Francois. By this time Suzanne has started a new relationship and runs off with her friend's lover, Peter, to travel the world; but after a terminated pregnancy she returns to Montreal. She invites Mousse to live with her but her invitation is refused. Suzanne moves to Harlem in New York and begins to date a woman named Selena. Together, they join the Freedom Riders.The first few stops go well, but eventually the KKK attacks the bus and destroys it. By the age of 40, Suzanne is living in Manhattan. There she meets Gary Adams, a man scarred from his experiences in Vietnam. Her son François repeatedly tries to contact her but Suzanne refuses to meet with him. While living in Ottawa, Suzanne meets and becomes friends with her childhood hero, Hilda Strike. The novel then revisits the author's interactions with her grandmother, but from Suzanne's perspective. On December 23, 2009, Suzanne dies, leaving her estate to Mousse and her children. Back in the present, the narrator is living in the countryside taking care of her infant daughter. She contemplates how Suzanne's abandonment affected her mother and family dynamic. Nevertheless, she recognizes the debt that the family owes Suzanne, and she promises to remember her. == Major characters == In order of appearance in the novel: * Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette: The author herself serves as the narrator of the book and plays an active role in the beginning and ending of the novel. * Suzanne Meloche: She is the main character of the novel, based on Barbeau- Lavalette's grandmother. The majority of the events in the novel are described from her second-person perspective. She has a gift for writing, speaking, and painting. Throughout her life, she has several love affairs and two children, Mousse and François. She is plagued with guilt about abandoning them, but does not wish to have them in her life. * Hilda Strike: She was a Canadian runner in the 1932 Olympic Games. She came in second to Stella Walsh, an athlete who was later found to be intersex. Suzanne Meloche was inspired by her athleticism, and both women coincidentally spent the later years of their life living in the same apartment complex. She became a personal friend to Suzanne Meloche. * Marcel Barbeau: He is a famous French-Canadian artist, Suzanne's ex-husband, and father to Mousse and François. He was part of the original group of artists that created the free speech manifesto Refus Global. * Paul- Émile Borduas: Borduas began the Automatistes movement, and he wrote the text that accompanied the Refus Global. He had a brief affair with Suzanne Meloche while she was still married to Marcel Barbeau. * Mousse (Manon) Barbeau: Mousse Barbeau is Suzanne's first child. She is the mother of the narrator, Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette. She is raised largely by her aunt after her mother abandons her and her brother, François. She chooses not to move back in with Suzanne when given the option later in her childhood. She later becomes a successful French-Canadian filmmaker and creates a documentary about Refus Global. * François Barbeau: François Barbeau is Suzanne Meloche's second child and Mousse's brother. He is raised by an abusive undertaker, which causes him to develop and unspecified mental disorder. * Peter: Peter is Suzanne's lover who travels with her to the countryside, Montreal, Brussels, and his family home in London. She leaves him after becoming pregnant and having an abortion. * Selena: She is Suzanne's African American lover who gives her a place to stay in Harlem and invites her to join the Freedom Riders. * Gary Adams: Gary is Suzanne's last lover. He writes poetry and suffers PTSD from his experiences in the Vietnam War. He eventually dies from suicide. == Structure == Barbeau-Lavalette serves as the narrator for this piece and directs a second person point of view at Suzanne Meloche. This very personal perspective conveys the intense emotional impact of the relationship between the protagonist, Suzanne, and the narrator/author. Critics such as Ian McGillis claim that it reinforces the novel's structure and unifies the story across several decades. A first person perspective is briefly utilized at the beginning and end of the novel, while the narrator recounts events in the present. Suzanne is written with a circular structure; the beginning and end discuss events from the same time period while the middle elaborates. The novel is divided into subsections of different time periods in chronological order, with the exception of the beginning, which starts in the present-day. The novel is written in short, generally page-length sections, focusing on a single key idea. According to McGillis, these short sections and sentences were intended to convey a fleeting effect, mimicking the constant movement of Suzanne from place to place. The prose of the novel is direct and brief. This brevity was also intended by the author to reflect the constant changes in Suzanne's life and surroundings. This style was kept for the English translation of the book. == Setting == The novel begins in Ottawa, where Suzanne Meloche was raised, but then shifts to Montreal, where Suzanne attends the College Marguerite-Bourgeoys. Though much of the middle of the book is set in Montreal, she and her husband, Marcel, as artists, frequently visit New York. After her divorce, she travels to Brussels and London. She returns to Montreal and then to New York. By the end of the novel, she settles back in Ottawa. == Historical background == Many important historical events color the action in Suzanne from 1930 to 2009. The novel is divided into six sections, each covering one to two decades. Multiple historical events influenced Suzanne's life and Suzanne was involves herself in movements for social change. In describing these movements, the narrator discusses themes such as feminism, poverty, Marxism, patriarchy, and racism. By highlighting Suzanne's participation in historical events, the narrator establishes Suzanne as a notable figure, on the same level as her more famous friends. === The Canadian Great Depression === Suzanne Meloche lived in an impoverished household during the Canadian Great Depression, which fuels her later desire to explore life beyond Ottawa. In discussing Suzanne's family, particularly her father, during the Great Depression, the narrator comments on the nature of unemployment and government-assigned temporary work, commenting on the policies of Premier Maurice Duplessis, who held office during the Great Depression. Duplessis was a very conservative leader who supported rural areas, economic development, and a strong investment in Catholic education, while opposing labor unions, communists, and any anti-establishment group. Suzanne's later involvement in anti-establishment artistic movements such as the Automatistes, sharply contrasts with her conservative upbringing. This rejection of her upbringing characterizes her as a rebel throughout her life.A picture of an art exhibition put on by Les Automatistes in 1947. Suzanne Meloche was a part of this group. === Les Automatistes === Suzanne Meloche participated in the Les Automatistes movement as a college student, alongside important Canadian artists such as Claude Gauvreau, Françoise Sullivan, and Jean-Paul Riopelle, who are characters within the novel. The Les Automatistes movement contributed heavily to the Canadian Quiet Revolution. The book discusses the creation of their manifesto, Refus Global, as well as the art Suzanne created within the movement, such as her book of poetry, Les Aurores Fulminantes. According to Barbeau-Lavalette, through discussing this art movement, the narrator also explores Marxist, secular, and psychoanalytic ideas that influence Suzanne's development. These ideas contrast the politically conservative ideas that influenced Suzanne's youth. This rebellion through art also established Suzanne as a woman who was stifled by the societal roles in which she was placed, which would later factor into Suzanne's decision to leave her children. === Freedom Rides === Suzanne Meloche participates in a Freedom Ride in 1961, going from Washington, D.C. to Jackson, Mississippi in order to peacefully protest segregation. Suzanne was on a bus that was firebombed in Anniston, Alabama, and she would later be arrested for participating in these protests and held in the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Suzanne was one of the few white women who participated in this protest. The narrator, by discussing this event, expressed her concerns regarding racism and her recognition of the importance of the civil rights movement. Barbeau-Lavalette takes a strong stance against racism across many of her works. The narrator also reflects on Suzanne's participation in this event as a way for Suzanne to serve a higher cause and to potentially justify leaving her children and husband behind earlier in the novel. == Critical response == Suzanne was a bestseller in Quebec and other French-speaking areas, particularly France. It was discussed on Tout le monde en parle and placed on CEGEP course lists throughout Canada. The translation by Rhonda Mullins has found similar success, and this translation was nominated for a 2019 Canada Reads award by actor Yanic Truesdale, who praised it for its portrayal of women and cultural identity. Barbeau-Lavalette herself praised Rhonda Mullins' translation for keeping the novel's rhythm and emotional intensity intact within the English version. It was also nominated for the 2018 BTBA Best Translated Book Award Longlist. The novel was also awarded the \\"Prix des libraires du Québec.\\" The novel was highly praised for its writing style and use of language, specifically its use of second person perspective and of its direct, choppy structure. Reviewers also discussed the novel's success in covering a wide stretch of history while still engaging the reader. == References == Category:2015 Canadian novels ","title":"Suzanne (novel)"},{"id":"60414288","text":"Silvia Persico (born 25 July 1997) is an Italian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Silvia Persico"},{"id":"60414298","text":"Silvia Pollicini (born 31 December 1998) is an Italian professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Italian female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Silvia Pollicini"},{"id":"60414300","text":"Krygier is a surname.

A professor at Stony Brook University since 2010, he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2015 and awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 2019. == Biography == Chen was born in Qingtian County, Zhejiang, China. He entered the Department of Mathematics of the University of Science and Technology of China in 1982, and graduated in 1987. He subsequently studied under Peng Jiagui (彭家贵) at the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he earned his master's degree. In 1989, he moved to the United States to study at the University of Pennsylvania. The last doctoral student of Eugenio Calabi, he obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1994, with his dissertation on \\"Extremal Hermitian Matrices with Curvature Distortion in a Riemann Surface\\". Chen was an instructor at McMaster University in Canada from 1994 to 1996. For the next two years he was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. He was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1998 to 2002, before becoming an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He was promoted to full professor in 2005. Since October 2010 he has been a professor at Stony Brook University. In 2006, he founded the Pacific Rim Conference on Complex Geometry at the University of Science and Technology of China. As of 2019, Chen has advised 17 Ph.D. students, including Song Sun and Bing Wang (王兵). He was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2015 \\"for contributions to differential geometry, particularly the theory of extremal Kahler metrics\\". He was an invited speaker at the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians, in Beijing. == Conjecture on Fano manifolds and Veblen Prize == In 2019, Chen was awarded the prestigious Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry, together with Simon Donaldson and Chen's former student Song Sun, for proving a long-standing conjecture on Fano manifolds, which states \\"that a Fano manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable\\". It had been one of the most actively investigated topics in geometry since its proposal in the 1980s by Shing-Tung Yau after he proved the Calabi conjecture. It was later generalized by Gang Tian and Donaldson.

Her work is honored and continued by the Lalor Foundation and Burdick Career High School in Washington, D.C. == Career == Burdick taught from school to school, but she stayed in the Des Moines area. After graduating from University of Iowa in 1889, she taught at West Des Moines High School until 1891. She became the principal of Iowa Falls High School in 1894 and kept her position for three years. In 1902, she moved on to become the superintendent of Iowa Falls and Alden Community School Districts. On September 25, 1912, she presented “The Re-Organization of Our Educational System to Fit the Social and Industrial Needs of the Community” at the Better Iowa Schools Commission. The Commission later on described it as “one of the most attractive features” that presented “much interesting material”. In 1917, she served the U.S. Department of Education as a special agent for the Trade and Industrial Education for Girls and Women. Three years later, the Federal Board for Vocational Education published two editions of her work under the same name. She remained at the U.S. Department of Education until her retirement in 1939. == Personal life == Burdick was born September 3, 1869 in Villisca, Iowa to John E. Lalor and Margaret Lalor. In 1891, she married Frank Austin Burdick, but later divorced. Together, they had two daughters—Imelda and Bennie—and three sons—Norbert, Leonard, and Frances.

The program isn’t necessarily focused on women’s vocational education, but on pro-choice reproductive health information. Their mission statement says they’re dedicated to \\"young women who have inadequate access to information regarding reproductive health, including the subjects of contraception and pregnancy termination, and as such may be particularly lacking options in their lives\\". The Lalor Foundation’s website quotes her saying to young girls at a 1938 educational conference, \\"Your problem is not to choose between marriage and career, but rather to plan a vocation and career and still be happily married. If a girl chooses not to marry, she needs a means of self- support. If she does marry, catastrophe often changes her plans.\\" === Burdick Career High School === Originally named the Anna Burdick Vocational High School, Burdick Career High School was built as a vocational high school for girls in Washington, D.C.

She was a Women Airforce Service Pilot and one of only twenty-six WASPs to pilot a Lockheed P-38 Lightning during World War II. == Family and early Life == Ramsey was raised in Illinois and Kansas. Her father worked as a \\"wildcatter\\" in oil fields and was often away from home. Ramsey and her younger brother, Edwin, often witnessed their father hitting their mother. When she was seventeen, her father was arrested for spousal abuse after Nadine and Edwin had to drag him away from their mother. That night, he committed suicide in his cell. After his death, Ramsey's mother raised the children alone. To help support her family, Ramsey dropped out of school and became a secretary. After work, she would go to the nearby Beechcraft plane factory for flying lessons. At first, she kept her lessons a secret from most people, believing a woman pilot would be considered scandalous. She gave flying lessons to Edwin, who described her as “an expert, instinctive flier.” Ramsey's mother, Nelle, was a cosmetologist and dermatologist. Her brother became an officer in the US Army and a guerrilla leader in the Philippines during World War II. == Aviation career == Ramsey became an aviator in 1937, making headlines when she flew a Kansas airmail route on May 19, 1938. She and Charlotte Frye were the first women to carry mail for the Postal Service. On May 22, she flew in an airshow in Hutchinson, Kansas. By 1940, Ramsey was living in Manhattan Beach, California, where she advertised and sold Taylorcraft airplanes. She also carried passengers for a fee. On September 2, 1940, Ramsey was flying over the mountains near Lake Henshaw with a passenger named Gertrude Snow. As she tried to land, the plane's landing gear hit a tree, causing it to nosedive. Snow received \\"fractures of both arms and a badly mangled leg\\". Ramsey was treated for \\"possible serious internal injuries\\". Her back and several of her ribs were broken, and she was badly concussed. One of her legs was nearly amputated, but a friend, claiming to speak for her family, had Ramsey transferred to an LA hospital where doctors saved the leg. Edwin dropped out of law school to care for her while she recovered. By December, Ramsey could walk, and by February, she was flying again. Ramsey joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots in 1943. She graduated with the 43 W-5 Class on September 12, 1943. Ramsey went on to pursuit school, where she learned to fly fighter planes, graduating on May 1, 1944. As a WASP, Ramsey piloted PT-19, BT-13, UC-78, AT-6, P-39, P-47 P-51, and P-63 planes. She was also one of the twenty- six WASPs who flew a Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Ramsey was initially stationed at Love Field, Texas, but asked to be transferred to the Long Beach Army Air Base in California, where she ferried fighter aircraft and was an instructor in \\"preflight transition\\". After the WASPs were disbanded, she stayed on the base as an attaché to the Sixth Army Ferrying Group. In 1945, Ramsey bought her own P-38, an Army surplus, in Kingman, Arizona. The plane cost 1,250 dollars. Ramsey flew her P-38 for two and a half years, selling the plane when she could no longer afford to maintain it. ==References== Category:American female aviators Category:Aviators from Kansas Category:Women Airforce Service Pilots Category:1911 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American women in World War II Category:United States airmail pilots ","title":"Nadine B.

While this hybrid does not possess the cold hardiness of the Iranian poppy (Papaver bracteatum), it does possess notably more cold tolerance than Papaver somniferum and in a greenhouse or protected setting could be grown as a perennial. Another notable feature of this hybrid is that it contains a higher concentration of morphinian alkaloids (including morphine) than any known cultivar of Papaver somniferum and Papaver bracteatum. This is despite one of its parents (Papaver bracteatum) producing negligible concentrations of morphine and is believed to be due to a greater expression of one of the rate-limiting enzymes of morphine synthesis. == References == * * Category:Interspecific plant hybrids Category:Morphine somniferum × bracteatum ","title":"Papaver somniferum × bracteatum"},{"id":"60414893","text":"Nick Kosir with Congresswoman Alma Adams in 2019 Nick Kosir is an American meteorologist.

Huettig moved from Michigan to Los Angeles as a child. She attended the University of California Los Angeles and graduated in 1931 at the age of nineteen. Huettig received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from UCLA and went on to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School from 1930-32, where she studied industrial economics at the Industrial Research Unit under the supervision of Dr. Anne Bezanson. == Career == During 1933-1939, Huettig worked for the Twentieth Century Fund. She then worked on the Motion Picture Research Project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Her work in Hollywood influenced her decision to write a dissertation on the history and industrial development of the American motion picture business. In 1941, she completed her dissertation. Her research was used to analyze the industrial relationships that regulated the film industry and as part of the Paramount Case provided data for litigation that forced studios to divest themselves of theater chains.

The Labour Party lost 3 seats compared to the last election in 2015 but recovered its place as the largest party on the council, having seen its numbers reduced from 23 to 19 over the four years following 2015, while the strength of the Conservative group had been increased by one member in 2019, as a Labour councillor had changed allegiance shortly before the election. In addition to Labour and the Conservatives, the Green Party, which was in minority control from 2011 to 2015, fielded candidates for every seat on the council at this election. Other parties contesting were the Liberal Democrats, the Women's Equality Party (for the first time in the city, with two candidates) and United Kingdom Independence Party, together with a number of independent candidates. Following the election, the Labour minority administration that had governed since 2015 continued in office, however a little over a year later, in July 2020, the Greens regained control of the Council, after the incumbent Labour administration collapsed when three Labour councillors, two of which were accused of antisemitism quit.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- sussex-53496651 == Background and campaigning == The Green Party lost their minority control of the council after the 2015 election, following internal disputes. Labour became the largest party on the council, winning 23 seats. This was reduced in 2017 to 22 after a Labour councillor, Michael Inkpin- Leissner, for Hollingdean and Stanmer became an independent. There have been two council by-elections since the last election: the first in 2016 in the East Brighton ward was won by Lloyd Russell-Moyle, and the second, 18 months later and for the same seat, when Russell-Moyle resigned as a councillor having been elected as MP for Brighton Kemptown. Warren Morgan, Labour leader of the council, resigned from the position in February 2018, some attributing it to internal party conflicts related to the rise of Momentum, a left-wing campaigning group within the Labour Party, who supported many of the candidates selected for seats in the city. In February 2019 Morgan resigned his Labour membership, to form a bloc supporting The Independent Group with Inkpin-Leissner. Anne Meadows, a Labour councillor, defected to the Conservatives, making the Conservatives the largest party on the council. Fifteen councilors were reported to be standing down at this election. Labour published its manifesto in late March, with key policies such as building 800 new council homes over the next four years, making the city carbon neutral by 2030 and auditing outsourced services and bringing them back into council services should they fail in value. Controversy came when a provisional version of the document was leaked to the local media titled the \\"many-fest\\", a 210-page document that brought together ideas from consultation of local labour members. The Green party also posted their manifesto and coordinated their campaigning with Young Greens of England and Wales, who organised their activists from around the country to go to Brighton in April. The Liberal Democrats released a manifesto focusing on five major themes, including housing and homelessness, with a flagship proposal of developing 1,500 new homes on part of the council-owned Hollingbury golf course. The Conservatives announced their proposal to use money in the city council's reserves to fund projects, as well as the establishment of a local lottery programme to invest in sports and cultural facilities. A Conservative candidate standing in the Westbourne ward was forced to resign during the local campaigning period due to him posting islamophobic and other offensive jokes online. A hustings for the elections – which focused on community housing in the city – was hosted on 27 March with councillors from Labour, the Conservatives, the Green party and a Liberal Democrat candidate. ==Results of election== } ==Wards and candidates== Details of the candidates for the 21 wards of the authority were published by the council after nominations closed on 3 April. ===Brunswick and Adelaide=== Brunswick and Adelaide highlighted ===Central Hove=== Central Hove highlighted ===East Brighton=== East Brighton highlighted ===Goldsmid=== Goldsmid highlighted ===Hangleton and Knoll=== Hangleton and Knoll highlighted ===Hanover and Elm Grove=== Hanover and Elm Grove highlighted ===Hollingdean and Stanmer=== Hollingdean and Stanmer highlighted ===Hove Park=== Hove Park highlighted ===Moulsecoomb and Bevendean=== Moulsecoomb and Bevendean highlighted ===North Portslade=== North Portslade highlighted ===Patcham=== Patcham highlighted ===Preston Park=== Preston Park highlighted ===Queen's Park=== Queen's Park highlighted ===Regency=== Regency highlighted ===Rottingdean Coastal=== Rottingdean Coastal highlighted ===South Portslade=== South Portslade highlighted ===St Peter's and North Laine=== St Peter's and North Laine highlighted ===Westbourne=== Westbourne highlighted ===Wish=== Wish highlighted ===Withdean=== Withdean highlighted ===Woodingdean=== Woodingdean highlighted ==See also== * Brighton and Hove City Council elections ==References== Category:2019 English local elections 2019 Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom Category:2010s in East Sussex ","title":"2019 Brighton and Hove City Council election"},{"id":"60415070","text":"Pia Camil (Mexico City, 1980) is a Mexican contemporary artist.

The ward elects councillors to Bridgend Town Council and Bridgend County Borough Council. ==Description== Nolton Street, Bridgend Oldcastle is located immediately south of Bridgend town centre. The area is bordered to the west by the River Ogmore. Oldcastle originally spread along Nolton Street and Cowbridge Road (and was also known as Nolton). The Oldcastle name is believed to refer to Nolton Castle (rather than the nearby Newcastle Castle), whose remains were recorded in the 16th-century on the southeast of a bend in the River Ogmore. With the 'new' castle dating from at least 1106, the 'old' castle is presumed to have been in existence before 1100 and would have been an earth and timber structure. The modern area also includes the Bridgend campus of Bridgend College. ==Electoral ward== The Oldcastle electoral ward extends south to include the areas of Whiterock and Hernston. The ward is bounded by the River Ewenny (and the Vale of Glamorgan) to the south, The Rhiw, Brackla Street and Pen-y-Banc in the north, coterminous with the boundaries of Bridgend town to the east and west. According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 4,799 (with 3,930 aged 18 or over). Oldcastle is one of three wards to Bridgend Town Council (with Morfa and Newcastle), electing up to six of the nineteen Bridgend town councillors. Prior to 1996 Oldcastle was a ward to Ogwr Borough Council, electing two (Conservative) councillors. Oldcastle is also a county ward to Bridgend County Borough Council, electing two county councillors. Since the 1995 elections the ward has generally been represented by the Labour Party, though had Liberal Democrat representation between 2004 and 2012.

He taught at Rush Medical College in Chicago for almost 50 years, and was acclaimed for his teaching. With Frederick Peterson, he published a comprehensive guide to medicine and the law, A Textbook on Legal Medicine and Toxicology, which went through many editions. An early forensic scientist, Haines testified in a number of sensational trials, including those relating to the Haymarket bombing of 1886, the disappearance of Adolph Luetgert's second wife Louisa in 1897, and the suspicious deaths in multimillionaire Thomas Hunton Swope's family in 1909. ==Early life and education== Walter Stanley Haines was born September 27, 1850, to John Charles Haines and Emma Adams (Fay) Haines of Chicago. His father was an ardent abolitionist and held the position of mayor of Chicago for two terms (1858–1860). Walter was one of four children. He graduated from Chicago High School in 1869, ranking first in his class. Walter Haines attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology for two years, 1869–1871, but returned to Chicago as a result of illness. Changing his major from chemistry to medicine, he earned a medical degree from Chicago Medical College in 1873. Before graduating, he was offered the position of professor of chemistry at Chicago Medical College, which he held from 1872 to 1876. He interned at Mercy Hospital in Chicago and also visited France to study at the Sorbonne in Paris. ==Career== In 1876, at age 26, Walter Haines was offered a professorship in chemistry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, which he accepted. Haines spent nearly fifty years there, teaching chemistry, materia medica, and toxicology. He was acclaimed for both the quality of his teaching and his kind and sympathetic manner: With Frederick Peterson, Haines published A Textbook on Legal Medicine and Toxicology, a comprehensive guide to medicine and the law. Haine's contributions included a chapter on \\"General Principles of Toxicology\\", which described common poisons, their symptoms and treatment, and best practices for postmortem examinations. The textbook first appeared in two volumes in 1903–1904 and went through multiple editions. Haines was recognized as an authority in chemistry. He was a member of the American Chemical Society, the American Medical Association, and the Chemical Society of London, among others. He served on the Committee on Revision of the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an official national reference book for pharmaceutical standards and practice, from 1900 to 1920. He also served on the Illinois State Food Standard Commission; and the Illinois Commission on Industrial Diseases. In 1916, Rush Medical College was presented with a portrait of Haines, painted by Arvid Nyholm. In 1922, the Alumni Association recognized Haines' long teaching career by presenting him with a gold watch and announced that they planned to establish a Walter S. Haines Fund for the library of Rush Medical College. Haines continued to teach until his death on January 27, 1923, at Presbyterian Hospital, Chicago, Illinois. His death was attributed to bronchiectasis and chronic nephritis. ==Forensics and criminology== Haines was a pioneer in adapting medical techniques from the laboratory for application to forensics investigations and the presentation of courtroom evidence. In this capacity he was called upon to testify in both civil and criminal trials, including a number of sensational cases. His cases involved a variety of different experimental techniques for examining evidence and testing possible forensic scenarios. === Haymarket bombing === Haines testified on July 30, 1886 at the trial of the men accused of the Haymarket bombing. He discussed fragments of the exploded bombs, the only physical evidence to be presented at the trial, and their similarity to materials found in the possession of one of the defendants. He and chemist Mark Delafontaine analyzed several samples of bomb fragments, including fragments from the bodies of Officer Mathias Degan, who died in the explosion, and Officer Murphy who survived. Other materials came from intact bombs found in the apartment of defendant Louis Lingg. The prosecution argued that defendant August Spies also had access to explosives. The question facing Haines and Delafontaine was whether the materials from the exploded bomb were similar in terms of their chemical composition to the materials in the defendant's possession. Anyone who was party to the plan could be held responsible for its consequences under Illinois law if it could be shown that the bombing was premeditated–which was murder in the Haymarket case. Haines testified that the unexploded bombs confiscated by the police were similar in composition to the explosion fragments. The samples mainly contained lead, but also included small amounts of tin and traces of antimony and zinc. One sample also contained trace amounts of copper, though the trace elements were considered insignificant. The fragments that struck the two officers were similar. They did not perfectly match the samples from the unexploded bombs, but Haines suggested that they were made by similar processes involving melting lead and other metals, then casting it in clay molds to form a bomb casing. Haines argued that commercial lead samples did not include tin and suggested that the exploded and unexploded bombs had been made from a consistent \\"recipe\\". The prosecutors could not prove that any of the eight defendants threw the bomb, but they convicted them nonetheless. Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a blasting cap, smuggled inside a cigar. August Spies, George Engel, Albert Parsons, and Adolph Fischer were hanged. The other defendants had their sentences commuted. === Disappearance of Louisa Luetgert === Adolph Luetgert, nicknamed \\"the sausage king of Chicago\\", was accused in 1897 of the murder of his second wife Louisa Bicknese Luetgert. She had reportedly gone missing as of May 1, 1897. Police suspected Luetgert of killing Louisa at the A.L. Luetgert Sausage & Packing Company, dissolving her body in the plant and burning whatever remained in a furnace. Police searched the factory, finding bone fragments and a couple of rings, one marked \\"L.L.\\" Haines testified that the remains found by the police were physically consistent with the suspected method of disposing of Louisa's body. Haines reported that he had tested this by boiling down three cadavers in solutions of potash, a substance that Luetgert had purchased prior to Louisa's disappearance. The resultant remains were similar to those found in the sausage factory. The court determined that Louisa Luetgert was dead and convicted Adolph Luetgert of her murder. === Deaths in the Thomas Hunton Swope family === In late 1909, several deaths occurred in the home of Thomas Hunton Swope, a Kansas City bachelor who had become a multimillionaire in real estate. He lived with his widowed sister-in-law Margaret Swope in her 26-room mansion, as did a number of her children and other extended family members. Margaret's daughter Frances and her husband Dr. Bennett Clark Hyde also lived nearby, though not in the same house. Frances had married Dr. Hyde on June 21, 1905 in spite of strong opposition from her mother. By 1909, however, mother and daughter had reconciled, and Thomas Hunton Swope had given the couple a home of their own. The first person in the Swope household to die was James Moss Hunton, a cousin of Margaret Swope's late husband Logan; he had lived with the family before and after Logan's death. He was a banker, and he managed Logan's estate and was the executor for Thomas Hunton Swope's will. He and Swope had recently been discussing the possibility of changes to the will; Swope was considering giving more of his huge fortune to charity, which would leave less of it to divide among his surviving family. On October 1, 1909, Hunton was taken suddenly and violently ill. He was apparently suffering from a cerebral hemorrhage, and a standard practice of the time was blood-letting to remove pressure on the brain. Bennett Clark Hyde carried out the blood- letting and insisted on bleeding him heavily, in spite of objections from nurse Pearl Kellar and Dr. George Twyman. Hunton died. Thomas Hunton Swope died on October 3 after a short illness and before any changes could be made to his will. Hyde was involved again, and his medical treatment was considered questionable. He gave Swope's nurse an unidentified capsule \\"to improve his digestion\\", and Swope went into convulsions some 20 minutes later. His legs were stiff, his jaw was clenched, and his heart was racing. Hyde's treatment was to give Swope repeated injections of strychnine, which was sometimes used when the heart needed stimulation. Swope died within a few hours. On Thanksgiving, November 25, 1909, the remaining members of the Swope and Hyde families ate Thanksgiving dinner at the Swope home. Within a week, nine of the Swopes were stricken with typhoid fever. The Hydes did not become ill, possibly because they had brought bottled water to drink that Thanksgiving. Frances' brother William Chrisman Swope seemed to be improving until Hyde gave him a capsule. He began convulsing, was given strychnine by Hyde, and died on December 6, 1909. Hyde diagnosed the fatal illness as meningitis. Frances and William's sister Margaret also took a pill at Hyde's instruction and went into convulsions, but she recovered with treatment from Dr. George Twyman. James Moss Hunton, Thomas Hunton Swope, and William Chrisman Swope had all died after questionable treatment by Bennett Clark Hyde. Suspicions mounted, and investigators linked Hyde to the purchase of cyanide capsules and typhoid cultures. Coroner Ludvig Hektoen ordered Walter Haines to perform autopsies on William Chrisman Swope (December 30, 1909) and Thomas Hunton Swope (January 12, 1910). Haines reported that Thomas Hunton Swope's body contained lethal amounts of strychnine and cyanide. Hyde was tried and convicted of the murder of Thomas Swope on May 16, 1910. Hyde appealed the decision, and the Missouri Supreme Court overturned the verdict on procedural grounds on April 11, 1911 and called for a retrial. Hyde's wife Frances supported him through extensive court proceedings, which included at least two mistrials, one possible bribery attempt, and additional litigation over who would pay the cost of the prosecution. The State of Missouri and Margaret Swope are estimated to have spent $250,000 pursuing Hyde's conviction, but the charges were dropped on April 9, 1917 and he was released. In 1920, Frances divorced Hyde on charges that he was threatening and abusive, but she continued to maintain that he was innocent of murder. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== * Category:1850 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Disease-related deaths in Illinois Category:Feinberg School of Medicine alumni Category:Forensic scientists Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:Physicians from Illinois Category:Rush Medical College faculty Category:Scientists from Chicago ","title":"Walter Stanley Haines"},{"id":"60415118","text":"Dennis James Sorrell (7 October 1940 – 10 November 2019) was an English professional footballer who played as a left-half in the Football League for Leyton Orient and Chelsea.

The fountain, built in 1812, was connected to the first aqueduct of the Elector Palatine. ==History== Jean Marie Thérèse Doazan, the prefect of the French department of Rhin-et-Moselle, built the neo-classical fountain made of basalt blocks in 1812 in front of the basilica. His hastily written inscription, inscribed in orthographically incorrect French, was intended to commemorate Napoleon's supposedly successful campaign in Russia. The text says: (that is: In 1812 / Memorial to the campaign against the Russians / under the prefecture of Jules Doazan.) In fact, Napoleon's campaign in Russia ended in catastrophic defeat. In the War of the Sixth Coalition on New Year's Eve of 1814, the predominantly Russian Army Corps under General Saint-Priest, which formed the right wing of Blücher's Silesian Army, crossed the Rhine between Neuwied and the Lahn estuary with the main focus on Koblenz. The French had recently vacated the city and left it to the Russians without a fight. Saint-Priest, however, showed humor and did not remove Doazan's fountain or the first inscription, but put a second one underneath. It is: (that is: Seen and approved by us, Russian commander of the city Koblenz, on 1 January 1814.) ==Construction== The Kastorbrunnen is a large square of Niedermendig basalt cubes, and was originally in the middle of the square. It was created to the plans of the military engineer Dagobert Chauchet by the sculptor Rauch from Aachen, and has a high, grooved base and a wide grooved end plate. There are two suspended semicircular fountain shells from Lahn marble attached. The well was fed with spring water piped from Metternich and, since 15 August 1812 (the birthday of the emperor Napoleon) has supplied the neighborhood with clean drinking water. It supported a group of figures made of limestone with the personifications of the Rhine and Moselle. Because of severe weathering the sculpture was removed shortly after 1817. A copy is now in the garden of the Electoral Palace. In the 1950s the fountain, which the French had placed on the axis of the Kastorgasse, and thus in the line of sight of the basilica, was moved a few meters to the north to clear the view of the church. ==Protection== The Kastorbrunnen is a protected cultural monument, and is registered in the list of monuments of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is located in Koblenz-Altstadt at the Kastorhof. Since 2002 Kastorbrunnen has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Upper Middle Rhine Valley. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Koblenz Category:Fountains in Germany Category:French invasion of Russia Category:History of Koblenz Category:Limestone sculptures Category:Marble sculptures in Germany Category:Stone sculptures in Germany ","title":"Kastorbrunnen"},{"id":"60415163","text":"Irena Maria Lichnerowicz-Augustyn (born 16 May 1974, Brodnica) is a Polish diplomat who serves an ambassador of Poland to Cyprus since 5 September 2018. == Life == Irena Lichnerowicz-Augustyn has graduated from the English studies at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

The interpolant takes the form of a weighted sum of radial basis functions. RBF interpolation is a mesh-free method, meaning the nodes (points in the domain) need not lie on a structured grid, and does not require the formation of a mesh. It is often spectrally accurate and stable for large numbers of nodes even in high dimensions. Many interpolation methods can be used as the theoretical foundation of algorithms for approximating linear operators, and RBF interpolation is no exception. RBF interpolation has been used to approximate differential operators, integral operators, and surface differential operators. These algorithms have been used to find highly accurate solutions of many differential equations including Navier–Stokes equations, Cahn–Hilliard equation, and the shallow water equations. ==Examples== Let f(x) = \\\\exp(x \\\\cos(3 \\\\pi x)) and let x_k = \\\\frac{k}{14}, k=0, 1, \\\\dots, 14 be 15 equally spaced points on the interval [0, 1]. We will form s(x) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=0}^{14} w_k \\\\varphi(\\\\x-x_k\\\\) where \\\\varphi is a radial basis function, and choose w_k, k=0, 1, \\\\dots, 14 such that s(x_k)=f(x_k), k=0, 1, \\\\dots, 14 (s interpolates f at the chosen points). In matrix notation this can be written as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\varphi(\\\\x_0 - x_0\\\\) & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_1 - x_0\\\\) & \\\\dots & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_{14} - x_0\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi(\\\\x_0 - x_1\\\\) & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_1 - x_1\\\\) & \\\\dots & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_{14} - x_{1}\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi(\\\\x_0 - x_{14}\\\\) & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_1 - x_{14}\\\\) & \\\\dots & \\\\varphi(\\\\x_{14} - x_{14}\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix}w_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ w_{14}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}f(x_0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(x_1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(x_{14})\\\\end{bmatrix}. Choosing \\\\varphi(r) = \\\\exp(-(\\\\varepsilon r)^2), the Gaussian, with a shape parameter of \\\\varepsilon = 3, we can then solve the matrix equation for the weights and plot the interpolant. Plotting the interpolating function below, we see that it is visually the same everywhere except near the left boundary (an example of Runge's phenomenon), where it is still a very close approximation. More precisely the maximum error is roughly \\\\f - s\\\\_\\\\infty \\\\approx 0.0267414 at x = 0.0220012. ==Motivation== The Mairhuber–Curtis theorem says that for any open set V in \\\\mathbb{R}^n with n \\\\geq 2, and f_1, f_2, \\\\dots, f_n linearly independent functions on V, there exists a set of n points in the domain such that the interpolation matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1) & f_2(x_1) & \\\\dots & f_n(x_1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_1(x_2) & f_2(x_2) & \\\\dots & f_n(x_2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_1(x_n) & f_2(x_n) & \\\\dots & f_n(x_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} is singular. This means that if one wishes to have a general interpolation algorithm, one must choose the basis functions to depend on the interpolation points. In 1971, Rolland Hardy developed a method of interpolating scattered data using interpolants of the form s(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^N \\\\sqrt{\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_k\\\\^2 + C}. This is interpolation using a basis of shifted multiquadric functions, now more commonly written as \\\\varphi(r) = \\\\sqrt{1+(\\\\varepsilon r)^2}, and is the first instance of radial basis function interpolation. It has been shown that the resulting interpolation matrix will always be non-singular. This does not violate the Mairhuber–Curtis theorem since the basis functions depend on the points of interpolation. Choosing a radial kernel such that the interpolation matrix is non-singular is exactly the definition of a radial basis function. It has been shown that any function that is completely monotone will have this property, including the Gaussian, inverse quadratic, and inverse multiquadric functions. == Shape-parameter tuning == Many radial basis functions have a parameter that controls their relative flatness or peakedness. This parameter is usually represented by the symbol \\\\varepsilon with the function becoming increasingly flat as \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0. For example, Rolland Hardy used the formula \\\\varphi(r) = \\\\sqrt{r^2 + C} for the multiquadric, however nowadays the formula \\\\varphi(r) = \\\\sqrt{1 + (\\\\varepsilon r)^2} is used instead. These formulas are equivalent up to a scale factor. This factor is inconsequential since the basis vectors have the same span and the interpolation weights will compensate. By convention, the basis function is scaled such that \\\\varphi(0) = 1 as seen in the plots of the Gaussian functions and the bump functions. File:Gaussian function shape parameter.pngA Gaussian function for several choices of \\\\varepsilon File:Bump function shape.pngA plot of the scaled bump function with several choices of shape parameter bed-of-nails interpolant.\\" A consequence of this choice, is that the interpolation matrix approaches the identity matrix as \\\\varepsilon \\\\to \\\\infty leading to stability when solving the matrix system. The resulting interpolant will in general be a poor approximation to the function since it will be near zero everywhere, except near the interpolation points where it will sharply peak the so-called \\"bed- of-nails interpolant\\" (as seen in the plot to the right). A plot of the condition number by the shape parameter for a 15x15 radial basis function interpolation matrix using the Gaussian On the opposite side of the spectrum, the condition number of the interpolation matrix will diverge to infinity as \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0 leading to ill-conditioning of the system. In practice, one chooses a shape parameter so that the interpolation matrix is \\"on the edge of ill-conditioning\\" (eg. with a condition number of roughly 10^{12} for double- precision floating point). There are sometimes other factors to consider when choosing a shape-parameter. For example the bump function \\\\varphi(r) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{1 - (\\\\varepsilon r)^2}\\\\right) & \\\\mbox{ for } r<\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{ otherwise} \\\\end{cases} has a compact support (it is zero everywhere except when r< \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\varepsilon}) leading to a sparse interpolation matrix. Some radial basis functions such as the polyharmonic splines have no shape-parameter. == References == Category:Numerical analysis Category:Approximation theory Category:Interpolation ","title":"Radial basis function interpolation"},{"id":"60415317","text":"Andychristyite is a lead copper tellurate mineral with the chemical formula PbCuTeOHO.

Hrycyna is a Professor of Biochemistry at Purdue University. She studies multi-drug resistance in human cancer, which usually occurs due to over expression of the MDR1 gene. == Early life and education == Hrycyna studied at Middlebury College and graduated in 1988. She was a postgraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and earned her doctorate in 1993. She worked in Steven Clarke's laboratory on protein modifications. Hrycyna was a postdoctoral fellow at The Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research and the National Cancer Institute. == Research and career == Hrycyna works at Purdue University, which she joined as an Assistant Professor in 2000. Multidrug resistance cancer often arrises due to over expression of an energy-dependent multi-drug efflux pump, the multi-drug transporter P-glycoprotein. Whilst it is understood that P-glycoproteins are important in the movement of pharmalogical agents, their mechanism as a drug efflux pump is unclear. She looked at the mechanism of the efflux pump and how it functions in normal and cancerous cells. P-glycoproteins can be recognised by several different substrates, but their affinity is reduced during a catalytic transfer state. The MDR1 gene results in expression of a P-glycoprotein and related drug transporter MXR1, which are involved in mitoxantrone resistance. She found that amino acid 483, which is present in MXR/BCRP/ABCP gene, changes when the gene is over-expressed. Unfortunately, cancers treated with a variety of anti-cancer drugs can develop resistance to other cytotoxic agents. Drug transporters like MXR1 and P-glycoprotein are part of the ATP-binding cassette transporter group. Hrycyna studies the cellular function of ABC-transporters and how they have impact human disease. She has worked on new drugs for the treatment of HIV, which work by blocking the action of ZMPSTE24. Hrycyna studies the post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins, including the small G proteins. Eukaryotic proteins undergo three modifications, including isoprenylation, proteolysis and methylesterification, and are synthesised with the C-terminal sequence Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa. In 2011 Hrycyna wrote the book Protein Prenylation. === Academic service === Hrycyna has been awarded the Purdue University Department of Chemistry Arthur E.

Victorian cosmetics were often toxic or otherwise damaging. Commonly used products included ingredients such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and ammonia. Many cosmetic products were aimed at achieving as pale a complexion as possible, as this would indicate a woman did not have to work outside, and was thus of high status. The two main styles were \\"natural\\", which conveyed that a woman was of good morals, and \\"painted\\", which was seen as somewhat provocative.Zarrelli, Natalie. \\"The Poisonous Beauty Advice Columns of Victorian England,\\" Atlas Obscura, December 15, 2015. ==Skin== The use of excessive makeup in the Victorian age was viewed as promiscuous and would only be seen on performers or prostitutes.Marsh, Medeleine. Compacts and Cosmetics: Beauty from Victorian Times to the Present Day. Havertown: Remember When, 2009. Internet resource. A pure, natural face, free from blemishes, freckles, or marks was considered beautiful. However, that didn't mean woman did not secretly concoct their own remedies and cosmetics to enhance features and hide imperfections. Societal women did not want it known that they wore cosmetics so their beauty rituals were not publicized or discussed. One of the most important features to a woman in the Victorian Era was to have the most translucent, pale complexion possible.Beerbohm, Max. A Defence of Cosmetics. New York: Dodd, Mead and Co, 1922. Print. A fair and healthy complexion distinguished a woman's social status. A lady of a higher social standing would use accessories like gloves and umbrellas to help protect her from the environment. Cold cream - consisting of water, oil, emulsifier, and thickening agent - became a staple in the beauty rituals of Victorian women. It was believed that cold cream is beneficial for cleansing the skin and providing a moisturizing effect, and so the cream was essential to Victorian women who wanted to maintain very soft, delicate skin. It was one of the only products in the Victorian era that was fairly safe to use and not looked down upon. The invention of cold cream goes back to antiquity. Women who employed the \\"painted\\" look used white paints and enamels on their faces and arms. This would mean avoiding exaggerated facial expressions, because the substances would crack. These substances were also corrosive to the skin because they contained lead, mercury, and arsenic so women would have to keep applying them to cover the damage.Zarrelli, Natalie. \\"The Poisonous Beauty Advice Columns of Victorian England,\\" Atlas Obscura, December 15, 2015. == Cheeks and Lips == Rouge was used to help add color to cheeks and lips. While women were discouraged from wearing makeup, women found ways to improve their complexion with rouge. Natural ingredients, such as strawberries or herbs, were seen as providing a suitable colour, and thus preferred. Lip rouge was made from multiple ingredients such as animal fat, beet root, herbs, beetles and almonds, to produce a pink or red hue. ==Eyes== Watery eyes were considered attractive because (paired with pale skin) they were associated with tuberculosis. To achieve this, women put drops of perfume, citrus, or belladonna in their eyes - the latter an ingredient which would cause blindness if used for long enough. Mercury was used to make eyebrows and eyelashes less sparse.Zarrelli, Natalie. \\"The Poisonous Beauty Advice Columns of Victorian England,\\" Atlas Obscura, December 15, 2015. ==Hair== link=File:Edwards'_%22Harlene%22_for_the_hair_Wellcome_L0031645.jpg High society Victorian woman went for natural beauty in regards to cosmetics to appear pure and youthful however there was a need for hair treatments and products that sustained intricate hairstyles. For many cultures woman’s hair is an expression of their femininity, and Victorian women were of no exception. Many nineteenth-century photographs show women with extremely long hair. The length of the hair, in particular, was a display of a women's health and was well taken care of. Both men and women used products to promote hair growth. Since the use of cosmetics on societal women was limited, hair was kept well groomed. Victorian women would braid their hair, use hair wigs and apply heat to make tight curls. The Victorian era was a period in which it was more possible for women to focus on personal hygiene than it was in previous generations.Goodman, Ruth. How to Be a Victorian: A Dawn-to-Dusk Guide to Victorian Life. , 2014. Print. == Perfume == Natural scents were considered to be appropriate, while more overwhelming smells were associated with promiscuity. Queen Victoria considered floral scents to be the most appropriate for women to wear. Perfumes used included different types of floral such as lavender, violets, rose, and other citrus scents - the most popular apparently being violets - as well as infused herbs such as rosemary to help enhance the scents. Perfume was typically used on clothing, hair and handkerchiefs as opposed to on the skin. ==References== Category:Cosmetics Cosmetics ","title":"Victorian-era cosmetics"},{"id":"60415510","text":"King Faisal Hospital, Kigali was established between 1987 and 1991 with the help of the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD).

Steveni was the co-founder and director of the Artist Placement Group (APG), which ran from the 1960s to the 1990s. The APG's goal was to refocus art outside galleries and museums. It instead installed artists in industrial and government organizations to both learn about and to have a voice in these worlds and then, where possible, organize exhibitions of work related to those experiences. Its work was a key precursor of the now widely-applied artist in residency concept. == Early Life and education == Steveni was born in Iran in 1928 to British parents. Steveni's father worked in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and her early life was spent moving back and forth between Iran and Devon, where she lived with her grandparents from the age of five. Steveni had an unconventional education, attending a dance school in Teignmouth during the Second World War, but nonetheless managed to obtain her School Certificate and proceeded to win a place at the Chelsea College of Art. In 1951, Steveni married the artist John Latham, who she would go on to work with on the Artist Placement Group. == Career == Steveni initially worked in Performance art and engaged with the shift towards Conceptual art. She participated in Fluxus networks in the late 1950s and 1960s and created Happenings and assemblage sculptures. In 1965 Steveni had the idea to found the Artist Placement Group (APG), inspired by an invitation from Frank Martin at the St Martin's School of Art for her to give a lecture to students on the role of the artist in society. Working in collaboration with Latham, Steveni formally launched the APG in 1966. Latham and Steveni were joined by artists including Jeffrey Shaw, Stuart Brisley, David Hall and Barry Flanagan. As well as securing support from Martin, Steveni also made contact with the industrialist Sir Robert Adeane, who acted as a chairman for many companies, and encouraged Steveni to put her concept into action. APG aimed to partner artists in private companies and public bodies, in order to fight the isolation of the artist from wider society. In 1968, Steveni approached the chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain with a proposal to use the Hayward Gallery for an exhibition. This was realised in 1971 with the exhibition Art and Economics. Steveni set up the first placement secured by the organisation between Garth Evans and the British Steel Corporation in 1969. Other artists who had important placements with APG included Keith Arnatt, Ian Breakwell, Stuart Brisley, George Levantis and David Hall. In the 1980s, feeling that the notion of the artist placement had been appropriated and diluted by many arts and academic organisations, Steveni and Latham changed the name of APG to O+I or Organisation & Imagination. Throughout the APG's operation, Steveni played a fundamental directorial role in its administration and running, making connections between artists and industry, securing funding and arranging payments. Steveni's extensive managerial role has, however, often been obscured within histories of the APG, and the historical focus has mainly been on the work of Latham. As Victoria Lane writes: 'Her pivotal role within the development of APG has generally been obscured by the better-known work of John Latham and the theoretical approach he brought to the group, combined with the domination of the male artists in APG.' In 2002 Steveni began the project I Am An Archive, described as an 'ongoing performative archive project' through which the artist reflects on her involvement in APG. It includes artists walks and conversations, which are actively documented. In 2005, Steveni was in conversation with Tony Benn about the APG - the politician was an early and important supporter of the organization- at Tate Archive, which now holds the APG papers and records. During 2008, Steveni participated in the Manifesto Marathon at the Serpentine Gallery. In 2009-10 Steveni exhibited documentation from I Am An Archive at the Arnolfini gallery as part of her installation and enactment Beyond the Acid Free. == References == Category:1928 births Category:2020 deaths Category:British artists Category:British women artists Category:Conceptual artists Category:Artists from London ","title":"Barbara Steveni"},{"id":"60415541","text":"South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR or SAIMAR, pronounced ) is the name of a shadowy paramilitary organization that supposedly performed clandestine operations to support white supremacy in Africa. The SAIMR first became publicly known during sessions of the South African Truth and Reconcilliation Committee (TRC), in 1998, a year before the second elections after Apartheid, when documents emerged implying SAIMR had a role in a plot to kill Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN Secretary-General, in 1961. Letters with SAIMR’s official letterhead were found during the hearings of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998. The letters suggested that CIA and British intelligence had agreed that Hammarskjöld should be removed, a suggestion both the United States and Britain deny. The documentary Cold Case Hammarskjöld, that premiered in January 2019, brought new credibility to these claims. The documentary also claims that the mother of a young woman named Dagmar Feil tried to bring the killing of her daughter to the attention of the TRC, implying that her daughter had worked with SAIMR to spread HIV among black people and had wanted to make that public. == References == Category:South Africa articles needing attention ","title":"South African Institute for Maritime Research"},{"id":"60415553","text":"\\"Unforgiven\\" is a song by American alternative metal band Sevendust.

It is believed by East Asian cultures, like other turtles in mythology, to represent longevity (). It is said to be chief among all shelled creatures. ==Identification== Among the Four Intelligent Beasts (), a list of auspicious animals, the turtle goes by several names. Although it can simply be called \\"turtle\\" ( guī), it is also referred to as \\"old turtle\\" ( lǎoguī) and \\"spirit turtle\\" ( língguī). The latter is sometimes understood as being synonymous with \\"divine turtle\\" ( shénguī) although distinctions are made. The term is also used in reference to the turtle shells used in traditional divination. ==China== Zhang-Gui-Shen-gui-tu The Erya provides entries on the terms \\"divine turtle\\" () and \\"spirit turtle\\" (). The former term includes an annotation which simply reads \\"the most sacred of turtles\\" (). According to the Shuyiji ( Tales of Strange Matters) compiled by Ren Fang, a turtle that has lived for one thousand years has grown hair, a five thousand year old tortoise is called a \\"divine turtle\\" () and an animal older than ten thousand years is called a \\"spiritual turtle\\" (). The Baopuzi gives a slightly different account, describing the spirit turtle as one thousand years old. While the theme of longevity persists, the age at which the creature is recognized as a \\"spirit turtle\\" () is in stark contrast with the account found in the Shuyiji. The text continues to describe the turtle as having five colors: blue, red, yellow, white, and black; together representing the five elements. ==Japan== In Japanese mythology, the creature is identified as the Reiki ( \\"spirit turtle\\"). The Zenrin-kushū provides a kōan that reads Reiki o o hiku ( \\"The spirit turtle sweeps its tail\\"). It is described as a variant of the phrase Ato o haratte ato shōzu ( \\"Erasing traces creates traces\\"). The spirit turtle is an endemic motif at Shintō shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan. The sangō title \\"Reigizan\\" ( \\"Spirit Turtle Mountain\\") belongs to several temples across the country, including Tenryū-ji and Rinsen- ji in Kyōto, Hontoku-ji in Himeji, Daichō-ji in Uwajima, and others. It is said the Kameoka Hachimangū shrine at Sendai is so-called because a spirit turtle appeared at the time of its construction. Stone statues of the creature can be found at Zenyōmitsu-ji and Kameoka Hachimangū in Mashiko, Tochigi.

Non-neural cognition can manifest as cell memory, neurotransmitter signaling, or bioelectric communication and organization, and it is present in many organisms, from single-celled to humans. == Cognition in slime molds == Evidence for cognition occurring outside of the brain can be seen in slime molds. For example, if Physarum polycephalum is placed in a maze that contains a reward at the end, it will grow in such a way that it will reach the reward, creating a continuous connection between the beginning and ending of the maze. The mold was able to compute the most optimal path, engage in coordinated movement, and redirect resources for cellular growth in the direction of a desired reward. == Bioelectrical pattern recognition == Bioelectrical pattern recognition is one form of non-neural cognition. Planarians are able to regenerate severed bodies – when cut just behind the head, a new body will grow from the severed head, and a new head will grow from the body segment, resulting in two separate flatworms. The flatworm cells are able to determine the specific components of the regeneration through a change in bioelectrical signaling. There are high levels of bioelectrical activity closest to the head while the lowest levels occur at the furthest point from the head. If the voltage- gradient is disturbed upon severing the head from the body by increasing the voltage of both ends of the Planarian, the resulting flatworm will have two heads. Interestingly, future Planaria cut from the two-headed variant will also have two heads. However, editing the bioelectric pattern does not affect the anatomy of the current flatworm. So, the particular bioelectric pattern does not encode for the physical state of the current planarian, but rather for all future states, a phenomenon known as latent pattern memory. == References == Category:Cell communication Category:Cognitive neuroscience ","title":"Non-neural cognition"},{"id":"60415638","text":"Antipinite is a rare alkali copper oxalate mineral with the chemical formula KNaCu(CO).

Her parents were Antonio da Silveira Xando and Petonilha Nogueira Xando. Niobe lived most of her childhood in the interior of São Paulo by the countryside, but moved to the capital in 1932. At the age of sixteen she married a prominent communist militant, Joao Baptista Ribeiro Rosa. When she moved into the city, Niobe began attending the Communist Party meetings and met many many of the left-wing intellectuals and politicians of that time. In 1951, Niobe separated from her first husband and married Alexander Bloch, a Czech intellectual and scholar. Her husband had a vast culture that led to friendships with other intellectuals, one of whom was Vilem Flusser. Flusser wrote about Niobe's artwork in three articles, two of which were published in the arts newspaper. Through 1968–1971, Niobe and Alexander moved throughout Europe passing through Paris, London, and Stockholm. During this period, a music label in London asked Alexander Bloch for permission to use one of Niobe's works to illustrate the Rolling Stones album. The project fell through because Niobe had a quiet approach in her art and life. She settled in New York for six months in 1981 and 1983, after which she returned to Brazil in 1983. Niobe last works were from 1999, in large part due to her numerous health problems. She died in 2010. ==Artworks== Niobe transitioned through many styles of art throughout her career. Her art included figuratism, transitional works, flowers, masks, letterism, mechanism, abstractions, collages, reprography, and objects. In the 1950s, Niobe began her career as a figurative painter. She would paint childlike scenes, games, small local bars, and self portraits. She also began her paintings on tree trunks that was avant-garde at her time because it stepped out of the traditional paper. She abandoned figurativism in the later 1950s and began to embrace mythology that depicted mutating beings. Her masks were also predecessors of the surrealistic art that was inspired by ancestral cultures. Niobe began to create original and extravagant pieces using washers, rulers, compasses, and other unusual objects. This type of art was a movement called Mechanismo in which she approached a clash between archaic and contemporary art. It also demonstrated the conflict between humankind and machines. At the end of 1960, Niobe established a base for a new artistic manifesto that led to her letrismo. Letrismo was the break between the words and communication. Her last few works had returned to figurative paintings. ===Flores Fantásticas=== -Fantastic Flowers, 1963 -Oil on Canvas -The flowers highly contrasted the old traditional flower paintings. It demonstrated the Pre-Columbian style by her use of the colors and ornamental arrangement. The art gives the impression that Niobe used a magnifying glass to enlarge certain aspects of the leaves and flowers. The amplified details depict unimaginable creatures from other dimensions. Niobe recalled the tropical nature of her childhood and devoted to the creation of strange flowerings. ===Máscaras=== -Masks, 1969 -Oil on Board -Niobe entered her phase influenced by African, Aboriginal, and Pre-Columbian masks. Some masks appear out of plants as it is within Afro-Brazilian cults that manifest the orixás, higher beings of nature. The masks carry enigmatic images of ancient gods of her country, and are inspired by her ancestors to create graphic sings to represent symbols. They help express a historical development of her country, while accepting different cultures. ===Joia-Objeto de Maryvonne Dubois=== Maryvonne Dubois's Jewellery Piece -Mechanismo -Silver and Diamond -Niobe confronts her country's traditional religious affiliations by using the modern mechanical constructions.

Myrick. After a developmental reading at the 2015 New York Musical Theatre Festival where it won the “Award for Excellence,” the show has been presented at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center National Music Theater Conference, the Johnny Mercer Writers Colony at Goodspeed Musicals, and the New Works Festival at TheatreWorks Silicon Valley. The musical was formerly titled iLLA! A Hip Hop Musical. == Overview == A high school classically ballet trained dancer dreams of becoming a hip hop star. With pressures to succeed mounting, he adopts a dangerous persona to get closer to fortune, fame and win an open mic battle to gain respect and find his authentic voice. == Production history == === 2015 === Once Upon a Rhyme: A Musical Tale, formerly known as iLLA! A Hip Hop Musical, began development in 2015. Originally slated to be a one-man show and album inspired by Ronvé O’Daniel’s real life experiences, it quickly evolved into a full-fledged musical with the changing scope of the story. In 2015, an IndieGoGo campaign was created to fund a production of the musical. It finished with 127% of its goal funded, and funds went toward the show’s July 20th premiere at the New York Musical Theatre Festival, where it won the NYMF Developmental Reading Series’ “Award for Excellence”. === 2016 === In February 2016, iLLA! underwent a weeklong workshop at the Toledo School for the Arts. This workshop culminated in three staged readings on February 5th and 6th, 2016 at the Toledo School for the Arts Attic Theatre. Development continued in June 2016, when iLLA! was workshopped in Atlanta at the Cobb Center for Excellence in the Performing Arts for over three weeks. Five workshop performances were held on June 10th and 12th. The show returned for NYMF’s 2016 Festival to be workshopped with a concert version as part of the Next Link Project performed on July 29th, July 31st, and August 2nd, 2016, where it won NYMF’s “Best of Fest” award. Following NYMF, musical selections were performed at Joe’s Pub at The Public Theater in November 2016. === 2017 === Songs from iLLA! were performed for the New York Musical Theatre Festival in June 2017, as part of an Underground Fundraiser held by NYMF at SubCulture. In July 2017, developmental readings were held at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center’s National Music Theater Conference, where Ronvé took home the “Georgia Bogardus Holof Lyricist Award.” === 2018 === Development continued in January 2018 when Ronvé O’Daniel and Jevares Myrick were selected for the 2018 Johnny Mercer Writers Colony at Goodspeed Musicals. iLLA! was further developed during the four-week think tank for musical theater writers. The musical was renamed Once Upon a Rhyme and received a two week dance lab at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, choreographed by Stephanie Klemons in Spring 2018. In August 2018, this new version of the show presented three staged readings as a part of TheatreWorks Silicon Valley’s 2018 New Works Festival.

The Young's Jersey Dairy company began in 1946. Beginning in the 1950s, the family began selling milk from their dairy operations, expanding to cheese and some food items such as sandwiches and hot dogs in the 1960s. They started selling ice cream in 1981, for which they are best known today. In 2019, the farm celebrated its 150th anniversary, for which Ohio governor Mike DeWine presented the business with a proclamation. ==Visitor attractions== Young's Jersey Dairy has several visitor attractions outside the scope of a typical dairy farm, including batting cages and miniature golf. The farm also has a petting zoo where visitors can interact with cows, goats, and pigs. They also have fall seasonal activities such as a corn maze, pumpkin picking, and wagon rides, as well as winter seasonal activities like allowing guests to cut their own Christmas trees. ==Production and statistics== Young's Jersey Dairy produces about of ice cream per year and approximately of cheese. Half of all their cheese produced is sold as cheese curds. They maintain a herd of approximately 30 Jersey cows; the milk from the cows is used to produce their cheese. The milk used to make their ice cream is purchased from Reiter Dairy. The property has a black walnut tree plantation of around 10,000 trees as well as a plantation of around 20,000 white pines that are used as Christmas trees. In the summer when it does the most business, it employs approximately 320 workers.

Australian poets, just like their British counterparts, could be humorous, melancholy, angry or just longing for home. Many Australians, for example, wrote about the Australian flora, and how they missed it.

Sean Beavan returned to work with the band once again, taking on mixing and production duties for the new album. The band announced the completion of the album on December 22, 2018 via their official Instagram page and a tentative release window of Spring 2019 was set. The first single, \\"American Landfill\\", was released worldwide on April 5, 2019 alongside the official announcement of the July 5 global release date. Alongside the new album announcement, the band also announced a summer tour in support of Ministry. Frontman Mincolla described the new album as focusing on the idea of world versus world. \\"Thematically it's centered largely around concepts of accelerationism and the political heresy of inviting the end as an opportunity as a fresh start\\", Mincolla said. The music video for \\"American Landfill\\" debuted on April 15, 2019. The video was directed by Matthew Charles Santoro, longtime friend of Alexis Mincolla and Hollywood director and visual effects artist whose credits include X-Men Origins: Wolverine and 300. \\"EXXXIT\\" was released as the second single with an accompanying music video on April 23. \\"The song hinges on a conceptual ultimatum and the human urge towards self-destruction as a form of liberation,\\" Mincolla said.

Hirschman's 1970 treatise Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. \\"EXXXIT\\" was premiered alongside a North American tour announcement featuring Author & Punisher and GOST as support.

A fifth music video was released alongside the single as well. On why the band decided to do a cover song, Mincolla said \\"Industrial bands have a long history of subverting popular culture songs...We’ve just always been a fan of this sort of thing and felt it would be a good time to take an iconic song of the late 2000s and give it some unexpected 2019 industrial darkness.\\" On January 17, 2020, ALTÆR was released as the album's sixth single along with a music video.

Journal of Business Law and Governance. 6(1): 1-3. An example of the clause is illustrated in the following quote: “Each Term shall automatically renew for subsequent periods of the same length as the initial Term unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the then-current Term.\\" Firms that are involved in contracting for multiple years generally use this clause more often when compared to other firms. Also, firms engage in this legal process to gain economic benefits and reduce their costs. Examples of industries in which it is generally used include insurance, digital media, healthcare, telecommunications, fitness, mining and so forth. Legal complications of the clause inculcate the advance notice time period, extent of contract transparency and grounds for contract termination.Automatic Contract Renewal Act, 815 ILCS 601/1 USA. (2004) The clause may be unfairly used by businesses for increased revenues and profitability. Thus the regulation of these clauses is imperative, however, the process of implementing it and the penalties of its misuse vary across different countries and at times, states as well. Countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Australia have enacted laws governing this clause. == Economic rationale == The Neo-classical model of Economics embedded in the “rationality axiom” assumes economic agents to be rational decision makers. According to the theory, these economic agents leverage the costs and benefits of given options and then choose the option which maximizes their net utility or profitability. In line with the above theory, economic agents would consider the costs of contract renewal, (re)negotiation and termination prior to the decision making-process . Any changes in the terms of agreement of a contract might result in “transaction costs” which may or may not be greater than that of renewal of the same terms of agreement. Nonetheless, costs are incurred in both the situations. However, contracts cease to apply towards the end of the contracting period thus no costs are borne in the case of contract termination. The automatic renewal clause becomes an economically viable option in the case of contract renewals. In the case of firms contracting for single periods, contract termination is the optimal decision and the one that the rational consumer is likely to make as the contract would itself cease to exist without any costs. However, firms that intend to contract for multiple periods with each other and given that the terms of agreement would apply in each period, might find that they have to incur costs to renew the contract each time it has been terminated. Thus, in this situation firms might find that the automatic renewal clause is the better solution as no costs have to be incurred for contract renewals in each period except only once to terminate the clause. Another economically significant aspect of the clause is its impact on the firm’s profitability. Contract termination may negatively impact a firm’s earnings which the management may cater to by increasing the costs of contract termination for consumers. In line with the traditional economic theory, a rational economic actor would opt for the economically superior alternative which in this case would be contract renewal. == Enforceability in legal systems == The enforceability of the automatic renewal clause varies between countries. === United States === The legislation of the United States encompasses a federal and a state jurisdiction. States jurisdictions vary in terms of the regulation of the clause. Some states such as Florida, New York , Michigan, California and Illinois have enacted statutes governing the evergreen clause while others such as Louisiana do not have any such statutes. California is a heavily populated and economically significant state. It hosts a number of e-commerce, software development and digital media services' companies. In line with the California Business & Professional Code 17600-06 statute, the clause is enforceable in subscription services' contracts. It details that contracts should be “Clear and conspicuous” which entails \\"larger in size or contrasting in type, font, or color than surrounding text and in close proximity to the signature.\\" The Automatic Contract Renewal Act (815 ILCS 601/1) of Illinois emphasizes on contract transparency,\\"where such contract automatically renews unless the consumer cancels the contract, shall disclose the automatic renewal clause clearly and conspicuously in the contract, including the cancellation procedure\\", and communication of contract renewal to customers,\\"Written notice shall be provided to the consumer no less than 30 days and more than 60 days before the cancellation deadline pursuant to the automatic renewal clause\\", as legally customary for organizations employing this clause in their contracts. The applicability of the act does not extend to \\"business-to-business contracts\\" or \\"banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, savings banks, or credit unions licensed or organized under the laws of any state or the United States, or any foreign bank maintaining a branch or agency licensed or organized under the laws of any state of the United States, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.\\" === United Kingdom === The clause is regulated under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 in the United Kingdom which \\"aims to protect consumers against unfair contract terms and notices\\". Just as in the case of the Automatic Contract Renewal Act (815 ILCS 601/1) of Illinois, this act also emphasizes on contract transparency with regards to contract duration and cancellation, \\"Your customer needs to know how long their contract is due to run and how to cancel it (if they don’t want it renewed)\\". It highlights that \\"fair terms\\" should be employed in the contract to prevent consumers from harm. Examples of the unfair terms, listed below, have also been described in the act.The Consumer Rights Act, J Bus L159. (2015) * “This will be a rolling contract that will automatically renew unless you contact us 24 hours prior to renewal in order to cancel.” * “After expiry of the initial term, 3 months’ notice of cancellation is required…” The above two examples link to the provision of insufficient information to the consumer and inclusion of \\"Over-lengthy notice periods\\" in contracts. == Commercial uses == Commercial contracts in the leasing, digital media, insurance, telecommunications and fitness industries often inculcate the evergreen clause in their terms of agreement. ===Lease contracts === The clause is employed in Business to consumer, business-to- business and business-to-government lease contracts. Twin Metals has an auto- renewal mineral lease for the Superior National Forest of Minnesota Twin Metals, a U.S based mining conglomerate, has signed multiple, auto-renewal mineral leases with the Federal Government of United States. One of which allows the conglomerate to mine in the Superior National Forest of Minnesota for copper and other metals. During 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture noted concerns regarding the environmental damage in the Superior National Forest as a result of mining. This led to a point where an appeal was put forth for the prohibition of mining practices in the \\"234,000 acres\\" of Superior National Forest land for \\"20 years\\". However, the presence of the clause permitted Twin Metals to legally retaliate against the decision. Radio Rentals, a U.K. based consumer goods and services company specializing in appliance retail and rental, adopted a 2-3-4 years rental policy whereby consumers who were unable to afford an item rented it for a period of 2, 3 or 4 years. The commercial contract was inclusive of evergreen clause and detailed that the rented item must be purchased towards the end of the rental period to prevent the contract from renewing automatically for another rental term. === Digital Media === A number of digital media companies have been reported to adopt a unique marketing approach. In line with it, consumers are allowed to use the services offered for a limited period of time without any costs. Towards the end of this period, unless cancelled by the consumer, they are automatically subscribed to the service.Koren, Grinshpoon(2018). \\"License to Bill: The Validity of Coupling Automatic Subscription Renewals with Free Trial Offers by Online Services\\". Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal. 28 (2): 301–352. Amazon Prime is an auto-renewing subscription service Amazon.com, an American e-commerce multinational corporation, offers a multitude of online services such as Amazon Prime, Amazon Web services, Alexa and so forth to its consumers. Amazon Prime is a paid subscription service which provides consumers with exclusive content and services and these subscriptions renew automatically towards the end of the period. A similar business model has been adopted by online audio services' companies such as SoundCloud and Apple Music. === Insurance policies === In terms of insurance policies, the clause is widely used by companies such as UnitedHealth Group (USA), Allianz (Germany), Nippon Life (Japan), Life Insurance Corporation of India, Zurich Insurance Group (Switzerland), MLC Limited (Australia) and so forth. Given the types and coverage of insurance policies, certain insurance contracts such as property and medical have been noted more by media agents -such as newspapers- than others to inculcate this clause. The notice transmission and active cancellation periods of auto- renewals for these policies vary by country and region. In some cases, insurance companies may also increase the monthly payments for certain types of insurance policies in successive renewal periods. === Miscellaneous === Mobile phone services in the telecommunications industry and gym memberships in the fitness industry are also auto-renewed. In 2019, Mobile telecommunications network (MTN) company launched a subscription based mobile phone service in South Africa. The service was a 1MB mobile data plan that renewed automatically charging consumers \\"40c per megabyte every time they ran out of data\\" . Following this, it was highlighted that this was simply another form of an Out-of-Bundle Data Usage plan. As a result of the consumer backlash, the company was forced to withdraw its data plan. Some gyms may renew their long term memberships with an advance notice of less than a month Ashbourne Management Services is a UK based company mainly involved in the fitness industry. The company overseas and offers services for the development and management of gym contracts and collection of gym subscription fees. The company was found to renew its long term contracts (usually more than 12 months) with an advance notice of less than a month. Complaints were filed against this practice by two individuals which were deemed as just by the court with the ruling in the favor of the claimants. == Key Issues == === Termination === Contracts inclusive of the auto-renewal clauses can be terminated on the grounds of contract breach, mutual agreement of parties and some peculiar circumstances. The parties may wish to renegotiate or change the legal agreement. This could be achieved by dissolving the current contract and drafting a new one with the renegotiated obligations. In the case where one party has failed to honor its contractual obligations, the contract would terminate regardless of the clause and in some cases, compensations and settlements might be due. It should be noted, however, that some countries have laws governing the time length of contractual breach after which the contractual relationship can be voided. Lastly, contracts can also be cancelled on the basis of certain circumstances in areas such as healthcare. The contract will also be cancelled if the one party informs the other of its intent to discontinue the contractual relationship within the advance notice period detailed in the terms of agreement. Generally, this letter of intent is either provided some time before a specified number of days prior to the end of the contract, \\"This agreement shall automatically renew for another one (1) year term, unless either party provides notice to the other of its intent to terminate this agreement not less than thirty (30) days before the end of the then current term.\\" or during a specified number of days before the end of the contractual period, \\"This agreement shall automatically renew for another one (1) year term, unless either party provides notice to the other of its intent to terminate this agreement within thirty (30) days of the end of the then current term.\\" The letter of intent can be issued at any point in time before the specified number of days in the first case, while in the second one it must be issued within the highlighted number of days. === Deceptive practices === Apart from the legalities associated with the clause, a major issue linked to its usage is that of deceptive practices such as consumer fraud, unjust enrichment and violations of trade practices. Companies often inculcate this clause in their contracts to increase their revenues and profitability. Often, it is used in conjunction with other unfair trade practices such as overpricing. This is largely due to contract transparency whereby firms do not communicate enough or explicit information to consumers regarding the consent and advance notice time period of the auto-renewal clauses present in their contracts or subscriptions. As a result, consumers feel deceived and at an unfair advantage when their contracts have been auto-renewed without their agreement 180x180px ==== Stericycle ==== Stericycle is multinational corporation which specializes in health care specifically the waste disposal of medical and pharmaceutical products. In 2017, the company was accused of inflating it prices for a particular segment of its customers and auto- renewing their contracts without adequate contract transparency. The customers were largely government employees. As a result the government of Illinois had to bear losses because of the company's unethical business practices. In line with the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act,Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS /505/1 , USA. Stericycle was penalized in excess of millions not only for the losses but also for the violation of the act. == References == == External links == * Australian Contract Law * Uniform Commercial Code (United States Contract Law) * Principles of European Contract Law Category:Contract law ","title":"Automatic renewal clause"},{"id":"60416082","text":"Rivera is a surname of Spanish and Italian origin which was the old spelling of ribera, the Spanish word for \\"riverbank\\".

It was originally published in 1929 in Leningrad under the title Problems of Dostoevsky's Creative Art (Проблемы Творчества Достоевского) but was re-published with significant additions under the new title in 1963 in Moscow. The book was first translated into English in 1973 by R. William Rotsel but this version is now out of print.Caryl Emerson (1984). Acknowledgments to Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics. p. viii Caryl Emerson's 1984 translation is the version used for academic discussion in English. Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics is considered to be a seminal work in Dostoevsky studies and an important contribution to literary theory.Wayne C. Booth (1984). Introduction to Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics. pp. xiii–xxviiMorson and Emerson (1990). p. 284–85 Bakhtin introduces a number of key concepts, such as polyphony and carnivalisation, to elucidate what he saw as unique in Dostoevsky's literary art. He argues that Dostoevsky's works are essentially dialogical, unfolding on the basis of interaction between autonomous voices, as opposed to monological, where plot and character unfold within the confines of a single authorial universe.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 9 In consequence, it is argued that attempts to expound Dostoevsky's novels from any sort of monological critical perspective will always fail to penetrate them.Bakhtin (1984). p. 7 ==Summary of the work== There are 5 chapters, and a brief preface (\\"From the Author\\") and Conclusion. In the Preface Bakhtin writes: \\"We consider Dostoevsky one of the greatest innovators in the realm of artistic form. He created a completely new type of artistic thinking, which we have provisionally called polyphonic. This type of artistic thinking found its expression in Dostoevsky's novels, but its significance extends far beyond the limits of the novel and touches upon several basic principles of European aesthetics. It could even be said that Dostoevsky created something like a new artistic model of the world, one in which many basic aspects of old artistic form were subjected to a radical restructuring. The present work aims at bringing out, through theoretical literary analysis, this fundamental innovation of Dostoevsky.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 3 === Chapter 1: Dostoevsky's Polyphonic Novel and its Treatment in Critical Literature === Bakhtin begins by identifying polyphony as the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's work: \\"A plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices...\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 6 The discussion of polyphony and its incommensurability with the usual monological approach to writing and criticism is followed by an overview of the currently available scholarly literature on Dostoevsky, particularly that from Russia. Each critic or theorist is assessed according to the degree to which they approach an understanding of polyphony as the essential quality of Dostoevsky's writing.Morson and Emerson (1990). ch. 6. pp. 231–251 === Chapter 2: The Hero, and the Position of the Author with Regard to the Hero, in Dostoevsky's Art === According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky is not interested in characters as individuals or social types occupying a specific place in the author's universe, where who or what they are is fixed, defined, limited by certain 'objective' qualities. The hero interests Dostoevsky as a \\"particular point of view on the world and on oneself.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 47 Dostoevsky thus carries out a kind of \\"Copernican revolution\\" in fiction by making subjectivity and self-consciousness the basis for a character's exposition, so that even the functions usually reserved for the author or narrator (descriptions, characterisations, definitions etc) are transferred into the field of vision of the character themselves: \\"the author no longer illuminates the hero's reality but the hero's self-consciousness.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 49 Alongside the hero's consciousness, only other equally self-defining and self- validating consciousnesses can be juxtaposed. There can be no overriding authorial or narratorial voice: such a voice can only be another voice in the polyphonic texture. Bakhtin calls self-consciousness Dostoevsky's \\"artistic dominant\\".Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 238–39 === Chapter 3: The Idea in Dostoevsky === In Dostoevsky, the hero's discourse about himself is merged with his ideological discourse about the world. There is an \\"artistic fusion\\" of personal life with worldview that strengthens the integrity of self- signification in the face of the myriad forms of external definition.Bakhtin (1984). pp. 78–79 This fusion lends an unprecedented power to the idea in Dostoevsky. In a character of the monological type, an idea becomes \\"a mere aspect of reality, one more of reality's predetermined features\\": in Dostoevsky it acquires the power to live in the world through its fusion with an unfinalized consciousness in its interaction with others of the same kind.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 9 The idea, as Dostoevsky understood it, is not some sort of entity residing within a person's head, it is a \\"live event\\" played out in the realm of inter-subjectivity. Like the word, the idea inherently seeks the other's response: it is by nature dialogic. Its outwardly monologic form is merely the conventional form of expression that has emerged, according to Bakhtin, from the trend toward ideological monologism characteristic of modern times.Bakhtin (1984). p. 88 === Chapter 4: Characteristics of Genre and Plot Composition in Dostoevsky's Works === In the earlier work, this chapter only discussed the function of the adventure plot in Dostoevsky's novels. In the revised work it is greatly expanded to include discussions of Dostoevsky's place at the end of a literary tradition going back to the ancient world (Menippean satire), and his translation of the folk carnival ethos—where conventional behaviours and attitudes are suspended, undermined or overturned—into the literary realm (Carnivalisation).Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 85 === Chapter 5: Discourse in Dostoevsky === Bakhtin argues that dialogic interactions of the kind found in Dostoevsky are not reducible to forms that are studiable by linguistics and can only be understood as discourse. The discursive word is never separate from a subject who utters it in address to another subject: the word must be embodied for it to have any dialogical status. Bakhtin identifies three main types of discourse: (i) unmediated discourse directed exclusively toward its referential object; (ii) objectified discourse (of a represented person); (iii) discourse with an orientation toward someone else's discourse (double voiced discourse). It is this third type in its various forms (for example, internal dialogization) that is of primary interest to Bakhtin in his investigation into the dialogical process and its striking presence in Dostoevsky's writing.Bakhtin (1984). p. 199Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 147 ==Key concepts== ===Polyphony=== According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky was the creator of the polyphonic novel, and it was a fundamentally new genre that could not be analysed according to preconceived frameworks and schema that might be useful for other manifestations of the European novel.Bakhtin (1984). p. 7 Dostoevsky does not describe characters and contrive plot within the context of a unified, author-imposed reality: rather his function as author is to illuminate the self-consciousness of the characters so that each participates on their own terms, in their own voice, according to their own ideas about themselves and the world. The author's worldview is not absent, but this worldview does not define, limit or qualify the other voices, and hence cannot directly control how events will unfold. It is present only as another participant in \\"the great dialogue\\", with no more capacity for direct signification than any other voice. Bakhtin calls this multi-voiced, dialogic reality \\"polyphony\\". > What unfolds... is not a multitude of characters and fates in a single > objective world, illuminated by a single authorial consciousness; rather a > plurality of consciousnesses, with equal rights and each with its own world, > combine but are not merged in the unity of the event. Dostoevsky's major > heroes are, by the very nature of his creative design, not only objects of > authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying > discourse.Bakhtin (1984). pp. 6–7 He later describes it as \\"the event of interaction between autonomous and internally unfinalized consciousnesses.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 176 ===Unfinalizability=== Bakhtin summarizes the general principle behind unfinalizability in Dostoevsky thus: > Nothing conclusive has yet taken place in the world, the ultimate word of > the world and about the world has not yet been spoken, the world is open and > free, everything is still in the future and will always be in the > future.Bakhtin (1984). p. 166Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 37 On the individual level, this means that a person can never be entirely externally finalized. The ability to never be entirely enclosed in the dictates of the outside world is an essential attribute of consciousness. Though external objectification (definition, description, causal or genetic explanation etc) is inevitable, it can never be the whole truth, devoid of the living, dialogical response. That is what Bakhtin calls a \\"monologic\\" truth, and he is highly critical of tendencies in Western thought that seek to finalize humanity, and individual humans, in this way.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 91–92 According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky always wrote in opposition to currents of thought that turn human beings into objects (scientific, economic, social, psychological etc.), enclosing them in an alien web of definition and causation, robbing them of freedom and responsibility: \\"He saw in it a degrading reification of a person's soul, a discounting of its freedom and its unfinalizability... Dostoevsky always represents a person on the threshold of a final decision, at a moment of crisis, at an unfinalizable, and unpredeterminable, turning point for their soul.\\"Bakhtin (1984). pp. 61–62 ===Carnivalization=== Bakhtin derives his concept of carnival from ancient, medieval and Renaissance carnival traditions, which are united in their essential qualities by what he calls a \\"carnival sense of the world\\". Carnivalization is the translation of these essential qualities into the literary realm, beginning with the ancient seriocomic genres, such as Socratic Dialogue and Menippean Satire, and reaching its highest point in the novels of Rabelais and Dostoevsky. The concept suggests an ethos where normal hierarchies, social roles, proper behaviors and assumed truths are subverted in favor of the \\"joyful relativity\\" of free participation in the festival. Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson call Bakhtin's carnival \\"the apotheosis of unfinalizability\\".Morson and Emerson (1990). pp. 89–96 Carnival, through its temporary dissolution or reversal of conventions, generates the 'threshold' situations where disparate individuals come together and express themselves on an equal footing, without the oppressive constraints of social objectification: the usual preordained hierarchy of persons and values becomes an occasion for laughter, its absence an opportunity for creative interaction.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 95–96 In carnival, \\"opposites come together, look at one another, are reflected in one another, know and understand one another.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 176 Bakhtin sees carnivalization in this sense as a basic principle of Dostoevsky's art: love and hate, faith and atheism, loftiness and degradation, love of life and self-destruction, purity and vice, etc. \\"everything in his world lives on the very border of its opposite.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 176 Bakhtin emphasizes that the carnival mode of being and thinking is not based in abstraction, but in a creative participation in the intensities of real life. Like the traditional carnival, which is not merely a spectacle to be passively experienced, the carnivalized literary text implies the participation of the reader in the great dialogue.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 460–61 Carnivalistic categories are not \\"abstract thoughts about equality and freedom, the interrelatedness of all things or the unity of opposites... they are concretely sensuous ritual- pageant \\"thoughts\\" experienced and played out in the form of life itself, \\"thoughts\\" that had coalesced and survived for thousands of years among the broadest masses of European mankind\\",Bakhtin (1984). p. 123 and therein lies the source of their power in literary forms. ===Menippean satire=== Bakhtin discusses the development of Menippean satire from its origins in ancient Greece with the Cynic satirist Menippus, and examines its essential characteristics. These characteristics include intensified comicality, freedom from established constraints, bold use of fantastic situations for the testing of truth, abrupt changes, inserted genres and multi-tonality, parodies, oxymorons, scandal scenes, inappropriate behaviour, and a sharp satirical focus on contemporary ideas and issues.Morson and Emerson (1990). p. 490–91Bakhtin (1984). pp. 114–120 According to Bakhtin, the roots of the genre \\"reach directly back into carnivalized folklore\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 112 He notes its unparalleled capacity for reflecting the social and philosophical ethos of its ancient historical setting – principally the epoch of the decline of national legend, which brought with it the gradual dissolution of long- established ethical norms and a concomitant rise in free interaction and argumentation over all manner of \\"ultimate questions\\".Bakhtin (1984). p 119 Bakhtin credits Dostoevsky with revitalizing the genre and enhancing it with his own innovation in form and structure: the polyphonic novel.Bakhtin (1984). p. 120–21 Although he may not have consciously recognized his place as the heir of the tradition, he undoubtedly instinctively adopted many of its carnivalistic forms, as well as its liberated approach to the use of those forms, and adapted them to his own artistic purposes. In polyphony, the dialogical freedom of Menippean satire is taken to a new and more profound level: character voices are liberated from the finalizing and monologizing influence of authorial control, much as the participants in carnival revel in the temporary dissolution of authoritarian social definitions and established truths, allowing a new type of \\"purely human\\" dialogue to emerge. ===Double- voiced discourse=== In Dostoevsky \\"almost no word is without its intense sideward glance at someone else's word.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 203 There is a great diversity of discursive styles characterised by their orientation toward another's discourse, which Bakhtin calls double-voiced discourse. The diversity is underscored by the continual sudden transition from one style to another: \\"from parody to internal polemic, from polemic to hidden dialogue, from hidden dialogue to stylization in serene hagiographic tones, then back to parodistic narration, and finally to an extremely intense open dialogue... All this is interwoven with the deliberately dull thread of informative documentary discourse...\\" But even this dry documentary discourse registers \\"the bright reflections or dense shadows of nearby utterances\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 203 In the monological novel, the author's ultimate semantic authority is always exerted over whatever discourse types are introduced. Intensifying the accents of others' discourse only serves the ultimate purpose of accentuating the author's own ideological concerns; the outcome of the struggle for dominance between voices is decided in advance; sooner or later everything is gathered together in a single voice representing that of the author. Dostoevsky goes in the opposite direction: his artistic purposes are served by the activation and intensification of autonomous voices in their relation to each other. His aim is a plurality of voices, not homogenization. Discourse is almost never \\"objectified\\" in Dostoevsky: his novels live and develop in the dialogical interaction of subjective voices and consciousnesses, and thus no particular voice, even and especially that of the author, can have the capacity for finalization of another. According to Bakhtin, > \\"the orientation of one person to another person's discourse and > consciousness is, in essence, the basic theme of all Dostoevsky's works. The > hero's attitude toward himself is inseparably bound up with his attitude > toward another, and with the attitude of another toward him. His > consciousness of self is constantly perceived against the backdrop of the > other's consciousness of him—\\"I for myself\\" against the backdrop of \\"I for > another\\".\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 207 ==See also== *Rabelais and His World *Dialogue (Bakhtin) ==References== Category:1929 non-fiction books Category:1963 non-fiction books Category:Books about literary theory Category:Russian non-fiction books Category:Works about Fyodor Dostoyevsky ","title":"Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics"},{"id":"60416115","text":"Zadra is a steel roller coaster located at Energylandia in Zator, Poland.

Her artwork reflected topics involving domesticity and sensuality of the human body. She emphasized topics of the female body by using objects to create irony. Römer had diverse knowledge in many mediums including silkscreen, pencil, oil painting, and sometimes assemblages or collages involving found objects. == Biography == Born October 7, 1938 in Caracas, Venezuela and died in 2005. Römer used conceptual language and objects in her work to refer to the human body. In 1976, Römer became part of a curatorial team for the Galeria de Arte Nacional in Caracas. She was a director of Sala Mendoza art foundation. In the 1970s, Römer focused on incorporating messages about violence and corruption awareness within her art. During the late 1980s, she turned her focus on environmental and social issues. She was an educator and art historian who wrote about Venezuelan art and the culmination of installation art and conceptual art. Römer participated in group exhibitions and events including 1973 XII São Paulo Biennial and the 1981 São Paulo Biennial. Römer's earliest teachers were Armando Lira and Lucio Rivas where she learned the importance of color. Later studied under Cristóbal Rojas at the school of Plastic and Applied Arts from 1969 to 1971.It was in 1973 that she entered an Engraving workshop of Luisa Palacios in which Römer learned about pop art concepts and figuration. In 1974, she began using discarded objects and painting them vibrant colors to give them a sense of alternate meaning. Margot Römer is most known for her urinal and nationality works in which she paints them in multicolor, often colors of the Venezuelan flag and gives them a smooth organic appearance. In 1978, she began her work on flags and nationality at \\"The International Drawing Triennial\\" in Poland. She began teaching at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in the Metropolitan university until 1982. Römer left for the United States in 1982, and exhibited artwork in \\"Artists from the Continent\\" in Virginia. She volunteered at Museum of Modern Art in New York in the cataloging and graphic work for the department in prints and illustrated books. She returned to Venezuela in 1984, where she started artworks featuring mountains covered in national flags.WIKIHistoria del arte Venezolano.06-15-2016.http://vereda.ula.ve/wiki_artevenezolano/index.php/R%C3%B6mer,_MargotMargot Römer,\\"The Urinal of Marcel Duchamp\\"2005.https://interpretacionmargotromer.wordpress.com/ == Art Works == Aparato reproductor de la mujer (Woman's reproductive system) Made in 1972 with acrylic paint over a wooden door and cactus in a flower pot placed within the window of the door.

As a young woman she expressed a desire to become an actress or a singer. She sang in the choir while at school. After graduating from high school she visited her aunt in Chicago. During that visit she was noticed by a booking agency which managed to obtain a 15 minute singing engagement for her on a Chicago radio station. Although the reaction to her work was positive, she found the experience so overwhelming that she did not look for more work as a singer at that time. After two years she tried again, and started working as the featured vocalist for Hal Kemp's dance band where she remained for 18 months. In 1933 she signed with CBS to perform on Camel Caravan where she sang with the Casa Loma Orchestra and worked with host, Walter O'Keefe, until the show format was changed in 1936.

She is most well known for her work as the librarian of the El Paso Public Library. == Biography == === Early life and education === Sullivan was born in 1870 in Ripon, Wisconsin, although some sources state she was born in 1872. Her parents were Fayette Durlin, a reverend, and Anna L. Root. The family moved to Madison, Wisconsin when Sullivan was a little girl. She was educated at Kemper Hall, a local Episcopal school, with her siblings and other neighborhood kids. In 1895, she moved to Brooklyn, New York to study art and music at the New York School of Applied Design for Women (later known as the Pratt-New York Phoenix School of Design). After finishing her studies in 1896, she moved back to Madison and opened an art studio. In 1904, she became a library assistant at the Eau Claire Public Library, located in Madison, and in 1905 worked as a library assistant at the Oshkosh Public Library in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Sullivan then decided to pursue a career as a librarian and returned to New York in 1905 to study library science at the Pratt Library School (now called the Pratt School of Information). == Career == === El Paso Public Library === After graduating in 1908 from library school, she moved to El Paso, Texas in August to be the librarian of the El Paso Public Library after Clara Mulliken resigned. In 1912, she married John Kevin Sullivan, a mining engineer, at St. Clement's Church and moved with him to New Mexico's Mogollan Mountains, located in the Gila Wilderness. The couple returned to El Paso in April 1917 and Sullivan resumed her position at the library. During her time at the library, she worked hard to expand its resources and strengthen its connection to the El Paso Community. The arts were important to Sullivan, and she made the library an artistic and cultural center by increasing the materials about art and supporting local artists. She increased the number of books on subjects like art, art history, archaeology, and history. In addition, she would display the works of local artists at the library and had art exhibits from galleries in New York come to the library. Sullivan also became friends with various artists, including Peter Hurd, Jean Carl Hertzog Sr., Tom Lea III, Jose Cisneros, and Fremont Ellis. Because of El Paso's high Spanish-speaking population, Sullivan expanded the library's Spanish-language collection. She even taught herself Spanish so that she would be better able to pick the best Spanish-language books to add to the library's collection. During her career, the library acquired more than 2,000 volumes in Spanish. In addition to expanding the library's cultural and Spanish collections, she created the library's mining reference section, which has been used by engineers throughout the Southwest. She also increased the library's collection of musical scores as well as public documents published by the US government. Since history was very important to Sullivan (especially Southwest history), she worked hard to expand the library's Southwest collection, which includes materials about Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico. The efforts to expand the Southwest collection began in 1920 and is being expanded to this day. Writer J. Frank Dobie was impressed with Sullivan's work and donated his notes and manuscript of Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver to the El Paso Public Library. During her time at the El Paso Public Library, the library acquired 3,481 volumes on southwest history. In 1919, the library had 17,453 books; in 1929, that number increased to 36,842 volumes; by 1940, there were 112,290 books and pamphlets. In 1935, the El Paso Public Library became one of only two libraries in Texas, and one out thirty libraries in the US to receive the Carnegie Art Reference Set, a collection of 1,400 prints and 127 books on art. === Other library work === Sullivan was heavily involved with regional, national, and international library organizations. She was the president of the Texas Library Association from 1923 to 1925. During that time, she started the organization's official bulletin News Notes, with its first issue published in November 1924. She served as the editor until 1927. Sullivan was part of an effort by the Texas Library Association (TLA) to ensure that those serving in Texas during World War I had access to reading material. They held book collecting drives and fundraisers to increase reading supplies and to help with the war effort. In addition, the El Paso Public Library was a base for troops stationed at the Mexican border. Sullivan, along with other Texas librarians, expressed a desire to increase the public services libraries could offer. At the 1922 TLA Convention held in Austin, Texas, they met with librarians from bordering states to discuss their goals and soon formed the Southwestern Library Association. While establishing the association was a group effort, Sullivan and fellow librarian Dorothy Amann (TLA president from 1921 to 1922) are credited for conducting most of the organizational work. Sullivan's passion for libraries went beyond the state and national levels. In 1927, she spent two months in Mexico City to study their libraries. The following year, she guided six Mexican librarians around libraries in the United States. She wrote about these experiences in her article “A Library Pilgrimage” published in a 1928 issue of the Bulletin of the American Library Association. That same year, she attended the West Baden Conference, which was sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace. Sullivan also traveled to Puerto Rico in 1932 to study the island's libraries. In 1935, as part of the international relations committee of the Carnegie Foundation, Sullivan represented the United States at the International Congress of Librarians and Bibliographers held in Spain. She was one of four US citizens to attend the conference. == Publications and other endeavors == Sullivan wrote a variety of articles, lectures, and speeches throughout her career. She wrote for the El Paso Times and the El Paso Herald-Post mostly about subjects pertaining to libraries and her experiences while in Puerto Rico and Spain. Among her other publications are “Old Roads and New Highways in the Southwest,” which describes the history and expansion of the Southwest. She read the essay at the American Library Association at Los Angeles, California in June 1930. Outside of the library, Sullivan was interested in art and archaeology. She served as the treasurer and secretary of the El Paso Archaeological Society from 1922 to 1938 and was also involved with the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers. In addition, she lectured on art at the Art Study Club of the Woman's Club of El Paso. == Personal life == Sullivan was good friends with Betty Mary Goetting, a librarian and women's rights activist, and was the godmother to her son, Kurt Goetting. Kurt described Sullivan as \\"a tall woman who was quiet and direct when you talked with her.\\" == Death == Sullivan died on December 28, 1943, due to complications from an ankle injury. Artists Tom Lea III and Jean Carl Hertzog Sr., who were close friends of Sullivan, were pallbearers at her funeral. In 1962, the El Paso Historical Society posthumously inducted Sullivan into their Hall of Honor, in recognition of her career and contributions to El Paso. == References == Category:1870 births Category:1943 deaths Category:American librarians Category:Women librarians Category:People from Ripon, Wisconsin Category:People from El Paso, Texas Category:People from Madison, Wisconsin Category:New York School of Applied Design for Women alumni ","title":"Maud Durlin Sullivan"},{"id":"60416442","text":"Sarah Bergbreiter is a professor of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, previously a professor at the University of Maryland.

ISSN 0147-7706 The story was originally published in 1958. == Description == From Below the Bridge was written by Yong-ik in 1958; the story was published in Mademoiselle the same year. The story was one of 13 short stories published by Kim in a 1969 compilation titled Love in Winter. Along with Village Wine (written by Kim in 1976), From Below the Bridge was included in Martha Foley's The Best American Short Stories. The work was self-translated by Kim from Korean into English.Hybridity in the Cultural Translation and Self-translation of Kim Yong Ik’s Works. The Journal of Translation Studies. Abbr: JTS. 2014, vol.15, no.3 == Plot == The story takes place near Pusan, South Korea, several months after the beginning of the Korean War. A family (a father, mother, boy, and a dog) of farmers has fled from their homes in Sang Po, and now live under a bridge. The father is very traditional, wearing a gat, while his son is more modern, having learned how to make money off of the \\"long-nose\\" American soldiers (by shining shoes and leading them to \\"Shibi-Shibi\\" girls—prostitutes—to be serviced), going so far as to adopt parts of their jargon. The mother takes pride in her son's money making skills, and views her husband as weak, much to his chagrin.From Below the Bridge. Kim Yong-ik, 1956. The family is destitute, but plans to return home by train. Their dog, however, is sickened after being over-fed by soldiers, and at the station the son refuses to part with him. In an ensuing confrontation, the father's gat is knocked off, revealing him to be a young man. This draws disparaging comments from the crowd, as most young men have been drafted to fight in the war; many assume that the father only wears his gat so that he can pass as an older man and avoid having to fight. The father, angered and frustrated by the lack of respect being shown to him and his heritage, chooses to walk back to Sango Po, telling his family to take next day's train. The mother and son return to their bridge to find it occupied by another refugee woman. The dog's condition worsens, and the boy wanders a nearby town, which is filled with churchgoers and \\"Shibi-Shibi\\" girls pairing with their American lovers. After military police scatter the prostitutes, the boy finds his mother among them. Despairing, he flees into the countryside, followed by his mother and his dying dog. The dog soon collapses, whereupon the mother and son silently stay with him. At nightfall, a passing elderly farmer allows the dog into his horse-drawn cart, promising to bury him when he dies. He tells the couple a story about the origin of the gat - explaining that the garment was intentionally designed to be delicate and easy to knock off so as to deter men from fighting. The son walks off, realizing he can never reveal what he has learned that night. == Themes == The short story places heavy emphasis on the changes—both subtle and overt—brought on by the Korea War. It explores the breakdown of traditional Korean society, as seen with the disrespect shown to the father, the need-driven willingness of the mother to be exploited, and the amoral, war-driven entrepreneurial dealings of the boy. The short story has been cited as an example of cultural translation, as it blends cultural and literary tradition from both Korea and America while also segregating some aspects of both traditions. == References == Category:Korean-American literature Category:1958 short stories Category:Korean War fiction ","title":"From Below the Bridge"},{"id":"60416616","text":"Deborah C.

She specializes in painting with mixed media. Her work reflects the immigrant experience of a search for self-identification and the problems of living on the edge between two cultures. Suárez's art pieces are representative of culture, social, and political dynamics. ==Biography== Bibiana Suárez was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. She spent her elementary school years in Guayama, Puerto Rico, an industrial town with mainland American companies. Suárez returned to Mayagüez to attend high school and then art school at the College of Mayagüez, which she attended for two years. In 1980, she moved to Chicago to keep pursuing her education at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts in Painting and Drawing. She has participated in solo and group exhibitions, exhibiting in Mexico, the United States, and Puerto Rico. Suárez is known for her installation of Memoria, which includes a pair matching Memory game of 108 mixed media paintings that discuss Latinization of U.S. culture. In her paintings and drawings, Suárez addresses psychological, political, and social conditions of the immigrant experience in the United States of America. Suárez is a Professor of Art in the Department of Art, Media, and Design at DePaul University in Chicago. == Education == In 1989, Bibiana Suárez obtained her Master of Fine Arts in Painting and Drawing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Previously, Suárez achieved in 1984 her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting and Drawing, at the same institution where she achieved her master's degree, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. == Artworks == ===De Pico a Pico (Beak to Beak)=== Created in 1993, the artwork was made using pastel and charcoal on paper, which measures 74x84 in. Two roosters are illustrated in challenging positions from one another. One bird reflects a healthy, fat, and feathered rooster. In opposition, the other rooster is solely sketched as a skeleton. Despite their differences in appearance, they both are beak to beak at the same angle. The intent of the image is to portray the power struggles of Puerto Rico and the United States. The United States is presented as the healthy and dominating rooster, yet the weakened rooster is Puerto Rico but courageously continues to face the conqueror despite its setbacks. ===Frito Bandito at the Water Hole no.1=== This illustration was made with the medium of archival inkjet print. The back scenery has mountains, cowboys, horses, and yellow fields. On the dirt, the cowboys are laying down with their rifles in hand and the horses stand to the back of them. Frito Lay hangs upside down at the top of the illustration, where he is smiling and has one hand directing straight and the other folded. Frito Lay is drawn in black and white. The intent of the image illustrates a more positive image of being immigrant in which there was a time the thought of having immigrants was great. ===Lactating Breast=== From 1997 to 1998, this art piece contains the media of IRIA digital print on paper and flashe paint, prisma color, and graphite. The background of the painting is a breast, where inside of the breast an image of a half Jesus and half an Uncle Sam are illustrated. Their faces and body are half and half of each. The surrounding is painted royal blue. Suarez, as seen with previous works of hers depicting being part of two cultures, connects political and psychological issues, by using religion and a past U.S. president. ===Rio de Agua Viva (River of Live Water)=== The painting measures 84 by 61 inches. With a single palm tree, an island is painted. The background is red in company of the waving of lines that represent giant jellyfish surrounding the island. Suárez claims the island represents Puerto Rico by being invisible, dispensable, and ignored by the United States. The painting was part of the exhibition \\"In Search of an Island\\". ===Wounded Heart=== Dating from 2005 to 2011, the above artwork used the medium of acrylic paint and laser transfer. The art piece's background is a bright green, with the number 27 in the top right corner. In the center, the heart is illustrated with bright colors of yellow, red, blue, and light pink. The heart is wounded with blood gushing out. El Corazon (The Heart) is written at the bottom left corner. The intent of this piece reflects on the broader issue of acceptance and welcome as an immigrant. == Exhibitions == ===Solo=== *Domino/Domíno at El Museo del Barrio, New York (1998) and Illinois Art Gallery, Chicago (1999) *Island Adrift: The Puerto Rican Identity in Exile at Taller Puertorriqueño, Philadelphia (1993) *Memory/Memoría at the Hyde Park Art Center, Chicago, Illinois (2011-2012) *Beak to Beak- Face to Face at Sazama Gallery, Chicago, Illinois (1993) *In Search of an Island at Sazama Gallery, Chicago, Illinois (1991) *A Grafito at Art Students League, San Juan, Puerto Rico (1985) ===Group=== *Puerto Rican Equation at Hunter College, New York (1998) *Expresiones Hispanas begins at Mexican Cultural Institute in San Antonio, Texas (1988-1989) *1898 DIWA Arts at Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York (1998) *Second Sight: Printmaking at Mary Leigh Block Gallery of Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois (1996) *National Drawing Invitational at the Arkansas Art Center in Little Rock (1992) *In the Heart of the Country at the Chicago Cultural Center (1991) *Advina!

In 1965, at his father's request, Mema, who at that time was Partizani's most paid player, made a sensational return to 17 Nëntori winning four championships , whom he stayed until 1971, the year in which he decided to end his career. He was able to play with his brother Ali in his second spell, helping the club to win three more league titles. ==Style of play== In his prime, Mema was noted for his acceleration, speed, stamina and work rate. He played as a Defensive midfielder, but nevertheless he also tended to make runs forward, which also made him an attacking threat. ==Personal life== Osman was part of Mema dynasty, a family which has produced several footballers throughout the years. His brothers Haxhi and Ali were both footballers, as well as his nephew and Haxhi's son Sulejman, and Ali's son Ardian, who was also a footballer who played mostly for Tirana and is currently its coach. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Football Database Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Tirana Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:KF Tirana players Category:FK Partizani Tirana players Category:Albanian Superliga players ","title":"Osman Mema"},{"id":"60416839","text":" His Majesty's hired armed schooner Flying Fish, later renamed Gertrude, served the Royal Navy from 19 June 1804 to 15 December 1804 when the frigate accidentally ran her down and sank her; Aigle rescued the crew.

Otto was a native of Schwarzerden near Pfeffelbach, and came to the Thirteen Colonies as a young man, arriving aboard the ship Edinburgh on October 2, 1753. He married Anna Catharine Dauterich; their children were born in Lancaster and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania. Beginning in 1755 he advertised himself as a weaver. From 1777 until 1780 he saw military service in the American Revolutionary War. He appears to have worked as a schoolmaster for numerous Reformed Protestant churches; from around 1769 until 1779 he was associated with an institution in Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania, and later he lived in Mahanoy Township, then in Northumberland County, where he likely taught at St. Peter's Lutheran and Reformed Church. Otto began producing fraktur in the 1760s; he was among the first artists to create birth certificates using the style. His earliest pieces are completely hand-drawn, very colorful and detailed. By 1784 he was having baptismal certificates printed at the press of the Ephrata Cloister; the woodblocks used to decorate the pieces may have been designed by him as well. Some of them contain longer certificates which appear to justify infant baptism, a practice generally disdained by Mennonites in the area. Otto also created broadsides featuring Adam and Eve during his career, as well as spiritual mazes, bookplates, and presentation pieces. The birds that he drew were later copied by other artists, who also borrowed the style of his text. His four sons, Jacob, William, Daniel, and Conrad became fraktur artists, as did Conrad's son Peter. Johann Otto died in Mahanoy Township. Five works either known to be by Otto or ascribed to him are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!/search?artist=Otto,%20Johann%20Heinrich$Johann%20Heinrich%20Otto Five more are owned by the Winterthur Museum, while four are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 2017, 25 million people migrated within and outside it. Most of migration in Africa occurs within the continent as 19 million people moved between African countries. The surge in international migration within Africa is due in part by the efforts of African states and international institutions to enhance regional integration. Regional migration in the African continent is also largely facilitated by the development of infrastructure and diffusion of western languages and culture. == African migration trends == === Statistical overview === As of 2017, 38 million out of the total 258 million global international migrants were born in Africa. 48 out of 58 countries in Africa had at least one source of data accounting for migration statistics; the amount of migrants included in data from the 2000 census or later was about 79 percent. International migrants accounted for two percent or less of the total population of Africa between 2000 and 2017. Of the twenty largest countries of destination for international migrants, one is located on the African continent. In 2000, Côte d’Ivoire was the top destination for international migrants but has since changed to South Africa by 2017. The number of international migrants originating in Africa grew by 68 percent since 2000, the largest growth rate of a region of origin in the world. North America was the fastest growing destination for migrants born in Africa between 2000 and 2017. For migrants born in Europe, one of the fastest growing destinations was Africa. Although small in absolute numbers of migrants, the fastest growing destination for international migrants born in Oceania and in Latin America and the Caribbean was Africa with a 7 per cent increase per year (15,000 and 22,000 migrants, respectively). 53 percent of total African migrants resided within the region. === General trends === Intra-African continental migration tends to be highest in West-African countries, Southern African countries and small states (Lesotho and Eritrea). Intra-continental emigration trends are low in densely populated countries such as Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa as well as in the Maghreb, where most tend to migrate to Europe. == Reasons for migration == Economic factors are the main drivers of international migration in Africa as many migrants cross borders to find employment. Education and family reasons are cited as the second and third most common reasons. Among women, family is the most common reason for migration. Trans-border migration, while largely driven by immediate and specific economic needs, is largely intended to be temporary. Nevertheless, many low-skilled foreign workers end up staying well beyond their intended time. Further, unskilled migrant workers are often classified as temporary migrants in literature on Sub-Saharan African migration, rather than long term or permanent immigrants, regardless of their legal status. Some of the large swaths of migration in Africa is also often induced by political instability, dramatic regime changes, ethnic tensions, and civil wars which are referred to as forced migration. According to official data, about fourteen percent of international migration in Africa is characterized as forced and involve individuals in \\"refugee-like\\" situations. In contrast to popular belief, about 86 percent of African migration is not related to conflict. == International migration systems == === South African migration system === The South African Migration System is centered around South Africa and has been developed since the late 19th century in parallel with the emergence and growth of the South African Mining industry. The South African Migration System is defined in large part by the political and economic preeminence of South Africa as a destination for migrants within the continent. === West African migration system === The West African Migration System emerged from the legacies of the French and British colonial empires. Some scholars argue that migration dynamics in West Africa have been attributed to the formation of capitalist economies and the spread of capitalism to other urban settlements and the countryside result in regional and social inequalities. Migration patterns in the West African Migration System are diverse than the South African Migration System because of a lack of a single powerful magnet for migrants (like South Africa). Foreigners made up almost a quarter of Cote d'Ivoire's population until civil war broke out between 2002 and 2004 that undermined its once buoyant economy. == Role of states and regional international institutions == Historically, colonial occupation and the slave trade have shaped the contemporary migration patterns within and from the African continent. During colonial liberation, millions of Africans fled conflicts with colonial powers. The establishment of independent states did not entirely create peaceful conditions; political and economic factors as a result of new conflicts contributed to uncertainty as an incentive to leave one's home state. Under authoritarian regimes, many more people may wish to migrate but cannot because of the government's increasing willingness to control and restrict emigration. Characteristics of the state- formation process such as nationalism, anti-colonial sentiment, xenophobia and protectionism are used in similar vein by several African governments such as Algeria, Egypt and Cote d'Ivoire to discourage emigration (fearing the loss of human capital) and to restrict immigration or foreigners. Political stability and national wealth have a particular influence on migration trends in that individuals are less likely to emigrate when they can imagine a future in their home country. Those with higher educational and occupational specializations tend to move across borders in search of more diversified and complex labor markets and social opportunities. A recent analysis of global migrant stock data found a significantly positive relationship between a state's level of political freedom and emigration. In recent years, regional international institutions in Africa have worked to enhance regional integration on the continent by reducing barriers to immigration. Regional economic communities such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as well as the East African Community (EAC) have cited free movement of persons as a key tenant of their drive toward greater integration. Further, ECOWAS has eliminated visa requirements for citizens of member states to support the free movement of people, goods and capital throughout the region. The South African Development Community (SADC) also works to promote integration and cooperation among member states. Further, in 2018 the African Union adopted a continent wide protocol on free movement to enhance intra- regional migration. Most migrants in Africa chose to stay within the region because the prospect of relocating in Europe or north America is tempered by the reality of cumbersome and highly restrictive visa requirements. == Experience of African migrants == Public xenophobia is often a characteristic of the experience of migrants in sub-saharan Africa, as is in many other parts of the world. It is reinforced by and reinforces state-level hostility as there is often a lack of an adequate legal protection framework for migrants. Many migrants become targets of harassment and violence, especially in times of economic downturns. For example, In Cote d’Ivoire, real or imagined migratory status, combined with religion and ethnicity, was used by the government as a political mobilization tool in the recent civil conflict. While prolonged and indefinite settlements of large groups of migrants often lead to formation of immigrant communities, it is an understudied area in Africa. === Female migration === Cross border migration offers women traders a path for economic advancement. There is significant evidence that illustrates the feminization trend of sub-saharan international migration, yet women's motivations for crossing international borders varies greatly from those of men. While men migrate to south Africa mainly for work, for women, work reasons for migration rank below family visits, shopping, selling goods, and obtaining medical care. Women tend to engage in short distance and short term transborder moves while men's migration tends to be longer distance. == See also == * Free movement protocol * Threats facing illegal immigrants == References == Category:Human migration ","title":"Intra-African migration"},{"id":"60417089","text":"R.J.

He is considered a pioneer of early, web-based digital media including as president of MSNBC.com in the 1990s. From the early 2000s, he led the restructuring and development of Europe's largest, independent fiber and cloud infrastructure business, Interoute Communications, Ltd. Interoute was sold in 2018 for $2.3 billion (€1.9 billion). == Early life and marriage == James Kinsella was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of six children. His father, Robert Kinsella, was a travelling salesman who sold sacramental wine to Roman Catholic churches. One of his brothers is John Kinsella, a renowned neonatologist and professor at the University of Colorado Medical School. Kinsella graduated from Lindbergh High School in St Louis and Haverford College. He is married to Robert McNeal, his longtime business partner who is also a former pilot and captain in the US Air Force. == Career == Kinsella worked as a journalist for several US media companies, including the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and Time. He is the author of the book Covering the Plague, which shows how the media and medical experts fumbled the AIDS story. Kinsella was a founder of the first major media company's web- based venture, Time, Inc.’s Pathfinder. The site was a groundbreaking but controversial effort to make Time, Inc. and its parent company Time Warner the leaders in digital media. He later managed Microsoft's joint media venture with NBC, MSNBC, launched in 1996. He served as a vice president at Microsoft and president of the Microsoft-managed part of the venture, MSNBC.com. In June 2000, Kinsella became chairman and CEO of World Online, the European equivalent at the time to AOL owned by the Sandoz Family Foundation. The Company had gone public in the spring of that year but was quickly dogged by the revelation that its founder and chairwoman, Nina Brink, had secretly sold shares at a drastic discount to the flotation price. Kinsella replaced Brink as chairman and CEO and quickly set about cutting costs – including cancelling the private plane Brink had leased as well as stopping a multimillion-euro ad campaign featuring Sarah Ferguson, then known as Princess Fergie. Kinsella eventually merged World Online with its Italian competitor, Tiscali, in a sale valuing World Online at $5.1 billion. Following the merger, Kinsella became chairman and CEO of the Sandoz Family Foundation's other major investment in European technology, Interoute Communications Ltd. The Company was launched in 1996 to develop a pan-European digital infrastructure for the booming web- based sector but suffered from the collapse of the dotcom bubble. In 2002, Kinsella brought Interoute out of bankruptcy, slashing hundreds of jobs in the process. In the aftermath of the dotcom bubble as well as during the 2008 financial crisis, Interoute acquired a series of heavily discounted European assets, including the failed KPNQwest’s Ebone network and one of the world's first business-to-business ISPs, PSINet Europe. In response to the rise of data-privacy concerns and the emerging General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kinsella launched a European-based competitor in the data storage and sharing industry, called Zettabox. The company was described by the European Commission as \\"an example of a genuinely European cloud storage solution\\" and a \\"GDPR by design\\" alternative. He was widely referenced in the media as a GDPR entrepreneur. Interoute was sold to GTT in March 2018 for $2.3 billion (€1.9 billion). == Advocacy == Kinsella was a founder in 1996 of the Internet Content Coalition, a not-for-profit association of producers and distributors of original content on the Internet. Its primary role was to help create a responsible and business-friendly environment through advocacy, education, standardization and policy, with the secondary goal of preventing laws that might block the development of the Internet's creative potential. Two decades later, as a tech executive in the European Union, he worked to develop privacy tools to combat rampant violation of individual users' data. He also lobbied the European Union on implementation of the ground-breaking EU law GDPR. He subsequently pushed for the adoption of a US version of GDPR. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:American businesspeople Category:American chief executives Category:American technology chief executives Category:British technology chief executives Category:Businesspeople from Missouri Category:Haverford College alumni ","title":"James Kinsella (journalist and tech entrepreneur)"},{"id":"60417131","text":"Daniel Otto (c. 1770 - 1822) was an American fraktur artist. == Biography == Otto was born in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, the son of fraktur artist Johann Henrich Otto.

There, he was able to enroll at the École royale des élèves protégés under the sponsorship of Nicolas Guy Brenet, and entered the studios of Francesco Casanova; completing his studies in 1777. He had several patrons, including , Jean-Georges Wille and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. In addition to Casanova, he studied with (1775) and Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié (1776 and 1779).Emmanuel Bénézit, Dictionnaire critique et documentaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs de tous les temps et de tous les pays, R. Roger et F. Chernoviz, 1919, Vol.3 In 1776, he produced his first major works, in the galant style of Fragonard and Debucourt. In 1778, they were produced as color engravings by . He rapidly became a favorite painter among the high society of his time. Many of his works are fêtes galantes featuring actors, dancers and powerful men with their mistresses, engaged in frivolous activities. He entered the service of Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, and created works for his \\"Secret Museum\\". Many were of a risqué or lascivious nature. Some were turned into engravings by Gabriel Marchand (c. 1755-18?). Among his later patrons from Strasbourg was the piano maker, Sébastien Érard. Despite the variety of his works, and their focus, he described himself as a \\"history painter\\". His works have also been compared to those of Watteau. In 1787, he married Marie-Catherine Naudé. During the Directory, due to his association with the Ancien Régime he, his wife and children lived in the staircase of a chapel in the Louvre. Later they lived in the phalanstery at the ruins of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Once the Revolution had taken a more settled form, he emerged to continue painting, but had to devote himself to more austere, patriotic themes. These included children kissing the feet of Liberty and the heroic actions of William Tell.Société d’études et de publications économiques, Connaissance des arts, 1954, Vol.23-34. The Revolution did not, however, change people's tastes, so he returned to his previous themes as soon as possible. This time, he used mythology as a pretext for painting naked women in bucolic scenes.Petits Théâtres de l’intime : La Peinture de genre française entre Révolution et Restauration. Online, Toulouse, Musée des Augustins. He had major showings at the Salons of 1793, 1798 and 1806. As one might suppose, many of his works were unsigned and, during the 19th century, were variously attributed to Fragonard, Antoine-François Callet and Jean-Baptiste Huet. Some of his early works were signed \\"Challe\\", possibly to take advantage of the popularity of Charles-Michel-Ange Challe. Eventually, these problems were sorted out and it is now believed that most of his works have been properly attributed. == Selected paintings == File:Heroism of Wilhelm Tell mg 0097.jpgThe Heroism of William Tell File:La Frayeur maternelle, première partie.jpgThe Mother's Fright File:Schall-Mischievous.pngThe Mischievous Ones File:Morgentoilet Rijksmuseum SK-A-3260.jpegMorning Toilette File:Schall, Frederic - Zephyr Crowning Flora -.jpgZephyrus Crowning Flora ==References== == Further reading == * André Girodie, Jean Frédéric Schall (Strasbourg 1752 Paris 1825): Un peintre de fêtes galantes, A. & F.

Excavating primarily in the 1950s, Phillips unearthed artifacts from the ancient kingdom of Sabaʾ. He was famous in the United States for his dashing style and adventurous stories, leading to his nickname, \\"America's Lawrence of Arabia\\". Following his archaeological career, Phillips acquired oil concessions in Oman, Venezuela, South Korea, Indonesia, and other countries, which made him the largest individual holder of oil rights in the world, and gave him a net worth of $120 million. ==Early life and education== Phillips was born in Oakland, California in 1921. His mother, Sunshine, was a gold prospector in California. His family was poor, and Phillips worked various jobs as a youth, including serving as a guide on Treasure Island during the San Francisco World's Fair. He suffered from polio as a young man and recovered in his early 20s. Phillips graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in paleontology. His studies had been interrupted by World War II, in which Phillips served in the Merchant Marine before returning to college. Also during his college years, Phillips participated in fossil-hunting expeditions to Arizona, Oregon, and Utah, and corresponded with archaeologist William F. Albright, who later accompanied Phillips on his first archaeology expedition. ==Archaeology career== ===African expedition=== In the late 1940s, Phillips acquired funding from the University of California to organize a broad archaeological exploration of Africa. Though Phillips was inexperienced as an archaeologist, his used his charisma and persuasion skills to lead a team of approximately 50 scholars and technicians, equipped with trucks and an airplane. The expedition lasted 26 months and covered the entire length of the continent between Egypt and South Africa, receiving significant publicity in the United States. A highlight of the expedition's findings were jaws and teeth of a hominid from the Swartkrans site in South Africa. ===First Yemen expedition=== Phillips's next expedition was in 1951 to the Arabian peninsula. Planning for this expedition began with a 1949 meeting between Phillips and Ahmad bin Yahya Hamidaddin, then King of Yemen, who suggested to Phillips that he explore a region of modern-day Yemen. The Imam's recommendation was further reinforced in meetings that Phillips had with Arabist St John Philby and with Charles Inge who was then Director of Antiquities for the Crown Colony of Aden. These conversations culminated in Phillips leading a journey to explore the ancient city of Timna. This region is historically significant because of its role in the incense trade route. As preparation for the Yemeni expedition, Phillips conducted a two-week aerial reconnaissance of the Arabian peninsula. Ancient city of alt= The expedition to Yemen was smaller and more tightly organized than Phillips's African trip. It included William F. Albright as chief archaeologist. In addition to Timna, the expedition also focused on excavation of Ma'rib, believed to be the capital of the Sabaʾ empire, historically identified with the biblical Queen of Sheba. At Timna, Phillips's team excavated through layers of strata, allowing them to develop a timeline of the city dating to the 8th century BCE. An excavation at the House Yafash uncovered twin bronze lions and an alabaster figurine referred to by the team as \\"Miriam\\". The excavation also uncovered many utilitarian objects from daily life and funerary objects from a cemetery at Timna. One of the excavation sites was the Circular Moon Temple, dating to approximately 800 BCE. Part of the expedition took place at a pre-Islamic site called Hajar bin Humeid, where excavation reached layers of strata from the 11th century BCE. Also noteworthy from the 1951 endeavors was the discovery of ancient masonry marks on paving stones providing instructions for builders. This find served as a key to the language of the ancient inhabitants. Also included was epigraphist Albert Jamme who contributed significantly to understanding the language and developing the timeline of the ancient people of the region. Jamme compiled his findings in a treatise Sabaean Inscriptions From Mahram Bilqis (Marib), which included a foreword by Phillips. Excavations included the Marib Dam, which was the largest of ancient times, and the Awwam Temple, which was one of the most important temples of the Sabean people, in use 1,200 years before the emergence of Islam. The team developed a detailed description of the temple, including its size and materials of construction, and determined that the temple was reconstructed at least once during these pre-Islamic times. They discovered many inscriptions within these structures that provided insight into the pre-Islamic religion of the region. The expedition team also found a Hellenistic influence in certain of the statues in the temple. Example of a Qataban bronze lion found in the House Yafash However, the expedition was interrupted by raids by Bedouin warriors. The size of the project, the taking of artifacts, and the lack of familiarity of the local people with foreigners caused suspicion from locals, with some viewing Phillips's expedition as an invasion. Early in the project, Phillips was briefly taken prisoner by the locals. By early 1952, the hostility was enough to end the project, and the region has remained closed to archaeologists since that time. ===Other expeditions=== Phillips's expeditions in the Middle East extended through most of the 1950s and into the early 1960s, emphasizing the Dhofar Province. In 1960, Phillips led another expedition to the region to excavate three locations dating to pre-Islamic times. The expedition yielded more artifacts, inscriptions, and further insight into the pre-Islamic history of the region. One member of the team, Ray L. Cleveland, wrote that \\"sedentary occupation of any importance came rather late to this region of Arabia.\\" During the course of his expeditions, Phillips and his teams microfilmed more than two million pages of documented history of the region at St. Catherine's Monastery. As a result of the expedition, Phillips was able to detail a timeline of Arabian history, which is archived at the United States Library of Congress. ===Public image=== Phillips was known to be concerned with his public image in the United States and elsewhere. He brought cameras on his expeditions to provide publicity photographs and movies of his exploits. He held international press conferences and sent telegrams to the president of the United States. At times, he carried Colt .45 caliber pistols on his waist and staffed his expeditions on occasion with attractive women. In these ways, Phillips nurtured an exotic and celebrated reputation while maintaining high productivity of his expeditions. ==Oil career== During his 1951 expedition to modern-day Yemen, Phillips became acquainted with the Sultan of Oman, who was impressed with his skills as a salesman. The sultan believed Phillips could be useful for exploiting the region's oil reserves and granted Phillips the mineral rights to a modest oil producing region of his country. The sultan also granted him two offshore oil concessions, copper mining rights, and offshore fishing rights, which Phillips began to parlay into his Middle East American Oil Company in 1954. Phillips traded some of his original concessions for more profitable mineral rights in Venezuela, Indonesia, and elsewhere. By 1955, Phillips also completed an arrangement with King Idris of Libya to acquire oil rights in that nation. By 1975, Phillips was the largest individual holder of oil concessions in the world, with a net worth in 1975 United States dollars of $120 million. ==Later years and death== Phillips died of heart disease at a hospital in Arlington, Virginia, on December 4, 1975. In his last years, he lived in a penthouse apartment in Waikiki, Hawaii, from which he managed his oil enterprises. == Writings == Phillips authored several books. Qataban and Sheba: Exploring the Ancient Kingdoms on the Biblical Spice Routes of Arabia, was named to the American Library Association's list of 50 Best Books of 1955. In 1958, Phillips published an autobiography, Sheba's Buried City (Qataban and Sheba), in which he credits his mother for instilling his interest in exploration. Unknown Oman is an account of his 1958 expedition to Oman. ==Legacy== As of 2015, Phillips was the only United States citizen ever to be named a Bedouin sheikh of the Bal-Harith tribe. He was a member of the Dutch Treat Club, and fellow member Lowell Thomas gave Phillips his nickname of \\"America's Lawrence of Arabia\\", after illustrious British adventurer T.E. Lawrence. He was a 1972 Golden Plate Awardee of the Academy of Achievement. Phillips is considered to be a real-life model for the fictional film character known as Indiana Jones. Phillips's sister Merilyn Phillips Hodgson manages his collection of archaeological artifacts through the American Foundation for the Study of Man. In 1998, by invitation of the Yemen government, the American Foundation for the Study of Man returned to Yemen for archaeological purposes, this time under the leadership of Hodgson. The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution displayed artifacts from Phillips's expeditions and details of his life in an exhibition that ran from 2014 to 2015. The Sackler Gallery described the exhibit as being the first \\"multi-sensory\\" exhibition in that it included artifacts, films clips and videos, field notebooks, and vintage photographs. Phillips's flamboyant style and methods sometimes resulted in controversy. One scholar, Carl Lamberg- Karlovsky, described Phillips's excavations as \\"looting\\". Members of Phillips's own teams at times complained about his emphasis on style. In contrast, Sackler Gallery scholar Julian Raby described Phillips as an example of \\"entrepreneurial archaeology\\", being typical of the era in which Phillips was active. This characteristic, together with his organizational skills and fund-raising skills, were aspects of his expeditions that resulted in significant findings of enduring value. ==References== ==External links== *American Foundation for the Study of Man *The BBC produced a 2014 documentary film about Phillips including actual footage of his expeditions. *A description of Phillips's oil holdings, emphasizing those in Korea, is maintained by the University of Utah library.

Moinuddin graduated from Rajkumar College, Rajkot.Who's Who in India, Burma & Ceylon (Who's Who Publishers (India) Limited, 1936), p. 541 ==Reign== Khanji ascended the throne of Manavadar on 19 October 1918 after the death of his father. Since he was only seven years old, his mother acted as Regent until 1931, when 20-year-old Khanji's investiture took place. Following the independence and partition of India in 1947, the princely states were invited to either join India or Pakistan or remain independent. On 24 September, Khanji acceded to the new Dominion of Pakistan. However, on the orders of the Deputy Prime Minister of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India annexed the state on 22 October. A referendum was held in Manavadar, Mangrol, and three other states. Out of 31,434 votes which were cast, 34 were in favour of Pakistan. Khanji was initially put under house arrest at Songadh and later arrested at Rajkot. In 1951, he left for Pakistan following the Liaquat–Nehru Pact.Vidya Dhar Mahajan, Fifty Years of Modern India: 1919-1969 (S. Chand & Co., 1970), pp. 327–328 ==Sportsman== Khanji was the founder of the Manavadar hockey team coached by Mirza Nasiruddin Masood. Under his captaincy (?), the team toured New Zealand and won all the matches in 1934. In the same year, he was a member of the India hockey team representing the country at the Western Asiatic Games. Khanji also played cricket and represented Western India in the Ranji Trophy between 1935 and 1941. After migrating to Pakistan, he became the president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation. ==Personal life== Khanji married his first wife Qudsia Siddiqa Begum, daughter of the Nawab of Kurwai on 14 November 1933. He married for a second time in July 1945 to Nawab Abida Begum. He had five sons and six daughters, the last of whom was born in 1963. His eldest son Aslam Khan was also a cricketer. One of Khanji's grand-daughters, Sarwat Gilani, is an actress. Khanji's full name, with titles, was Major Nawab Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji Fatehuddin Khanji Babi, Khan Sahib of Manavadar. He received the Hilal-e-Quaid-i-Azam in 1953. Khanji died on 13 February 2003 at the age of 92 at Karachi, Sindh province. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Indian monarchs Category:Muslim monarchs Category:Pakistani people of Gujarati descent Category:Indian cricketers Category:Western India cricketers Category:Indian male field hockey players Category:Prisoners and detainees of India Category:Pakistani sports executives and administrators ","title":"Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji"},{"id":"60417403","text":"Alex Chappell ( Corddry) (born October 10, 1988) is an American journalist for Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) covering the Washington Nationals.

He founded ByteDance in 2012 and developed the news aggregator Toutiao and the video sharing platform TikTok (Douyin/抖音), formerly known as Musical.ly. As of 2019, with more than 1 billion monthly users, ByteDance is valued at US$75 billion, making it the most valuable startup in the world. Zhang's personal wealth is estimated at $22.6 billion, making him the ninth richest person in China. == Early life and career == Zhang was born in 1 April 1983. In 2001, he enrolled at Nankai University in Tianjin, where he majored in microelectronics before changing to software engineering, and graduated in 2005. He met his wife at university. In February 2006, Zhang became the fifth employee and the first engineer at the travel website Kuxun (), and was promoted to technical director a year later. In 2008, Zhang left Kuxun to work for Microsoft, but felt stifled by the corporate rules of the company. He soon left Microsoft to join the startup Fanfou (), which eventually failed. In 2009, when Kuxun was about to be acquired by Expedia, Zhang took over Kuxun's real estate search business and started 99fang.com (), his first company. == ByteDance == In 2011, Zhang noticed the user migration from computers to smartphones. He hired a professional manager to take over as CEO of 99fang, and quit the company to start ByteDance in 2012. Zhang thought that Chinese smartphone users were struggling to find information in mobile apps available in 2012 and the search giant Baidu was mixing search results with undisclosed advertising. His vision was to push relevant content to users using recommendations generated by artificial intelligence. This vision, however, was not shared by most venture capitalists, and he failed to secure funding until Susquehanna International Group agreed to invest in the startup. In August 2012, ByteDance launched the Toutiao news app and within two years attracted more than 13 million daily users. Sequoia Capital, which rejected Zhang the first time, came around and led a US$100 million investment in the company in 2014. In September 2015, ByteDance launched its video sharing app TikTok (known as Douyin in China) with little fanfare. The product was an instant hit with millennials and became popular worldwide. ByteDance bought Musical.ly a year later for US$800 million and integrated it into TikTok. ByteDance's first app, Neihan Duanzi, was shut down in 2018 by the National Radio and Television Administration. In response, Zhang issued an apology stating that the app was \\"incommensurate with socialist core values\\", that it had a \\"weak\\" implementation of Xi Jinping Thought, and promised that ByteDance would \\"further deepen cooperation\\" with the ruling Chinese Communist Party to better promote its policies. As of late 2018, with more than 1 billion monthly users across its mobile apps, ByteDance is valued at US$75 billion, surpassing Uber to become the most valuable startup in the world. Zhang's personal wealth is estimated at $22.6 billion, making him the 9th richest person in China. In September 2020, the United States Department of Justice referred to Zhang as a \\"mouthpiece\\" of the Chinese Communist Party in a legal filing. == Honours and recognition == Zhang was named in the 2013 China 30 Under 30 list by Forbes. In 2018, he was included in Fortune magazine's 40 Under 40 list. Zhang was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019. == References == Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century Chinese businesspeople Category:ByteDance people Category:Chinese billionaires Category:Chinese computer businesspeople Category:Chinese software engineers Category:Chinese technology company founders Category:Microsoft people Category:Nankai University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Fujian Category:People from Longyan Category:Billionaires from Fujian ","title":"Zhang Yiming"},{"id":"60417423","text":"During the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Donald Trump refused to release his tax return information, breaking a forty-year precedent of candidates for the presidency doing so. The controversy surrounding Trump's tax returns continued through his presidency, with numerous political and legal conflicts occurring between Trump and those attempting to obtain them. In September 2020, The New York Times obtained, and reported upon, more than two decades of data from Trump's personal and business tax returns. The records show that Trump paid no income taxes in ten of the preceding fifteen years, largely because he reported far more losses than gains; that Trump is engaged in long-running, and ongoing, audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over the legitimacy of a $72.9million tax refund claimed by Trump after declaring massive losses; and that Trump personally guaranteed $421million in debt, much of which is coming due in the next several years. Prior to and during his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to release his tax returns, but then reneged on his pledge to do so. Trump became the first major-party presidential nominee and president since 1976 to refuse to release his tax returns to the public. Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed he cannot make his returns public while they are under audit. Trump has engaged in a lengthy legal battle to keep his tax returns secret. In May 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee subpoenaed the IRS for six years of Trump's returns, with which the Trump administration refused to comply, leading to a lawsuit to enforce the subpoena. Separately, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Trump's accounting firm for tax records and other records as part of an investigation into Trump's conduct, which Trump sued to block. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the validity of the subpoenas. In late August 2019, a New York state grand jury issued a subpoena to Trump seeking eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns, as part of an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, including a hush-money payment made during the 2016 presidential election campaign and potential tax fraud. Trump refused to comply, contending that a sitting president enjoys \\"absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind.\\" In October 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled against Trump and ordered him to comply with the subpoena; this ruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in November 2019. Trump appealed the decisions against him to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2020, in Trump v. Vance, the Court rejected Trump's broadest claims, holding that the president lacks absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas, and ruling that the subpoena must be further examined for validity by the lower courts. In a separate decision in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, the Court ruled that the lower courts should further assess the congressional subpoena. In response to Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, California enacted legislation to require presidential candidates to release tax returns to be allowed on the primary election ballot. This law was later found to violate the state's constitution by the California Supreme Court. Separately, in New York, a state law was passed which would permit the state tax officials to release state tax returns to specific congressional committees upon request for legitimate purposes. ==Contents of returns== ===Partial leaks=== While complete returns spanning multiple years have not been released by Trump, fragments of information about Trump's taxes leaked at multiple times prior to 2020. In 2016, the Washington Post reported a prior audit of Trump's tax returns for 2002 through 2008 by the IRS which was \\"closed administratively by agreement with the I.R.S. without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency.\\" The audit centered on a potential failure to report cancelled debts as income by Trump, and whether Trump performed a stock-for-debt swap. Some tax attorneys speculate the government may ultimately have reduced what Trump was able to claim as a loss without requiring him to pay any additional taxes. It is unknown whether the IRS challenged Trump's use of the stock-for-debt swap, which is a maneuver with questionable legality. Congress had previously banned equity for debt swaps by corporations in 1993, and by partnerships such as Trump's in 2004. In a separate leak, parts of Trump's 1995 and 2005 tax returns were examined by multiple news organizations. The New York Times examined three pages of Trump's 1995 return in October 2016, and found in that year Trump declared a net operating loss of more than $500million. Under section 172 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 this gave Trump a $915.7million tax exemption. This reduction in tax liability was allowed to be carried over to offset income for up to eighteen years after it was originally claimed. Later, in March 2017, journalist David Cay Johnston obtained the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns, which were given to Rachel Maddow and shown on MSNBC. These pages showed Trump's gross adjusted income to be $150million and showed he paid $38million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of these documents. In 2019, the New York Times obtained partial information from transcripts of Trump's IRS Form 1040 (the main federal tax form) spanning 1985 to 1994. The records show that Trump lost $1.17billion over that period, with the amount more than \\"nearly any other individual American taxpayer\\" during that time. The information showed Trump claimed those losses to avoid tax liability in eight of those years. Trump himself has acknowledged the tax advantages inherent in the real estate business, such as large write-offs from using depreciation of property to generate losses and reduce tax liabilities. However, the Times reported that \\"depreciation cannot account for the hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.\\" ===2020 New York Times reporting=== On September 27, 2020, the New York Times published a report on more than two decades of Trump's tax-return data, including information from 2017 and 2018, his first two years in office. The Times obtained the data earlier that month. The documents contradict many of Trump's public claims to have a flourishing and prosperous business empire, showing that as a result of reporting losses in many years and receiving a $72.9million tax refund, Trump paid no net federal income taxes in eleven of the preceding fifteen years. After the refund, Trump had an average tax bill of $1.4million per year over the 18 years. In 2016, Trump paid only $750 in federal income tax, and in 2017, he paid another $750 in federal income tax. This was much less than other recent presidents paid while in office. His immediate two predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush routinely paid $100,000 annually in federal income tax, and sometimes far more. In 2017, Trump's pre-credit tax liability was $7,435,857. All but $750 of this amount was negated by carried-over tax credits, of which he had $22.7million at the time. It is unclear why Trump chose not to cancel out his federal income tax liability completely. The data do not reveal Trump's net worth. Tax-return data largely lacks specifics allowing for financial connections to be identified, and the data does not reveal any previously unknown connections to Russia. In the twenty years examined by the Times, Trump engaged in tax avoidance to a far greater extent than most affluent Americans (the top 0.001% of tax filers). Due to this avoidance, Trump paid \\"about $400million less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year.\\" While in many years Trump ended with little or no tax liability, there is no evidence he ever failed to file a tax return, or file for an extension and pay his expected tax burden by the annual filing deadline, even if such payments were later refunded when the returns were completed. Over two decades, Trump's golf courses and other businesses regularly lost significant amounts of money, which is one way Trump was able to reduce his tax liability. For example, in 2018 Trump reported $47.4million in losses, and since 2000, Trump reported total losses of $315.6million from his golf courses alone. While Trump had significant income in many years, including from The Apprentice, he placed millions of dollars into his businesses which recorded losses for the year. Many of these businesses also claimed significant non-cash losses for the \\"depreciation\\" of the properties owned, but this cannot account for the entirety of the losses Trump claimed on his returns. The Trump Tower in New York is one of the few businesses he owns that turns an annual profit, but Trump still appears to owe the \\"full $100million\\" mortgage which will come due in 2022. Trump's $72.9 million tax refund covering multiple years of paid taxes is currently under audit by the IRS. The audit began in 2011 and has not been resolved as of 2020. In the event the IRS determines the refund was improper, Trump would be required to repay more than $100million, which includes interest on the amount. Trump has also personally guaranteed $421million in debt, most of which is due within four years. Trump previously expressed regret that he had personally guaranteed debt during the 1980s which brought him close to personal bankruptcy when his businesses faltered in the early 1990s. The debt coming due and Trump's financial situation could, if Trump were re-elected, place his creditors in the \\"unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president\\". The bulk of the debt came from Trump's struggling Doral golf resort ($125million) and the Washington D.C. Trump International Hotel ($160million). Trump also had debt forgiven amounting to \\"far more money than previously known: a total of $287million since 2010\\". Debt which has been forgiven is supposed to be treated as income, but he used tax provisions to avoid or defer reporting it as such. The Times notes that multiple potential violations of tax rules are present in the refunds examined. This includes the payment of \\"consulting fees\\" to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump while she was a top executive at the Trump Organization, which was used to reduce Trump's tax liability. Overall, Trump's companies appeared to claim 20% of their income was used for \\"consulting fees\\"which do not need to be explained further but can be written off as business expenses. Trump also appears to have aggressively classified personal-lifestyle related expenses as business expenses in order to write them off and reduce his liability. This includes at least $70,000 used for haircuts (some during the production of The Apprentice), as well as more than $100,000 to a makeup artist and hair stylist favored by Ivanka Trump. In many years Trump also classified payments for his aircraft and its support as business expenses. Trump also classified Seven Springs, his estate in Bedford, New York, as an \\"investment property\\" in order to write off $2.2million in property taxes, even though the family uses it as a personal retreat. Over the years examined, Trump reported receiving $73million in revenue from outside the United States, including some from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian rulers. He was also paid more than $8.7million by the multilevel marketing company ACN Inc., which was accused of defrauding vulnerable consumers. Trump shot promotional videos for the company, which was accused of consumer fraud in a lawsuit filed in 2018. The Times reported that Trump's financial condition at the time he announced his presidential candidacy in 2015 \\"lends some credence to the notion that his long-shot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name\\". ===Responses and analysis=== Trump dismissed the Times report, responding with a blend of denials and justifications. He criticized what he called the \\"bad intent\\" of the report, but did not dispute the facts behind it. He also contended that the tax authorities had mistreated him. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's indebtedness raises concerns about national security, since it represents \\"over $400million in leverage that somebody has over the president of the United States\\" and it is not known to whom the debt is owed. ==History of controversy== ===Before 2016=== In 1999, while Trump was considering whether to run for president under the Reform Party, he said \\"probably wouldn't have a problem with\\" releasing his tax returns if he ran. In April 2011, Trump said that when President Barack Obama produces \\"his birth certificate... I'd love to give my tax returns.\\" Obama's birth certificate was released a week later, resulting in Trump's saying his tax returns would be released \\"at the appropriate time\\". In 2012, Trump implored for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's tax returns to be released on April 1, which \\"historically is the time that everybody gives them\\". That year, Trump also said that not seeing a presidential candidate's tax returns would lead people to think there was \\"almost, like, something wrong. What's wrong?\\" According to Trump's former political adviser Sam Nunberg said in 2013 and 2014 that Trump had considered the possibility of releasing his tax returns as part of a presidential campaign, believing that showing how little he paid in taxes would make him appear to be a savvy businessman. Nunberg said by November 2014, he had persuaded Trump to reverse course and withhold his tax returns, as Trump decided he \\"wanted to look rich rather than smart\\". In May 2014, Trump said in an interview: \\"If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that.\\" ===2016 campaign=== In February 2015, Trump said he would release tax returns if he ran for president. On another occasion that month, he declared: \\"I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns.\\" Later in February 2015, Trump warned: \\"I will tell you upfront... I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person\\". In May 2016, Trump voiced similar sentiments, stating he tries \\"very hard to pay as little tax as possible\\". However, Trump has in 2015 criticized corporate executives and \\"hedge fund guys\\" for paying zero or negligible taxes. He also alleged in 2011 and 2012 that half of all Americans do not pay income taxes, stating: \\"it's a problem,\\" while noting \\"crippling\\" government debt. Trump also in 2012 criticized President Barack Obama for \\"only\\" paying a tax rate of around 20%. Trump announced his candidacy for President in June 2015. In January 2016, Trump was asked by Chuck Todd if he would release his tax returns, to which Trump answered: \\"we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely. [...] at the appropriate time, you'll be very satisfied.\\" In February 2016, Trump said he would release his tax returns \\"[p]robably over the next few months. They're being worked on now.\\" Later that month, Trump falsely claimed that he could not release his tax returns because he was under audit. However, nothing prevents a taxpayer from releasing his own tax returns; the IRS has confirmed that individuals are free to share their own tax information. Every president from Richard Nixon onward has voluntarily released his tax returns annually, and the IRS automatically (since the 1970s) audits the tax returns of presidents and vice presidents. In May 2016, Trump said he would not release his tax returns before the November 2016 election.. Trump also said in May 2016 that \\"there's nothing to learn from\\" his tax returns, and said on ABC News that his tax rate is \\"none of your business\\". Trump's refusal broke with tradition, as all major presidential nominees from 1976 onward have released their tax returns. Trump was criticized for his refusal to release tax information. Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called Trump's refusal \\"disqualifying\\" and said the only logical reason for Trump was that \\"there is a bombshell in them.\\" John Fund of the National Review feared that the returns contained an electoral \\"time bomb\\" and called upon Republican convention delegates to abstain from voting for Trump if he did not release the information. During the presidential debates, Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for not disclosing his tax returns, saying that only \\"a couple of years\\" of Trump's tax returns were publicly available, \\"and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\\" Trump responded: \\"That makes me smart.\\" Clinton went on to suggest that Trump might not have \\"paid any federal income tax for a lot of years\\"; Trump responding by saying that the taxes he paid \\"would be squandered\\" by the government. ===After 2016=== As president, Trump continued to withhold his tax returns. In May 2017, Trump said he \\"might\\" release his tax returns only after he had stepped down as president. This was in spite of his previous commitment made during his campaign to release his tax returns once they were not under audit. ====Tax March protests==== In January 2017, an online petition on the \\"We the People\\" portion of the White House's website calling for the release of Trump's tax returns was set up. The petition gained more than a million signatures, becoming the most signed petition on the White House's website. However, the White House gave no official response to the petition as of April 2017. Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway then said that \\"The White House response is that he's not going to release the tax returns\\" and that \\"people didn't care\\" about Trump's tax returns. In response, Jennifer Taub and others planned the Tax March on April 15, 2017 (Tax Day) to demand that Trump release his tax returns; tens of thousands of people marched in New York and dozens of cities across the country. ==Subpoenas and investigations== ===House Ways and Means Committee=== After winning control of the House in the 2018 elections, House Democrats signaled their intent to use their new power to demand Trump's tax returns in the new Congress, which convened in January 2019. On April3, 2019, the chairman of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, Congressman Richard Neal, formally requested six years (2013 through 2018) of Trump's returns. The request was made in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig with a deadline seven days later. Neal again wrote to Rettig on April 13, setting a second deadline of April 23 and writing that a failure to meet the deadline would be \\"interpreted as a denial\\". Under a 1924 federal tax law, § 6103 of title 26 of the United States Code, Congress may request copies of anyone's tax returns. The treasury secretary is legally obliged to provide the tax returns, and there is no apparent legal mechanism to deny Congress's request. On April 5, 2019, Trump's personal lawyer William Consovoy wrote a letter to the United States Department of the Treasury (the parent agency of the IRS), claiming that the request for Trump's tax information is \\"not consistent with governing law\\" and Congress is trying to violate Trump's First Amendment rights. A 2018 draft IRS legal memo, the contents of which became public in 2019, concluded that the IRS must provide the requested tax returns to Congress unless Trump invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administration's justification for defying the earlier subpoena. On May 10, 2019, Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, issued a separate subpoena to the Treasury Department and the IRS for six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns and grant access by May 17. Neal said the committee aimed to obtain the tax records to evaluate \\"the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president\\". ===House Oversight and Reform Committee=== On April 15, 2019, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Representative Elijah Cummings, issued a subpoena to the accounting firm Mazars USA, LLP requesting tax records and other \\"financial documents concerning the President and his companies covering years both before and during his presidency.\\" Cummings identified four areas that the committee aimed to investigate through the subpoena: (1) whether Trump \\"may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office\\"; (2) whether Trump \\"has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions\\"; (3) whether Trump was complying with the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause and Domestic Emoluments Clause; and (4) whether Trump \\"has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities.\\" ===Failure to comply=== The Trump administration refused to comply with the subpoenas. On May 6, 2019, after weeks of delay, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sent a letter to House Ways and Means Committee chair Neal, asserting that the subpoena lacked \\"a legitimate legislative purpose\\" and that \\"the department may not lawfully fulfill the committee's request,\\" although the IRS had released Richard Nixon's tax returns the same day Congress requested them in 1973. The Trump's administration's Justice Department, through a memo written by Office of Legal Counsel head Steven Engel, issued an opinion supporting Mnuchin's refusal to release Trump's tax returns. This triggered a legal battle between the administration and Congress. Neal criticized the administration's position, saying that its objections \\"lack merit\\" and \\"judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee's request.\\" On April 7, 2019, Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting White House chief of staff, said Trump's tax returns will \\"never\\" be released. Trump and Mulvaney have argued that voters have no interest in Trump's tax returns and that the issue had been \\"litigated\\" when Trump was elected. On May 7, 2019, The New York Times revealed that it had acquired information about Trump's tax returns showing more than a billion dollars in business losses with a decade in the red. In April 2019, a Trump adviser speaking on condition of anonymity told Fox News that Trump has repeatedly questioned his aides about the status of the congressional request, and also asked about the \\"loyalty\\" of top IRS officials. Trump appointee Michael J. Desmond, who as Chief Counsel of the IRS and Assistant General Counsel in the Department of the Treasury is responsible for giving legal advice to the IRS commissioner, previously served as a tax advisor to the Trump Organization and also worked alongside two other longtime tax advisors to the Trump Organization. According to The New York Times, on February 5, 2019, Trump asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to speed up Desmond's confirmation and indicating that confirming Desmond was a higher priority to him than confirming William Barr for Attorney General. Trump and his White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, said Trump would not release his tax returns while they are under audit, although nothing precludes a person from releasing tax returns that are under audit, a fact reaffirmed by IRS Commissioner Rettig. Sanders also opined that Congress is not \\"smart enough\\" to examine Trump's tax returns, although ten members of Congress are accountants, including three Certified Public Accountants. On April 10, Trump made a partially false statement that \\"there's no law whatsoever\\" requiring him to provide Congress his tax returns. While there is no law requiring Trump to publicly release his tax returns, federal law of IRS Code section 6103(f) does require Trump's (or anyone else's) tax returns to be given to Congress if they request it. ===Interference with IRS audit=== On July 29, 2019, a career IRS official filed a whistleblower complaint with the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, stating that at least one Treasury Department official had inappropriately interfered in the audit process for the tax returns of the president and vice president, which takes place annually in accordance with IRS policy. The possibility that political appointees interfered with audits conducted by career civil servants alarmed former IRS officials and legal experts. Due to stringent laws regarding disclosure of tax information, the details of the complaint have not been made public. However, Representative Richard E. Neal, the Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in September 2019 that he was consulting legal counsel on whether the whistleblower's complaint could be publicly released.. The whistleblower's report was referred to by Neal and other House Democrats in the federal lawsuit regarding Trump's refusal to comply with a House Ways and Means Committee subpoena for the returns; in a filing, Neal wrote that the whistleblower's complaint presents credible evidence of potential inappropriate efforts to influence \\"the mandatory audit program\\" and raises \\"serious and urgent concerns\\", thereby bolstering the committee's case for obtaining the tax returns. ==Lawsuits== ===Committee on Ways & Means v. U.S. Department of the Treasury and Trump=== On May 17, 2019, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin again refused to hand over the records subpoenaed by the House Committee on Ways and Means. On July 2, 2019, the Committee on Ways and Means sued Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Rettig to enforce the subpoena and obtain six years of Trump's tax returns. The suit is pending before U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Trump was added to the case as an intervenor. In September 2019, a bipartisan group of six former general counsels to the House of Representatives filed an amicus brief in the case, urging the court to reject Trump's claims that the House lacks standing to bring the case. In January 2020, the judge stayed proceedings in the case, pending the resolution of the In re McGahn case by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. ===Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP=== On May 20, 2019, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, refused a request by Trump's attorneys to quash the subpoena from the House Oversight Committee directed to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA LLP, ruling that the subpoena must be complied with.; aff'd The district court held that the subpoena was well within Congress's broad investigative powers and rejected Trump's claim that the subpoena to Mazars was \\"a usurpation of an exclusively executive or judicial function.\\" Trump then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which heard oral argument on July 12, 2019, and then issued a ruling against Trump on October 11, 2019. In its 2–1 ruling, the court of appeals upheld the lower court's ruling, holding that \\"contrary to the President's arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena\\" for eight years of tax returns to Mazars, and that Mazars therefore \\"must comply\\" with the subpoena. The 66-page majority opinion was written by Judge David S. Tatel, joined by Patricia A. Millett; Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, dissented. Trump's motion for rehearing en banc (i.e., before the entire D.C. Circuit) was denied on November 13, 2019, on an 8–3 vote. The ruling was the second appeals court decision within ten days against Trump regarding release of his tax returns. Trump subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, asking the Court to review the case. On December 13, 2019, the Supreme Court decided to review both the Trump v. Mazars US, LLP case (Supreme Court No.19-715) and the Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG case (Supreme Court No.19-760). The court consolidated them and indicated that they would be set for oral argument sometime in March 2020. The Second Circuit's mandate was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in the case. The Court's decision in the case is believed to be a likely landmark ruling on how far presidents may resist subpoenas or other demands for information from the Congress and from prosecutors. On July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its 7–2 ruling, vacating the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanding the case for further review. This made it unlikely that the Trumps' taxes would be released before the election and the end of both his term and those of the 116th Congress. On July 20, 2020, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order denying a motion by House Democrats to expedite the litigation in lower courts; the order reduced the likelihood that congressional investigators would obtain the tax records before the November election. Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that she would have granted the motion. ===Trump v. Vance=== In late August 2019, soon after opening an investigation into hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, the Manhattan district attorney's office issued a subpoena to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for eight years of Trump's individual tax returns and corporate tax records for the Trump Organization. The existence of the subpoena was first reported by the New York Times in September 2019. The Times reported in August 2020 that in 2019 the district attorney had also subpoenaed Trump's primary bank, Deutsche Bank, which complied with financial statements and other records Trump had provided as he sought loans from the bank. Citing grand jury secrecy rules, the Manhattan D.A.'s office, led by Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has not revealed the scope of the investigation, but in court filings proescutors have stated that publicly available evidence regarding the conduct of Trump and his businesses would justify a grand jury investigation into tax fraud and financial crimes such as insurance fraud, falsification of business records, and other crimes. Trump sought to quash the subpoena in federal court, contending that a sitting president enjoys \\"absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind\\". In court filings in September 2019, New York prosecutors rejected Trump's claim of \\"sweeping immunity\\" from a criminal probe while he is in office, writing that Trump was \\"seeking to invent and enforce a new presidential 'tax return privilege', on the theory that disclosing information in a tax return will necessarily reveal information that will somehow impede the functioning of a President, sufficiently to meet the test of irreparable harm.\\" On October 7, 2019, Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected Trump's effort to prevent his tax returns from being turned over to the New York grand jury, and ordered Trump to comply with a subpoena. In a 75-page opinion, the court called Trump's contention an overreach of executive power that is \\"repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values\\". Enforcement of the subpoena was temporarily delayed pending consideration by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Later the same month, oral argument before the Second Circuit took place before a three-judge panel of Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann, Judge Denny Chin, and Judge Christopher F. Droney. Trump's private lawyer, William S. Consovoy, argued that a president enjoyed absolute \\"presidential immunity\\" from all investigation and criminal process while in office; responding to a hypothetical from the court, Consovoy said the president should be shielded even if he hypothetically committed murder on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In response, counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office told the court \\"there is no such thing as presidential immunity for tax returns\\" and noted that tax returns are frequently subpoenaed in financial investigations. On November 4, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit ruled unanimously that Mazars must comply with the subpoena and hand over eight years of Trump's tax returns. The court held that the president is not immune from \\"the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the President\\" and that a state grand jury may permissibly issue subpoenas \\"in aid of its investigation of potential crimes committed by persons within its jurisdiction, even if that investigation may in some way implicate the President\\". Noting that \\"the President concedes that his immunity lasts only so long as he holds office and that he could therefore be prosecuted after leaving office,\\" the Second Circuit ruled that there \\"is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a President during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office.\\" Trump subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, asserting that the grand-jury subpoena directed to him violates Article II and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. In December 2019, the Court agreed to hear the appeal. After oral arguments were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the case was argued on May 12, 2020. On July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its 7–2 ruling, holding (in an opinion written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.) that \\"ArticleII and the supremacy clause of the Constitution do not categorically preclude, or require a heightened standard for, the issuance of a state criminal subpoena to a sitting president.\\" Roberts wrote: \\"No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.\\" The court thus rejected Trump's claim that he was absolute immunity from the New York grand jury criminal subpoenas, but allowed Trump to return to the lower court to make a different argument for withholding his returns, such as scope or relevance. On remand, Trump's attorneys then argued that the subpoena was \\"wildly overbroad\\" and issued in bad faith. On August 20, 2020, Judge Marrero rejected this argument, ordering that the tax returns be turned over to prosecutors. Trump's attorneys immediately requested an emergency stay, which Marrero denied. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a stay to Trump on September 1, 2020, and oral argument before that court was held on September 25, 2020. During the hearing, the three judges appeared skeptical of Trump's central argument that the subpoena constituted an overbroad \\"fishing expedition.\\" On October 7, 2020, the Court ruled in favor of Vance. However, given an agreement between the parties in which Trump has an additional twelve days to ask the Supreme Court for another stay, it remains unknown when the Manhattan District Attorney's office will obtain the tax records. Trump requested the Supreme Court stay on October 13. ==State law reactions== ===California primary election law=== On July 30, 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom signed the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act (S.B. 27), a law requiring candidates for president and California governor, as a condition for gaining California ballot access, to release their most recent five years of federal tax returns at least 98 days ahead of the primary election (which would be November 26, 2019, for the 2020 primaries, since the California primary is on March 3, 2020). Trump immediately sued the State of California, seeking to block implementation of the law, asserting that the law is unconstitutional. On September 19, 2019, U.S. District Judge Morrison C. England issued a temporary injunction blocking the law from taking effect. California appealed; California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said: \\"Our elected leaders have a legal and moral obligation to be transparent with voters about potential conflicts of interest. This law is fundamental to preserving and protecting American democracy.\\" In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed California's appeal of the federal district court decision as moot, in light of the California Supreme Court's decision (see below). The law was separately challenged in state court, and in November 2019, the California Supreme Court unanimously invalidated the law, meaning that Trump will not have to release his tax returns to get on the primary ballot in California in 2020. Chief Justice Tani Gorre Cantil-Sakauye wrote that \\"The Legislature may well be correct that a presidential candidate's income tax returns could provide California voters with important information\\" but that the requirement to release the returns conflicted with the California Constitution's \\"specification of an inclusive open presidential primary ballot\\". ===New York State TRUST Act=== In May 2019, the New York State Senate passed the TRUST Act which would amend state law to permit the commissioner of the state Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return requested by the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation for any \\"specific and legitimate legislative purpose.\\" The New York State Assembly approved the bill on May 22, sending it to the governor. On July8 Governor Andrew M. Cuomo signed the bill. Trump sued the State and the House Ways and Means Committee fifteen days later to block release of the tax returns. In November 2019, Trump's suit was dismissed on personal jurisdiction grounds. ==Notes== ==See also== *Fred Trump#Wealth and death *Wealth of Donald Trump ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:United States tax law Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election Tax returns ","title":"Tax returns of Donald Trump"},{"id":"60417436","text":"Hotel Wilber is a historic hotel in Wilber, Nebraska.

She is known for her graphic novel Cuba: My Revolution (illustrated by Dean Haspiel), a fictionalized memoir of her life prior to coming to the United States. == Biography == Inverna Lockpez was born in Havana, Cuba Growing up, Lockpez yearned to be an artist although her mother wanted her to follow behind her father’s footsteps as a doctor. However, in 1959, after Fidel Castro overthrows previous Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, Lockpez decided to set aside art and pursue a career in medical studies in order to help Castro’s militia as a doctor. During the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, Lockpez volunteers as a medic to go to the front-lines to help the Cubans fight the Americans. There, Lockpez helped an injured CIA prisoner and is arrested for conspiracy. While in prison, Lockpez is tortured repeatedly by her own comrades. After three months, Lockpez is released from prison and begins to focus on art once again. On September 1965, Lockpez’s art exhibition was opened to the public, however, riots started to form because her art did not fall under the category approved by Fidel Castro. Lockpez’s artwork was confiscated and she was forced to hide. After receiving her travel visa, Lockpez left Cuba in September, 1966 and arrived in the United States. After settling in New York, Lockpez attended the School of Social Work at Columbia University. In 1969, she attended her first exhibition in the United States: the Woodstock Music Festival. This influenced her to exhibit her own art in the 1970 all-female art exhibition “X12.” Shortly after, Lockpez joined the NYC Women Artists in Revolution, an organization that protests against museums and galleries that do not portray female artists in their exhibitions and shows. During the 1970s, Lockpez primarily focused on sculptures, and in 1972, her 25-foot sculpture “Walking Pineapples” won the outdoor competition of The Municipal Art Society. However, her artwork was met with much controversy because New York at the time was mainly influenced by minimalist and conceptual art. In 1978, she became the director of INTAR Gallery, NYC, which focused on exhibiting the work of artists with multiracial heritages. She attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and studied film, video, and computer graphics. Her art reflected themes of ecology and the welfare of the environment. In 1985, Lockpez began her series “Markings of the Land” after she moved to a farmhouse in Delaware County. Her art was mainly black and white and its artistic features were of mountains and animal iconography. From 1982 to 1993, Lockpez curated or produced a series of feminist art exhibits in New York City; her most prominent being the 1993 portfolio for Heresies, issue #27. In 1988, Lockpez assumed role of President for the National Association of Artists’ Organizations (NAAO). Years later, in 2001, she became the director of the Catskill Center’s Erpf Gallery in Arkville and in 2008, Lockpez wrote a novel of her experiences from her time in Cuba. In 2010, Cuba: My Revolution was published by DC Comics/Vertigo, documenting her struggles from her time during the Cuban Revolution until her eventual coming to America. Currently, Lockpez lives in Florida and is working on her new series of works, entitled Avian Impressions and The Boat Run. == Education == Lockpez attended medical school at the University of Havana, then she studied painting and sculpture at the National Academy of San Alejandro. Afterwards, she studied printmaking at Taller de Grabado. Lockpez attended the School of Social Work at Columbia University once she came to the United States and later in the 1980s, she attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. == Artworks == Ms. Lockpez exhibited a 15-foot sculpture, titled Ms. in New York City in 1973. This was the first time the word \\"Ms.\\" was used as a title for a woman in a public exhibition. Lockpez displayed this artwork at the political show titled Women Choose Women in order to demonstrate the artwork woman artists are able to create. Walking Pineapples For the 1974 CESP project, Lockpez created a foam board sculpture titled \\"Walking Pineapples.\\" Lockpez's project was a three-curved shaped structure of graduated height. Each was segmented into black-outlined parts of tropical oranges, yellows, pinks, and greens, with addition three-dimensional shapes. The curve of the sculpture and counter-curve gave the ensemble the look of a pineapple. Lockpez used urethane foam blocks, laminated polyester, and fiberglass sheeting to create her 25-foot sculpture. To complete the entire sculpture, Lockpez spent $6,800 on materials. Untitled Lockpez's 1975, Untitled, features a three-dimensional paper and foam sculpture of what seems to be a volcano. It is a black-and- white visual art that portrays the volcano separating into three different parts, representing the different types of rocks that are found during an volcanic explosion. The Green Barn Lockpez completed her oil on canvas painting in 2000. It features a dark green barn with a dark green tree to its left, in a snowy setting. The dark color of the barn and tree contrasts with the white snow, which gives the artwork a blurry, but grandiose accomplishment. This painting was featured in Lockpez's 2008 gallery titled The Noble Barn. == Exhibitions == In 1976, she exhibited several 12-foot, three-dimensional works in the first feminist exhibition titled X12. The exhibition group later merged with the NYC Women Artists in Revolution, a group which organized demonstrations against museums and galleries that did not exhibit the work of female artists. Lockpez also participated in multiple political shows. The first one she was involved in was The Flag Show, an anti- Vietnam show at the Judson Memorial Church. She was also a part of Women Choose Women, in which she displayed her art, \\"Ms.\\" The MOD ART at the Public Theater in New York City was in part with one of the first feminist music plays, and in 1981, Lockpez also took part in directing the controversial play: My Sister in This House. The last political show she was involved in was the Erotic Garden at the Women's interart Center in New York in which artists reclaimed their sexuality in visual terms.Torruella, Leval S, Ricardo Pau- Llosa, and Inverna Lockpez.

The X12 group's work was exhibited under the title \\"Spaces\\" at the Museum of Modern Art and they put out experimental exhibitions at Gain Ground. In 2007, the remaining X12 were asked to put together a show for a historical review of feminist art called WACK! at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Lockpez was a curator from 1982-1993 and she also helped publish many books on the exhibitions she curated. In 1984, she curated Lydia Cabrera: An Intimate Portrait which was the first retrospective on the life and work of the Afro- Cuban culture. Following, she co-published Chicano Expressions: A New View in American Art in 1986. This was the first comprehensive exhibition of Chicano art in the Northeast. In 1988, Lopez curated Autobiography: In Her Own Image, which was a prospective of Latin, African, Asian and Native American sensibilities. Besides curating artwork, Lockpez started her own gallery of different art. Her gallery,The Noble Barn, was published in 2008 and it features New York's Catskill landscape through natural and architectural form. In addition to the paintings, there are interviews and essays about the vanishing lifestyle of farm families. Her most recent galleries are The Last Barn and Rural Roadscapes. The galleries are both mainly oil on canvas paintings and it features vivid colors with a heavy use of white. She is currently working on her two newest galleries, Avian Impressions and The Boat Run. Similarly, in The Boat Run, most of the artworks features different shapes and sizes of boats, while using vivid colors on the boat to contrast the dark colors of the sea. == Publications == In 2010, Lockpez decided to write about her early life in the form of a graphic novel. It was published by DC Comics/Vertigo.

Mertel followed his father's profession, becoming a dyer of indigo cloth.

Redecker landed at Walvis Bay on May 15, 1867, as one of the Rhenish Missionaries joining Carl Hugo Hahn to settle the area. He settled first in Omaruru and later in Otjimbingwe, but when the latter mission closed in 1874, he stayed behind as a merchant through the decade and likely beyond, running a store in town. According to other sources, Redecker lived in South West Africa as a colonial merchant for the Wupperthal Trading Company, established by the RMS. In 1870, this company was renamed the Missions- Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft (MHAG, Mission Trading Company), with branches in Otjimbingwe, Walvis Bay, Okahandja, and Rehoboth, among others. The company had to dissolve in 1880, following severe losses amid the Nama-Herero war. Redecker and Eduard Hälbich, both of whom were based in South West Africa, subsequently plied their trade as independent merchants and wagon-makers. Redecker was married twice: on March 31, 1869 to Lina Gronemeyer of Gütersloh, where their children also attended school, and later in 1885 to Anna Maria Husemann. Between both marriages, eight children were born. Among the children's caretakers was Johanna Gertze, who on July 25, 1858, was the first Herero to be baptized. == Sources == * (af) De Kock, W.J. 1968. Suid- Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek, vol.

Its successor is the Nissan NP200. It was first manufactured by Rosslyn Motor Assemblers, which later became Nissan South Africa. == Model history == The vehicle with the internal designation B120 was sold worldwide in 1971 as Datsun 1200 and was based on the Model B110. It had a payload of more than half a ton. In 1976, the Datsun 1200 was renamed 120 Y. At the same time, production started in South Africa. The model bore the internal designation B121 from 1979 onwards and B122 from 1981, while the larger engined variant available only in South Africa was given the number B140. The B120 was sold in Australia until 1985 and produced in Japan until 1994. The model in South Africa received a 1.4-liter engine (code A14) in 1980 (or 1984) and was renamed to Datsun 1400 and 1982 respectively to Nissan 1400. In 1985, the Nissan 1400 received a 75 mm higher cab roof and front disc brakes. At about the same time, local (South African) parts content had reached 100 percent. The facelift also included the conversion to rectangular headlights and black instead of chrome bumper. A sport model of the 1400 Bakkie was marketed as the Champ. This model had appropriate side striping, bucket seats, a tachometer, and central handbrake. This vehicle had two popular local nicknames, either 1400 or kanniedood which, translated from Afrikaans, means \\"cannot die\\", a testament to its reliability. The 1400 Bakkie was assembled by Nissan in Rosslyn, South Africa (Nissan). Another assembly location for the model was the AYMESA plant in Quito, Ecuador which assembled it under the Datsun brand name as the 1200 PickUp. Further facelifts took place in 2002 and 2005. Later models of the Nissan 1400 had a five-speed gearbox. Essential technical aspects such as engine with carburetor, leaf springs and rear-wheel drive remained unchanged throughout the construction period. The Nissan 1400 was regarded as a reference of this class in South Africa and was also nicknamed \\"Champion of Africa\\". The production, which was discontinued due to stricter emission and safety regulations, ended with 150 copies of the Heritage Edition. == References == 1400 Category:Cars of South Africa Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Pickup trucks Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:2000s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1971 ","title":"Nissan 1400"},{"id":"60417750","text":"Draconarius is a genus of Asian funnel weavers first described by S.

artist specializing in photography, sculpting, painting, and jewelry as art. Her artwork focuses on American and Abstract art which led her to have her art portrayed in many art galleries and private collections around the world. == Biography == Marcia Grostein was born in Sāo Paulo, Brazil in 1948 and currently resides in New York. Her parents are of Jewish descent; her father is Polish and her mother is Russian, who immigrated to Brazil. Grostein's family are spread all around different parts of Latin America after WWII. She has traveled around the world displaying her art in solo and group exhibitions, which are still being shown in different galleries. She has been mentored by many great artists who have helped her portrayed her work, one in particular was Willem de Kooning and James Rosenquist who helped her in the art scene. She is a contemporary Latin American artist whose work is portrayed by the story of her life, in which much of her art is difficult to understand since it is cerebral. Her artwork does not have clear description; it is up to interpretation by the viewer to understand the art since it is based in expression. She has been awarded many awards based on her artwork which made her the first Brazilian artist to sell her work in a high-end art gallery. Most of her art is based on a series; some is portrayed with photographs, sculptures, jewelry, and more. Her artwork is also in many different countries whether it is shown in photographs or actual sculptures in these other countries. Grostein's artwork is seen to be very abstract compared to many other artists in the twentieth century, since most of her art is depicted in many forms. She has studied in various countries and combined both cultures into her artwork by travelling to many countries and portraying her artwork herself in these different backgrounds around Latin America. In the institutes where Grostein studied, she experimented with different types of art which led her to her main focus on American Art. == Education == Grostein studied in Sāo Paulo at the Instituto de Arte e Decoraçāo (1963–1966) and continued at the Royal Academy of Art in London (1969–1970). == Artwork == === The Sacred Garden of Eve (1989) === Colorful painting under the Sacred Garden collection (37\\" x 72\\") Description: A four- piece of colorful artwork of a garden curled up in different layers of color starting with circled flowers in the bottom to green grass at the top with a type of peacock in the middle. This artwork was based on a series Grostein had done based on imaginary gardens; she expressed all of this in another artwork named The Sacred Garden of Adam. This art series was based on oil paintings depicting these sacred gardens which are meant to be interpreted by the viewer. The painting is currently held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. === The Sacred Garden of Adam (1988) === Oil on canvas under the Sacred Garden collection (78\\" x 60\\") Description: The exhibit opens with “The Sacred Gardens,” more specifically with “The Sacred Garden of Adam,” of 1988 (we still do not know if it will be able to leave the Metropolitan Museum in New York). In it are synthesized three central entities: land, man and sea, where the emblematic figure of the monkey, a primordial animal, merges with the solidarity image of the artist at the center of her exterior and interior life, in the face of four possibilities of movement and of choice, but at the mercy of her own destiny, There virtuality is a plunge into the waters of time, a leap toward the trees and the flowers of the day, a walk to obscure lands of twisted tropical night vines and finally, rest in contemplation of the landscape. The invisible diagram which holds up the canvas is a mandala, an image of the world with the four cardinal points. In one way or another all the works in “The Scared Garden” have this quality and it is for this reason that it is at the beginning of the mysteries of the journey.Leirner, Sheila, and Brooks Adams. Marcia Grostein: Forma Selvagem: 20 Anos De Percurso. Museu De Arte De São Paulo Assis Chateaubriand, 1994. The monkey represents Adam. Grostein's evocation of Eden is no mere biblical allegory. Darwin has invaded the scene in the person of the monkey, an alleged evolutionary ancestor of humankind. And Freud haunts the symbolism of the flower as representing the first bloom of female sexuality which lies in wait, ready for the picking/fulfillment. === 'They.Went.For.A.Swim' === Large High Sculpture Description: A sculpture taken on the beach and is a tall black and brown rustic circle. This was a series depicted on the beach with many different sculptures Grostein had made and photographed. In this series she had three different sculptures, and it was shown in many different views based on the photographs. Some of these sculptures had wave-like features as well as some of the other art was portrayed as the coral of the ocean. === Portable Art === Part of the jewelry collection Description: A piece of jewelry around the neck with a silver metal band and two clear plastic-like ornaments at the end with a small gold band at the end. This gives a description of art is found in everything and is shown with the different shapes along the jewelry. === Alice in Wonderland === Description: This piece is one of Grostein's photography photos of a young woman dancing ballet on a stage with an ankle-length pink fluffy dress. She has her back turned around with her body tilted a little and a spotlight shining on her with a water-like background. This artwork is part of series of a dance performance from a young woman dancing and showing her different stance of each move and photograph shown. The photographs have a very depicted view of the dancer with the dim lights shown to portray her focus on the artist themselves during her performance. === Sky drawings: sǎo paulo biennial === Large String-Like Shapes Description: This is a set of artwork of long different shaped metal strips reaching the sky and the photographs are angled towards the sky. This angled shows the shapes angled all above the sky and bringing the sky drawing to life. Sky Drawings was an artwork series depicted on many different countries in showing strips of art in the sky. This artwork was shown as a public form of art showing the nature from the background of these different countries. The art was merely similar, but the scenery was shown to give it more meaning depending on the time of day as well as the locations of where this series took place. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * 1988: Academia and Museo Dioscano d'Arte Sacra (Venice, Italy) * 1985: 19 Biennal (Sāo Paulo, Brazil) \\"7 Continents\\" * 1983: Betty Parsons Gallery, (New York) * 1981: Institute for Art and Urban Resources, P.S.1, (L.I.

He argued that \\"[i]f we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further, making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing black people today.\\" In this vein, he highlighted mass incarceration and high homicide victimization rates as problems affecting black Americans today. He suggested an alternate proposal of paying reparations to black Americans who personally grew up under Jim Crow.

(1920) with Yukio Aoyama and Lois Wilson California Motion Picture Corporation was a film company based in San Rafael, California, in Marin County during the silent film era. The company lasted from 1914 until January 1916 when it went bankrupt. It was subsequently renamed and lasted until 1920. It produced at least 15 films. The film company is known for its feature-length films about early California history. The Marin Library has a digital collection related to the studio. Their productions included Salomy Jane (1914), Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (1914), Mignon (1915), and Who's Your Servant? (1920). Frank Erlanger was one of the actors who worked for the studio. Salomy Jane survives in its entirety. George E. Middleton was a director with the studio and Beatriz Michelena a leading actress. Harold Entwistle and William Nigh also directed films for the company. An announcement of the company's incorporation gives a San Francisco main office address at 356 Pune Street and lists the board of directors as: James Woods, manager of the St. Francis Hotel; Baldwin Wood, attorney; Charles Payne, President Payne Real Estate Company; Thomas B. Eastland, President Coast Realty Co.; A. M. Johnson, Attorney; and Robin Y. Hayne, Capitalist as well as officer from a steamship company and Pacific Telephonen and Telegraph. It was billed as the largest film company in the west. ==History== Stage actress Michelena married George E. Middleton, a prominent San Francisco automobile dealer, on Sunday, March 3, 1907. The private wedding took place at 232 Divisadero Street, the home of the parents of bridesmaid Margaret McGovern, \\"a lifelong friend of the bride\\". The couple spent a few weeks in Los Angeles for their honeymoon. Middleton was the manager of the local Middleton Motor Car Company and the son of a California timber baron. He introduced Michelena to his society friends and business partners, including the trustees of Charles Crocker's estate who had rebuilt the St. Francis Hotel after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Middleton set up the California Motion Picture Company in San Rafael in 1912 for the purpose of shooting promotional footage of the automobiles he was selling. He determined that his pretty wife could star in movies made by his company. By 1914, Middleton and Michelena were making three major films at the same time. During the shooting of Salomy Jane, Michelena posed for a publicity still with leading man House Peters. The first feature completed by CMPC was Salomy Jane, screened initially at the St. Francis Hotel by invitation only. Michelena's role was Bret Harte's Salomy Jane Clay, an energetic daughter of an emigrant miner. She is wooed by four men but prefers a fifth played by British heartthrob House Peters. The movie saw limited nationwide distribution and was judged a hit by viewers who were impressed by the wild California scenery: giant redwood trees, winding roads hugging rocky bluffs and the Russian River Michelena's dominant portrayal of the title role was also an appeal. Journalist Josephine Clifford McCracken wrote of her in the June 1915 issue of Overland Monthly: Michelena and actor Andrew Robson in The Lily of Poverty Flat One CMPC shooting location was on family property near Boulder Creek, California, where Middleton's father had established a timber holding now known as the Middleton Tract. (Obituary for brother of George E. Middleton) Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective. Even though Salomy Jane did not return a profit (likely due to second-string distribution channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton that his wife could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford, and almost all CMPC movies had her as their star. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given until the end of the year to be completed. Faust was not done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released. Middleton and Michelena bought the bankrupt film company for \\"a few thousand dollars\\" in 1917 and renamed it Michelena Studios. Their new company was called Beatriz Michelena Features, and shooting began on their next feature-length film, Just Squaw. Michelena's lead character was a white woman raised by American Indians, a woman who does not realize her racial heritage until after she falls into forbidden love with a white man. The movie played for only a week in San Francisco in 1919, and did not return a profit. The moviemakers' new distributor, Robertson-Cole, was unable to find the right market for Heart of Juanita and The Flame of Hellgate in 1920. American audiences had grown more sophisticated, yet Michelena Studios was still employing their earlier production techniques. After shooting The Flame of Hellgate, Middleton and Michelena stopped making movies altogether. She returned to her singing performances and he returned to his car sales. They reportedly divorced in the mid-1920s, though Middleton told the 1930 US Census that they were married.1930; Census Place: San Rafael, Marin, California; Roll: 176; Page: 10A; Enumeration District: 0020; Image: 981.0; FHL microfilm: 2339911.

Their opening ceremony usually starts on Saturday, preceding the Epiphany’s Sunday and is presided by Vaval, accompanied by the Queen and the Prince of Almire. The carnival begins with Vaval at the head of the first parade of the Carnival and ends with his death on a pyre at sunset on the Ash Wednesday. \\"Born to die, Vaval, King of Carnival embodies the time of the perpetual renewal and the strength of the present.\\" == Representation == Made from vegetal elements such as wood, straw or reeds, Vaval appears under various traits whether there are human traits or animal traits. When he takes the form of a human, he can be represented as corpulent, or thin, sometimes as laughing but others as resigned. Because he is the King of the Carnival, he is displaying an extravagant phallus. Depending on the collective imagination, he can come from the sky, waters or even the woods == Meaning == === Religious === The religious meaning behind the creation of the Carnival is, above all, a characteristic of the French Guyana. This festivity is seen as belonging to the Devil, as opposed to the Christian festivities. During the Carnival, it is said that all hell rises to Earth and demons come up to take Vaval to his death because he is a sinner. Here is all the ambiguity coming with the symbolic of the King of Carnival because while the festivities are authorized, they also are a celebration of what Satan represents. The pyre's flames on which Vaval dies, are a reminder for the population of the ones burning in Hell and of what they might expect, at the time of their own death, if they sin. === Political === Through the King of the Carnival, the population can publicly, once a year, express its opposition to the authorities without being punished for it. He helps regulate the relationship and the balance of power between the people and the public authorities. His repeated appearance and death are means to bring an end to political and social conflicts without any act of violence. \\"The politics revives annually under the sacrificial form of a liberating death.\\" === Social === Besides having a religious and political meaning, Vaval, the King, also has a social meaning: he represents the public disorder, specific to festivities such as the Carnival. All the things, typical to public disorder like the disguises, the excesses (sexual or alcohol), the criticism, the mockery and the shift from a \\"normal\\" to an \\"absurd\\" social life, are merged into one entity that is Vaval, the King of the Carnival. This figure is also the personification of all the social wrongs (diseases, collective misfortune, etc.) that have happened during the past year, thus, the necessity for his death. == Death == It is on the Ash Wednesday, day of grief, that the King Vaval is destined to die. He has to die in order to revive the following year. On that day, a big funeral parade takes place to pay him tribute and everybody has to wear black and white. Groups of mourners and of prayers compound this parade. The type of death depends on the « vidé » (parades), it goes from hanging, or cremation to drowning him. His death is extremely ritualized because through it, all the social wrongs and misfortunes disappear. His death is a means for the population to suppress any source of conflicts and thus, to reinforce their cohesion. On the other hand, the death of Vaval is beneficial also for the public authorities because it means that the social life is coming back to normal. Through his death, the public authorities demonstrate that they still have the power to eradicate any reason for disorder and therefore, still have the upper hand over the King of disorder. == References == Category:Carnival Category:Martinican culture Category:Guadeloupean culture Category:French Guianan culture ","title":"Vaval, the King of Carnival"},{"id":"60418074","text":"Emirler Archaeological Site and City Forest Museum () is a small museum located in Mersin Province, southern Turkey, exhibiting archaeological artifacts found at site and some fauna of the city forest. ==Location== The museum is next to Emirler village of Mersin Province at .Its distance to Mersin is about Google ==Museum== The Ministry of Forestry decided to establish a picnic area in the southern slopes of Toros Mountains where Mersin is in the view.

The type species is Iberodactylus andreui. ==History of discovery and naming== Map of the Los Quiñones site In the late 1980s, amateur paleontologist Javier Andreu at the Los Quiñones site, west of Obón in Aragón, discovered a pterosaur skull. At the time it represented the most complete discovery of pterosaur fossil material in Spain apart from the remains of Prejanopterus. In 2014, the find was reported in the scientific literature by José Antonio Ulloa-Rivas and identified as a member of the Ornithocheiroidea.Ulloa-Rivas, J.A. & Canudo, J.I. 2014. \\"New cranial remains of Ornithocheiroidea (Pterosauria) from the Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) of the Iberian Peninsula (Nuevos restos craneales de Ornithocheiroidea (Pterosauria) del Barremiense (Cretácico Inferior) de la Península Ibérica)\\". In: (Rodríguez, G.J.A. et alii, eds) New Insights on Ancient Life – XII Encuentro de Jóvenes Investigadores en Paleontología p 116–119 In 2019, the type species, Iberodactylus andreui, was named and described by Borja Holgado, Rodrigo Vargas Pêgas, José Ignacio Canudo, Josep Fortuny, Taissa Rodrigues, Julio Company and Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner. The generic name combines a reference to Iberia with a Greek δάκτυλος, daktylos, meaning \\"finger\\", a common suffix in the names of pterosaurs, since the naming of Pterodactylus. The specific name honors Andreu as discoverer. Because the name was published in an electronic publication, its validity requires Life Science Identifiers. These are 0174E98C-416B-4C49-AF63-2B42AF1E9EAB for the genus and 37FAC334-082A-4185-970E-7E7E13D5670C for the species.Borja Holgado, Rodrigo V. Pêgas, José Ignacio Canudo, Josep Fortuny, Taissa Rodrigues, Julio Company & Alexander W.A. Kellner, 2019, \\"On a new crested pterodactyloid from the Early Cretaceous of the Iberian Peninsula and the radiation of the clade Anhangueria\\", Scientific Reports 9: 4940 The holotype, MPZ-2014/1, was found in a chalkstone layer of the Blesa Formation dating from the Barremian. It consists of a partial front snout with crest, containing a number of broken teeth and empty tooth sockets. The fossil is part of the collection of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad de Zaragoza. ==Description== Snouts of Iberodactylus and Hamipterus ===Size and distinguishing traits=== The wingspan of Iberodactylus was estimated in 2019 by extrapolating the proportions of the related genus Hamipterus of which skull-wing ratios are known. The extrapolations indicated a wingspan that measured between . From this it was concluded that the paired wings were about wide. This would make Iberodactylus the largest pterosaur found in the Iberian peninsula up to 2019. The describing authors indicated two distinguishing traits. They are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The tip of the premaxilla is relatively tall. The crest on the premaxilla has a front edge curving to the front under an angle of about 80 degrees. ===Skull=== The fossil skull fragment has a preserved length of and a height of . The snout or rostrum is somewhat expanded at the front. The palate is keeled on the midline and turns upwards at the front. The snout bears a crest of which the base alone has been preserved. The front edge of the crest is positioned above the fifth tooth socket. The base of the crest is wide in side view, despite lacking its rear edge. The fracture in the fossil reveals that the bone wall is about thick, and the crest is filled with small bone struts called trabeculae. The crest is triangular in cross-section. Its sides are covered by vertical ridges and troughs. These run parallel to the forward curvature of the crest. Because the crest, a plausible display structure, is relatively robust, the authors assumed that the specimen represents a male individual. The fossil resembles Hamipterus but in that latter genus, the snout is lower and the front edge of the crest straighter. On the base of the edge small holes are visible. Their edges seem to be too sharp for them to be natural foramina in the bone wall. It was suggested that they could be tunnels made by bone-eating larvae of beetles. In 2014, it was assumed that they represented exit holes of a salt gland, unique for the entire Pterosauria. The maxilla bears at least eight conical teeth. The teeth have a elliptical cross-section. They are positioned more laterally on the jaw. The teeth increase in size until the third tooth, which with a width of is twice as wide as the first tooth. The fourth tooth becomes abruptly smaller and is about as large as the first. The fifth tooth is larger and the sixth is about as wide as the third. The seventh and eight teeth again abruptly decline in size, being somewhat smaller than the first one. ==Phylogeny== Iberodactylus was, within the Anhangueria, placed in the clade Hamipteridae, named in the same 2019 article. It was recovered as the sister species of Hamipterus. The close affinity with a Chinese form would prove that the Anhangueria originated from the east of Laurasia. Other early Cretaceous species from Iberia with close Asian relationships are Pelecanimimus, Concornis, Eoalulavis and Spinolestes.

He played for Manly-Warringah in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. ==Playing career== Bucknall made his first grade debut for Manly in 1969. In 1970, Manly reached the grand final against South Sydney. Bucknall played at second-row in the grand final and is best remembered for playing in this match. During the first half, Bucknall punched Souths captain John Sattler in the face during an off the ball incident breaking Sattler's jaw. Sattler then told teammate Mike Cleary \\"Hold me up so they don't know I'm hurt\\". Souths led the grand final at the half time break and it was only then that the Souths players learnt of Sattler's injury. In the second half, Bucknall was targeted by the South Sydney players and Manly went on to lose the grand final 23-12. Bucknall did not play any games for Manly in 1971 but returned to the side in 1972. Bucknall was not selected to play in Manly's maiden grand final victory over Eastern Suburbs. In 1973, Bucknall was selected to play for New South Wales against Queensland. Manly also reached their second grand final in a row after claiming the minor premiership in 1973. Bucknall played from the bench in the 1973 NSWRL grand final against Cronulla-Sutherland as the club won its second premiership defeating Cronulla 10-7 in a bruising final.

Sattler said that he had never spoken to Bucknall after the match even though in the years since Bucknall had wanted to apologize and declare a truce.

Another reviewer wrote about her controlled voice in all registers, rich in overtones and with exquisite legato, in dynamic flexibility and with freely floating top notes. A third reviewer described her \\"fluid delivery\\", with an \\"extraordinary projection of her brilliant high notes\\", and noted her intelligible diction in all registers, and her \\"ability to communicate a wide range of emotion\\", especially a \\"tender expressive quality\\". == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * Klaus Ulrich Spiegel: Brava, brava, bricconcella!

The character played the role of valet to both Captain Marvel and his teenaged alter-ego, Billy Batson, and was intended by Captain Marvel co-creator C.C. Beck to appeal to African- American readers. However, protests from African-Americans and other readers concerning Steamboat's racial stereotyping led to the character's disuse after 1945. ==Fictional character biography== Steamboat was an African-American food truck owner who helped Captain Marvel catch a gang of criminals in a park. By doing this, Steamboat's truck was destroyed. As a gesture of gratitude, Billy Batson gave Steamboat a job at WHIZ Radio in 1942. ==Reception== Steamboat appeared frequently as Billy Batson and Captain Marvel's sidekick between 1942 and 1945 in the Fawcett publications Whiz Comics, Captain Marvel Adventures, and America's Best Comics. His appearances include a handful of chapters of the classic Captain Marvel serialized \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" story arc in Captain Marvel Adventures #22-46. The character received a mostly negative reaction from African-American readers and civil rights groups. Steamboat was criticized for propagating offensive stereotypes of African-Americans, as he was depicted as being of low intelligence and speaking with a stereotypical Negro dialect. In 1945, an integrated group of junior high school students associated with the Youth Builders program met with Fawcett Comics' executive editor, Will Lieberman, and argued successfully for Steamboat's removal from the Captain Marvel comics stories. Following Captain Marvel Adventures #48 (Aug-Sept. 1945), Steamboat made no further appearances in Captain Marvel stories. The website Screenrant rated Steamboat the fourth-worst superhero sidekick of all time. ==References== Category:Comics characters introduced in 1942 Category:Fictional valets Category:Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Category:Stereotypes of African Americans Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional businesspeople ","title":"Steamboat (comics)"},{"id":"60418371","text":"Tippah Dwan (born 30 October 1999) is a professional Australian netball player.

It was constructed during the Peninsular War, forming part of the first of three defensive Lines of Torres Vedras aimed at protecting Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, from French invasion. The fort, which never saw battle, has been restored and can be visited. ==History== Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which agreed on the invasion of Portugal, French troops under the command of General Junot entered the country, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roliça and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese- British troops and forced to withdraw. However, the threat of further invasions by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napoléon Bonaparte's troops. The Lines of Torres Vedras, consisting of 152 forts, redoubts and other military installations, were built rapidly and in conditions of great secrecy, under the overall supervision of Colonel Richard Fletcher who was commander of the Royal Engineers. Located at the top of a small hill 227 meters high, the Fort of Arpim was built with the aim of linking the positions of the first defensive line, in the Calhandriz valley, to the second line that began at the Fort of Casa close to the River Tagus. Each of the works on the lines was given a number and Arpim was No. 125. It was to the rear of three other forts built at Calhandriz. In front of the four forts, the summit was scarped to make it inaccessible to the enemy. To defend the road that allowed access to Bucelas and Alverca do Ribatejo, Arpim also exchanged crossfire with three forts on the Aguieira mountain range and enjoyed a wide field of view, including of several other forts or redoubts of the second line such as the Fort of Zambujal and the Fort of Ribas. The Fort of Arpim had a seven-sided polygonal design and was surrounded by a trench or dry moat. It was made of packed earth reinforced with stone walls, and included a stone magazine and some structures in wood, such as gun emplacements, which facilitated movement of the artillery pieces. It was designed for a garrison of 250 soldiers and is believed to have been equipped with four cannon. Gun emplacements were pointed both in the direction of Calhandriz and the Aguieira hills. Of the 152 forts in the Lines, the Fort of Arpim was numbered 125 and was one of the last to be built. ==See also== *List of forts of the Lines of Torres Vedras ==References== ==External links== *Friends of the Lines of Torres Vedras * Arpim Category:Lines of Torres Vedras ","title":"Fort of Arpim"},{"id":"60418436","text":"Kolë Mirdita Helenau (Born January 24, 1900 – Dead 1936) was an Albanian drama director, poet and storyteller from Shkodër.

Antonio Bruti, (b. 1446), married Oria Kastrioti, cousin of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. Antonio Bruti fled to Lezhë and fathered a son named Barnabi, born in 1479, who later married Gioia Capelichio, part of one of the oldest Albanian families. They had two children, Antonio II Bruti (1515–1571) and Marco Bruti. Antonio II stayed in Ulcinj and married Maria Bruni, the daughter of Matteo Bruni, the former feudal lord of Shkoder. Antonio II was executed by hanging when the Turks occupied the city and arrested him. His sons, Marco and Giacobbe, returned to Koper after a bounty was put on their heads. In 1560, Antonio Bruti sent a petition from his home in Ulcinj listing the services he had performed. He also mentions in 1556 that there is a serious shortage of grain on Corfu (following the Sultans ban on exports). In 1559, Luigi Moncenigo mentions the family in a book about the families of Venice. The family had four archbishops; Pieter of Kotorr (1588), Antonio of Ulcinj, Gaicomon of Novigrad, (1671–1679) and Agostin in Koper. In 1611, Alessandro Bruti is mentioned in Capodistria. Agostino Kont de Bruti is mentioned in Koper and Venice and later in the service of the Douda and Cornari family in Venice. Giovanni and Antonio Bruti, as well as the Captains Marco and Cristofor Bruti are mentioned in a document referring to the re- opening of a cathedral with the bishop of Novigrad Giacomo Bruti in 1735. According to Giuseppe Bonzo, responsible for the burial of Agostino Kont de Bruti, Antonio Bruti fought in the war of More against the Turks in Corfus, was captured, survived and then returned and was honored with the title of Saint Stefan. In 1714, Count Barnabi Bruti ordered that the house of Bruti was to be built in Koper. The castle was finished by Giorgio Massari (1687–1766).

By the age of 16 he was already an established Hung Ga instructor in his own right and taught at his uncle's school Lam Sai-wing Martial Arts Association (林世榮國術團), and at Southern Martial Arts Athletic Association (南武體育會). In 1928, Lam Sai-wing took him to Hong Kong, where they opened two branches of Lam Sai-wing Martial Arts Association and Dit Da clinics there. Sai-wing managed the First Branch with Cho as chief instructor, while the Second Branch was managed by Cho's fellow student Dang Hin-choi. In 1931, Cho was invited to the British marine exercise event at Lufeng, Guangdong, to perform martial arts, and received praises from other participating martial artists. This was further reported on London Free Press. Later in about 1932, Cho taught his 8 year old adopted son Tang Kwok-wah (鄧國華) (1924–2011). Like his uncle, Lam Cho had since become one of the most celebrated martial artists, and was often sought after for his skills and was invited to many important martial arts events. In 1933, Cho took over the Second Branch and renamed it to Lam Cho Martial Arts Association (林祖國術社) with a new logo of Tiger and Crane insignia designed by his student Leung Wing- hang, replacing his uncle's former circular insignia logo which had Lam's Training Hall (林館) written inside of it. Thus the logo became a trademark of Lam Family Hung Kuen (林家洪拳) lineage. Lam married Tam Yeut-ming (譚月明) at Hong Kong and his first son was born in 1940, his son's name was named Lam Chun-fai (林鎮輝) by his uncle Sai-wing. During the World War II, Lam Cho was actively involved in the anti-Japanese resistance. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, civil disorder among the people broke out in the streets and Lam stepped in to maintain peace. He was later recognised by the Japanese as a man with considerable influence over the local people and they tried to have him becoming a member to the local administration. Lam's repeated refusal resulted him being a wanted man and his school being burned. Lam had no choice and fled back to his hometown Ping Chau village at Nanhai District, later he discreetly taught martial arts at San Jou village. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Lam moved his family back to Hong Kong and reopened his school and Dit Da clinic at the ground floor of the four storey building (present day Blue House) at Stone Nullah Lane in Wan Chai, the clinic where his uncle had presumably died in. There Lam trained his 5 year old first son Chun-fai along with others. Lam would often been invited by many associations and companies to act as their martial arts consultant. He also became the chairman of the Physical Culture Association. ==Personal life== Lam married Tam Yeut-ming (譚月明) and their children were born from during the World War II to post-war early 1950s, they have four sons, namely, Anthony Lam Chun-fai (林鎮輝) (born 1940), Lam Chun-hin (林鎮顯), Simon Lam Chun-chung (林鎮忠) (born 19 October 1948) and Lam Chun-sing (林鎮成) (born 1952), and two daughters, Lam Fung-chan (林鳳珍) and Lam Fung-chu (林鳳珠) (born 1944). All his six children were trained by him and were established Hung Ga and Dit Da practitioners. His son Anthony Lam would assist him as an instructor at the school before opening his own at North Point at the age of 18. In 1963, Lam left the school and Dit Da clinic at Wan Chai to be managed by his second son Lam Chun-hin and his wife Luk Lai- yin (陸麗燕) to open another training school and Dit Da clinic at Nullah Road, Mong Kok in Kowloon. Lam accepted the permission of his adopted son Tang Kwok- wah to open his own school in Hong Kong. Tang would later migrated to the United States in 1973 to open his school in Boston. Lam's fourth son Lam Chun- sing moved to Jordan to establish his own school and Dit Da clinic there for a year before ventured into business, but returned to Hong Kong in 1975 to train students at his father's studio in Mong Kok. Lam's wife Yeut-ming died in 1979. His second son Chun-hin died in the 1980s, Chun-hin's wife Luk carries on with the Dit Da practice at Wan Chai. ==Later life== Lam Cho's former martial arts school at Blue House in 2006. Currently known as Lam Chun-hin Clinic (林鎮顯醫館) by his late son Lam Chun-hin (林鎮顯) As well as his adopted son Tang, Lam's well-known senior students who eventually went overseas to promote Hung Ga were Kwong Tit Fu (鄺鐵夫; died 1999, Boston), Y.C. Wong (黃耀楨; San Francisco) and Buck Sam Kong (江北山; Kong's Siu Lum Pai Assn., Los Angeles). Although Lam officially retired in the 1970s, he continued to practice his martial arts and treated patients at Mong Kok on a regular basis with assistance of his youngest daughter Lam Fung-chu. In January 2008, Lam was invited to attend the Wong Fei-hung's 160th birthday anniversary commemorative ceremony in Nanhai as Hung Ga's most senior representative. Soon after his 100th lunar birthday in March 2010, Lam suffered a stroke and was taken to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital at Kowloon Tong. His training school and Dit Da clinic in Mong Kok had been taken over by his third son Simon Lam and youngest daughter respectively. Meanwhile, his adopted son Tang Kwok-wah died in Quincy on 22 November 2011. ==Death== Lam died during his stay at the hospital on 29 March 2012, 2:15 pm (UTC+08:00), at the ripe old age of 102. His funeral wake was held at Universal Funeral (世界殯儀館) at Hung Hom in April 2012, and his students from all over the world returned to Hong Kong to mourn for his passing.

She was awarded a place on the BBC Writer's Academy, a programme designed to train new writers for their long running television series, with her horror spec Camp Fear. She went on to write for all four of the BBC's popular continuing dramas: Doctors, Eastenders, Casualty and its spinoff, Holby City. She also wrote for Series 8 of Death in Paradise. ===The Coroner=== Abbott created The Coroner from an idea by Will Trotter, executive producer and head of BBC Drama Birmingham, about a woman coroner aged about 40 and in a location such as the Cotswolds or Devon. It starred Claire Goose as Jane Kennedy, a coroner based in a fictional South Devon coastal town. Matt Bardock stars as Detective Sergeant Davey Higgins. The series would have self-contained stories with drama and humour; a formula successfully used in Father Brown from the same production team. The characters, Jane and Davey, were based on Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in Adam's Rib with the unresolved sexual tension between them. Abbott wrote the Davey character with Matt Bardock in mind. She created four other characters to complete the cast.

The work has been described by Jo-Anne Green, as engaging \\"with media saturation and its subsequent devaluation of information; copyright — who actually owns the information, the event that triggered it, the history it becomes?; is it the ‘truth’?\\" The source material of the work was \\"headline news articles parsed from http://news.bbc.co.uk/ between 29.12.2003 and 01.02.2004 from which samples of audio, image, text, and video information were extracted.\\". === [FALLUJAH . IRAQ . 31/03/2004] === The work concerns events that occurred when four American mercenaries were ambushed and shot or beaten to death by Iraqi insurgents. The source material employed in creating the work included censored AP source footage from www.thememoryhole.org and public domain news articles from www.bbc.co.uk. The work was exhibited at FILE: Internacional Electronic Language Festival and in Turbulence Artist Studios. It was selected by Gustav Metzger for EASTinternational 05. === Encoded Presence [auto-portrait of E. Puente] === Encoded Presence [auto-portrait of E. Puente] was one of twenty finalists for the inaugural Noka/Darklight Pocket Movies Challenge in 2005. The work concerned the \\"re-purposing of the mobile phone from a mundane communication device to a cinematic instrument\\". Encoded Presence [auto-portrait of E. Puente] also appeared in Pocket Films: Festival international de films réalisés avec téléphone mobile at the Centre Pompidou in 2007. === re_collection === Magruder's work, re_collection was included in the December 2005 exhibition at Lumen Eclipse, which is a public media arts gallery located in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The work was recommended to curator Ryan Hovenweep by Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green of Turbulence.org. On Magruder's website, he describes how the work consists of a person \\"recorded without direction utilising only a SVP c500 smartphone as a cinematic device. From the resulting material a single 14 second audio/video stream was extracted and used (with only minor editing/manipulation) as the exclusive source material for the artwork.\\" The exhibition in which the work appeared was reviewed by Cate McQuaid for the Boston Globe. In her comments about re_collection she said that Magruder, \\"cleverly utilizes the hallmarks of his medium to disorient: He pixelates the image, a grassy landscape, into a bright, clunky grid.\\" === {Transcription} === {Transcription} was first exhibited at the Courtauld Institute of Art. Magruder's website describes the work as \\"a real-time media installation, specifically created for the [Courtauld] Institute’s back six-level staircase. Consisting of dynamic audio/visual structures intermixed with static wall- drawn elements, the work reflects upon society's data-driven and information-saturated existence through the examination of international news communications\\". Prof. Gegory Sporton has described the subject of the work in terms of \\"[t]echnology's role as a gauze through which we view the world\\". === PRISM === Magruder was commissioned by Headlong, a UK-based theatre company, to create PRISM in 2014. The work was a new media installation that reflected on a production by Headlong of a new adaptation created by Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan of the novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, by George Orwell. PRISM is described as reflecting on Edward Snowden and the information about \\"a portfolio of clandestine mass surveillance programs on a scale reminiscent of George Orwell’s dystopian society of 1984\\" that he brought to public attention. Headlong also commissioned a second work: The Nether Realm, which was a living virtual world inspired by the play, The Nether, by Jennifer Haley. === A New Jerusalem === A New Jerusalem was first exhibited as part of the De/coding the Apocalypse exhibition at Somerset House in London, England. The work was created by Michael Takeo Magruder with Prof. Edward Adams and Drew Baker and won the Lumen Prize Immersive Environment Award in 2015. The piece is based upon the narrative of the Book of Revelation. In 2018, the work was included in the exhibition And I Will Take You to Paradise at Art Museum KUBE, Norway. === Lamentation for the Forsaken === Lamentation for the Forsaken was commissioned for the exhibition, Stations of the Cross, which took place in Lent, 2016. The work is described as a \\"new media installation that juxtaposes Christ’s suffering and journey to the cross with the anguish and plight of refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War\\". The work was situated in St Stephen Walbrook as one of the fourteen locations across London in which the Stations of the Cross exhibition took place to \\"tell the story of the Passion in a new way, for people of different faiths\\". Revd. Jonathan Evens, Priest-in-charge at St Stephen Walbrook, has commented on the synergy of the church with the work in relation to matters such as lamentation and the refugee crisis. Magruder is reported as having stated that \\"his practice is not in any way a religious endeavor — even with artworks like Lamentation for the Forsaken that explicitly reference a Christian narrative\\". The exhibition transferred to Washington D.C. and New York City in the United States. In the exhibition in New York City, Lamentation for the Forsaken was located at \\"Station Six (Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus) at New York’s Church of the Heavenly Rest on 5th Ave and 90th street\\". The work was subsequently situated in the Chapel of the Resurrection Christ Church Cranbrook, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, USA. Prof. Aaron Rosen has described the work as “a lamentation not only for the forsaken Christ, but others who have felt his acute pain of abandonment”. == Selected exhibitions == === (in)Remembrance [11-M] === In 2010, Magruder was commissioned to create (in)Remembrance [11-M] for Manifesta 8: the European Biennial of Contemporary Art. The project was a series of interrelated works that engaged with the train bombings in Madrid, Spain in 2004. (in)Remembrance [11-M] was installed at Museo Regional de Arte Moderno (MURAM) in Cartagena, Spain. In his book, Aesthetic Journalism: How to Inform Without Informing, Alfredo Cramerotti has described how Magruder \\"undertakes journalistic investigations by sourcing third-person material to build a highly individualized narrative of the facts reported.\\" Magruder has described (in)Remembrance [11-M] as a project more than an exhibition in an art gallery. === Living Data === 'Living Data' was a solo touring exhibition that included works generated from the \\"vast and ever-changing sea of collective data that underpins our everyday existence,\\" and engaged with the way in which real-time digital technology is generated by and then has an impact on the material world. The exhibition included the following works of art: Data_cosm; Data_plex (babel); Data_plex (economy); Data_Sea; Data Flower (prototype I); Data Storm (prototype I); and Data.Record [BBC_2010.08.17@16:26GMT]. === De/coding the Apocalypse === 'De/coding the Apocalypse' was a solo exhibition that concerned the Book of Revelation. The Revd. Jonathan Evens has commented that, \\"[t]he word 'apocalypse' originally indicated an 'unveiling,' and the exhibition investigates our enduring fascination with this seminal biblical text, updating and investigating its aspects\\". 'De/coding the Apocalypse' was the culmination of an interdisciplinary collaboration supported by the Cultural Institute at King's College London, which combined Magruder's art practice with academic research in the Department of Theology & Religious Studies at King's College London in partnership with the contemporary art centre, MOSTYN. Magruder collaborated with Professor Ben Quash (Theology, King's College London) and Alfredo Cramerotti, Director of MOSTYN. The exhibition included digital media installations, which used a variety of digital technologies, including mobile devices and computers as well as tangible art composed of physical materials. Michael Takeo Magruder was the Centre for the Critical Study of Apocalyptic and Millenarian Movements ('CenSAMM') Artist in Residence for the conference, 'Apocalypse in Art: The Creative Unveiling'. During his residency he installed \\"De/coding the Apocalypse\\" at the Panacea Museum in Bedford, England. == References == == Further reading == * Jo-Anne Green (2012) Parsing Truths.

He was the son of Mustafa Aga, who derived from Durrës, and was one of the first to settle in Bar after the Ottoman conquest in 1571. Selim Begu Mustafa fought against the Montenegrins and ruled with the Bosnian-Albanian nobility against the Porte. == Life and death == Mustafa Begu managed to maintain power by bribing his friends in Constantinople. Over the years, relations between Montenegro and Turkey worsened resulting in the Montenegrins occupying Žabljak on Lake Shkodër (Skadar lake). The Ottoman-Albanian irregulars, under Selim Begu, countered them. In 1851, he was appointed commander of the forces in Bar and received money from the Albanians of Mirdita. Fighting with the Montenegrins continued in 1852, and in order to stand out as a commander, Begu attacked Godinje. The attack was countered by the Montenegrins and Selim had to return to Bar eager for revenge. Eventually he occupied Godinje and then attacked the Martinic- tribe and occupied the Ostroski monastery. There they were attacked by a large Montenegrin force and were forced tot retreat with many dead and wounded. The loss led to a quarrel between Selim Begu and the commander of Diber, Abdurahman-Beg. On June 27, 1851, Selim Begu was in the local bazar when a killing, out of sacrilegious reasons, occurred. These types of happening worsened relations between Christians and Muslims but under Selim Begus rule the Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims lived in peace and preferred Selim Begus rule over Prince Nikola who later seized the city. Selim Begu had large ambitions and was criticized by Abdurahamn-Beg for thinking that he was ”Mahmut Pasha Bushatliu”. Selim Begu continued to work on strengthening the city walls and fixing the border to Montenegro which Ahmet Dzevdet, an Ottoman commander, had commenced. After Omer Pasha Lata visited Montenegro, the situation was calmed. However, in Krnjići, in 1862, a sharp clash between Albanians and Montenegrins occurred. In order to secure his safety, Selim Begu built a high wall around his palace in Darzhak. He also called for the Catholic Albanians of Šušanjane. Afterwards, the bey heard of a rebellion in Hercegovina by Luka Vukalovic and decided to gather troops to march. The Ottomans landed with ships and men, led by Dilaver Bey, outside the fort of Nehaj. Selim Begu gathered the Muslim locals of Bar against the Montenegrins of Crmnica and Papani. The Montenegrins suffered 100 men. Despite his religious tolerance Selim Begu ruled with an iron fist making him unpopular and there were occasionally revolts against him. He would call for the local Albanians to help him. On November 13, 1877, Selim Begu was in Ulcinj when the Montenegrins attacked the city. Begu was joined by 300 Albanians from the city and another 300 from Shkodër, led by Shaban-Beg Bushatliu to defended the city. When the Montenegrins attacked Bar in 1878, Selim Begu surrendered to Prince Nikola to whom he said ”You are a fortunate lord to the city”.

He ascended the throne of Tonk following the deposition of his father by the British, who was charged guilty of mass murder. He attended all the three Delhi Durbars. In 1901, he passed a law for the conservation of wildlife and the environment in his state. This was also the first law enacted in present day Rajasthan for such a purpose. ==Early life== Ibrahim Ali Khan was born on 8 November 1849 at Tonk State, British India. His father Muhammad Ali Khan was the third Nawab of Tonk. His mother was a daughter of Ahmad Ali Khan. In 1864, Ibrahim Ali Khan started a practise of sacrificing camels on Eid al-Adha. The family discontinued the practise in 2014, after Rajasthan declared the camel as a state animal. ==Reign== Ibrahim Ali Khan's father Muhammad Ali Khan was found guilty in the mass-killings of the Thakur of Lawa state and his relatives. As a result, he was deposed by the British and exiled to Varanasi with an yearly pension of . Subsequently, Ibrahim Ali Khan ascended the throne of Tonk on 20 December 1867 at the age of 20. As a punishment, his gun salute was reduced to 17 from 21. As the Tonk State was in debts to the British at the time of Ibrahim Ali Khan's coronation, a regency council under the leadership of his grand-uncle Ubaidullah Khan was appointed. The council was removed in 1870 and Ibrahim Ali Khan was investitured to rule the state. At the 1877 Delhi Durbar, he was given a salute of 17 guns in the presence of Edward VII, the Prince of Wales.

Founded in 2007, the company is based in Hong Kong. PureVPN allows users to select from four categories: Stream, Internet Freedom, Security/Privacy, and File Sharing. The user's selection then determines which servers through which their traffic will be routed. PureVPN's 2000 servers are located in 140 countries with 87 of those countries having virtual servers that make the servers seem to be in a different country than where they are actually at. PureVPN requires users to provide their real names to use the service. It stores the day and the Internet service provider through which a user accesses the service but does not store the name of the website or actual time of access. The service has been criticized for having inconsistent speeds, being unable to access Netflix videos, and having usability problems. It has been praised for its feature set and for being based in Hong Kong which has \\"favorable data laws\\". ==History== PureVPN is owned by GZ Systems Limited, a software company that creates Android sports apps. Its mailing address is in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. PureVPN was co-founded by Uzair Gadit who is based in Pakistan. Founded in 2007, it employs contractors in the United States, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Pakistan, and Hong Kong. ==Service== PureVPN's homepage allows users to select from four categories: Stream, Internet Freedom, Security/Privacy, and File Sharing. Each category has a different configuration. Internet Freedom, for example, lets customers select which countries their Internet traffic is going through when trying to bypass the Great Firewall of China. According to Mashable's Charles Poladian, \\"many credible reports\\" indicated that PureVPN was unsuccessful in overcoming China's Great Firewall. PureVPN allows customers to select what they plan to do such as browsing social media, conducting Voice over IP calls, and streaming videos. It then uses this selection to choose specific servers for customers to send their Internet traffic through. Other configuration options include the transport protocol (the less safe UDP or the more safe but less speedy TCP) and split tunneling (choosing the apps that will direct traffic through the VPN). PureVPN offers users the option to turn on the \\"VPN Hotspot\\", allowing other devices to use the PureVPN hotspot connection. PureVPN provides desktop clients for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows and mobile clients for Android and iOS. PureVPN can be run at the same time on five sessions. It allocated 200 servers for peer-to-peer file sharing and BitTorrent usage but does not provide any servers for accessing the Tor network. PureVPN has more than 2,000 servers in over 140 countries. Their servers are in 180 separate locations and in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central America, Europe, North America, and South America. Max Eddy of PC Magazine said PureVPN \\"offers some of the best geographic diversity I have yet seen among VPN companies\\" though \\"not everything is necessarily as it seems\\". Eddy found that in 87 of those countries, PureVPN's servers are virtual servers that merely make the servers seem to be in a different country than where it really is at. PureVPN places virtual servers close to the country they say it is at, which Eddy found problematic for users who want to avoid their data passing through certain countries. ==Privacy== PureVPN stores logs containing information about what Internet service provider a customer used to access it service and which day the service was used. PureVPN does not store the exact time a customer accessed VPN. To prevent misuse and monitor quality, it records how much bandwidth customers are using. PureVPN also stores HTTP cookies for online advertising purposes as well as user account information like email address and credit card data. It does not store what websites a customer is accessing. Brian Nadel of Tom's Guide criticized PureVPN for requiring real names for user signups, even when users employ Bitcoin or gift cards for payment. VPNs largely do not require real names. Mashable's Charles Poladian praised PureVPN for being based in Hong Kong, which he says has \\"favorable data laws\\" and \\"isn't part of the intelligence-gathering alliance\\". PC Magazine's Max Eddy said that Hong Kong, as a special administrative regions of China, does not need to follow China's laws but that with China attempting to block VPNs that do not follow its rules, \\"PureVPN's legal situation is more complicated than that of the average VPN service\\". In 2017, PureVPN provided information to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents that helped result in the arrest of a Massachusetts man for cyberstalking. The company concluded that the man had accessed PureVPN through two IP addresses: one from home and one from work. Max Eddy of PC Magazine noted that the company's privacy policy says it will cooperate with investigators who give them a proper warrant and concluded, \\"In the case of PureVPN, it doesn't appear that the company breached the trust of its users\\". TechRadars Mike Williams disagreed, writing that PureVPN \\"made a big deal of its 'zero log' policy\\" on its website but did keep logs that enabled investigators to link the man to what he did on the service. ==Reception== Mashable's Charles Poladian wrote, \\"PureVPN works, sometimes even with Netflix, but it has enough issues to keep the VPN from being your go-to choice for private internet access.\\" He criticized PureVPN's erratic speeds, Internet access problems, and inability to overcome Netflix's block of VPNs so that he could watch videos available only in another country. Brian Nadel of Tom's Guide gave VPN a negative review, writing, \\"its performance was pretty bad in our testing, and we have concerns about the customer service, the real-name policy and the fact that it's essentially based in China\\". TechRadar's Mike Williams wrote, \\"PureVPN is loaded with nifty features and we saw decent results on the performance front. It's good value as well, but usability issues with the apps might put you off.\\" PC Magazine's Max Eddy wrote, \\"PureVPN is not a bad service by any measure, but it's not the best.\\" He preferred competitor VPNs Private Internet Access, which \\"offers a spartan experience at an unbeatable price\\", and NordVPN, which \\"costs slightly more than average but packs excellent features into an excellent interface\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. ==History== Albion was first platted in 1836, and by the following year there were two mills operating along the river and a tiny settlement. In 1844, a railroad line was constructed through the north side of Albion, and later commercial development gravitated to that section of the village. The railroad access brought new settlers who farmed the surrounding area, and mills and elevators became an important part of Albion's economy. Fourdries and other manufacturing interests were also established in the mid-1800s. Through the rest of the century, Albion grew steadily, and the commercial district kept pace. The earliest extant buildings in the district are Italianate commercial structures dating from the 1850s. Similar style commercial buildings were constructed into the 1880s, and make up a substantial portion of the district. Around the commercial heart of Albion, other buildings were constructed for government and social use: churches, an opera house, library, city hall and social clubs. As additional structures were built into the twentieth century, the commercial architecture began to change into a more simplified post-Victorian style. ==Description== The Superior Street Commercial Historic District contains 92 structures, of which 75 contribute to the historic character of the district. The buildings are primarily located on Superior Street, but the district does include some blocks to either side. The Superior streetscape is visually unified by the relatively uniform building heights and the similar decorative window hood moldings on the buildings. Buildings within the district range roughly from the mid 1850s to the 1950s, and are primarily of two- and three-story brick commercial buildings.

They consist of a central ruthenium(II) atom complexed to an arene group, chlorides, and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) forming an organoruthenium half-sandwich compound. Other related ruthenium anti-cancer drugs include NAMI-A and KP1019. == Structure and properties == It is envisaged that RAPTA derivatives have the “piano stool” structure like others organometallic half-sandwich compound; however, their crystal structures have not been determined. The PTA ligand was designed to make the complexes more soluble in water, and the two labile chlorido ligands can exchange to aquo ligand in the presence of water. == Synthesis == In a typical synthesis, [Ru (η6-p-cymene)Cl2] is reacted with 2 equivalents of PTA for 24 hours under reflux in methanol to yield to [Ru(η6-p-cymene)Cl2(pta)]. == RAPTA derivatives == RAPTA-T RAPTA-C Several derivatives of RAPTA were synthesized, and two of the most notable are [Ru(η6-p-cymene)Cl2(pta)] (RATPA-C) and [Ru(η6-toluene)Cl2(pta)] (RAPTA-T). == Mode of action == At first, RAPTA was anticipated to hydrolyze and interact with DNA to target primary tumors, which is similar to the platinum analogue cisplatin. Studies showed that adducts form between RAPTA compounds and proteins (especially cathepsin B and thioredoxin reductase(TrxR)). Moreover, the reactivity of RAPTA in the presence of protein was totally different than that of cisplatin. In vitro studies showed that cytotoxicity of RAPTA derivatives was much less as compared to cisplatin, and some RAPTA compounds are not even cytotoxic to healthy cells. Surprisingly, both RAPTA-C and RAPTA-T showed the ability to inhibit lung metastasis in mice bearing middle cerebral artery mammary carcinoma (by measuring the number and weight of the metastases), whilst having small effect on primary tumor. The only ruthenium complex which proves the ability against metastasis was NAMI-A, and this work has high practical application in chemotherapy since the removal of primary tumor can be done through frequent surgery while the number of metastasis treatments are limited. ==References== Category:Ruthenium complexes Category:Half sandwich compounds Category:Experimental cancer drugs ","title":"RAPTA"},{"id":"60419368","text":"Angel Sotirov (born 16 October 1943) is a Bulgarian wrestler.

The main challenge in IUV is that the rankings do not contain sufficient information to calculate the utilities. For example, if Alice ranks option 1 above option 2, we do not know whether Alice's utility from option 1 is much higher than from option 2, or only slightly higher. So if Bob ranks option 2 above option 1, we cannot know which of the two options maximizes the sum of utilities. Since a voting-rule that can only access the rankings cannot find the max-sum alternative in all cases, IUV aims to find a voting-rule that approximates the max-sum alternative. The quality of an approximation can be measured in several ways. # The distortion of a voting-rule is the worst-case (over utility functions consistent with the reported profile of rankings) ratio between the maximum utility-sum and the utility-sum of the alternative selected by the rule. # The regret of a voting- rule is the worst-case (over utility functions consistent with the reported profile of rankings) difference between the maximum utility-sum and the utility-sum of the alternative selected by the rule. Some achievements in the theory of IUV are: * Analyzing the distortion of various existing voting rules; * Designing voting rules that minimize the distortion in single-winner elections and in multi-winner elections; * Analyzing the distortion of various input formats for Preference elicitation in participatory budgeting. == Implementation == Implicit utilitarian voting rules are used in the RoboVote website. == References == Category:Social choice theory Category:Preferential electoral systems Category:Cardinal electoral systems ","title":"Implicit utilitarian voting"},{"id":"60419392","text":"Mukhtiar Singh (born 20 August 1943) is an Indian wrestler.

The story follows two timelines that slowly intertwine. The first timeline describes the life and adventures of a young girl named Kya as she grows up isolated in the marsh of North Carolina from 1952–1969. The second timeline follows a murder investigation of Chase Andrews, a local celebrity of Barkley Cove, a fictional coastal town of North Carolina.

It was also No. 1 for 2019 on Amazon.com’s list of Most Sold Books in fiction. \\"Sneaky Fuckers\\" she reads about in an ethology article. == Plot == ===Part I – The Marsh=== In 1952, six-year-old Catherine Danielle Clark (nicknamed \\"Kya\\") watches her mother abandon her and her family. While Kya waits in vain for her mother's return, she witnesses her older siblings, Missy, Murph, Mandy, and eventually Jodie, all leave as well, due to their father's drinking and physical abuse. After she is left alone with her father, he temporarily stops drinking and teaches her to fish and gives her his knapsack to hold her collections of shells and feathers. Unable to read or write, Kya relies on painting with her mother's old watercolors the birds or shores where she found the items. One day Kya finds a letter in the mailbox. She recognizes it as having been sent from her mother, and she leaves it on the table for her father to find. When he reads the letter, he becomes infuriated and burns the letter as well as most of her mother's wardrobe and canvases. He returns to drinking and takes long, frequent trips away to gamble. Eventually, he does not return at all, and Kya assumes he is dead, making him the last of the family to leave her alone in the marsh. Without money and family, she learns self-reliance, including gardening and trading fresh mussels and smoked-fish for money and gas from Jumpin', a black man who owns a gasoline station for boats. Jumpin' and his wife Mabel become lifelong good friends to Kya, and Mabel is enlisted to collect donated clothing to fit her. As Kya grows up, she faces prejudice from the townspeople of Barkley Cove, NC, who nickname her \\"The Marsh Girl\\". She is laughed at by the schoolchildren the only day she goes to school and is called \\"nasty\\" and \\"filthy\\" by the pastor's wife. However, she becomes friendly with Tate Walker, an old friend of Jodie's who sometimes fishes in the marsh. When Kya gets lost one day, Tate leads her home in his boat. Years later, he leaves her feathers from rare birds, then teaches her how to read and write. The two form a romantic, yet platonic, relationship until Tate leaves for college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He realizes Kya cannot live in his more civilized world because of how wild and independent she is, and leaves her without saying goodbye. ===Part II – The Swamp=== It's 1965 and Kya is 19. Chase Andrews, Barkley Cove's star quarterback and playboy, invites her to a picnic, during which he tries to have sex with her. He later apologizes, but the two form a romantic relationship. He shows her an abandoned fire tower, and she gives him a necklace of a shell he found during their picnic, strung on rawhide. Despite her suspicions, she believes Chase's promises of marriage and consummates their relationship in a cheap motel room in Asheville, NC. After shopping for groceries one day, she reads in the newspaper of Chase's engagement to another woman, and realizes his promises of marriage were a ruse for sex. She ends their relationship. Sometime later he finds her on a beach and attempts to rape her. Tate, having graduated from college, visits Kya and is impressed by her expanded collection of seashells. He urges her to publish a reference book on seashells, and she does so in 1968 at age 22 under her full name. The book on shells is followed by one on seabirds. With the royalties that have been coming in, Kya hires a \\"fix-it man\\", who installs running water, a water heater, tub, sink, flush toilet and kitchen cabinets. She orders furniture and bedding from Sears Roebuck. The same year, Jodie, now in the Army, also returns in Kya's life, expressing regret he left her alone and breaking the news their mother had suffered from mental illness and of her death from leukemia two years prior. Kya forgives her mother for leaving, but still cannot understand why she never returned. Kya is offered a chance to meet her publisher in Greenville, North Carolina. While she is away, Chase is found dead beneath the fire tower on the morning of October 30, 1969. The sheriff, Ed Jackson, believes it to be a murder on the basis of there being no tracks or fingerprints, including Chase's, around the tower. Ed speaks with a couple of sources and receives conflicting statements. He learns the shell necklace Kya gave to Chase was missing when his body was found, even though he wore it the night before. Kya was seen leaving Barkley Cove before the murder, then returning the day after, and was also observed speeding her boat toward the tower the night Chase died. There also were red wool fibers on Chase's jacket that belonged to a hat of Kya's. Convinced she is the culprit responsible for Chase's murder, Ed traps Kya near Jumpin's wharf and jails her without bail for two months. At Kya's trial in 1970, contradictory testimony is given. Kya's lawyer, Tom Milton, debunks the prosecutor's arguments on the basis there was no concrete evidence to convict Kya. The jury finds her not guilty. Kya returns home and reconciles with Tate. They live together until Kya, at age 64, dies peacefully in her boat. Tate finds a hidden box of her old things and realizes Kya wrote poems as Amanda Hamilton, the poet frequently quoted throughout the book. Tate also finds, underneath the poems, the shell necklace Chase wore until he died. == Ethology == Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is a topic that is covered in the book. Kya reads about ethology, including an article entitled \\"Sneaky Fuckers\\", and uses her knowledge to navigate the tricks and dating rituals of the local boys. Kya compares herself to a female firefly, who uses her coded flashing light signal to lure a male of another species to his death, or to a female mantis who lures a male mate and starts eating the mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her. \\"Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.\\" ==Cultural references== When the book peaked as a best seller early in 2019, it attracted wide attention. Since 'crawdad', used in the title, is a regional term, it sparked a rise in online queries about the word's meaning. == Film rights == Fox 2000 owns the film rights to this book. Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company will produce it with Witherspoon as the producer.

Dyschoriste oblongifolia is also called oblongleaf snakeherb or twinflower. ==Description== Dyschoriste oblongifolia is a herbaceous, rhizomatous, perennial plant growing 10–50 cm (4–20 in) tall. Stems and foliage are mostly hairless. Leaves are arranged opposite, with an entire or undulate margin, an obtuse or acute tip, a cuneate or attenuate base, and a hairy surface. D. oblongifolia produces flowers that are subsessile and either solitary or clusters on the stem with bracts that appear similar to the leaves. The flowers often appear in pairs, hence the \\"Twinflower\\" name. Flowers are lavender in color, with five lobes, four stamens, and a style 1.5 cm long. It grows in dry, sandy pine forests and flowers from June to August. ==Distribution== Dyschoriste oblongifolia grows natively in the United States in the coastal plains regions from Virginia to Florida, but is able to grow throughout the southeastern US and along the western coast. Twinflower typically has groups of two flowers. ==Habitat, ecology, and usage== Dyschoriste oblongifolia is a tolerant plant that can grow in acidic or slightly alkaline soil of sand, loam, or clay. It has high drought tolerance and low salt tolerance. Wildfire is a key part of the plant's life cycle. Populations will disappear over time if fire does not occur. Gardeners sometimes plant Dyschoriste oblongifolia in their butterfly gardens as a larval host plant for the common buckeye butterfly, and the plant is a recommended ornamental groundcover due to its high drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. ==References== Category:Acanthaceae ","title":"Dyschoriste oblongifolia"},{"id":"60419581","text":"Steve Combs (born July 22, 1941) is an American wrestler.

O'Connor wrote that \\"Blackpool exports healthy skilled people and imports the unskilled, the unemployed and the unwell.

The relationship between economics and health is blurry, complex and politically fraught. But it is too important to ignore.\\" In a column for The Irish Times, writer John McManus questioned whether Ireland had developed Shit Life Syndrome in the wake of a recent fall in life expectancy.

Power of Hope is a 64-page DC Treasury prestige format graphic novel published by DC Comics in November 2000. Written by Paul Dini with painted art by Alex Ross, Shazam!: Power of Hope is a tale of a superhero using his powers in the most human of ways: to instil hope in the hearts of children. When Billy Batson, Captain Marvel's adolescent alter ego, receives a letter from a terminally ill boy in the Children's Hospital of the city, he decides to spend a few days in the ward. A kid at heart, Captain Marvel tries to add some joy to the children's lives by taking them on flying escapades, and filling them with awe stories of his own. ==Plot== In the introductory comic, Billy Batson is shown being thrown out of his uncle's house. Despite his hardship, he is still hopeful. Seeing this, the wizard summons him to the Rock of Eternity, there transforming him into Captain Marvel. After a long day at the radio station, Billy Batson's plans to go to a baseball game go by the wayside when he is asked to go through a mailbag filled with letters to Captain Marvel. Batson returns to his apartment where he lives alone, mentioning that he once transformed into Captain Marvel to sign the lease. Batson finds a letter asking Captain Marvel to visit a hospital for sick children. As Captain Marvel, he meets with the Wizard Shazam who tells him about a child in despair in desperate need of the hope which only Captain Marvel could provide. When he arrives at the hospital, the children are happy to see their hero, except for one child in a wheelchair who Marvel believes needs his help. In the meantime, Captain Marvel tends to the other children at the hospital and strives to make each of their dreams come true. He treats some of them to a trip to the zoo, a dive into the ocean, and he even brings back a doctor from Japan to perform a challenging eye surgery on a little girl. On one of his trips, things go awry when a nearby dam explodes due to illegal workers at a nearby government mine. Luckily, he saves the children just in time before the breached water brings them to a waterfall. Later at the hospital, Captain Marvel asks the lead doctor, Dr. Ellen Miler, about the boy in the wheelchair he met earlier. Marvel discovers that his father brought him to the hospital, explaining that his son fell down the basement stairs, and learns that the boy's name is Bobby. Noticing the bruises on his arm and his broken leg, Marvel soon deducts that Bobby had been severely beaten by his father. Captain Marvel decides to talk to the boy as Billy, hoping he'll open up to someone his age. Billy shares that he, too, has experienced a difficult childhood, and Bobby asks Billy if his father also hurt him. Later, Billy meets the child's father, and then threatens him as Captain Marvel, telling him not to hurt his son anymore. After his visit is over, Captain Marvel learns from the Wizard that it was Billy, himself, whose hope was waning, and that this visit served as a reminder for how he could inject good into the world. Happy as ever, Billy decides to visit Bobby to play a game of catch. ==Fake Cancellation== As part of an April Fool's Day gag, Wizard Magazine Issue 104 featured a mock cover and synopsis for a Wonder Twins themed book, titled Wonder Twins: Form of Water. The fake article stated that Alex Ross would not produce the Captain Marvel book, and instead the Wonder Twins book would be produced because the artist was a huge fan of Super Friends TV Show. The fake storyline involved the teen heroes using their powers to stop a drought and save their monkey sidekick Gleek. Later, in Wizard Magazine Issue 111, a first page full article showed the actual Shazam book. ==Reception== The work was critically lauded by Comic Bulletin for the realistic depiction of Captain Marvel as well as Ross' photorealistic art. Both Newsarama and Syfy positively reviewed the book. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 graphic novels Category:2000 comics debuts Category:Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Category:Comics by Paul Dini Category:DC Comics graphic novels ","title":"Shazam!

The MPT is the transition between the periodicities shown in green. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), also known as the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (MPR)Mark A. Maslin and Andy J. Ridgwell (2005): Mid-Pleistocene revolution and the ‘eccentricity myth’, Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 247, 19-34, 1 January 2005, is a fundamental change in the behaviour of glacial cycles during the Quaternary glaciations. The transition happened approximately 1.25–0.7 million years ago, in the Pleistocene epoch. Before the MPT, the glacial cycles were dominated by a 41,000 year periodicity with low-amplitude, thin ice sheets and a linear relationship to the Milankovitch forcing from axial tilt. After the MPT there have been strongly asymmetric cycles with long-duration cooling of the climate and build-up of thick ice sheets, followed by a fast change from extreme glacial conditions to a warm interglacial. The cycle lengths have varied, with an average length of approximately 100,000 years. The Mid- Pleistocene Transition was long a problem to explain, as described in the article 100,000-year problem. The MPT can now be reproduced by numerical models that assume a decreasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a high sensitivity to this decrease, and gradual removal of regoliths from northern hemisphere areas subject to glacial processes during the Quaternary. The reduction in may be related to changes in volcanic outgassing, burial of ocean sediments, carbonate weathering or iron fertilization of oceans from glacially induced dust.Chalk et al. (2017): Causes of ice age intensification across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, PNAS December 12, 2017 114 (50) 13114-13119 Regoliths are believed to affect glaciation because ice with its base on regolith at the pressure melting point will slide with relative ease, which limits the thickness of the ice sheet. Before the Quaternary, northern North America and northern Eurasia are believed to have been covered by thick layers of regoliths, which have been worn away over large areas by subsequent glaciations. Later glaciations were increasingly based on core areas, with thick ice sheets strongly coupled to bare bedrock.

The inputs to a PB algorithm are: a list of possible projects that require funding, the total available budget for funding the projects, and the preferences of voters over the project. The output of a PB algorithm is a partition of budget among the projects - determining how much money to allocate to each project. A PB algorithm can treat the projects as either divisible or indivisible: * A divisible PB algorithm may allocate any amount of money to any project, as long as the sum of allocations equals the budget. It is suited for projects in which each additional dollar can be used effectively, such as charity donations. * An indivisible PB algorithm takes, as additional inputs, the costs of the projects. It returns a subset of the projects, such that the total cost of the selected projects does not exceed the budget. Each selected project is allocated its entire cost, while each unselected project is allocated nothing. It is better suited for projects which must be entirely funded in order to operate, such as constructing new buildings. == Input formats == An important consideration in designing a PB algorithm is what input format to use for preference elicitation - how each voter should express his/her preferences over the projects. Several input formats used in practice are: * Approval voting: each voter specifies a subset of the projects that they \\"approve\\" (consider as valuable), while the others are considered unapproved. This is like a binary scoring system in which each voter can score each project as either 1 or 0. * k-approval voting: each voter specifies a subset of their top k projects - the k projects that they consider to be the most valuable. * Threshold approval voting: given a threshold-value t, each voter specifies the subset of all projects which they value as at least t. * Ranked voting: each voter specifies an entire preference-relation over the projects, specifying the project that they consider the most valuable, the 2nd-most valuable, etc. These input formats are problematic for indivisible PB, since they ignore the different costs of the projects. Some newer input formats, which do consider the costs, are: * Knapsack voting: each voter specifies a subset of the projects, such that the total cost of the projects in the subset is at most the budget (regardless of how many projects are in the subset). Thus, each voter has to solve an individual knapsack problem - finding the subset which maximizes their personal utility under the budget constraint. An advantage of knapsack voting is that, if the algorithm scores each project by the number of votes it received, and chooses projects greedily in descending order of score until the budget is filled, then knapsack voting is a partially truthful mechanism. * Value-for-money ranking: each voter ranks the projects, not according to their total value, but according to their value/cost ratio. The various input formats can be compared based in terms of implicit utilitarian voting - how much each input-format is useful in maximizing the sum of utilities. From this perspective, threshold approval voting is superior to knapsack voting, ranking-by-value and ranking- by-value-for-money: it minimizes the distortion from the maximum sum-of- utilities both theoretically and empirically. After the system receives the citizens' inputs, it should compute a budget. There are various criteria by which a budget can be evaluated. == Knapsack budgeting == The budgeting method most common in practice is a greedy solution to a variant of the knapsack problem: the projects are ordered by decreasing order of the number of votes they received, and selected one-by-one until the budget is full. Alternatively, if the number of projects is sufficiently small, the knapsack problem may be solved exactly, by selecting a subset of projects that maximizes the total happiness of the citizens. The disadvantage of this method, often called individually-best knapsack budgeting, is that it may be unfair towards minorities: if 51% of the population support 10 projects and 49% support 10 other projects, and the money suffices only for 10 projects, then knapsack budgeting will choose the 10 projects supported by the 51%, and ignore the 49% altogether. Two alternatives to individually-best knapsack are: * Diverse knapsack - maximizing the number of citizens who have at least one preferred item in the budget (similarly to the Chamberlin-Courant rule for multiwinner voting). * Nash-optimal knapsack - maximizing the product of the citizens' utilities. Unfortunately, for general utility domains, both these rules are NP-hard to compute. However, diverse-knapsack is polynomially- solvable in specific preference domains, or when the number of voters is small. == Majority budgeting == One such criterion is the Condorcet criterion: the selected budget should be at least as good as any other proposed budget, according to a majority of the voters (no proposed change to it has majority support among the votes). There exists a polynomial-time algorithm for finding such a budget. The algorithm uses Schwartz sets. == Proportional budgeting == Another set of criteria is related to proportional representation. These criteria generalize the justified representation criteria from multi-winner voting. The idea of these criteria is that, if there is a sufficiently large group of voters who all agree on a specific project, then this project should receive a sufficiently large part of the budget. The expressions below formalize this intuition for the case of indivisible PB and approval voting, i.e.: * There are m discrete projects; each project j requires a cost cj. * There are n voters; each voter has a set of projects they consider desirable. *The goal is to decide on a subset of projects to fund, with a total cost of at most L. Below, L denotes the budget limit. * Strong Budget-Justified- Representation (BJR) means that, for every voter-group of size at least n/L, if all of them support at least one project, then at least one project wanted by all of them is funded. * Strong Budget-Proportional-Justified- Representation (BPJR) means that, for every integer k and every voter-group of size at least kn/L, if the projects supported by all of them cost at least k, then the projects supported by all of them should be get a funding of at least k. Unfortunately, Strong BJR budgets may not exist (and obviously the same is true for strong BPJR, since BJR is a special case of BPJR for k=1). For example, suppose there are two projects with cost 2, the budget-limit is 3, and there are two voters each of whom desires a single project. Then, each voter is a group of size 1 > 2/3, so BJR requires that the project of each voter is funded, but the sum of costs of both projects is 4>3. Therefore, weaker variants of these criteria have been suggested: *Weak BJR means that, for every voter-group of size at least n/L, if all of them support at least one project of cost one (the minimal cost), then at least one project wanted by all of them is funded. *Weak BPJR means that, for every integer k and every voter-group of size at least kn/L, if the projects supported by all of them cost at least k, then the fundings for projects supported by all of them should be at least the maximum cost of a project-subset with cost at most k supported by all of them. Fortunately, Weak BPJR budgets (and hence weak BJR budgets) always exist and can be found by a super-polynomial algorithm. Finding a weak-BPJR budget is NP-hard, but finding a weak-BJR budget can be done by a polynomial greedy algorithm. Another criterion, Weak Local BPJR, is weaker than weak BPJR but stronger than weak BJR; it can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm based on Phragmen's sequential rule. Each of these criteria has a weaker variant where, instead of the external budget-limit L, the denominator is W, which is the actual amount used for funding. Since usually W == Core budgeting == For the case of divisible PB and utility voting, a compelling budgeting method is one based on the core of the underlying game. A budget is considered \\"in the core\\" if no subset of k voters can take their share of the budget (k L / n) and fund a subset of the projects such that the utility of each voter in the subset strictly increases. There are efficient algorithms for calculating the core budget for some natural classes of utility functions. == Donor coordination == The donor coordination problem is a variant of divisible PB in which the budget is donated by the voters themselves (rather than fixed in advance). A coordination algorithm can improve the efficiency of the distribution of funds. For example, suppose three projects are considered: theater, chess club, and basketball field. There are two donors: Alice and Bob, each of whom wants to contribute 3000. Alice prefers indoor activities (theater or chess), while Bob prefers competitive activities (chess or basketball). * If they do not coordinate, then naturally Alice contributes 1500 to each indoor activity, while Bob contributes 1500 to each competitive activity. The resulting distribution is 1500, 3000, 1500. Each donor feels a happiness of 4500 from the donations to his/her preferred projects. * In contrast, if they coordinate, they can contribute everything to the chess club, so the distribution becomes 0, 6000, 0. Now, each donor feels a happiness of 6000, so this distribution Pareto- dominates the previous one. Since the donations are voluntary, it is important that the coordination algorithm ensures that each voter weakly gains from participating in the algorithm, i.e., the amount contributed to projects he approves of is weakly higher when he participates than when he does not. This requirement may be incompatible with efficient budget allocation when the voters' utilities are general linear functions. However, it is attainable when the voters' utilities are linear and binary, i.e., in the approval voting model: * There are m charities; each charity can benefit from any amount of money put into it. * There are n donors; each donor has a set of charities he/she cares about. Each donor i is willing to donate a total amount of Ci. * The goal is to decide on a distribution of the total funds collected from all donors (the sum of the Ci) among the m charities. The utility of each agent from a given distribution is the sum of money allocated to his/her beloved charities. Several rules have been analyzed in this setting. They are exemplified below for a setting with 4 charities (a,b,c,d) and 5 donors who contribute 1 each, and whose beloved sets are ac, ad, bc, bd, a. * The uncoordinated rule just divides the contribution of each agent i among the charities liked by i. So the funding distribution is 2,1,1,1 and the utilities of the five agents are 3,3,2,2,2. This mechanism is implementable and individually-rational, but not efficient: the outcome is dominated, for example, by the distribution 3,2,0,0, where the utilities are 3,3,2,2,3. * The Nash-optimal rule finds a budget-allocation maximizing the product of utilities. It is Pareto optimal, implementable and individually-rational. However, it is not Strategyproof nor resource-monotonic. * The Constrained- utilitarian rule finds a budget-allocation maximizing the sum of utilities from the set of all implementable rules. It is implementable, individually- rational, strategyproof and resource-monotonic. However, it is not Pareto- optimal. * There is no PB rule that satisfies all five properties, even with binary preferences. == References == Category:Electoral systems Category:Computational social science Category:Participatory budgeting ","title":"Participatory budgeting algorithm"},{"id":"60419874","text":"Akhni () is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Sylhet region.

Willoughby played in Manly's 1975 preliminary final loss against Eastern Suburbs scoring a try in a 28–13 defeat. In 1976, Manly claimed the minor premiership and reached the grand final against the Parramatta Eels who were playing in their first ever grand final. Willoughby was selected to play from the bench. In the grand final itself, Parramatta went into half time level with Manly at 7–7. In the second half and with 10 minutes remaining, Parramatta made a play to the right hand side of the field and the ball eventually reached Neville Glover. With the try line wide open, Glover dropped the ball over the line which would have given Parramatta the match winning try. In the final five minutes Manly held on after a Parramatta onslaught to win the premiership 13–10.

He was married to Marija Borci. Doda derived from the family today part of Tushi and Shani. In 1734, he writes that Kurt Mahmut Pasha, bey of Shkodër, traveled to his home city Gjakova. According to the Albanian newspaper Leka from 1933, in July 1733, Doda warned that the Pasha of Shkodër was planning on launching an attack on Montenegro. He sent the news to Zorzi Grimani, the General of Dalmatia. In 1735, Anton Doda thanked secretary Cromwell for the position of vice consul of Venice. In 1736, Doda writes that Shkodër has 1000 shops in the market. At the beginning of the 17th century, Doda built his house in Tophane close to the Venetian embassy in Shkodërr. In 1747 Doda practiced the system of leasing contracts for ships travelling to Venice from Ulcinj due to the fear of pirates. In 1755, Doda writes to the Venetians of Moro that an army was grazing in Catarro (Kotor) forcing Catholic Albanians to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. He also writes about the pirates from Ulcinj in Tripoli where he states that ”no one even dares visiting the barber”. According to Doda, ”the war between the Begolli family of Peja and the Pashaliks of Gjakova had disrupted the economy of Shkodër”. Doda was fluent in Albanian, Italian, Latin, Slavic and Ottoman. According to Doda, in 1758, March 18, the border of Albania ended in Nis. He died on November 24, 1766. In 1771, Duoda was criticized in a German publication by Johann Friedrich Le Breto (1732-1807) who accused Duoda for serving the consul Cumano in Durrës and for having given himself the title of consul.

It is named tall sea pen because it looks like a quill sticking in the bottom of the sea. It forms habitat for several key crustacean species. == Morphology == F. quadrangularis’s appearance is often described as feather-like. More specifically, they look like a quill sticking in the seabed. They are anchored by a peduncle as its base and they have a calcareous axial rod growing upward with polyps arising from it. Each polyps has eight tentacles. They can grow up to 2 meters with up to a quarter of the axis embedded in the sediment. == Distribution == The tall sea pen can be found globally. They are most commonly found in sea lochs and open waters of the northwest coast of Scotland, mainly found with a depth below 20m to 2000m. They have a patchy distribution around the UK, on the northwest coast of Scotland and Ireland. They are also distributed in coastal waters of the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, New Zealand, Japan and the Gulf of Mexico. However, the abundance of this specie is low due to the high trawling intensity. == Reproduction == The tall sea pan is dioecious, which means that they have the male and females reproductive organs in separate individuals. The females will develop one oocyte each time throughout the year. With a sex ratio of 1:1 of males to females in a population, spawning occurs in the midwinter. They have a large pool of offspring with a survival rate of about 10%. It is still unclear why they have this distinct patter of oogenesis and winter spawning. Some are guessing that it is due to the influence of environmental cues and this tall sea pen’s deep-sea habitat. Since the distribution and sensitivity to bottom fishing activities is very limited, tall sea pen reduce in population number which may lead to genetic isolation and reduced diversity. == Ecological role == Sea pens are home to many secondary polyps that are either specialized in either feeding or water intake. They are associated with the brittle star Asteronyx lovenii, and their colonis have been observed as a nurseries for fish larve. == Threats == The greatest threat to the survival of F. quadrangularis colonies is demersal fishing activities. This specie has very limited distribution that it is restricted to the deep basins, sensitivity to bottom fishing activities, and low resilience to physical disturbance which make them vulnerable to fishing activities. Trawling often happens at places where Norway lobsters and shrimps present; F. quadrangularisis a typical of essential habitat for these species. Since F. quadrangularishas a rigid axial rod that is unable to withdraw into the sediment unlike other UK sea pen species, bottom trawling would cause F. quadrangularissignificant physical disturbance. As a result, F. quadrangularis is decreasing in population numbers which may lead them to genetic isolation and reduced diversity. However, F. quadrangularis can have resilience to human impacts if distant populations have a high connectivity since they could have a higher genetic diversity and a higher geneflow. == Conservation == F. quadrangularis is considered to be nationally rare and are a high conservation significance specie. === In the UK === The tall sea pan is a Species of Principle Importance under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, 2006, UK. It is also on the Biodiversity Action Plan list of Priority Species.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/16/contents === In Mediterranean === The tall sea pan is a sensitive and essential fish habitat since it forms habitat for several commercially important crustaceans. == References == Category:Funiculinidae ","title":"Funiculina quadrangularis"},{"id":"60420419","text":"Robert Thacker may refer to: *Robert J.

The track was a surprise release that didn't receive any marketing or promotion prior to release and coincided with the start of Deafheaven's March–April 2019 US tour with Baroness. ==Critical reception== Music critics praised the track for being one of Deafheaven's heaviest songs to date with many critics noting that it differed greatly from the other songs from the Ordinary Corrupt Human Love sessions. Other critics noted elements of thrash metal and compared it to the darker and heavier material on their 2015 album New Bermuda. In his write-up for \\"Black Brick\\"'s release, Andrew Sacher of BrooklynVegan wrote: \\"It's darker and more evil than Deafheaven almost ever sound, with mile-a-minute thrash riffs, metalcore chugs, and other devil horn-worthy sounds worked in to their usual post-black metal approach. It's the first song they released since being nominated for a Grammy (but losing to High on Fire), and if you thought Grammy exposure would make them want to go in an even softer direction, you thought wrong.\\" Revolver said of the song: \\"Not only has the single dropped seemingly out of the blue, but it's also Deafheaven's heaviest offering yet, a fully necro blast of sepulchral grimness. The seven-and-a-half-minute cut is a B-side from Ordinary Corrupt Human Love, and one can only wonder how different the album would have felt as a whole with its inclusion.\\" In their review of Deafheaven's performance on their tour with Baroness, the Los Angeles Times' August Brown wrote: \\"The new, writhing single 'Black Brick' pulls more from classic thrash, and its sudden peals of violence put everything else around it in sharper focus.

It is the only representative of its genus on the continent. == Description == Like most other Marchantiales, it has a flat, dichotomously branched thallus, which in this species is pale green, flattened, dichotomously branched, thin, and somewhat shiny, measuring 0.6 to 1.5 cm long, less than 1 cm wide. The thallus margins are brownish purple in patches and somewhat undulate, curling upward when dry. The dorsal surface has a faint pattern of irregular polygons, and around inconspicuous pores to the air chambers below. The ventral surface is dark purple, shiny towards the margins, and green medially. The ventral scales are small, dark, and purple, poorly developed at maturity. The peculiar oil bodies found in so many liverworts are found scattered throughout the thallus, ventral scales, and sporogonial receptacle. Cryptomitrium does not reproduce asexually via gemmae. It usually reaches its best development in February or March, depending on the amount and distribution of the winter rainfall. During the long rainless season the plants dry up, the tips reviving and giving rise to new plants with the advent of the autumn rains. Receptacle of Cryptomitrium tenerum spherical sporophytes visible below. == Taxonomy == The species was originally named Marchantia tenerum by Hooker, but later placed in the genus Cryptomitrium by Austin before being revised into its current description by Underwood in 1884. The genus Cryptomitrium is placed in the Aytoniaceae with other liverworts with flat thalli and stalked receptacles, such as Asterella, The genus name means “hidden turban” in reference to the inconspicuous sheath around the immature sporangium. The common name for Cryptomitrium tenerum is the flying saucer liverwort referring to the flat disc-shaped sporangiophore perched on a tall thin stalk. == Reproduction == The species is monoecious. As in certain related species, such as Asterella, the antheridia form a narrow, elongated, median, dorsal group lying immediately posterior to the female receptacle. The female receptacle is terminal. Its stalk has a single rhizoid furrow. The disk is hemispherical when young but finally becomes circular and nearly flat. It is without lobes when mature. The distinctive discoid carpocephalum is easily recognized when mature, but earlier in its development may be more or less low-pyramidal; however, it is never lobed, and rather distinctive on this account. Cryptmitrium tenerum sporangia taken through a dissecting microscope 25x Sporangia brown, nearly spherical, with very short seta, three to seven per receptacle, each opening by a lid; mauring in early spring. Spores brown, 35-450 um, more or less distinctly tetrahedral, irregularly areolate-lamellate, with a pellucid margin. The elaters are attenuate, 300-450 um contorted, often branched, and spiraled. == Distribution and habitat == Cryptomitrium tenerum occurs in Mediterranean climates with cool wet winters and dry summers and forms small to locally extensive mats on bare and usually shaded humid soil on hillsides, rock outcrops, and streambanks. Wildfires are suspected to play a role in maintaining habitat. Capsules develop in late winter to early spring, depending on elevation. It is a poor competitor with vascular plants and populations tend to disappear as succession progresses. == References == Category:Aytoniaceae Category:Flora of California Category:Bryophyta of North America ","title":"Cryptomitrium tenerum"},{"id":"60420564","text":"Richard Beamon Martin (February 23, 1913 - April 11, 2012) was a bishop in The Episcopal Church. ==Early Life and Education== Martin was born on February 23, 1913 in Peak, South Carolina, the son of Benjamin Butler Martin and Viola Glasgow.

He held teaching positions at the University of Pretoria and in Ghent, Belgium. == Life == Akkermann and his twin sister Sabine were born in Krefeld, the children of Hermann Akkermann and Sabina Becker. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Krefeld and at the Hamburger Kunstakademie from 1926 to 1929, although he planned to become an engineer. Deciding in the end to focus on the arts, he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts of Paris from 1929 to 1931, working at the studio of Jakob Mellen in Hüls during vacation times. His first major work was a war memorial for the victims of World War I, unveiled at the cemetery of Nieukerk in Kerken in 1932. Akkermann studied further at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, with Hugo Lederer and Fritz Klimsch in 1932/33. Back in Krefeld, he married Adele Bieger in 1942, and the couple had three children. Many of Akkermann's works were destroyed by bombing in World War II. In 1950, Akkermann became a professor and head of a sculpture class at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. From 1957 he worked as a professor in Ghent, Belgium. Akkermann's twin sister also became a sculptor whose works are shown in public space. He died in Krefeld in 1982. == Works == Akkermann created large sculptures for public spaces, especially Christian art and monuments for churches and cemeteries. His early war memorial for the cemetery in Kerken shows larger-than-lifesize figures of six soldiers carrying the coffin of a comrade. He designed the interior of the Autobahnkapelle Geismühle near Krefeld, including a large bronze sculpture instead of an altar.

Entirely located in Canada, it covers an area of approximately 373,735 km2 and crosses the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and the western portion of Quebec. Various islands in James Bay which belong to the Northwest Territories are also considered to be part of the ecoregion. ==Setting== The Southern Hudson Bay taiga is contained within the conceptually larger Nearctic realm and possesses a number of neighbouring ecoregions including the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga, Northern Canadian Shield taiga, Central Canadian Shield forests, and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests. Prominent geological features in the region include the Hudson Platform and an underlying layer of Paleozoic limestone bedrock. Its soils, which are primarily Gelic and Dystric Histosols and Eutric Gleysols, are characterized by shallow layers of permafrost, slightly acidic pH levels, and hydromorphic conditions. The Southern Hudson Bay taiga represents an area where a number of hydrologically significant rivers, such as the Nelson River and the Mattagami River, deposit their headwaters from farther inland into the Arctic Ocean via Hudson Bay. Alternative geographic classifications also commonly refer to the region as the Hudson Bay Lowlands. ==Climate== Classified as a subarctic climate under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, typical seasonal conditions in the Southern Hudson Bay taiga consist of brief, cool summers and cold winters. Average temperatures range from 10.5°C to 11.5°C during summer months, -19°C to -16°C during winter months, and -5°C to -2°C throughout the year. Precipitation levels vary greatly within the region due to differences in temperature, with the eastern and western areas receiving an annual average of 500-800 mm and the northern areas as little as 400 mm. ==Flora== Belonging to the circumboreal floristic region, the Southern Hudson Bay taiga contains a total of 1178 different plant species – none of which are considered endemic to the area. The major plant communities in this ecoregion, which are characteristic of the taiga biome, primarily consist of black spruce (Picea mariana) and tamarack (Larix laricina) forests. Species which commonly dominate the forest undergrowth are birch (Betula), willow (Salix), and marsh Labrador tea (Rhododendron tomentosum). Due to the tundra conditions in the northern extent of the region, a latitudinal gradient of plant biodiversity exists which increases towards the south. Wetlands in this ecoregion are estimated to occupy between 50 and 75% of the land area. ==Fauna== In terms of species composition, the animal populations of the Southern Hudson Bay taiga are largely transitional between those of the Central Canadian Shield forests and Low Arctic tundra. The region contains a total of 45 mammal species, 160 bird species, and 2 reptile species. The coastal areas of southern Hudson Bay are home to polar bears (Ursus marinus), arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), seals (Phocidae), beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus). Approaching the Central Canadian Shield forests near James Bay, the ecoregion gives way to moose (Alces), black bears (Ursus americanus), wolves (Canis lupus), and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). Other species which can be found throughout the entirety of the ecoregion are caribou (Rangifer tarandus), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and Canada goose (Branta canadensis). ==Human use== With an average population density estimated at less than 1 person/km2, the majority of the human population in the Southern Hudson Bay taiga is concentrated in a number of smaller towns and communities located along the southern coast of Hudson Bay. These include Churchill, Moosonee, and Moose Factory as well as the First Nation communities of Fort Severn, Fort Albany, and Attawapiskat. Much of the ecoregion is the traditional territory of the Cree, Dene, Inuit, and Métis peoples. The region also witnessed the development of the Hudson's Bay Company during the 17th century and played an integral role in the North American fur trade. It was part of a larger area referred to as Rupert's Land in which the Hudson's Bay Company had exclusive commercial rights until it was sold to the Canadian government in 1870. ==Conservation and threats== The World Wildlife Fund has classified the conservation status of the ecoregion as relatively stable/intact as a result of its sparse, low-impact human presence. It is therefore not part of the WWF's Global 200 list of ecoregions most in need of conservation efforts. Approximately 9.32% of all lands in the Southern Hudson Bay taiga are considered protected including Polar Bear Provincial Park, Wapusk National Park, and Jog Lake Conservation Reserve. As a result of its more northern latitude, the area is not subject to intense logging or deforestation pressures. The primary conservation concerns for the region surround the proposed hydroelectric projects near James Bay and the regulation of hunt camps. Estimates indicate that the Southern Hudson Bay taiga will experience an increase in temperature of 3.39°C and an increase in precipitation of 13.32 mm by 2050 as a result of climate change. ==References== ==External links== *WWF Report of Southern Hudson Bay Taiga Ecoregion *The Atlas of Global Conservation by the Nature Conservancy *FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World *The Atlas of Canada *Map of Traditional Indigenous Territories in North America Category:Ecoregions of Canada Category:Nearctic ecoregions Category:Taiga and boreal forests Category:Hudson Bay ","title":"Southern Hudson Bay taiga"},{"id":"60420879","text":"Satyanand Bhogta is a member of the Rashtriya Janata Dal political party.

In a letter to The Times (8 July 1965) Womersley laid out his ideas about the coexistence of man and machine: _Traffic should serve not master people. Urban motorway proposals should include careful analysis of the human unhappiness and environmental destruction that will result._ Womersley was dedicated to providing social housing that improved not only quality of living, but quality of life.

His most famous construction, Park Hill, continues to be celebrated today and at the time of its construction was considered \\"a brave, enlightened approach to housing – people coming across the world to see it.

In Architects’ Journal, 24 October 2013. Delivering a paper to the Architectural Association in 1966, Womersley was clear that architectural creativity and emotional well-being are not mutually exclusive: _If we are to have joy again we need to make creative design once more the motive force in town and country planning – making a whole-hearted attempt to produce something worthy of today when judged by those of tomorrow._ Womersley’s Local Authority office invested in building schools, churches and other public buildings that were valued locally, but it was their social housing that became of world importance. With his team, Womersley was able to pioneer new building technologies that fostered creativity that placed Sheffield in the forefront of social housing, culminating in the city hosting the RIBA annual conference in 1963. Jones, Peter Blundell (2008). University of Sheffield School of Architecture 1908–2008: A Centenary History. Sheffield: University Print Service. == Training == Womersley was born before the First World War and, in his youth, would have been aware of the hardship endured by ordinary people during the Depression Years through unemployment, poor housing and bad living conditions in the tightly packed Industrial cities of the North. His father, a Huddersfield cloth designer, was unable to see the potential in his son and was unwilling to fund his university education. Financing his own studies at Huddersfield School of Architecture, Womersley received a rounded basic training in practical design, building construction and professional practice. Duerden, P. (2005). Northampton with Vision, 22 October 2005. Retrieved 1 April 2019 at http://www.northamptonwithvision.co.uk/tour.htm He was mentored by Norman Culley, First Head of the school. Writing in is obituary, Womersley described Culley as a man who \\"had that vital spark that turns a teacher into a leader: boundless enthusiasm, perpetual youthfulness and the power to enthuse and inspire.\\" Womersley, J Lewis. (1969). Obituary of Norman Culley, June 1969. Both men shared the belief that in order to produce buildings that are worthy of heritage, the architect must strive for ‘beauty through simplicity.’ Womersley, J. L. (1963) Productivity for What? Speech to the RIBA Conference, Sheffield. Following his study of Architecture, Womersley completed a degree in Town Planning and developed a keen interest in the work of the Garden City Movement and sought to emulate for his generation the high qualities of housing layout and amenities achieved in Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. He became a powerful supporter of the movement to create a better, more egalitarian society in the re-building of war-devastated Britain. == Early career == After qualifying, Womersley spent some time working in London, where he designed an underground restaurant in Golders Green, complete with sprung dance floor. He was awarded a Nicholson Travelling Scholarship by the West Yorkshire Society of Architects in 1933, which gave him the opportunity to travel to Europe, sketching buildings in Paris, Rome, Florence and Venice and hillside towns. This was a key experience for Womersley, who was to repeat this trip some twenty years later, this time accompanied by Sheffield City councillors, in a journey that would inspire the city planning in the renewal of Sheffield. He left London to become Herbert J. Rowse’s Principal Assistant in the Liverpool practice of Bradshaw, Rowse and Harker, designing municipal buildings in St. Helens and Fylde and working in the redevelopment of parts of Liverpool and Birkenhead. Morris, Ivor. (1987). J.L. Womersley. Yorkshire Architect Centenary Year. February, 1987. He married a school teacher, Jean Roberts, who he met whilst walking in Bridge of Orchy in the Scottish Highlands. Together, they had two sons, Richard (1944–1985) and John Womersley (1941–2017). == Northampton == In 1946 Womersley was appointed Borough Architect of Northampton, subsequently being made Borough Architect and Town Planning Officer. Believing that housing should be inseparable from town planning, Womersley, JL. (1965). Architecture as a Complete Environment. Paper to the Architectural Association, 9 February 1965. Womersley’s designs included shops, schools, colleges, bus garages, markets, fire stations, libraries, public houses and places of worship. The national housing shortage, coupled with rising building costs necessitated the provision of simple, low cost housing made with good quality materials. On 8 November 1951, the block of four Hopley Houses on Winchester Road, Delapre were ceremoniously opened, providing proof that a terraced house that could accommodate a family of five could be built for £1083, Dream that Became Bricks and Mortar. Northampton Chronicle and Echo, 9 November 1951 p6. one third less than the average cost of council houses of the same type and constructed in three and a half months, rather than twelve. Inspired by Radburn Design Housing, cottage housing was linked by a footpath system separating pedestrians from roads. Driven by his belief that the motor vehicle had the potential to be a ‘wrecker of the environment’ as well as impacting upon the senses of man, Womersley wrote on the design of his Eastfield estate: _In Eastfield, footpaths branching from the pavement of the spine road give pedestrian access to the front entrances of houses along each Green and connect at the other end with the footpaths in the Park. In order to encourage children to play on this, small paved play areas were incorporated adjacent to the branch footpaths… Being as remote as possible from both service roads and the main spine road, these were really safe. Kitchens were planned to overlook the pedestrian ways so that mothers could keep their children in view._ Womersley, JL. (1954). Some Housing Experiments on Radburn Principles. The Town Planning Review, Vol. 25(3) pp. 182–194. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press. Trees were carefully preserved, houses being grouped around them. Similar attention to detail is evident at King’s Heath, Dallington Fields and his other estates. Womersley’s drawings of the layout and dwelling types were passed on to his successor, Brian Bunch, who succeeded him as Northampton Borough Architect ad Town Planning Officer in 1953. It was in Northampton that Womersley’s first ‘point block’ was built, the 10 storey St. Katherine’s Court, balancing the limitations of space with housing shortage and allowing people to walk a short distance to work, unmolested by traffic. This was Womersley’s first venture into building upwards: multi-storey living. == Sheffield: flood the valleys, plant the tops == Davies & Womersley, High Storrs School Womersley had already begun to make his mark in Sheffield, designing the now Grade II listed building, High Storrs School, Ecclesall, with WG Davies in 1933. The post-war 1952 Development Plan identified 20,000 unfit houses, with a margin for 15,000, in a plan to relieve overcrowding in heavily industrial areas of Sheffield. The plan estimated that 2,700 acres would be required to house the population, although there were only 2,400 acres available. The inhabitants of the slums were removed to council estates on Hallamshire, with the impact upon the tenants of costlier rents and longer distances for them to travel to work. Escher, L. A. (1981). A Broken Wave: The Rebuilding of England 1940–1980. London: Penguin. It became apparent, following a failed application for the city boundaries to be extended, that the pre-war density of population would need to be addressed. The main challenges were the need for slum clearance, a shortage of land on which to house the population and the immobility of heavy industry. In order to re-house most people near to their original homes with adequate space in an attractive environment, use had to be made of land that was considered too steep for development using a combination of high and low rise buildings. The Housing Development Committee of the Corporation of Sheffield. (1962). Ten Years of Housing in Sheffield. Sheffield: City of Sheffield Printing Department. In 1953 Lewis Womersley was chosen to solve this problem from 40 competitors for the post of City Architect of Sheffield. Laying out his vision, Womersley made the commitment that: _If we are to design cities and not merely housing we must go beyond the individual dwelling and portray the grand design._ He led Sheffield Council leaders on visits to sites across Europe, to share his vision of \\"an audacious programme of building around the city.\\" What he was about to achieve in one decade was the first benign urban transformation on a scale of a city of over half a million people that we had ever seen in Britain. Escher, L. A. (1981). A Broken Wave: The Rebuilding of England 1940–1980. London: Penguin. Womersley was an advocate of high rise living and it was seen as a solution to slum clearance, being raised at two major RIBA symposia in 1955 and 1957, where he suggested that 50% of the population wished to inhabit high-rise accommodation. Parkinson-Bailey, J. J. (2000). Manchester: An Architectural History. Womersley established an imaginative and highly enthusiastic team, including Ivor Smith and Jack Lynn, committed to creating the good quality accommodation for people to live in. The city’s topology, three main land masses containing steep escarpment, rolling plateau and a series of ridges, presented a challenge but allowed many of them to be visually related; \\"with the hilltop architectural compositions producing something of the fascination of the Italian hill towns\\" that had inspired Womersley in the 1930s. Quoted in his obituary in The Architectural Review, November 1990 The city centre, which, up until then had been neglected, with all council resources directed towards housing, was to be redeveloped under Womersley’s department, including the Hole in the Road and the Castle Market, designed by Andrew Derbyshire with J. Stuart Mackie. The Castle Market was intended to form the cornerstone of a pedestrianised city centre which was as pioneering as Park Hill. Unfortunately it never progressed and the market was demolished in 2015. The Greenhill site, Beauchief and Greenhill, presented an opportunity to house 10,000 people, but in order to do so, it had to be drained, with the water pumped back into the city system. Utilising the Radburn style hedgerows and footpaths, in accordance with his beliefs, to provide separation of pedestrian from traffic, the 70 person per acre density was achieved using three thirteen-storey towers for child-free domiciles; four-storey maisonettes for small families; and two- storey terraces with corner flats for larger families. Gleadless Estate, Sheffield Gleadless Valley was ear marked to house 17,000 people but, with slopes averaging 1 in 8, the landscape presented a challenge that was transformed into an advantage and today remains the most spectacular of his many estates. Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004). Pevsner Architectural Guides: Sheffield. London: Yale University Press. Writing in The Builder in 1963, Womersley noted: _One great advantage that can often be obtained is a splendid view. By arranging for dwellings to be terraced up the hillside with living rooms on the upper floors, a view can be obtained over the roofs of the houses below. Specially designed patio houses in the Rollestone neighbourhood at Gleadless and Norfolk Park will exploit its topographical position._ Womersley, J. L. (1963). New Approaches to Home Planning and Design. In The Builder, 12 July 1963. The estate has a footpath system independent of roads linking three distinct neighbourhoods, each with its own infant and junior schools and shopping centre and comprises two-storey houses, three-storey flats, four and six storey maisonettes and three tower-blocks crowning the hilltop. The Housing Development Committee of the Corporation of Sheffield. (1962). Ten Years of Housing in Sheffield. Sheffield: City of Sheffield Printing Department. Following transformation of the two of Sheffield’s central hills, Netherthorpe and Woodside, attention was turned to the third, Park Hill, which was to become the largest listed building in Europe. Commenting in Melvyn Bragg’s Reel History of Britain, Charlie Luxton interviewed by Melvyn Bragg, Reel History of Britain: Series 1 episode 17. BBC, 2011. Charlie Luxton describes it as, \\"one of Britain’s best examples of what modern council housing can be about. The idea was to create a sense of community with these streets in the sky… They invested in the infrastructure, they invested in the shops, the schools, the playgrounds\\". Park Hill’s principal architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, were appointed almost straight from college without formal interviews. Derbyshire, Andrew. Quoted in Gold, John R. (2007). The Practice of Modernism 1954–1972. London: Routledge. Inspired by Le Corbusier’s Unite d’Habitation in Marseille they created these ‘streets in the sky’ on the steeply sloping land near the city centre. Every effort was made to establish a community feel – the decks, or ‘streets’, facilitating doorstep gossip and encouraging children to play ‘outside’. The streets, it is affectionately recalled, were wide enough for milk floats and tricycles and importantly separated man and child from traffic. Like the sheltered balconies of each flat, the decks provided magnificent views. They were given the street names of the original slums, Norwich, Long Henry and Hague, with previous neighbours housed close to one another as far as possible. Contained in the grounds were shops, schools, children’s play areas, pubs, concierges and a police station. Womersley reflected on his team’s architectural developments across Sheffield that: _We have envisaged each scheme, be it new development on virgin territory or the redevelopment of a slum area, as a piece of civic design to be carefully integrated with the whole Town Plan. Most of our projects were important additions to the total environment – the more so because the topographical characteristics of the city allow many of them to relate visually to one another._ J. L. Womersley. In The Architect’s Journal. 10 July 1963 pp. 82–83. However, sound proofing was very poor, it was not envisaged that every flat would house a television and parking provision was negligible due to the focus on provision of green space in which to walk. For the major high rise developments, Hyde Park and Park Hill, from the 1970s, a lack of maintenance; the loss of most of the caretakers and of the police station led to vandalism and vermin. With Hyde Park, the ‘keep’ of the mega-structures, it is acknowledged that Womersley over-reached himself – the building was remote and it was exposed to the elements – the magnificent view unable to compensate for the wind on the landings. Escher, L. A. (1981). A Broken Wave: The Rebuilding of England 1940–1980. London: Penguin. The Labour government had gone and with it, the era of mass social housing had disappeared also. After a series of accidents, one in which a girl in Hyde Park was killed when a television set was dropped from a balcony, door after door were boarded up. Tuffrey, P. (2013). Sheffield Flats Park Hill and Hyde Park: Hope, Eye-Sore, Heritage. England: Fonthill. Hyde Park was demolished and, had it not been listed in 1998, Park Hill would have suffered the same fate. It was decided that the responsibility for town planning would be removed from the architects and placed in the control of the City Engineers and with this, the ability of Womersley’s department to bring about social change through housing was depleted. Perhaps ironically, a series of major roads were built through the city and man and machine were forced to co-exist. The ethos of the department was collapsed. Gold, J. R. (2007).The Practice of Modernism: Modern Architects and Urban Transformation 1954–1972. London: Routledge It was rare for architects to exert control over the development of roads in relation to buildings and this was a freedom that would continue to create conflict for Womersley in his later career. In 2006 the developers Urban Splash secured agreement with the council to complete a regeneration programme to provide a ‘mixed and multigenerational community’ – but one with relatively few ‘affordable’ homes. Hatherley, Owen. (2011). Sheffield’s Park Hill Regeneration is Class Cleansing. The Guardian, 28 September 2011. Park Hill continues its regeneration today under the auspices of Urban Splash and many of Womersley’s department’s developments across Sheffield and the town centre remain. == Manchester == By 1964, the input of City Architect into the development of the city, along with the route for the M1, was in the hands of the City Engineer and Womersley left Sheffield to join Hugh Wilson as partner in private practice in Manchester, taking with him six of his Sheffield staff, including Jack Lynn and J. Stuart Mackie. Oxford Road, Manchester, 1985; Precinct Centre (far left), Computer Building (left) and Mathematics Building (centre) The firm planned Manchester Education Precinct, which unified the Manchester Business School, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University and city colleges. The Manchester Education Precinct Plan covered a larger area than any campus in Europe, extending two-and-a-half miles out of the city centre and covering several square miles (280 acres). The plan was a joint enterprise of the City Council, the university and the area health authority. As well as student residences, lecture halls and advisory services the plan included restaurants, bookshops and banks.The University of Manchester. Manchester: Communications Office, University, [1975]; p. 3 The combined population of staff and students from the six or seven institutions was then about 25,000. As well as the politics involved in working with several disunited institutions, there were huge physical problems. The team, including Tony Pass, encountered great difficulty implementing the vehicle separation which had become their trademark policy. Footways had to be elevated 6m from ground level to be above the traffic, but funding was delivered piecemeal, resulting in pedestrian walkways, ramps and bridges that were incorporated into isolated buildings at great cost, connecting to nothing in particular. This also presented problems with the entrances of buildings as most of them subsequently had two access points, one at ground level and the other six metres above, which proved difficult to staff. The Precinct Centre bridge It was partly to try to unify the overall Plan that the next phase, Precinct Centre was conceived. It was sited at a ‘hinge point’ between the colleges and residences to provide a commercial heart, mainly at walkway level. The Precinct Centre incorporated a shopping centre, a business school, offices and student accommodation across six floors. This model of mixed-purpose ‘streets in the sky’ was designed to provide a lively University hub. Wilson & Womersley. (1967). Manchester Education Precinct: Final Report. Despite difficulties connecting adjacent buildings, the planning of the campus, with careful consideration to separating pedestrian from car, was well received and Wilson and Womersley’s detailed survey and analysis of human and vehicular traffic, parking requirements, and public transport, environment and buildings facilitated free movement of its population. Enough of the individual major development sites Maths and Computer Science buildings, Business School, Royal Northern College of Music were linked to make the Precinct Centre viable, but only just. It was planned that the walkways would be extended to All Saints and the City, but this was thwarted by the reluctance of the new Polytechnic, and the central theme of the Plan was abandoned. In managing slum clearance, Manchester experienced the same difficulties encountered by Sheffield City Council with shortage of land, but, unlike Sheffield, was opposed to high rise living. Parkinson-Bailey, J. J. (2000). Manchester: An Architectural History. Manchester: Manchester University Press. Despite concentrating efforts on the refurbishment of existing architecture, rather than demolition and renewal, the area of Hulme had been bulldozed by the 1960s and a vision for Hulme close to that expounded by the Park Hill estate emerged. This was the third major commission for Wilson and Womersley. Recreating a sense of community such as those envisaged in the ‘streets in the sky’ model of Park Hill seemed to be a fitting solution. However, despite planning to combine the social amenities afforded at Park Hill, such as self-contained shops and schooling, pubs, churches and bus stops, Wilson. H. & Womersley, J. L. (1970). Hulme Redevelopment – Area 5 Hulme Crescents, completed in 1972, lacked the focus on community that was integral to Womersley’s work in Sheffield. Park Hill had exploited the hills surrounding Sheffield city centre for practical and scenic effect: Manchester offered no such opportunity. Moreover, the population was effectively cut off from the rest of the city with the development of the Princess parkway and Mancunian Way; the new building techniques were poorly understood and imperfectly applied. Parkinson-Bailey, J. J. (2000). Manchester: An Architectural History. Manchester: Manchester University Press. The progressive collapse of Ronan Point high rise flats in London due to a gas explosion resulted in all similar concrete panel system-built schemes having to replace gas central heating with electric heating which tenants could not afford to use, leading to rampant condensation. The resultant problems with damp and poor sewerage system attracted vermin and social deprivation accompanied. They were demolished less than 20 years later. Working to a specification which did not support his investment in social facilities such as schools, leisure facilities and shops, left Womersley vulnerable to criticism levelled at creating structures that did not support communities. The rapid change of fortune and reputation that he suffered in the 1970s hurt him badly. Pass, Antony. (2011). Personal correspondence, 21 August 2011. and he returned his attention to single purpose structures. Commissioned by Manchester Corporation, Womersley was not afforded the freedom in private practice that he had enjoyed in Sheffield. Wilson & Womersley were employed to design the largest covered shopping centre of its time, the Arndale Centre [internal link], constructed in 1972 but were restricted by conflicts with the City Engineer and with the limiting specification that the display windows would be introspective, a feature which the architects warned, \\"would not be attractive.\\" Parkinson-Bailey, J. J. (2000). Manchester: An Architectural History. Manchester: Manchester University Press. This American-inspired design provoked the Bill Bryson to observe that the mustard tiles rendered the Arndale, \\"the world's largest gents' lavatory.\\" Ottewell, D. (2004). Lavatory Jibe Bryson Eats His Words. In Manchester Evening News 12 August 2004. In 1976, Womersley was appointed Chairman of the Albert Memorial Restoration Committee, which raised £50,000 to conserve the stonework and rescue the Albert Memorial, Albert Square, Manchester, from being dismantled by Manchester City Council. Memorial Committees had been set up throughout Britain following the death of Queen Victoria’s Consort in 1861 and the statue was designed by Matthew Noble, a statue set within a canopy in the style of the Scott monument in Edinburgh. The bricks were donated by the Manchester Brickmakers Protection Society and was unveiled in 1867 and gifted to the City of Manchester. However, a regular maintenance programme was not put in place and the monument deteriorated, partly from the iron railings being removed during the ‘Scrap for Victory’ campaign in World War II and the City Council resolved to dismantle it in 1971. Manchester’s Albert Memorial Appeal Committee was formed in February 1976 and appointed J. L. Womersley as its Chairman, with him, Antony Pass from the Planning Department. The committee were tasked to convince a city that a purely decorative and unfashionable monument which had been condemned not long before was worth salvaging by public subscription. The revenue for the original memorial was raised by public revenue, a fact noted in the inscription on the base of the memorial, and the funds for its restoration were also financed by public appeal, with car and lapel stickers produced to raise awareness.

It is listed as a Grade 1 Building of Special Architectural and Historic Interest. == Huddersfield == St. Paul's Concert Hall, Huddersfield 1980 The firm undertook re-design of the precinct of Huddersfield Polytechnic Campus and later in 1979, the conversion of St. Paul’s Church in Huddersfield into a concert hall. On awarding him a Fellowship for the redevelopment of the Campus in 1977, Dr. Stewart Armstrong, Deputy Rector, said of Womersley, \\"Only a planner with both vision and courage could have foreseen the Polytechnic campus as it is today. The splendid Central Services building stands as monument to that foresight\\". == The Lake District == In 1972 Wilson & Womersley published ‘Traffic Management in the Lake District National Park’ Wilson, H. & Womersley, J.L. (1972). Traffic Management in the Lake District National Park: A Report to the Friends of the Lake District. for Friends of the Lake District in which the terms of reference were, ‘To prepare a report on the problems raised by increasing motor traffic within the Lake District National Park and to suggest solutions for the present and future which will be in accordance with the preservation of the natural beauty of the Lake District and the rights of the public to enjoy it – an area close to Womersley’s heart, choosing to retire to Bowness-on-Windermere. Evoking the words of John Bunyan: Bunyan, J. (1678). The Pilgrim’s Progress. London: Penguin _I love to be in such places where there is no rattling with coaches, nor rumbling with wheels_ Wilson and Womersley conducted a detailed survey of the roads, traffic flow and natural beauty spots throughout Cumbria and proposed parking and traffic management solutions to balance the peak flow of tourist traffic with the preservation of the natural surroundings. The Practice had offices in London and Scotland and was as well known for town planning work as for architecture. In 1989, the Practice merged with the then largest architectural PLC in the country, D. Y. Davis, a company that collapsed during the recession of the nineties. J.L. Womersley began to present with symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease in 1971 and died in Glasgow on 28 October 1990. == Awards == 1933 Nicholson Travelling Scholarship. 1950 Ministry of Housing and Local Government Medal for parts of Kings Heath, Northampton. 1951 Builder competition, won with his Deputy, Geoffrey Hopkinson for the Hopley House.

Although she was initially appointed regent of her nine-year old daughter Shah Jahan Begum in 1844, she was recognized as nawab in 1860. During the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, Sikandar's pro-British stance made her a Knight Grand Commander. In 1863, she was the first Indian ruler to perform Hajj. Sikandar enacted many reforms in the state, including the creation of a mint, a secretariat, a parliament and a modern judiciary. ==Early life== Sikandar was born at Gauhar Mahal in Bhopal State, British India, on 10 September 1817. Her parents, Nasir Muhammad Khan and Qudsia Begum, were former nawabs of the state. ==Reign== On 3 January 1847, Sikandar Begum's nine-year old daughter Shah Jahan Begum ascended the throne of Bhopal. Joseph Davey Cunningham, political agent of the Governor-General of India, announced on 27 July of that year that Sikandar was appointed regent. The governor-general bestowed the state's executive powers on her. During the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, Sikandar sided with the British. To prevent rebellion in Bhopal, she banned the publication and circulation of anti-British pamphlets, strengthened her intelligence network, and bribed anti-British soldiers to switch sides. In August, however, a group of sepoys attacked British garrisons in Sehore and Berasia; anger with her increased in the state due to her pro- British stance. The same group of sepoys, encouraged by Sikandar's mother, surrounded her palace in December. Sikandar sent her son-in-law, Umrao Daulah, to negotiate with them. The soldiers ended their siege when she announced that their salaries would be increased. In 1861, Sikandar received the Knight Grand Commander award for her pro-British stance during the mutiny. The British recognized Sikandar as Nawab of Bhopal on 30 September 1860, and her military salute was increased to 19 guns the following year. ===Hajj=== In 1863, Sikandar was the first Indian monarch to perform Hajj. She was accompanied by about 1,000 people, mostly women. Sikandar wrote a memoir of her trip in Urdu, and an English translation was published in 1870. In the memoir, she wrote that the cities of Mecca and Jeddah were \\"unclean\\" and the Arabs and the Turks were \\"uncivilised\\" and \\"possessed no religious knowledge.\\" Also included in the memoir is an anecdote about her confrontation with Turkish customs officials who wanted to levy duties on everything she brought. ===Reforms=== Sikandar divided the state into three districts and 21 sub-districts. A revenue officer was appointed for each district and an administrator for each sub-district. She repaid the state's debt. Sikandar also established a customs office, a secretariat, an intelligence network, a mint, a postal service which connected the state with the rest of India, and a modern judiciary with a court of appeal. She founded the Victoria School for girls and at least one Urdu and Hindi middle school in each district of the state. Sikandar introduced a Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament) in 1847. Consisting of nobles and intellectuals, its purpose was to pass and recommend laws and to suggest reforms. In 1862, she replaced Persian with Urdu as the court language. ===Architecture=== Sikandar constructed a Moti Masjid (mosque) made of red sandstone, and built the Moti Mahal and Shaukat Mahal palaces. The latter was a blend of European and Indo-Islamic architecture, with Gothic features. ==Personal life== On 18 April 1835, Sikandar married Nawab Jahangir Mohammad Khan. They had one daughter, Shah Jahan Begum. Like her mother, Qudsia Begum, Sikandar was a devout Muslim; however, she did not wear the niqab (face veil) or practise purdah (female seclusion). She hunted tigers, played polo and was a swordsman, archer, and lancer. Sikandar commanded the army, and personally inspected courts, offices, the mint, and the treasury. Sikandar Begum died of kidney failure on 30 October 1868. She was buried at Farhat Afza Bagh, and was succeeded by her daughter as Nawab of Bhopal. ==References== Category:1817 births Category:1868 deaths Category:Indian monarchs Category:Muslim monarchs Category:Bhopal ==External links== * A pilgrimage to Mecca (London : W.

Aro uses fabric to create large scale installation pieces that are site specific. Aro also uses photographs, drawings, and videos in her exhibitions. Many of her works relate to ones perception of space and how one defines home or where they are from. == Biography == Aro was based in Spain for fifteen years, and now works in Milan, Italy where she also lives. Aro has been made a resident artist at many different galleries throughout Europe. Many of her pieces are installations that change the narrative of the original work or that change the viewers perception of the space. For example, in one installation Aro's uses fabric to change the narrative of a sculpture. In several other exhibitions she uses fabric to make it appear as though roots are going into the space. Thus changing the viewers perceptive of the space. Aro has spent many years outside of her home country Argentina, and has lived much of her life as a migrant in European countries. One of Aro's artworks the Red Net series is used to exemplify her time as a migrant and to relate and connect to other people who have lived in similar conditions as her. Aro has done many works relating to immigration, and opened an exhibition in Spain that touched on this topic as well. Her exhibition focused on the lives of immigrants and the hardships they endure. Her exhibition featured photographs of immigrants in the streets. Many of Aro's works are focused on one's relation to home, and the effect moving around has on a person. Aro also finds breaking gender stereotypes important, and would like to see a change in how women are viewed as submissive to men. She is especially interested in breaking from cultural stereotypes and roles men and women are put into. == Education == Elizabeth Aro attended the National school of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrredón in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Aro also attended the Universidad Nacional de las Artes (UNA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she majored in art history. == Artworks == === Dreaming in Red, 2019 === Made of deep red velvet. The color, once a symbol of passion and femininity, and a symbol of life that takes root among bronzes and plasters. Branches stretched towards the natural light, escape from the cage, their brilliant color contrasting with the subdued atmosphere of the studio in its shades of white, grey and black. Elizabeth Aro is part of the traditionally feminine heritage of textile and sewing work. This practice, which she subverts, allows her to create monumental pieces with grace and lightness. The artist has appropriated Henry Clews' universe; the branches of the tree evoke the tentacles of his fantastic creatures, and the leaves the plant motifs of his sculptures. It's possible to discover between the foliage the words \\"Mirth\\", \\"Myth\\" and \\"Mystery\\" ===Henry Clew's Cast, 2016=== Brocade fabric stuffed and sewn to make a vine or rope, and added to a sculpture. In this art piece, Aro adds brocade fabric to a sculpture by Henry Clew. Aro uses the fabric to make the main man in the sculpture look like he is holding some kind of rope that leads down to young children that are sculpted into the base of the sculpture. This art piece is meant to change the narrative of an art piece that has already been made by adding to it in some impermanent way. For example, before the addition of the fabric the sculpture had the young children reaching up to the man. With the addition of the fabric it looks as though the main figure is offering a way for the children to ride up to him. ===Santa Sangre, 2015=== Brocade Fabric stuffed and sewn together, done in a solo exhibition with nine other installations. In this piece Aro uses brocade fabric to create what appears to be reddish brown roots coming out of a door. This gives the appearance of nature coming indoors and taking over the space. This can be seen through the size of the roots in relation to the size of the room. With the positioning of the fabric piece it also appears as though the roots are continuing to grow and spread throughout the space. ===Mundo, 2016=== Made of layered felt. This piece is a large, white sphere that is meant to represent the world. The pieces composition is meant to represent the world falling apart. This can be seen through the way the land masses begin to fall south and jumble together. === Estudio de Nubes, 2014-2015 === Fifty-six pencil drawings. This art piece is a series of drawings of clouds, which the artist uses as a way to demonstrate time and memory. This is done through the way each column follows one part of the sky as it changes. The artist finds time and memory to be an integral part of her life, and associates time and memory with her experience of moving form one country to a new foreign one. === Ulivo, 2016 === Brocade fabric and cotton sewn together. This art piece is a sculpture in the shape of an all white tree. It is meant to symbolize life and the circle of life. The roots seen at the bottom of the piece are meant to visually symbolize the trees connection to the underworld. While the high reaching branches are meant to demonstrate its connection to the heavens or the celestial. This art installation piece often dominates the space that it is in due to its grand size. === Provvisorio per Sempre, 2013 === Made of fabric, skillfully sewn in white brocade and hold by a wooden structure. The installation, inspired by the 1961 movie \\"La Notte\\" of Michelangelo Antonioni, refers to a state of mind in which the built of our life is emotional and intuitive, a dimension that make us feel fragile about we thought we knew. === Red Net, 2009- 2017 === In this installation Elizabeth Aro analyses the appearance of cheating or deception, using a structure of an entangling net which is as delicate as consistent. With this, it shows a psychological dimension, thanks to the formal behaviour of the fabric used (velvet). The process of the spatial occupation of filaments gives the whole work a sense of internal rhythm, which are arises some plots, suspenden in the air and anamorfic shapes on the surface. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === *1999 Galeria Arteara, Madrid *2000 Instituto de America de Santa Fe, Granada *2001 De la Gente y el Paisaje, Casa Rivadavia, Cadiz *2002 Elizabeth Aro.

He had three sons; Bartolomeo, Benedetto and Jacomo. Bruti was married to Maria Bruni, of the Bruni family. Brutis brother, Antonio Bruni, was born in the 1550s. His son was Bartolomeo Bruti (1557-1591) who died in Moldavia from strangulation. Antonio Bruti was educated by the Jesuits. ==Career== During his career, Bruti bargained with the Ottomans the grain necessary to feed Catholic Venice.

Later he served the Ottoman fleet and between 1609 and 1624 he moved to live with his two sons and other Albanian sailors in the Karaburun Peninsula. During his sailing, he fought the French and Venetian fleets who seemed to control the Mediterranean. Haxhi Ali cooperated with many captains against foreign pirate attacks. The forests of Karaburun supplied Ali Hoxha with materials needed for the sea faring. According to folklore, Haxhi Alia roamed the coasts of Northern Africa and Misir of Spain. In the summer of 1623, outside of Otranto, Haxhi Alia collided with the ships of Venice and England. They aimed to wipe out all the pirates from the Mediterranean. Though they outnumbered him with powerful ships, Alia resisted and they could not break it or capture him. These battles made Alia a legend in Ulcinj and Tivar and he helped poor peasants financially so they could marry their daughters making him very popular. In the summer of 1625, Alis shepherds had gone out in the mountains and Karaburun was left empty with Alia was out in the seas. When he returned he encountered several ships which attacked him. Alia broke through the siege and docked his ship. The battle continued on land where Alia was killed on the Mountain of Fringe. When the shepherds returned, they mourned Alias death. Local peasants in the village sang heroic songs.

Crawford’s Town was in the Spanish River area of the parish of St George, now the western half of Portland Parish.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 59. ==First Maroon War== There were two main leaders of the Windward Maroons towards the end of the First Maroon War. They were Quao, who led the Maroons of Crawford's Town, and Queen Nanny, who marshalled the Maroons of Nanny Town. Their towns provided a safe haven to runaway slaves, who escaped from the sugar and coffee plantations of coastal Jamaica, and found refuge in the forested interior of the Blue Mountains (Jamaica). Quao and Nanny successfully led a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the British colonial forces throughout the 1730s, and succeeding governors were unable to win any decisive victories against them.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490-1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), pp. 117-283.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 88-118. When the British governor of Jamaica, Edward Trelawny, accepted that his armed forces would not be able to defeat the Jamaican Maroons of western (Leeward) Jamaica and eastern (Windward) Jamaica, he offered them treaties. In 1739, Trelawny offered a treaty to the Leeward Maroons, which was accepted and signed by their leader, Cudjoe. Once peace was agreed with the Leeward Maroons, Trelawny offered a treaty to the Windward Maroons in 1740, with support from Cudjoe and his forces. Quao signed the peace treaty, despite opposition from his ally, Nanny.Carey, Maroon Story, pp. 285-354.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 126-163. After the treaty of 1740, the colonial authorities of Jamaica referred to all the Windward Maroons as belonging to Crawford's Town. In terms of population, Crawford's Town was the second largest Maroon town, behind Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town) A colonial census taken of the Windward Maroons just after the treaty showed that they numbered about 300, and of that number, Crawford Town's population alone numbered 233.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 4, 56, 107-8. ==Crawford's Town Uprising== After the 1740 treaty, it appears that Quao and Nanny parted ways. It seems that Nanny took her supporters east to what would later become Moore Town on the eastern fringes of the Blue Mountains, while Quao took his people west to central Jamaica, and formed a community in a town that later came to be known as Crawford's Town on the western edge of the Blue Mountains. However, in about 1746, the white superintendents appointed by the British governors took control of Crawford's Town, and replaced Quao as the Maroon leader of that community. The new leader was another Maroon officer, Edward Crawford, after whom the town was eventually named.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 4, 54. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf In 1754, Quao and his supporters rose up in revolt, killed Ned Crawford, and captured the three white men who acted as superintendents in Crawford's Town. Governor Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet sent a militia detachment under the command of Lieutenant Ross to negotiate with Quao, but the Maroon leader spurned his offers, and reasserted Maroon control of Crawford's Town. Ross then secured the allegiance of the supporters of Crawford, as well as other Windward Maroons, and they defeated the minority of Maroons who supported Quao, capturing him, and killing a number of his Maroon officers.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 55-6.Carey, Maroon Story, pp. 416-8. It is not clear what happened to Quao, because he disappears from the records after Crawford's Town was destroyed. The supporters of Quao relocated to the neighbouring Maroon town of Scott's Hall (Jamaica), while the supporters of Crawford took up residence in the new Maroon community of Charles Town (Jamaica). The white superintendents took control of both Charles Town and Scott's Hall in the aftermath of the Crawford's Town uprising.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 56-7. ==Government of Crawford's Town== ===Maroon leaders=== c. 1740s Captain Quao c. 1750s Captain Edward CrawfordSiva, After the Treaties, p. 271. ===White superintendents=== c. 1745 George White c. 1748 Francis Ross c. 1752 William Trower c. 1754 John Kelly, Richard Godfrey and William KennedySiva, After the Treaties, p. 276. == References == Category:Jamaican Maroon establishments Category:Jamaican Maroons Category:Colony of Jamaica ","title":"Crawford's Town"},{"id":"60421248","text":"Demetrio Capuzzimati (Albanian: Dhimiter Këpucmadhi) (February 15, 1557, San Marzano di San Giuseppe) was an Albanian Stradiot captain in Apulia, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, and was the son of a soldier who had fought with Scanderbeg.

It won the Maverick Award for Quality in Low-Budget Filmmaking at the 13th Method Fest Independent Film Festival in Beverly Hills, March 2019. == Plot == Phyllis (Ivy Meehan), an aspiring fine artist, and Barry (Duncan Coe), an actor in a community theater, are living together in a small house in an Austin suburb. Barry receives a scathing review of his performance in a low- budget play on the same day that the play is closing. During the wrap party his co-star tries to convince him that all problems can be solved by the use of manifesting and the law of attraction. The next day, while at a gallery opening where her art is on display, Phyllis is confronted by a daft art fan who questions her work and makes her second guess her choice to be an artist. Later that night she overhears her boss talking to another patron as they criticize the work her boss previously praised. Phyllis takes her art from the wall of the gallery before storming out in defiance. That night, Barry confides in Phyllis that he wishes he could just take a vacation. As they drink a bottle of whiskey he and Phyllis jokingly \\"manifest\\" to the universe that they wish everyone would disappear and it could just be the two of them alone in the world. The next morning, Barry goes to check for his newspaper as he always does to discover it hasn't been delivered. He drives to his local convenience store to find it closed. He begins to notice that nobody else is out on the streets. He returns home to confront Phyllis, suspecting they had forgotten about a national holiday, and he and Phyllis head out into the city to investigate. They find the city streets empty with no signs of life. They determine that their \\"manifesting\\" worked. Barry falls asleep in the back yard to the light of the moon. The next morning, Barry discovers a previously unknown stream behind their house that leads to a grotto and swimming hole. At home Phyllis wakes to discover Barry is missing and fearing he disappeared too she has a panic attack and nearly asphyxiates in their yard. Barry returns and she chastises him for leaving. Reunited they bask in their newfound freedom. Phyllis spends the next several days delving into her artwork while Barry goes stir crazy. Soon the power goes out in the house and the summer heat begins to suffocate them in their home. Suffering from cabin fever they set off to spend some time in the woods behind their house. While away from their home Barry doubles-down on his questioning of their purpose in life, the nature of art, and the need for human contact while Phyllis is content with living out the rest of their days alone together. On their journey back to the house they become lost in the woods and spend the night in the shade of a cliff. Barry has an epiphany and makes Phyllis \\"manifest\\" again but that this time they should wish they were back in civilization with their old lives. Phyllis gives a half-assed attempt at manifesting which doesn't work. The next day they continue to travel through the woods in order to find their home but the long journey becomes tiresome and Barry's spirit is defeated. They resign themselves to the idea that all of civilization is now gone and it's really just the two of them left in the woods alone. Phyllis attempts to convince Barry that they're better off together. Barry continues to spiral into a depression and confesses that he doesn't like their new reality and he wishes they were no longer stuck in the woods. Barry sleeps that night under Phyllis' watchful eye. The next morning they wake to find the forest has disappeared and they're in the middle of a barren desert. Barry's sanity breaks and he accepts his new desolate reality. He and Phyllis play make-believe in the desert sand and imagine they got that vacation after all and they bask in the breeze of a coastal ocean. In the desert Phyllis exclaims that she got exactly what she wanted: to be with Barry. He has a final epiphany and comes to realize that everything they've experienced has been Phyllis' doing. She was the one who wished away everyone in the universe, wished away all civilization, and manifested away the forest which leads to them being alone in a desert. Barry confronts Phyllis about her controlling their reality and she denies his claim that she's selfishly acting for her own happiness. He runs from her and she gives chase. He falls and tumbles down a hill where he hits his head on a piece of driftwood. She mourns over his lifeless body and eschews all her former decisions but the damage is already done and Barry perishes. Phyllis' conscience is left lifeless in blackness and she's must live out her days alone, just as she wished the night she manifested all the people out of the world. == Cast == * Ivy Meehan as Phyllis * Duncan Coe as Barry * Anna Schatte as Jamie * Danielle Evon Ploeger as Suzie * Marco Perella as Steve * Pamela L.

He worked for the Venetians, Philip II of Portugal, Habsburg Spain, the Queen of England,Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-Century Mediterranean World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 358 the Principality of Moldavia, Zygmund III Vasa and the Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha to whom he was related. He was the son of a cavalry captain in the Venetian employ. Bartolomeo Bruti married Maria de Pleba, a relative of the imperial Matthias del Faro. Their son, Antonio was born in 1578. In 1573 Bartolomeo Bruti, aged 16, sent a petition to Venice after having been trained in Carigrad to become a giovane de lingo, or a Venetian agent. In 1575 he returned to Rome after having learned the Ottoman-Turkish language. Between 1574 and 1579, he worked for the Spanish on a mission to establish a truce in the Mediterranean between the two great powers Venice and the Ottoman Empire. He also worked as a spy for the Venetians fixing deals with the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha to whom he worked for. After the Battle of Lepanto, Mehmed Bey Paşa, governor of Algeria (1567–1568), was captured by the Venetians. He was released after Bruti negotiated a deal. Together with Sokollu who gave him secret information, Bruti made a deal with the Habsburg authorities to spy on Ottoman military activity.Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-Century Mediterranean World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 511 Bartolomeo proposed a new deal; if Philip II of Portugal could offer Sokollu 30,000 ducats then they could bribe Ottoman officials to eventually create an anti-Ottoman alliance in North Africa, particularly in Algeria. In 1575, he traveled to Rome as part of a mission to exchange 34 Ottoman prisoners of war between the forces of the league that had participated in the Battle of Lepanto and the Ottoman Empire. First he traveled to Fermo, then to Ragusa where the Ottomans were to surrender the Christian prisoners. In 1576, he offered to send letters via Cattaro and Ragusa rather than Corfu and change the Greek couriers with Slavs. He also notified Sinan Pasha of a Spanish agent named Antonio Sanz who arrived in Constantinople in 1582. Luckily for Sanz, he had a salvoconducto given by Uluç Ali. Yet he still had to leave the city and his wife and children in it immediately. The unofficial Habsburg ambassador named Giovanni Margliani offered to the Viceroy of Naples to send two assassins named Sinan and Haydar to kill Bartolomeo Bruti for his double game. The offer was declined as Bruti was neither a vassal nor a renegade. Bruti met his end in 1591 after the Moldavian prince Aron Tiranul (1591–1595) strangled Bruti who at the time was around 30 years old. Tiranul had borrowed money from Bruti and refused to pay it back. Bruti was a Machiavelian type who played on many sides simultaneously. == Diplomat and councilor == In his youth, Bruti worked as a spy for the Venetians on the streets of Pera in Constantinople. He also worked for the Spanish forcing him to act \\"double agent\\".Lo spionaggio sulla frontiera mediterranea nel XVI secolo: la Sicilia contro il sultano. (translation: Albanian of origin and \\"young of language\\" at the Venetian embassy in Constantinople, the spy implemented in the streets of Pera \\"de baxo de la dissimulacion con que antes estava del servicio de Venecianos\\". But the adventurous biography of Brutti was the most striking example of the risks faced by intelligence Hispanic when he established contacts with characters who had means to play the double game), 2016. p. 485. In the summer of 1546, Bruti and Mariano di Lipari landed on Trapani pier with valuable information for the Sicilian government. Bruti became known for saving Petru Şchiopul and in return he made Bruti a secret chancellor and advisor. Bruti brought his two brothers Cristoforo and Benedetto to Moldava giving them land. The Moldovan bolsheviks feared him. In 1579, Iancu Sasul (Saon) took advantage of Şchiopul and borrowed money from Bruti. Sasul soon fell out of favour with the Porte and was decapitated in 1582 at the border to Poland at Lviv. Şchiopul gave the title of cubicularius to Brutti who exercised influence on both Şchiopul and Mihnea II, the renegade of Wallachia, nephew of Şchiopul. Bruti wrote to the Pope asking for spiritual shepherds (Franciscans and Jesuits, from Poland) in order to increase the number of Catholics of 15,000 who were to fight Transylvanias \\"heretics\\" (protestans and hussites). Bruti helped seize the Hussites churches giving them to the Jesuits. On January 14, 1587, Bruti wrote a letter from Iași to Annibal de Capua: \\"These Franciscans are very few and they speak neither German, nor Hungarian, so they can't take spiritual care of these catholics, 15000 in number\\". Bruti was associated with the later Pope Sixtus V and Pope Gregory XIV. Bruti was active in other fields, and instead of promoting affairs of Venice and serving Spain, during the Portuguese dynastic crisis, he designed a venture by the Ottomans against Spain in favour of the Portuguese aspirant to the throne, the home of Anton I. Bruti maintained contact with the Queent of England who supported the Porte. In August 1584, Bruti sent 6,000 Hungarian ducats to his wife in Venice and he enabled good trade with the Romanians through his brothers In 1590, Bruti was admitted to the Polish nobility. The Ottoman-Polish peace talks were conducted that year through the mediation of England, with the capture of Bartolomeo Bruti, \\"agent del Principe di Moldavia\\", in Warsaw and Constantinople. To his old friend, Dubrovnik resident Tomi Nadali, a physician and the Krakow canon, Brutti had previously confided in himself: \\"ancor io ho di figlioli et vorrei vedere qualche premio di questa mia servitù.\\" when he became Duke (1574-1579), he summoned Bruti, conferring on him the title of secret chancellor and advisor, and, as a diplomat for both the duchy and the port, played an important role in the political life of Moldova. Bartolomeo brought two of his brothers, Cristoforo and Benedetto, with him to Moldova, where he was also granted landed estates. The position gave him so much power that he was feared by the Moldovan Bolsheviks. In 1579, Iancu Sasul (Saxon) took advantage of the weakened position of iopchiopul and, by borrowing money from Bruti, came to his. the Nuncio to Poland to provide spiritual shepherds (Franciscans and Jesuits, especially from Poland) with the Archbishop of Lviv for perhaps a slightly increased number of 15,000 Catholics who would fight Transylvania's \\"heretics\\" (Protestants, Hussites) settled Hungarians and Germans. In November 1588, as chamberlain of the Duke of Brest of Moldova, he informed the papal nuncio in Poland that the Duke had secured the Jesuits by giving them two other Hungarian villages, which were Brutti's. Bartolomeus Brutus himself helped to drive \\"heretics\\" and married priests from Catholic churches and parishes there. Bruti and Sokollu met in Istanbul and they quickly established a connection. However they soon became rivals as they competed for the influence on the Sultan, and Sokollu arrested Bruti in his own castle accusing him of being a spy and threatening him with forced conversion to Islam. The real reason behind Bruti's arrest was that he contained secret information on two of Sokollu's men, Hurrëm Bey, a Spanish agent, and Solomon, who were in fact Muslims and pretended to be Christians. Despite threats, Bruti refused to convert. Eventually Bruti was released by the intervention of the Sultan. == Iancu Sasul, Petru Schiopul and Bruti == Bruti was accused of being a traitor by the Ottomans and for having intervened in the election of the prince of Moldavia. He was forced to return to Naples where he was punished by the Spanish authorities. He returned to Istanbul and entered the service of the Moldavian prince Iancu Sasul. However, later he would betray Sasul for Petru Schiopul where he became the grand customs officer. In the spring of 1586, the French traveler François de Pavie de Fourquevaux arrived in Iaşi and met Bruti who initiated a currency exchange operation as Bruti was known as \\"the great merchant\\". Bruti gave Fourquevaux a payment order to be extracted in Lwów at grand customs officer Sima Vorsi. When arriving after six days, the Frenchman was told that the documents were not useful. Fourquevaux was upset, however, Romanian studies of this event does not conclude if Bruti tricked Fourquevaux or if Sima Vorsi did as both merchants had interests of their own. It also turned out that the Frenchman was in Moldavia for \\"pleasure\\". Constantine Vorsi, son of Sima Vorsi, at the age of 15, committed a murder during school, and he escaped punishment thanks to the involvement of Bartolomeo Bruti and his brother Bernardo Bruti. On May 6, 1590, Bruti sent with a Turkish convoy to make peace between Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The Polish were grateful to Bruti and the chancellor Jan Zamoyski proposed that he should be granted Polish naturalization. From this moment on he became involved in the appointment of the Voivod (princely ruler) of the Ottoman client state of Moldavia. In 1582 he was commissioned to go to Constantinople to bring unusual gifts on the occasion of the circumcision festival for the son of the Sultan Murad III. In 1590, he was chosen as the official envoy in Poland on behalf of Sinan Pasha. Mieczysław Brahmer states that Zamoyski, Bartolomeo Bruti and the hospodar Pietro lo Zoppo, left no stone unturned to bribe, with the sum of 50,000 thalers, Sinan Pasha and other pashaliks. == Sabotage mission and the Spanish agent == In 1574, the Spanish agent Martin de Acuña was captured during the Ottoman conquest of Tunisia. He came to Madrid in 1576 after he was rescued from slavery. He was sent to the Deputy King of Naples where he met Bruti, a mediator like himself. Though Acuna and Bruti had conflicting interests. Acuna was set out for a sabotage mission, however Bruti protested but the King of Naples did not listen and sent Acuna to Istanbul. In 1576, Bruti was in Naples where he met Martín de Acuña. He told Bruti he was on his way to Istanbul for a sabotage mission which Bruti vehemently opposed saying that by the time the agent arrived in Istanbul, the Ottoman ships would already be at sea and not at bay as Acuña believed. In the spring of 1577, Martín de Acuña from Valladolid guaranteed the possibility of a hidden truce with the Ottoman Empire, while Bruti delivered the letters of Mehmet Bey of Algeria, an act of betrayal to the Sultan. Acuna decided that Bruti was valuable due to his knowledge of the Turkish language. However, Acuna withdrew from this idea and called for Spanish authorities to arrest Bruti. In interrogation, Bruti claimed to be a Venetian spy who had been sent to Italy by the Jewish merchant and Ottoman official Joseph Micas. The Spanish saw through his lies and later Bruti admitted and explained that his real mission was to persuade Philip II to restore Mehmed Bey Paşa, the Governor-General of Algeria (1567–1568), son of a previous king of Algiers, Ali Pasha (Salah Rais), to power in Algiers. Bruti and Acuna argued and confused Philip II with contradictory statements on how to rescue the Christian slaves captured in Istanbul and how to attack the Ottoman fleet. Bruti feared that if the Ottoman fleet was assaulted the Ottomans would know that Bruti arranged it. Philip II eventually believed that establishing Mehmet Bey as king in Algiers was a good idea and decided to send Bruti back to Istanbul to continue negotiations. In 1580, the French ambassador Jacques de Germigny (1579–1585) reported from Istanbul to Henry III of France that Bruti, who had been used by Spanish agent Don Marillano, working for Philip II of Spain, was arrested in Lezina (La Zenia) after having been tipped off by several drunken individuals who were crying due to the death of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. == Zygmund III Vasa, Venetians and the Spanish == During his contract with Venice, he helped the Ottomans make a plan against Spain in favor of the Portuguese king Antonio I of Portugal. On June 1, 1587, Bruti maintained contact with Elizabeth I, the Queen of England. The Queen supported the Portuguese succession supporter Philip II, thinking about the 1585 military venture with Murad III against a common enemy, and especially at the time of the preparation of the Spanish fleet, which in 1588 ordered the invasion of England, primarily because of the assistance it provided to Spain in the Netherlands. According to Bruti, the English had interests in gaining influence in the Ottoman Empire against the Habsburgs. Bruti also was interested in gaining the Queen's support in order to influence the British ambassador in Constantinople securing Petru Schiopul's throne. Bruti also maintained contact with the King of Poland, Zygmund III Vasa (1587–1632) and Moldavia, in order to attract Queen Elizabeth's attention and to establish a Catholic Polish Jesuit order. == Habsburg, Wallachia and Queen Elizabeth == Vienna had much interest in working with Bartolomeos Bruti's relative Antonio Bruti due to the popularity and knowledge of the family. Because of Bruti's close ties to Sinan Pasha and the Habsburg authorities, the English ambassador in Istanbul tried to make use of him. In 1591, the Habsburg authorities sent an agent to Koper to speak with Bartolomeo's family. Queen Elizabeth received letters from Bartolomeo Bruti on June 1, 1587, which, according to Edward Barton, English ambassador of Istanbul, flattered the queen because her name had reached all the way to Moldavia and Vallachia. Bruti sent her a letter titled Manu proprai in the late summer of 1590. Barton, the Queens man, said ”The Albanian, who in his missive offered his services for the future, had long desired to see the English court”. Bruti had been in contact with the Queen since 1587. On October 2, 1590, Queen Elisabeth sent a letter to Bruti thanking him for having halted the war between Poland and the Ottomans as it otherwise would have had \\"serious impact on the English munitions trade\\". Brutis political skills and diplomacy with the Queen enabled an improved trade between England and Moldavia. On August 27, 1588, Bruti, representing Peter of Moldavia, enabled privileges for English merchants and the English queens representant Master William Hareborn returned with the letters given to him by Bruti from Constantinople. == Prisoner exchange and betrayal == During the prisoner exchange, Bruti had rescued Gabrio Serbelloni, who was the uncle of Giovanni Marliani, a Spanish agent. During this period, Bartolomeo Bruti was traveling with Giovanni to Constantinople as they were good friends. There, he changed plans offering to escape with Marliani to Anatolia while telling Sokollu Mehmed Pasha other plans. Bruti had made a deal with the Habsburg authorities to help Marliani on the one hand and on the other continue negotiating with Sinan Pasha. They arrived in Istanbul in late 1577 and negotiated a three-year truce in February 1581. Bruti and Marliani did not fancy each other and tried excluding one another. Bruti then made a plan to get rid of him. First, he told Marliani that Sokollu was angry at him for the misinformation regarding the arrival of a Habsburg official and that Marliani should ask Sokollu for permission to leave. If this plan did not work, Bruti would wait until the Sultan went out hunting and then go and speak to the Sultans men in Albanian, which Marliani did not understand. Marliani refused to leave and Bruti told the Sultan that Marliani was plotting against the Ottomans. Marliani was appalled by Brutis ”betrayal”. == Imprisonment == Bruti did not succeed influencing everyone and was eventually imprisoned by the Sultan after it was discovered that he had lied. Marliani was in a difficult situation; on the one hand, Philip II had instructed him to work with Bruti. Marliani was also afraid that Bruti would convert to Islam out of fear and then share all the secrets. Marliani sent Ottoman grand dragoman Hurrëm Bey, an agent paid by the Spanish, who was to argue claiming that Bartolomeo actually arrived with Hurrem Bey and that he should be treated with respect. If Bruti was executed, negotiation would fail. Sokollu insisted that Bruti be impaled. Sinan Pasha, who had previously received 8,000 ducats from the Moldavian throne thanks to Brutis negotiations, knew that Sokollu only wanted the throne for himself. Sinan Pasha therefore quickly made a petition claiming that Sokollu was actually trying to punish Bruti for his ”politics”, Sokollu, however, decided to try and convince the Sultan that Bruti was a Habsburg spy and tried to forge a letter written by the Viceroy of Naples who ”thanked the Albanese for the information he had sent”. Sinan Pasha then made another petition claiming that Sokollus closest physician, a Jewish man named Solomon Ashkenazi, deceived Marliani into submitting a document with no credit. Sokollu eventually released Bruti on the condition that he was to return to Naples. Sokollu never liked Bruti because he was plotting with Sinan Pasha in favor of a Moldavian prince and was accused by Sokoll Mehmet Pasha, a statesman of high Ottoman status, of being a traitor. Sokollu tried to order the execution of Bruti but was prohibited by Sinan Pasha due to Bruti's access to valuable information. Nevertheless, he was arrested and released with the condition that he return to Naples and be punished by the Habsburg authorities. Unfavorable winds saved Bruti from a possible shipwreck and he remained on a Ragusan island where he passed on to Lezhë to his home city. Here he was detained by the Ragusan men sent by Marliani. == Murder == Before he reached Naples, he returned to Constantinople and began his opposition against Marliani, trying to contact Ottoman officials warning them that Marliani was trying to buy time rather than make a truce. Bruti's attempts proved futile and he left to join the service of the new voivode Iancu Saul. Here he became a successful statesman and help avoid a possible Ottoman-Polish war. In October 1578, Bruti went to Sokollu to warn him about Marlianis connections with the Spanish. According to the chronicles of Polish poet and diplomat Joachim Bielski in 1591, Bruti (known as Brutti Epirote or Arnaut Brutti) was arrested and thrown in prison in Dniester. He was imprisoned in Moldavia and tried to flee to a local ruler over the Polish border. His nose was cut off and he was strangled when he was in his 30s by the new prince Aron Tiranul (1591–1595) who had borrowed money from Bruti and refused to pay it back. The execution was also ordered by the Ottoman authorities. His nephew, Pasquale Bruti, was killed in 1598 by the Ottomans in Belgrade for suspicion of being a spy. == References == Category:1557 births Category:1591 deaths Category:Albanian diplomats Category:People from Ulcinj Category:People from Lezhë Category:Albanian spies ","title":"Bartolomeo Bruti"},{"id":"60421307","text":"Blewcoat School Map of Caxton Street Caxton Street is a street in the City of Westminster in London that runs between Buckingham Gate in the west and Broadway in the east.

As of 4 June 2020, the Government of National Accord has regained control over all of Tripoli and the LNA forces have withdrawn from the capital, after fourteen months of fighting. The offensive resulted in over 2,356 dead. It began on 4 April 2019, 10 days before the Libyan National Conference for organising presidential and parliamentary elections in Libya had been planned to take place, and five days after the first session of the 2019 Libyan local elections was held successfully. As a result of the offensive, United Nations Support Mission in Libya postponed the forthcoming Libyan National Conference. War crimes and crimes against humanity that take place during the conflict are covered by the mandate of the International Criminal Court investigation in Libya under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970. == Background == Situation in western Libya before the April 2019 LNA offensive Following the overthrow and death of Muammar Gaddafi and the fall of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in 2011, political and military control in Libya were in a state of flux. Fighting between different factions escalated in 2014, with the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, being the main political force claiming to be the legitimate government of Libya. The House of Representatives was supported by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army. In early 2016 a rival government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), was established in Tripoli with the backing of the UN and several countries. There were multiple attempts to negotiate between the two governments and organise new elections throughout 2017 and 2018. Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj met and spoke with each other twice for negotiations, in November 2018 and February 2019. The Supreme Judicial Council of Libya, created in 2011, retained its structure as a single national body despite the political split, and in 2019 went through Libya-wide \\"transparent elections\\" and a \\"peaceful transfer of power\\". Face-to-face consultations with 7,000 Libyans and online consultations with 130,000 Libyans during 2018–2019, coordinated by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, led to a plan to hold the Libyan National Conference in Ghadames during 14–16 April 2019 in order to recommend to the Libyan House of Representatives and High Council of State methods and dates for holding 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections in Libya. The first batch of the 2019 municipal elections in Libya took place on 30 March 2019. Other aims of the conference, to which representatives of all political factions were invited, included creating a unity government between Sarraj and Haftar and proposing a framework for creating a new constitution. In March 2019, the advance of Haftar's forces in southern Libya during the preceding few months started to cause concern for the organisers of the conference. Ghassan Salamé, head of UNSMIL, stated on 4 April 2019 that the conference would be postponed because of the outburst of military events, but that it would be held > \\"as soon as possible because we do not have the right to allow this historic > opportunity to be corrupted. At the same time, we cannot ask for the > presence of the Conference, with the [cannons] firing and the raids ongoing, > without making sure that all those who are willing to respond to this > historic national duty from all regions of the country are able to ensure > their safety and freedom by expressing their opinion.\\" On 4 April 2019, an audio recording was published on Facebook by Marshal Haftar declaring war on the UN-recognised Government of National Accord and announcing that the LNA would militarily take over the capital city Tripoli. In response, the government in Tripoli, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and the Presidential Council ordered a general mobilisation of all of its security forces. On 6 April, Prime Minister Sarraj, as supreme commander of the Libyan Army, created a joint operations room under the western military region commander, Major General Osama al-Juwaili, to coordinate their operations.PC President forms joint military operations room as war rocks Tripoli yet again. Libya Observer. Published 6 April 2019. Retrieved 30 April 2019. === International (non-UNSMIL) === From early 2015, during the years prior to the April 2019 attack on Tripoli, Haftar received long-term support from French authorities, including French \\"advisers, clandestine operatives, and special forces\\" helping the LNA's military operations in the east and south of Libya. Three of the French special-forces soldiers died in a helicopter accident near Benghazi in July 2016. Bloomberg News stated that the al-Sarraj administration had long-term support from Italian authorities. The Economist argued that a May 2018 meeting between al-Sarraj and Haftar, hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron in the context of French-Italian rivalry with regards to Libya, \\"undermined\\" the efforts of Ghassan Salamé in facilitating the organising of the Libyan National Conference by Libyans. The Economist pointed to the Greenstream pipeline natural gas pipeline and French and Italian crude oil interests in Libya as significant factors in the two countries' relations with Libyan political forces in 2018. Bloomberg News described Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as \\"backers\\" of Haftar. Prior to the LNA attack on Tripoli, the Saudi Arabian government gave twenty million US dollars to the LNA in support of the attack, \\"to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders, recruit and pay fighters, and other military purposes.\\" On 27 December 2019 Bloomberg News reported that Turkey intended to deploy its navy to protect Tripoli and send troops to help train GNA forces. Additionally Turkmen rebel groups fighting in northern Syria were expected to transfer to Tripoli. By 29 December, 650 Syrian National Army personnel (also called: Syrian National Army) had arrived in Libya and were stationed on the eastern frontline in Tripoli. == The campaign == ===2019=== ====April==== ;4 April On the first day of the offensive, 4 April 2019, the LNA captured Gharyan. Haftar urged pro-GNA militias to surrender, saying \\"Those who lay down their weapons are safe, and those who raise the white banner are safe.\\" Interior minister Fathi Bashagha condemned the offensive, declaring that \\"We will not be subdued by any use of force by any side or any person. And if anyone is willing to use force against us we're ready for sacrifice but we will not give up on democracy which we've always wanted from the beginning.\\" ;5 April On 5 April, the Libyan National Army stated that they had captured Qasr bin Ghashir, Wadi al-Rabie and Suq al-Khamis.

As part of the operation Volcano of Anger launched by GNA, Mistrata militias mobilized on the frontlines of Tripoli to prevent the LNA from capturing it. LNA forces under Hifter conducted an airstrike against the GNA-held Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli, Libya's last functioning civilian airport, on 8 April. The closure left Misrata Airport, located 200 km (125 miles) to the east down the coast, as the nearest airport for Tripoli residents. UN special representative for Libya Ghassan Salamé condemned the attack as \\"a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\\" Wolfram Lacher, a scholar of Libya at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that the strike showed Hifter's willingness \\"to reduce Tripoli to rubble so that he can rule Libya, which is the only option he has left now anyway.\\" Flights were temporarily suspended; by 9 April, a coalition of local and regional militias and GNA forces had pushed Hifter's forces from the airport, and flights resumed, with clashes continuing in multiple locations on the southern fringes of Tripoli.

On June 11, the United Nations expressed concern regarding reports of the discovery of eight mass graves in the town of Tarhuna; according to GNA officials, 160 bodies were discovered and retrieved by the Libyan Red Crescent. == Strategic analysis == According to the Middle East Institute, the LNA's offensive against Tripoli has resulted in an increased destabilization of Libya, allowing the local forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to regain some strength in southern Libya. As a result of the fighting between the LNA and GNA-backed militias, both did less to suppress ISIL while creating new power vacuums which radical Jihadists were likely to exploit. == Casualties == The UN's World Health Organization reported over 2,280 dead by mid-January 2020, of which over 2,000 were confirmed as combatants and 280 as civilians. The civilian death toll was reported to have reached 356 by the end of March 2020.

The mercenaries were trained in Turkey and send to Libya. == Human rights abuses == === Legal aspects and documentation === Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970, the International Criminal Court (ICC) can carry out investigations and prosecutions into claims of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide if the crimes are claimed to occur in Libya on or later than 15 February 2011. , the ICC had two outstanding warrants for the arrest of LNA commander Mahmoud al-Werfalli, for involvement in the alleged killings in and near Benghazi of 33 people during June 2016 to July 2017 and for allegedly executing ten people \\"in front of a cheering crowd\\" in Benghazi between 23 and 25 January 2018. In reference to the 2019 Western Libya offensive, ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda stated on 11 April that the ICC \\"[wouldn't] hesitate\\" to issue arrest warrants for people suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 16 April, Bensouda gave more details, stating that both those directly committing war crimes in Libya and their commanders would be liable to prosecution by the ICC, including anyone \\"ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing in any other manner to the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court\\". According to Human Rights Watch, both the GNA and LNA military forces had prior records of human rights abuses, with \\"a well-documented record of indiscriminate attacks on civilians, summary executions of captured fighters, and arbitrary detention\\" by LNA forces and evidence of abuses of civilians by GNA forces, prior to 4 April 2019 attack on Tripoli. Al-Sarraj stated on 17 April that the GNA would provide documentation to the ICC regarding 16 April Grad shelling of residential areas that killed at least seven people and wounded 17, for which he claimed Haftar was responsible. On 2 May, a spokesperson for the GNA, Muhanad Younis, stated that administrative responsibility had been allocated for documenting war crimes during the Western Libya offensive and providing the documentation to the ICC.

Images of al-Kikli's mutilated body circulated on social media. During 15–17 April 2019, rocket attacks using inaccurate technology occurred against three densely populated residential areas in and near the Abu Salim area of Tripoli, and were interpreted by Amnesty International (AI) as \\"unlawful attacks that could amount to war crimes\\". Based on information from witnesses and satellite imaging, AI stated that those launching the rockets \\"failed to take necessary precautions to protect civilian lives and civilian objects\\". AI identified the areas hit as Hay al-Intissar, in which five rockets hit five homes killing five adults and wounding a girl; Hay Salahaddin; and the \\"Kikla buildings\\", where three rockets hit a construction company, a residential building and the ground, wounding two people. Thomson Reuters journalists stated that 16 April Grad shelling of residential areas killed at least seven people and wounded 17. AI found no evidence for any military targets in any of the attacks and could not \\"conclusively determine\\" which armed group was responsible for the attacks. Abu Salim residents attributed the attack to the LNA. Magdalena Mughrabi of AI recommended on the basis of the attacks that the ICC investigate possible war crimes by all parties involved in the 2019 Western Libya offensive. She stated, \\"The use of artillery and other imprecise weapons such as GRAD-style rockets in civilian areas is prohibited under international humanitarian law and such indiscriminate attacks can amount to war crimes.\\" On 2 May, BBC Arabic published its enquiry into apparent war crimes carried out during the attack on Tripoli that had been widely circulated on Facebook.

On 2 July 2019, an airstrike hit the Tajoura Detention Center outside Tripoli, while hundreds of people were inside the facility. It killed at least 53 of them and injured 130 others. UNSMIL suspected that the mass killing of civilians was a war crime. On 27 July 2019, an airstrike on a field hospital near the capital Tripoli killed five doctors, and wounded seven other people. The attack is believed to have been carried out by LNA aircraft. On 4 August, an airstrike by the LNA against a wedding in Murzuk killed 43 people and injured 60. The European External Action Service commented on the civilian deaths at Murzuk and referred to the legal principle that \\"indiscriminate attacks on densely populated residential areas\\" may constitute war crimes. UNSMIL described 18 November aerial attack on a biscuit factory at Wadi Rabi'a in Tripoli, which killed ten people, as a possible war crime. ===Legal cases=== On 26 June 2019, four Libyan families filed a lawsuit in the United States (US) federal court against Haftar for war crimes that took place during the 2019 Western Libya offensive, seeking million in damages and compensation. The lawsuit alleged that Haftar was responsible for \\"torture, mass murder, indiscriminate destruction of civilian property and genocide\\". == Reactions == === Domestic === Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, also the chairman of the GNA's Presidential Council, accused Haftar of betraying them and launching a coup d'état.GNA head accuses Haftar of 'betrayal', vows to end Tripoli push.

He was the uncle of Bartolomeo Bruti. Members of the family worked for the Venetians, the Papacy and the Ottomans. Ottoman conquest of the city forced Bruni eventually to flee to Venice where he was educated by the Jesuits in May 1572 in Rome and he was a doctorate in Avignon. He also worked for one of his cousins in Moldavia. Bruni's father was Gasparo Bruni, the first knight of Malta and the commander of the Papacys fleet during the Battle of Lepanto. In august 1591, Bruni returned to Koper and was elected as the overseer of the grain store. == Petru Schiopul == Petru Schipoul, Voivod of Moldavia, abandoned his throne and fled to Habsburg territory where he contacted Bruni in Koper in 1592, according to a letter which Bruni presented to the elected pope Clement VIII in Rome. Before Petru Schipouls decision to leave, he received a loan of 11,300 ducats in advance from a Ragusan merchant in Moldavia named Giovanni de Marini Poli who had come to collect sheep and cattle.REVUE DES ÉTUDES SUD-EST EUROPÉENNES, p. 74 However Schipoul fled and the new Voivode Aron refused to pay his predecessors debts. Marini Poli pursued Petru for the money and in May 1593, Antonio Bruni traveled to Bolzano where Petru was and made him sign a legal document empowering Antonio to speak and act on Petrus behalf. This proved that Antonio was fluent in Romanian. For seven months Bruni stayed in Tyrol helping Petru with his legal defense in court against Marini Poli. In 1594 Petru died and his family members stripped the house of possessions which Bruni opposed. He also felt a special responsibility for the son of Petru, Stefan. In 1596 he submitted a memorandum to the Austrians suggesting an anti-Ottoman geostrategic plan. == Death == It is believed that Antonio Bruni died from the plague during his travels between Koper and Bolzano in Trieste July 1598. Bruni was the first Albanian to write a general description of Albania which was a major source of information in Lazaro Soranzos L’Ottomanno (1598). Antonio Bruni had an insiders view of the empire; his work had taken him to such places as Vlorë, on the southern coast of Albania, and Constanta, on the Black Sea coast, and he also stayed in Moldavia.

It has an distinctive cyclohexane moiety and has been proposed as a specific biomarker for pelagic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Structurally, the molecule consists of two long hydrocarbon chains that extend through the cell membrane and are bound on each to glycerol through ether linkage. Crenarchaeol can be preserved for hundreds of millions of years in the environment and is part of the TEX86 paleothermometer, a temperature proxy for sea surface temperatures that has been used to reconstruct paleoclimate through to the middle Jurassic (~160 Ma). == Discovery and distribution== Archaeal membranes are distinct from those of bacteria and eukaryotes because they contain isoprenoid GDGTs instead of diacyl lipids, which are found in the other domains. It has been proposed that GDGT membrane lipids are an adaptation to the high temperatures present in the environments that are home to extremophile archaea and so researchers were met with surprise in 1997 when unknown archaeal GDGTs were detected in pelagic waters. Unknown GDGTs were also found in marine sediments and isolated from Cenarchaeum symbiosum, a marine ammonia-oxidizing archaeon that lives in symbiosis with sponges. Following the discovery of GDGTs outside of hydrothermal environments, crenarchaeol was first identified as the major GDGT component in surface sediments and extracts from C. symbiosum in 2002 by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy. It was named for the phylum Crenarchaeota, to which the ammonia-oxidizing pelagic archaea that produce crenarchaeol were thought to belong before it was proposed that the Marine Group I Crenarchaeota be considered a distinct phylum, Thaumarchaeota. Crenarchaeol was originally thought to be produced only in pelagic ocean environments, but researchers have since discovered that it is also produced by archaea living in high temperature environments including hot springs like this one. Crenarchaeol is produced by AOA belonging to the phylum Thaumarchaeota (formerly classified as the Marine Group 1 Crenarchaeota). It has been confirmed to be produced by pure cultures of the pelagic mesothermic C. symbiosum and Nitrosopumilus maritimus, as well as the moderately thermophilic Nitrososphaera gargensis and the hyperthrmophilic Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii. The discovery that crenarchaeol in Ca. N. yellowstonii and N. gargensis disproved the previous consensus that crenarchaeol was specific to mesothermic Thaumarchaeota and suggests that it is found more broadly within the phylum. === Controversy === One metagenomic study of the depth-distribution of archaeal clades in the South Pacific Gyre has suggested that crenarchaeol is not exclusive to the Thaumarchaeota, but is also produced by the Marine Group II Euryarchaeota. However, no members of Marine Group II have thus far been cultivated and conflicting environmental data continues to support the hypothesis that crenarchaeol is exclusive to the Thaumarchaeota. == In biology == === Chemistry and function === Like other GDGTs, crenarchaeol is a membrane lipid with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The long, nonpolar hydrocarbon chains are hydrophobic while the ether-linked glycerol head groups are polar and hydrophilic. In most organisms, the cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer in which phospholipids arrange with their hydrophobic, nonpolar hydrocarbon tails facing inwards towards one another and their hydrophilic, polar head groups facing outwards to associate with the polar environments of the cytoplasm or cell exterior. This organization is promoted by the hydrophobic effect, which makes it energetically favorable for hydrophobic molecules to isolate themselves away from aqueous environments. Because GDGTs have two hydrophilic head groups, they form a lipid monolayer in the cell membrane instead of a bilayer, making GDGT-producing archaea exceptional among all clades of life. Originally, it was believed that GDGT membrane lipids were an adaption to life at high temperatures and acidities. Because the two sides of a monolayer lipid are connected by covalent bonds rather than the weaker intermolecular forces that promote the cohesion of bilayers, they are more stable than typical bilayers. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that some extremophile bacteria synthesize their own membrane-spanning, ether-bound GDGT analogues. The cyclic moieties of GDGTs may also be an adaption to hyperthermal conditions, and the number of rings in a GDGT's long hydrocarbon chains is temperature-dependent. Crenarchaeol has two cyclopentyl moieties on one of its hydrocarbon chains and one cyclohexyl and two cyclopentyl moieties on the other. However, the discovery that crenarchaeol and other GDGTs are produced by organisms living in mesothermal environments has thrown the hyperthermal-adaptation hypothesis into question. It has been proposed that the distinctive cyclohexyl moiety of crenarchaeol is an adaption to pelagic life, as it produces a \\"kink\\" in one of crenarchaeol's hydrocarbon chains that prevents the membrane lipids from packing tightly, as would be favorable under high temperatures but unfavorable under temperate ones. === Preservation and degradation in sediments === Crenarchaeol and other GDGTs can be preserved in the environment for hundreds of millions of years under the right conditions. Most GDGTs degrade at between 240 and 300 °C and so are not found in rocks that have undergone heating to temperatures higher than 300 °C. GDGTs undergo degradation when exposed to oxygen but the relative concentrations of sediment GDGTs tends to remain the same even during degradation, meaning that degradation does not interfere with proxies like TEX86 that are based on the ratios of different GDGTs. === Marine nitrogen cycle === Ammonia oxidation is important part of the nitrogen cycle, a biogeochemical cycle which cycles nitrogen through its various biological and mineral forms. AOA have been shown to dominate ammonia oxidation in the oceans and thus crenarchaeol, which is generally thought to be produced exclusively by AOA (specifically Thaumarchaeota), has been proposed as a specific biomarker for AOA and ammonia oxidation. Crenarchaeol abundance has been found to track with seasonal blooms of AOA, suggesting that it may be appropriate to use crenarchaeol abundances as a proxy for AOA populations and thus ammonia oxidation more broadly. However the discovery of Thaumarchaeota that are not obligate ammonia- oxidizers complicates this conclusion, as does one study that suggests that crenarchaeol may be produced by Marine Group II Euryarchaeota. === TEX86 paleothermometer === The number of rings in GDGT hydrocarbon chains is temperature dependent and provides the basis for the TEX86 paleothermometer, a proxy for measuring ancient sea surface temperature (SST) that relies on measurements of the abundances of crenarchaeol and its isomers. Crenarchaeol has a regioisomer which, based on radiocarbon analysis, may have a different origin than other isoprenoid GDGTs. Possible sources for the regioisomer include benthic archaea and diagensis of crenarchaeol, as the regioisomer is found in low abundance in surface waters and in cultures of pelagic thaumarchaea. Despite this, if it is excluded from TEX86 calculations, the paleothermometer's correlation with sea surface temperature becomes less apparent, indicating it is a necessary component of TEX86. == Isolation and measurement == GDGTs such as crenarchaeol can be analyzed using high- performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization- mass spectrometry (HPLC/APCI-MS) following extraction and acid hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis cleaves the polar head groups from the molecule, leaving the nonpolar chains behind. This is required for chromatography, which is not well suited to analysis of polar molecules. A variety of extraction techniques have been demonstrated to be effective for GDGTs. One common method is extraction by ultrasonication with methanol followed by washes of the nonpolar solvent dichloromethane (DCM). GDGTs have characteristic [M + H]+ \\\\- 18 and [M + H]+ \\\\- 74 ions that, for crenarchaeol, have masses of 1218 and 1162 Da, respectively. Relative abundances of GDGTs can be determined by integrating the peak areas of their characteristic ions. == References == Category:Lipids ","title":"Crenarchaeol"},{"id":"60421497","text":"Decolonization, also bacterial decolonization, is a medical intervention that attempts to rid a patient of an antimicrobial resistant pathogen, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or antifungal-resistant Candida.

This event caused a significant destabilisation of the currency and the Venezuelan economy. == Background == Luis Herrera Campins When Luis Herrera Campins became President in 1979, he called Venezuela a \\"mortgaged country\\". Viernes Negro in Venezuela was preceded by events such as the departure of Venezuela from the gold standard, the nationalisation of oil, and the beginning of a stage of decreasing public spending compared with State revenue. The situation worsened and was evident with the fall in oil prices that led to oil exports dropping from $19.3 billion in 1981 to around $13.5 billion in 1983 (a decrease of 30%), and the beginning of the Latin American debt crisis. These events produced a flight of capital of almost $8 billion and a corresponding decline in international reserves. President Herrera Campins also created different exchange rates for imports and exports, creating economic distress in national revenue and for transfer of goods, which contributed to the decline and ultimate devaluation. == Viernes Negro == The devaluation happened because of President Luis Herrera Campins' economic policies. Following the oil price crisis, the Herrera Campins government declared bankruptcy to the international banking community and then enacted currency restrictions. The policies centred on the establishment of an exchange-rate regime, imposing a restriction on the movement of currencies, and were strongly objected to by the then-president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, Leopoldo Díaz Bruzual. The currency controls devalued Venezuelan purchasing power by 75% in a matter of hours; banks did not open on Viernes Negro, and even the Central Bank did not have many reserves of foreign currencies, causing the government to devalue the bolívar by 100%. Controversy occurred when it was revealed that corporations were told of the restrictions in advance and began stockpiling US dollars. == Aftermath == Since then, Viernes Negro represents a milestone; the day that changed Venezuela's economic history. Before it, the bolívar had been characterised as stable and reliable since the 1910s, with its last free price against the dollar at a fixed value of 4.30:1. Since Viernes Negro, the economic situation of the nation has been tumultuous. The exchange stability of the Venezuelan currency disappeared because of constant devaluation of the bolívar, complications with the payment of external debt, the accelerated deterioration of purchasing power, and the implementation of an exchange control called \\"Regime of Differential Exchange\\" () — operating from 28 February 1983 to 10 February 1989, and marked by serious cases of corruption during the government of Jaime Lusinchi. == See also == * Viernes Rojo == References == Category:20th-century economic history Category:1983 in Venezuela Category:Economic history of Venezuela Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"Viernes Negro"},{"id":"60421516","text":"Pateville is an unincorporated community in Crisp County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== The community was named after J.

It was released on 22 March 2019 on CD, vinyl, digital download, and through streaming. It is the band's first studio album in over eight years. == Background == After the release of Spoons' previous album from 2011, Static in Transmission, Gordon Deppe noted that he felt it was to be the last Spoons album, but as life went on he realized he had more to say. The songs \\"Beautiful Trap\\" and \\"For the First and Last Time\\" were originally performed live as far back as 2015, but on 16 October 2017, the former was released as a free downloadable single on the Spoons' website. The album was recorded at bassist Sandy Horne and producer Jeff Carter's studio in Guelph: Sky Studios. This was the same studio used for Static in Transmission. Horne's daughter, Alexis, performs background vocals on one of the songs, and Deppe's son, Matthew, has his piano melodies featured on \\"Life on Demand\\" and \\"Landing Lights\\". An online contest was held for the album's first single, \\"All the Wrong Things (In The Right Places)\\", where fans could submit chants to be featured in the final mix of the song's chorus. The cover and the name of the album were influenced by one another. While finding ideas to use for the cover, the band came across a photographer online who had the picture available. The album was not necessarily going to be called New Day New World, but due to the subject matter and feelings evoked by the photograph, they found the name of the song to be fitting. On 9 June, one of three music videos were released for the album. \\"For the First and Last Time\\" features Deppe as a paranormal investigator in a seemingly-empty castle; little does he know the spirit (played by Horne) he is looking for is on his trail the entire time. Directed by former ghost-hunter Peter Sacco of the show the Paranormal Profilers, the first chapter of the three-part story was selected for eight international film festivals ranging from the Cannes Short Film Festival to the Jaipur International Film Festival. The video also was screened at the Indo Global Film Festival and Virgin Spring Cinefest, where it took home the award for best director and music video, respectively.

As the oldest and largest tenants' organization in the city,\\" it has focused on issues including rent regulation and affordable public housing. == Founding == The Met Council came together in 1959 as a coalition of twenty tenant councils. The initial founders of the Met Council included Jane Benedict, who had been involved with her neighborhood housing organization, Yorkville Save Our Homes Committee. In response to a need for low-cost, integrated public housing, the Committee organized in their own neighborhood and then merged with other neighborhood- based tenant organizations to form the Metropolitan Council on Housing. === Diversity in early leadership === The housing movement in New York City was noted in this era for the prevalence of women in leadership, including at the Met Council; in addition to Jane Benedict, other founders included Esther T. Rand and Frances Goldin, and other women in leadership roles early in the organization's existence included Mrs. Juan Sanchez and Marie Runyon. Leadership was also integrated at the Council's founding; Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality Director and later congressman Major Owens noted that he had learned much from his organizing work with Met Council. Founder Jane Benedict continued to work for forty years in various capacities with the Met Council; she fought for broader implementation of rent control and rent stabilization, and for the preservation of low income housing units. === Location === The initial headquarters of the Met Council were at 2050 2nd Avenue, New York. Council offices later moved to 339 Lafayette Street, also known as the Peace Pentagon. == Tenant Organizing Work == === 1950s === Early work by the newly- formed Met Council included a 1959 campaign to remove Robert Moses from his position with the Committee on Slum Clearance. They distributed 100,000 leaflets detailing Moses' failure to appropriately administer the Title 1 program. === 1960s === Work against slum clearance continued into the following decade and included publication of the 1964 report, A Citizen's Survey of Available Land, which detailed space in New York City available for the construction of low-rent housing without clearing existing housing. Met Council put pressure on the city to take ownership of abandoned buildings, rather than just knock them down. Throughout the 1960s, the Met Council lobbied to keep rent increases low on rent controlled units. This work included the publication of a 1961 report, The Harmful Effects of a Rent Increase, which detailed how increased rents could in fact increase vacancy rates as a result of increased cohabitation, while current rent controlled units provided landlords with a good return on their investment. This came in the face of lobbies from real estate interests for a 15 percent increase on the cost of rent controlled units. They continued to campaign in 1963 for more low-rent housing, instead of rent increases, as a solution to housing shortages in New York City. In 1968, they published The Case for Overall Rent Control. Work of the Met Council during this era was noted for its efforts to ensure low-cost housing for minority groups. === 1970s === Met Council's work in the 1970s also included support of squatter-led actions through Operation Move-In, which continued the Council's earlier work against slum clearance and in advocacy for rehabilitation of abandoned buildings. It then took part, alongside representatives from the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords, and I Wor Kuen, in hosting a Peoples' Court Housing Crimes Trial, which famously put the city on trial for the affordable housing crisis, with representatives from each organization presenting witness testimonials. This action was noted for its use of performative aspects of protest, and the way it successfully attracted media attention. This work on the Housing Crimes Trial showcased general improvements in the Metropolitan Council on Housing's use of media in its organizing work; the Council began to also hold workshops for tenant organizations on how to garner publicity and present their concerns in the media, and published Techniques and Devices to Get Your Press Release into Print. After Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller enacted a 1971 law that put rent regulation under state control and would remove apartments from rent control as tenants moved out of them, the Met Council issued a call for widespread rent strikes and hosted workshops for tenants on how they could organize rent strikes in their own buildings. Jane Benedict and the Met Council had fought this move, and its subsequent management of rent controlled units through a computer system that was designed to manage rent increases; they called instead for Federal rent control legislation that would have a national scope and broader tenant protections. In 1979, in the face of tenants losing apartments because of landlords who wished to enforce roommate occupancy violations, the Met Council spoke up about the need for rent laws to change along with changing living customs in New York City. === 1980s === Metropolitan Council on Housing joined with other local organizations, including New York Public Interest Group and the Sierra Club, in 1985 to form the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning, specifically to target lead poisoning but more broadly to tackle problems at the intersection of environmental issues and population health. In 1988, the organization's Co- Chairwoman, Susan Radosh, spoke up against Governor Mario Cuomo's proposal to combine rent controlled and rent stabilized apartments into a single regulation system. === 2010s === After four decades of work the Metropolitan Council on Housing needed to shift some of its campaigning in response to new issues in New York City's affordable rental landscape, including organizing against rezoning that would impact low cost housing availability. However, the Council's main focus has remained supporting tenant organizations. The Council is a partner in the Real Rent Reform Campaign. In 2016, Ava Farkas, Executive Director of the Met Council, spoke out against New York City's Mandatory Inclusionary Housing policies rolled out by Mayor Bill de Blasio, linking this policy to increases in gentrification in New York City. The Council currently provides advice to tenants on their legal rights through online resources, a telephone hotline, a walk-in clinic, and a free, bilingual newspaper,Tenant/Inquilino. It also provides data related to tenant practices and behavior in New York City. === 2020s === During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the Council joined a group called Housing Justice for All, which included various organizations and tenant organizers. The group called for an eviction moratorium in New York, and they helped train tenants who wanted to organize rent strikes. On March 20, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a 90-day moratorium on evictions. == Other Organizing Work == Early activism of the Metropolitan Council on Housing was noted for its intersectionality; in the 1960s it advocated for an end to the Vietnam War, and leadership was invited to testify at a 1970 state commission hearing on women's rights. == References == Category:Affordable housing advocacy organizations Category:Organizations based in New York City Category:Rent regulation Category:Regulation in the United States Category:Housing in New York (state) ","title":"Metropolitan Council on Housing"},{"id":"60422010","text":"Kiana Danial is the author of four books including Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies and Invest Diva's Guide to Making Money in Forex.

Green was educated in Friends' School, Lisburn. Alongside his brothers he took up an apprenticeship in his teens which involved him moving to Liverpool. Upon his return to Ireland, he moved to Belfast and set up a business trading tea and coffee to both the commercial and consumer markets. By the age of 24, Green had amassed a successful business, Forster Green and Company: tea and coffee merchants. Green's business operated from multiple premises around Belfast City Centre, including in High Street, Royal Avenue and Cornmarket. Green and his family resided in Derryvolgie house, a large house just off the Malone Road in South Belfast. In 1840, Green married Mary Boalde from Whitehaven. Together they had six children, five daughters and one son. Four of their daughters perished of consumption before reaching adulthood, their only surviving daughter Mary later married and had four children. The Green's son died of lung disease due to consumption in his mid- twenties whilst in Egypt trying to seek warmer climates more favourable to his condition. Mary Green died in 1880 and two years later Forster Green married his second wife Jane Holding. The experiences with respiratory illness profoundly shaped Forster Green's later philanthropic work. Green was an active member in the society of friends, this strong Christian faith along with his personal experiences with diseases such as tuberculosis lead him and his wife to donate £2,000 to Throne Hospital, Belfast- this was a hospital located in North Belfast, that at the time was a children's hospital- it closed in 1992. This donation was used to open a specialist unit in the hospital for the treatment of consumption. Green purchased Fortbreda House and the surrounding grounds for a total sum of £11,000 in 1895 with the plan to build a hospital specifically for the treatment of consumption and chest complaints. Green was aware of the challenges posed by the setting up and running of a hospital as he was a life governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. At the time one of the only treatments for tuberculosis was access to fresh air, this was one of the reasons why the Fortbreda site, with its location at the time being outside the city in relative countryside, was a perfect location for a consumption unit. Over the subsequent two years the site was developed and on 30 September 1897 Forster Green Hospital for Consumption and Chest Diseases opened. Upon the opening of the hospital Green was actively involved in its running through his role as President. Forster Green remained involved in the organisation of the hospital into his later years, he passed away in Belfast in 1903, at the age of 88. ==References== Category:1815 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Northern Ireland ","title":"Forster Green"},{"id":"60422456","text":"The African Security Congress (ASC) is a South African political party founded to lobby for the interests of private security guards, in particular for government to employ security guards directly.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the Episcopal Church (United States) wanted to increase mission outreach to isolated communities within the Commonwealth. At Phoebe Needles, the Episcopal church established a small mission church, St Peter's-on-the-Mountains, and a school. The school provided free education to rural and mountain areas where the students could not go to the public schools. The Rev. William T. Roberts organized both the Episcopal mission at Phoebe Needles, as well as St. John-of-the-Mountain in Endicott, Virginia. Latitude: 36.967359 Longitude: -80.095595 Geographic Name Information System GNIS ID: 1494484 ==Mission School== The school site was selected because at that time the state school system had no method of public transport. There was a need for a school in the area with few roads and little transport, and the school system could not afford to operate another school outside of the local one in Callaway, about four miles away. The school building was constructed in 1907 along with a small wooden church,Emmanuel Church. Commencing with the first semester, Miss Caryetta \\"Etta\\" Davis took charge of the school as the missionary-in-charge. She would serve for over 30 years at the school. Originally it had forty students, and quarters were also constructed for the teachers on site. In 1913, a terrible snow storm destroyed both the school and the church. A new facility was built between 1915 and 1917, that was built of stone from local quarries. This construction was almost entirely financed by Arthur C. Needles, who was at the time president of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, in honor of his daughter, Phoebe. Phoebe Needles had recently died at the age of six due to meningitis. The school provided for students in grades one through seven. Originally devised for mountain girls, it was later opened to both boys and girls.Salmon, John S. and Emily J. Salmon. 1993.

He appeared in the Football League for Brighton & Hove Albion and Scunthorpe & Lindsey United, and played for many years in Welsh amateur football. ==Life and career== Rees was born in 1924 in Neath, which was then in Glamorgan, the youngest of six children of James Francis- Rees and his wife, Gertrude née Snow. He attended Cwrt Sart Central School in Briton Ferry, and played football as a youngster for Garthmor and for Neath schoolboys. He played for Swansea Town in the wartime competitions, regularly in 1943–44 and occasionally the following season, before joining Briton Ferry Athletic, where he was instrumental in their Welsh League Division Two West title win in 1946–47. After a trial with Norwich City at the end of that season, he turned professional with the Third Division South club. According to the Western Mail, it was \\"a blow to [Briton Ferry] when he signed for Norwich, because it meant that they faced their first season in Division I of the Welsh League without the 'key' man who had taken them there.\\" After a season during which he never appeared for Norwich's first team and was reported to have failed to settle, Rees went home to Wales. He married Peggy Bell in the summer of 1948, and resumed his career with Briton Ferry Athletic. After he was recommended to Brighton & Hove Albion by former Welsh international player Les Jones and impressed in a trial, he returned to English football, albeit briefly. He made his Football League debut on 9 September 1949, in a 1–0 win away to Newport County, but played only once more for the League side before being released. He spent what was left of the season with Barry Town, for which he made 22 Southern League appearances. Rees spent the 1950–51 season back in the Football League, under the management of Les Jones at Scunthorpe & Lindsey United, newly elected to the Third Division North. He made 18 league appearances, mostly in the first half of the season, before returning to amateur football in Wales. Between 1952 and 1957, Rees played for Aberystwyth Town. He captained the team, played in 186 matches in which he scored 36 goals, and earned a reputation for the spectacular. A eulogistic piece on the club's website describes his 1953–54 goal of the season: \\"In a dazzling run from the half-way line he beat man after man, pulling out of his bag of tricks every sleight-of-foot in the soccer magician's handbook, before unleashing one of his specials.\\" He also played for Milford United and Port Talbot Town.

Tichy (1905–81) was a prolific 20th-century American architect and industrial designer. Tichy is perhaps best known for his association with the Pennsylvania Railroad, for which he created the infamous “Clamshell”, an aluminum and steel canopy over the electronic ticketing area, in Penn Station’s Main Waiting Room in New York City. Tichy's “Clamshell” is largely seen as a harbinger of the station's ultimate demolition, and stands for the lost landmark's final decline. ==Early Life== Born in 1905, Tichy studied at Columbia University in Upper Manhattan. After graduation, Tichy toured Europe and began working under John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Though Pope's firm was working on a number of notable Washington, D.C. structures at the time, Tichy ultimately opted to strike out on his own. Free of Pope's Beaux-Arts shackles, Tichy hung up his shingle as a distinctively modern architect. ==Career== left Dubbed a “[n]oted [a]rchitect” by 1956, Tichy ultimately left his mark on homes, railroad stations, dormitories, and even the paint schemes of Long Island Rail Road trains over the course of a long and varied career. Tichy was a protégé of Raymond Loewy, another venerable Pennsylvania Railroad designer. Like Loewy, Tichy proceeded to design a wide range of structures for the Pennsylvania across its sprawling system. At Aberdeen, Tichy designed a compact, streamlined station with Machine Age details. At Enola, Tichy created a dormitory that provided “neat,” “quiet,” and “comfortable” accommodations for Railroad men in need of a place to retire after long freight runs. Another Tichy dorm at Harrisburg offered “big, full-height, corrugated-glass” windows in keeping with the “progressive” tastes of the times. And between 1949 and 1955, Tichy designed modern paint schemes for the Long Island Rail Road, a Pennsylvania subsidiary. Tichy's modernist sensibilities were not confined to the “standard railroad of the world.”John A. Fostik, Amtrak Across America: An Illustrated History at p. 33. Throughout the middle of the 20th-century, Tichy designed flat-roofed structures that found critical acclaim in the publications of his time. In 1945, House & Garden recognized one of Tichy's telltale houses with a prize in its “Blueprints for Tomorrow” architectural contest. This newfound notoriety led to additional commissions, including a “streamlined metal and glass snack bar” for La Guardia Airport in 1948. With Tichy's status cemented, acclaim flowed. In 1956, a LIFE Magazine advertiser heralded Tichy's designs in a full-page spread. “Tichy has brought summer fun and freedom indoors,” the advertiser swooned. ==Penn Station and Tichy's “Clamshell”== right Though Tichy's imprint appeared on a range of modern structures, he became best identified with his 1956 “Clamshell” in Manhattan’s original Penn Station. right By 1952, Tichy remained associated with the Pennsylvania Railroad, although he had left its employ. The Pennsylvania, confronting mounting passenger losses, contracted with Tichy to replace Penn Station's grand Savarin dining room with a series of two bowling alleys in an attempt to raise cash off its cavernous – but cash-bleeding – Manhattan facility. Throughout 1952, Tichy partnered with the Pennsylvania to develop revenue-generating concessions at Penn Station and air-rights sales over its adjacent rail yards. Tichy's new partnership with the Pennsylvania was a harbinger of things to come. In 1954, Tichy himself “prepared plans for an orderly demolition” of the beloved station, and began associating with real estate titans William Zeckendorf and Benjamin Swig. With the scent of redevelopment in the air, Tichy then began designing an airline-style ticket counter to satiate the Pennsylvania's desire to boost ticket sales and make money off its station. “Whether desperately or cynically,” wrote The New York Times, railroad executives “seemed to understand that redevelopment of their money-losing, nine-acre station would be more palatable if the public could be made to forget the glories of Mr. McKim's original design.” The result was a “modernistic, clamshell-shaped, sawtooth-edged, fluorescent-bathed ticket counter” in the center of Penn Station's monumental – but, by then, soot- streaked and grimy – Main Waiting Room. Erected at a cost of $2 million, Tichy's “Clamshell” housed a new-fangled electronic ticket center that was “supposed to convince passengers that railroading was as modern as flying.” “The glowing fluorescent curve under the soiled classical space was like a jet plane next to a grimy locomotive,” wrote architectural historian Christopher Gray. Today, some remember Tichy's “Clamshell” as a “luminous,” “soaring,” and “swooping” example of mid-century modern design. But to others, such as historian and sociologist Lewis Mumford, the “Clamshell” was a “great treason” to Penn Station's design. Mumford speculated the Pennsylvania Railroad plopped Tichy's clamshell in the center of Penn Station's “otherwise uninterrupted grand axi[s]” to provide “justification” for “destroying the station from the inside.” The Railroad did ultimately demolish Penn Station in an “[e]pic [a]ct of [c]ivic [v]andalism,”https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly- standard/undoing-an-epic-act-of-civic-vandalism and many now agree Tichy's “Clamshell” was “a nail in the station's coffin” and “the final insult to McKim, Mead & White’s heroic 1910 station.” Tichy “brutally raped” the station, concluded architect B. Sumner Gruzen. ==Legacy== right Today, Tichy's “Clamshell” is remembered as the first shot in the Pennsylvania Railroad's battle to destroy its own flagship station. Yet the modernist played a far more integral role in Penn Station's destruction than commonly thought. Architectural Forum described Tichy's early demolition plans as “how to turn a monument into cash,” and heralded his three-stage scheme for “shrinking the glory to fatten the revenue.” After a series of starts and stops, the Pennsylvania Railroad did eventually refine and deploy Tichy's demolition and redevelopment concept to destroy the original Penn Station and construct Madison Square Garden on top.Peter Moore, The Destruction of Penn Station (2001) Thus, every time a railroad passenger “scuttles” into today's Penn Station “like a rat,” they have, in part, architect Lester C. Tichy to thank. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1981 deaths ","title":"Lester C.

By this time its competitor had been awarded a serial production order, so only one Bene was completed. ==Design and development== In 1948 the Hungarian National Flying Association (OMRE), which in 1951 became the Hungarian Aeronautical Association (MRSz), invited tenders for a two seat primary glider; the runner-up was a design from Hugó Nagy and Tibor Bánsági. In 1950 they submitted a revised version, named Bene after Lajos Benicky the designer of the MSrE M-30 Fergeteg. The Bene had an all-wood, two part high wing, ball-jointed together on a short pedestal above the fuselage. In plan there was a rectangular inner section, occupying about a third of the span, and trapezoidal, round-tipped outer panels with most of the taper on the trailing edge. Each half-wing were built around a straight main spar at about 33% chord and an auxiliary spar at 70% chord. All wing surfaces were plywood covered. The wings were braced with a single strut on each side, joining the lower fuselage to the main spar towards the end of the inner panel. The inner panels carried inboard landing flaps and beyond them, Göppingen-type spoilers, mounted just ahead of the spar, which opened above and below the wings. Its split, differential, Frise-balanced ailerons filled all of the trailing edges of the outer panels. Unusually, another set of spoilers, mounted near the wingtips just aft of the auxiliary spar and opening only upwards, assisted turns. The fuselage was of mixed construction. The forward section, from the rear of the wing to the nose and including the pedestal, was built around a square cross-section, welded steel-tube girder with transverse frames shaping the curved fabric surface. Aft, it was a wooden structure. The pupil sat ahead of the wing, with the instructor under it at about 25% chord. His seat was higher than that of the pupil so he could see the single set of instruments and placed his head in a small gap between the half-wings forward of the main spar, giving him some upward vision as the one-piece canopy stretched back above the wing to the spar. The Bene did not land on a conventional glider landing skid but instead had a small nosewheel, a larger main wheel at the c.g. under the trailing edge and a small tailskid. Winch launches were made with a Y-ended cable that engaged a hook on each side of the nose. The Bene's unswept, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a strut on each side. Its elevators were strongly tapered and cut away centrally for rudder movement. The fin was also unswept and round- tipped, carrying a broad, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel. After its maiden flight in mid 1952 the Bene received only limited testing, as the competing MRSz Z-03 Ifjúság had already received an order for serial production. The sole example was scrapped in 1954. ==Specifications == ==References== Category:Aircraft first flown in 1952 Category:1950s Hungarian sailplanes ","title":"MRSz Bene"},{"id":"60422849","text":"Infatuation is a 1918 French silent film directed by René Hervil and Louis Mercanton.

K.) 36 is a prototype German 9mm submachine gun developed by Hugo Schmeisser. ==Overview== The M.K. 36 represents one of the early attempts to build a submachine gun for widespread issue to infantry troops. M.K. 36s feature a full-length rifle-style furniture, provisions to mount the standard S84/98 bayonet, and tangent leaf sights that go out to 1 km. They have considerably longer barrels than most contemporary submachine guns in an attempt to increase the effective range by boosting muzzle velocity. The M.K. 36 operates on the blowback operating system and fires from the open bolt. It has a fire selector that allows the operator to choose between semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. The fire selector and control mechanisms were largely derived from the earlier MP 28, II. Oddly, the M.K. 36 features a bolt safety, the bolt cannot be cocked without a magazine inserted. There is photographic evidence of three variants of the M.K. 36: the M.K. 36, III, the M.K. 36, II, and the M.K. 36, II made for Hungarian trials. The variants differ in the type of rifle furniture they mount, bayonet lug configuration, caliber, and the position of the charging handle. The original M.K. 36, II is chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum, has a left-side charging handle and a standard German bayonet mount and markings behind the rear right sight. The Hungarian trials M.K. 36, II is chambered in 9×25mm Mauser and features a stacking rod, different bayonet mount meant for Hungarian M35 bayonet, and a right-side charging handle. It is marked in front of the ejection port. The M.K. 36, III returns to 9x19mm, has the standard German bayonet mount, and a right-side charging handle. It is marked in front of the ejection port. ==Bolt Design== The design of the recoil spring and bolt was the most controversial and influential aspect of the M.K. 36, III. The design consisted pf a series of nested cylinders with the recoil spring inside, with the firing pin affixed to the front of the end cylinder. Another cylinder with the bolt head and charging handle was placed on top of the recoil-spring assembly. This design is almost identical to the design used in the MP38 and MP40 submachine guns that saw widespread use. However, the competing EMP36 submachine gun by Erma Werke used a similar bolt structure that also involved a telescoping spring. Heinrich Vollmer, a competing designer who designed the EMP36 held the patent for telescoping springs of the type, so production of the M.K. 36, III was halted due to patent infringement. Despite the Vollmer's patent, the bolt design on the MP38 resembles the M.K. 36 III far more than the EMP36. ==References== ==External Links== historicalfirearms.info mp40.nl Category:9mm Parabellum submachine guns Category:World War II infantry weapons of Germany Category:Submachine guns of Germany Category:World War II submachine guns ","title":"Maschinenkarabiner 36"},{"id":"60422902","text":"Kadiam Mandal is one of the 64 mandals in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh.

Cain fatally shot Santos Rodriguez, a 12-year-old Mexican- American child. Officer Cain and Officer Roy R. Arnold were investigating reports of a burglary at a Fina gas station when they took Santos Rodriguez and his 13-year-old brother David Rodriguez from their home for an impromptu interrogation over the burglary. Cain shot Santos Rodriguez while conducting Russian roulette on the brothers in an attempt to force a confession from them. Cain was found guilty of murder with malice, and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released on September 11, 1979, after serving the minimum two-and-a-half-year sentence. == Parties involved == === Santos Rodriguez === Santos Rodriguez, 1960-1973 Santos Rodriguez was born on November 7, 1960, and was the child of Bessie Garcia and David Rodriguez.Death Certificate, Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics. Santos Rodriguez, 51805. July 24, 1973. Rec'd August 10, 1973. He was reported to have been tall. At the time of his death, Santos and his brother lived with an adoptive grandfather, 84-year-old Carlos Minez, in the Little Mexico neighborhood of Dallas. Their mother, Bessie, was serving a five-year sentence in the Goree women's unit of Huntsville State Prison. She had been convicted for the April 1971 killing of 62-year-old Leonard Brown, her boyfriend. Santos and his brother, David, were placed in the home of Minez, who had helped care for Bessie during her childhood, at their mother's request after her conviction. The three youngest Rodriguez siblings, Ruben, Robert, and Juanita, were placed in foster homes. Santos was a student at William B. Travis Elementary School. Santos and his brother, David, had previous run-ins with the law over shoplifting and truancy, and Santos was described by his teachers as naive and easily influenced, deep thinking, gentle and a fan of classical music. Teachers would also report to The Dallas Morning News that they \\"kept feeling all along that something was going to happen to those boys\\". Supervisors at the Pike Park Community Center where Santos played described him as someone who was willing to volunteer to help clean the park and community center. Santos played soccer at Pike Park, and friends described how he played as a starter and could kick a soccer ball halfway down a field. His mother reported that he enjoyed listening to the band Santana, and loved eating enchiladas and hotdogs. === David Rodriguez === David Rodriguez was Santos' older brother. He was also a student at William B. Travis Elementary at the time of Santos' death. David was in the police car with his brother when Santos was shot, and witnessed his death. David currently lives in Dallas, Texas. === Darrell L. Cain === Darrell Lee Cain, 30, was a five-year veteran of the Dallas Police Department (DPD) at the time of Santos' death. He was born in Benkelman, Nebraska, on March 31, 1943. He died on March 17, 2019. He was married in 1964, and had one son at the time of the murder. He served in the Army from 1962 to 1965, and was honorably discharged with the rank of Spec 4. At the time of the murder, Cain had been reportedly attending college part time. Cain had been previously involved in the controversial death of 18-year-old Michael MoreheadDeath Certificate, Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics. Michael Morehead, 25089. April 20, 1970. Rec'd May 14, 1970. (also spelled Michael Moorhead) on April 20, 1970. At around 3:10 a.m. Cain and another officer, Jeffery L. Kirksey, were investigating a silent burglar alarm that had been set off at the Empire Bar & Grill at 3307 Munger Ave. They found Morehead and a relative burgling the restaurant. Morehead and his 26-year-old relative fled the scene, but Morehead was shot three times as he fled, leading to his death. In total, Cain had fired five shots and Kirksey fired eight. Morehead's grandmother produced recorded statements from witnesses claiming that Morehead had been shot while he was on the ground, and that he had begged the officers not to shoot him. While witnesses to the shooting later changed their statements following questioning by the FBI, investigations of the shooting revealed that the officers had shot into the grassy field where Morehead lay. No charges were ever brought against Cain or Kirksey, but they were moved to another patrol area in part due to public pressure and protests. Michael Morehead was the son of George Morehead and Carrie Young, and was buried in Glen Oak Memorial Cemetery in Dallas. Later that year, Cain shot and wounded a man in a Dallas city park. === Roy R. Arnold === Roy Arnold, 23, was a three-year veteran of the DPD at the time of Santos' death. His father was police sergeant Horace \\"Hap\\" Arnold. Arnold was not charged in the Santos Rodriguez murder case. On August 3, 1973, he was dismissed from the DPD for failure to file a full report of the night of the shooting. A resident of the neighborhood where the murder occurred reported to the DPD on August 2, 1973, that they had heard a gunshot from the area before the shooting of Santos. Further investigation revealed that Cain and Arnold had witnessed two youths breaking and entering the Fina gas station and that Arnold had fired one shot towards the suspects in an attempt to warn them from fleeing. The suspects escaped, and Arnold failed to report firing a warning shot. Questions arose during the murder investigation regarding whether or not Arnold had enough time to intervene in the Russian roulette interrogation held by Cain, or whether Arnold could have acted to prevent Santos' death. == Background == Santos Rodriguez lived in the Little Mexico neighborhood, a historically Mexican-American neighborhood that was built in part due to immigration patterns and segregation practices in Dallas. By the 1950s, Mexican-American and students of Hispanic and Latino origin could attend one of four segregated elementary schools: William B. Travis, Cumberland Hills, Benito Juarez, and City Park. Crozier Tech High School served as the segregated high school for the Mexican-American communities of Dallas. By 1970, Mexican Americans made up around 8% of the city's population, or around 40,000 people. While early Mexican-American organizations tried to assimilate into Anglo Dallas society, Mexican-American students still faced segregated schools that lacked resources compared to Anglo schools, as well as structural racism. The first Mexican-American City Council member, Anita Martinez, was elected in 1969, and at the time of the murder Pedro Aguirre served on the City Council. This time period was also marked by the rise of the Chicano movement, which had begun its development in the mid 1960s with the grape strikes of California and developed into a national civil rights movement. == Murder == Police records noted a burglary call on Tuesday, July 24, 1973, at 2:10 am at a Fina gas station located at 2301 Cedar Springs in Dallas. There are conflicting reports on how and when Cain and Arnold arrived at the scene of the burglary. An article from the Dallas Times Herald stated that Cain and Arnold reported to the Fina gas station after receiving information from police dispatch that there was a robbery in progress, and that the suspect(s) had fled by the time police arrived. In contrast, Arnold was dismissed from the Police force in August 1973 for failing to report firing a warning shot at a suspect fleeing the gas station, indicating that the officers arrived at the robbery and witnessed the suspects as they fled or that Arnold fired upon a civilian in the area. According to The Dallas Morning News, Arnold reported that he believed the suspects were David and Santos Rodriguez. Cain and Arnold went to the home where the Rodriguez brothers were living and took them into custody at around 2:30 am. There was no warrant issued, but the officers claimed they had received permission from their guardian, Carlos Minez. Minez reportedly spoke rudimentary English,Hernandez, Osmin R. (2016). !Justicia for santos!: Mexican american civil rights and the santos rodríguez affair in dallas, texas, 1969–1978 (Order No. 10113202). p. 78 Ethnic NewsWatch; ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (1802267809). and there is no record that either officer spoke Spanish. David and Santos were handcuffed and put into Arnold's police car without being given time to change their clothes or put on shoes, and were taken to the gas station for an impromptu interrogation. The vehicle was parked in a vacant lot behind the gas station with Arnold in the driver's seat, Cain in the seat behind Arnold, Santos in the passenger seat, and David seated behind him. Arnold questioned the boys about the burglary, but neither would confess to committing the crime. Much of the questioning was towards Santos. Cain later testified that after the boys denied criminal involvement he told Arnold that he would make the boys talk, and Cain took his .357 Magnum revolver and removed the bullets in a way that the removed bullets would make a noise as they hit together. Cain claimed he visually checked the cylinder and did not see any bullets left in his gun. Cain took his gun and aimed it at Santos, warning the boy to tell him the truth about the burglary. Santos refused to confess guilt, and Cain pulled the trigger, clicking an empty chamber. Cain again threatened to shoot Santos if he did not confess, and according to later testimony by Cain, Santos' last words were \\"I am telling the truth.\\" Cain pulled the trigger again at Santos, and this time the gun fired. The bullet struck below Santos' left ear, penetrating his brain and causing his death instantly. Cain and Arnold quickly exited the car, leaving David, who was still handcuffed and unable to exit the vehicle, alone with Santos' body. David told his brother “You are going to be all right” as blood began to seep onto David's feet. David would be left in the vehicle with his brother for around 10 minutes, still handcuffed. DPD Officer Jerry Foster was also at the scene at the time of Santos' killing. Foster was on patrol when he responded to a police broadcast reporting the burglary at the gas station. He investigated the scene and found that a desk drawer was open in the station, a rear window was broken out, and a cigarette machine had been pried open. Foster witnessed the arrival of Cain, Arnold, and the Rodriguez brothers in Arnold's car. Foster reported that he yelled out to Arnold that he had received information that a third individual was suspected in the burglary. Foster approached Arnold's car and laid his arm on the car door when he heard the shooting of Santos. Foster saw Santos' head slump over and saw blood coming from Santos' head. Foster heard Cain scream before Cain quickly exited the vehicle and stated: \\"\\"My God, My God, What have I done, I didn't mean to do it.\\" Arnold also left the vehicle and vomited. Moments after Cain exited the vehicle, Foster took Cain's gun from him. Five live rounds and one empty cartridge were in the gun. Officer David Rowe, who was also on patrol that morning, responded to a radio call about a boy being accidentally shot. Rowe arrived at the scene minutes after hearing the radio call, and saw that both Rodriguez brothers were still handcuffed and in the police car, with Santos in the front seat \\"all bloody\\". Officer Rowe would later attend Santos' funeral. Santos' pulse was checked and an ambulance was called. Santos was pronounced dead on arrival at Parkland Hospital. == Aftermath and responses == Carlos Minez, Santos' and David's foster grandfather, was notified by the DPD of Santos' death by being asked to identify a body. Within hours of the shooting, Cain was suspended from the police force. DPD Chief Frank Dyson filed charges of murder with malice against Cain the same morning of the shooting. A bond of $5,000.00 was set by Municipal Court Judge Frances Goodwin for Cain, and Cain was released Tuesday afternoon after his attorney Phil Burleson posted his bond. Dyson expressed his disappointment at the bond price, and Goodwin later refused to comment on her bond setting when pressed by the Mexican-American community. By July 26, two days after the shooting, the investigation of the Cedar Springs burglary proved that neither of the brother's fingerprints matched any at the scene of the crime. On Tuesday activist Rene Martinez helped organize a community meeting at Pike Park in order to coordinate a protest for Saturday, July 28. Speakers at the Pike Park meeting and attendees, who included leaders such as Pancho Medrano, spoke out against both the shooting and the low bail set for Cain. On Wednesday, July 25, a funeral announcement was listed for Santos in The Dallas Morning News. The announcement listed his surviving relatives and details of his funeral: the service would be held on Thursday, July 26, at 2:00 pm at the First Mexican Baptist Church, and would be officiated by Reverend Rudy Sanchez. Bessie Rodriguez arrived in Dallas on Wednesday on a three-day reprieve from her prison sentence to attend her son's funeral. On Wednesday night she attended a memorial service at Temple Emanu-El Methodist Church. District Attorney Henry Wade announced that same Wednesday that murder charges against Cain would be taken to the Dallas County grand jury once the DPD completed their investigation. Wade met with Minez and Sanchez and explained the procedure and legal steps in a murder case to the men, and in turn Wade felt that the community wanted him and his top assistant Doug Mulder to handle the case as they had previously handled the kidnapping case of Amanda M. Dealey, the daughter-in-law of Dallas Morning News president Joe M. Dealey. Over 600 people attended Santos' funeral on Thursday. Attendees included former councilwoman Anita Martinez and Al Lipscomb, who criticized the absence of Chief Frank Dyson. In his defense, Dyson claimed that he was told by Sanchez that police officers should not be in attendance, and contemporary accounts note that fellow officers expressed anger over the shooting of Santos. Santos laid in a silver casket. Sanchez led the service and noted that Minez had been a founder of the First Mexican-American Baptist Church, and that Santos and David had converted to Christianity a few months before Santos' death. Sanchez called for forgiveness and justice, and for the community to do more for children like the Rodriguez brothers. Six pallbearers, friends of Santos, carried Santos' casket to a hearse outside of the church. Around 200 mourners followed the funeral procession to Oakland Cemetery, where a short burial service was held. Santos' headstone lists his name, dates of birth and death, and the words \\"From his mother\\". Upon the recommendation of District Attorney Wade, Justice of the Peace Tom Naylor raised Cain's bond to $50,000.00 on Thursday, July 27, and issued a warrant for Cain's arrest. Naylor reported to The Dallas Morning News that he felt the higher bond was more appropriate. On that same day Wade and his assistant Doug Mulder presented murder charges against Cain to the grand jury. Several members of the DPD were in the grand jury room during the proceedings, including Roy Arnold, the director of the Dallas Police internal affairs division R. O. Dixon, and Lieutenant T. L. Baker of the crimes against persons division. At this time DPD internal affairs was continuing their investigation of Arnold. Wade met with David and Bessie Rodriguez and two other women on the day of the grand jury hearing, and while he made no official commentary on that meeting, Wade did assure news outlets that affidavits had been presented to the grand jury. Cain surrendered himself at the Dallas County jail that same evening, at around 7:30 pm. During this time a City Council committee temporarily removed the bond-setting powers of municipal court judges in felony cases that involve city employees as a response to the original $5,000.00 bond set for Cain. The three member committee was headed by Mayor Pro Tem George Allen, and had been advised by City Attorney Alex Bickley that a bond was not a punishment for a defendant but rather was a means of ensuring their appearance in court. Nevertheless, the committee saw the low bond as concerning and too low for the seriousness of the case, with the exception of committee member City Councilman Russell Smith. Rudy Sanchez established a committee of Mexican-American leaders in response to the shooting, and the committee created a list of demands regarding Santos' killing and community concerns regarding mistreatment of minority groups by the DPD. The committee had a closed meeting with Dyson at the Dallas Public Library on July 26, and afterwards made their demands before a panel of city councilmen and city officials. Their demands included an investigation into why Cain was given a low bond, how and why the DPD gave confidential juvenile files to the media, and investigation into every stage of Santos' and David's arrest. Councilman Pedro Aguirre called for more information about Arnold's actions during the shooting, and Councilman Garry Weber assured the Mexican-American community that they had the full support of the City Council. A meeting between the Mexican-American committee and city officials was set for Saturday, July 28, at 9:00 am by city manager George Schrader. On Friday, July 27, Cain was indicted by the grand jury and charged that he \\"did voluntarily and with malice aforethought kill\\" Santos. The case was set to appear before District Judge Ed Gossett. By the time of the indictment, the Mercantile National Bank established a Santos Rodriguez fund in order to pay for funeral expenses and future expenses of the Rodriguez siblings, and representatives from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Brown Berets held a joint meeting demanding that Arnold also be charged in the shooting. Attending the Saturday meeting with Dyson and City Manager Schrader were Rudy Sanchez, Rene Martinez of the Tri- Ethnic committee, Dallas attorney Florentino Ramirez, West Dallas worker Pete Martinez, and members of the Brown Berets, representing the Mexican-American community. City Council members Pedro Aguirre, Garry Weber, Russell Smith, and Adlene Harrison represented the City of Dallas at the meeting. Dyson acknowledged that there were DPD officers who exhibited racial bias when performing their duties, biases he termed \\"dual standards\\", and promised to do whatever possible to eliminate them. He did not respond to questions regarding the case against Cain, citing concerns over jeopardizing future criminal proceedings against Cain. Dyson claimed that new policies were being enacted to address racial biases in police officers, including giving psychological tests to determine the attitudes of officers accused of racial discrimination. He also noted that while it was up to the officer's discretion to handcuff suspects, it was not within protocol to take suspects to the scene of a crime. He also reaffirmed that the police records of the Rodriguez brothers should not have been given out to the press. Schrader told the committee that \\"what occurred on that morning was wrong in every sense.\\" == March == A march, held on July 28 and called the \\"March of Justice for Santos Rodriguez\\", was led by community leaders and organizations, including Rev. Sanchez, Councilman Pete Aguirre, Florentino Ramirez, State Representative Sam Hudson, and members of the Brown Berets. Marchers were predominantly of Mexican-American and African- American descent. The organization of the march, according to City Councilman George Allen, had the full backing of the city. The march began at Kennedy Plaza at around 12:00 pm, and led through Main Street to Dallas City Hall which was then located at 106 S. Harwood St. Speeches were made at the steps of City Hall calling for community unity and action, and at around 12:50 pm the march led back to Kennedy Plaza. Prayers were held at the plaza and the original organized march was dispersed. Afterwards, groups broke off from the march and latecomers joined the groups as they headed back towards City Hall. The crowd became agitated, and stores such as Neiman-Marcus, Titche's, Zales, Woolf Brothers, Jas. K. Wilson, Everts Jewelers, and H. L. Green's reported damages to storefronts and looting. At City Hall, leaders of the original march such as Councilman Aguirre and Representative Hudson got on top of a Dallas Police car and used the speaker system in an attempt to get the crowd under control. Dallas Police vehicles were damaged by the crowd, and a motorcycle was burned. Police officers experienced some physical attacks, with five officers injured, but there were no serious injuries. Officers in gas masks and armed with clubs confronted the crowd, and the crowd dispersed as some of its members damaged nearby stores. Leaders of the march later expressed dismay over the chaotic situation, but applauded the purpose of the march and its original organization. The Monday after the march, the Mexican- American committee led by Rev. Sanchez met with the city council to discuss the case and methods of confronting the treatment of minority groups by police. A special committee composed of eleven members was formed by the Greater Dallas Community Relations Committee in order to continue investigation and questioning of the events and circumstances surrounding Santos' shooting. The Rodriguez family later issued a statement regarding the march: > The Rodriguez family would only ask that when the people of Dallas hear the > name Santos Rodriguez they think not of the unwanted violence that became > associated with his name Saturday; but they think of the real Santos > Rodriguez, a gentle and well-liked 12-year-old boy who had his life > tragically taken from him. == Trial == On Thursday, October 11, 1973, a hearing was held in the Criminal Court No. 5 for a venue change for Cain's trial. District Attorney Mulder and Cain's attorney Phil Burleson asked for the trial to be moved outside of Dallas County out of concerns that it would be difficult to hold a fair trial in Dallas and surrounding counties due to the publicity of the shooting. Judge Ed Gossett considered moving the case to either Wichita Falls or Austin. Mulder objected to Wichita Falls due to the recent disbarment of the city's District Attorney, and Burleson objected to Travis County due to Austin receiving Dallas news stations and newspapers. Judge Gossett ultimately moved the trial to the 147th District Court of Austin, with the hearing set for November 12, 1973. Judge Gossett stayed on as presiding judge in the case in Austin. He also set a lower bond of $20,000.00 for Cain, which Cain paid on Friday, October 12, and was released. Until that point Cain was still in jail for the shooting. When asked about why he gave Cain a lower bond, Gossett responded that the bond was not a punishment, but rather served to ensure that a prisoner would appear in court. Attorneys for Cain filed 26 pre-trial motions, and included a motion for quashing Cain's indictment due to insufficient evidence, claims that the evidence presented to the grand jury was hearsay, quashing the indictment due to vagueness, requests for criminal records of the victims, recordings of police radio transmissions, requests for statements to police, and other motions typical for a trial. By November 2, Judge Gossett denied the motions to quash the indictments against Cain. At a seminar for trial techniques for defense attorneys held in Fort Worth, Burleson announced that the defense for Cain planned on taking the position that the shooting was accidental, and that Burleson would place Cain on the witness stand to give his view of the event. Cain was represented by Phil Burleson and Michael P. Gibson. The State of Texas was represented by DA Henry Wade, W. T. Westmoreland, Jr., Assistant DAs Doug Mulder and Jon Sparling, DA Robert O. Smith, Assistant DA Herman C. Gotcher, State's Attorney Jim D. Vollers, and State's Attorney David S. McAngus. A jury was chosen for the trial on Monday, November 12. The jury was composed of seven men and five women, and did not have any jurors who were Mexican-American or African- American. During the questioning portion of jury selection, Sparling explained that Texas law recognized two types of murder: murder with malice and murder without malice, and that malice could be formed moments before a murder is committed. In response, Burleson claimed that the events before the shooting would prove that the shooting was an accident. Motion hearings were also held that Monday. Burleson had presented a motion for continuance in choosing jurors, citing concerns over potential jurors becoming influenced by a small contingent of protesters outside of the courthouse, but Judge Gossett denied the motion. Judge Gossett ruled that the criminal histories and reputations of Santos, David, and Bessie Rodriguez were inadmissible in court and that witness descriptions of the shooting were admissible. In response to demonstrators who had gathered at the courthouse (numbering between two and ten), Travis County Sheriff Raymond Frank assigned fifteen to twenty deputies around the courtroom. On Tuesday, November 13, the prosecution brought five witnesses to the stand: David Rodriguez, patrolman Jerry W. Foster, ballistics expert Allan Jones, Officer Fred M. Jenkins, and Associate Medical Examiner Vincent DiMaio. David was the first witness to give his testimony of the day of the murder. At the beginning of his testimony, David detailed how he and Santos spent the evening of July 23 playing football. David claimed that he arrived home and went to bed around 10:00 pm, hearing Santos arrive around 15 minutes afterwards. David fell asleep and awoke to Officers Cain and Arnold taking the boys from their bed and putting them under arrest. David and Santos were handcuffed, and David sat in the back seat next to Cain while Santos was placed in the front seat with Arnold. Prior to the shooting, David saw another police car with two officers arriving at the scene. David and Santos were interrogated, and Santos claimed that they were innocent. David saw Cain pull out his gun, hold it in his lap, open and twirl the cylinder before closing it, and point the gun at Santos. The first time Cain pulled the trigger it made a clicking sound. According to David, Cain told Santos that the gun had a bullet in it this time, and that Santos had better tell Arnold the truth. Santos again claimed his innocence, and the second time Cain pulled the trigger Santos was shot and killed. After Santos was shot, David said he watched Cain out of fear that Cain would shoot him next, and that he did not see Cain touch the cylinder of the gun before Cain left the car. On cross examination, Burleson asked if Cain had emptied the bullets from his gun, and David responded that Cain did not. David previously had stated that officers left him in the car with Santos' body for around 10 minutes. Patrolman Jerry Foster was the second witness. Foster corroborated David's statement about two other officers arriving at the scene before the shooting: Foster stated that he and his partner Thomas McKee were the officers David saw that morning. Foster also stated that he was at the driver's door of the car where David and Santos were sitting when he heard a gunshot and saw the front of the vehicle light up. He then stated that he saw Santos' head fall back, and saw bleeding coming from the left side of Santos' head. He went over to the side of the car where Santos was to try to help him, and saw Cain getting out of the car. Foster went to Cain and took Cain's pistol from him, and did not see Cain touch the cylinder of the gun after leaving the vehicle. When Foster unloaded Cain's gun, he saw five live rounds and one hull in the cylinder. Foster also saw Arnold leave the vehicle and vomit. On cross examination, Foster elaborated that, after leaving the vehicle, Cain repeatedly said \\"My God, what have I done. I didn't mean to do it...Jerry [Foster], I didn't mean to do it.\\" In Foster's opinion, Cain seemed to be in shock. The third witness was ballistics expert Allan Jones. Jones testified that Santos had been shot from a distance of about six inches. Jones had examined the bullets and saw that none of them had been struck by a firing pin. According to Jones, the .357 Magnum pistol was designed to fire only when the trigger was fully pulled back, but could be made to make a clicking noise using two different methods. The fourth witness was Officer Fred M. Jenkins, who investigated the scene of the burglary and took several hand and finger prints from the machine that had been broken into. The prints were compared by four different officers to the prints of Santos, David, and a cousin of theirs who had also become a suspect, and nothing was found to associate David or Santos to the scene of the crime. The fifth and final witness was Dr. Vincent DiMaio, who conducted Santos' autopsy. Dr. DiMaio confirmed that Santos was killed by a gunshot wound to his head and brain, and that he had removed the bullet from Santos and given it to Jones, who examined the bullet and confirmed that it came from Cain's gun. After the testimonies of the five witnesses, the state rested its case. On Wednesday, November 14, Darrell Cain gave his testimony in his own defense. Cain claimed that he and Arnold found the Rodriguez brothers in their bed, and that they looked sweaty. Arnold told Cain that the brothers were the ones he saw running from the gas station. Cain and Arnold put the boys in handcuffs behind their backs and took them to a parking lot behind the burglarized gas station. Cain recalled that he and Arnold met officers Foster and McKee and that Arnold claimed there may have been a third burglar. According to Cain, when Arnold asked Santos if the boys had another brother, Santos affirmed that they did but that he did not know where his other brother was. Cain told Arnold that he would \\"make him [Santos] tell the truth\\", and took his pistol between his legs, emptied it, and visually checked that there were no bullets in the gun before closing the gun's chamber. Cain then pointed the gun at Santos and pulled the trigger, making a clicking sound. He warned Santos to tell the truth, and that there was a bullet in the gun. The second time Cain pulled the trigger, a shot fired, killing Santos. Cain described how he grabbed the bullets from his lap, jumped from the car, and put the bullets back into the gun while he was out of the vehicle. Cain said he was in shock and hysterical, and that he cried over what had happened. Mulder cross- examined Cain and asked if it was within normal police procedure to interrogate a young boy using a gun. Cain responded that it was not. Mulder asked Cain what made him set himself up as a judge of truth, and Cain responded that he did not know. Mulder had Cain reenact the incident in front of the jury. In response to Cain's previous claims that he had pressed his gun's ejector rod to empty it of bullets, Mulder demonstrated that the bullets would fall out of the gun if it were merely tilted. Mulder loaded and unloaded the gun by turning the cylinder upside down several times. Mulder questioned Cain about his claim that he reloaded the pistol, stating that Foster claimed he did not see Cain reload his gun outside of the car. Cain responded that he did indeed reload his gun, but that in the confusion nobody saw him. Mulder asked Cain what Santos' last words were, and Cain responded that they were \\"I am telling the truth.\\" Roy Arnold was called as a witness to the defense. Arnold claimed that the Rodriguez brothers were the boys he saw fleeing the gas station, and that while he did not witness Cain removing the bullets from his gun, he did hear noises that could have been bullets falling from a chamber, but that he did not truly know. He also claimed that he saw the hammer of the gun fall the first time Cain made the pistol make a clicking noise, but did not see if Cain pulled the trigger during the first round. During cross examination, Arnold claimed that he saw Santos fleeing the gas station and was wearing dark pants and a T-shirt. Arnold admitted that Santos was wearing light green pants when he was killed, and when Arnold was asked by Mulder how he reconciled the fact that Santos was dressed differently than Arnold claimed, Arnold admitted that he could not. The final defense witness was Travis County Deputy Sheriff Tommy Tucker. Tucker demonstrated how, if the ejector rod was used to empty the gun, two bullets could be caught in the chamber. Mulder responded, \\"Where did they find you?\\" and again demonstrated that the bullets would freely fall out of the chamber if the gun was tilted up. One testimony was disallowed from the trial. Dallas Psychiatrist Dr. John Holbrook testified to the judge without the presence of the jury that he had given Cain a truth serum, sodium amytal, two days after the shooting while Cain was given a lie detector test by trained polygrapher Ray Jones. According to Holbrook, Cain testified under the influence of this drug that he believed the gun was empty when he pointed it at Santos. Holbrook qualified his testimony by stating that the \\"truth serum\\" influenced Cain to tell the truth as Cain knew it to be. Judge Gossett stated that prior appellate court decisions barred the use of lie detector tests as court evidence, and that testimony given while under the influence of \\"truth serums\\" fell under the same category. Gossett also barred the media from reporting on the use of a \\"truth serum\\" during the time the case was before a jury. Final arguments were held on Thursday, November 15. DA Jon Sparling opened the final arguments, and described Arnold and Cain as \\"storm troopers\\" who broke into the Rodriguez home and arrested them without a warrant. Sparling stated that the evidence was overwhelming: Cain was guilty of murder. Sparling told the jury that the state's position was that Cain shot Santos deliberately and intentionally. He also reminded the jury that the law did not require the state to give a motivation for the shooting. The bulk of Sparling's argument was focused on Cain's claim that he believed he emptied the gun. Sparling reminded the jury that David testified that he saw Cain spin the cylinder, not open it, and that Foster did not witness Cain reload his gun as Cain claimed. Sparling claimed that Cain was lying to the jury. Burleson spoke in defense of the client, telling the jury that their job was to ascertain the truth, not all become emotionally involved as the prosecution wanted. Burleson claimed the killing was out of poor judgement and stupidity, and that no man would have intentionally killed a child in front of three witnesses. Mulder closed the final arguments. He compared the arrests of the boys to Nazi Germany, and that while Burleson argued that it was a mistake of fact on the part of Cain in that he thought he unloaded his gun, Mulder argued that proper care of a reasonable man had to be exercised for there to be a mistake of fact. It was against the law for Cain to have pointed his gun at Santos, argued Mulder. He stated: > \\"And I will tell you, the only thing worse than killing a handcuffed child, > a 12-year-old child who is handcuffed in a squad car, who had been involved > in a burglary from a Fina station, the only thing worse than that...The only > thing worse than killing a child who is handcuffed, who is involved in a > burglary, is killing a child who was handcuffed who was totally blameless, > and totally innocent.\\" > After five and a half hours of deliberation, the jury found Cain guilty of murder or negligent homicide. Whether he was found guilty of murder with malice or guilty of murder without malice was decided during the punishment phase of the trial, which was scheduled for Friday, November 16. Final arguments were opened by Assistant DA Herman Gotcher, who argued for the prosecution's recommended murder with malice sentence. Gotcher argued that, as a police officer, Cain had to be held to a higher degree of responsibility for his actions than a layperson. The defense did not argue directly against a murder with malice sentence, and instead focused the crux of their argument on the need for leniency, probation rather than a prison sentence, due to Cain's time serving as a police officer. Gibson urged the jury to remember that Cain served on the police force for five and a half years and risked his life serving the citizens of Dallas, and that he deserved to rebuild what Gibson described as a shattered and torn life. Burleson argued that Cain would be subject to abuse in prison due to his service as a police officer, and that a prison sentence could be a death sentence for Cain. Sparling closed the arguments by calling for equality under the law, undermining the defense's request for leniency due to Cain's service. Sparling stated: > Now, what would you have us do, really? I mean, what are we to do, are we to > look at the defendant over here and focus on him and his look of designed > innocence and blind ourselves to the corpse of the boy he killed? If so, who > is to answer for the death of Santos Rodriguez? Who? Are we to hear his > cries and close our ears to the sobbing, mourning tears of those people that > mourn Santos Rodriguez? If so, who is to answer for the death of Santos > Rodriguez? Are we to do what Phil Burleson says, are we to wring our hands > and shrug our shoulders and nod our heads, say oh, it's a pity, but let's > give him probation. If so, then who is to answer for the death of Santos > Rodriguez? You? Me? The community at large? I refuse. After five and a half hours of deliberation, the same time it took to determine guilt, Cain was sentenced to five years in prison for murder with malice. A formal sentencing date was not set on the same day. Cain was freed on bond pending an appeal of his case. By 1975, he remained suspended from the Dallas Police force and worked outside of Dallas County. His attorney, Phil Burleson, argued that Cain deserved a new trial. By October 1975, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals still had not received the necessary files for appealing the case. The appeal hearing would determine whether Cain would be able to have a new trial or if he would be required to carry out his five-year sentence. Cain's defense attorneys planned to argue that Judge Gossett should have allowed Cain's \\"truth serum\\" test to be brought as testimony and that the prosecution's emotionally-charged attacks damaged Cain's case. In the spring of 1975, Burleson reported that court reporters and clerks were completing the records of the original trial and that the defense intended to request to Judge Gossett that the original trial be set aside. DA Henry Wade planned to oppose the plea. At this time Cain was working in Fort Worth and planned on appealing to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals if the request for a new trial was denied. On Wednesday, November 17, 1976, lawyers representing Cain asked for the Court of Criminal Appeals to order a new trial. On Wednesday, March 9, 1977, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Cain had received a fair trial and upheld the five-year sentence he was given. Cain continued to remain free on bond pending an appeal to the court. The case was eventually taken to the United States Supreme Court, and on Monday, October 3, 1977 the court refused to accept the case for review and upheld the murder conviction and five-year sentence. A brief prepared by Cain's defense claimed that the jury did not have sufficient freedom in their ruling, which eased the prosecution's ability to gain a murder conviction. The Texas Attorney General responded to this brief with his own, stating that the jury had been instructed that Cain was only to be found guilty if there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Cain voluntarily shot Santos, and to acquit Cain if Cain had acted under the mistaken assumption that the gun was unloaded and that Cain's mistake was due to lack of proper care. Cain ultimately served two and a half years of his five-year sentence. He served his time at the Texas Department of Corrections facility in Huntsville, Texas. He was classified as a state-approved trusty, which gave him privileged earning status, allowing him to meet his minimum discharge date on September 11, 1979. He had also earned the maximum amount of \\"good time\\", earning 30 days of credit for every 30 days he served. Cain had worked as a clerk in the diagnostic unit of the prison, and was described by director of the Texas Department of Corrections W. J. Estelle as a model prisoner. Cain was released on September 11, 1979, at 9:30 am, and was given a $200 check from the state of Texas as routine for Texas prisoners. Burleson stated that Cain had no interest in returning to work as a police officer, which Cain would have been unable to do as a convicted felon. Burleson stated that Cain sought to put his past behind him, and intended to move to a small town outside of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. == Legacy == In March 1978, the National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens (El Congreso) and the Mexican-American Legal Defense Educational Fund (MALDEF) urged then-President Jimmy Carter to investigate the treatment of Hispanics by law enforcement officers, citing several cases of police brutality including the shooting of Santos. At a League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) convention held in Laredo, Texas, on May 21, 1978, delegates passed a strongly worded resolution demanding that the US Department of Justice prosecute Darrell Cain for killing Santos. On Friday, June 23, 1978, President Carter met privately with a group of Mexican-American Democrats in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Houston, Texas to discuss the possibility of pursuing Civil Rights charges against Cain. Mexican Americans, including four State Legislators and members of Hispanic organizations, were in attendance. State Representative Ben Reyes showed color photographs of the body of Santos, which garnered an emotional reaction from President Carter, leaving him visibly upset. President Carter stated on Monday, June 26, that he had asked Attorney General Griffin Bell if Civil Rights charges should be filed. It had been reported that Assistant Attorney General Drew S. Days had recommended against filing Civil Rights charges, but President Carter refuted the report, claiming that no decision or recommendation had been made. President Carter's administration had until July 24, 1978, to open up an investigation before the closing of the five-year statute of limitations. The Dallas City Council was urged to join in the efforts of seeking a federal investigation of the shooting. Dallas Brown Berets, a delegation of Mexican- American citizens, and representatives from local Methodist churches met with the city council on Wednesday, June 28, 1978. Juan Perez, a member of the Dallas Brown Berets, held up a picture of Santos' body during the meeting. A resolution asking for a federal probe, police sensitivity training, and a statewide commission to review police brutality cases was presented to the council by Edwin Sylvest, theology professor at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and a member of the Rio Grande Methodist Conference. The resolution was adopted by the Casa View Methodist Church and Emanuel Methodist Church, and councilwoman Juanita Craft moved to adopt the resolution before she was convinced by Mayor Robert Folsom to table the proposal for three weeks. Folsom called the killing of Santos a tragic event, but was hesitant to adopt a resolution not written by City Council. Councilman Don Hicks compared the killing of Santos to the recent murder of his mother-in-law, lamenting that the killer would likely receive a short sentence and that her rights had been taken from her by her killer. Councilman Bill Nicol compared the Brown Berets to storm troopers attempting to intimidate the council, noting his belief that it was wrong to dredge up a past incident and that he did not believe the resolution backers represented the Mexican-American community at large. Nicol would later withdraw his comparison of the Brown Berets to storm troopers, but continued to state that he did not believe that Dallas should dwell on the tragedies and shortcomings of the past. On Friday, July 14, Justice Department spokesman Terry Adamson announced that the Justice Department would not be pursuing charges against Cain. Adamson cited legal problems that arose due to the length of time that passed between Cain's trial and the Justice Department's decision to bring charges in Civil Rights cases. Cain's case would have been tried retroactively, which could bring up issues of due process, and Attorney General Griffin Bell believed the issues that would arise from trying Cain led to questions of fairness and wisdom. This decision to not pursue charges also applied to Roy Arnold. Adamson stated that the decision was one of the hardest announcements he had to make due to Santos' age and the senselessness of his death. Ruben Bonilla, Texas state director of LULAC, called the decision unjustifiable and irresponsible, predicting that Carter would lose the election primaries if challenged by Jerry Brown or Ted Kennedy due to being incapable of securing the Chicano vote. Bonilla also saw Carter's attempts at securing rights for Russian dissidents while ignoring Mexican-American rights in Texas as hypocritical. Bonilla cited how a New York grand jury indicted a policeman over a 1973 shooting as proof that there was a precedent for retroactive applications of due process. School board member Robert Medrano believed that the decision would cause community heartache and create political repercussions. San Antonio attorney Ruben Sandoval, who had petitioned for the Justice Department to prosecute Cain, was saddened by the news and described the relationship between the Carter administration and Mexican-American communities as a bitter divorce. Bessie Rodriguez later revealed that she sent a letter to President Carter on July 18 expressing her feelings of hurt and betrayal. In her letter, Bessie revealed that she felt Carter had led the Mexican-American community to believe that charges would be filed during his state visit. She asked if Carter's daughter, Amy, had been killed, her killer would have received a light sentence, and stated that if Santos had killed a policeman his punishment would not have been as light as Cain's. On Thursday, July 20, 1978, President Carter called State Representative Ben Reyes regarding the decision to not pursue charges against Cain. Reyes reported that Carter personally apologized for the Justice Department decision, and understood that he had made a commitment to pursue charges that he was unable to keep. Carter told Reyes that he did not request that the department pursue or not pursue charges, but that he was embarrassed by the decision. Hours after the call, Carter stated that he did not have the inclination or authority to ask the Justice Department to reverse its decision. The office of Vice President Walter Mondale later called Reyes in order to attempt to arrange a meeting between Mexican-American leaders and Deputy Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti. On Sunday, July 17, 1978, a rally was held at Reverchon Park in memory of Santos. Members of the Committee for Justice, Perfecto Delgado and Olga Sepulveda, had organized it in the name of the committee, which was seen as an issue by self-proclaimed chairman Joe Landin, who denied the committee's involvement with the rally. The committee had been registered with the Texas Secretary under Landin's name, but Delgado insisted that the committee did not have a chairman, and that Landin was not a member. Around 650 people attended the rally. A satirical play was held and around half a dozen speeches were made. One of the speakers was Adolph Canales, a member of the Mexican-American assembly, who said in his speech that the rally was proof that the community was not going to sit back anymore. Pancho Medrano spoke on behalf of the United Auto Workers, and later said that he hoped his grandchildren would have better lives thanks to the efforts of the community. Afterwards, at about 8:30 pm, around 300 people marched from the park to the site of Santos' shooting and back. Despite Dallas Police maintaining a low profile at the park and Brown Berets breaking up groups they worried may cause trouble, there were a few incidents at the park after the march: a false stabbing was reported and bottles were thrown at police officers, allegedly by non-marchers, leading to a 15-minute confrontation between around 100 people and police at the entrance of the park. Three arrests were made. Attendees of the march cited their wish to protect children from future police brutality, and saw the rally and march as a starting point for community unity and proof that the community was still angry over the murder. One attendee, John Velas, stated that he used to play basketball with Santos, that other kids would not forget him and that they would make sure Dallas did not forget him. The Dallas Brown Berets led the coordination of a protest march in memory of Santos to take place on Saturday, July 22, 1978. The march was to assemble at 12:00 pm at Kennedy Plaza, proceed to old Dallas City Hall at 106 S. Harwood, and conclude around 3:30 pm at the new Dallas City Hall at 1500 Marilla St. Although as many as 1,000 marchers were expected, 300 marchers ultimately participated. The Brown Berets met with the Dallas Police Department to reassure their hopes and plans for a peaceful march, and the 50 riot-equipped tactical police assigned to the march kept out of sight of the marchers. Around 50 Brown Berets walked beside the marchers, and around 40 members of the Community of Churches were in attendance as neutral observers. Bessie Rodriguez was also in attendance, but left in tears after speaking to reporters, stating that her attorney told her the case for trying Cain was hopeless, and that while she appreciated the marcher's support, she lamented the size of the march. The majority of the marchers were Mexican Americans, and organizations in attendance included the Multi-Racial Committee for Justice, the American GI Forum, the Hispanic Organization of Women, and the National Organization of Women. Marchers chanted slogans such as \\"We want Justice\\", \\"Viva Santos\\", \\"Down with Carter, down with Bell\\", and \\"Viva la Raza\\". Awareness and memorials for Santos continued over the years. A park in Seattle, Washington is named after Santos. The Santos Rodriguez Memorial Park is located on 16th Ave S. and S. Lander St., and is the front yard of El Centro de la Raza, a non-profit organization. The Seattle cultural center celebrated the life of Santos Rodriguez on Day of the Dead in November 2015. Santos Rodriguez's mother attended the ceremony, which featured children singing to her and a poem dedicated to her son by Seattle's civic poet Claudia Castro Luna. From July 24 to July 26, 2013, a graveside ritual at Oakland Cemetery, a panel discussion at the Latino Cultural Center, and a community rally at Pike Park were held in honor of Santos. From July 2013 to August 2013, the Latino Cultural Center presented the exhibit Justicia: the Struggle for Mexican-American Civil Rights in Dallas, Texas, 1920–2012 in conjunction with the Dallas Mexican-American Historical League (DMAHL). The shooting of Santos was given special focus. Then-president of DMAHL Albert Valtierra highlighted how the murder galvanized the community, and invigorated the fight for civil rights for Mexican Americans in Dallas. Justicia exhibit interviews are now located at the Dallas History and Archives division of the Dallas Public Library. On Saturday, September 21, 2013, Mayor Mike Rawlings issued an apology for the death of Santos on behalf of the Dallas city council and Dallas police department, according to The Dallas Morning News and NBC5 DFW. Teatro Dallas produced a play called Santos, a Wandering Soul based on the murder of Santos. The play ran in 2013. In 2015, through a major donor, SMU established a Santos Rodriguez Memorial Endowed Scholarship for students studying Human Rights at SMU, according to SMU and The Dallas Morning News. Since 2016, Park board member Jesse Moreno, who was appointed by Dallas City Council member Adam Medrano, pushed for a park memorial for Santos and on October 18, 2018, the Dallas Park Board renamed the Pike Park Recreation Center to the Santos Rodriguez Center. As of July, 2018, the center was in need of extensive repairs. In 2018, the Santos Vive Project was established by Human Rights Dallas with the goals of creating a memorial to Santos, establishing a fund to financially assist his surviving relatives, and producing a documentary on the murder of Santos. In 2018, filmmaker Byron Hunter directed the documentary Santos Vive. The documentary debuted Tuesday, July 24, at the Texas Theatre in Oak Cliff. The SMU Embrey Human Rights Program along with Human Rights Dallas featured Santos' story in their Human Rights Map Project. ==See also== *Murder of Botham Jean *Mexicans in Dallas- Fort Worth == Sources == * == External links == *Civil Rights in Black and Brown: Oral History Project *Santos Rodriguez: The March of Justice — 1973 Category:1960 births Category:1973 deaths Category:1973 in Texas Category:Deaths by firearm in Texas Category:History of Dallas Category:Mexican-American history Category:Mexican-American culture in Texas Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:People from Dallas Category:People murdered in Texas Category:Race and crime in the United States ","title":"Murder of Santos Rodriguez"},{"id":"60422926","text":"The 1989 Campeonato Paulista da Primeira Divisão de Futebol Profissional was the 88th season of São Paulo's top professional football league.

At a young age, one of his brothers died in an accident and another was sent to prison for a long time; his father then became an alcoholic. This left him to fend for himself, so he dropped out of school and turned to crime. He was frequently arrested for dealing drugs, and was eventually charged with murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison when he was young, ultimately serving 10 years in prison from 1994 to 2004, and was then released but on probation until July 2013; he says he did not commit the crime and that everyone in the neighborhood knew it, but they all also knew that if he told authorities who the real shooter was then he would have been killed for speaking. In prison he became a leader to the weaker men, formed a band called 'Carblack', and became a preacher. After finding his spirituality, he worked hard to gain respect and eventually was placed in charge of the prison cafeteria, protecting food to be shared between everyone. After release, he studied Law at Universidad Santa María, and has been a motivational speaker at other institutions, in prisons, and for the 2009 Venezuela national under-20 football team before qualifying games for the 2009 World Cup. == Political career == When he was in prison, Caro listened to the speeches of Hugo Chávez, who he resonated with because Chávez had also been imprisoned around the same time and because he didn't like politicians, thinking they were \\"thieves\\". However, when he left prison after Chávez took office, he \\"felt that [Chávez] was going the wrong way\\". In 2007 he began working for Popular Will, and in 2009 he officially joined the party. In 2012, he was an advisor for the prison measures as part of Henrique Capriles' presidential campaign. Caro was first elected as an alternate deputy in 2015. One of the first things he mentioned as wanting the Assembly to achieve was an Amnesty Law to release all political prisoners. He was elected as a deputy in 2016. === 2017 incarceration === Caro in prison in 2018 Despite having parliamentary immunity, Caro was arrested arbitrarily by the government on 11 January 2017, accused of possession of military weapons and US dollars, and treason. After his arrest, his family were not told anything and did not get to see him for 73 days. He was released on 3 June 2018, aged 43, having never had a trial. In early March 2018, Caro was transported to another prison without the government informing anyone. Amnesty International then began investigating and asking for information, and a video of Caro in prison was quickly released to make certain his situation known. Caro was released in the second round of political prisoners after Maduro won re-election in 2018, all of them directly transferred to hospitals. He was weak and unhealthy when he was released, having suffered from gastrointestinal and bone problems during his time incarcerated, and said that he had spent a year isolated in a cell, sometimes going a whole month without being allowed out of it. In addition, he was not allowed to see his lawyers or family, and went on hunger strike for eight days. He was also in the Fénix prison in Lara during a riot where 11 men died. He announced that he wanted dialogue and reconciliation of the opposition Assembly and the government, to help release more political prisoners. The terms of his release mean he is still considered on probation and has to report his presence every 30 days, as well as not speak about his case. Four months after the releases, the military judge who had imprisoned Caro defected to Colombia after apologizing to him. === Activism === Gilber Caro strips in front of the Assembly Caro has always fought for human rights, with his sister describing him as a \\"social activist\\", and particularly focused on political prisoners both before and after he was incarcerated himself. In 2015, he opened a training center for ex-prisoners, hoping to reform them, which he named after Leopoldo López. This built on his work from 2013, when he started several programs for social reform to help ex-prisoners and at-risk people, including the foundations Liberados En Marcha, Dale La Mano A Tu Par, Santa En Las Cárceles and Educando Por La Paz. When Juan Requesens was detained and humiliated, Caro made an impassioned speech in the National Assembly on 14 August 2018, where he stripped to his underwear (like Requesens had been in a prison video) and said that a man's dignity is not measured by his state of dress, as part of national underwear protests in solidarity with his fellow politician. === 2019 disappearance and detentions === During the 2019 presidential crisis, Caro said that he did not want help from the \\"gringos\\" in the United States or military intervention to help Venezuela, saying \\"I am going to free my country\\". He later told Te Lo Cuento that \\"speaking in the first person\\" was a mistake, and that he meant all Venezuelans. On 26 April 2019, Caro was detained a second time. The National Assembly considers that the arrest goes against Caro's parliamentary immunity. OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro demanded “his immediate liberation”. The UN Human rights office demanded Maduro administration to update on Caro's whereabouts. UN representative Ravina Shamdasani insisted that Caro was not brought before a tribunal in the 48 hours after his detention as required by Venezuelan law. Amnesty International requested the Bolivarian Intelligence Service to handle information on Caro's whereabouts. Guaidó, the National Assembly, OAS General Secretary Almagro and the UN Human Rights office condemned the new arrest as a violation of parliamentary immunity. On 15 May, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued a protective measure on Gilber Caro and gave 7 working days to Maduro administration to report on Caro's well-being and process. By 24 May, Caro had still not been seen; his lawyer was informed that he was held at El Helicoide, but when people tried to reach him the guards at Helicoide said he was not being held there. One of Caro's sisters suggested that they were not allowed to see him because the guards \\"did something to him\\". On 30 May, magistrates announced that Caro would have a court hearing that day, to happen at Fort Paramacay in Naguanagua, but this did not happen; the court explained that it is not permitted to transport prisoners from Helicoide to Paramacay and so the hearing could not happen. On the evening of Monday 17 June, Caro was released. He was received by delegates from the Grupo de Boston, though his condition is unknown. Voice of America report that his freedom comes only a few days before the UN Human Rights Commission's planned inspection on 19 June. Though his lawyers informed the press, the Grupo de Boston were the first to know of his release. On 20 December, Caro was detained for a third time. Four other lawmakers were also indicted in December; Popular Will consider that Caro's detention is part of a series of actions by the Maduro administration to force a boycott of the reelection of Juan Guaidó as President of the National Assembly on 5 January 2020. On 21 January 2020, Caro's lawyer confirmed that the lawmaker was detained by Venezuelan special police forces (FAES). The lawyer was not allowed to disclose Caro's whereabouts. FAES operations usually focus on poor neighborhoods and the squad has been accused of carrying thousands of extrajudicial killings. This arrest would be the first time that FAES deals with a public figure. == Personal life == Caro has a daughter, and he also began acting as a paternal figure to his nephew after his sister's husband died. At least one of his sisters has left Venezuela, a departure he missed whilst in prison. His girlfriend is the activist Steyci Escalona. They first met over Twitter and started dating in 2011, though she had moved to Switzerland in 2007. == Notes == == References == Category:1974 births Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Venezuelan democracy activists Category:Political history of Venezuela Category:Venezuelan prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Venezuela Category:Politics of Venezuela Category:Popular Will politicians Category:Universidad Santa María (Venezuela) alumni Category:Living people Category:Forced disappearances in Venezuela Category:Members of the National Assembly (Venezuela) ","title":"Gilber Caro"},{"id":"60423023","text":"Chiloschista segawae is a species of leafless epiphytic or orchid that forms clumps with many radiating, flattened green roots.

Gravel's initial intention was not to win the nomination, but rather to inject his platform into the conversation so that his ideas become part of the mainstream, though he announced that he was \\"running to win\\" on April 29, possibly after realizing that a sham candidacy might disqualify Gravel from the primary debates.https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-farewell-to-mike- gravel-2020s-weirdest-presidential-candidate/ The campaign was also notable for its young leadership; manager David Oks and chief of staff Henry Williams were only 18 years old. The pair, and other young staffers, developed an online identity and fanbase as the \\"Gravel Teens.\\" The campaign reached 65,000 donors on July 12, 2019, officially qualifying him for the second Democratic presidential primary debate. However, he was left out of the debate as he only qualified via donations (which are given less weight than polling). Gravel indicated in July (as well as early August) that the campaign would come to a close soon, with Gravel's campaign staff stating on Twitter on August 5, 2019, that they will be \\"dropping out very soon\\". On August 6, 2019, Gravel officially dropped out and eventually endorsed Bernie Sanders, while simultaneously endorsing Tulsi Gabbard to be Sanders's running mate. Had Gravel won the 2020 election, he would have become the oldest president in American history, being 90 years old at the time of the inauguration in January 2021.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/mike- gravels-unlikely-democratic-presidential-campaign/586837/ == Background == Gravel has served in the U.S. Senate representing the state of Alaska from 1969 to 1981, as well as the Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives from 1965 to 1967. He gained national attention during his tenure in the Senate for his strong anti-war beliefs, specifically against the War in Vietnam. He garnered significant media attention by reading previously unreleased segments of the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record given to him by prominent democratic socialists Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, making them public knowledge via a loophole discovered by Daniel Ellsberg. Gravel's presidential bid was his second, following his 2008 campaign for president. In 2008, he was noted by pundits for his debate performances. However, he never reached significant polling numbers. On March 11, 2019, a discussion about Gravel came up on the 296th episode of the leftist comedy podcast Chapo Trap House, \\"The Unsullied\\", where one of the hosts, Felix Biederman, claimed \\"Mike Gravel is the only politician I ever felt, like, represented me.\\" Three days later, David Oks, a high school senior, and Henry Williams, a college freshman, both avid listeners of Chapo Trap House, persuaded the former senator to run for president through a phone call and assured him he would not travel too much. On March 20, the r/Gravelforpresident subreddit would be created and Williams' account 'u/Gravelanche' (in reference to the portmanteau often used by Gravel's campaign manager and supporters to nickname the campaign) would be added as moderator. == Campaign == === Exploratory committee === Gravel first entered the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries on March 19, 2019 by forming an exploratory committee. Late that day, Gravel's campaign posted on Twitter that he was not entering the campaign to win, rather to bring anti-war ideas to the Democratic debate stage, as well as that there would be a formal announcement in the coming days. His Twitter account was run by Oks and Williams who became the campaign manager and chief of staff, respectively. They posted attacks on other Democratic presidential candidates and potential candidates Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Beto O'Rourke while praising fellow candidates Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, including when Gravel urged them not to make personal attacks and rather focus on policy critiques. === Campaign announcement === On April 2, 2019, Gravel's exploratory committee filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission to officially run for the presidency. The campaign was announced on April 8 alongside Gravel's platform. That same day, the Mike Gravel YouTube channel posted a sequel to the viral \\"Rock\\" ad from Gravel's 2008 campaign with \\"Rock 2.0\\". On April 29, an email announcement went out stating that Gravel would now be running to win \\"[j]ust as much as Seth Moulton, John Delaney, John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan, or Eric Swalwell are.\\" In June 2019, Gravel touted the endorsement of Muntadher al- Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who, in December 2008, made headlines after he threw his shoes at President George W. Bush in protest of the U.S. war in Iraq. Al-Zaidi endorsed Gravel based on his promise to improve White House policies regarding Iraq and the Middle East. On June 13, 2019, the Democratic Party announced the 20 major candidates who qualified for the first debate later that month. Gravel was one of the four who were excluded (the others were Montana Governor Steve Bullock, U.S. Representative Seth Moulton, and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam). He had failed to get the requisite number of donations or to score one percent or better in enough polls; indeed he failed to reach that threshold in any poll, many of which did not include him. Updated June 13, 2019. Nevertheless, Gravel said he would not drop out and would try to qualify for the July debate. In early June 2019, FiveThirtyEight listed him as a \\"major candidate.\\" On July 12, the campaign announced it had reached 65,000 donations, meeting the donor threshold, but because the donor requirement was given less weight than polling he was not invited to appear at the second debate. === Suspension === On August 6, 2019, Gravel officially announced that he was suspending his campaign and co- endorsed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard for president. He then later endorsed Howie Hawkins for the Green Party == Political positions == The campaign's platform was released on April 7 to coincide with the campaign launch. It was released as a live Google Doc and the campaign asked for requests for amendments via Twitter. In response to the Black Socialists in America, Gravel self-described as someone who supports \\"us moving towards a society where the workers control the means of production in a democratic and decentralized fashion\\". === Foreign policy === Gravel's campaign was based around bringing a critique of American imperialism and general American foreign policy to the Democratic debate stage. Foreign policy would include: * Acceding to the 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons * Signing and ratifying the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons * Officially declaring that the U.S. will not be the first to use nuclear weapons. * Repealing the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists * Renaming the Department of Defense to the 'Department of War', as well as creating a Department of Peace * Reforming the United Nations Security Council * Ending all unilateral sanctions against foreign countries * Ending military aid to Israel and Saudi Arabia * Ending sales of arms by companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to foreign countries * Officially ending the Korean War, promoting cultural exchange between North Korea and South Korea, reuniting families separated by the war, apologizing to victims of the Jeju uprising and No Gun Ri massacre and potentially offering compensation * Closing every foreign military base, beginning with those in Muslim-majority countries * Cutting military spending by 50% * Vowing not to invade foreign countries like North Korea or Venezuela without a first attack against the U.S. by that country * Pursuing friendly relations with all foreign countries, including North Korea, despite the U.S.' opinions of their governing leaders * Rejoining the Iran nuclear deal === Civil rights === The campaign sought to reduce the number of intelligence agencies from 17, including the abolition of the National Security Agency, as well as a U.S. withdrawal from the Five Eyes network, the ending of the PRISM surveillance program, and repealing of the Patriot Act and the Espionage Act. The campaign viewed many of these programs and organizations to be a 'trampling' of Americans' civil rights \\"in the rush to enhance security following 9/11\\". Whistleblowers Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, John C. Kiriakou, Julian Assange, Reality Winner, and Terry Albury would be given pardons and some would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The campaign also focuses on \\"full equality for all of America's LGBTQIA+ people, with a special focus on transgender rights.\\" This included an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the addition of a ban on discrimination due to \\"sexual orientation and/or gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, and credit\\", honoring transgender rights activist Marsha P. Johnson and author James Baldwin with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, banning conversion therapy nationwide and making the operation of a conversion therapy clinic a crime. === Political reform === The campaign wanted to abolish the Electoral College and replace it with a system of direct election. The platform stated it was because \\"[it] has been responsible for two Presidents within the last three winning an election without winning a majority of the votes\\", referring to the 2000 election of George W. Bush and the 2016 election of Donald Trump, and also because it \\"was a tool originally created to suppress democracy; historically, it has empowered slavers and segregationists.\\" The campaign also stated it \\"distorts democracy\\" by giving weight to voters like Floridian Cuban-Americans and Iowan farmers and reducing the weight of voters in cities. The campaign also wants to put all elections under Congressional oversight, citing \\"restrictive\\" voter ID laws and the election fraud in the 2018 election of Representative Mark Harris in North Carolina, as well as registering all U.S. citizens for voting once they turn 18, instituting national ranked choice voting, adopting the Wyoming Rule, and passing an amendment that would make the voting power of a state's senators proportional to the state's population. The campaign also supported a 12-year term limit for Supreme Court justices. == Media coverage == Coverage of the campaign was largely limited to online and print journalism. Interviews with Gravel and Williams appeared in a segment of the April 18, 2019 episode of Vice News Tonight. On April 10, 2019, a piece entitled \\"Mike Gravel's Plan to Rock the Democratic Primary\\" appeared in The Atlantic. A long profile of the campaign as well as Oks and Williams appeared in the June 9, 2019 issue of The New York Times Magazine. Articles regarding the campaign appeared in Splinter News, Vox, Rolling Stone, Current Affairs, Jezebel and Politico, among other outlets. Additionally, Gravel discussed his candidacy in television news interviews. On June 10, 2019, he appeared on CBS News and related how he gave Oks and Williams his Twitter account, while they gave him \\"veto power, which I've only exercised once, by warning them about rough language.\\" In the same interview, he also praised Oks and Williams and called them \\"unbelievably precocious.\\" The publication Jacobin interviewed Gravel in June 2019, referring to him as \\"the anti-Joe Biden\\". == Controversies == Mike Gravel's exploratory committee was immediately met with allegations of Gravel being a 9/11 truther, having called for a new investigation into the 9/11 attacks in 2011. He has also allegedly associated with alleged antisemites and Holocaust deniers, including attending conferences sponsored by Lyndon LaRouche and appearing on the podcast of Kevin Barrett. The Gravel campaign replied to these reports stating Gravel \\"totally, unequivocally disavow\\" Barrett and that Gravel was \\"not familiar with his statements on the Holocaust or the Jewish community\\". The campaign added that Gravel had appeared on these mediums for the sake of getting exposure of his ideas to as many people as possible, and noted Gravel himself had not made any of these statements, as well as the influence American Jews had on Gravel's political ideology. ==Endorsements== == References == Gravel Category:Mike Gravel ","title":"Mike Gravel 2020 presidential campaign"},{"id":"60423288","text":"Minos Kalokairinos (Μίνως Καλοκαιρινός, 1843, Heraklion - 1907, Heraklion) was a Cretan Greek business person and an amateur archaeologist.

His excavations were later continued by Arthur Evans. == Biography == He was the youngest of the sons of Andreas Kalokairinos, a rich landowner, who owned, in particular, the site of the Cnossian palace. He obtained secondary education on the isle of Syros, then enrolled at the law faculty of the University of Athens where he only studied a year. His father's illness forced him to return to Heraklion. After his father passed away, he took over his soap manufacturing business together with his brother Lysimachos Kalokairinos. In 1869 he married Skevo Kyriazi, with whom he had 5 children. In 1895 his enterprise went bankrupt. In 1903 he resumed his legal studies. == Excavations == The initial excavation began as early as 1877 on the Kephala hill, which was followed by full-scale excavations in 1878, but the Turkish authorities who controlled the island back then forced him to stop excavations just 3 weeks later. Nevertheless, he managed to discover parts of the west wing of the palace, namely the storage rooms, as well as a corner part of the throne hall. News of his excavations awoke interest among many archaeologists, such as W.J. Stillman, Heinrich Schlieman and finally Sir Arthur John Evans , who finally managed to excavate the whole palace after the island got independence from the Turks. == Collection == Minos Kalokairinos had a large collection of objects found during his excavations. During the violent events of August 25, 1898, when the Turks tried to suppress the Cretan revolt, his home was pillaged and burnt, and his collection was heavily damaged; only the rarest object survived, which were kept separately: these were mostly amphoras found in the western wing of the palace, which he later donated to museums of Greece, Paris and London in order to promote the public interest for Cnossos. == References == == External links == * Site of the city of Heraklion * Site of the archaeological museum of Heraklion Category:1907 deaths Category:1843 births Category:Minoan civilization Category:Greek archaeologists Category:People from Heraklion Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"Minos Kalokairinos"},{"id":"60423292","text":"Chad Mullane (born November 28, 1979Yoshimoto Creative Agency - Official Talent Profile (Japanese) Retrieved on 5 April 2019) is an Australian comedian, actor, writer, director, translator, academic and producer based in Japan.Toyo Keizai Online Author Profile (Japanese) Retrieved on 5 April 2019.President Online Author Profile (Japanese) Retrieved on 5 April 2019.ABC Australia Radio Life Matters Chaddo: making Japan laugh (May 13, 2008) Retrieved on 5 April 2019Japan Times Website - Chad's Seminar at Japan Times HQ to commemorate renewal and new column (June 1, 2018).

She currently lives in the Mar Vista suburb of Los Angeles. She grew up in different cities, including Tijuana, San Diego, and the most influential city to her work: Los Angeles. Her contribution to the art field has been apparent in museums including Los Angeles at Art+Practice, Self Help Graphics, and at The Museum of Contemporary Art. Her work focuses mainly on culture and history. Her artwork portrays the cultural, political, and social change that communities undergo through different periods of time, specifically in the Los Angeles areas. Rodriguez's inspiration was sparked when she took a family trip to Oaxaca, a southern Mexican Region. Whilst she was there, looking through stores she found a red pigment called cochineal, coming from the pre-Columbian era. Prior to this, Sandy Rodriguez had experience with making colors using natural resources such as plants, insects, and oxides. Rodriguez did not know how to use this newfound pigment that was similar to her handmade pigments. She had heard about the uprisings in Ayotzinapa Mexico, with thousands of people protesting and setting the presidential place on fire, where the president Enrique Pena Nieto resided. These uprisings and revolts happened because 43 students from Ayotzinapa were killed by police and gang members. She then decided to compare this historical moment along with the fires in California Hills in her artwork using her bottle of Cochineal. All of her artwork escalated from thereon, pinpointing Latin history, politics and culture. One of her many occupations as an artist include teaching in constituencies and programs to inspire a new generation of artist and to continue pushing the boundaries of art. == Education == With an intention of pursuing art, Sandy Rodriguez attended the California Institute of Arts,1993.

Later on, she went on to receive her Bachelor in Fine Arts from CalArts and has actively overlooked various art programs. == Artworks == *Codex Rodriguez-Mondragon: Her most recent doings are Codex Rodriguez- Mondragón, which are numerous maps and paintings dealing with the issues of politics, culture and location, all interconnecting with one another. This project is a reflection of her political stance and culture perspective in both Mexico and Southern California. The themes include resistance, culture and genocide. Sandy Rodriguez has intersected significant time periods in her Codex Rodriguez-Mandragon project, including the Spanish invasion and the current ICE and immigration deportations. More specifically she included a visual comparison of the invading Spanish vessels and the recent weaponry used by the U.S. border control enforcement. This work was inspired from Book 12 and the Florentine Codex and from her 2017 experiments with Mexican and Pre- Columbian resources.

Her artwork is her interpretation of classical music and is defined with shapes and symbols within her artwork. She also includes religious notions affiliated with the high quality of music. She also believes that music is unique to everyone, therefore she decides to primarily include it in her art. == Biography == Elena Presser was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and has also lived in Florida, California, and Philadelphia. It was in Buenos Aires at age 18, when her interest towards Bach's musical pieces grew substantially, and even more specifically on the Goldberg Variations. Aria with Diverse Variations for a Harpsichord with Two Manuals was a series of piano pieces composed by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach in 1741 which contained the final music series titled Goldberg Variations. Presser often repeatedly listened to the Goldberg Variations in order to detect the underlying differences among the musical composition and its features. Re-listening to these pieces helped Presser transform Bach's compositions into a visual representation and three dimensional form of keyboard music. Presser's various artworks contain numerous forms of medium in which she arranges her interpretation of the Goldberg Variations to her personal tastes. Presser has done interpretations of other music compositions including pieces from the Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical era. == Education == Presser received her education from various universities. In 1962, she attended the University of Buenos Aires and later attended Miami-Dade Community College where she attained an associate of arts. Furthermore, Presser enrolled in the University of Miami in 1976 and to Florida International University where she received a bachelor of fine arts degree. == Art work == Unfinished Symphony, 1982: Presser used silk ribbon, wire, paper, pastel, pencil, and silk thread. Presser included a symphony by Austrian composer Franz Schubert. According to Presser, the Unfinished Symphony has both a dramatic drop and a tragic touch to the notes. She assembles the emotions attached to the notes of this symphony by working her way outwards the canvas, with the slow tragedy centered in the middle and the greater tragedy splashed throughout her canvas. Presser intended for the second movement of notes to be more serene and joyous. The middle portion of the canvas includes a cluster of tiles with scattered numbers and letters embedded with darker shades of colors. These tiles were meant to represent the tragic energy evoked by the chords. Plate III Variation 20 from the Goldberg Variations, 1984: This piece of art included silver wire, paper, nails, pastel, silk thread and pencil. This piece was based on Variation 20 from the Goldberg Variations and has numerous strings stretching from top to bottom, all aligned at the bottom to holes. This symmetrical formation of strings, where each depict a beat, are reflected both vertically and horizontally and were created to form a harpsichord. The strings are held together at the top in a v-shaped form from a top angle, and represents the intensity of human joy and tempo emanating from these chords. The calligraphy inscribed among the structure is the artistic signature of Presser that is constantly seen throughout her various other artworks. Variation 3, 1983: This artwork consists of sterling silver wire, handcrafted paper, silk thread, pencil and pastel and is based on Variation 3 from the Goldberg Variations. Variation 3 had a time signature of 12/8. This time signature was often regarded as a celestial note by Bach and was an influence to the choice of color in this artwork. This variation has a religious affiliation in regards to Bach and Presser due to the constant recurring theme of unification. On the left side of the canvas there is a script folded in half which is used to depict the unified canon. Among this piece there is a lot of play with light and shadow which causes the three dimensional design of this canvas. There is also calligraphy written on the scroll which is the artistic signature of Elena Presser. Variation 14, 1983: The media for this artwork consists of sterling silver wire, silk thread, handcrafted paper, pastel, nails, and pencils. On the top middle portion of this canvas there is a pentagon with a smaller pentagon inside of it coming out of the page. The words 14 variations are inscribed in this inner pentagon. The rest of the canvas consists of colorful strings stretched vertically from top to bottom, without overlapping the pentagon located on the top middle portion. However, there is another pentagon reflecting the top pentagon on the center of the canvas. This pentagon has the words Bach Variation G inscribed on it. The pentagon's represent the fifth triad which is three note chords that play simultaneously. There is both mirth and sadness evoked in this piece of artwork with the different colors of strings and notes. Variation 15, 1983: This media of this artwork is hand crafted paper, pastel, strings, and wires. Variation 15 is from the Golden Variations produced by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Presser assembles various geometric shapes that has a strong affiliation with religion and music. On the center of the canvas there is a large circle with an inner square. On top of the rectangle, square and circle there is strings stretched horizontally from the left end to the right end of the canvas. These strings are created to depict a cross to represent the concept of balance. This artwork compares the Variation 9's perfection and divinity with God, especially the canon at the fifth. We also see human perfection inscribed in the shape of the pentagon, with all its five points representing the human anatomy. The pentagon, which consists of five points, also shows the infinite power and unity of humankind along with music notes canon 5 to show music's affiliation with celestial matters. Calligraphy inscribed all over the canvas is the artist's artistic signature. Variation 26, 1984: The media for this artwork is silk threads, pastel, hand-crafted paper, and beads. There is a circle that covers mostly the whole rectangle canvas. The circle embedded in this piece represent unity and comfort. On the inside of the circle there is strings stretching towards the center of the circle. The strings reinforce these feelings of security and the sense of infinite solace. There is two triangles at the center of the circle that serve as the identity of male and female spirits. The number nine on this canvas represents religious practices of prayers. Variation 26 is dedicated to the Golden Variations composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. The calligraphy in the background is the artist's artistic signature. Variation 9, 1983: This artwork includes handcrafted paper, sterling silver wire, pastel, pencil, and thread. Variation 9 from the Golden Variations was composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. The bottom portion of this canvas has two symmetrical rectangles that are laying horizontally. These three horizontal rectangles emphasizes the canon at the third wherein they represent three levels of reality. The first level of reality is symbolized as two lines forming a peak that represent religious creation, the Holy Trinity, and Heaven. Inside this peak there is a circle that symbolizes the circle of life and is regarded as the 2nd level of reality. The last level of reality is the three bottom rectangles that represent the reality of music within the canons of this variation. The calligraphy among the back of this canvas is the artistic signature of Elena Presser. Variation 29, 1984: This is a mixed media that includes handcrafted paper, pencil, thread, and pastel. On the middle there is a pentagon with a decagon inside, and inside that decagon there is star with 10 peaks, and inside that start there is a circle. The pentagon is on a rectangle made out of stretched strings. There are circle outside the triangle that have letters inscribed on them. The rest of the canvas has letters and symbols. Variation 29 was produced by the Golden Variations by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The golden variations were created in a symmetrical structure, which is being represented in Elena's Presser's interpretation of Variation 29. Elena Presser is interpreting the movement of this variation as a sonorous dance with the rectangle and the number six being the foundation of the dance. There is a mystical tree that serves as an emblem of divine morals affiliated with God. == Group Exhibitions == #Contemporary Art - 1977, Continuum Gallery, Miami #Two Person Exhibition - 1978, Visual Arts Gallery, F.I.U., Miami #Women Artists of the '70's - 1978, National Organization for Women, Fort Lauderdale #21st M.

He was ordained to the priesthood there on 10 October 1983. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 1 July 1991, and held posts in Burundi, Japan, Austria, the Czech Republic, the European Community and the United States. He is fluent in English, Italian, French, Spanish and Czech. On 8 September 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named him titular archbishop of Taborenta and Apostolic Nuncio in Guinea and Mali. He welcomed the assignment, describing Guinea as \\"a predominately Islamic country in which Islam is not lived fanatically\\". On 8 May 2013, Pope Francis appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Palau, and Micronesia, as well as Apostolic Delegate to the Pacific Ocean. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone on 16 November. On 23 September, Francis added Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu to his responsibilities. On 18 January 2014, he added Tonga as well, and on 3 May the Marshall Islands and Nauru. While fulfilling this array of assignments he used Wellington, New Zealand, as his base. On several occasions he played a role in the affairs of the troubled Archdiocese of Agaña on Guam, trying to reconcile disputing parties in 2014, receiving a report that Archbishop Anthony Apuron had sodomized a boy years earlier in 2015, and trying without success to persuade Apuron to resign in 2016.

Bowden's nonverbal techniques for influence and persuasion have been described in the Canadian national press as a “secret weapon” for G7 leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper. His techniques derive from evolutionary psychology, behavioral psychology, and embodied cognition. Most notable is Bowden's GesturePlane System, and the specific use of open palm hand gestures in what he coins as the \\"TruthPlane\\" (the horizontal plane at navel height on the human body) to create feelings of trust, credibility, and confidence when communicating. This model was first put forward in his 2010 book, Winning Body Language. He is the President of The National Communication Coach Association of Canada. Bowden is a commentator for national news networks globally on the body language of senior politicians. During US Presidential and Canadian Federal elections and debates, along with subsequent diplomatic meetings, he has commented in the international and national press and on network news worldwide on the body language of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Justin Trudeau, and Andrew Scheer. Bowden contributes to GQ magazine on modern male culture and behavior. He has also commented on the nonverbal behavior of Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial arts fighters Ronda Rousey, Conor McGregor and Jon Jones for Vox Media's SBNation. == Early life == Bowden was born in Northampton, England, educated at Weston Favell School, and trained on the site of the former secret intelligence service, GCHQ base of MI19, Trent Park, at Middlesex University, London, graduating 1991, (BA Hons, Performing Arts). Bowden concurrently studied between 1989 and 1995 in London with French masters of physical theatre and the psychology of movement, Philippe Gaulier and Jacques Lecoq; Italian Nobel Prize winner and satirical comedian, Dario Fo; Canadian improvisational theatre master, Keith Johnstone; the British acrobat Johnny Hutch MBE. and with the internationally acclaimed Theatre de Complicite. == Performance == ===Film, theater, and TV=== From 1991 to 2007 Bowden performed in film, theatre, and television, including: * The 1992 UK London West End premiere of Six Degrees Of Separation at the Royal Court Theatre and the Comedy Theatre. *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). *Yin Yang Yo! (2006). === The Nike Streaker === Mark Bowden notoriously starred in the 2003 Nike Streaker Super Bowl ad, lauded by AdWeek as one of the top ten soccer commercials ever made. Shot by British director, Frank Budgen at Millwall Football Club, the ad—in which a streaker (Bowden) clad only in a long scarf and a pair of Nike Shox NZ running shoes darts across the field during an English soccer game, dodging police—prompted calls and emails to Nike asking whether the incident was real. This led to Bowden being awarded a Nude of The Week in Sports Illustrated, and earned him heavy criticism from the US Christian Evangelist activist group, Concerned Women For America who lobbied for Bowden to be banned from US national TV. The ad was voiced by comedian, Steve Coogan. In February, 2003, Reebok released a commercial featuring linebacker Terry Tate that parodies the Nike Streaker commercial; in the Reebok ad, Tate tackles a streaker then proclaims, \\"You just did it, so I had to hit it\\". This advertisement was one of several competitive and deliberate spoofs of the Nike Streaker Ad from rival companies. == British Council == In 2002 Bowden worked as a cultural attache for The British Council in Tel Aviv, Israel at the Habima Theatre, as associate director on Seven Days with controversial Palestinian Arab Israeli actor and film director, Mohammad Bakri in the lead role. Bowden also worked as an adviser to the Arts Council of Great Britain and was supported by The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in his arts teaching work across the UK and abroad. == TEDx Toronto == In 2013, Bowden was chosen as a speaker for the 5th Annual TEDx Toronto to deliver a speech around the theme of \\"The Choices We Make\\". On September 26, 2013 at The Royal Conservatory of Music, Bowden delivered his speech The Importance Of Being Inauthentic. == Bibliography == === Books === * Mark Bowden and Tracey Thomson, Truth and Lies: What People Are Really Thinking (HarperCollins, 2018) * Mark Bowden, Tame the Primitive Brain: 28 Ways in 28 Days to Manage the Most Impulsive Behaviors at Work (Wiley, 2013) * Mark Bowden with Andrew Ford, Winning Body Language for Sales Professionals: Control the Conversation and Connect with Your Customer―without Saying a Word (McGraw-Hill, 2013) * Mark Bowden, Winning Body Language: Control the Conversation, Command Attention, and Convey the Right Message without Saying a Word (McGraw-Hill, 2010) == References == Category:Living people Category:1970 births Category:People from Northampton Category:Alumni of Middlesex University ","title":"Mark Bowden (English author)"},{"id":"60423637","text":"Abraham Revusky (1889 - February 8, 1946) was a Ukrainian-born, US-based politician, author and editor.
