His first marathon was the Houston Marathon in 1984, which he won by \\"the thickness of a vest\\". Spedding followed this by winning the London Marathon in 1984 and the bronze medal for Great Britain in the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, United States, finishing just 2 seconds behind silver medallist John Treacy. Although it was the first British Olympic marathon medal for 20 years, and the last won by Britain (male or female), the performance was one of 16 British medals in athletics that year, and it possibly did not get the recognition it deserved. In 1985 he set a PB and English Marathon record of 2:08.33 (which stood until 2014) when he finished second behind Steve Jones in the London Marathon. He is the third fastest British marathon runner after Jones and Mo Farah. He represented England in the marathon event, at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1987, he finished 8th in the London Marathon in 2:10.32. He also competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, finishing 6th. ==Post athletics== Spedding is a pharmacist by trade. In September 2009, he published an autobiography of his running career called From Last to First. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Sunderland in 2012.Nicola Weatherall, \\"Sunderland University to honour Eddie Izzard, Charlie Spedding and Alastair Stewart\\", The Journal, 5 July 2012 In November 2019 he published a book Stop Feeding Us Lies: How Health and Happiness Come to Those Who Seek the Truth which examines dietary recommendations and lifestyle approaches which he analyses as being causes of high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other illnesses. ==Achievements== { - !colspan=\\"7\\"Representing - rowspan=31984 Houston Marathon Houston, United States bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  1st Marathon 2:11:54 - London Marathon London, United Kingdom bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  1st Marathon 2:09:57 - Olympic Games Los Angeles, United States bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\"  3rd Marathon 2:09:58 - 1985 London Marathon London, United Kingdom bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  2nd Marathon 2:08:33 - 1986 Chicago Marathon Chicago, United States bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\"  3rd Marathon 2:10:13 - 1987 London Marathon London, United Kingdom 8th Marathon 2:10:32 - rowspan=21988 London Marathon London, United Kingdom 10th Marathon 2:12:28 - Olympic Games Seoul, South Korea 6th Marathon 2:12:19 } == References == ==External links== * Charlie Spedding: We're running out of time for legacy in the Independent * Article from 2003 in the Evening Chronicle * From Last to First * Power of 10 UK Men's Marathon Rankings * Power of 10 Profile: Charlie Spedding Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bishop Auckland Category:English male marathon runners Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for England Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1982 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1986 Commonwealth Games Category:London Marathon male winners Category:People educated at Durham School Category:Alumni of the University of Sunderland Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics ","title":"Charlie Spedding"},{"id":"7788541","text":"Horizontal eccentricity refers to the horizontal axis, measured in degrees, along the visual field.

A teenage boy is struck on the head in a lacrosse game and is found to have hallucinations and night terrors that are not due to concussion. ==Plot== When a clinic patient claims to have an appointment with the diagnostic department, House is skeptical of the letter which he himself supposedly wrote to the family. House realizes that it was written by Cameron, but listens when he hears that one of the symptoms is night terrors. The patient, Dan (Scott Mechlowicz), is a 16-year-old lacrosse player who has been recently hit in the head in a game. House suggests that the night terrors were a result in post-traumatic stress disorder from sexual abuse and his double vision was caused by a concussion and/or eye strain. Then he notices Dan's foot twitch with a myoclonic jerk which normally only occurs when falling asleep. He immediately admits Dan and starts diagnosis with his team. House claims that Dan's father is not his true biological father and makes a bet with Foreman. None of the tests show why the night terrors occurred, but House finds a large blockage in one of Dan's brain ventricles. House and his team relieve the pressure, but they find that the blockage is not causing the other symptoms. During the night, Dan is found missing from his bed. Cameron, Chase, and Foreman soon locate him on the roof, where he is hallucinating that he is on the lacrosse field. House is excited by this new development — it rules out his previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The new diagnosis provided by Cameron is neurosyphilis. To treat this, they inject penicillin through a lumbar puncture, but during the injection Dan suffers an auditory hallucination, which rules out this diagnosis. House is stumped by this new development, and admits his problems to Wilson. Dan's parents are angered to discover House having coffee with Wilson while their son is dying. After House quickly elaborates in great detail exactly what Dan's condition is it at the time, he tells them to go and support Dan, after which he takes their coffee cups to run DNA tests. The tests show that neither parent is biologically related to Dan. House remembers a baby he treated earlier whose mother did not want to vaccinate the child and hypothesizes that infant Dan may have caught the measles virus, which remained latent for 16 years. Avoiding a dangerous procedure to confirm this unusual case, they biopsy Dan's retina to find the virus, confirming House's diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Dan recovers fully after brain surgery and reveals that he already knew he was adopted, but that he does not care. ==Medical aspects== The sequence of tentative diagnoses in this case was: #Sexual abuse #Concussion #Degenerative disease #Hydrocephalus #Multiple sclerosis #Neurosyphilis #Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis The treatment for the final diagnosis was to inject interferon into the brain. The story exaggerates the difficulty of explaining this treatment for dramatic effect but the problem of obtaining informed consent in complex cases is a real one. The medical advisor for this episode was Lisa Sanders. Error: The biopsy of the retina is taken with a needle through the central cornea, which would not be an optimum site due to scarring. Additionally, the needle moves \\"through the pupil\\", ignoring the crystalline lens located directly behind the pupil. Finally, the biopsy would seemingly be taken in the central retina known as the fovea - the area of the most sensitive vision, again leading to unnecessary permanent damage to the patient's central vision. ==Recurring themes== The theme that \\"everybody lies\\" appears here in the question of the patient's paternity. The parents had lied to him in not telling him that he was adopted and do not admit this to House either. ==Reception== Robert Bianco, writing in USA Today, recommended the episode as \\"first-rate\\". ==References== ==External links== * \\"Paternity\\" at Fox.com * * Category:House (season 1) episodes Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Measles in fiction Category:Medical diagnosis it:Episodi di Dr. House - Medical Division (prima stagione)#Problemi di adozione ","title":"Paternity (House)"},{"id":"7788605","text":"Stephen Hammerton (fl. 1629-47) was a boy player or child actor in English Renaissance theatre, one of the young performers who specialized in female roles in the period before women appeared on the stage. His case illuminates the conditions of boy actors in this era. ==Beginnings== Stephen Hammerton was the son of a Richard Hammerton of Hellifield, Yorkshire. In his youth he was apprenticed to a London merchant tailor, William Waverly, of the Strand. At the time, veteran actors Richard Gunnell and William Blagrave, founders of the Salisbury Court Theatre, were struggling to form a new company of child actors, similar to the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's of thirty years before.Peter Thomson et al., eds., The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; Vol. 1, p. 149. Those troupes, famous in their own time, had been highly effective at training young actors and funnelling them into the adult companies that needed their talent; but the troupes of boy players had been defunct for nearly fifteen years when Blagrave and Gunnell started their Children of the Revels troupe in 1629. The relevant documents indicate clearly that part of the project's rationale was the training of young actors for the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. Blagrave had encountered the young Hammerton and decided that the Children of the Revels needed him. Blagrave purchased the remaining nine years of Hammerton's apprenticeship contract from Waverly in October 1629. (Hammerton allegedly agreed to this change; it happened \\"by and with his own liking.\\") This was not a unique transaction; there are other instances on record in which actors and theatre managers effectively bought the services of boys for their troupes.Viviana Comensoli and Anne Russell, Enacting Gender on the English Renaissance Stage, Champaigne, University of Illinois Press, 1999; p. 184. ==King's Men== Unfortunately, the new boys' company failed to attain success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to bubonic plague at the time. According to one report, the boys were left without adequate food and clothing; fourteen boys had seven shirts among them, and one of the fourteen died of neglect. Hammerton fared better, though; sometime in 1632 he jumped to, or was recruited into, the King's Men. His transition was not without controversy; manager Blagrave was involved in a lawsuit over control of the apprentice actor.G. E. Bentley, \\"The Salisbury Court Theater and Its Boy Players,\\" Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 40 No. 2 (February 1977), pp. 129-49. In November 1632, Blagrave joined with William Beeston in a petition to the Lord Chamberlain to recover custody of Hammerton. Beeston's involvement in the matter is cryptic, and the Blagrave/Beeston suit was unsuccessful;Bentley, pp. 143-4, 148-9. Hammerton remained with the King's Men and acted for them for the next ten years, till the theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. ==Female to male== Hammerton started out by playing female roles, as would be expected; in 1632 he played Oriana, the heroine in John Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase. In 1633, when William Prynne published Histriomastix, the Players' Scourge, his famous attack on the theatre and the players, he singled out Hammerton as \\"a most noted and beautiful woman-actor.\\" By the late 1630s Hammerton transitioned from female to male roles. He played in Sir John Suckling's The Goblins, James Shirley's The Doubtful Heir, and Thomas Killigrew's The Parson's Wedding.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company 1594-1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 229. Amyntor in the Beaumont and Fletcher play The Maid's Tragedy was the type of \\"juvenile lead\\" part for which he became famous. He acquired a reputation as a sort of 17th-century matinee idol, especially favored by the young women in the audience. The Epilogue to The Goblins comments on Hammerton's popularity: ::The women -- Oh if Stephen should be killed, ::Or miss the lady, how the plot is spilled? Killigrew makes the same point at the end of The Parson's Wedding: if \\"Stephen misses the Wench...that alone is enough to spoil the Play.\\" (Hammerton's celebrity was such that he was identifiable by his first name alone -- much like celebrities of later centuries.) Hammerton was made a Groom of the Chamber on 22 January 1641, along with five other King's Men. After the theatres closed in 1642, Hammerton's fortunes, like those of the other King's Men, were eclipsed and obscured. He was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication to the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647. ==References== Category:King's Men (playing company) Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:17th-century English male actors Category:English male stage actors Category:Boy players ","title":"Stephen Hammerton"},{"id":"7788622","text":"Union Sportive Pont-de-Roide Vermondans is a French association football team founded in 2003.

He is a two-time winner of the World Indoor Championships (1987, 1989) and a two-time winner of the World Cup (1979, 1989). He also won a bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and bronze medals at the World Championships in 1987 and 1991. ==Career== Myricks was born in Clinton, Mississippi. A durable jumper, he first broke onto the track scene in 1976. While competing for Mississippi College, he was the NCAA Champion in the long jump. He followed that with a second place at the U. S. Olympic Trials, beating defending Olympic champion Randy Williams in the process. At the 1976 Olympics, he broke his foot while warming up for the final and was unable to compete. His teammates Arnie Robinson and Williams finished 1 and 2. The three American jumpers had been easily the top three jumpers in qualifying. In 1979 he won again the NCAA Championship, this time both indoors and outdoors. He was also the US National Champion (27–2), and World Cup Champion (8.52 m). He repeated as U.S. national champion in 1980 and in 1989. He competed for the United States at the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, South Korea, where he won the bronze medal in the men's long jump competition. In addition to the 1976 Olympics, Myricks won the 1980 Olympic Trials (over a young Carl Lewis), the team that did not go to the Olympics due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. As consolation, he received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. He finished second to Lewis in the 1984 Olympic Trials.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/usatf/files/69/695a8112-b7a0-4b9d-9dbb-8b4bca22677c.pdf He finished fourth in the Olympics that year. He set his personal best of 8.74 m (28' 8\\") in the long jump at the 1988 Olympic Trials. That jump still ranks Myricks as the number 5 long jumper ever. It was the trials record, for a few minutes, until surpassed by Carl Lewis. After qualifying for four straight Olympic teams, Myricks returned in 1992 as a 36-year-old to a fifth Olympic Trials, finishing in seventh place. Myricks was the third-place jumper at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics - Men's Long Jump when Lewis and Mike Powell were fighting over the world record, what many consider the greatest long jump competition ever. Based on a statistical comparison of 8.16 meters, Myricks had more competitions (170) over that mark than any other competitor. Moving that comparison to 8.50 m, he ranks second (17) to Carl Lewis (39) (as of 1996; since 1996, only 9 jumpers have jumped 8.50). Myricks' last 8.50 in 1991, at the age of 35, is tied with Lewis' mark from the 1996 Olympics as the M35 Masters World Record. He was also a useful 200 m sprinter, with a best of 20.03 s at the US National Championships in 1983 behind his nemesis Carl Lewis, who along with Mike Powell overshadowed him for most of his career. He ran the 200 at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics. Myricks won the U.S. nationals in the 200 meters in 1988. Myricks is also a graduate of Mississippi College. He was coached there by Joe Walker (now at Ole Miss). Larry Myricks was suspended (May 1990) by the TAC after a positive test for a banned stimulant before the 1990 U.S. Championships. This suspension was extended to a lifetime ban for two subsequent positive tests. He was later reinstated after having served only one year. ==International competitions== { - !colspan=6Representing - 1976 Olympic Games Montreal, Canada 3rd (q) Long jump 7.92 m (q)1 - 1979 World Cup Rome, Italy bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.52 m - 1980 Liberty Bell Classic Philadelphia, United States bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.20 m - 1983 World Championships Helsinki, Finland 34th (h) 200 m 21.74 - 1984 Olympic Games Los Angeles, United States 4th Long jump 8.16 m - 1985 Grand Prix Final Rome, Italy bgcolor=silver2nd Long jump 8.22 m - 1986 Goodwill Games Moscow, Soviet Union bgcolor=silver2nd Long jump 8.41 m - rowspan=41987 World Indoor Championships Indianapolis, United States bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.23 m - Pan American Games Indianapolis, United States bgcolor=silver2nd Long jump 8.58 m (w) - World Championships Rome, Italy bgcolor=cc99663rd Long jump 8.33 m - Grand Prix Final Brussels, Belgium bgcolor=cc99663rd Long jump 8.06 m - 1988 Olympic Games Seoul, South Korea bgcolor=cc99663rd Long jump 8.27 m - rowspan=31989 World Indoor Championships Budapest, Hungary bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.37 m - World Cup Barcelona, Spain bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.29 m - Grand Prix Final Monte Carlo, Monaco bgcolor=gold1st Long jump 8.54 m - rowspan=21991 World Championships Tokyo, Japan bgcolor=cc99663rd Long jump 8.42 m - Grand Prix Final Barcelona, Spain bgcolor=silver2nd Long jump 8.06 m } Notes: *1 Did not start in the final *Also wn the overall Grand Prix long jump title in 1987 (57 points) and 1989 (53 points) ==References== ==External links== * USTAF Profile * Profile Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American male long jumpers Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1987 Pan American Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:People from Clinton, Mississippi Category:Track and field athletes from Mississippi Category:World record holders in masters athletics Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for the United States Category:Mississippi College alumni Category:Doping cases in athletics Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients Category:American masters athletes Category:Goodwill Games medalists in athletics Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships winners ","title":"Larry Myricks"},{"id":"7788673","text":"Adam Eddington III is a major character in three young adult novels by Madeleine L'Engle. A marine biology student, he is the protagonist of The Arm of the Starfish (1965), and a reluctant romantic love interest for Vicky Austin in A Ring of Endless Light (1980), a romantic relationship that continues in Troubling a Star (1994). He is one of three characters to have major appearances in both L'Engle's O'Keefe family series of books and her Austin family series. ==Major traits== Adam is highly intelligent, with a strong aptitude for science, especially marine biology, a field in which Adam's uncle and namesake made a name for himself a generation earlier. Although he describes himself as \\"not a churchgoer\\", he sang in a church choir as a child, and retains a strong moral sense along with a questioning, philosophical nature. Initially somewhat naive, Adam unwisely trusts a beautiful young woman in The Arm of the Starfish, which results in the death of a friend. Because of this, Adam tries unsuccessfully to maintain an emotional distance from Vicky Austin when he meets her the following summer. He appreciates Vicky for her kind, forthright and poetic nature, and the two become close to each other anyway. By the end of his third and final appearance, Adam and Vicky appear to have formed quite a strong and close, lasting romantic relationship. ==Appearances== ===The Arm of the Starfish=== The Arm of the Starfish (1965, ) introduces readers to the character, and establishes much of his early history in its opening pages. A 16-year-old marine biology student, he has recently graduated from high school and plans to attend the University of California, Berkeley the following winter. The son of a physicist who teaches at Columbia University, Adam has been spending his summers with his family in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he has assisted elderly marine biologist \\"Old Doc\\" Didymus \\"ever since I was a kid.\\" It is said that he considered himself \\"worldly\\" due to growing up in New York City, but this changes when Carolyn \\"Kali\\" Cutter exposes him to the wider world. Principled but naive, Adam has trouble determining who can or cannot be trusted in the struggle between the Cutters, the O'Keefes and their respective allies. ===A Ring of Endless Light=== A Ring of Endless Light (1980, ) finds Adam working with dolphins on Seven Bay Island. Here he meets Vicky Austin, and recruits her for his experiments in dolphin communication. Because of his negative experience with Kali Cutter in The Arm of the Starfish (as theorized by John Austin, Vicky's brother), Adam is initially unwilling to think of Vicky as a potential girlfriend, choosing instead to think of her as a \\"child.\\" However, by the end of the book, he has become so close to Vicky that he hears her telepathically \\"call\\" him to the hospital. ===Troubling a Star=== Troubling a Star (1994, ) continues the story of Adam's relationship with Vicky, and also the progress of his education and career in marine biology. He has the opportunity to live and work in Antarctica, where his uncle, Adam Eddington II, worked and died. (In the book, Eddington Point in Antarctica, where LeNoir Station is located, is named after Adam's uncle.) Adam's Great Aunt Serena, widow of Adam Eddington I (a banker) and mother of Adam Eddington II, is introduced. She gives Vicky the trip to Antarctica that drives the story. Adam quotes William Shakespeare (especially from Hamlet) to Vicky in his letters and postcards, trying to obliquely warn her of the same kind of dangers that resulted in his uncle's murder a generation earlier. When Vicky inadvertently runs afoul of soldiers and a drug kingpin from the fictional South American dictatorship of Vespugia, she is stranded on an iceberg, but Adam finds her. ==References== ==External links== * L'Engle's Official Site * IMDB entry for the film of A Ring of Endless Light Category:Madeleine L'Engle characters Category:Fictional scientists Category:Literary characters introduced in 1965 ","title":"Adam Eddington"},{"id":"7788683","text":"The workhouse test was a condition of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.

The northern tips of the islands are part of Ao Phang Nga National Park. ==Religion== Ninety percent of the district's population (2018) of 18,000 are Muslims. The Muslim religion was introduced in the 13th century by Arab traders. == Administration == The district is divided into three sub- districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 18 villages (mubans).

In 1785 the family moved to Karbala (present-day Iraq), where Zeynalabdin Shirvani was admitted to a religious school and studied mostly Islamic subjects as well as Persian, Arabic and Turkic languages (Azerbaijani Turkic, Anatolian Turkish and Turkmen). In 1796, he moved to Baghdad, where he spent a year studying geography, literature, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. At the age of 17, he went on his first journey. By the end of his life he will have travelled over 60,000 kilometres within 37 years. ==Travels== Zeynalabdin Shirvani had keen interest in exploring Asia and almost never visited Europe. He was attached to his homeland and turned down many offers of local lords who were fascinated by his erudition and wanted him to settle on their lands (in Egypt, Turkey, etc.). During his first journey, Shirvani visited what is now Azerbaijan,Russian source describes Shirvani's theories on various place names in Azerbaijan Iraq, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. His second journey included Iran, Oman, Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan (he is considered the last Eurasian to visit the independent Kingdom of Darfur in 1820), Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Levant, and Turkey. Finally, on his third journey he travelled to Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Iraq. In between those journeys, Shirvani also went on several small trips within Iran and Azerbaijan. He wrote reflections on all of his travels in three main worksDetails of Shirvani's main works (in Russian) (all of them in Persian): *Riyadh as-Sayahat (The Flower Garden of Journeys). It consists of two volumes written in 1822 and 1827 respectively. Parts of the book are now kept at the British Museum and the St Petersburg branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Volume I contains brief historical overview of Iran (including a complete list of ancient and medieval royal dynasties, and biographies of Mazdak, Babak and of over 60 poets), as well as detailed geographic material on Iranian Azerbaijan, Armenia, Shirvan, Talysh, Mughan, Khorasan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gilan, Kurdistan, and Fars. Volume II (thought to have been lost but rediscovered in mid-20th century) contains similar information on Central Asia, Turkey, Arabia and India. *Hadaiq as-Sayahat (The Gardens of Journeys) is an alphabetised list of geographic localities (including states, cities and rivers) in the Middle East, and their detailed description. Shirvani worked on this book for 30 years. The copies of Hadaiq as-Sayahat are kept at the British Museum, the Bibliothèque nationale de France and a private library in Iran. *Bustan as-Sayahat (The Flower Bed of Journeys). This book was written in 1832 but was first published 65 years later. In the first three chapters of the book, the author talks about prominent Middle Eastern scholars, literati and clergy. The fourth chapter contains geographic, cultural and ethnographic information on virtually all regions visited by Shirvani. In Bustan as-Sayahat, he also mentioned countries he did not visit (mainly Russia, France, Austria and the United States) but has done research based on written sources of the time, as well as on his discussions with the scholars. At the end of the book, Shirvani introduces an educational program aimed at encouraging wealthy classes to sponsor education for talented youths who came from poor families, and proposed ways of facilitating living conditions for lower classes. The copies of this book are kept in the United Kingdom, Russia, Georgia, and Iran. ==Philosophical & other works== As well as his famous travel works, Shirvani also composed the Kashf ul-Maarif (The Discovery of Enlightenment), a rather philosophical piece of writing. It consists of Shirvani's biography in the preface, his meetings with famous scholars, and their beliefs and theories. The only copy of the book that is known to have survived to our era was discovered by Azerbaijani historian Agamir Guliyev in Kabul in 1973. The book was never published and the manuscript remained at Guliyev's private library. Some scholars believe that Shirvani wrote a biographical reflection on the great Sufi poet Rumi under the pen name Rahmat Ali Shah. The work was not published during Shirvani's lifetime but was later used in the introduction of an 1895 Bombay edition of the Masnavi.Details of the Rumi work (in Russian) It is important to note that Shirvani warned readers that inaccurate statements might have been included in his works as he was often persecuted by Islamic feudals who regarded his books as a \\"threat to the religion\\". In one case, a study on which he had been working for 25 years was stolen from him and burned by Muhammad Qasim of Gumsha. It took Shirvani a long time to partially restore the lost data. ==Family== Shirvani got married in Shiraz in the early 1820s. He had two sons one of whom died early and the other, Husamaddin Ali, followed his fathers footsteps and also became a geographer. In 1838, Shirvani planned a pilgrimage to Mecca but died of an unknown disease on a ship near Jeddah (present-day Saudi Arabia), where he was buried. ==References== Category:1780 births Category:1838 deaths Category:Persian philosophers Category:People from Shamakhi Category:18th-century Iranian people Category:19th-century Iranian people Category:Iranian philosophers Category:Persian-language writers Category:Persian geographers Category:Iranian geographers ","title":"Zeynalabdin Shirvani"},{"id":"7788752","text":"Typhoon Muifa, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Unding, was a strong typhoon during the 2004 Pacific typhoon season. The name Muifa is taken from the ume blossom. The first of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines, a tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Muifa in the early of the 15th when centered east-southeast of Manila, the Philippines. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130 mph (115 knots), still to the east of the Philippines. Unding, as PAGASA named it, made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80 mph (70 knots). The storm briefly lost typhoon strength for a day until it regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea on the 21st. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250 nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. Later that day Muifa turned northward into an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated south-southwest of Bangkok. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4 mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th. The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for. A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged; total damage reached $1.01 billion pesos ($17.96 million 2004 USD). The highest 24-hour rainfall amount reported in Thailand was 251.5 mm at the Prachuap Khiri Khan airport between the afternoon of the 25th and 26th. Floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon killed about 40 people, and 42 more people were reported missing.Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary November 2004 ==Meteorological history== The disturbance that was to become Muifa can be traced back to the afternoon of November 12, when a weak low-pressure system formed over the Western Marianas.::..Typhoon2000.com: Michael Padua's Full Detailed Report on Typhoon MUIFA (UNDING) ..:: It became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into a tropical storm while moving north-northwestward by early November 15, when centered east-southeast of Manila, Philippines. PAGASA assigned the name Unding to the cyclone on the 14th as it passed the 135th meridian. The storm's forward speed suddenly decreased from 28 km/h to 13 km/h when it entered an area of weak steering flow in between a high-pressure ridge in development centered over China and a high-pressure ridge weakening south of Japan. On the 16th, the tropical cyclone started drifting north-northeast. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130 mph (115 knots) with a minimum central pressure of 955 mbar (hPa), still to the east of the Philippines. Muifa made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80 mph (70 knots). The system ambled across the Philippine Archipelago, dropping down to tropical storm intensity on the afternoon of the 20th. Shortly after Unding left the country, on the 22nd,TRMM Tropical Depression MerbokRed Cross Red Crescent - Appeals (Violeta)Over 30 killed as typhoon smashes into Philippines passed over Luzon. Only five days after that, Tropical Depression Winnie hit Luzon. Luzon was hit a third time by Typhoon Nanmadol on December 2. The Philippines being struck by four tropical systems so close together is a very rare event, and also very damaging. On the 21st, Muifa regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea. Now moving west- southwest, early on the 22nd Muifa re-strengthened into a 105 mph (90 knots) typhoon east of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. At this point, it was forecast by the JTWC that Muifa would strike the southern tip of Vietnam with 65 mph (55 knots) sustained winds. From there, it would restrengthen to typhoon strength and pass over Thailand and enter the Indian Ocean, slowly weakening as it heads into the Bay of Bengal.Death toll rises from floods rises to 60 in northern Philippines in wake of Typhoon Muifa This did not happen, though. On the 25th, Tropical Storm Muifa accelerated westward at a 23 mph (21 knots) clip. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250 nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. It was still forecast by the JTWC that the depression would enter the Andaman Sea, though much weaker than it was previously forecast, and later strike India as a 40 mph (35 knots) tropical cyclone.Typhoon Muifa Once again, this did not occur. Later that day, Muifa turned northward instead and entered an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120 nm south-southwest of Bangkok. But according to the Thailand Meteorological Department (TMD) advisories, Tropical Depression Muifa made landfall near Amphoe Ko Pha Ngan, Surat Thani Province at around 1500 UTC on the 25th with winds of 35 mph (30 knots). ==Preparations== Clark Air Base, an American air base on Luzon, had some 70 United States Marines and others evacuated to Okinawa via plane. Almost 3,000 people were stranded in various places in the Philippines because the ferry crossings between Bicol and the central islands of the Philippines were forbidden to any vessel under 1,000 tons during the storm.2004 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report The Vietnamese government issued protective orders asking Petrovietnam, an oil monopoly, to watch over oil drilling facilities. The facilities were also modified to withstand the typhoon. All but a few of the workers were evacuated before the storm came. Boats were also urged to return to shore somewhere else safe.Planet Ark - Typhoon Muifa to Skirt Vietnam's Southern Coast Off-shore fishing also became forbidden.

Much of southern Luzon and other portions of central Philippines received rainfall between 10 and . Catanduanes and extreme southeastern Luzon might have been blanketed in as much as of rain though.EO Natural Hazards: Typhoon Muifa Naga City only received a total of of rainfall, but it was enough to flood some low-lying areas. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4 mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th. The passing of four cyclones in a short period of time as mentioned above caused a great deal of damage. Over 1,400 people either died or were missing, mostly from Winnie. Rainfall from all systems was extremely high. The lowest pressure at Naga City was 986.1 mb early on the 16th. Because of the high rainfall, over 3,000 people had to be evacuated from the lowlands.http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1247867.htm A wind gust of coming from the north was measured in Naga City. The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for. Most of the casualties were adults, but two infants succumbed to hypothermia, as did an elderly man in Catanduanes. Another twelve of those people were killed by a tornado associated with the storm that ripped through the coastal towns in Oriental Mindoro province.Philippines: GMA releases P5 M for typhoon victims in Oriental Mindoro A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged, with 40 of those homes being in Cataduanes.Microsoft Word - DISASTERS_UPDATE38.doc Some areas reported 80% of the trees and electricity posts were destroyed. Total damage in the Philippines reached 1.01 billion pesos ($17.96 million 2004 USD, November 26, 2004 exchange rate). At least fifteen provinces were affected by Unding. ===Vietnam=== Typhoon Muifa had a very devastating impact on Vietnam. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount reported was 251.5 mm at Prachuap Khirikhan between the afternoon of the 25th and 26th. Flooding from the torrential rains was seen in the low-lying places in and around the city of Huế and nearby districts.http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-11/26/Stories/10.htm. Vietnam news The cyclone caused the 14 houses to collapse. An additional 85 home's roofs were blown off in Cà Mau. Approximately 500 square kilometres of paddy rice, shrimp, and fruit trees were annihilated. In the Bạc Liêu Province, 34 houses fell, and another 90 or more were damaged to some degree. Five houses in the Kien Giang province were damaged and three fishing vessels sank off the coast. Hội An, which is the town that was declared a world heritage site, was hit by the flood and submerged in more than 6 feet (2 meters) of water, and more than 83 old houses were in danger of collapse. In all, over 170,000 houses in five provinces were submerged partially.Vietnam flood kills 40 Floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon killed about 40 people, and 42 more people were declared missing. At least three people were injured in the Bạc Liêu Province, while one fisherman was reported missing in Kiên Giang. ==Aftermath== There were many relief operations setup throughout the Philippines very shortly after the cyclone moved into the South China Sea. The Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) also mobilized 15 disaster response teams quickly. All together, there were about 1,000 volunteers helping the evacuation of the disaster-stricken families and in the initial relief operation. Two hundred sacks of rice and vegetables seeds were distributed by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, president of the Philippines, throughout Oriental Mindoro. The Philippine president also released a total of $5 million pesos for cleaning up in Oriental Mindoro on November 25. $3 million pesos went to rebuilding homes in Roxas. The other $2 million pesos went to the provincial government's relief and rehabilitation efforts. A member of the country's congress also gave $10 million pesos to be used for the hoped speedy rehabilitation of the province. Residents that were evacuated in the coastal communities of Vietnam returned home on the morning of November 25. The families whose homes were damaged began to receive emergency relief aid. But there were also many villages in the mountains which needed urgent relief but which could not be quickly reached. ===Retirement=== The name that PAGASA gave to Muifa, Unding, was retired following this storm.

The commission lasted until 1847 when it was replaced by a Poor Law Boardthe Andover workhouse scandal being one of the reasons for this change. Edwin Chadwick, one of the writers of the 1832 Royal Commission hoped to become Commissioner but instead only got the post of Secretary. This caused clashes with the Poor Law Commissioners. This was one reason the Poor Law Commission was eventually abolishedthere was too much infighting within the organisation. ==Powers== The Poor Law Commission was independent of Parliament. This made it vulnerable to criticism from those inside Parliament. In the parishes the commissioners were almost universally hated.Poverty and Public Health 1815-1948 by Rosemary Rees The Commission had the power to issue directives but there was no way to make parishes do what the Commission wanted them to do. The Commission however did have powers over dietaries for the workhouse and it could veto appointments to boards of guardianstherefore making it difficult for the parishes that opposed it. ==Implementation of the Poor Law== Edwin Chadwick, the Secretary to the Poor Law Commission, wanted the New Poor Law to be implemented at first in the north of England where, at that time, there were few economic problems: employment was high and food was plentiful. But the narrow base of the economy posed the problem that unemployment could fluctuate wildly. This made implementation of the Act difficult as it was a physical impossibility to build a workhouse which could hold the large numbers affected by cyclical employment.

Porosity that is not considered \\"effective porosity\\" includes water bound to clay particles (known as bound water) and isolated \\"vuggy\\" porosity (vugs not connected to other pores). The effective porosity is of great importance in considering the suitability of rocks or sediments as oil or gas reservoirs, or as aquifers. The term lacks a single or straightforward definition. Even some of the terms used in its mathematical description (\\"V_{cl}” and “V_{sh}”) have multiple definitions. ==Background for multiple definitions== The components of the gross rock (bulk) volume as a strip. The individual components are not to scale. For example, porosity and pore volume are over-emphasised for illustrative purposes. Adapted from Eslinger and PevearEslinger, E. and Pevear, D. \\"Clay Minerals for Petroleum Geologists and Engineers\\", SEPM Short Course No. 22, 1988. === Quartz=== \\"Quartz\\" (more aptly termed “non-clay minerals”) forms part of the matrix, or in core analysis terms, part of the grain volume. ===Clay layers=== \\"Clay layers\\" are dry clay (Vcl) which also form part of the grain volume. If a core sample is dried in a normal dry oven (non-humidified atmosphere) the clay layers and quartz together form the grain volume, with all other components constituting core analysis “total porosity” (notwithstanding comments in ). This core total porosity will generally be equivalent to the total porosity derived from the density log when representative values for matrix and fluid density are used. The clay layers contain groups (often termed “structural water”). This structural water is never part of the pore volume. However, since neutron logs sense H (hydrogen) and all hydrogen so-sensed is allocated as pore space, then neutron logs will overestimate porosity in argillaceous rocks by sensing as part of the pore space. ===Clay surfaces and interlayers=== “Clay surfaces and interlayers” comprise electrochemically bound water (clay-bound water or CBW) which varies in volume according to the clay-type, and the salinity of the formation water (see the Attachments section). The most common definition of effective porosity for sandstones excludes CBW as part of the porosity, whereas CBW is included as part of the total porosity. Worthington, P.F. “Conjunctive interpretation of core and log data through association of effective and total porosity models” In: Harvey, P.K. & Lovell, M.A. ( eds), Core-LogIntegration, Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 136, 213-223.Adams, S., “Porosity—Total vs Effective”, WellEval.com website, 2005 That is: :\\\\text{Effective porosity} = \\\\text{Total porosity} - \\\\text{CBW} To assess the effective porosity, samples are dried at 40-45% relative humidity and 60 °C. This means that one to two molecular layers of CBW can be retained, and a form of “effective porosity” can be measured on the samples. However, the CBW retained by the humidity-dried core plugs is not necessarily representative of CBW in the formation at reservoir conditions. This lack of reservoir representation occurs not only because CBW tends to a minimum value in cores humidity-dried at the specified conditionsBush, D.C. and Jenkins, R.E., “Proper Hydration of Clays for Rock Property Determination”, SPE 2589, JPT, July 1970, 800-804. but also because the amount of CBW at reservoir conditions varies with the salinity of formation water in the “effective” pore space.

Juhasz, I. “Conversion of routine air permeability data into stressed brine- permeability data” Tenth European Formation Evaluation Symposium, paper Y, 1986. Humidity-dried cores have no water in the “effective” pore space, and therefore can never truly represent the reservoir CBW condition. A further complication can arise in that humidity drying of cores may sometimes leave water of condensation in clay-free micropores. Log derivation of effective porosity includes CBW as part of the volume of shale (Vsh). Vsh is greater than the volume of Vcl not only because it incorporates CBW, but also because Vsh includes clay size (and silt-size) quartz (and other mineral) grains, not just pure clay. ===Small pores=== \\"Small pores” contain capillary water which is different from CBW in that it is physically (not electrochemically) bound to the rock (by capillary forces). Capillary water generally forms part of the effective pore space for both log and core analysis. However, microporous pore space associated with shales (where water is held by capillary forces and hence is not true CBW) is usually estimated as part of the Vsh by logs and therefore not included as part of the effective porosity. The total water associated with shales is more properly termed “shale water” which is larger in value than CBW. If we humidity dried core samples, (some of) the electrochemically bound CBW would be retained, but none of the capillary-bound microporous water (notwithstanding comments in ). Therefore, although the figure infers that a humidity-dried core could produce an effective porosity similar to a log analysis effective porosity, the effective porosity from the core will usually be higher (see “Examples” section)—notwithstanding comments in . Traditionally, true CBW has been directly measured neither on cores nor by logs, although NMR measurement holds promise. At a given height above the free-water level, the capillary water becomes “irreducible”. This capillary water forms the irreducible water saturation (“Swi”) with respect to effective porosity (notwithstanding the inclusion of microporous water as Vsh during the log analysis) whereas for total porosity, the CBW and capillary water combined form the “Swi”. ===Large pores=== ”Large pores” contain hydrocarbons (in a hydrocarbon bearing formation). Above the transition zone, only hydrocarbons will flow. Effective porosity (with reference to the figure below) can be classified as only the hydrocarbon-filled large pore spaces above the transition zone. Anecdotally, effective pore space has been equated to displaceable hydrocarbon pore volume. In this context, if residual hydrocarbon saturation were calculated at 20%, then only 80% of the hydrocarbon-filled pores in the figure would constitute effective pore space. ===Isolated pores=== “Isolated pores” in clastics, and most carbonates, make a negligible contribution to porosity. There are exceptions. In some carbonates, for example, the tests of microscopic organisms can become calcified to create significant isolated intra-particular pore space which is not connected to the inter-particular pore space available for hydrocarbon storage and flow. In such cases, core analysis will only record the inter-particular pore space, or “effective porosity”, whereas the density and neutron logs will record the total pore space. Only by crushing the rock can the core analysis yield the total porosity seen by the logs. The traditional Petroleum Engineering and core analysis definition of effective porosity is the sum of the interconnected pore space—that is, excluding isolated pores. Therefore in practice, for the vast majority of sedimentary rocks, this definition of effective porosity equates to total porosity. ==Summary of terms== Summary of terms using the Eslinger & Pevear concepts ;Total porosity: The volume of the reservoir rock which is fluid (oil, water, gas) filled, expressed as a percentage or a fraction of the gross (bulk) rock volume. ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e1}: The sum of all the interconnected pore space. In the vast majority of cases, this core analysis and Petroleum Engineering definition of effective porosity equates to total porosity. ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e2}: Effective porosity measured on core samples which are dried in a humidity oven so that clays retain one or two molecular layers of bound water—however, this CBW tends to a minimum and is likely not reservoir representative. ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e3}: Total porosity minus clay-bound water (CBW). ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e4}: Log effective porosity. In essence, total porosity minus shale water, where solid minerals and the volume of shale (Vsh) constitute the matrix (non-effective porosity) and the remaining volume constitutes the effective porosity. For practical purposes, Vsh includes solid clays and the clay-sized and silt-sized fraction of non-clay minerals plus CBW and capillary bound water associated with shale micropores. ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e5}: In a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir above the transition zone, only that pore space which is filled with hydrocarbons. From the NMR log, this equates to the Free Fluid Index (FFI), in other words, all pore space above the T2 cut-off. :Effective porosity and micro-porosity determination can be determined from NMR T2 distribution as well from the capillary pressure curve. The cumulative distribution for the fully saturated sample is compared to the cumulative distribution after centrifuging at 100 psi. The cutoff time which separates the T2 distribution into macro-porosity and micro-porosity is defined as the relaxation time at the point where the cumulative porosity of the fully saturated sample equals the irreducible water saturation. ;Effective porosity \\\\phi_{e6}: The volume of pore space which contains only producible hydrocarbons. ;Clay-bound water (CBW): The amount of Clay-bound water is determined by the following equation ::\\\\text{CBW} = \\\\phi_t \\\\cdot \\\\text{SF} \\\\cdot \\\\text{Qv} :where \\\\phi_t is total porosity, \\\\text{SF} is salinity factor :and \\\\text{Qv} is the Cation Exchange Capacity, meq/ml pore space ;Salinity factor (SF): 0.6425 \\\\cdot S^{-0.5} + 0.22 :where S is the salinity in g/l, ==Examples== A dramatic example of a core effective porosity vs log effective porosity discrepancy comes from some Greensand reservoirs in Western Australia. Greensands are green because of iron-bearing glauconite which is usually recognized as illite/mica or mixed layer illite-smectite clay by x-ray diffraction. The glauconite per se will incorporate electrochemically bound water (CBW) because of the clay types. More importantly for the consideration of effective porosity, though, glauconite grains (part of the Vsh) have intra- particular microporous pore space which retains capillary-bound water. Glauconite can constitute a large percentage of the reservoir rock, and therefore the associated intra-particular pore space can be significant. Log effective porosities calculated at 25% in some Greensand reservoirs have yielded core analysis effective porosities of 35% at equivalent depths. The difference is the glauconitic microporosity which contains water at reservoir conditions and is included as part of the Vsh (non-effective porosity) by log analysis. However, glauconitic microporosity is measured as part of the effective porosity in core plugs, even if they are humidity dried. Greensands may cause varying degrees of difficulty for porosity log analysis. radicals affect neutron logs; the iron component is troublesome, and varying clay hydration needs to be considered for density log interpretation. The iron component affects the NMR logs and clay affects the sonic log. Therefore it is essential to have a core - or at least a good understanding of the geology - before invoking total vs effective porosity relationships. ==See also== * Bulk density * Porosity * Gas porosity ==Notes== * Vcl has been expressed as: dry clay; dry clay plus CBW. Vsh has been described as: dry clay plus CBW (one version of a “perfect shale”); dry clay, CBW plus silt (the Dual Water “perfect shale” in the diagram above; dry clay, silt, CBW plus shale microporous water (the “practical shale”). * Different derivations of effective porosity are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Moreover, the unifying underlying theme is interconnected pore space even though unconnected pore space may result from a number of different mechanisms, such as physically isolated pores created by calcified fossils or flow-isolated microporosity. * No matter what definition of porosity is used, the calculated hydrocarbon-in-place should always be the same. For this reason, hydrocarbon- in-place can be expressed as a percentage of the total (gross) rock volume thereby bypassing the issue of porosity altogether. However, since current logging tools cannot directly sense hydrocarbon alone, the intermediate step of porosity calculation is still a basic necessity. ==References== Category:Hydrology ","title":"Effective porosity"},{"id":"7788825","text":"Jedlińsk is a village in Radom County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Jedlińsk. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north of Radom and south of Warsaw along the E77 Highway. The village has an approximate population of 1,700. Jedlińsk gained town privileges in 1530. These were revoked in 1869, while it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Its name comes from pine trees (), which were abundant in the area in the Middle Ages. ==History== Jedlińsk was granted town charter in the year 1530, upon an order of King Sigismund I the Old. At that time, it belonged to the Jedliński family (Nabram coat of arms), and in the second half of the 16th century, Jedlińsk emerged as one of centers of the Protestant Reformation in northern Lesser Poland. The town had a Calvinist prayer house, together with a school, which competed with the famous Racovian Academy (see also Polish Brethren). The school existed in 1560–1630, and in that period, Jedlińsk attracted many Scottish Calvinists, who founded a bell for the prayer house (the bell still exists). In 1630 – 1669, Jedlińsk belonged to the Witowski family, and was part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town was destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and never recovered from the destruction. Furthermore, it changed hands several times in the 18th century, belonging to a number of families. In 1794, Tadeusz Kosciuszko stayed here for a short time, on his way towards Warsaw. After the Partitions of Poland, Jedlińsk shortly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and on June 11, 1809, a battle between Polish Army and the Austrians took place here, during the Polish–Austrian War. In 1815 – 1915, Jedlińsk belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and the Russians stripped it of the town charter in 1869, as a punishment for the January Uprising. In 1890, the village burned in a fire. Jedlińsk has a parish church, which was destroyed by the Swedes in 1655, and remodelled in 1752. In World War II, the Germans occupied Jedlinsk in September 1939. After spring, 1941, Jedlinsk's Jews, numbering around 750 before the war, were confined to a ghetto without reliable access to food. There is some evidence that a local priest allowed them to use the church passageway as a food smuggling point. In July or August 1942, the Jews were rounded up, a number shot on the spot, and the rest transferred to the Bialobrzegi ghetto. A few weeks later, they were deported to the killing camp, Treblinka, where they were immediately gassed. Only a few dozen of Jedlińsk's Jews were thought to have survived the war and Holocaust. ==References== ==External links== * Jewish Community in Jedlińsk on Virtual Shtetl Category:Villages in Radom County Category:Populated places established in 1530 ","title":"Jedlińsk"},{"id":"7788830","text":"The Association of Life-Giving Churches is an association of U.S. churches organized by the New Life Church founded by Ted Haggard.

Once fully grown though they are primarily carnivorous, hunting nocturnally and preying on a variety of organisms. Molluscs (bivalves, gastropods and cephalopods) make up approximately one third of its diet and are its main food source; followed by crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, crabs and shrimp) which make up about 20% of its diet. Other food sources include small fish, sea anemones, sea sponges and algae. M. novaezelandieae hunts by using its powerful chelae to catch, kill, crush and access its prey, then feeds using its mouthparts. Its claws are capable of breaking open the tough shells of molluscs allowing the crab to reach the soft mollusc body inside and feed on it. Its claws allow it to effectively kill other forms of prey such as crustaceans as well.Cresswell, P. (1988). Feeding Ecology of the New Zealand Cancer Crab. (Masters Thesis, University of Canterbury. 1988). == Predators, parasites and diseases == In larval form, Metacarcinus novaezelandieae is preyed upon by various fish species. As an adult, it has several main predators. Sea and shore birds (such as gulls) prey on crabs that expose themselves, often flying them up high and then dropping them to crack the tough crab exoskeleton. Larger fish with strong teeth prey upon these crabs under the water. Humans kill and eat these crabs when gathering food from the coast; as well as indirectly killing them from various industrial, scientific and commercial operations.Cresswell, P. (1988). Feeding Ecology of the New Zealand Cancer Crab. (Masters Thesis, University of Canterbury. 1988). == Cultural uses == New Zealand Maori have historically eaten crabs as part of their kai moana (food from the ocean) diet. Crabs were an easy resource to gather as they are often found in coastal shallows, making them easily accessible sea food. M. novaezelandieae is most likely among the many species of crabs the Maori ate, as it grows to a size large enough to be considered for eating, as well as being found throughout New Zealand. Sea food including M. novaezelandieae are still claimed by Maori today as a cultural food resource.Fisher, K., Vallance, S. (2010).

In all, seven players were found to have participated in the scandal and all were subsequently banned for life, although most later had their bans overturned. ==The match== At the time of the match, Manchester United were struggling to avoid relegation, while Liverpool were in mid-table and neither challenging for honours nor facing the threat of relegation themselves. The effects of the First World War provided further motivation to perpetrate a fix – by the end of March it was almost certain that the league would suspend operations after the 1914–15 season was finished, interrupting and possibly ending the footballing careers of everyone then playing in the league. Also, the players perhaps thought that the diversion of the conflict would lessen the attention that would normally be paid to a dubious match result. The match ended in a 2–0 win to United, with George Anderson scoring both goals. However, the match referee and some observers noted Liverpool's lack of commitment during the game – they had missed a penalty that had been awarded to them, and when Fred Pagnam hit the Manchester United crossbar late in the match, his teammates publicly remonstrated with him. ==Investigation and punishments== After the match, handbills started to appear, alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2–0 win to United. The Football Association launched an investigation and found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West of United, and Jackie Sheldon, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Thomas Fairfoul of Liverpool; Sheldon was a former United player himself and was found to be the plot's ringleader. Some players, such as Pagnam and United's George Anderson, had refused to take part. Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result, hence his late shot against the crossbar; he later testified against his team-mates at the FA hearing. At the same hearing, United player Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but stated that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him. All seven players were banned from playing for life in a decision handed down on 27 December 1915. The FA concluded that it had been a conspiracy by the players alone – no official from either club was found guilty of wrongdoing, and neither club was fined or had points deducted. West vociferously protested his innocence, even going so far as suing the FA for libel. However, he lost the case and the ban stood. In itself, the ban had no immediate effect on the players' footballing careers, as by that point the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the First World War. The ban did not apply in Scotland (four of the suspended players were Scottish), however the Scottish Football Association was never called upon to issue any sort of ruling on the players' eligibility there. Sandy Turnbull was killed while serving in the war, but all the other players, except West, had their bans lifted by the FA in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country; Turnbull received a posthumous reinstatement. The intervention of the First World War meant that the Football League did not resume until 1919–20. This meant that West was the only player involved who was actually unable to play League football due to suspension. Fairfoul also did not return to football although he was re-instated, however the other four players resumed their careers after the war. West had to wait until 1945 for his ban to be lifted, by which time he was 59. ==Consequences== Although the players' main motives for the match-fixing appear to be financial, and not to save United from relegation, the two points United won from that game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety, one point ahead of 19th-placed Chelsea, who were nominally relegated. Before the 1919–20 season started, the League decided to expand the First Division by two teams; Chelsea (along with Arsenal) were elected back into the First Division and thus spared the drop. ==See also== * 1964 British betting scandal, a similar betting scandal nearly 50 years later. * 2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal ==References== * * * ==Further reading== * * Category:1914–15 in English football Category:History of football in England Category:Sports betting scandals Category:Association football controversies Category:Liverpool F.C.

Lemieux, was a Quebec lawyer, judge and political figure. He represented Lévis in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1883 to 1892 and Bonaventure from 1894 to 1897. Lemieux was also Louis Riel's lawyer in 1885. He was born at Lévis in 1851 and studied at the college there, at Quebec City and the Université Laval. He articled in law, was called to the Quebec bar in 1872 and became a successful criminal lawyer. In 1874, he married Diane, the daughter of judge Marc-Aurèle Plamondon. Lemieux was the head of Louis Riel's defence team, which included several other leading lawyers from eastern Canada, at his trial for high treason in 1885. Some believe that Riel's lawyers may not have taken advantage of available options for avoiding the death penalty. The jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy, but the judge sentenced Riel to death. Subsequent appeals of the verdict were dismissed and Riel was executed in November 1885. In 1892, Lemieux successfully defended Honoré Mercier against a charge of having defrauded the public treasury. Lemieux was named bâtonnier for the Quebec bar in Quebec district in 1896 and for the province in 1896 and 1897. Lemieux had been reelected to the legislative assembly in both Lévis and Bonaventure in 1897, but resigned his seat when he was named judge in the Quebec Superior Court for Athabaska district. In 1915, he was named chief judge in the court. He was knighted in 1915.

He scored nine goals in 21 gamesNot including the January 1973 exhibition match \\"Old Europe\\" vs. \\"New Europe\\", which marked the 1973 European Community expansion. Jensen started the game, scored a goal, and was substituted after an hour, as \\"New Europe\\" won 2–0. for the Denmark national football team from 1972 to 1980. ==Biography== Born in Nørresundby, Jensen started playing football for local team Nørresundby BK in the Denmark Series, the then fourth best division of Danish football. Playing as a Right sided Attacker, he made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1972, and scored a goal in the 1972 Summer Olympics qualification match against Romania. Before having ever played a Danish league game, he moved abroad in 1972 as he signed a professional contract with German club Borussia Mönchengladbach. At Mönchengladbach, he played alongside fellow Danish national team player Allan Simonsen in attack. He won the 1972–73 DFB-Pokal, 1974–75 UEFA Cup, and two Bundesliga championships in his four years at the club. After 44 goals in 125 league games, he earned a lucrative move to defending Spanish La Liga champions Real Madrid in 1976. He played three successful years at Real Madrid, winning the 1977–78 and 1978–79 La Liga championships. While in Madrid, he scored the 300th goal in the European competition for the club. He moved to the Netherlands in 1979, to play for defending Dutch Eredivisie champions Ajax Amsterdam of the coaches Cor Brom and Leo Beenhakker. He met in Amsterdam other Danish players like Frank Arnesen and Søren Lerby (and two years later also for a very short period Jesper Olsen). The routined player had to work hard for his position in the team for the first time at the age of 30 years. The midfielder had much rivalry from Frank Arnesen, Dick Schoenaker and Søren Lerby, which trio formed one of the strongest (attacking) midfields of Europe those years. Jensen started as centre forward, when central attacker Ray Clarke was sold. Thereafter he played at the wings, as wing attacker for a period. When Frank Arnesen had been injured a part of the 1979–80 season Jensen moved to the midfield, there playing his best matches for Ajax Amsterdam. In the season 1979–80 he won with Ajax the Dutch Eredivisie league championship and also the semi-finals of the European Cup tournament for champions were reached that season. He returned to Denmark in July 1981, to play for AGF Aarhus, before he moved back to Nørresundby and played his last games for Nørresundby BK. In 2006, Henning Jensen was named among the nominees for DBU's \\"Denmark's All- Time Best Footballer\\" award, alongside Preben Elkjær Larsen, Brian Laudrup, Michael Laudrup, Morten Olsen, Peter Schmeichel, Allan Simonsen and Jon Dahl Tomasson. He died after a short illness from cancer. ==Honours== * DFB-Pokal: 1972–73 * UEFA Cup: 1974–75 * Bundesliga: 1974–75 and 1975–76 * Spanish La Liga: 1977–78 and 1978–79 * Dutch Eredivisie: 1979–80 ==References== ==External links== *Danish national team profile * Category:1949 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Nørresundby BK players Category:Borussia Mönchengladbach players Category:Real Madrid CF players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Aarhus Gymnastikforening players Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Bundesliga players Category:La Liga players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Danish expatriate footballers Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:People from Nørresundby Category:Association football forwards Category:UEFA Cup winning players Category:Deaths from cancer in Denmark ","title":"Henning Jensen"},{"id":"7788894","text":"Robert Schurrer (24 March 1890 – 27 November 1972) was a French sprinter, who competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Indeed, military engineering was in many ways institutionally endemic in Roman military culture, as demonstrated by the fact that each Roman legionary had as part of his equipment a shovel, alongside his gladius (sword) and pila (spears). Fabri were workers, craftsmen or artisans in Roman society and descriptions of early Roman army structure (Phalanx, the Legion came around the conquest of Greece) attributed to king Servius Tullius describe there being two centuriae of fabri under an officer, the praefectus fabrum. Roman military engineering took both routine and extraordinary forms, the former a proactive part of standard military procedure, and the latter of an extraordinary or reactionary nature. ==Proactive and routine military engineering== ===The Roman legionary fortified camp=== Each Roman legion had a military legionary fort as its permanent base. However, when on the march, particularly in enemy territory, the legion would, after a day's marching, construct a fortified camp or castra, requiring as raw materials only earth, turf and timber. Camp construction was the responsibility of special engineering units to which specialists of many types belonged, officered by architecti (engineers), from a class of troops known as immunes since they were excused from or, literally, immune from, regular duties. These engineers would requisition manual labor from the soldiers at large as required. A legion could throw up a camp under enemy attack in as little as a few hours. Judging from the names, they probably used a repertory of camp plans from a set textbook, selecting the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: tertia castra, quarta castra: \\"a camp of three days\\", \\"four days\\", etc. ===Bridge building=== Trajan's Bridge across the Danube, the longest bridge for over a millennium Roman Legionaries crossing the Danube River by pontoon bridge during the Marcomannic Wars, as depicted in relief on the column of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161-180 AD) in Rome, Italy The engineers also built bridges from both timber and stone depending on required permanence, time available etc. Some Roman stone bridges survive to this day. Stone bridges were made possible by the innovative use of the keystone to allow an arch construction. One of the most notable examples of military bridge-building in the Roman Empire was Julius Caesar's Bridge over the Rhine River. This bridge was completed in only ten days and is conservatively estimated to have been more than 100 m (300 feet) long.Nebel, B. Julius Cäsars Brücke über den RheinVoggenreiter, A., Historischer Rückblick The construction was deliberately over-engineered for Caesar's stated purpose of impressing the Germanic tribes,Caesar writes in his War in Gaul that he rejected the idea of simply crossing in boats because it \\"would not be fitting for my own prestige and that of Rome\\" - at the time, he did not know that the Germanic tribes had already in fact withdrawn from the area upon his arrival who had little experience of engineering, and to emphasise that Rome could travel wherever she wished. Caesar was able to cross over the completed bridge and explore the area uncontested, before crossing back over and dismantling the bridge. Caesar relates in his War in Gaul that he \\"sent messengers to the Sugambri to demand the surrender of those who had made war on me and on Gaul, they replied that the Rhine was the limit of Roman power\\". The bridge was intended to show otherwise. ===Engineering siege machines=== Roman carroballista on Trajan's Column, early 2nd century AD Although most Roman siege engines were adaptations from earlier Greek designs, the Romans were adept at engineering them swiftly and efficiently, as well as innovating variations such as the repeating ballista. The 1st century BC army engineer Vitruvius describes in detail many of the Roman siege machines in his manuscript De Architectura. ===Road making=== When invading enemy territories, the Roman army would often construct roads as they went, to allow swift reinforcement and resupply, as well as a path for easy retreat if necessary. Roman road-making skills are such that some Roman roads survive to this day. Michael Grant credits the Roman building of the Via Appia with winning them the Second Samnite War.Michael Grant, The History of Rome, p. 52 ===Civilian engineering by military troops=== Greco-Roman Pentaspastos (\\"Five-pulley- crane\\"), a medium-sized variant (ca. 450 kg load) The Roman army also took part in building projects for civilian use. There were sound reasons for the use of the army in building projects: primarily, that if they weren't directly engaged in military campaigns, the legions were largely unproductive, costing the Roman state large sums of money. But the involvement of the soldiers in building works, kept them not only well accustomed to hard physical labour, but also kept them busy, since it was the widely held belief that busy armies weren't plotting to mutiny, whereas idle armies were. Of both military and civilian use was the construction of roads within the boundaries of the Empire, in which the army was heavily involved. But so too were soldiers put to use in the construction of town walls, the digging of shipping canals, the drainage of land, aqueducts, harbours, even in the cultivation of vineyards. In some rare cases soldiers were even used in mining work. ===Mining operations=== They were also skilled in conducting mining operations such as building the many aqueducts needed for prospecting for metal veins, in methods like hydraulic mining, and the building of reservoirs to hold the water at the minehead. It is likely that they were also capable of building and operating mine equipment such as water mills, stamp mills and dewatering machines. It is likely that they were closely involved in exploiting gold resources such as those at Dolaucothi in south west Wales. It was developed soon after conquest of the region under Frontinus, and the local auxiliary troop came from north- west Spain, a country where gold mining developed on a very large scale in the early part of the first century AD. ==Reactive and extraordinary engineering== The knowledge and experience learned through such routine engineering lent itself readily to any extraordinary engineering foot projects required by the army, and it is here that the scale of Roman military engineering exceeded that of any of its contemporaries in both imagination and scope. One of the most famous of such extraordinary constructions was the circumvallation of the entire city of Alesia and its Celtic leader Vercingetorix, within a massive length of double-wall – one inward-facing to prevent escape or offensive sallies from the city, and one outward-facing to prevent attack by Celtic reinforcements. This wall is estimated to have been over long. A second example would be the massive ramp built using thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth up to the invested city of Masada in the Jewish Revolt. The siege works and the ramp remain in a remarkable state of preservation today. ==See also== * Technological history of the Roman military *List of Roman Pontoon bridges *Roman architecture *Roman aqueducts *Roman engineering *Trajan's column ==Notes== ==External links== * Traianus - Technical investigation of Roman public works Category:Military engineering ","title":"Roman military engineering"},{"id":"7788965","text":"Dualit is a British manufacturer of coffee and tea capsules, kitchen and catering equipment and is best known for its range of heavy-duty toasters. The Dualit Classic Toaster is regarded as a design classic. Although it was primarily designed for the commercial catering market, it became trendy in the 1990s as a domestic product and was described by Bill Deedes in The Observer newspaper as a \\"symbol of the kitchen porn 90s\\". == Origins == Dualit was founded in 1945 by the German-born inventor Max Gort-Barten CBE (1914–2003) and was incorporated as Dualit Ltd in 1948. Max's first commercial product was an electric heater which he named Dual-Lite (from which the company took its name) as it could deflect heat to two parts of a room. In 1952 Max designed a commercial six-slot toaster with a manual eject lever in his factory in Camberwell, south east London. In 1954 the Government compulsory-purchased the factory and gave Max money to build a new factory in Bermondsey, just off the Old Kent Road. Other products followed and demand exploded. Eventually, their London base proved too small for them and in 2003 the company moved to its present site in Crawley, West Sussex.The Telegraph September 5th, 2014 They currently occupy 5,570m² (60,000sq foot) with further expansion planned.Crawley Borough Council Max's son Leslie joined the company in 1972 and is now managing director. Leslie is a trained engineer and worked making metal press tools before joining Dualit. Leslie's son Alex is now a company director, having trained in product design. Before coming to Dualit, he worked as a product designer in both London and Hong Kong. == The Classic Toaster == The Dualit Classic Toaster has been described as a design icon.Phaidon Design Classics: Volume 1, No.319, published by Phaidon Press, May 2006 It differs from other toasters on the market in two key ways: Firstly, it has Dualit’s patented ProHeat elements that have an armour-plated design to protect them from damage. Secondly, the hand-built process used in their manufacture, with each part held together with visible screws, makes the toaster robust, yet easy to disassemble and repair, with replacement elements and other parts readily available so it typically has a longer service life than contemporary electronically controlled toasters. It has a mechanical timer and manual lever to lift the toast from the slots, as opposed to an auto \\"pop-up\\" mechanism. Designed in 1952 it is notable for its \\"large loaf\\" shape, characterised with cooling slots at both ends of the unit designed to allow it to function for periods of extended use in commercial environments such as a café or canteen. The toasters are currently available in different sizes, with various slot numbers and are manufactured in a range of colours and finishes. Since its creation, it has offered upwards of 50 hues. Among the most recent colours to launch was a copper toaster in 2014, launched alongside a new range of Classic Kettles that also offered a copper option.Dualit unveils new Classic Kettle with changeable element Trusted Reviews, 3 July 2014 The Classic Toaster is still hand built at Dualit's factory in Crawley, West Sussex. == Mica and the ProHeat element == Since Max Gort-Barten's first commercial toaster in 1952, Dualit's toaster elements have been made using a heating wire wound repeatedly around a Mica supporting substrate. Mica is a naturally occurring silicate compound. It is completely inert and also can be naturally separated into flat sheets a lot like slate. As a result, it is readily suited to the manufacture of heating elements. Mica varies in grade – the clearer the Mica, the less impurities it contains. Dualit engineer their elements out of the highest grade Mica which is critical for the performance of the toaster; if there are no impurities then there are no hotspots where the heat conducting wire comes into contact with the supporting silicate substrate. Hotspots diminish longevity and cause uneven toasting. Despite this, the Dualit elements could still be damaged by consumers sticking knives and other implements into the toaster slots and damaging them. Dualit worked on a solution to this and in 1999 patented the ProHeat element, which won the company a Millennium Award.The Big Book It is similar to previous Dualit elements but has two differences; the first is that it has more \\"winds per square centimetre\\" – the heating wire was wound around the mica substrate a greater number of times resulting in much improved toasting ability. The second and most crucial difference is the entire element is coated in a very thin, protective layer of mica, which allows the heat to escape but blocks injurious ingress from the knife. ProHeat elements are currently fitted to every Dualit Classic Toaster, with replacement elements available to be purchased if required. == Expanding the range == In the 1960s, Dualit began to develop different products to add to its portfolio. Still manufacturing for the commercial market, this began with the introduction of a waffle iron and continued to include sandwich toasters, soup kettles and cocktail shakers. The 1970s saw Dualit Toasters start to become more popular in domestic kitchens, but it wasn't until the 1980s that demand in this area soared. Dualit diversified its product range to include kitchen appliances such as blenders, juicers and non-kitchen products like pedestal fans and hand dryers. Dualit still produce a comprehensive range of catering products, together with several toaster and kettle collections, a food preparation range and coffee and tea machines. Their latest development has been producing their own range of beverage capsules for coffee machines.Rivals eye Nestle's captive market, Financial Times, 11 March 2012 == Coffee and tea capsules == Launched in 2012, Dualit's first range of coffee capsules was branded NX Coffee Caps. The patented capsules were designed to be compatible with Nestle's Nespresso coffee capsule machine range as well as Dualit's own coffee machines. The capsules could be purchased from various high street stores as well as ordered off the Dualit website. This was in contrast to the Nespresso system; Nespresso capsules could only be purchased through the website or its own \\"boutiques\\". Nespresso opens up new technical specs to its rivals, The Grocer, 8 February 2014 Nestle sued Dualit in 2013 in an attempt to block production of the compatible capsules claiming patent infringement, but the court awarded in favour of Dualit. Dualit wins battle over Nespresso patent, FT, 24 April 2013 Dualit currently sells two coffee capsule ranges: NX coffee capsules and compostable coffee capsules. The compostable coffee capsules are two single origin coffees, sourced from a single geographic location and grown by groups of small farms. All parts of the packaging can be industrially composted, \\"Independent, May 26th 2017\\" and need to be discarded in local collection scheme food waste bins for this to happen. In 2014, Dualit launched a range of multi-patented tea capsules.

It is common in the arid regions of western North America, especially the Great Basin. From sagebrush steppes to pinyon-juniper woodlands and ponderosa pine forests, this flycatcher forages for insects from shrubs or low tree branches. The American gray flycatcher is one of the many species in the genus Empidonax. These species are very similar in appearance and behavior, and they are notoriously difficult to differentiate. The best characteristics for distinguishing these species are voice, breeding habitat, and range. The American gray flycatcher, however, can be identified by a unique behavior, its downward tail wag. Other Empidonax species typically exhibit a rapid upward tail flick. ==Description== left American gray flycatchers are small birds, but larger than most Empidonax flycatchers. A typical adult measures in length, in wingspan, and in mass. Adults have pale gray upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with a faint olive tinge after molting in fall. Underparts are whitish, but washed slightly with yellow in fresh plumage. They have white wing bars and an inconspicuous white eye ring. There is a pale supraloral band stretching above the base of the bill. Relative to other North American Empidonax flycatchers, the American gray flycatcher has a long, narrow bill, a long tail, and the mandible tends to be paler for more of its length. Juveniles are similar in appearance to adults, but with stronger olive and yellow tones. Also, young birds have buffy wing bars and brownish breasts. Only the male sings. The song is a strong, two syllable note described as chuwip or wilip. A weaker, higher-pitched teeap or seep is often inserted into the song. Both sexes give a dry pit or wit call. Females call often when foraging or collecting nest materials.Sterling, John C. 1999. Gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology ==Taxonomy== The American gray flycatcher is very similar morphologically to the American dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), which has been problematic in taxonomy. When described as a species in 1889, the American gray flycatcher was named Empidonax griseus. This name was reduced to synonymy when it was discovered that the type specimen designated for the dusky flycatcher was in fact an American gray flycatcher. The name then in use for dusky flycatcher was Wright's flycatcher (E. wrightii), a name proposed in 1858. Because the name wrightii took precedence, it was applied to the American gray flycatcher, leaving the dusky flycatcher to be given a new name, E. oberholseri. There are no recognized subspecies, and there is no geographic variation reported. The IOC World Bird List uses the name American grey flycatcher for Empidonax wrightii to differentiate it from the African grey flycatcher. However, the American Ornithological Society (which covers North and Middle America) names it gray flycatcher. ==Distribution== The American gray flycatcher breeds from southernmost British Columbia through a narrow zone in central Washington to eastern Oregon and California. The range extends east across Nevada, southern Idaho, Utah, and northern Arizona to southwestern Wyoming, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. Depending on latitude, they arrive on breeding grounds mid-April to mid-May and leave between mid-August and mid-September. Migration between breeding and wintering grounds takes approximately seven weeks in both spring and autumn. Males usually arrive on breeding grounds one week prior to arrival of females. The American gray flycatcher winters in Baja California Sur, southeastern Arizona, and central Sonora to central Oaxaca. Small numbers may winter in western Texas and southern California. ==Habitat== Breeding habitat can be shrubland, open woodland, or forest with bare understory. Although it is typically dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia species), common associations include bitterbrush (Purshia species), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus species, Ericameria nauseosus), mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), juniper (Juniperus species), pinyon pine (Pinus species), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). During migration habitat is generally similar to breeding habitat, but riparian areas are often used. Thus, migrants may be found in willow (Salix species), oak (Quercus species), or mesquite (Prosopis species). In winter the American gray flycatcher is found in \\"arid open and semiopen areas with scrub and scattered trees\\". ==Behavior== ===Diet=== The diet presumably consists entirely of insects and other small invertebrates. Fruit may be eaten in winter, but that has not been confirmed. Most prey is taken in flight or from the ground. A bird will wait on an open perch – usually on a shrub or low tree branch – and fly out to catch a passing insect. Less commonly, a hovering bird gleans prey from foliage or bark. ===Reproduction=== The American gray flycatcher is territorial during the breeding season. Males establish a territory and attract a female through vocalizations and displays. They appear to be monogamous, but extra-pair copulations may occur. The nest is bulky and less compact than those of other Empidonax flycatchers. The female builds the nest (males rarely help) from various plant materials, especially grass stalks and strips of bark. The nest is usually lined with softer materials, such as wool, hair, feathers, or soft grasses. Nests may be placed in sagebrush, bitterbrush, junipers, or pines. Nest height depends in part on the height of the substrate (i.e., nests tend to be higher in taller trees) but is usually above ground. Most nests are placed in the crotch of a branch next to the trunk, but some are situated on larger branches away from the trunk. Females lay one egg per day, with a final clutch size of three or four. The female incubates the eggs for about two weeks. The eggs, although laid on different days, usually hatch on the same day. The chicks are altricial and have little down when they hatch. Both parents feed the nestlings. Fledging occurs about 16 days after hatching. ==References== ==External links== *Photo gallery - VIREO Photo-High Res--(Close-up) American gray flycatcher Category:Native birds of the Western United States Category:Birds of the Great Basin American gray flycatcher ","title":"American gray flycatcher"},{"id":"7788979","text":"North Shropshire College is a further education college in Shropshire, England and is part of Herefordshire, Ludlow and North Shropshire College.

In 1958 it moved to a site in College Road, and became the Oswestry College of Further Education. In 1978 Oswestry Tertiary College was created during the Tertiary re-organization. It was renamed The North Shropshire College in 1991. It had three main campuses: College Road and Upper Brook Street in Oswestry, and Talbot Campus in Whitchurch. It signed a federated college agreement with Staffordshire University in 1997. At this time the college had a trading subsidiary called 'Mereside' to deal with the College's work with companies and a range of government-sponsored programmes; including coordinating communication for the government's \\"New Deal\\" initiative for the colleges in Shropshire. Oswestry Campus was upgraded in a multi-million pound refit. The Technology block was replaced by a new three story block, and an extra floor was added to the main block. A new £1.3 million Business and IT Centre. including a major upgrade to the teaching kitchen and basic skills area was completed for the start of the autumn term 2008.

From 1908 to 1911, Lenz studied under Arnold Sommerfeld, at the University of Munich, and he was granted his doctorateLenz – Mathematics Genealogy Project. 1911 Dissertation title: Über das elektromagnetische Wechselfeld der Spulen und deren Wechselstrom-Widerstand, Selbstinduktion und Kapazität. on March 2, 1911. Upon graduation, he stayed on at the University, became Sommerfeld’s assistant on April 1, 1911, and he completed his Habilitation on February 20, 1914, becoming a Privatdozent on April 4, 1914. During World War I, he served as a radio operator in France and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class in 1916. From September 30, 1920, he was again an assistant to Sommerfeld at the University of Munich’s Institute of Theoretical Physics, and he was appointed to the title and rank of extraordinarius professor at the University, on November 11, 1920. On December 1, 1920 he became an extraordinarius professor at the University of Rostock. From 1921, until his retirement in 1956, he was at the University of Hamburg, as Ordinarius Professor of Theoretical Physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics.Mehra, Volume 1, Part 1, p. 334.Author Catalog: Lenz – American Philosophical SocietyLenz – ETH ZurichLenz Biography – Litten The formation of the new chair and institute for theoretical physics at Hamburg was a result of advances being made in Germany on atomic physics and quantum mechanics and the personal intervention of Sommerfeld, who helped many of his students get such professorships.Other examples besides Lenz at Hamburg, include Peter Debye at the University of Zurich, Adolf Kratzer at the University of Münster, and Erwin Fues at the University of Stuttgart, where Sommerfeld’s former student Paul Peter Ewald was already in place. When they were called to other facilities, these personnel effectively became extensions of Sommerfeld’s Institute of Theoretical Physics. See Mehra, Volume 1, Part 1, 1982, p. 335 and Mehra, Volume 5, Part 1, 2001, p. 249. At Hamburg, Lenz trained Ernst Ising and J. Hans D. Jensen; his assistants there included Wolfgang PauliPauli began as Hilfsassistent to Lenz at Hamburg on April 1, 1922. He also completed his Habilitation there. Both Lenz and Otto Stern knew of Pauli’s abilities. The mathematician Erich Hecke was dean of the faculty at the time. Hecke waived the normal trail lecture and the colloquium for Habilitation, in recognition of his abilities. The \\"venia legendi\\" was conferred on Pauli and he gave his inaugural lecture on February 23, 1924. See Mehra, Volume 1, Part 2, pp. 487 and 672.

See Unsöld – Mathematics Genealogy Project. Together with Pauli and Otto Stern, Lenz built up the Institute into an international center for nuclear physics. They maintained close scientific and personal exchanges with the institutes for theoretical physics at the Universities in Munich (Sommerfeld), Göttingen (Max Born), and Copenhagen (Niels Bohr).

The comment was regarding the prohibition of Mut'ah, a word with several meanings. It is used in both Nikah mut'ah and Mut'ah of Hajj. Although the narration is prominently quoted and referred to, it is not given any formal name, in contrast to other hadith such as the Hadith of the pond of Khumm or the Hadith of Qur'an and Sunnah ==Narration== A hadith in Sahih Bukhari states: Another hadith under the topic of Hajj states: The hadith recorded from him in Sahih Muslim states: Another recorded by Sahih Muslim states: ==Muslim view== Muslims view this hadith as notable since it can be seen as related to the Hadiths regarding the legality of Nikah Mut'ah, and is often mentioned when discussing those topics. The comment of Imran ibn Husain is regarding the Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah. All Muslims agree that this hadith is authentic, and that Umar did indeed forbid Mut'ah. However, there is dispute on how to define \\"Mut'ah\\" and whether or not it was forbidden before Umar. The hadith tells about a \\"Verse of Mut'ah\\" revealed in the Qur'an. Muslims disagree which verse is alluded to, since two different verses can be seen as the Verse of Mut'ah. *The first one is found in Sura An-Nisa, verse 24. We read: The word \\"istamta´tum\\" is notable, because the word used literally means \\"to benefit, to enjoy, to profit\\".http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mtE#(4:24:23) Muslims differ on what is meant by Mut'ah here, and which judgement the verse gives about it. Generally, Shi'a Muslims tend to believe that Mut'ah here refers to the temporary marriage, and that this verse permits it.As stated by Ayatollah Mahdi Pooya is his tafsir book Holy Quran, on commentary of verse 4:24. This tafsir is available online at Al-Islam.org Among the Sunnis, different view exists: #Some sunnis do not believe that this verse refers to the Nikah Mut'ah at all. This view was favored by Suyuti.Tafsir al-Jalalayn, on commentary of verse 4:24 #Some agree that the verse refers to the temporary marriage, but disagree that the verse permits it. Ibn Kathir cited the hadith from Mujahid ibn Jabr to this effect.Tafsir Al-Quran al-'Adheem, on commentary of verse 4:24 *The second possibility is that \\"The Verse of Mut'ah\\" refers to Al- Baqarah, 196. We read: The phrase \\"...whoever profits by combining the visit with the pilgrimage\\" is notable, because the Arabic word used here is tamattu\`, which literally means \\"to do Mut'ah\\". All Muslims agree that this verse refers to the Mut'ah of Hajj.Among the Shi'a sources who accepts this position is tafsir of Al-Kashani (commentary on 2:196), the tafsir of Pooya and M.A. Ali (commentary on 2:196)Among the Sunni sources who accepts this position is the Tanwir al-Miqbas (under commentary of verse 2:196) and the Tafsir ibn Kathir (under commentary of verse 2:196) ===Sunni view=== Sunnis considered this hadith as Sahih and it is found in the first and second of their Six major Hadith collections, the Two Sahihs, both believed by Sunnis to contain only authentic hadith (Arabic: sahih). In both of them, it is included among the chapters of the Hajj related subjects. comments in his Book Sahih Muslim: A Sunni tafsir includes: Some Sunni commentators of hadith have put Imran ibn Husain among the Salaf in favor of Nikah Mut'ah after Muhammad, based on this narration.Ibn Hazm in Al-Muhalla, chapter of marriage However, the major Sunni opinion is that this hadith actually refers to the Mut'ah of Hajj. Sunni Muslims believe that this view is strengthened by the fact that in both Sahih's, the hadith is included under Hajj-related topics. , the author of the commentary of Sahih Muslim supports the view that this hadith concerning Mut'ah refers to the Mut'ah of Hajj.Al Minhaj bi Sharh Sahih Muslim wrote on his commentary of Al-Baqara, 196: Ibn Kathir thus believed that \\"The verse of Mut'ah\\" mentioned in the hadith refers to Al-Baqara, 196. The same view was held by Fath al-Bari and Ibn al-Jawzi.Kashf al-Mushkil min hadith al-Saheeh (p.449) ===Shi'a view=== Shi'a view this hadith as notable and important on several accounts, and often include it when discussing the hadith that related to Nikah Mut'ah. They view that this verse confirms that Umar prohibited Nikah Mut'ah, and that the reason the Sahaba were not more vocal in their rejection of Umar's verdict () was due to fear of life. This, in turn, is line with the Shi'a notion of Umar being responsible for a military Coup d'état during the Succession to Muhammad. Shi'a notice the Sahaba Imran ibn Husain waited till his dying state before passing on what he knew of the subject, and in fact insisted that the one receiving the information would not pass it on in case he survived. Shi'a also complain about the Sunni translator Muhammad Muhsin Khan translating the Arabic word \\"Mut'ah\\" that appears in the original text into English Mut'ah of Hajj, making it impossible to interpretation as Nikah Mut'ah. Shi'a view that what is called \\"Verse of Mut'ah\\" is a reference to an-Nisa, 24. ==References== ==See also== *List of hadith Category:Nikah mut‘ah Category:Hadith ","title":"Hadith of Mut'ah and Imran ibn Husain"},{"id":"7789051","text":"Euthalia (from Ancient Greek: Euthalia Ευθαλια \\"flower\\", \\"bloom\\") is a genus of brush-footed butterflies.

In the episode, filmmaker Declan Desmond (Eric Idle) returns to Springfield to film the continuation of his documentary series Growing Up Springfield, which chronicles the lives of several Springfield residents. He visits the town with a film crew every eight years to see how the lives of these people have changed, a plot which parodies Up Series in Britain. \\"Springfield Up\\" has received generally positive reviews from critics. ==Plot== Eccentric documentary filmmaker Declan Desmond offers an inside look at his docmuentary, Growing Up Springfield. His film follows the lives of several Springfield residents, returning to them after eight-year intervals to examine how their lives have changed. Particularly featured is Homer, who had wanted to be rich as a child, started a family as an adult, and now lives in an enormous mansion. He explains that he became a success after creating a pen that dispenses condiments. As Desmond is interviewing Marge, Mr. Burns arrives, explaining the mansion as his summer home, which he did not give them permission to use. He has Smithers release attack dogs on the family, chasing them away. Desmond follows Homer, who fears that he now looks like a failure in the documentary. Marge talks to Desmond and convinces him that Homer truly is a successful person. Feeling sorry for Homer, Desmond produces a compilation of people saying good things about him. When Homer watches it, he realizes that spending time with his family and friends has made him happy. ==Production== Eric Idle reprised his role as Decland Desmond The episode was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Chuck Sheetz. It is based on Michael Apted's Up Series, a British documentary series that has followed the lives of fourteen British children since 1964, when they were seven years old, and returns every seven years to document their lives since. English comedian Eric Idle guest starred in the episode as the documentary maker Declan Desmond.

Jokes and gags came fast and furious, all while telling a great story in a cleverly unconventional way,\\" and added that \\"At its core, 'Springfield Up' was a simple story about Homer feeling the need to impress the snooty British documentarian, but then realizing his life wasn't as bad as he thought. It's a tale we've seen on The Simpsons time and again, but the fresh twist of having it presented within Desmond's documentary made it very memorable.\\" TV Squad's Adam Finley wrote: \\"I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it — for the most part, this week's episode was 'just okay' in my opinion. It was nice to see Eric Idle return [...], but the episode felt like two different episodes battling for the same thirty-minute space. [...] In this episode we spend a lot of time learning about those who grew up in Springfield, but Homer's story is also wedged into the mix — it seems the episode should have just been about Homer feeling depressed about his life, or a lighter episode focusing on all the resident of Springfield.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 25, 2007. It was written by J. Stewart Burns, directed by Matthew Nastuk, and guest starred J.K. Simmons as the tabloid editor, Betty White as herself, and Jon Lovitz as Enrico Irritazio. The full-length opening sequence and couch gag ran for over 2 minutes and 20 seconds, making it one of the longest in the history of the show. ==Plot== After failing to blow out all the candles on his birthday cake, an exhausted Homer falls asleep, igniting his party hat on the flames. The burning house is saved by the Springfield fire department, and Marge purchases a fire-proof safe to protect the family's valuables as a precaution. Each family member places one item in the safe, but after it is closed, the items combine to start a fire that destroys both them and the safe. Refusing to accept the loss of all their memories, Marge decides to restage all of the family photos. One shot captures a celebrity sex scandal (Duffman dating Boobarella, despite Duffman being in a committed relationship with a homosexual man) and allows the Simpsons to strike tabloid gold. Tasting success and seeing money to be made, Homer takes to the streets as one of the paparazzi. Overnight, Homer becomes Springfield's most valued tabloid photographer, provoking several local celebrities to commit embarrassing or criminal acts and then snapping pictures of them. After he gate-crashes Rainier Wolfcastle and Maria Shriver Kennedy Quimby's wedding, the celebrities turn the tables on him by hiring top paparazzo Enrico Irritazio to get photos of Homer on his worst behavior (showering at a fire hydrant, letting Maggie drive while trying to beat up Enrico, and burning a jury duty card). Seeing these photos in the tabloids prompts Homer to give up the paparazzi business temporarily, but Lenny and Carl persuade him to resume his work, using a camera that Moe had hidden in the ladies' room of his tavern. Immediately after Moe gives Homer the camera, two women enter the bar and ask to use the restroom so they can trade bras and panties, infuriating Moe since he's no longer have the camera to spy on them. Homer bursts in on the celebrities at their favorite nightclub and takes many compromising photos (of which include Sideshow Mel eating the American flag, Paris Texan making out with Milhouse, Drederick Tatum snorting the ashes of Secretariat like cocaine, and Mayor Quimby and Kent Brockman dressed in sexual costumes and roleplaying). Wolfcastle, resigned to having everyone's outrageous acts exposed, asks Homer what he plans to do with the pictures. Homer says that he will not make them public, as long as the celebrities start treating their fans with more respect and stop taking them for granted. Wolfcastle agrees and, in a show of good faith, invites the Simpsons to a barbecue at an offshore \\"party platform\\" he owns. Here, Marge shows Wolfcastle a screenplay she has written; he quickly flips through it and turns it down. Not long after the party, though, she and Homer find that Wolfcastle has stolen the idea and turned it into a movie, which is now playing at a local theater. Marge does not mind the idea theft, because, in the end, the movie got made. ==Casting== This episode marks the return of several guest stars; it is the ninth appearance of Jon Lovitz and the second of J. K. Simmons and Betty White. J. K. Simmons had previously guest-starred in \\"Moe'N'a Lisa\\", playing another editor. In both episodes his character was a parody of his J. Jonah Jameson character from the Spider-Man films, though the one in this episode does not bear any physical resemblance to Jameson. ==Couch gag== This episode's couch gag, often known as \\"The Homer Evolution\\" by Internet fans, is the longest Simpsons couch gag to date, running one minute and 30 seconds (this, added with the full opening, made the entire opening run for two minutes and 20 seconds). This is much longer than the typical theme song, which runs one minute and 20 seconds. This couch gag was repeated on the season 19 episode \\"The Homer of Seville\\", but instead of Marge saying \\"What took you so long?\\" after Homer comes home, she says \\"Did you bring the milk?\\". Another season 19 episode, \\"Mona Leaves-a\\", has the original line, \\"What took you so long?\\". == Reception == Robert Canning praised this episode, calling it clever, ingenious, and one of the most memorable of the season. The episode scored a 9.0 on TV.com, an equivalent to a \\"superb\\" rating. The episode was referenced in the 2010 documentary, Teenage Paparazzo, directed by Adrian Grenier. ==References== ==External links== * *\\"Homerazzi\\" at TV.com Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Evolution in popular culture ","title":"Homerazzi"},{"id":"7789076","text":"Donagh MacDonagh (22 November 1912 – 1 January 1968) was an Irish writer, judge, presenter, broadcaster, and playwright. ==Personal life== MacDonagh was born in Dublin on St Cecilia's Day in 1912. He was still a young child when his father Thomas MacDonagh, an Irish nationalist and poet, was executed in 1916. Tragedy struck again when his mother, Muriel Gifford, died of a heart attack a year afterwards while swimming at Skerries to Lambay, County Dublin on 9 July 1917. The two children were then taken care of by their maternal aunts, in particular Catherine Wilson. His parents' families then engaged in a series of custody lawsuits, as the MacDonaghs were Roman Catholic and the Giffords were Protestant; in the climate of Ne Temere, the MacDonaghs were successful. NLI MacDonagh archives notes, p.6 He and his sister Barbara (who later married actor Liam Redmond) lived briefly with their paternal aunt Eleanor Bingham, County Clare before being put into the custody of strangers until their late teens, when they were taken in by Jack MacDonagh. He was married twice, to Maura Smyth and, following her death after she drowned in a bath whilst having an epileptic seizure, to her sister, Nuala Smyth. He had four children, Iseult and Breifne by Maura, and Niall and Barbara by Nuala. He died on 1 January 1968 and is buried at Deans Grange Cemetery. ==Legal career== MacDonagh was educated at Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD) with contemporaries Cyril Cusack, Denis Devlin, Charlie Donnelly, Brian O'Nolan, Niall Sheridan and Mervyn Wall. In 1935 he was called to the Bar and practised on the Western Circuit. In 1941 he was appointed a District Justice in County Mayo. To date, he remains the youngest person appointed as a judge in Ireland. He was Justice for the Dublin Metropolitan Courts at the time of his death. ==Writing== He published three volumes of poetry: \\"Veterans and Other Poems\\" (1941), The Hungry Grass (1947) and A Warning to Conquerors (1968). He also edited the Oxford Book of Irish Verse (1958) with Lennox Robinson. He also wrote poetic dramas and ballad operas. One play, Happy As Larry, was translated into a number of languages. He had three other plays produced: God's Gentry (1951, a ballad opera about the tinkers), Lady Spider (1959, about Deirdre of the Sorrows and the Three sons of Ussna and by far his best writing) and Step in the Hollow a piece of situation comedy nonsense. He also wrote short stories; published Twenty Poems with Niall Sheridan; staged the first Irish production of ‘’Murder in the Cathedral’’ with Liam Redmond, later his brother-in-law; and was a popular broadcaster on Radio Éireann. == Literature == === Poetry collections === * 1941 - Veterans and Other Poems, Cuala Press, Dublin 1941 * 1947 - The Hungry Grass, Faber & Faber, London 1947 * 1954 - The Ballad of Jane Shore, Dolmen Press, Dublin 1954 * 1958 - The Oxford Book of Irish Verse: XVIIth Century - XXth Century, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1958 (editor with Lennox Robinson) * 1969 - A Warning to Conquerors, Dolmen Press, Dublin 1969 (preface by Niall Sheridan) === Plays === * 1946 - Happy As Larry, Maurice Fridberg, London 1946 A ballad opera.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 11, 2007. It was written by Daniel Chun, and directed by Nancy Kruse. Jane Kaczmarek guest starred as her recurring character, Judge Constance Harm. ==Plot== Homer surprises the family with a newly decorated basement, now a recreation room with a pinball machine, a ping-pong table and other luxury items, prompting Marge to ask how Homer could afford all this. He says he has a plan and in the next scene files for bankruptcy before Constance Harm, believing that this will save him from paying his debts. Unfortunately, Harm tells him that the bankruptcy laws have changed and, under the new laws, he has to pay everything back. When looking through the family's expenses, Homer decides to save a lot of money by moving his father out of the retirement home and having him live with the family. The recreation room now doubles as Grampa's bedroom. Homer and Marge go out one night and ask Grampa to babysit Bart and Lisa. Not entirely trusting Grampa's competence as a babysitter, Marge also asks her sister Selma Bouvier to come over and watch Grampa watch the kids. During the evening, Grampa and Selma end up kissing and eventually fall in love with each other, and are unaware that they are caught by Homer, much to his dismay, as he wants his dad to end up old and lonely. However, just as she was when Abe previously dated Selma's mother Jacqueline in \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\", Marge is happy with the arrangement, noting that Selma and Abe are like a yummy hot dog made from the parts of a pig no one wants. Patty is no happier than Homer and she enlists his help to break them up. Patty impersonates Selma and Homer dresses up as \\"Esteban de la Sexface\\", a Spanish lover-type, and the two arrange for Grampa to catch them kissing. Their plan is foiled though, when the actual Selma comes by and catches them. Angry at being manipulated, Grampa proposes to Selma and she accepts. They get married and move in together. With Abe unable to find work, Selma is the sole breadwinner in the family, working hard in her new, more stressful job as department manager at the DMV. Abe, meanwhile, destroys their kitchen with his ignorance of how things work by misusing the appliances, causing a kitchen fire. This makes Selma realise that maybe love is not everything you need after all, and she dances with him one last time. They presumably divorce, with Grampa moving back to the retirement home and Selma moving back to her and Patty's room at Spinster Arms Apartments. Kicked out of the rec room, Bart and Lisa order a lot of complimentary shipping boxes from the A.S.S. (\\"American Shipping Services, not affiliated with the human ass\\"), getting the idea from Ned Flanders, and build a fort out of them. When the Wiseguy becomes angry and asks for them back, they refuse, whereupon he threatens to come back and get them by force (while using a cliche Lord of the Rings accent). Bart and Lisa think he is bluffing, but in fact, he comes back with an army of delivery men and women. Bart and Lisa put up a brave fight, first by releasing a barrage of cardboard tubes to trip the enemies, then using cardboard squares to throw like shuriken. The delivery men and women set up a siege ladder and Lisa wraps the lead man in tape and pushes the ladder down. They are aided by Nelson, who arrives unexpectedly to aid Lisa, saving her from a barrage of cardboard arrows. He dives down with twin cardboard tubes and fends off a large number of delivery men and women, while one of the enemies flies overhead, upon a giant, red Fell Beast. The army swarms while Bart uses a cardboard tube to shoot down enemies with bricks, beehives, egg cartons and Snowball II. The A.S.S. legion fails and flees, but the kids immediately lose interest in their fort and melt it with the garden hose (ignoring the dead Fell beast nearby). ==Cultural references== *The title of this episode is a pun on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. *The episode \\"Gump Roast\\", broadcast five seasons earlier, jokingly suggested that Patty and Selma and Grampa would marry in a future plotline during the ending song \\"They'll Never Stop The Simpsons\\", alongside other joke plotlines such as Marge becoming a robot. *To save gas, Homer says he is \\"Flintstoning\\" the car (cutting a hole in the floor so he can stick his legs through and push the car, as Fred Flintstone does, with the same sound effect but not the same efficiency). Homer also says \\"Yabba-Dabba-Do!\\". *\\"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\\" by Joe Jackson plays during Selma and Grampa in love sequence. *The battle sequence with Bart, Lisa, and the box salesmen uses The Fields of the Pelennor, a portion of the score from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and the scene itself is a parody of the Battle of the Hornburg from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields also from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Lisa also references the movie when she says to Nelson \\"you've come to help us in our hour of need.\\" One of the A.S.S. delivery men even flies a fell beast like the Nazgûl. Lisa also says \\"It begins\\" as the enemy attack begins, as King Théoden says \\"So it begins\\" before the Uruk-hai attack Helm's Deep. *Lisa calls the box fort Boxingham Palace, a reference to Buckingham Palace. *When Selma is admitting to Abe that their marriage will not work, she claims that The Beatles may not have been right, and that maybe, \\"love isn't all you need.\\" This is a reference to the Beatles song, \\"All You Need Is Love\\". *Right before the battle Bart asks Lisa, \\"Who knew guys in brown shirts could cause so much trouble?\\" This is a reference to the brown shirts of the NSDAP's Sturmabteilung. ==Reception== The episode drew 8.98 million viewers on its first broadcast on Fox. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 6 out of 10, concluding \\"Again, this was an episode that had a handful of funny bits, but none of it came together to tell a solid, original story. And that's one of the major downfalls that's been hurting the show of late -- running out of stories to tell. This isn't too surprising after 18 seasons, but you'd think they would have been able to come up with something better than another Selma marriage that you already knew was going to fail.\\" Adam Finley of AOLTV wrote \\"This episode had some good laughs, but overall I wasn't too impressed\\". == References Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"Rome-Old and Juli-Eh"},{"id":"7789085","text":"The Tunaij (), also spelled as Tanaij (singular Tunaiji ), is an Arab tribe in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

At the turn of the 19th century, there were some 4,000 Tunaij in the Northern Emirates, of whom 1,500 were Bedouin. Influential in tribal politics because they could raise a force of some 500 fighting men, the Bedouin Tunaij used Dhaid as a centre and a fortified tower protected the 70-odd Tunaij houses there (the Na'im maintained a similar arrangement at Dhaid).

He is best known for the development of the pneumatic dynamite torpedo-gun. ==Early life and military service== Zalinski was born to a Jewish family in Kórnik, Prussian Poland on December 13, 1849, and emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1853. He began school in Seneca Falls, New York and attended high school in Syracuse until 1863, when he dropped out at the age of 15. Lying about his age, Zalinski enlisted in the United States Army, and served during the American Civil War as aide-de-camp on the staff of General Nelson A. Miles from October 1864. In February 1865, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Second New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, having been recommended for promotion for gallant and meritorious conduct at the Battle of Hatcher's Run, Virginia. He continued on General Miles's staff until the surrender of General Robert E. Lee in April 1865. Zalinski was mustered out of the volunteer service in September 1865 and was recommended for an appointment in the regular army. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Fifth United States Artillery on February 23, 1866. He was promoted to first lieutenant in January 1867, and finally to captain on December 9, 1887. In 1867, Lieutenant Zalinski served with the 5th Artillery at the Fort Jefferson military prison, located on the Dry Tortugas islands of the Gulf of Mexico, about 70 miles west of Key West, Florida, and 90 miles north of Havana, Cuba. Four of the prisoners there were Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlen, and Edwin Spangler, who had all been found guilty in the 1865 Lincoln assassination trial. During an 1867 yellow fever epidemic at Fort Jefferson, Dr. Mudd was credited with saving the lives of many of those at the fort. Lieutenant Zalinski authored a petition to President Andrew Johnson, signed by 300 of the soldiers at the fort, to free Dr. Mudd for his heroic service during the epidemic. President Johnson pardoned Dr. Mudd in 1869, citing Lieutenant Zalinski's petition as one of the reasons. ==Academia and military engineering== From 1872 till 1876 Zalinski served at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as professor of military science. He completed training at the U.S. Army Artillery School at Fort Monroe, on May 1, 1880, and at the school of submarine mining, Willets Point, New York, in July of the same year. His name became widely known in connection with the invention and development of items of military technology, particularly the pneumatic dynamite torpedo-gun. He also invented the electrical fuse and other devices for the practical application of the weapon, and devised a method for the exact sight allowance to be made for deviation due to wind in the use of rifled artillery and small arms. Other inventions included a modified entrenching tool, a ramrod-bayonet, and a telescopic sight for artillery. Zalinski also helped John Philip Holland raise money for the development of one of his submarines, which was armed with one of Zalinski's pneumatic guns. The two men having formed the Nautilus Submarine Boat Company, started working on a new submarine in 1884. The so-called \\"Zalinsky boat\\" was constructed in Hendrick's Reef (former Fort Lafayette), Bay Ridge in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. \\"The new, cigar-shaped submarine was 50 feet long with a maximum beam of eight feet. To save money, the hull was largely of wood, framed with iron hoops, and again, a Brayton-cycle engine provided motive power.\\" The project was plagued by a \\"shoestring budget\\" and Zalinski mostly rejecting Holland's ideas on improvements. The submarine was ready for launching in September, 1885. \\"During the launching itself, a section of the ways collapsed under the weight of the boat, dashing the hull against some pilings and staving in the bottom. Although the submarine was repaired and eventually carried out several trial runs in lower New York Harbor, by the end of 1886 the Nautilus Submarine Boat Company was no more, and the salvageable remnants of the Zalinski Boat were sold to reimburse the disappointed investors.\\" Holland would not create another submarine to 1893.Edward C. Whitman, \\"John Holland, Father of the modern Submarine\\". Chapter: \\"A Disappointing Hiatus\\"\\" In 1889 and 1890 Zalinski traveled in Europe to study military affairs. He undertook garrison duty at San Francisco, California in 1892, and retired from the Army on February 3, 1894. On April 23, 1904 he was promoted to major on the retired list. He was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants. Zalinski died of pneumonia in Rochester, New York. ==References== * * ==External links== *Article at JewishEncyclopedia.com * * Lieutenant Zalinski's Petition to President Johnson Category:1849 births Category:1909 deaths Category:People from Kórnik Category:People from the Province of Posen Category:19th-century American inventors Category:Polish inventors Category:Union Army soldiers Category:Submarine pioneers Category:Polish emigrants to the United States Category:Polish people of the American Civil War ","title":"Edmund Zalinski"},{"id":"7789159","text":"Portastatic is an American indie rock band founded in the early 1990s by Mac McCaughan.

She served as Poet Laureate of Texas (1988-1989). ==Biography== Miller was born in Houston, Texas, the daughter of real estate investor Jesse G. Miller. She began writing as a child, composing on a typewriter due to the cerebral palsy which affected her speech and movement. She attended the University of Houston, receiving her B.A. and M.A. in English. In 1956, Miller published her first volume of poetry, Adam's Footprint. Her poems, most of which dealt with either her strong religious faith or her experiences as a person with a disability, were widely praised for their rigorous formality, clarity, and emotional impact. Her poems have been published in hundreds of periodicals and more than 50 anthologies, including Spanish translations in Latin American journals. The lasting power of Ms. Miller's poetry and its distinctiveness was aptly described by many, including author Larry McMurtry. Reflecting on the qualities that make the work of only a few artists survive, Mr. McMurtry wrote of Vassar Miller and her poetry: “It’s easy to point out her clarity, her precision, her intelligence, her honesty. But I want to mention one other quality that I think she has both as a person and as a poet, and that is her tenacity. It’s not simply brute survival that a poet is involved with, although sometimes they are; it’s more than that. It’s a tenacity that has to be at one and the same time, physical, intellectual, and moral. I believe this tenacity is something that Vassar Miller is richly endowed with.” Over the course of a literary career which spanned almost forty years, Miller published ten volumes of poetry in all. Vassar Miller's ten volumes of poetry, published between 1956 and 1984 were collected in 1991 under the title If I Had Wheels or Love. An outspoken advocate for the rights and dignity of the handicapped, Miller also edited a collection of poetry and short stories about persons with disabilities titled Despite This Flesh. Miller received many awards and accolades for her poetry in her home state. Three of her books won the annual poetry prize of the Texas Institute of Letters. In 1982 and 1988 Miller was named Poet Laureate of Texas, and in 1997 she was named to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame by the Governor's Commission for Women. In addition to her writing and teaching, Ms. Miller was involved in civic work and in 1989 the Young Women's Christian Association named her an Outstanding Woman of Houston.

Verzeichniss bekannter Schmettlinge, 17-176, 1819. They are commonly known as buckeyes, pansies or commodores. This genus flies on every continent except Antarctica. The genus contains roughly 30 to 35 species. ==Description== These butterflies are medium to large (wingspan 40–110 mm). The ground colour is brown or grey suffused blue. Spots on the wings are orange, blue or pink and sometimes large. Many of the species can occur in several colour forms. The head is of moderate size with smooth, prominent eyes. The palpi are rather long, sharply pointed, ascending, generally convergent and scaly, sometimes more or less hairy. The antennae are of moderate length, generally with a rather short, abruptly formed club. The thorax is robust, ovate, rather sparingly clothed with hairs. The wing characters are: large, broad, variable in outline. Forewing: costa more or less arched, sometimes very strongly so; apical portion more or less produced, sometimes very prominent, with a strong projection on the hind margin at the extremity of the first discoidal nervule; hind margin always more or less dentate and emarginate, with, in many species, a considerable projection at extremity of third median nervule; inner margin nearly straight, or slightly emarginate about centre; discoidal cell generally closed by a slender nervule. Hindwing: costa strongly arched at base, and more or less so throughout; hind margin always more or less scalloped, sometimes simply rounded (without any marked projections), sometimes with a more or less elongate production of anal angle, and occasionally with a longer or shorter projection of hind margin at extremity of first median nervule; inner margins deeply grooved and entirely covering the under surface of the abdomen; discoidal cell generally open. The abdomen short, compressed, rather slender. The larvae are rather stout, almost of equal thickness throughout, armed with strong branched spines; sometimes with two short, similar spines on head. The pupae are moderately angulated, with raised tubercles on the back, head slightly bifid. Sometimes hardly angulated, the anterior portions more rounded. ==Biology== Junonia are good fliers. The larvae feed on a wide variety of plants, among others Labiatae, Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Onagraceae, Leguminosae, Balsaminaceae, Gramineae, Melastomataceae, Plantaginaceae, Aucubaceae and Compositae. ==Taxonomy== The leaf butterflies J. ansorgei and J. cymodoce (both from Africa) have traditionally been included in Kallima, but this genus is now usually limited to Asian species. Instead of being placed in Junonia, the two are sometimes awarded their own genus, Kamilla. The leaf butterfly J. tugela is sometimes included in Precis instead of Junonia.

It is west of the North West Slopes, Central West and the Riverina. It is an area with limited rainfall, and the only major rivers found in it are the Darling River and the Murray River (on its southern edge), which originate in the Great Dividing Range to the east. The region corresponds to the combination of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's forecast areas of Upper Western and Lower Western. It also corresponds to the Western Division established under the New South Wales Western Lands Act 1901. Its only city is Broken Hill, and other significant towns are Bourke, Brewarrina, Cobar, Ivanhoe and Wentworth. Ninety-five per cent of the region is uncleared. The major industries are mining and extensive pasturing. During good seasons in the 1870s and 1880s, large sheep stations were established with high stocking rates, partly in response to a widespread belief that the introduction of European agriculture would cause climate change in favour of European conditions. This 'rain follows the plough' myth was shattered by the droughts of the 1890s, and many of the stations established during this period were subsequently abandoned. The Far West region is traversed by the Barrier Highway, the Silver City Highway, the Mitchell Highway, the Cobb Highway and the Sturt Highway and by the Sydney-Perth Railway. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Regions of New South Wales Category:Murray-Darling basin ","title":"Far West (New South Wales)"},{"id":"7789235","text":"Jorge Carrera Andrade was an Ecuadorian poet, historian, author, and diplomat during the 20th century. He was born in Quito, Ecuador in 1902. He died in 1978. During his life and after his death he has been recognized with Jorge Luis Borges, Vicente Huidobro, Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz and Cesar Vallejo as one of the most important Latin American poets of the twentieth century. ==Writing and diplomatic career== From 1928-33 Carrera first experienced traveling in Europe. He served as Ecuadorian Consul in Peru, France, Japan and the United States. Later he became Ambassador to Venezuela, the United Kingdom, Nicaragua, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. He also served as Secretary of State of Ecuador. While living in the United States, Carrera developed many literary relationships with American writers, in particular Muna Lee whose critically acclaimed translation of his poetry, Secret Country, was published in 1946. His work was praised and championed by John Malcolm Brinnin, H.R. Hays, Archibald MacLeish, Carl Sandburg, William Jay Smith and William Carlos Williams. Carrera Andrade's poetic work developed for half a century in a number of volumes published worldwide. In 1972 his Obra poetica completa, which gathers the totality of his lyric work, appeared in Quito. Most of his poetry has been translated into French, English, Italian and German. He also published books of essays, history and an autobiography, El volcan y el colibri (The Volcano and the Hummingbird) (1970). After Carrera's diplomatic career ended in 1969, he was appointed Distinguished Visiting Professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, where he lectured for two academic years. He spent his last years in his native city of Quito, as Director of the National Library of Ecuador. During his life and after his death he has been recognized with Jorge Luis Borges, Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz and Cesar Vallejo as one of the most important Latin American poets of the twentieth century. ==A celebrated poet== In 2002 the Republic of Ecuador celebrated the century of his birth. In the same year a group of Ecuadorian intellectuals gathered in Cuenca, Ecuador, to examine the life and work of Carrera Andrade. == Bibliography == ===Prose In English=== * Carrera Andrade, Jorge, \\"The New American and His Point of View Toward Poetry,\\" tr.

Lieutenant-general Sir Henry Richard Legge Nedwigate (1832–1908) was a younger brother. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. ==Military career== Newdegate was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in 1842. He served as a captain in the Crimean War 1854–55, including the Siege of Sevastopol and was present at the Battle of Alma (Sep 1854) and at the Battle of Inkerman (Nov 1854), where he was wounded. For his services in the war, he was mentioned in despatches, received a brevet promotion to major, the Crimea Medal with three clasps, the Turkish Crimean War medal, and was awarded the knighthood of the French Legion d'Honneur and the fifth class of the Order of Medjidie. In 1861 he left the Rifle Brigade, and was employed in Canada. From 1865 to 1870 he was assistant adjutant general at Aldershot, and from 1873 to 1877 he commanded first the Carlisle Regimental district, then the Rifle Depot at Winchester. In 1878 he was appointed in command of the Chatham district, but relinquished the command the following year for active service. He served as General Officer Commanding the 2nd Division during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his service in the war. On his return to England, he became General Officer Commanding South- Eastern District in April 1880, serving until 1885. After inheriting Astley Castle and the Arbury and Harefield estates of Charles Newdigate Newdegate in 1887, he took the surname Newdegate by Royal licence. Later the same year he was promoted to lieutenant-general, and the following year he became Governor of Bermuda. He held the post until retirement in 1892, and was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 26 May 1894. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Warwickshire from 27 August 1898. He was Colonel of the Devonshire Regiment from 1897 to 1902. ==Family== Newdegate married, in 1858, Anne Emily Garnier, daughter of Thomas Garnier, Dean of Lincoln, and his wife Lady Caroline Keppel, daughter of the 4th Earl of Albemarle. Newdegate lived in retirement at Arbury Hall. He had both his legs amputated, first his left, and in July 1902 his right leg. This proved too much of a strain, and he died at Brighton on 1 August 1902. He was succeeded in the estates by a nephew, Francis Newdigate Newdegate. In late 1902 a memorial table to Newdegate was placed in the church at Chilvers Coton, Warwickshire, of which he was patron. ==References== Category:1902 deaths Category:1825 births Category:People from the Borough of North Warwickshire Category:British Army personnel of the Crimean War Category:British Army personnel of the Anglo-Zulu War Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:British Army generals Category:Governors of Bermuda ","title":"Edward Newdegate"},{"id":"7789251","text":"Charles Alexandre Casimir Poulenard (30 March 1885 – 10 November 1958) was a French sprinter who competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

It was an exclusive right to print a work or a class of works. The earliest recorded printing privilege dates from 1469, giving John of Speyer a five-year monopoly on all printing in Venice. In 1495, the city-state granted another monopoly on all Greek works to Aldus as a reward for his investments in a Greek font for his press.Jackson, M. (2002) From Private to Public: Reexamining the Technological Basis for Copyright, Journal of Communication, 52, 416-433 In France, the royal Code de la librairie of 1723 codified existing practice. It stated that there was no property in ideas or texts. Ideas, it was argued, were a gift from God, revealed through the writer. God's first representative, the French king had the exclusive right to determine what could be printed by whom. Only members of the royal guild of publishers could apply for a \\"printing privilege\\", a permission and an exclusive right to print a work. Authors wishing to see their manuscript printed had no choice but to sell it to guild members. Most printing privileges were owned by the guild and automatically renewed over generations. In 1789, the National Assembly created by the French Revolution brought an end to all royal privileges.Hesse, C. (1990) Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship in Revolutionary France, 1777-1793 Representations, 109-137 English monarchs granted printing patents based on the Royal Prerogative, with patents falling into one of two categories: particular patents gave an exclusive right to print a single work - often popular, classic works written centuries earlier - for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. General patents were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or almanacs. Printing patents were independent of the private copyright system established by the Stationers' Company, even though most printing patents were granted to members of the Company.

It is part of the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway and receives its inflow from a short segment of the Fox River which drains from the north end of Lake Winnebago around Doty Island. The north end of Little Lake Butte des Morts becomes the section of the Fox River running to Green Bay. The lake is part of the Butte des Morts region in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. The southern half of the lake is located within the cities of Menasha and Neenah. The name \\"Butte des Morts\\" was given by French settlers, and means \\"Mound of the Dead\\" in reference to a nearby Indian burial mound. French archives state that in 1716, over 8000 civilians and over 500 soldiers lived within the fortified walls of Little Lake Butte des Morts. In 1716, during the Fox Wars, French expeditionary forces laid siege to the fort, in the battle of the Siege of Little Butte des Mortes, and massacred most of the inhabitants.

Like most other operators in C++, it can be overloaded. The copy assignment operator, often just called the \\"assignment operator\\", is a special case of assignment operator where the source (right-hand side) and destination (left-hand side) are of the same class type. It is one of the special member functions, which means that a default version of it is generated automatically by the compiler if the programmer does not declare one. The default version performs a memberwise copy, where each member is copied by its own copy assignment operator (which may also be programmer- declared or compiler-generated). The copy assignment operator differs from the copy constructor in that it must clean up the data members of the assignment's target (and correctly handle self-assignment) whereas the copy constructor assigns values to uninitialized data members. For example: My_Array first; // initialization by default constructor My_Array second(first); // initialization by copy constructor My_Array third = first; // Also initialization by copy constructor second = third; // assignment by copy assignment operator ==Return value of overloaded assignment operator== The language permits an overloaded assignment operator to have an arbitrary return type (including \`void\`). However, the operator is usually defined to return a reference to the assignee. This is consistent with the behavior of assignment operator for built-in types (returning the assigned value) and allows for using the operator invocation as an expression, for instance in control statements or in chained assignment. Also, the C++ Standard Library requires this behavior for some user-supplied types.Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++, Section 17.6.3.1, Table 23; http://www.open- std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf ==Overloading copy assignment operator== When deep copies of objects have to be made, exception safety should be taken into consideration. One way to achieve this when resource deallocation never fails is: # Acquire new resources # Release old resources # Assign the new resources' handles to the object class My_Array{ int* array; int count; public: My_Array& operator=(const My_Array& other) { if (this != &other;) { // protect against invalid self-assignment // 1: allocate new memory and copy the elements int* new_array = new int[other.count]; std::copy(other.array, other.array + other.count, new_array); // 2: deallocate old memory delete[] array; // 3: assign the new memory to the object array = new_array; count = other.count; } // by convention, always return *this return *this; } // ... }; However, if a no-fail (no-throw) swap function is available for all the member subobjects and the class provides a copy constructor and destructor (which it should do according to the rule of three), the most straightforward way to implement copy assignment is as follows: public: void swap(My_Array & other) // the swap member function (should never fail!) { // swap all the members (and base subobject, if applicable) with other using std::swap; // because of ADL the compiler will use // custom swap for members if it exists // falling back to std::swap swap(array, other.array); swap(count, other.count); } My_Array & operator = (My_Array other) // note: argument passed by value! { // swap this with other swap(other); // by convention, always return *this return *this; // other is destroyed, releasing the memory } ==Assignment between different classes== C++ supports assignment between different classes, both via implicit copy constructor and assignment operator, if the destination instance class is the ancestor of the source instance class: class Ancestor { public: int a; }; class Descendant : public Ancestor { public: int b; }; int main() { Descendant d; Ancestor a(d); Ancestor b(d); a = d; } Copying from ancestor to descendant objects, which could leave descendant's fields uninitialized, is not permitted. ==See also== *Operator overloading *Rule of three (C++ programming) *Operators in C and C++ ==References== ==External links== * The Anatomy of the Assignment Operator, by Richard Gillam Category:C++ Category:Operators (programming) Category:Assignment operations ","title":"Assignment operator (C++)"},{"id":"7789358","text":"Vasyl Albertovych Arkhypenko (, , Vasiliy Albertovich Arkhipenko; born 28 January 1957 in Mykolaivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR) was a Soviet athlete who competed mainly in the 400 metre hurdles.

The villages are by the River Eden north-east of Carlisle, joined by a road that used to be the line of the Stanegate Roman road. It has been thought on spacing grounds that there might have been a small Roman fort in Crosby-on-Eden, as part of the so-called Stanegate frontier which preceded Hadrian's Wall, but if such a fort exists it has not yet been found. The Stanegate ran in a deep cutting still visible next to the road running west from High Crosby, and it has been suggested that part of the reason for the cutting was to produce stone for building work.Roman roads in Cumbria, www.romanroads.org The line of Hadrian's Wall passes a mile or so to the north, and the Hadrian's Wall Path follows the Stanegate through the villages. In Low Crosby is the Church of St John the Evangelist, a rebuilt church by R.H. Billings in the Gothic style. A grange was built here and named Crosby. High Crosby is a half mile east of Low Crosby, and located in the village is Crosby House, a former mansion that is now a hotel. The villages are bypassed by the A689 road which used to be numbered as part of the B6264 and follows the route of General Wade's Military Road. Crosby-on-Eden has a primary school, Crosby-on-Eden C. of E. School, built in 1844. ==RAF Crosby-on-Eden== RAF Crosby-on-Eden was a Second World War airfield which was home to No.59 Operational Training Unit providing day training for Hawker Hurricane pilots. It was replaced by No. 9 Operational Training Unit, 17 Group Coastal Command, in August 1942 for training long-range fighter crews on Bristol Beaufort and Bristol Beaufighter conversion squadrons, as well as air firing and night flying. In August 1944, the station came under the command of No. 109 Operational Training Unit, a transport command of Douglas Dakotas.History of Dakota KG651 The station was renamed 1383 TCU on 1 August 1945. After the Second World War, British European Airways commenced flights to Ronaldsway and Belfast. However, the RAF station had no post-war use or need and was closed in 1947. It was reopened in 1960 as Carlisle Airport. Since 2006 the airport has been known as Carlisle Lake District Airport, and since 30 May 2009 the airport lease has been owned by the Stobart Group. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Stanwix Rural ==References== ==External links== *Entry at \\"The Cumbria Directory\\" *A walk along the Roman Heritage Way *Eden Golf course and range *Church of St John the Evangelist Category:Villages in Cumbria Category:City of Carlisle ","title":"Crosby-on-Eden"},{"id":"7789430","text":"Booka Shade is a German house duo.

Her work uses portraiture photography and traditional landscape imagery to explore social constructs such as Britishness or racial difference. Pollard is associated with Autograph, the Association of Black Photographers. She lives and works in London. In the 1980s, Pollard produced a series of photographs of black people in rural landscapes, entitled Pastoral Interludes.Michael Woods, Rural Geography: Processes, Responses and Experiences in Rural Restructuring, SAGE, 2005, p. 282. The works challenge the way that English culture places black people in cities.Kay Anderson, Mona Domosh, Steve Pile, Handbook of Cultural Geography, SAGE, 2003, p. 260. From 2005 to 2007, she curated Tradewinds2007, an international residency exhibition project with an exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands. She has participated in group exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Pollard has worked as an artist in residence at a number of organisations, including Lee Valley Park Authority, London (1994), Cumbria National Park (1998), Wysing Arts, Cambridge (2000), Chenderit School, Oxfordshire (2008), and Croydon College (2011). She has also held numerous teaching positions and is currently a lecturer in Photography at Kingston University. Pollard is a member of the Mapping Spectral Traces research group. In 2016 she was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society. In 2018 she was the inaugural Stuart Hall Associate Fellow at the University of Sussex. == Life == === Childhood === Pollard was born in Georgetown, Guyana in 1953. When she was three or four years old, her family emigrated to the United Kingdom, where her father already lived, and she grew up in London. She has described her youthful awareness of family photographs. > \\"I do not remember the first time I took a photograph, but I did grow up in > a house of family photo-albums and the stories that went with them. My > father took lots of pictures for our albums and later I used some of these > images in my own work.\\" Pollard began to make her own pictures using her father's box camera. As a teenager in the late 1960s, she photographed woods and sewage works in the Lee Valley, East London for a school Geography project, a foretaste of her mature photographic work examining the landscape. === Early career and education === As a young artist, Pollard became increasingly interested in liberation movements around race, gender and sexuality. In the early 1980s, she worked at the Lenthall Road Workshop, a feminist photography and screen-printing collective in the Haggerston area of Hackney, East London. She was one of twenty founding members of Autograph (the Association of Black Photographers) in 1988. Pollard has participated several exhibitions that brought together work by Black British artists, including Black Women Time Now (Battersea Arts Centre, London, 1984), The Thin Black Line (ICA, London, 1985) and Three Black Women Photographers (Commonwealth Institute, London, 1986). Pollard completed a BA in Film and Video at the London College of Printing in 1988 and, between 1986 and 1993, worked on the technical crew for a small number of film projects. Her photography was recognised in a survey edition of Birmingham's Ten.8 magazine'Critical Decade: Black British Photography in the 80s', Ten.8 vol. 2, no. 3, 1992 She then went on to complete an MA in Photographic Studies at Derby University in 1995. She was awarded a PhD by publication by University of Westminster in 2016. == Work == In the 1980s, Pollard began to attract attention for her photographic series, particularly those exploring the presence of black people in the English landscape, including Pastoral Interlude (1987–1988), Seaside Series (1989), Wordsworth's Heritage (1992) and Self Evident (1995). In these series, she worked with material that evoked notions of heritage or played upon nostalgic sentiments associated with the national landscape: the souvenir postcard, the poetry of William Wordsworth and hand-tinted photographs. She often placed text statements and quotations alongside her images to suggest a political framework for her photographic work. Developing such forms allowed Pollard to challenge traditional views of the English landscape as a zone exclusively owned by white people, and the related assumption that Black British people are only to be imagined in an urban setting. These racially specific stereotypes of rural England are set out in the caption attached to the first image of Pastoral Interlude: > \\"... it's as if the Black experience is only lived within an urban > environment: I thought I liked the Lake District where I wandered lonely as > a Black face in a sea of white. A visit to the countryside is always > accompanied by a feeling of unease, dread...\\" From 2005 to 2008, Pollard was engaged in a research project into the \\"Black Boy\\" - a once-common name for English pubs. This led to the publication of Pollard's book, Hidden in Public Place. and a solo exhibition, Spectre of the Black Boy (Kingsway Gallery, Goldsmiths University of London, 2009). ==Awards== Pollard was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 2016.

The western region of Kyongwon is mountainous, while the east is relatively flat. The highest point is Chungsan. The largest river is the Tumen, which flows along the eastern border. Numerous tributaries of the Tumen also flow through the county. Approximately 75% of the county is forested. Aside from agriculture, livestock raising and sericulture are widespread. The chief local crops are rice, corn, and soybeans. Bituminous coal is also mined. Railroads passing through Kyongwon include the Hambuk and Kogonwon Lines. It is also connected by Shatuozi Border Road bridge to the Chinese city of Hunchun in the Yanbian autonomous prefecture. ==History== Under Joseon period Kyongwon was invaded by Jurchens tribes in 1409. Therefore, to safeguard his people from the hostile Chinese and Jurchen people (later known as Manchus) living in Manchuria, King Sejong the Great of Joseon ordered to establish there one of the six post/garrisons (hangul :육진 hanja :六鎭) in 1433.

It is a holding company through which shareholders manage numerous subsidiaries. It traces its roots to 1992. Private limited liability company Vilniaus prekyba is a private holding company, headquartered in Vilnius, Lithuania, that oversees, controls and manages the group of subsidiary companies operating retail and pharmacy chains, real estate development and shopping centre lease and management companies in the Baltic states, Poland, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The Holding is a descendant of number of companies, which during the last decade have been undergoing frequent mergers as well as other changes within the boundaries of the same group, ultimately controlled by handful of Lithuanian individuals. Although the currently existing holding structure may be traced back as early as to the beginning of 2003, it was during the year 2004, when the long-lasting fundamentals of the holding company were laid down by the shareholders through accumulation of their shares in different companies under the umbrella of the Holding. Its principal shareholder is Nerijus Numavičius. Prior to the present-day shape, in constant pursuit of improved efficiency, streamlined processes as well as optimal decision-making, the structure and composition of the group was subject to alterations number of times. Currently, the Holding is exclusively designed to manage, oversee and develop the network of retail stores and pharmacies chains. ==Major subsidiaries== By means of its subsidiaries – private limited liability companies Maxima grupė, Euroapotheca, Akropolis group and ERMI Group – Vilniaus Prekyba operates retail and pharmacy chains, real estate development and shopping centre lease and management companies in the Baltic states, Poland, Bulgaria and Sweden. ==History== The company was founded by nine men, who earned the nickname of VP 9 (Lithuanian\\" VP devintukas): brothers Vladas Numavicius, Julius Numavicius and Nerijus Numavičius, brothers Žilvinas, Mindaugas and Gintaras Marcinkevičius, Ignas Staškevičius, Renatas Vaitkevičius, Mindaugas Bagdonavičius. The core group met as medical students at Vilnius University.„VP dešimtukas“: nuo 1992-ųjų iki šių dienų They started transacting in real estate. The retail business began when they could not resell a liquor store. Soon it became the main focus of the group. The extensive growth of the retail chain was funded by sale of various stocks that the group acquired during post-Soviet privatization campaigns. One of the transaction involved stock sale of four sugar refineries to Danisco. Other companies included Vilniaus paukštynas (poultry farm), Birštono mineraliniai vandenys (mineral water), Vilniaus mėsos kombinatas (meat packing), Vilniaus duona (bakery). In 2003, VP Group, through its subsidiary UAB NDX energija, bought 97.1% of shares in Vakarų skirstomieji tinklai (Western Power Grid Company), electricity distributor. After the successful transaction Darius Nedzinskas became the 10th shareholder of the VP Group in 2007. The group further pursued ambitious goals in the energy sector, becoming shareholder of LEO LT, the national investor established to raise funds for the planned construction of the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant. After the failure of LEO LT in September 2009, the group had fallen out, undergoing significant changes in ownership and leadership. ==References== == External links == *MAXIMA GRUPĖ, UAB website *UAB Ermitažas website *Akropolis group, UAB website *Euroapotheca, UAB website *Vilniaus prekyba, UAB website Category:Financial services companies of Lithuania Category:Holding companies of Lithuania Category:Companies based in Vilnius Category:Holding companies established in 1992 Category:Lithuanian companies established in 1992 ","title":"Vilniaus prekyba"},{"id":"7789723","text":"Ginger Baker's Air Force 2 was the second and final album by Ginger Baker's Air Force, released in 1970.

At the age of 9, he began his studies at the Shuyukan Han school. He was selected to be a student member of the Iwakura Mission, and was left behind in the United States to study at Harvard University while the rest of the mission continued on to Europe and around the world back to Japan. While at Harvard, Kaneko shared lodgings with fellow Japanese student and future fellow-diplomat Komura Jutarō. He also developed a wide circle of contacts in America, including lawyers, scientists, journalists and industrialists. While at Harvard, Kaneko made a telephone call to fellow exchange student Itō Junji. This was the first instance of a telephone conversation between two Japanese people.Osatake, IEEE Transactions Vol 20 Issue 4, pp.687–688 After graduation from Harvard in 1878, Kaneko returned to Japan as a lecturer at Tokyo Imperial University. == Government career == Kaneko Kentarō Kaneko Kentarō In 1880, Kaneko was appointed as a secretary in the Genrōin, and in 1884 had joined the Office for Investigation of Institutions, the body organized by the Genrōin to study the constitutions of various western nations with the aim of creating a western- style constitution for Japan. Kaneko worked closely with Itō Hirobumi, Inoue Kowashi and Itō Miyoji, and became personal secretary to Itō Hirobumi when the latter became first Prime Minister of Japan. In 1889, Kaneko became first president of the predecessor to Nippon University, a post he held until 1893. Kaneko was appointed to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan in 1890, becoming its first Secretary. He was subsequently appointed as Vice Minister, then briefly Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in 1898 in the third Itō administration. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Harvard in 1899 for his work on the Meiji Constitution. In 1900 Kaneko was appointed as Minister of Justice under the fourth Itō administration and was made baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage system in 1907. == Russo-Japanese War == In 1904 during the middle of the Russo-Japanese War, at the personal request of Itō Hirobumi, Kaneko returned to the United States as a special envoy from the Japanese government to enlist American diplomatic support in bringing the war to a speedy conclusion. In April 1904, Kaneko addressed before the Japan Club of Harvard University that Japan was fighting to maintain the peace of Asia and to conserve the influence of Anglo-American civilization in the East.Isabel Anderson, \\"The Spell of Japan\\", Boston, 1914, p.14. While in the United States, Kaneko revived contacts with Theodore Roosevelt, with whom he had been contemporaneously at Harvard (though they did not meet until later, introduced by William Sturgis Bigelow in 1889), and requested that Roosevelt help Japan mediate a peace treaty. When Kaneko met Roosevelt, the president asked for a book that would help explain the character of the Japanese people—what motivates them, their culture and spiritual education in Japan. Kaneko gave Roosevelt a copy of 'Bushido', and several months later, Roosevelt thanked Kaneko, remarking that it enlightened within him a deeper understanding of the Japanese culture and character. Thereafter, Roosevelt eagerly took on the task and presided over the subsequent Treaty of Portsmouth negotiations. == Later career == Kaneko Kentarō, before 1942 From 1906, Kaneko served as a member of the Privy Council, and was elevated in title to viscount (shishaku) in 1907. In his later years he was engaged in the compilation of a history of the Imperial family and served as secretary general of the association for compiling historical materials about the Meiji Restoration. He completed an official biography of Emperor Meiji in 1915. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1928, and elevated to hakushaku (count) in 1930. Kaneko was a strong proponent of good diplomatic relations with the United States all of his life. In 1900, he established the first . According to the records of the America-Japan Society, Kentaro Kaneko founded that organization in Tokyo, on March 1917, and became its first president. In 1938, during a time of increasingly strident anti-American rhetoric from the Japanese government and press, he established the , a political association calling for a \\"Japanese-American Alliance\\", together with future Prime Minister Takeo Miki. He was one of the few senior statesmen in Japan to speak out strongly against war with the United States as late as 1941. On his death in 1942, Kaneko was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum. ==Honors== *50px Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (April 1, 1906) *50px Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (November 10, 1928) *50px Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (May 16, 1942; posthumous) *Junior First Rank (May 16, 1942; posthumous) == See also == * Suematsu Kenchō – sent on the same mission as Kaneko in 1904 but to Europe * Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. – his home teacher == Notes == == References == * Katz, Stan S.

Whitt was a student of accomplished black golf instructor Lucius Bateman, teacher of such other multiple-tournament-winning PGA Touring pros as Tony Lema, John McMullin, and Dick Lotz. Developing his swing at Oakland's Airway Fairways driving range under Bateman's tutelage, Whitt captured the 1948 Alameda Commuters tournament as a teenager and that summer came within one hole of winning the Northern California Junior Golf Championship. After serving in the U.S. Navy, Whitt decided to turn professional, accepting a job as a club pro at Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, California. There, in 1956, on his way to a world record golf score of 58, he three-putted the final two greens, but managed to establish a course record 60 - a score that still stands after more than a half-century of play by noted professionals and amateurs alike. After leaving Sequoyah, he joined the PGA Tour for several years. In 1957, Whitt finished the Tucson Open Invitational in a tie for first (269), but lost in an 18-hole playoff to Dow Finsterwald. That same year, in an article heralding professional golf's \\"Young Timers\\" Time magazine wrote of Whitt's \\"tremendous rally...that included a startling hole-in-one on the 145-yd 13th\\" before bowing - again to Finsterwald - in the semi-finals of the 1957 PGA Championship. The following year Whitt won his first professional golf tournament, the 1958 Montebello Open. His career year was 1959 when he won Golf Digest's Most Improved Player award. He won the Memphis Open in a playoff on May 25 of that year, and just six days later won the Kentucky Derby Open. In January 1960, Sports Illustrated acknowledged Whitt as \\"a plugger...who can on occasion beat anybody.\\" Aside from Whitt's semi-final loss in the 1957 PGA Championship, his best finish in a major was a T-15 in the 1961 PGA Championship, the same year he captured the Venezuela and Maracaibo Opens, and finished runner-up to Gary Player in the Lucky International tournament in San Francisco. Whitt was a good friend of fellow Bateman-protégé Tony Lema, winner of the 1964 British Open, and is prominently featured in Lema's 1964 memoir \\"Golfer's Gold\\", that related their antics on the Caribbean Tour in 1961.

The Pensions Ombudsman is a non-departmental public body stewarded by the Department of Work and Pensions, and the Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman are appointed by the Minister for Work and Pensions. The Ombudsman is an independent commissioner; he and his staff are not civil servants. His brief is to resolve disputes of fact or law and to investigate claims of maladministration. Unusually for UK Ombudsmen, the Pensions Ombudsman's determinations are binding on the parties and enforceable in the County Court. There is a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law (Court of Session in Scotland and Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland). In England the High Court's permission has to be obtained for an appeal. Although the first UK Ombudsman, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, was established in 1967, followed by the Insurance Ombudsman and other private sector Ombudsman schemes, the first time the title Ombudsman was used by Parliament was to establish the office of Pensions Ombudsman in 1991. The first Pensions Ombudsman was Michael Platt, who had previously been a civil servant. He was succeeded by Dr. Julian Farrand QC(Hon), formerly the Insurance Ombudsman. Prior to his work as an Ombudsman, Dr Farrand had been a Law Commissioner and a University Professor. He is married to Baroness Hale, also previously a Law Commissioner and the first woman to be a member of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, now the Supreme Court, the UK's highest court. Dr Farrand was succeeded by David Laverick, a solicitor who was previously a Director of the Local Government Ombudsman service and chief executive of the Family Health Services Appeal Authority. He was also President of the Adjudication Panel for England, a body which dealt with allegations about the conduct of members of local authorities. Tony King was the Ombudsman from September 2007 to May 2015. Tony King was previously a Principal Ombudsman in the Financial Ombudsman Service. The role of Deputy Pensions Ombudsman was created in December 2004. The first holder of the post was Charlie Gordon, a barrister and Senior Inspector of Taxes who was previously head of the Adjudicator's Office. Jane Irvine, previously Chair of the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission. held the post from November 2009 to May 2015. Tony King was succeeded by Anthony Arter, a solicitor and former police officer who was Eversheds LLP London Senior Partner and Head of Pensions. Jane Irvine was succeeded by Karen Johnston, a barrister who was previously Strategy Lawyer at the Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Ombudsman, together with the Pensions Regulator. the Pensions Advisory Service and the Pensions Registry, are funded by a levy on occupational pension schemes. The Ombudsman's services are free to complainants and respondents, and the Ombudsman's jurisdiction extends to many pension arrangements that are not subject to the levy. Since April 2005, the holder of the office of Pensions Ombudsman has also acted as the Ombudsman for the Pension Protection Fund, and in that capacity also deals with appeals against decisions made by the Financial Assistance Scheme, established by the Government to provide assistance to those whose pensions have been lost due to an employer going into liquidation. As with other ombudsmen services, the Pensions Ombudsman has been accused of both being biased towards complainants and being biased towards the companies that pay the levy. However, the levy is a statutory requirement which pension schemes have to pay anyway. There have also been criticisms of the appeal process, which involves the cost of action in the higher courts, and the legalistic approach to casework. ==References== ==External links== *Official Site Category:1991 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Department for Work and Pensions Category:Non-departmental public bodies of the United Kingdom government Category:Pensions in the United Kingdom Category:Ombudsmen in the United Kingdom ","title":"Pensions Ombudsman"},{"id":"7789880","text":"Count was a statesman in Meiji period Japan. He was a protégé of the leading oligarch Itō Hirobumi .As cabinet secretary 1892-1898, he was a powerbroker between the oligarchy and the political powers in the Diet. He grew increasingly conservative and became a watchdog and defender of the constitution in his role as privy councillor, 1899-1934. Biographer George Akita calls him a political failure.George Akita, \\"The Other Itō: A Political Failure.\\" in Albert Craig, ed. Personality in Japanese History (1970): 335-72. ==Biography== Itō was born into a local samurai administrator's family in Nagasaki, Hizen Province (present-day Nagasaki Prefecture). From his early days, he showed a mastery of foreign languages. In the new Meiji government he worked as a translation official for Hyōgo Prefecture specializing in English, and was later selected to accompany Itō Hirobumi (no relation--the Chinese characters for their names being different) to Europe in 1882 to investigate the constitutions and governmental structures of various European counties, with the aim of creating a constitution for Japan. After his return to Japan, he assisted Inoue Kowashi and Kaneko Kentarō in drafting the Meiji Constitution, and was subsequently nominated to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan. In 1892, he became Chief Cabinet Secretary in Itō Hirobumi's second administration, and in 1898, served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce under the third Itō administration. At the same time, Itō Miyoji was also president of the pro-government newspaper, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun (the predecessor to the modern Mainichi Shimbun). From 1899, Itō Miyoji served as a member of the Privy Council. In 1907, he was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. He was further elevated to hakushaku (count) in 1922. In his later years, Itō was the bane of civilian government through his consistent and conservative use of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun to inflame public opinion. During the Shōwa financial crisis, he brought out the collapse of the administration of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō through a virulent bad-press campaign. He also strongly criticized Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi for signing the London Naval Treaty on arms limitations as infringing on the direct prerogatives of the emperor. Itō died in 1934. His grave is at Tsukiji Hongan-ji in Tokyo. ==References and further reading== * Akita, George. \\"The Other Itō: A Political Failure.\\" in Albert Craig, ed.Personality in Japanese History (1970): 335-72. *Gordon, Andrew.

They are here placed in the tribe Melitaeini of subfamily Nymphalinae; some authors elevate this tribe to subfamily rank. As delimited here, Melitaea includes the genus Mellicta, making the subtribe Melitaeina monotypic (but see below). For long, it was believed that Mellicta was a junior objective synonym of Melitaea, sharing the same type species (the Glanville fritillary, M. cinxia). This was in error, however; the type species of Mellicta is actually the heath fritillary (M. athalia), making the two taxa junior subjective synonyms and thus eligible to be separated again. However, several other taxa are in fact objective synonyms (or at least have type specimens belonging to the same biological species) of Melitaea and Mellicta – Schoenis and the preoccupied Lucina and Melinaea for the former, Athaliaeformia for the latter.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004ab), FE (2009), and see references in Haaramo (2010, 2011) == Taxonomy == Melitaea didymoides pekinensis, belonging to the large didyma group Melitaea solona evadne (minerva group) Adult male Melitaea punica (phoebe group) As noted above, Mellicta is considered to be a subgenus of Melitaea for the time being. The rationale is that even though the Melitaeina may not be monotypic, they do not seem to consist of just two genera (Melitaea and Mellicta) either, and recognition of Mellicta appears to leave Melitaea paraphyletic; consequently, other lineages would need elevation to distinct genus status also. As long as it is not fully known which species groups and/or subgenera warrant recognition as full genera, they are all retained in the present genus. === Species === In the following list, species- group/subgenus affiliation and type species are annotated.

The school also offers part-time and holiday courses in the performing arts. The school had been accredited by Drama UK (organization dissolved in 2016), and it offers Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recognised qualifications validated by the City University London or Trinity College, London. ArtsEd is one of twenty-one specialist performing arts schools approved to offer government-funded Dance and Drama Awards, a scheme established to subsidise the cost of professional dance and drama training for the most talented students at leading institutions.Gov.uk: Dance and Drama 10023485 In 2013 ArtsEd was awarded a grant by the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation to fund a refurbishment project. The money was spent on the main theatre, costume storage, the School of Film and Television and the school's access facilities. In 2015 the school was rated \\"Outstanding\\" by Ofsted. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools. ==History== ArtsEd originated from two schools: one founded in 1919 by Grace Cone, the other in 1922 by Olive Ripman. Both offered curricula combining a general academic education with training in dance, drama, music and art, in preparation for professional careers in or connected with the theatre. In 1939 the two schools amalgamated to form the Cone Ripman School, later named the Arts Educational Schools. The school was first based at Stratford Place in London, but following the outbreak of World War II, relocated to Tring, Hertfordshire, sharing premises with Rothschild Bank at Tring Park. In 1941, the school reopened at Stratford Place, while the second school continued to operate in Tring. In 1947, both schools were renamed the Arts Educational Schools. The London school was later based at Golden Lane House in the Barbican until 1986 when the school purchased the former buildings of Acton and Chiswick Polytechnic. This building is now known as Cone Ripman House. In the 2000s the two schools became independent of each other, and the Tring school has been renamed Tring Park School for the Performing Arts. Today, Arts Educational Schools London is a co–educational Independent Day School and Sixth Form for pupils aged 11–18, and a professional conservatoire specialising in acting and musical theatre, as well as a range of part-time courses. For many years, the president of the school was prima ballerina assoluta Dame Alicia Markova and Dame Beryl Grey became Director in the 1960s. Dame Alicia was succeeded in 2007 by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Iain Reid was dean of the schools from 1999 until his retirement in December 2006. He was succeeded by John Baraldi, former chief executive of Riverside Studios, and former director of the East 15 Acting School; Baraldi left the school in early 2009, and was succeeded by Jane Harrison.

Photo by Ernest Brooks. A periscope rifle is a rifle that has been adapted to enable it to be sighted by the use of a periscope. This enables the shooter to remain concealed below cover. The device was independently invented by a number of individuals in response to the trench warfare conditions of the First World War, and while it is not clear which army was the first to use periscope rifles, the weapons were in use by the end of 1914. Similar devices were also built for use with machine guns.Saunders, Anthony (2000). p. 100. In 1916, another similar device was patented for use with pistols. ==Youlten hyposcope== A Mark II Youlten’s Patent Hyposcope in use with a Vickers gun, near Baghdad (1917) The first periscope sighting rifle attachment was the Youlten hyposcope invented by W. Youlten. An early version of the attachment was tested in 1903, receiving its first patent in 1914. Its maximum range was . ==Beech's periscope rifle== A form of periscope rifle was invented in May 1915 during the Gallipoli campaign by an Australian soldier, Lance Corporal, later Sergeant, William Beech (1875-1929), a builder's foreman in civilian life. At the time Beech was serving in the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The device allowed a soldier to aim and fire a rifle from a trench, without being exposed to enemy fire. Beech modified a standard Lee–Enfield .303 rifle by cutting the stock in half. The two halves were re- connected with a board and mirror periscope, horizontally aligned to the sights of the rifle, as well as a string to pull the trigger, which allowed the rifle to be fired from beneath the line of fire. According to the testimony of John Adams, a private who served with Beech, the idea came to Beech after the traumatic experience of seeing the bodies of fellow soldiers shot through the head. William Beech with his creation, May 1915. Beech's device was quickly copied by other members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). It saw extensive use in the intense trench warfare of Gallipoli, where some lines of trenches – such as at Quinn's Post – were within of one another. According to a Gallipoli campaign participant, Sir David G. Ferguson, the use of conventional rifles during daytime was abandoned in favour of periscope rifles. It was generally regarded as significantly less accurate than a conventional Lee–Enfield, although the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 states it was accurate to . A test conducted on the TV documentary series The Boffin, the Builder and the Bombardier suggested that the effective range was approximately .Ou, Serge (director). (21 March 2013). \\"Episode 1: Hit Without Being Hit\\", The Boffin, The Builder, The Bombardier, Bearcage Productions. However, during the Gallipoli campaign, a reduced effective range was not a significant problem as in many sectors, the Turkish and Allied trenches were close together. Some were only five yards apart. Periscope rifles were later manufactured in crude production lines on the beach at Anzac Cove. Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood described the invention as one of considerable importance during the Gallipoli campaign. In 1921, the British War Office awarded Beech £100 for the invention (around £ in 2015, when adjusted for inflation). ==Other World War I rifles== An Elder-type periscope stock fitted to an American M1903 Springfield rifle (1918); the rifle is also fitted with a 25-round magazine Two Lee–Enfield periscope adaptations were patented in September 1915. The first by J.E. Chandler was able to fire a full magazine before being dismounted. The second by G. Gerard was of a similar design. This was followed by E.C. Robert Marks's design in 1916, and the patents of M.E. Reginald and S.J. Young in 1918. On the Western Front periscope rifles were used by the Belgian, British and French armies. A periscope version of the Mosin–Nagant rifle was used by the Imperial Russian Army on the Eastern Front. A number of periscope rifles including the \\"Elder\\" and the \\"Cameron-Yaggi\\" were devised in the United States. The Cameron-Yaggi was invented in 1914, but development of the model came to an end after the Armistice in November 1918. The Cameron-Yaggi mounting required no permanent alteration to the fitted rifle, and included a mechanism to operate the rifle's bolt. The aiming periscope also functioned as a 4-power telescopic sight. However only around 12 were constructed. The M1903 Springfield rifle could be fitted with an enlarged magazine with 25 rounds, and both the Cameron-Yaggi and the Elder systems made use of this, so as many shots as possible could be fired without needing to dismount the rifle below the trench parapet for reloading. A Dutch version, known as the M.95 Loopgraafgeweer (Trench gun) was based on the Dutch Mannlicher service rifle. It saw service with the Royal Netherlands Army from 1916 until World War II. Another example was the Guiberson periscope rifle stock. ==See also== * Technology during World War I * Loophole (firearm) ===Similar weapons=== * CornerShot * Krummlauf * POF Eye ==References== ==External links== *Archive footage demonstrating the use of Beech's periscope rifle *Archive footage of a periscope mount for a Lewis gun being demonstrated Category:Rifles Category:Trench warfare Category:Military equipment of World War I ","title":"Periscope rifle"},{"id":"7790073","text":"The Rear of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (RAF-RF) (), often referred to in English as the rear services, is an organization of support services for the Russian Armed Forces.

He is most famous for having won the Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Heinrich Rohrer in 1986 for the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope. ==Early life and education== Binnig was born in Frankfurt am Main and played in the ruins of the city during his childhood. His family lived partly in Frankfurt and partly in Offenbach am Main, and he attended school in both cities. At the age of 10, he decided to become a physicist, but he soon wondered whether he had made the right choice. He concentrated more on music, playing in a band. He also started playing the violin at 15 and played in his school orchestra. Binnig studied physics at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt, gaining a bachelor's degree in 1973 and remaining there to do a PhD with in Werner Martienssen's group, supervised by Eckhardt Hoenig. ==Career== In 1978, Binnig accepted an offer from IBM to join their Zürich research group, where he worked with Heinrich Rohrer, Christoph Gerber and Edmund Weibel. There they developed the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level. The Nobel committee described the effect that the invention of the STM had on science, saying that \\"entirely new fields are opening up for the study of the structure of matter.\\" The physical principles on which the STM was based were already known before the IBM team developed the STM, but Binnig and his colleagues were the first to solve the significant experimental challenges involved in putting it into effect. The IBM Zürich team were soon recognized with a number of prizes: the German Physics Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize and the King Faisal Prize. In 1986, Binnig and Rohrer shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half of the Prize was awarded to Ernst Ruska. From 1985-1988, he worked in California. He was at IBM in Almaden Valley, and was visiting professor at Stanford University. In 1985, Binnig invented the atomic force microscope (AFM)G. Binnig, \\"Atomic force microscope and method for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution\\", US Patent US4724318 (priority date Nov 25 1985) and Binnig, Christoph Gerber and Calvin Quate went on to develop a working version of this new microscope for insulating surfaces. In 1987 Binnig was appointed IBM Fellow. In the same year, he started the IBM Physics group Munich, working on creativity.G. Binnig, \\"Aus dem Nichts. Über die Kreativität von Natur und Mensch\\", Piper (1990). and atomic force microscopy. In 1994 Professor Gerd Binnig founded Definiens which turned in the year 2000 into a commercial enterprise. The company developed Cognition Network Technology to analyze images just like the human eye and brain are capable of doing. in 2016, Binnig won the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience. He became a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center, an IBM-owned research facility in Rüschlikon, Zürich is named after Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer. ==Personal life== In 1969, Binnig married Lore Wagler, a psychologist, and they have a daughter born in Switzerland and a son born in California.

At the 1930 British Empire Games he finished fourth in the high jump event. He competed for Canada in the 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, United States, in the high jump where he won the gold medal. Bob Van Osdel, who took home the silver medal, was a close friend and teammate from the University of Southern California. Van Osdel helped coach McNaughton to his win during the final minutes of the competition. Later, in 1933 when McNaughton's medal was stolen from his car, Van Osdel—then a dentist—made a replica to replace it with a cast of his silver medal. The men remained friends until Van Osdel's death in 1987; McNaughton stayed in contact with his widow until his death in 1998. McNaughton studied geology at the University of Southern California and went on to receive a Master's degree from the California Institute of Technology. He worked for the Geological Survey of Canada, then explored for oil in South America and later served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He received a PhD in geology from USC and was also an assistant professor of geology there. McNaughton later helped initiate oil and gas exploration in the Amadeus Basin of central Australia and Palm Valley.

It is usually aimed at one or more 'target' synovial joints with the aim of achieving a therapeutic effect. == Practice of manipulation == A modern re- emphasis on manipulative therapy occurred in the late 19th century in North America with the emergence of osteopathic medicine and chiropractic medicine. In the context of healthcare, joint manipulation is performed by several professional groups. In North America and Europe, joint manipulation is most commonly performed by chiropractors (estimated to perform over 90% of all manipulative treatments), American-trained osteopathic physicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and European osteopaths. When applied to joints in the spine, it is referred to as spinal manipulation. == Terminology == Manipulation is known by several other names. Historically, general practitioners and orthopaedic surgeons have used the term \\"manipulation\\".Burke, G.L., \\"Backache from Occiput to Coccyx\\" Chapter 7 Chiropractors refer to manipulation of a spinal joint as an 'adjustment'. Following the labelling system developed by Geoffery Maitland,Maitland, G.D. Peripheral Manipulation 2nd ed. Butterworths, London, 1977. Maitland, G.D. Vertebral Manipulation 5th ed. Butterworths, London, 1986. manipulation is synonymous with Grade V mobilization, a term commonly used by physical therapists. Because of its distinct biomechanics (see section below), the term high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust is often used interchangeably with manipulation. == Biomechanics == Manipulation can be distinguished from other manual therapy interventions such as joint mobilization by its biomechanics, both kinetics and kinematics. === Kinetics === Until recently, force-time histories measured during spinal manipulation were described as consisting of three distinct phases: the preload (or prethrust) phase, the thrust phase, and the resolution phase. Evans and Breen added a fourth 'orientation' phase to describe the period during which the patient is oriented into the appropriate position in preparation for the prethrust phase. When individual peripheral synovial joints are manipulated, the distinct force-time phases that occur during spinal manipulation are not as evident. In particular, the rapid rate of change of force that occurs during the thrust phase when spinal joints are manipulated is not always necessary. Most studies to have measured forces used to manipulate peripheral joints, such as the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, show no more than gradually increasing load. This is probably because there are many more tissues restraining a spinal motion segment than an independent MCP joint. === Kinematics === The kinematics of a complete spinal motion segment when one of its constituent spinal joints are manipulated are much more complex than the kinematics that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral synovial joint. Even so, the motion that occurs between the articular surfaces of any individual synovial joint during manipulation should be very similar and is described below. Early models describing the kinematics of an individual target joint during the various phases of manipulation (notably Sandoz 1976) were based on studies that investigated joint cracking in MCP joints. The cracking was elicited by pulling the proximal phalanx away from the metacarpal bone (to separate, or 'gap' the articular surfaces of the MCP joint) with gradually increasing force until a sharp resistance, caused by the cohesive properties of synovial fluid, was met and then broken. These studies were therefore never designed to form models of therapeutic manipulation, and the models formed were erroneous in that they described the target joint as being configured at the end range of a rotation movement, during the orientation phase. The model then predicted that this end range position was maintained during the prethrust phase until the thrust phase where it was moved beyond the 'physiologic barrier' created by synovial fluid resistance; conveniently within the limits of anatomical integrity provided by restraining tissues such as the joint capsule and ligaments. This model still dominates the literature. However, after re-examining the original studies on which the kinematic models of joint manipulation were based, Evans and Breen argued that the optimal prethrust position is actually the equivalent of the neutral zone of the individual joint, which is the motion region of the joint where the passive osteoligamentous stability mechanisms exert little or no influence. This new model predicted that the physiologic barrier is only confronted when the articular surfaces of the joint are separated (gapped, rather than the rolling or sliding that usually occurs during physiological motion), and that it is more mechanically efficient to do this when the joint is near to its neutral configuration. == Cracking joints == Joint manipulation is characteristically associated with the production of an audible 'clicking' or 'popping' sound. This sound is believed to be the result of a phenomenon known as cavitation occurring within the synovial fluid of the joint. When a manipulation is performed, the applied force separates the articular surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint. This deforms the joint capsule and intra-articular tissues, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low pressure environment, some of the gases that are dissolved in the synovial fluid (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave solution creating a bubble or cavity, which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a 'clicking' sound. The contents of this gas bubble are thought to be mainly carbon dioxide. The effects of this process will remain for a period of time termed the 'refractory period', which can range from a few minutes to more than an hour, while it is slowly reabsorbed back into the synovial fluid. There is some evidence that ligament laxity around the target joint is associated with an increased probability of cavitation. == Clinical effects and mechanisms of action == The clinical effects of joint manipulation have been shown to include: * Temporary relief of musculoskeletal pain. * Shortened time to recover from acute back sprains (Rand). * Temporary increase in passive range of motion (ROM). * Physiological effects upon the central nervous system. * No alteration of the position of the sacroiliac joint. Common side effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort. Shekelle (1994) summarised the published theories for mechanism(s) of action for how joint manipulation may exert its clinical effects as the following: * Release of entrapped synovial folds or plica * Relaxation of hypertonic muscle * Disruption of articular or periarticular adhesions * Unbuckling of motion segments that have undergone disproportionate displacement == Safety issues == As with all interventions, there are risks associated with joint manipulation, especially manipulation of spinal joints. Infrequent, but potentially serious side effects, include: vertebrobasilar accidents (VBA), strokes, spinal disc herniation, vertebral and rib fractures, and cauda equina syndrome. In a 1993 study, J.D. Cassidy, DC, and co-workers concluded that the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disk herniation by side posture manipulation is \\"both safe and effective.\\" In a 2019 study, L.M. Mabry, PT, and colleagues reported joint manipulation adverse events to be rare. === Risks of upper cervical manipulation === The degree of serious risks associated with manipulation of the cervical spine is uncertain, with widely differing results being published. A 2008 study in the journal \\"Spine\\", JD Cassidy, E Boyle, P Cote', Y He, et al. investigated 818 VBA strokes that were hospitalized in a population of more than 100 million person-years. In those aged <45 years, cases were about three times more likely to see a chiropractor or a PCP before their stroke than controls. Results were similar in the case control and case cross over analyses. There was no increased association between chiropractic visits and VBA stroke in those older than 45 years. Positive associations were found between PCP visits and VBA stroke in all age groups. The study concluded that VBA stroke is a very rare event in the population. The increased risks of VBA stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke. The study found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care. A 1996 Danish chiropractic study confirmed the risk of stroke to be low, and determined that the greatest risk is with manipulation of the first two vertebra of the cervical spine, particularly passive rotation of the neck, known as the \\"master cervical\\" or \\"rotary break.\\" Serious complications after manipulation of the cervical spine are estimated to be 1 in 4 million manipulations or fewer.Lauretti W \\"What are the risk of chiropractic neck treatments?\\" retrieved online 08 028 2006 from www.chiro.org A RAND Corporation extensive review estimated \\"one in a million.\\"Coulter ID, Hurwitz EL, Adams AH, et al.

Chiropractic therapy: diagnosis and treatment (English translation). Rockville, Md: Aspen Publishers, 1990: 61. After an extensive literature review performed to formulate practice guidelines, the authors concurred that \\"the risk of serious neurological complications (from cervical manipulation) is extremely low, and is approximately one or two per million cervical manipulations.\\"Haldeman S, Chapman-Smith D, Petersen DM. Guidelines for chiropractic quality assurance and practice parameters. Gaithersburg, Md: Aspen Publishers, 1993: 170-2. In comparison, there is a 3-4% rate of complications for cervical spinal surgery, and 4,000-10,000 deaths per million neck surgeries.The cervical spine research society editorial committee. The Cervical Spine, Second edition. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company 1990: 834. Understandably, vascular accidents are responsible for the major criticism of spinal manipulative therapy. However, it has been pointed out that \\"critics of manipulative therapy emphasize the possibility of serious injury, especially at the brain stem, due to arterial trauma after cervical manipulation. It has required only the very rare reporting of these accidents to malign a therapeutic procedure that, in experienced hands, gives beneficial results with few adverse side effects\\".Kleynhans AM, Terrett AG. Cerebrovascular complications of manipulation. In: Haldeman S, ed. Principles and practice of chiropractic, 2nd ed. East Norwalk, CT, Appleton Lang, 1992. In very rare instances, the manipulative adjustment to the cervical spine of a vulnerable patient becomes the final intrusive act which results in a very serious consequence. === Potential for incident underreporting === Statistics on the reliability of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Prof Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, but none of the cases had been reported. He concluded that underreporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates \\"nonsensical.\\" He therefore suggested that \\"clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element.\\" The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection.NHS Evaluation of the evidence base for the adverse effects of spinal manipulation by chiropractors Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey method of data collection. A 2001 study in the journal Stroke found that vertebrobasilar accidents (VBAs) were five times more likely in those aged less than 45 years who had visited a chiropractor in the preceding week, compared to controls who had not visited a chiropractor. No significant associations were found for those over 45 years. The authors concluded: \\"While our analysis is consistent with a positive association in young adults... The rarity of VBAs makes this association difficult to study despite high volumes of chiropractic treatment.\\" Original article The NHS notes that this study collected data objectively by using administrative data, involving less recall bias than survey studies, but the data were collected retrospectively and probably contained inaccuracies. In 1996, Coulter et al. had a multidisciplinary group of 4 MDs, 4 DCs and 1 MD/DC look at 736 conditions where it was used. Their job was to evaluate the appropriateness of manipulation or mobilization of the cervical spine in those cases (including a few cases not performed by chiropractors). \\"According to the report ... 57.6% of reported indications for cervical manipulation was considered inappropriate, with 31.3% uncertain. Only 11.1% could be labeled appropriate. A panel of chiropractors and medical practitioners concluded that '. . . much additional scientific data about the efficacy of cervical spine manipulation are needed.'\\" === Misattribution problems === Studies of stroke and manipulation do not always clearly identify what professional has performed the manipulation. In some cases this has led to confusion and improper placement of blame. In a 1995 study, chiropractic researcher Allan Terrett, DC, pointed to this problem: :\\"The words chiropractic and chiropractor have been incorrectly used in numerous publications dealing with SMT injury by medical authors, respected medical journals and medical organizations. In many cases, this is not accidental; the authors had access to original reports that identified the practitioner involved as a nonchiropractor. The true incidence of such reporting cannot be determined. Such reporting adversely affects the reader's opinion of chiropractic and chiropractors.\\" This error was taken into account in a 1999 review of the scientific literature on the risks and benefits of manipulation of the cervical spine (MCS). Special care was taken, whenever possible, to correctly identify all the professions involved, as well as the type of manipulation responsible for any injuries and/or deaths. It analyzed 177 cases that were reported in 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997, and summarized: : \\"The most frequently reported injuries involved arterial dissection or spasm, and lesions of the brain stem. Death occurred in 32 (18%) of the cases. Physical therapists were involved in less than 2% of the cases, and no deaths have been attributed to MCS provided by physical therapists. Although the risk of injury associated with MCS appears to be small, this type of therapy has the potential to expose patients to vertebral artery damage that can be avoided with the use of mobilization (nonthrust passive movements).\\" In Figure 1 in the review, the types of injuries attributed to manipulation of the cervical spine are shown, and Figure 2 shows the type of practitioner involved in the resulting injury. For the purpose of comparison, the type of practitioner was adjusted according to the findings by Terrett. The review concluded: : \\"The literature does not demonstrate that the benefits of MCS outweigh the risks. Several recommendations for future studies and for the practice of MCS are discussed.\\" Edzard Ernst has written: :\\"...there is little evidence to demonstrate that spinal manipulation has any specific therapeutic effects. On the other hand, there is convincing evidence to show that it is associated with frequent, mild adverse effects as well as with serious complications of unknown incidence. Therefore, it seems debatable whether the benefits of spinal manipulation outweigh its risks. Specific risk factors for vascular accidents related to spinal manipulation have not been identified, which means that any patient may be at risk, particularly those below 45 years of age. Definitive, prospective studies that can overcome the limitations of previous investigations are now a matter of urgency. Until they are available, clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element.\\" == Emergency medicine == In emergency medicine joint manipulation can also refer to the process of bringing fragments of fractured bone or dislocated joints into normal anatomical alignment (otherwise known as 'reducing' the fracture or dislocation). These procedures have no relation to the HVLA thrust procedure. == See also == * Orthopedic medicine * Osteopathic manipulative medicine * Physical therapy * Small joint manipulation == References == == Further reading == * Cyriax, J.

He enjoyed a carefree country childhood until the family moved to Zürich in 1949. He enrolled in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in 1951, where he was student of Wolfgang Pauli and Paul Scherrer. His PhD thesis was supervised by Prof P. Grassmann who worked on cryogenic engineering. Rohrer measured the length changes of superconductors at the magnetic-field-induced superconducting transition, a project begun by Jørgen Lykke Olsen. In the course of his research, he found that he had to do most of his research at night after the city was asleep because his measurements were so sensitive to vibration. His studies were interrupted by his military service in the Swiss mountain infantry. In 1961, he married Rose-Marie Egger. Their honeymoon trip to the United States included a stint doing research on thermal conductivity of type-II superconductors and metals with Bernie Serin at Rutgers University in New Jersey. In 1963, he joined the IBM Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon under the direction of Ambros Speiser. The first couple of years at IBM, he studied Kondo systems with magnetoresistance in pulsed magnetic fields. He then began studying magnetic phase diagrams, which eventually brought him into the field of critical phenomena. In 1974, he spent a sabbatical year at the University of California in Santa Barbara, California studying nuclear magnetic resonance with Vince Jaccarino and Alan King. Until 1982 he worked on the scanning tunneling microscope. He was appointed IBM Fellow in 1986, and led the physics department of the research lab from 1986 until 1988.

In March 2007, Bridget Prentice, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice stated in a written answer in the House of Commons \\"...there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence.\\", \\"There are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only...\\" and that \\" There is no special status for legislation which applies to Cornwall or to Cornish localities.\\" This was also confirmed in a reply to a question posed by the MP Andrew George in May 2009.Andrew George: To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the answer of 29 March 2007, Official Report, column 1673, on politics and government: South West region, whether any parts of Stannary Law still exist as part of the law of England and Wales. [276568] Mr. Wills: The body of Stannary customary law has not been systematically repealed. It is likely however that such customary law has been superseded by modern legislation. There were also provisions in 19th century primary legislation relating to the stannaries, but these have largely been repealed. House of Commons- Written Answers – 20 May 2009 : Column 1449W , ==History== On 20 May 1974, a pressure group, claiming to be a \\"revived\\" Cornish Stannary Parliament, assembled in Lostwithiel. The group interpreted the 1508 charter as applying to all descendants of Cornish tin- miners, and claimed that they had the power to veto all laws made in Westminster, not only those relating to the tin and mineral industries. The meeting was primarily called in response to a crisis in the china clay industry. Employers in the industry had been forbidden by the Pay Board from paying their 9,000 workers the higher wages agreed under a productivity deal. The Lord Warden of the Stannaries, Geoffrey Waldegrave, 12th Earl Waldegrave refused an invitation to open the parliament.\\"Cornishmen show teeth in reviving a parliament\\", Trevor Fishlock, The Times, 21 May 1974 On 24 June, at a meeting at which the stannators wore kilts of Cornish tartan, and at which an unofficial Cornish national anthem was sung, the group proclaimed eighteen articles or acts, including the claim to retain all taxes gathered in the Duchy, the declaration of St Piran's flag to be the national flag, a claim on all mineral rights including oil and natural gas, and sought to reverse recent local government reorganisation. A petition was sent to the Queen declaring that if she did not recognise the parliament they would seize crown lands and properties. They also sought recognition from the United Nations.\\"Why Cornishmen are nailing their colours to Magna Carta\\", Susanne Puddefoot, The Times 26 October 1974 On 12 December 1974, the Home Office replied to the petition, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. On 15 December, Brian Hambley, using the title \\"Lord Protector of the Stannaries\\", said they had decided to postpone the seizure of property in St Austell to give the four town councils an opportunity to appoint stannators. Hambley claimed there was a constitutional crisis and that should be done \\"immediately to avoid political anarchy\\". The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament next hit the headlines in 1978, again at St Austell Magistrate's Court. Hambley had been charged with having failed to pay motor tax and displaying the stannary seal in place of a tax disc. His defence was that he was exempt from the court's jurisdiction because he was a \\"privileged tinner\\", having staked out several acres of moorland, with a view to working them for tin on land belonging to the lord-lieutenant of the county. After two and a half hours consultation, the magistrates agreed they had no jurisdiction.\\"Ancient tin miners' parliament wins its challenge in a 1978 magistrate's court\\", The Times, 16 June 1978 The following day a court in Bodmin adjourned a similar case sine die against Frederick Trull.\\"Victories for Stannary Parliament seen as a giant leap for Cornwall\\", The Times, 17 June 1978 On 11 July, the county court (which had the powers of the old stannary courts, under the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896), declared that the lands Hambley claimed to have staked were already bounded, and ordered him to pay the landowners' costs.\\"Cornishman may appeal over tin mining ruling\\", The Times, 12 July 1978 By the end of July, over a hundred people were refusing to pay road tax in Cornwall, but a decision of the High Court gave the Home Office leave to quash the original magistrate's decision.\\"Court move to stop revolt over road tax\\", The Times, 1 August 1978 The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament's next large campaign was in 1989, and related to the introduction of the unpopular community charge or poll tax. They claimed that, because the law imposing the charge had not been approved by the Stannary Parliament, \\"all tin-miners and former tin-miners, all descendants of tin-miners, all shareholders in tin-mines and anyone who supplied equipment for tin-mining\\" were exempt from the tax. Shares were made available for sale in the Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company at one pound each, the claim being that shareholders would not be liable for the charge. The company was owned by Frederick Trull, who had rejoined the group as its clerk.\\"Charter of 1508 is cited; Poll tax challenge\\", The Times, 29 August 1989 By March 1990, up to one and a quarter million applications for shares had been made. On 22 March, the Department of Trade and Industry was granted an injunction in the High Court freezing the company's assets, on the grounds that the company was not registered under the Companies Act 1985, and that Mr Trull was not authorised under the Financial Services Act 1986 to conduct investment business.\\"Cornish poll tax rebel barred\\", The Times, 23 March 1990 On 27 June, the company was placed in receivership, with shareholders potentially facing the payment of costs.\\"Tin mine investors face costs; Royal Cornish Consols United Tin Mines Cost Book Company\\", The Times, 28 June 1990 On 5 September, the receiver announced that Trull had vanished and that there was no trace of the estimated £1 million paid by members of the public.\\"Founder of firm that offered poll-tax immunity is missing\\", The Times, 5 September 1990 On 12 October, Trull was found guilty of contempt by breaching High Court orders to stop issuing shares, and for failing to disclose the whereabouts of the money. He was sentenced in his absence to six months imprisonment. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Harman, said \\"The matter may be based on a genuine belief by Mr Trull in the privileges of Cornish tin miners but has all the appearance of being a con trick.\\"\\"Tin mining 'conman' is jailed for six months\\", The Times, 13 October 1990 On 22 February 1991, Trull appeared before the High Court, and his sentence was reduced to three months and suspended for two years, on the condition that he undertook to help the Department of Trade and Industry recover the money invested by the public. Trull's counsel told the court that the money had gone to \\"the sharks of this world\\" and that Trull was \\"fired not by dishonesty, but by obsessive belief in the Stannary laws\\".\\"Jail term suspended\\", The Times, 23 February 1991\\"Cornish tin men's reluctant farewell\\". The Times, 27 February 1991 Trull remained clerk of the \\"revived\\" parliament, and in November was again before the courts claiming the Bodmin magistrates had no jurisdiction to make orders for payment against him on behalf of Restormel Borough Council, because he was 'a privileged tinner within the Stannaries of Cornwall.' The case was finally settled against Trull in 1994. ==Operation Chough== In 1999 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament started a direct action campaign they called \\"Operation Chough\\". The organisation wrote to English Heritage demanding it remove all signs bearing the \\"English Heritage\\" title from sites it managed in Cornwall by 31 July.Cornwall heritage warning, The Times, 26 April 1999 Over eleven months, eighteen signs were removed from sites in Cornwall including Carn Euny, Chysauster, Pendennis Castle and Tintagel. The \\"Keeper of the Seal of the Stannary Parliament\\" wrote to English Heritage saying \\"The signs have been confiscated and held as evidence of English cultural aggression in Cornwall. Such racially motivated signs are deeply offensive and cause distress to many Cornish people\\". On 18 January 2002, at Truro Crown Court, three members of the group agreed to return the signs and pay £4,500 in compensation to English Heritage and to be bound over to keep the peace. In return, the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy to cause criminal damage.\\"How three Cornish men and a raid on King Arthur's castle rocked English Heritage\\" The Guardian 19 January 2002 The case was unusual as a public-interest immunity certificate was presented to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service about ten minutes into the hearing. This prevented some defence evidence from being heard. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament believed the reason for the introduction of the PII certificate was that the Duchy of Cornwall refuses to reveal the circumstances under which it transferred several of its properties (including Tintagel Castle) to the management of English Heritage. == Elections== Elections to Revived Cornish Stannary are from among the Cornish Stannary Community. To be a member of the Cornish Stannary Community you have to declare that \\"I am Cornish as one of my parents is of direct indigenous Cornish descent or I am Cornish by marriage, and that therefore, I consider myself to be an \\"heir and successor\\" of the Cornish Stannary Community who secured the Charter of Pardon from King Henry VII in 1508\\". The elected officers of the Cornish Stannary Parliament are not published. There is a further organisation attached to CSP, known as the Cornish Citizens Association which has a more inclusive membership policy not based on race. ==RCSP claims== The RCSP campaigned against the lack of a written constitutional text to protect British 'subjects' from abuse of power by the state and have highlighted the absence of a British constitutional/statutory guarantee of the principle of equality before the law (cf Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). They raised concerns with the British government regarding the failure by the state to include Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights in its Human Rights Act 1998, the failure by the state to ratify Protocol 12 of the ECHR, the failure by the state to incorporate the European Directive 2000/43/EC on Anti-discrimination into domestic legislation by introducing what the RCSP claim is the inadequate Statutory Instrument 1626. They have also raised concerns regarding the retention of an unelected head of state and associated upper chamber of parliament (House of Lords), and the retention of what the RCSP calls an archaic and undemocratic Privy Council of the United Kingdom. The RCSP asserts that Cornish people are subject to forced assimilation by an education system that fails to provide them with an adequate level of knowledge about their history and, hence, their identity. They also claimed that there are persistent attempts by state authorities to deny Cornish people their identity, for example, in the national census, pupil level annual school census, exclusion from the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and denial of adequate financial cultural/linguistic resources. The organisation's website says that the group has been active in seeking repayment of alleged over-taxation on tin mined in Cornwall, and to have lodged documents with the European Court of Human Rights. ==Other activities== In 2007 the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament presented at Truro Crown Court having put together a demand to restrict the 'rights and privileges' of the Duke of Cornwall, The Prince of Wales, in his role within the Duchy However the judge dismissed the case, saying the RCSP were in the wrong court. * The RCSP campaigned, along with other Cornish organisations, for the Cornish to be recognised by the UK government under the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. * The RCSP says it campaigned, along with Mebyon Kernow and other Cornish organisations for the inclusion of a Cornish tick box on the 2011 Census, although this was not successful and the forms as issued did not include a Cornish tick box. For the first time the Cornish were allocated the '06' census code for the 2001 Census but there have been claims that the actual number of people registering as Cornish would have been much higher if a Cornish option tick box had been included. 37,500 people wrote that they had Cornish ethnicity on the 2001 census form. The RCSP said that many Cornish people were unaware of the new option and the figures would have been much higher if the tick-box was available. ==See also== *List of topics related to Cornwall *Cornish Nationalism *Cornwall 2000 ==References== ==External links== *Cornish ethnicity data from the 2001 Census (British Society for Population Studies Conference 2006) *BBC news 18 January 2002 – Historic signs case trio bound over * Cornish Stannary Banknotes, by Peter Symes Category:Political advocacy groups in England Category:Organisations based in Cornwall Category:Cornish nationalism ","title":"Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament"},{"id":"7790259","text":"Javkhede is a village in Jalgaon district, tehsil Amalner in state of Maharashtra, India.

He was one of the founding members of the Meirokusha with Mori Arinori, Nishimura Shigeki, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Kato Hiroyuki, Nakamura Masanao, and Nishi Amane. ==Early life== Tsuda was born into a local samurai household in Tsuyama Domain (present-day Okayama Prefecture). In his early days, he studied rangaku under Mitsukuri Gempo and military science under Sakuma Shozan. He became an instructor at the Bansho Shirabesho institute run by the Tokugawa bakufu to study western books and science. In 1862, he was selected, together with Nishi Amane, by the government for training in the Netherlands in western political science, constitutional law, and economics. They departed in 1863 with a Dutch physician Dr. J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort, who had set up the first teaching hospital for western medicine in Nagasaki. The two Japanese students were put in the care of Professor Simon Vissering, who taught Political Economy, Statistics and Diplomatic History at the University of Leyden. They developed a genuine friendship with Vissering who was conscious of the long- standing friendship between Japan and the Netherlands through Dejima. He felt that the students' desire for knowledge would make them likely future participation in Japan's modernization. Vissering, a member of La Vertu Lodge No, 7, Leyden introduced them to Freemasonry, of which they became the first Japanese adherents on October 20, 1864. ==Government career== After his return to Japan in 1868, Tsuda wrote the Kaisei Kokuho ron (On Western Law), which was the first book in Japanese on the subject. He was recruited by the new Meiji government and helped in the first codification of Japanese laws. In 1869, he drafted Japan's first laws prohibiting human trafficking, and the new national law code was promulgated in 1870. In 1871, he assisted the Foreign Ministry in negotiations with Qing dynasty China and accompanied Date Munenori to Beijing. He also served in the Genrōin and in the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan after the 1890 Japanese general election. Tsuda was also an active member of the Meirokusha, and contributed numerous articles to its journal. He was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. ==References and further reading== * Auslin, Michael R.

Here he studied from 1938 to 1945, obtaining his baccalaureate (Matura). Müller then enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich. He took courses by Wolfgang Pauli, who made a deep impression on him. After receiving his Diplom, he worked for one year, then returned to ETH for a PhD, submitting his thesis at the end of 1957. ==Career== Müller joined the Battelle Memorial Institute in Geneva, soon becoming the manager of a magnetic resonance group. During this time he became a lecturer at the University of Zürich. In 1963 he accepted an offer as a research staff member at the IBM Zürich Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon, where he remained until his retirement. In parallel, he maintained his affiliation with University of Zurich where he was appointed professor in 1970. From 1972 to 1985 Müller was manager of the ZRL physics department. In 1982 he became an IBM Fellow. He received an honorary doctorate from Technical University of Munich and University of Geneva. In 1987 (before winning the Nobel Prize) he got an honorary degree (laurea honoris causa) in Physics from the University of Pavia. ==Research== Müller in 2002 For his undergraduate diploma work, Müller studied under G. Busch. He worked on the Hall Effect in gray tin, a semimetal. Between his undergraduate degree and beginning his graduate studies, he worked for one year in the Department of Industrial Research at ETH on the Eidophor large-scale display system. At IBM his research for almost 15 years centered on SrTiO3 (strontium titanate) and related perovskite compounds. He studied their photochromic properties when doped with various transition-metal ions; their chemical binding, ferroelectric and soft-mode properties; and the critical and multicritical phenomena of their structural phase transitions. Important highlights of this research have been published in a book written together with Tom Kool from the University of Amsterdam (publisher: World Scientific). ==Nobel Prize–winning work== In the early 1980s, Müller began searching for substances that would become superconductive at higher temperatures. The highest critical temperature (Tc) attainable at that time was about 23 K. In 1983 Müller recruited Georg Bednorz to IBM, to help systematically test various oxides. A few recent studies had indicated these materials might superconduct. In 1986 the two succeeded in achieving superconductivity in lanthanum barium copper oxide (LBCO) at a temperature of 35 K. Over the previous 75 years the critical temperature had risen from 11 K in 1911 to 23 K in 1973 where it had remained for 13 years. Thus 35 K was incredibly high by the prevailing standards of superconductivity research. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in high- temperature superconductivity, leading to the discovery of compounds such as BSCCO (Tc = 107 K) and YBCO (T'c = 92 K). They reported their discovery in the June 1986 issue of Zeitschrift für Physik B. Before the end of the year, Shoji Tanaka at the University of Tokyo and then Paul Chu at the University of Houston had each independently confirmed their result. A couple of months later Chu achieved superconductivity at 93 K in YBCO, triggering a stampede of scientific interest exemplified by the 1987 \\"Woodstock of physics\\", at which Müller was a featured presenter. In 1987 Müller and Bednorz were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics—the shortest time between the discovery and the prize award for any scientific Nobel. ===Other Honors=== *Honorary degree, University of Pavia, 1987. *Honorary degree, dr. techn., Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 1992. == See also == * Timeline of low-temperature technology == References == * including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1987 Perovskite-Type Oxides – The New Approach to High-Tc Superconductivity * Online Encyclopædia Britannica biographical article. * K.

After refusing, because he had been offered more money by a rival gang to appear at their own club, \\"The New Rendezvous\\", he was assaulted in his 10th floor Commonwealth Hotel room, in November 1927, by three enforcers sent by McGurn. The enforcers, who included Sam Giancana and Leonard \\"Needles\\" Gianola, mutilated Lewis (his throat and tongue were cut) and left him for dead. It took him several years to be able to speak again. Capone, who was fond of Lewis, was displeased with the assault, but would not take action against one of his top lieutenants. He instead provided Lewis with $10,000 (equal to $ today) to recover properly and eventually resume his career.Weird Chicago: Legend Of The Green Mill Lewis toured in the USO shows with Ray Bolger in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Joe appeared in the movies Too Many Husbands (the 1931 short comedy), Private Number (1936), The Holy Terror (1937), Private Buckaroo (1942), and (playing himself) Lady in Cement (1968). He appeared frequently on The Ed Sullivan Show, was the \\"Mystery Guest\\" three different times on What's My Line, and was interviewed on Person to Person in 1956. In 1946 he married actress Martha Stewart; they divorced in 1948. Random House published Lewis's biography, The Joker Is Wild, written by Art Cohn, in 1955. Lewis and Frank Sinatra had a longtime friendship predating Sinatra's portrayal of the comedian in The Joker is Wild. In 1961 Sinatra signed Lewis to record for his label, Reprise Records. The result, It Is Now Post Time, is one of the first LPs released by Reprise, and one of the few recorded examples of Lewis at work as a stand-up comedian. The title references a well-known part of his act, holding up a drink on stage and saying “Post time!”. This is a horse racing term, meaning the race is about to start; its use here implies that the drinker is about to start on a long binge. On his live album Sinatra at the Sands (1966), Sinatra says that even though he recently celebrated his 50th birthday, he would have the body of a 22-year-old man, \\"if I hadn't spent all those years drinking with Joe E.

It was one of the first pulp magazines devoted to detective fiction and consisted of short stories and serials. While the publication was the publishing house's first detective-fiction pulp magazine in a format resembling a modern paperback (a \\"thick book\\" in dime- novel parlance), Street & Smith had only recently ceased publication of the dime-novel series Nick Carter Weekly, which concerned the adventures of a young detective. From February 21, 1931 to its demise, the magazine was titled Street & Smith's Detective Story Magazine. During half of its 34-year life, the magazine was popular enough to support weekly issues. Ludwig Wittgenstein, the eminent philosopher, was among the magazine's readership.Hard-boiled Wit: Ludwig Wittgenstein and Norbert Davis Retrieved 27th December 2011. ==Radio== Promotional photograph for The Detective Story Hour, with James La Curto as The Shadow (1930) Stories from the magazine were first heard on the radio on July 31, 1930.

As a result, Street & Smith debuted The Shadow Magazine on April 1, 1931, a pulp series created and primarily written by the prolific Walter B. Gibson. The success of The Shadow and Doc Savage also prompted Street & Smith to revive Nick Carter as a hero pulp that ran from 1933 to 1936.

Islam: An Introduction (Translation of: Der Islam). SUNY Press. . . p. 86 His book, Kitab al–Milal wa al-Nihal (lit. The Book of Sects and Creeds) was one of the pioneers in developing an objective and philosophical approach to the study of religions. ==Life== Very few things are known about al-Shahrastānī's life. He was born in 1086 CE A.H., in the town of Shahristān, (Khorasan, province of Persia) where he acquired his early traditional education. Later, he was sent to Nīshāpūr where he studied under different masters who were all disciples of the Ash\`ari theologian al-Juwaynī (d. 1085). At the age of thirty, al-Shahrastānī went to Baghdad to pursue theological studies and taught for three years at the prestigious Ash\`ari school, al-Nizāmiyya. Afterwards, he returned to Persia where he worked as Nā’ib (Deputy) of the chancellery for Sanjar, the Saljūq ruler of Khurāsān. At the end of his life, al-Shahrastānī went back to live in his native town, where he died in the year 1153. ==Works== Al-Shahrastani distinguished himself by his desire to describe in the most objective way the universal religious history of humanity.Watt 1991, p. 68. This is reflected in his Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal (The Book of Sects and Creeds), a monumental work, which presents the doctrinal points of view of all the religions and philosophies which existed up to his time. The book was one of the earliest systematic studies of religion, and is noted for its non-polemical style and scientific approach.Watt 1991, p. 68. A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by UNESCO (Livre des religions et des sectes. Peeters: 1986, 1993). Al-Shahrastani's philosophical and theological thoughts manifested in his other major works, which include: * The Nihayat al-aqdam fi 'ilm al-kalam (The End of Steps in the Science of Theology) presents different theological discussions and shows the limits of Muslim theology (kalam). * The Majlis is a discourse, written during the mature period of his life, delivered to a Twelver Shi\`ite audience. * The Musara\`at al-Falasifa (The Struggle with Philosophers) criticizes Ibn Sina (Avicenna)’s doctrines by emphasizing some peculiar Isma'ili arguments on the division of beings. * The Mafatih al-Asrar wa-masabih al-abrar (The Keys of the Mysteries and the Lamps of the Righteous) introduces the Qur’an and gives a complete commentary on the first two chapters of the Qur’an. ==Religious belief== Although self-identified and generally perceived as an Sunni-Ash'ari, as can be seen in his books, Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, and Nihayat al-Iqdam fi 'Ilm al-Kalam. A few of his contemporaries accused him of covertly being an Isma'ili. ==Christian commentary== In Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal, al- Shahrastani records a portrayal of Christianity very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative: > “The Christians. (They are) the community (umma) of the Christ, Jesus, son > of Mary (peace upon him). He it is who was truly sent (as prophet; mab'uth) > after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him > were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of > the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and > innate disposition (fitra) are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, > his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. > For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age > of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the > cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at > (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (da'wa) was > three years and three months and three days.”Watt 1991, p. 68. Al-Shahrastani also explains the differences between Christians in Kitab al- Milal wa al-Nihal regarding the incarnation (tajassud): > “They affirmed that God has three hypostases (aqanim). They said that the > Creator (may he be exalted) is one substance (jawhar), meaning by this what > is self-subsistent (al-qa'im bi-n-nafs), not (what is characterized by) > spatial location and physical magnitude; and he is one in substantiality, > three in hypostaticity (uqnumiyya). By the hypostases they mean the > attributes (sifat), such as existence, life and knowledge, and the father, > the son and the holy spirit (ruh al-qudus). The (hypostasis of) knowledge > clothes itself and was incarnated, but not the other hypostases.”Watt 1991, > p. 69. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== ; Works and studies in English * al-Shahrastānī, The Summa philosophiae, (Kitāb Nihāyatu ʼl-Iqdām fī ʽIlmi ʼl –Kalām), edited with a translation by Alfred Guillaume, London, Oxford University Press 1934. * Muhammad b.

It received attention in the UK after a fight was televised on Tarrant On TV, which has also led to its popularity growing on the internet via YouTube. ==References== Category:STS (TV channel) original programming Category:TNT (Russian TV channel) original programming Category:2000s Russian television series Category:2002 Russian television series debuts Category:2005 Russian television series endings Category:Russian television talk shows ","title":"Okna (TV series)"},{"id":"7790521","text":"The table tennis competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics consisted of four events. ==Medal summary== { - rowspan=2 Men's singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2 Men's doubles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2 Women's singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2 Women's doubles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  } ==Medal table== ==References== ==Sources== * Official Olympic Report * International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) * Category:1992 Summer Olympics events 1992 Category:1992 in table tennis ","title":"Table tennis at the 1992 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7790555","text":"Molecular modification is chemical alteration of a known and previously characterized lead compound for the purpose of enhancing its usefulness as a drug. This could mean enhancing its specificity for a particular body target site, increasing its potency, improving its rate and extent of absorption, modifying to advantage its time course in the body, reducing its toxicity, changing its physical or chemical properties (like solubility) to provide desired features. ==Modification for water solubility== Molecular modification is used to enhance drug’s water solubility by incorporating water solubilizing groups in its structure. The discussion of the introduction of water solubilizing groups into the structure of a lead compound can be conveniently broken down into four general areas: * The type of group introduced; * Whether the introduction is reversible or irreversible; * The position of incorporation; and * The chemical route of introduction. ===The type of group=== The incorporation of polar functional groups, such as the alcohol, amine, amide, carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid and phosphate groups, which either ionize or are capable of relatively strong intermolecular forces of attraction with water (hydrogen bonding), will usually result in analogues with an increased water solubility. Acidic and basic groups are particularly useful, since these groups can be used to form salts, which would give a wider range of dosage forms for the final product. However, the formation of zwitterions by the introduction of either an acid group into a structure containing a base or a base group into a structure containing an acid group can reduce water solubility. Introduction of weakly polar groups, such as carboxylic acid esters, aryl halides and alkyl halides, will not significantly improve water solubility and can result in enhanced lipid solubility. The incorporation of acidic residues into a lead structure is less likely to change the type of activity, but it can result in the analogue exhibiting haemolytic properties. Furthermore, the introduction of an aromatic acid group usually results in anti-inflammatory activity, whilst carboxylic acids with an alpha functional group may act as chelating agents. Basic water solubilizing groups have a tendency to change the mode of action, since bases often interfere with neurotransmitters and biological processes involving amines. However, their incorporation does mean that the analogue can be formulated as a wide variety of acid salts. Non-ionizable groups do not have the disadvantages of acidic and basic groups. ===Reversibly and irreversibly attached groups=== The type of group selected also depends on the degree of permanency required. Groups that are bound directly to the carbon skeleton of the lead compound by less reactive C–C, C–O and C–N bonds are likely to be irreversibly attached to the lead structure. Groups that are linked to the lead by ester, amide, phosphate, sulfate and glycosidic bonds are more likely to be metabolized from the resulting analogue to reform the parent lead compound as the analogue is transferred from its point of administration to its site of action. Compounds with this type of solubilizing group are acting as prodrugs and so their activity is more likely to be the same as the parent lead compound. However, the rate of loss of the solubilizing group will depend on the nature of the transfer route, and this could affect the activity of the drug. ===The position of the water solubilizing group=== In order to preserve the type of activity exhibited by the lead compound, the water solubilizing group should be attached to a part of the structure that is not involved in the drug–receptor interaction. Consequently, the route used to introduce a new water solubilizing group and its position in the lead structure will depend on the relative reactivities of the pharmacophore and the rest of the molecule. The reagents used to introduce the new water solubilizing group should be chosen on the basis that they do not react with, or in close proximity to, the pharmacophore. This will reduce the possibility of the new group affecting the relevant drug–receptor interactions. ===Methods of introduction=== Water solubilizing groups are best introduced at the beginning of a drug synthesis, although they may be introduced at any stage. Introduction at the beginning avoids the problem of a later introduction changing the type and/or nature of the drug–receptor interaction. A wide variety of routes may be used to introduce a water solubilizing group; the one selected will depend on the type of group being introduced and the chemical nature of the target structure. Many of these routes require the use of protecting agents to prevent unwanted reactions of either the water solubilizing group or the lead structure. ===Acidic and basic groups=== Examples of water solubilizing structures and the routes used to introduce them into the lead structures. O-alkylation, N-alkylation, O-acylation and N-acylation reactions are used to introduce both acidic and basic groups. Acetylation methods use both the appropriate acid chloride and anhydride. Examples of water solubilizing structures and the routes used to introduce them into lead structures. Phosphate acid halides have been used to introduce phosphate groups into lead structures. Structures containing hydroxy groups have been introduced by reaction of the corresponding monochlorinated hydrin and the use of suitable epoxides amongst other methods. Sulphonic acid groups may be introduced by either direct sulfonation or the addition of bisulfite to reactive C = C bonds amongst other methods. ==References== * Category:Pharmaceutical sciences ","title":"Molecular modification"},{"id":"7790565","text":"The Hanson Brothers are fictional characters in the 1977 movie Slap Shot. The characters are based on the Carlson brothers, who were actual hockey players. The movie, which stars Paul Newman, was written by Nancy Dowd. The story was based in part upon the experiences of her brother, Ned Dowd (who appears in the film as notorious hockey player Ogie Ogelthorpe), when he played for the North American Hockey League club in Johnstown, Pennsylvania called the Johnstown Jets of the North American Hockey League (NAHL). In the film, the fictional Charlestown Chiefs of the fictional Federal League are fashioned on the Jets and the NAHL. The Hanson Brothers provide several humorous moments in the film and are best remembered for: * starting fights * interrupting the coach in the locker room during pre-game speeches with overzealous shouting * wearing extremely thick nerd glasses * childishly playing with toy cars and trucks in their hotel room, although the brothers range in age from 18 to 20 In the film, The Hansons are brought in by the front office as part of an inexpensive deal, also as enforcers for the Charlestown Chiefs during the team's 1975–76 (and final) season. They are, in order of their numbers: * Jack Hanson (portrayed by David Hanson) – #16 Left Wing, age 19 * Steve Hanson (portrayed by Steve Carlson) – #17 Center, age 20 * Jeff Hanson (portrayed by Jeff Carlson) – #18 Right Wing, age 18 ==Biography== The film used many actual players from the Johnstown Jets, with filming commencing a few weeks after the Jets ended their 1975-76 season. The original plan was for the Hanson Brothers to be played by the Jets' trio of the real-life Carlson brothersJack, Steve and Jeff Carlson. However, just prior to shooting, brother Jack was called up by the Edmonton Oilers for their run in the 1976 World Hockey Association (WHA) playoffs. In his place, Jets player Dave Hanson filled the role. While the film's 'Hanson Brothers' were based on the real Carlson Brothers, the character of \\"Killer Carlson\\" in the film (played by professional actor Jerry Houser) is based on Dave Hanson-whose real hockey nickname was \\"Killer\\" Hanson. Thus, Dave Hanson filled in for Jack Carlson as one of the fictional Hanson Brothers - while another actor played a character modeled after Dave Hanson. Jack Carlson, the man Dave \\"played\\" in the movie, was also very well known throughout his career as an enforcer, and did pick up the real hockey nickname \\"Killer\\" Carlson. In the movie, the Hanson Brothers speak with a typical North Central American accent, owing to their hometowns, in areas where hockey is prevalent. The United States Hockey Hall of Fame is located in Eveleth, Minnesota, only a few miles from the city of Virginia, home of the real Carlsons. The Iron League, from which the Hansons are supposedly bought, is a reference to the Iron Range, a hockey hotbed in Northern Minnesota. Along with their time on minor professional teams like those depicted in the film, all three of the actors playing the Hanson Brothers played in the major leagues. At the end of the film, Paul Newman’s character gets a job as player- coach for a team in Minnesota for the 1976–77 season, intending to bring players from the defunct Chiefs with him; in real life, Dave Hanson, with Steve and Jack Carlson, played some games with the major league Minnesota Fighting Saints in the 1976–77 WHA season. Steve Carlson played in 225 games, in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and the WHA. Dave Hanson played in 136 games in the NHL and WHA. Jeff Carlson played 7 games in the WHA. Like their characters, both Dave Hanson and Jeff Carlson were known for a willingness to \\"drop the gloves\\". Steve Carlson did have some fights in his professional career, but was known more as a finesse player. Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and Dave Hanson continue to make personal appearances as the Hanson Brothers, typically at minor league hockey games . The brothers appeared at the first Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins Alumni Game in Wilkes- Barre, PA on April 4, 2009. The brothers played in a charity game March 23, 2013 in Kingston, Ontario, Canada for the benefit of Autism Kingston and the International Hockey Hall of Fame. They made an appearance in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 29, 2015, as they took part in the NHL & Kraft's Hockeyville USA, at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena, where all of the home game scenes in the movie were filmed. As the winner of Hockeyville USA contest, the Cambria County War Memorial Arena received $150,000 to renovate its scoreboard, lighting, and boards.http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=780872 ==In popular culture== *The Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League employ a trio of Hanson lookalikes known as the Mullet Brothers, who sport long black hair and black- rimmed glasses. The \\"brothers\\" shovel snow out of the net area during breaks in full uniform and pads. *Extreme Championship Wrestling characters The Dudley Brothers were based on the Hanson brothers. Two members of this stable, Bubba Ray & D-Von, would later shed the comedic elements of the gimmick and go on to become the Dudley Boyz tag team. *At the June 2011 NHL Awards, the Hanson Brothers appeared in a spoof sketch based on the popular television series Pawn Stars, in which they try to sell the Stanley Cup to proprietor Rick Harrison at his pawn shop.\\"Bruins Highlights From the NHL Awards\\".

He has played the most part of his career at Universidad de Chile, winning for the club eight league titles, a Copa Sudamericana, three cup titles and a supercup in 2015. He has represented Chilean football team at U20 level and Olympic level too, playing 21 official times for the adult team. Herrera has been part of Chile’s both Copa América titles in 2015 and 2016. ==Club career== Herrera playing for the \\"U\\" in 2018. Born in Angol, Herrera joined Universidad de Chile youth squad and was promoted to the first/adult team in 1999. Three years later, he became the first-choice keeper after being back-up for Sergio Vargas, who left The Lions after 10 years playing there. In 2004, Herrera won his first professional title after defeating Cobreloa as visitors in the Torneo Apertura final, where he scored the winning goal during the shootout, giving the club their twelfth League title. In 2006, he moved to Brazilian giants Corinthians. Following an unsuccessful spell at Brazil — where only played nine official games — he returned to Chile and signed for Everton from Vina del Mar in 2007. There, he helped the team to win the 2008 Torneo Apertura. However, in June 2008, Herrera left Everton to sign for Audax Italiano. In 2011, Herrera returned to Universidad de Chile. That year he had a brilliant season, being a major figure in the club’s first treble in its history after winning both league tournaments (Apertura and Clausura) and the Copa Sudamericana, under the guidance of coach Jorge Sampaoli. Noteworthy, Herrera was even chosen as the goalkeeper of the season by Conmebol. In 2012, he helped Universidad de Chile to win the Torneo Apertura, which meant the club’s first ever league tri- championship, as well as the last reached during the Sampaoli era. On 20 May 2013, he featured in Universidad de Chile's 2–1 victory over Universidad Católica in the 2012–13 Copa Chile Final, the club's fourth cup in the contest. On 18 March 2014, Herrera scored his first official goal in a 1–0 Copa Libertadores group stage win over Peru’s Real Garcilaso, through a penalty kick. The same year he helped the club win the Torneo Apertura. His first League goal came on 22 November during a University Derby against Católica in a 2–2 draw. On 2 December, Herrera won his twelfth professional title after defeating in the Copa Chile Final to rivals Colo-Colo in the shootout, where he saved a penalty and scored the winning goal. On 13 February 2016, he scored his third official goal in a 2–1 defeat to Palestino, after scoring on a successful penalty. ==International career== Herrera with the Chilean national team in 2017 Herrera has been representing the Chilean national team since he was a youth player, participating in its U-20 and U-23 levels, this last as one of the 23 players nominated to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. His first call-up to the adult team was in 2002 in a game against Mexico, but however his last was in 2005. Years later, during the best moment of his career between 2011 and 2012 playing for Universidad de Chile, Herrera curiously didn't receive nominations from Claudio Borghi, the incumbent coach. The press usually alluded to an internal dispute between them, but with Borghi's departure in December 2012, the situation changed in Herrera's favor. After almost 7 years absence, Herrera was reconsidered by Jorge Sampaoli, who finally took the helm. He received his first call up from Sampaoli for the friendly matches against Haiti and Senegal in January 2013, where he stated that Herrera would play against Haiti, rotating the goal- keeping duties with Christopher Toselli. Nevertheless, he played both games which were 2–1 and 3–0 wins respectively. On 5 March 2014, Herrera earned his eighth cap against Germany in Stuttgart after replacing first-choice Claudio Bravo due to injury. However, he gave a fine performance during the game played at Mercedes-Benz Arena which Chile lost 1–0 on a Mario Götze goal. Having been part of the entire qualification campaign since Sampaoli‘s taking, Herrera was named in Chile's list of 23 for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. On 5 June, he played in a 2–0 friendly win over Northern Ireland, prior to the World Cup. He was part of the 2015 Copa América champion team as back-up keeper to Claudio Bravo as well as in the 2016 Centenario edition. In 2017, he was nominated to the Confederations Cup and played two matches against Cameroon (a 2–0 victory) and Australia (a 1–1 draw). That cup, Chile was runner-up after being defeated 1–0 by Germany in the final. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Universidad de Chile * Primera División de Chile (8): 1999, 2000, 2004 Apertura, 2011 Apertura, 2011 Clausura, 2012 Apertura, 2014 Apertura, 2017 Clausura * Copa Sudamericana (1): 2011 * Copa Chile (3): 2000, 2012–13, 2015 * Supercopa de Chile (1): 2015 ;Everton * Primera División de Chile (1): 2008 Apertura ===International=== ;Chile *Copa América (2): 2015, 2016 ===Individual=== * Campeonato Nacional (Chile) Goalkeeper of the Season: 2011 * CONMEBOL Goalkeeper of the Season: 2011 * Copa Sudamericana Team of the Season: 2011 * Campeonato Nacional (Chile) Team of the Season (3): 2010, 2011, 2012 ==See also== *List of goalscoring goalkeepers ==ReferencesCategory:Chilean footballers Category:Universidad de Chile footballers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Audax Italiano footballers Category:Everton de Viña del Mar footballers Category:Chilean Primera División players Category:Chile under-20 international footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Chilean expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:People from Angol Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:Chilean football goalkeeper stubs Category:Living people Category:1981 births Category:2014 FIFA World Cup players Category:2015 Copa América players Category:Copa América Centenario players Category:2017 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:Copa América-winning players Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Chile Category:Footballers at the 2000 Summer Olympics ","title":"Johnny Herrera (footballer)"},{"id":"7790571","text":"Keith Diamond may refer to: *Keith Diamond (songwriter) (1950–1997), American songwriter and producer *Keith Diamond (actor) (born 1962), American TV and voice actor ","title":"Keith Diamond"},{"id":"7790579","text":"St Margaret's Almshouses are part of a 12th-century leper colony in Taunton, Somerset, England. ==History== The building was founded as a leper hospital in the 12th century, Somerset Historical Environmental Records dates it to between 1174-1180 AD. Records of Taunton Priory describe it as The Chapel of St Margaret 'infirmorum' in 1180. Glastonbury Abbey acquired the patronage of the hospital in 1280 and Abbot Beere rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th century. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the associated chapel was demolished. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued to be used as almshouses, cared for by a local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. The designer of those renovations was William Worrall of Glastonbury.'Great son of Somerset' in Taunton Courier, 15 July 1939 From the late 1980s and the building then stood empty and then, in the early 1990s the thatched roof was destroyed by fire and the building suffered from vandalism and neglect until the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust with Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it using, as faithfully as possible, the original architecture and building materials. After restoration it was purchased by Falcon Rural Housing as four dwellings of social housing. It is a long freestanding single storey building, built mostly of local shillet stone.

Abu Darda's own preaching focused on the insignificance of worldly wealth and the minor details of life. According to him, this life was comparable to a loan. It is said of Abu Darda that once a friend went to visit him at his home. On reaching there, the friend noticed, with grave concern, the appalling condition of Abu Darda's house. According to the friend, Abu Darda's house was shorter than the full height of a standing man. It was also as narrow as it was short, and the household utilities were less than basic. When the friend inquired from Abu Darda why he lived in such dire conditions, Darda's response was: \\"Do not worry my friend, this is just my temporary shade. I am building a proper house somewhere, slowly putting good things deserving thereof.\\" When, on another occasion, the friend went back and found the same deprived shade, he demanded to know why Abu Darda had not moved to his better house. It was then that Abu Darda revealed to him that the house he referred to was the Kabr (the grave). He also strongly advocated the acquisition of knowledge, saying, “None of you can be pious unless he is knowledgeable, and he cannot enjoy knowledge unless he applies it practically.” Abu Darda praised scholars of Islam greatly for their knowledge and application of it. He lauded both the student and the teacher, saying they would receive equal reward. ==References== ==External links== * Islamic Encyclopedia * Biography of Abu Darda Category:580 births Category:652 deaths Category:6th-century Arabs Category:Sahabah who participated in the battle of Uhud Category:Sahabah hadith narrators ","title":"Abu Darda"},{"id":"7790620","text":"George Hanger may refer to: * George Hanger, 4th Baron Coleraine (1751–1824), British soldier, author, and eccentric * George Wallace William Hanger (1866–1935), labor negotiator for the Federal Board of Mediation and Conciliation ","title":"George Hanger"},{"id":"7790638","text":"Machigonne may refer to * Portland, Maine, which was formerly known as Machigonne to the indigenous people of the region * Machigonne (yacht), a yacht that served in both the United States and Royal Canadian navies * Yankee (ferry), a ship in New York harbor also known as Machigonne (and listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places under the Machigonne name).

This is a list of the chapters of the Japanese manga series Death Note, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The individual chapters were originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump, from December 2003 to May 2006, with 108 chapters in all. The series primarily focuses on high school student Light Yagami who decides to use a supernatural notebook called the \\"Death Note\\", which kills anyone whose name is written in it, to rid the world of evil. Death Note has been compiled into twelve tankōbon in Japan, with the first being released on April 2, 2004, and the twelfth on July 4, 2006. In addition to these, a guidebook for the manga, Death Note 13: How to Read, was also published on October 13, 2006. The guidebook has information about the series, with character profiles, creator interviews, and the pilot chapter that preceded Death Note. A one-shot story special of Death Note was also released in February 2008, and is set two years after the original story's epilogue; a second one-shot was announced to be in development in April 2019.https://twitter.com/Spytrue/status/1122081734953177089 Death Note has been adapted into an anime with thirty-seven episodes produced by Nippon Television, and has three live action films. The Death Note manga is licensed by Viz Media for North American distribution under their \\"Shonen Jump Advanced\\" imprint. Viz published the first volume on October 10, 2005, and the last on July 3, 2007. A hardcover version of volume 1 was also released by Viz on September 16, 2008. Viz published Death Note 13: How to Read on February 19, 2008, and collected the Death Note volumes along with Death Note 13: How to Read into a box set on October 7, 2008. On October 4, 2016, all 12 original manga volumes and the February 2008 one-shot were released in a single All-in- One Edition, consisting of 2,400 pages in a single book. The All-in-One Edition was released in English on September 6, 2017, resulting in the February 2008 one-shot being released in English for the first time. A standalone Death Note: Special One Shot written by Ohba and drawn by Obata, was published in February 2020. __TOC__ ==Volume list== Tsugumi Ohba stated that most of the chapter titles for Death Note were selected during the development of the thumbnails. He added that sometimes he created several choices and consulted his editor for the final selections. He and his editor often selected the final name of the following chapter while he made corrections to the one that he was currently working on. Ohba had selected the names of chapters 107 and 108 before the thumbnail stages of those chapters. After the selection of the name of Chapter 3, Ohba decided to have each chapter name consist of one Japanese word. Ohba said that around the time of the selection of the name of Chapter 4, he began to \\"have fun\\" with the chapter names and begin trying to avoid spoiling plot information through the selection of chapter names. Ohba intended for many of his titles, such as the title of Chapter 7, to have many meanings depending on how one approaches the name.Ohba, Tsugumi and Takeshi Obata. \\"The Origins of All 108 Chapter Titles\\".

Minoru inquires about Kira's use of the book, as well as the rules of the Death Note. As the world has adopted more intense surveillance to prevent another Kira incident, Minoru devises a scheme and willingly gives Ryuk the notebook back but asks him to return in two years before he loses his memories. Two years later, Ryuk returns and touches Minoru with the book, restoring his memories. Minoru reveals his plan is to auction off the power Kira had to the highest bidder, and uses Ryuk to have this broadcast over television. The bids over social media escalate quickly, while Near and the surviving SPK members, having had touched the Death Note previously, see Ryuk via camera footage but no way to trace him to the new \\"A-Kira\\". SPK try to catch Ryuk during another message but inadvertently appear on-screen, giving weight to the seriousness of the auction, and soon world leaders start bidding, including the presidents of China and the United States (appearing similar to Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, respectively, though otherwise not named) The US president offers a bid of a quadrillion yen, upon which Minoru decides to close the auction. Through Ryuk, Minoru instructs the U.S. to deposit the amount across all accounts of Japanese citizens under 60 years old with Yotsuba bank accounts, an amount that comes to roughly one billion yen per person. However, the activities on Earth over the Death Note have alerted the Shinigami King, who orders Ryuk to come once he leaves Minoru. After the U.S. follows through on payment, Minoru relinquishes the Death Note again for Ryuk to deliver and asks him never to see him again. Near realizes that A-Kira's activities have made it impossible to identify his identity outside of one to benefit from this economic boon, and abandons the case. When Ryuk arrives at the White House, Ryuk reveals there was a change in the Death Note rules by the King: that anyone attempting to sell or purchase the book would be killed upon completion of the sale. The President refuses to take ownership of the book, and instead will assert that he still has the power of Kira but chooses not to use it to improve his standing. To follow the new rule, Ryuk writes Minoru's name in the Death Note when he attempts to take out his share of the newfound wealth, killing him. ==References== mf=yes Death Note ","title":"List of Death Note chapters"},{"id":"7790720","text":"Caerhun () is a scattered rural community, and former civil parish, on the west bank of the River Conwy.

Baillie Reynolds' reports were originally published in Archaeologia. Page found on Kanovium Project website although there have of course been several other publications since. The church and its churchyard occupy the north-east quarter of the original Roman site. Canovium was built at an ancient river crossing and was an important post on the Roman road and ancient drovers road via Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen to Abergwyngregyn and the Menai Strait. Latterly the best crossing point, now with a bridge, has been at nearby Tal-y-Cafn. After the end of Roman rule in Britain, the fort was associated with King Rhun Hir of Gwynedd, hence the subsequent name.

They made a variety of clothing including shirts, jumpers, trousers, gilets and jackets, however by far their most popular item was their snorkel parka. It became so popular that people would often refer to it as a \\"a Lord Anthony\\" rather than a \\"parka\\" or \\"anorak\\". It became a school playground legend and even the subject of a song by Belle & Sebastian on the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress. ==Outerwear== The nylon snorkel parka with blue outer and orange lining became almost standard school wear in the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Lord Anthony were manufacturers of outerwear in general. It was not a premium or fashion brand, but was at the top end of the utility section generally producing reasonably well-made and durable garments. Whilst they did use some other materials, their garments tended to be made from nylon fabric and use cheap but warm polyester padding. ==Snorkel parka== Lord Anthony became well known during the 1980s for their snorkel parka, which became the winter coat of choice for some schoolboys. Whereas other manufacturers (such as Brutus, Wakefields, and Keynote) were producing good quality snorkel parkas, the Lord Anthony version was often regarded as the best. Now that snorkel parkas have come back into fashion, the original \\"old school\\" version have become highly sought after and command high prices in retro shops and on eBay. Lord Anthony parkas often get high prices and even well worn, dirty, and torn versions can still get a good price. ==Changing branding== The branding used by Lord Anthony changed over the years. This shows all branding used on their snorkel parka jackets from the oldest to the newest It is possible to tell the age of a Lord Anthony jacket from the branding labels attached to it. The Earliest versions did not actually mention the Lord Anthony name at all but can be identified from the content label which has red embroidered writing on a black background. This version also did not have the Lord Anthony badge on the sleeve pen pocket. The second generation was where the Lord Anthony badge first appeared on the sleeve pen pocket and the content label was updated to contain the \\"stick man wearing a crown\\" logo on the inside label. Mid period jackets then gained the Lord Anthony name on the inside label. Late period jackets acquired a much more elaborate label with an embroidered design and the \\"Polar Gear\\" identity. These jackets lost the \\"stick man with a crown\\" Lord Anthony logo on the label; however, they retained the Lord Anthony tag on the sleeve pen pocket. Because the Polar Gear branded label inside the neck line did not include material content details an additional content label was attached near the bottom of the lining. The Polar Gear branding was the last to be used on Lord Anthony snorkel parkas but continued to be used on other padded nylon jackets after production of parkas ceased in the mid-1980s. The older the jacket labelling, the higher the price it commands on the second hand market. File:Vintage Lord Anthony Snorkel Parka.JPGA vintage Lord Anthony snorkel parka surviving after 30 years.

Because of this property it causes an antibody response similar to the one elicited by the epitope. An antibody for a given epitope antigen will recognize a mimotope which mimics that epitope. Mimotopes are commonly obtained from phage display libraries through biopanning. Vaccines utilizing mimotopes are being developed. Mimotopes are a kind of peptide Aptamers. When the term mimotope was first coined by Mario Geysen in 1986, it was used to describe peptides mimicking epitope. However, this concept has been extended to refer peptide mimic of all types of binding sites. As the mimic of binding site, mimotope analysis has been widely used in mapping epitopes, identifying drug target and inferring protein interaction networks. Furthermore, mimotope has also shown its potential in the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. In addition, special affinities mediated by mimotopes to various semiconductors and other materials have shown very encouraging promise in new material and new energy studies. Gathering information on mimotopes into a special database therefore deserves. In 2010, the MimoDB database version 1.0 was released. It had 10716 peptides grouped into 1229 sets. These peptides were extracted from biopanning results of phage-displayed random peptide libraries reported in 571 papers. The MimoDB database has been updated to the current version 2.0 very recently. In version 2.0, it has 15633 peptides collected from 849 papers and grouped into 1818 sets. Besides the core data on panning experiments and their results, broad background information on target, template, library and structure is included. An accompanied benchmark has also been compiled for bioinformaticians to develop and evaluate their new models, algorithms and programs. In addition, the MimoDB database provides tools for simple and advanced searches, structure visualization, BLAST and alignment view on the fly. The experimental biologists can easily use the database as a virtual control to exclude possible target-unrelated peptides. The MimoDB database is freely available. ==References== Category:Immune system ","title":"Mimotope"},{"id":"7790943","text":"Abba Samuel (Ge'ez: አባ ሳሙኤል Abbā Sāmū'ēl; b. c. 1350Steven Kaplan, Hagiographies and the History of Medieval Ethiopia, History in Africa, African Studies Association, 1981, p.114.) of the monastery of Dabra Wagag (Ge'ez: ዘደብረ ወገግ za-Dabra Wagag, modern ze-Debre Wegeg, \\"of Dabra Wagag\\") was an Ethiopian saint living in the latter half of the 14th and the first decades of the 15th century. The source for his life is his Gadl (a type of Ethiopian hagiography), most accessible in Stanislas Kur's French translation of the Ge'ez original, Actes de Samuel de Dabra Wagag. The original work (Ge'ez: ገድለ ሳሙኤል ዘወገግ Gadla Sāmū'ēl za-Wagag) survives only in two 20th century manuscripts, both copies of a 16th-century revision of an earlier composition.Kaplan, Hagiographies and the History of Medieval Ethiopia, pp.110-1. ==Birth and childhood, education.== Like the parents of many other saints, and reminiscent of the story of Hannah and Elkanah in the opening chapters of the Books of Samuel, Abba Samuel's parents, Andreyas (\\"Andrew\\") and Arsonwa, longed for a child, but were almost too old to beget one. After a visit of the saint Tekle Haymanot (a chronological impossibility as Tekle Haymanot had died before Samuel's birth) to the aging couple, Arsonwa became pregnant and gave birth to a son, with the help of a midwife.Steven Kaplan, Seen but Not Heard: Children and Childhood in Medieval Ethiopian Hagiographies, The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Board of Trustees, Boston University. Published by Boston University African Studies Center, 1991, p.544 The child was said to be born with the Holy Communion in his right hand. The saint baptised the child and called him Samuel. When Samuel was seven (or sixKur, Gadla Samuel, p.17) years of age, he was considered old enough to learn, leaving home to live in a monastery with Tekle Haymanot, his teacher and spiritual father.Kaplan, Seen but not Heard, p.548, 550. Samuel, as usual in spiritual education in Ethiopia, was ordained deacon, and later priest. Still later, after having become a monk, he left his teacher Tekle Haymanot to live a life of his own. Samuel was sent to the region of Yagmu which he renamed Wagag, \\"Dawn\\". There he built his first church, called Hagere Maskal, \\"Community of the Cross\\". ==Fate of Andreyas, Samuel's father== In Samuel's father's time, Emperor Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia had had the adherents of Tekle Haymanot deported, because they denounced the king's marriage with a concubine of his father. Andreyas was chased away to Krestos Fatar. After a fruitful life as a monk in Krestos Fatar he was called to the king a second time. This time, he was tortured together with his fellow- believers, and afterwards exiled. He died on the road and was buried in Enasedestey. When the Ethiopian Emperor Dawit I of Ethiopia ascended the throne in 1382, things changed, as the new Emperor was more pious and favorable to the monk. Samuel had the opportunity to visit the grave of his father in Enasedestey, where he built a church, in which he reburied the bones of his father, at the foot of the Tabot. ==First miracle== A baker of Emperor Dawit I came to beg for the help of Abba Samuel, because he had burnt the king's bread in baking it. Samuel reassured the man and urged him to have faith. As soon as the king noticed the burned bread, he became angry and ordered the poor baker whipped. As the whip was about to land on the baker's back, it broke in half. The royal executioner tried to hit him a second time with the remnant of the whip, but it split in half again. And so forth. When Dawit learnt that the baker was protected by Samuel, he was pacified and showed mercy. ==Arsonwa, Samuel's mother== Dawit appointed Abba Samuel as patriarch over the territory of Endagabton. On his way to his new duty, Samuel visited his homeland Zem, to visit his mother. She had become an old lady. Samuel brought her into the monastery of Wagag, where she spent the rest of her life as a nun. She died on the 6th of the month of Säne in an unknown year, and was buried in Wagag. Samuel mourned by her grave for forty days and forty nights, and then purified himself in the Setal River. When he dove into the water, he uncovered the snares of a demon named Qwetel in the form of a 40-metre (130 ft) piece of rope. Samuel brought it up on to dry land and repaired the roof of his church with it. ==Church building== After building Hagere Maskal in the territory of Wagag, Samuel built further churches everywhere he travelled. He called the people to the Orthodox faith, mostly after having chased away the locally operating demons or dask. He asked the people to give him land to build them churches and monasteries, and also asked for building materials. The Actes attributes at least ten churches and monasteries to him, and says he appointed numerous fellow believers as priests and leaders of the new communities. Many church building stories show the recurrent pattern of a demon or a pack of them dominating a territory, victory over the demons by Abba Samuel, baptism and conversion to the orthodox faith of the inhabitants and finally the building of a church. There are some remarkable stories in which trees play a role as focus of veneration for the non-Christianised people and as a hiding place for demons. They all show the recurring motifs of a tree inhabited by the pagan spirit Dask (or Desk), the fear of the people to cut this tree and the tree nearly fatally falling over them when it is felt. But by driving out the spirits, defeating the demons and by cutting the trees, Abba Samuel acquired the wood needed for the construction of doors, portals and roofs for his churches. ===The daero tree=== One of these stories is, in brief: There was a great tree in the land of Zem, a daero tree. This tree bled like a woman once a month, and a serpent is lurked in its branches. Abba Samuel came to Zem to drive out the serpent and fell the tree. He succeeded in cutting the tree after having signed his face by the cross and after having set his axe to the stem in the name of the Holy Trinity. A poisonous dragon escaped from the tree. Its poison was neutralised by the prayers of Samuel, and after having received 81 blows from the public, it died. At the end of the story, Samuel baptises the people, teaches them te orthodox faith and starts the construction of the church of Zem in the name of Our Lady Mary. ==The death of Abba Samuel== Abba Samuel died on the 29th of the month Teqemt in Yazarzar, where he was buried. The year of his death is not mentioned. Seven months later, on the 27th of Genbot, his disciple Samra Krestos had his remains taken to Wagag and reburied him there. ==References== *Actes de Samuel de Dabra Wagag, traduits par Stanislas Kur.

It is located in Stara Zagora Province, south-central Bulgaria. It consists of three lignite-fired thermal power stations. The complex is located in a large lignite coal basin, which includes several mines, enrichment plants, a briquette plant and its own railway system. The development of the thermal power and mining complex at Maritsa Iztok began in 1952, but the lignite deposits used to be known well in the mid-19th century. The Maritsa Iztok mines and power plants are interdependent as the only market for coal is the power plants, while the power plants have no other supplier of coal but the mines. == Maritsa Iztok-1 (TPS AES Galabovo)== Maritsa Iztok-1 is located near Galabovo. In October 1998, the old power plant with a capacity of 500 megawatts (MW) was privatized and sold to Consolidated Continental Commerce (3C), later purchased by AES Corporation. On 15 February 2000, AES and the Bulgarian grid operator Natzionalna Elektricheska Kompania EAD (NEK) signed a 15-year tolling agreement, according to which AES has an obligation to replace the old power station with a new facility. In June 2006, AES started construction of the new 670 MW power station. It became operational on 3 June 2011. The new power station consists of two pulverised coal boilers of 335 MW each, two steam turbines, two generators and desulphurisation facilities. The plant was constructed by Alstom. It cost €1.2 billion. It is the first large- scale power plant built in Bulgaria in the last 20 years, and the single largest foreign investment in Bulgaria and one of the largest green field investments in South East Europe. == Maritsa Iztok-2== Maritsa Iztok-2 is the largest thermal power plant in the Balkans. It is located from Stara Zagora in the vicinity of the village of Radetski and the dam lake Ovcharitsa. The construction of Maritsa Iztok-2 started on 7 May 1962; it was inaugurated on 10 November 1966. Between 1979 and 1995 the power station was expanded by four additional units. 1977 and 1980 two new tall chimneys were built. Maritsa Iztok-2 has a total installed capacity of 1,465 MW and generates 30% of Bulgaria's electricity. It consists of eight generating units, two of which are equipped with flue gas desulphurization plants. The rehabilitation of the older power units, including construction of FGD plants for units 1 to 6, are in progress. Maritsa Iztok-2 is wholly state-owned. It is a subsidiary of Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD. In November 2014 the power station was ranked as the industrial facility that is causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in Bulgaria and the entire European Union by the European Environment Agency. In June 2019 a fire thought to be caused by routine maintenance broke out on the smokestack of the flue gas desulphurisation system at Unit 8. == Maritsa Iztok-3== Maritsa Iztok-3 is Bulgaria's third- largest power plant. It is located from Stara Zagora. The power plant has an installed capacity of 900 MW, which is produced by four units of each 225 MW. It has a tall chimney. In 1998, the United States power utility Entergy Corporation purchased 73% of Maritsa Iztok-3 shares for US$375 million from the Bulgarian state. Entergy also has the obligation to modernize the power station. In 2002, the Italian power company Enel joined the project; in 2006 Enel acquired Entergy's stake. At present, Maritsa Iztok-3 is owned and operated by Energiina Kompaniya Maritsa Iztok 3 AD, a joint venture of ContourGlobal (73%) and NEK (27%). Enel is planning to invest in a new 700-800 MW coal-fired power plant next to the existing Maritsa Iztok-3 plant. The new power plant is expected to cost €900 million. ==New power station== The Bulgarian power regulator is expected to open a competitive procedure for the construction of a new 700 MW plant in the Maritsa Iztok basin. In addition to Enel's new power station project, the construction of a new power station is proposed by the German utility RWE. RWE and the Maritsa Iztok mining complex have signed an agreement on setting up a joint company that will apply for construction of the power station. RWE expects the investment to be €900 million to €1 billion, and the power station to be ready by 2013. ==See also== * Energy in Bulgaria ==References== ==External links== * Maritsa Iztok 2 power station (Bulgarian) * Maritsa Iztok 3 ENEL power station Category:Coal-fired power stations in Bulgaria Category:Buildings and structures in Stara Zagora Province Category:Chimneys in Bulgaria Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1966 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1980 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2011 ","title":"Maritsa Iztok Complex"},{"id":"7790955","text":"Piperia yadonii, also known as Yadon's piperia or Yadon's rein orchid, is an endangered orchid endemic to a narrow range of coastal habitat in northern Monterey County, California. In 1998 this plant was designated as an endangered species by the United States government, the major threat to its survival being continuing land development from an expanding human population and associated habitat loss.United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered and threatened wildlife and plants: Final rule listing five plants from Monterey County, California as endangered or threatened. Federal Register 63: 43100–43116 (1998) One of the habitats of Yadon's Piperia, the Del Monte Forest near Monterey, California, is the subject of a federal lawsuit, based upon endangerment of this organism along with several other endangered species. This wildflower may lie dormant in a given year and not emerge above the soil surface from its tuberous substructure. After leafing out in the spring, it will produce flowers on erect spikes, each flower possessing both green and white petals. It prefers sandy soils, and subsists on nutrient extraction from intermediate fungal organisms. ==Description== Along with most other orchids P. yadonii: (a) is a bisexual perennial green plant that grows from buried tubers; manifests a fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (b) exhibits pollen that is sticky, and which is removed as sessile anther sacs; and (c) has a stigma fused with its style into a column. There are a total of eight species in the genus Piperia, which is named for American botanist Charles V. Piper. The genus members manifest generally cylindrical spikes or racemes. As with other Piperia, Yadon's Piperia exhibits a single veined flower one to two millimeters in width and a basal rosette leaf formation. The subsurface architecture of this terrestrial wild orchid consists of a rhizome structure, from which emanate tubers. The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients. A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being lanceolate in shape.Morgan & Ackerman, Lindleyana 5:205–211 (1990) Each leaf ranges from 10 to 15 centimeters in length and 20 to 35 millimeters in width. Leaves of younger plants are often more diminutive in size. The dense inflorescence is borne on a single erect vertical spike varying from 12 to 55 centimeters in height.The Jepson manual: higher plants of California, Hickman, JC, ed., University of California Press, Berkeley, Ca. (1993) Each flower has a spur of length 1.5 to 5 millimeters, short compared to other members of the genus. Yadon's Piperia typically presents three upper tepals, each of which contains both green and white pigmentation; moreover, there are three lower tepals that are white only. The earliest blooming time is June. When P. yadonii blooms, as late as August, all of its sepals and petals may be purely white. Another key identification feature is the characteristically abbreviated spur, which typically measures 1.5 to 6.0 millimeters in length. P. yadonii's leaves usually wither by blooming time, except for a small percentage of very large individuals. The geographic range of P. yadonii overlaps that of P. elegans, P. elongata, P. michaelii, and P. transversa; consequently, P. yadonii is clearly distinguished from them only in the flowering stage. Sympatric occurrences in mixed populations with P. elongata and P. elegans are noted in the literature. ==Reproduction and symbiosis== Seeds of this species, like other orchids, lack an endosperm.T.C. Wells, Population ecology of terrestrial orchids: The biological aspects of rare plant conservation, H. Synge, John Wiley & Sons. Ltd: 281–295 (1981) The extremely small seeds must come in contact with appropriate soil fungi in order to germinate. The resulting seedlings obtain fixed carbon from the fungus until they produce their first leaves and begin to photosynthesize. This strategy is known as myco- heterotrophy. Vegetative reproduction may also occur. ==Distribution and habitat== Yadon's piperia is confined to a handful of locations in the coastal area of north Monterey County primarily the Del Monte Forest on the Monterey Peninsula. Tiny populations have been found in the Prunedale Hills; and an isolated southernmost population on Rocky Creek Ridge (Cushing Mountain) at Big Sur. Specific places of occurrence within those areas are the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Reserve; Manzanita County Park; and the Nature Conservancy’s Blohm Ranch Nature Preserve. Each colony is rather small in patch size, measured on the order of twenty acres or less. All of the occurrences are below about 250 meters above mean sea level and all are within six miles of the Pacific Ocean. Yadon's piperia is generally restricted to three habitats: (a) Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) forest, sometimes with Gowen's cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) which includes more than 80 percent of the known populations; (b) California Northern coastal scrub, with dwarfed Hooker's manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri) or Eastwood's manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa); and (c) Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) forest. The colonies in woodland settings are found under partial canopy in an open, primarily herbaceous understory shape. The Monterey Peninsula and northern Big Sur areas are influenced by a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey submarine canyon. Rainfall is 40 to 50 centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for Yadon's Piperia and other plants that would otherwise not be able to persist with such low precipitation. ==History and conservation== Piperia yadonii was named for Vern Yadon, former longtime director of the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. The Monterey Peninsula, where all colonies of Yadon's piperia occur, is recognized to have a high degree of species endemicism. Species with more northern ranges often reach their southern limits on the Peninsula; species with more southern affinities reach their northern limits there as well. On the Monterey Peninsula some taxa comprising habitat for P. yadonii, such as the coastal closed-cone pines and cypresses are relict stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the mesic climate of the late Pleistocene period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early Holocene period between 6000 and 2000 BC.C.I. Millar, Reconsidering the Conservation of Monterey Pine. Fremontia 26(3):12–16 (1998) Yadon's piperia, along with certain other threatened species in the northern California Floristic Province, has been designated as a species meriting protection by the U.S. Government, State of California, local governments and private conservation groups. These designations have led to blueprints for protection of Yadon's piperia in the form of official endangerment classifications and a species Recovery Plan,Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for Five Plants From Monterey County, CA, Federal Register: May 13, 2002, Volume 67, Number 92, Pages 32003–32004 the latter promulgated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Even with all these efforts, the total current population is not necessarily above the minimum viable population without further elements of protection. The listing as a federally endangered species occurred in 1998, promptedU.S. Federal Register: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326–39337) by a study conducted by Earth Metrics for the city of Monterey, which found the colony in the Del Monte forest to be threatened by proposed land development.C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest, Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992) Subsequently, in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acted on this new information regarding Yadon's piperia, and promulgated a notice of intent to classify the species as endangered. Monitoring populations of Yadon's piperia is challenging since each tuber does not produce emergent leaves or flowers in a given year. To complicate matters further, the plant can only be identified conclusively in its flowering stage, and yet, even when the plant leafs out, it may not necessarily produce a flower in a given year. Furthermore, by the time a flower is produced, the leaves have typically senesced; thus, a survey conducted during the flowering season will miss plants that have leafed out but not flowered. ==See also== *Hickman's potentilla *Minimum viable population == References== == External links == * *Calflora: Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia, Yadon's rein orchid) * USDA Plants Profile for Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia) *Jepson eFlora: Piperia yadonii *U.S.EPA endangered species listing detail for P. yadonii *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service species profile for P. yadonii * Piperia yadonii — UC Photos gallery yadonii Category:Endemic flora of California Category:Orchids of California Category:Endemic orchids of the United States Category:Natural history of Monterey County, California ","title":"Piperia yadonii"},{"id":"7790964","text":"Ze\`ir Anpin (Aramaic: זְעֵיר אַנפִּין meaning \\"Lesser Countenance/Small Face\\", called Microprosopus in the Kabbala Denudata) is a revealed aspect of God in Kabbalah, comprising the emotional sephirot attributes: Chesed, Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. The Zohar's imagery expounds its role in Creation, where it is the microscopic equivalent of Arich Anpin (Macroprosopus) in the Sephirotic tree of life. The Siphra Dtzenioutha portrays it as the revealed face of God, and the Idra Rabba elaborates on the Kabbalistic significance of its several attributes. Its Tetragrammaton is YHVH (יהוה), the name of God in Judaism. In 16th century Lurianic doctrine it becomes systemised as one of the 6 Primary Partzufim Divine Personae, as part of the cosmic process of Tikkun Rectification. ==Uniting Zeir Anpin-Short Face with Nukvah-Female== Zeir Anpin, the emotional sephirot centred on Tiferet (Beauty), is the transcendent revelation of God to Creation (\\"The Holy One Blessed Be He\\"), a perceptible manifestation of the essential Divine infinity (the Tetragrammaton name of God). Nukvah (\\"Female\\" of Zeir Anpin) is the indwelling immanent Shekhinah (Feminine Divine Presence) within Creation, the concealed Divine finitude (the name Elokim). In Medieval Kabbalah, the sin of Adam, as well as later sin, introduces apparent separation (perceived from Creation) between the two, bringing exile and constriction on High. The task of man is restoring union (Yichud) to the Male and Female Divine manifestations. This is the origin of the Kabbalistic prayer formula recited before performing a Jewish observance. Within the tetragrammaton, the first two letters signify the Concealed World/Upper Unity with God, and the latter two signify the Created World/Lower Unity: > \\"For the sake of the union of the Holy One Blessed be He, and His Shekhinah, > to unite the name Y-H with V-H in a perfect union, in the name of all > Israel\\" In Lurianic Kabbalah, the origin of disharmony in the Sephirot is located earlier, in the primordial Realm of Tohu before the creation of Man, though later sin brings further exile. The task of man, while also affecting Male- Female union on High, involves Messianic redemption of the exiled \\"Sparks of Holiness\\" (Birur) from Tohu that are scattered within Physical existence. Birur becomes the inner dimension of Yichud. Each indwelling spark is relatively female in relation to the person who redeems it from captivity. The collectivity of all sparks, similar to the collective People of Israel, also comprises the exiled Shekhinah, awaiting raising up to God. ==See also== *Yetzirah *Partzufim *Arich Anpin *Nukvah ==References== *Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Kehot pub.

However, due to the financial offsetting that the breakup of Soviet Union brought onto the Ukrainian economy, which had a devastating effect on the construction of the Metro, and frequent breaks due to the lack of finances affected the quality. Another important factor was the need for the station. The station is located in the centre of the city where the density of Metro stations was already large, and inter-station distances are short. Moreover, the square for which the station is named (Square of the Lviv Gateway) was (and still is) not great in importance (transport links or commercially) to justify the absolute need for the station (as opposed to Lukianivska). Finally it was the square itself that proved to have the deciding reason, because the original location for the escalator tunnel needed altering, a disagreement arose on where it will be located. All this led to the station not opening with the first part of the Syretsky radius in 1996. After the financial situation slowly improved towards the late 1990s, various optimistic forecasts started promising the completion of the station accurate to the opening day: 14 October 1999, 30 December 1999. However, after the opening of the third station on the radius, Dorohozhychi, most of the attention switched to other extensions and Lvivska Brama was in a way forgotten. Ironically, between Dorohozhychi and Lukianivska another station was originally planned, Vulytsia Hertsena, but, unlike Lvivska, only a provision was left. ==Present== Today the station exists as an empty carcass that can be seen from inside the trains Metro to Troieschyna, \\"The Wall of Yatsenyuk\\" and the Odesa-Reni highway. For what long-term construction all Ukraine is waiting for, Ukrayinska Pravda (3 May 2018), which slow as they pass . Both widened tunnels for the platform halls are done, however most of the passages to the central hall are still not opened, and the central hall itself is only partially bored through. The original architectural image of the station was to be on par with Lukianivska, both symbolising a break with Soviet past and a Ukrainian future. The theme for Lvivska Brama would be orientated on Western Ukraine (which would fit in with the name) consisting of sharp contrasting colour tones. The pylon portals would feature additional white vaults joining at the base of the pylons. Contrasting with this would be the black internal pylon passages. The floor will be arranged in a symmetrical cross pattern of red, white and black granite. It is unclear whether the project has been altered since, although this is unlikely. At present Lvivska Brama square requires a major reconstruction and redevelopment potentially raising the area's significance for transport and certainly commerce. Once that is done the need for the station will be justified. In its present state, a period from nine months to year will be enough to fully complete the station for opening, without any disruption to the service of the line. At present Kyiv City administration is searching for an investor to fund the reconstruction of the square. However, at the same time, the Kyiv Metro construction (KyivMetroStroy) has other priorities, mainly the Holosiyiv radius and the Podilsko-Voskresenska Line, which are much more significant than Lvivska Brama. Nonetheless in early 2007 it has been emerged that the contractor was found. A Lviv based Zubr company which was to rebuild the square would also be now forced to complete the station with an opening date of 2010.Glavred 6 April 2007 Construction of the station resumed in July 2008. As of May 2012, the station had not been completed due to further construction delays. ==See also== * Telychka, another unfinished station of the Syretsko-Pecherska Line ==References== ==External links== * Photograph * Photograph * Google Maps – Satellite shot on the Lvivska Brama square Category:Proposed or under construction Kiev Metro stations ","title":"Lvivska Brama (Kyiv Metro)"},{"id":"7791005","text":"Rocket 88 was a United Kingdom-based boogie-woogie band formed in the late 1970s by Ian \\"Stu\\" Stewart, Charlie Watts, Alexis Korner and Dick Morrissey.Wood, Ronnie Ronnie: The Autobiography Macmillan, 2007 The band is named after the 1948 Pete Johnson instrumental \\"Rocket 88 Boogie\\" and is also the title of their 1981 live album, recorded by the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio.

It is initiated by the Cervical (of the neck region) spinal nerve 7 nerve root (the small segment of the nerve that emerges from the spinal cord). The reflex is tested as part of the neurological examination to assess the sensory and motor pathways within the C7 and C8 spinal nerves. ==Testing== The test can be performed by tapping the triceps tendonA tendon is a strip or sheet of connective tissue that transmits the force generated by the contraction of muscle to the bone by attaching with it. Thus, in simple words, a tendon attaches a muscle to a bone with the sharp end of a reflex hammer while the forearm is hanging loose at a right angle to the arm. A sudden contraction of the triceps muscle causes extension,A straightening at the elbow joint) of the forearm and indicates a normal reflex. == Reflex arc == The arc involves the stretch receptors in the triceps tendon, from where the information travels through the C7/C8 nerve root to the spinal cord, and the motor signal for contraction returns through the radial nerve.A reflex arc is the path in the nervous system through which the sensory information (stimulation--sudden stretching of the triceps tendon in this case) travels to the spinal cord in form of an action potential through a sensory neuron, and comes in contact with a motor neuron at a synapse, which also carries an action potential back to the muscle of origin and results in its (triceps's) contraction. Note that the contact between the sensory and motor neurons does not require immediate involvement of the brain making it involuntary, though the sensation of stretch (as the hammer hits the skin and tendon beneath) and contraction of the muscle are both sent to the brain making the subject aware of the entire testing procedure. ==Test indicators== * Absence of a reflex (areflexia): If no reflex is elicited then it is essential to try again with reinforcement, with the patient clenching his or her teeth just as the reflex hammer strikes. * Hyper-reflexia (a response far larger than considered normal): Indicates a potential upper motor neuron lesion. ==Absence of reflex== An absence of reflex can be an indicator of several medical conditions: Myopathy, neuropathy, spondylosis, sensory nerve disease, neuritis, potential lower motor neuron lesion, or poliomyelitis.

It lies on the east side of the River Taff opposite Abercanaid, south of Merthyr and north of Troedyrhiw. To the east of the village lies the Mynydd Cilfach-yr-Encil which rises up to . Pentrebach is part of the Plymouth electoral ward which covers Pentrebach, Abercanaid and Troedyrhiw. The village was founded at the time that John Guest built the Plymouth Ironworks in 1763. The name Guest became part of the Guest, Keen and Nettelfold company (GKN). In 1818 Anthony Hill took over ownership of the business. His House was later used as an old people's home, and today has been converted into a Brewers Fayre Restaurant with a Premier Inn attached. Merthyr Tramroad tunnel The original Merthyr Tramroad, built in 1802, ran alongside the site of the modern day village, on its way from penydarren to Abercynon, though very little of the village had been built at that time. A tunnel still exists, which can be visited on the Merthyr Road. Locomotives had to tip their chimneys while going through this tunnel due to the tunnel clearance. Pentrebach has its own railway station. This opened in 1886 on the standard gauge Taff Vale Railway which runs from Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil alongside the River Taff. The original purpose of the railway was to carry iron ore to Cardiff Docks. In 1862, on the south side of the village, The South Duffryn Colliery was opened with two shafts which were deep. At the height of the production there were some 1300 men employed there. An opencast mine was also located on the mountainside above the village. The Plymouth Ironworks closed in 1882 and the South Duffryn Colliery ceased production in 1940. Hoover washing machine factory After the war, new industries were attracted to the village. In 1945, the Kayser Bondor Factory opened making underwear, followed in 1948 by the establishment of the Hoover factory manufacturing washing machines. The factory later produced the Sinclair C5 battery-powered three-wheeler car. On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it was to cease production of washing machines and other laundry products at the factory. Linde set up a factory in the village on a site where the South Duffryn Colliery was located. This plant manufactured Forklift and at one time employed circa 500 people. The plant closed in 2013. but the site has since been taken over by U.S. defence contractor General Dynamics to produce armoured vehicles for the British Army. Pentrebach has two clubs: The Hills Plymouth Cricket Club, and the Pentrebach working men's club. Pentrebach also has a chapel, Jerusalem Chapel, Greenfield School and an Integrated Children's Centre. The mountain above Pentrebach has become popular with hang glider pilots in recent years. ==References== ==External links== *Old Merthyr Tydfil: Pentrebach Historical Photographs of Pentrebach. *National Library of Scotland - Old Maps of Pentrebach.

She was awarded the title Woman International Master by FIDE in 1970. ==Early life== Her father was a Brazilian businessman who went to Germany to study engineering. There he met and married Ruth's mother, afterwards bringing her to Brazil where Ruth was born in Salvador. Shortly after Ruth was born, her parents' marriage ended, and Ruth and her mother went to Germany. World War II broke out and Ruth and her mother spent the period in East Germany. When the war ended, the Soviet Army took over East Germany. Ruth would have been trapped there, except that she had dinner with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who saw to it that Ruth would be allowed to escape to Brazil. ==Career== Cardoso was, for many years, the strongest woman chess player in South America. She won the South American Women's Championship every time she competed (1966, 1969 and 1972). She won the Brazilian Chess Championship seven times. She played four times in the Women's Interzonal Championship. She played in five World Chess Olympiads, playing first board for the Brazilian team each time: in Skopje 1972, Medellín 1974, Buenos Aires 1976, La Valletta 1980, and Luzern 1982. Her trainer was grandmaster Pal Benko. She played chess in the United States for thirty years, mostly in open Swiss tournaments. She was a popular chess personality, who was always able to see the bright side in the worst possible situations. Cardoso was perhaps best known for playing in strong grandmaster tournaments in Spain and Italy in the 1970s. She played tournament games against grandmasters Ljubomir Ljubojević, Arturo Pomar, Jan Timman and Arthur Bisguier. She occasionally scored against the grandmasters, drawing with grandmasters Laszlo Barczay in Reggio Emilia 1970 and Miguel Quinteros in Malaga, Spain in 1971. In addition to being a chess player, she was an artist and a woodcutter. One confusing point which has often arisen is the similarity between her name and that of International Master Rodolfo Tan Cardoso of the Philippines. Rodolfo Cardoso became famous for playing a match against Bobby Fischer in 1957 and in the Interzonal in Portorož in 1958. As a result, when games played by R. Cardoso against grandmasters began being published in the 1970s, it was widely assumed that these were games played by Rodolfo Cardoso, whereas they were actually played by Ruth Cardoso. She is also sometimes confused with the wife of the former President of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose name is also Ruth Cardoso (Ruth Valença Correia Leite Cardoso). ==Personal life== Cardoso was married and divorced early in life and had no children. Her trainer, Benko, was also her long-time companion. She died of heart disease in her home city of Salvador. ==ReferencesInternational Tournament Record of Ruth Cardoso * Memorial Tournament to Ruth Cardoso in Brazil * US Tournament Record of Ruth Cardoso Category:1934 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Brazilian chess players Category:Chess woman International Masters Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Sportspeople from Salvador, Bahia Category:20th-century chess players ","title":"Ruth Volgl Cardoso"},{"id":"7791065","text":"David B.

It was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis in 1835 in the Greek Revival style common in America in that time period. It is his only surviving church in that style and is considered to be his latest building still standing that largely reflects his original vision.Aldrich, J. Winthrop; April 10, 2003; Foreword to Historic Structure Report; retrieved November 8, 2006 from newburghdrc.org. It is located at 132 Grand Street, just north of the Newburgh Free Library. Its historical importance comes from not just over a century of use as church, but its centrality in the struggle by modern preservationists to save and restore the city's many landmark buildings. Today it is a National Historic Landmark. It was almost razed in the late 1960s, and even today is far from completely restored. Property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. ==Description and site== The church is 50 feet (15 m) wide and high, and 100 feet (30.5 m) long. The four front Ionic order columns are 37 feet (12 m) high (the capitals have been removed for safety considerations at the moment). It sits on a bluff 250 feet (76 m) above the Hudson River, a few blocks away.October 17, 1835; \\"A Description of the Dutch Reformed Church Now Erecting in the Village of Newburgh\\"; Newburgh Gazette; as cited in Krattinger, William; April 10, 2003; History of the Dutch Reformed Church, retrieved from newburghdrc.org November 8, 2006. In the 1830s there were no other buildings in the vicinity to impede the view, so Davis saw it as symbolizing the city to the considerable river traffic of the time. The southward orientation of the columns and facade, the direction in which most shipping approached the city, was meant to echo the similar marine outreach of the Parthenon or the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion in Greece. An 1842 woodcut of Newburgh showing how the church (top, right) dominated the city's skyline during that time period. The original design included a small dome atop the roof, which Davis explained thus: It was removed a few years after the building was completed for structural reasons. Other additions were built on to the property by the church as its growth warranted. While the church had the neighborhood of Grand Avenue and Third Street to itself at the time of its construction, today it has become rather crowded. It is now a contributing property of the Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District, which includes other notable historic buildings such as the former Orange County Courthouse, another Greek Revival building (designed by locally prominent architect Thornton Niven) across the street, the library, several other large old churches (some still in use). Several blocks to the south, along Liberty Street, is another site of major historical interest — the Hasbrouck House, today preserved as Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site owing to its use for that purpose during the last years of the Revolutionary War. To the north the area becomes more residential but still includes some of the city's older and larger homes, although some have been allowed to deteriorate in the last several decades. The current siting both enhances and complicate its aesthetic position. On the former hand, most of the buildings around it are of similar historic value. On the latter, the brutalist library that sits cater corner from it is not only a serious contrast in styles, it blocks most of the view the river and the church once had of each other. The church, library and dilapidated former Metropolitan Club of Newburgh form a small plaza; however part of it is taken up by a small parking lot built by the Newburgh Enlarged City School District, which runs the library and is headquartered in it, for its own central office employees. ==History== The building's history can be divided into two eras: its actual use as a church from 1835 to 1967, and the attempts to preserve and refurbish it since then. ===Church era=== In 1834 the Rev. William Cruickshank was sent upriver from New York City by Dutch Reformed Church elders to start a new church.Dutch Reformed Church Restoration Committee; undated; Early History; newburghdrc.org; retrieved November 5, 2006. He commissioned Davis for the design and the cornerstone was laid the following year. It was completed and dedicated two years later. But by 1839, the church had to mortgage the building to pay construction costs, and the dome and its lantern were removed in 1843. The mortgage payments did not prevent the church from expanding the property, with a small parsonage being erected on the southeast corner in 1852, where the library now stands. Seven years later, the mortgage was paid off. The church put the money it could now spend more freely to work on the structure, adding a pastor's study and recessed pulpit and repainting the interior (not completely enough; some of the original stenciled Greek motifs are still visible today). After the Civil War, the congregation had reached 290 members. It was able to add 20 feet (6 m) onto the north side of the building, complete with transepts designed by George Harney, and purchase an organ. By 1882, it had grown to 400 members and paid off all its outstanding debt. The church would get a new roof two years later, followed a decade after that by a replacement organ and pulpit. The first years of the 20th century saw it get some electric lights, and another new roof. In 1909 an iron fence was built with money paid to the church by the city for the use of its lawn during the previous year's Fulton-Hudson celebration. The following year cement replaced wood as the flooring material for the portico, and in 1920 all lighting in the building became electric when the chandeliers switched from gas. Damage from the 1950 hurricane For the first time in its history, the church would finally take a stable form. No major work beyond routine repair was done until after World War II, when various storms damaged the roof. However, in 1950 a hurricane blew the roof completely off. While the church was able to repair it and in fact make further improvements such as adding telephone service and a public address system, the years had taken their toll and in 1964 the congregation had acquired land in the Town of Newburgh on which to build a new edifice. Three years later, they deconsecrated Davis's building and moved out. ===Preservation era=== thumb thumb It was soon slated for demolition as part of the city's urban renewal efforts. Helen Gearn, the city's historian at the time, urged that it be preserved and somehow reused. After a feasibility study concluded it could be done, the \\"Palatine Square\\" proposal for the blocks in the immediate vicinity included the church.Dutch Reformed Church Restoration Committee; undated ; Later History; newburghdrc.org; retrieved November 6, 2006. Nevertheless, the next year the city claimed the church as an urban- renewal parcel, and the next year its Urban Renewal Agency paid $96,000 for it. Public efforts against its demolition led to the church's addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, which meant that federal funds could no longer be used to demolish it. Newburgh had in the past taken the lead in historic preservation when Washington's Headquarters had become the first officially designated historic site in the U.S. in 1850. The battle to save the church revived this tradition and marked the beginning of the city's modern historic preservation movement. Orange County expressed interest in buying the building as part of the \\"Courthouse Square\\" project, a proposal to redevelop the area around the courthouse just across the street, which served as Ulster County's when Newburgh was that county's seat prior to the redrawing of county boundaries that followed the creation of Rockland County in 1798. At the time, the county was still using the courthouse as a branch of the main county courts in Goshen. The Hudson Valley Philharmonic also looked into making the church its home. The state's Office of Historic Preservation designated a historic district in nearby downtown areas of the city, but it did not include the church. The Greater Newburgh Arts Council continued working to save the church. While the building was safe for the time being, its exterior, particularly the columns, were in an advanced state of decay. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development which administered the city's urban-renewal grants, ordered in 1974 that it be either razed or sold. The city bought it for $7,000. Three years later the Hudson Valley Freedom Theater (HVFT) bought the building, hoping to make it a playhouse. The purchase was conditioned on the theater company being able to renovate the structure within a certain time. The National Park Service repaired the roof. In 1984 the theater company defaulted on its contract and title reverted to the city. The following year the state expanded the city's historic district to include the church, while the NPS removed the column's Ionic capitals. The 1990s saw the beginning of piecemeal efforts to restore the church. Another city historian, Kevin Barrett, called for the building's preservation in 1994, and the Council on the Arts intensified its efforts. It was suggested that the city or private donors restore one of the original columns, as a way of demonstrating that the restoration of the whole church, though a considerable task, was not impossible. Hillary Clinton, then First Lady, spoke in front of the church before a large crowd on July 14, 1998 as part of the Save America's Treasures tour. The $128,205 federal grant received as part of that program paid to stabilize the church's upper gallery, which was then in imminent danger of collapse.Save America's Treasures; June 1999; Project Profile:Dutch Reformed Church; saveamericastreasures.org; retrieved November 6, 2006. The 21st century began with two events that signaled the struggle over the church was not now for its preservation but its restoration. The Dutch Reformed Church Restoration Committee was formed by local activist Carla Decker, former president of the Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Hudson Highlands, in 2000 and the next year became part of the Newburgh Preservation Association. On August 7, 2001, the church was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior after a successful application by state preservation official William Krattinger., and A state grant made possible the repair and restoration of the church's drainage system and west foundation wall.Dutch Reformed Church Restoration Committee; undated; Foundation Work '03; newburghdrc.org; retrieved November 6, 2006. The picket fence was repainted in 2004, and the following year the World Monuments Fund put the church on its list of the 100 Most Endangered Sites.World Monuments Fund; World Monuments Watch: 100 Most Endangered Sites 2006 , retrieved November 6, 2006. However, the work has not been enough to arrest ongoing structural decay. In 2012 much of the ceiling collapsed. Wood and plaster debris are, , still scattered all over the floor. The west wall has also begun to show cracks as it sinks into the poorly drained underlying soil. ==Future projects== The church in February 2006, with a restored column Today, efforts to restore the church to its original glory continue. The DRCRC is actively involved in raising money for those efforts and promoting the church's historical importance. In 2002 the NPA commissioned the Albany firm Mesick Cohen Wilson Baker to do a Historic Structure Report summarizing what needed to be done to restore the building.

Leaving Oxford without a degree, Holtby proceeded to the English College at Douay, where he arrived by way of Antwerp, in August 1577, and was received into the Roman Catholic Church. He was ordained priest at Cambrai on 29 March 1578. The college was relocated to Reims, where Holtby continued his theological studies until February 1579, when he was sent on the English mission. He returned to England, probably on a merchant ship belonging to the Hodgsons of Hebburn. The Hodgsons regularly gave passage to priests from the continent to Shields, Hebburn, and Newcastle. After resting at Hebburn Hall they were passed on to other \\"safe houses\\" in the North. Holtby was a capable gardner, mason, and carpenter. A skilled mechanic, he constructed many cleverly contrived hiding-places for the persecuted priests. He could also ply the needle to make vestments and altar-cloths. In 1581, Father Edmund Campion paid him a visit, and while staying in his house composed the famous Decem Rationes and urged him to join the Society of Jesus. Richard entered the Society of Jesus in 1583 and crossed the English Channel to participate in his Spiritual Exercises with Father Thomas Derbyshire. He fulfilled the requirements of his noviceship at Verdun and continued on to Pont-à-Mousson to continue his studies. There he was one of three out of thirteen contemporaries who survived the black plague. After four years spent studying theology at the University of Pont-à-Mousson, he was appointed superior of the Scots College there, in about 1587.Morris, John. The Catholics of York under Elizabeth, p. 112 ==Mission in England== The father-general, Aquaviva, sent him back to England in 1589. From 1593 to about 1605, Holtby worked in the northern counties. Much of that time he spent in the house of John Trollope in Thornley, Durham. On one occasion, Holtby and his host's eldest son were returning from a baptism at some distance, when they saw that the house was being searched. As they had been observed by the pursuivants, they had to flee on foot and hide in the woods for two days. In 1603 he was professed of the four vows. After the execution of Father Henry Garnett he was appointed superior or vice-prefect of the English mission, and during his three years’ tenure of that office he appears to have resided in London. When the question of the new oath of allegiance to James I was proposed, and the archpriest George Blackwell declared that it might be conscientiously taken by Catholics, Holtby at first forbade the Jesuits to write or preach against the oath, while leaving them free to give private advice on the subject; but after the condemnation of the oath by Pope Paul V he denounced it. ==Later life and death== On vacating his office he returned to the north of England, where he exercised much influence among the Catholics. A government spy in a report to the privy council in 1593 describes him as \\"a little man, with a reddish bearde\\", and adds that he chiefly resided at Mr. Trollope’s house at Thornley, co. Durham. In order to evade arrest he assumed the aliases of Andrew Ducket, Robert North, and Richard Fetherston. One of his bases was Harbour House Farm near Chester-Le-Street owned by the Forcer family.\\"St. Cuthbert’s Parish History\\", St. Cuthbert's Parish, Chester-le-Street, County Durham In 1602–3 he was at Heborne, the residence of Mr. Hodgson, three miles from Newcastle; and in 1605–6 he was at Halton, Northumberland, the seat of Lancelot Carnaby. He died in the Durham district on 14 May (O.S.) 1640. \\"Of no other English Jesuit\\", remarks Dr. Jessopp, \\"can it be said that he exercised his vocation in England for upwards of fifty years, and that, too, with extraordinary effect and ceaseless activity, without once being thrown into gaol or once falling into the hands of pursuivants; and quietly died in his bed in extreme old age.\\" Richard died in England on 25 May 1640, aged 87. ==His works== *On the Persecution in the North, 1594 manuscript at Stonyhurst College, printed by John Morris in Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers, iii. 103-219, and partially printed in Dodd’s Catholic History,’ ed.

He was the son of Huntington Wolcott Merchant (c.1870–1918) and Mary Cornelia (née Tallmadge) Merchant, who lived at 1172 Park Avenue in New York City. His sister was Elizabeth Wolcott \\"Betty\\" Merchant (b. 1902), who married Philip Gallatin Cammann. He was a descendant on his father's side of Oliver Wolcott Jr., the second Secretary of the Treasury under George Washington following Alexander Hamilton. Through his mother, he was descended from Sir Thomas Tallmadge, who emigrated to the colonies in 1632, Benjamin Tallmadge, and Gen. William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His maternal grandparents were Chester Livingston Tallmadge and Fanny Amelia Hamilton. Merchant was educated at the Hotchkiss School in 1922 and Princeton in 1926, where he was a member of the University Cottage Club and the Board of Trustees of Princeton University. ==Career== He joined Scudder Stevens and Clark, an investment counselling firm. He became a general partner in 1930.* Following his successful business career, Merchant joined the Government in 1942 following the attack on Pearl Harbor and moved up in the U.S. Department of State during the height of the Cold War. In 1949, when the Chiang Kai-shek regime collapsed, Merchant was in Nanking, China to assist. In the early 1950s, he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs (under Dean Rusk who served as Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs and Dean Acheson, then US Secretary of State) in the Truman administration.* He was twice appointed as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. In 1959, he was appointed Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, succeeding his former boss, Robert Daniel Murphy. He was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. In 1961, while Ambassador, President Kennedy appointed Merchant as his personal representative to negotiate the border dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1964, he co-authored the Merchant-Heeney Report which examined bilateral relations between Canada and the United States. In his obituary in The New York Times, Merchant was described by the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and the late President Eisenhower as \\"the ideal of a Foreign Service officer.\\" ===Later work=== In 1963, he served as a director of the Glen Falls Insurance Company. In 1965, after having left the Government, he became executive director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a position he held from August 11, 1965 until October 31, 1968. Also in 1968, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Harvard University that cited \\"in a long career, this discerning diplomat has advanced the interests of our country with faithfulness and distinction.\\" ==Personal life== On December 11, 1927, Merchant was married to Elizabeth Stiles (b. 1904) at the Bethlehem Chapel at the Washington National Cathedral.

A keyboard input button factory reset is used to restore the device to its original manufacturer settings. Doing so will effectively erase all of the data, settings, and applications that were previously on the device. This is often done to fix an issue with a device, but it could also be done to restore the device to its original settings. Such electronic devices include smartphones. Since a factory reset entails deleting all information stored in the device, it is essentially the same concept as reformatting a hard drive. Pre-installed applications and data on the card's storage card (such as a microSD card) will not be erased. A factory reset effectively destroys all data stored in the unit. Factory resets can fix many chronic performance issues (i.e. freezing), but it does not remove the device's operating system. == Examples == Factory resets can be achieved in a variety of ways depending on the electronic device. For some devices, this could be done by going into the device's Service Menu. Other devices may require a complete re-installation of the software. The following section lists a few common electronic devices and how they can be reset to factory settings. Computer factory resets will restore the computer to the computer's original operating system and delete all of the user data stored on the computer. Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows 10, and Apple's macOS have options for this. On Android devices, there is a factory data reset option in Settings that will appear to erase all of the device's data and reset all of its settings. This method is typically used when the device has a technical problem that cannot be fixed using other methods, or when the owner wants to remove all their personal data before selling, giving away, returning or disposing of the device. After performing a study, Avast! reported that the data is recoverable using forensics software that is fairly generic and publicly available. The \\"Factory data reset\\" option does not affect the Knox Flag. As such, it does not reset the device to its original factory settings and is not a way to return the device to a state compatible with the manufacturer's warranty. Data on the SIM card and the microSD card is not erased. Many other devices can be restored to factory settings, like televisions, GPS units or tablet computers. Many electronic devices have a menu with tools and settings called the service menu, which commonly includes a tool that performs a factory reset.

The plan suggests an exchange of populated territoriesterritories populated by both Arabs and Jewsbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Lieberman maintains that everywhere in the world where there are two peoples with two religions a conflict exists and notes that in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the situation is worse as there is not only a religious conflict but also a nationalistic one. Therefore, the proposition is based on 'reduction of conflict' and maintains that the two peoples could live together but it would make no sense to have one living inside the other. On top of this, Lieberman maintains that it makes no sense to create a Palestinian state that has no Jewish people while Israel is turned into a dual-population state with more than 20% of minorities. In general, Arab Israelis are opposed to the plan and many believe it constitutes racism. The Israeli left opposes the plan. Legal experts have cast doubt on the legality of such a move under Israeli and international law. == The plan == The Lieberman Plan suggests a territorial exchange whereby Israel would annex almost all Israeli settlements in the West Bank which are situated in major settlement blocs close to the border, and withdraw from the remaining few deep inside the Palestinian territories. At the same time, it would transfer Arab-Israeli areas to the Palestinian state. While there are three major Arab regions in Israel, all contiguous with the West Bank (southern and central Galilee, the central region known as \\"the Triangle\\", and the Bedouin region in the northern part of the Negev desert), the Lieberman Plan only advocates ceding the Triangle. All Arab residents of the Triangle would lose their Israeli citizenship. The Druze community, whose leaders are mainly pro- Israel, would remain part of Israel. All remaining citizens, whether Jews or Arabs would have to pledge an oath of allegiance to the state in order to keep their Israeli citizenship. Video including Lieberman's position on Arabs in Israel. The plan would reduce both the Arab population of Israel and the Jewish population of the West Bank, creating more ethnically homogeneous states without anyone moving. Various estimates as to the number of Arab- Israelis affected by the plan vary from a high of 90% of current Arab Israelis in Lieberman's own estimate to as little as 11.8% of Arab citizens being affected (2.3% of Israel's population overall) according to a study by the Floersheimer Institute for Policy Studies. === Lieberman's argument for the plan === Lieberman's main argument for the plan is that it is not a population transfer, since the plan does not call for any forcible removal of anyone from their home. The plan, instead, simply redraws the border between Palestinian and Israeli communities to make them more homogeneous (i.e., nearby Arab communities are redrawn to be included in the Palestinian Territory, while nearby Jewish territories are redrawn to be included in Israel). In an open Q&A; with Haaretz, Lieberman noted that it is of great importance to have a partner in the Arab side and stated that he communicated his plan to the Palestinians and the Arab states prior to making it public in Israel. Lieberman stated his belief that the Arab world understands that his plan would be in the benefit of the region and cited that there were no denunciations from either the Palestinians or the Arab world to this plan. == Poll of Umm Al-Fahm residents == A 2000 poll conducted by the Arab-language weekly Kul Al-Arab in Um Al-Fahm found that an 83% majority opposed having their town transferred to Palestinian rule, with only 11% in favor. == Views of the Islamic Movement == The deputy leader of the Islamic Movement's northern branch, Sheikh Kamel Khatib, said of the Lieberman plan that the only acceptable population exchange for him would be for the Russian-born Lieberman to: \\"return to his country while refugees in Syria and Lebanon return to their homeland\\". == Feasibility == According to Timothy Waters, \\"objections about feasibility ... are really not based on a belief that transfer is impossible, but a conviction that it is undesirable\\". The Plan conforms with generalized support both inside and outside of Israel for a two-state solution. Supporters within Israel seek a state that is both democratic and Jewish, the Lieberman Plan would achieve this goal. For those that believe that the ideal solution to the Israel-Arab conflict would be greater separation between Jews and Arabs, this plan would certainly achieve such a goal. The Plan also minimizes the population of the minority in each state, which can be viewed (in the case of either minority) as \\"untrustworthy, unwanted, destabilizing, disruptive or simply different\\". Demographically the plan creates two States which are more ethnically homogeneous, and likely would achieve the political goals of both the Palestinian and Israeli leadership. In sum, according to Waters: \\"It is entirely plausible that the Plan could contribute to peace, if peace could be achieved through a greater separation of Jews and Palestinians. That is, after all, the assumption underlying all two-state solutions.\\" However, most assumptions about feasibility, including Waters', assume that the Plan would result from a multi-lateral agreement. At the present, there does not seem to be support for it from a willing Palestinian partner, thus decreasing the likelihood that it would be successful in achieving peace. == Legality == Several issues of legality arise under the Lieberman Plan: the transfer of territory, revoking the citizenship of a people (i.e., the Arabs) – either through transfer of territory or a loyalty oath, and the gaining of new territory (settlement blocs in the West Bank). Timothy Waters writes that the plan can be creatively imagined as a secession – as if Israel was seceding from its present borders to smaller borders where the Jews have a larger majority. === Transfer of territory === Generally speaking, land transfer, as opposed to population transfer, is legal under both International and Israeli law. The Israeli precedent was exemplified in 1979 when Israel agreed to transfer the Sinai Desert in exchange for peace with Egypt. The issue that arises with this plan is the transfer of populated territories and the revocation of citizenship for those in the transferred areas. Even this, in principle, seems to be legal under international law. === Revocation of citizenship through transfer of territory === A number of legal experts questioned by The Jerusalem Post in 2006 argued that stripping Israeli Arabs of citizenship as part of a population and territorial swap with the Palestinian Authority would \\"run counter to Israeli and international law\\". They stated that Israel could decide that the \\"Triangle\\", which is populated mostly by Israeli Arabs, is no longer part of Israel but that she could not revoke the citizenship of the people living there. However, others questioned in the same report, including parliamentary and constitutional law teacher, Suzie Navot, argued that the legality of the plan was unclear, and would likely need a ruling from the High Court of Justice to determine its legality. Yisrael Beiteinus legal adviser Yoav Many believes the plan is legal and \\"would be accepted not just in Israel but also within the international community\\". Timothy Waters writes that the plan, contrary to many arguments, is not an example of ethnic cleansing nor apartheid since it does not move any Arab from their land. He writes that states have the right to transfer (or withdraw from) territory, even against the wishes of the population, or to revoke the citizenship of inhabitants. The Lieberman Plan advocates the affected Arab Israelis to become citizens of Palestine, not stateless, and hence doesn't violate 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Waters also argues that while a state cannot strip an entire ethnic group of their citizenship, it may practice some forms of ethnic discrimination \\"because ethnicity plays an accepted role in constructing citizenship\\". He points to the expulsion of black Senegalese from Mauritania, the stripping of northern Muslims of their citizenship by Côte d'Ivoire and the denationalization of Germans from Czechoslovakia (whose legality, he says, was later upheld in courts). Waters also argues that while the transfer of Israeli Arabs to a Palestinian state would harm their interests (e.g. reduction in standard of life) it doesn't violate any of their human rights. While there are international precedents for the idea of populated land exchange, and international law seems to be favorable, there is no such precedent under Israeli law. Scholars tend to agree that the plan is, at best, questionable under Israeli law. Currently, there is no Israeli law which would deal with this issue. In order for it to be implemented, the Knesset would have to enact legislation, and the High Court of Justice would rule on its legality. It is unlikely that either International or Israeli law would allow revocation of citizenship without a bilateral agreement with the Palestinian Authority. === Revocation of citizenship through a citizenship oath === Individuals who would prefer to remain in Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state would be able to move to Israel. All citizens of Israel would be required to swear a loyalty oath to retain citizenship. Those who refuse could remain in Israel as permanent residents. The loyalty oath would apply to all citizens regardless of ethnicity. According to Timothy Waters \\"the loyalty oath almost certainly violates international law.\\" The rationale behind this is that international law sees citizenship as an automatic right. Furthermore, those who refused to take the oath would be stateless, unlike those transferred under the population exchange part of the plan. === Annexation of West Bank settlements === Timothy Waters writes that while Israel does have the right to unilaterally withdraw its borders from Arab territory, it cannot unilaterally take territory in the West Bank (in particular the Israeli settlements there). While it would be legitimate for a sovereign Palestine to transfer territory to Israeli control, Palestine would be under no obligation to do so. Waters bases this on the argument that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, constitute occupied territory. == Criticism == === Moral arguments === Most criticisms of the plan focus on the undesirability of separation as opposed to its infeasibility. Many Arab citizens of Israel have criticized the plan as being racist and are, in general, opposed to it. While the plan would not require them to leave their homes, Arabs in Israel argue that they are native to the region and insist that as Israeli citizens, they deserve equal rights within the state, and should not be singled out by ethnic or religious background. Various polls show that Arabs in Israel in general do not wish to move to the West Bank or Gaza if a Palestinian state is created there. Several Israeli left-wing commentators have argued against the plan as well. Jewish critics sympathetic to the idea of exchanging populated territories have argued that it would be preferable to do this as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. They point out that while Arabs under the plan would still be allowed to retain Israeli citizenship if they take an oath of allegiance, no reciprocal possibility exists. Akiva Eldar of Haaretz has said that the plan undermines the moral high ground of Israel. Haaretz has argued that the plan \\"is nothing but polite packaging that does not succeed in concealing its real aspiration: delegitimizing all the Arab citizens of Israel\\". Daniel Gordis wrote that the plan's implementation would be highly demoralizing to those Arabs who would not be removed and might give them the sense that Israel does not want them. Gordis argued that this could set back any attempt to build better relations with the Israeli-Arab community. However, he acknowledged that they may already believe that Israel doesn't want them and are unlikely to embrace Israel as a Jewish state, and that nothing Israel does will convince them otherwise. === Strategic arguments === Other pro-Arab commentators have expressed skepticism that such a land-and-population transfer would result in the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and, hence, IDF soldiers, from areas of Israeli residence in the Lieberman-envisioned Palestinian state. Another concern is that Israeli zones within the West Bank will be subject to a security threat, putting the IDF at high risk to defend them. == References == Category:Demographics of Israel Category:Israeli–Palestinian peace process Category:Two-state solution ","title":"Lieberman Plan"},{"id":"7791187","text":"Maestro Chev. Carmelo Pace (August 17, 1906 – May 20, 1993) was a Maltese composer, and a professor of music theory and harmony. Born in Valletta, Malta on August 17, 1906, Pace was the eldest of three children. His parents were Anthony Pace and Maria Carmela née Ciappara. ==Education== In his childhood, Pace's family lived in an apartment on Strada Mercanti, Valletta, which they shared with his maternal uncle, Vincenzo Ciappara. Ciappara was himself a musician of some repute, and he was Pace's earliest tutor. Pace attended Saint Augustine College in Valletta, where he became very active in the student choir. During frequent visits to his father's workplace at the Commerce movie theatre on Strada Reale in Valletta, Pace became enamoured of the impromptu style of live musical accompaniment played by the resident quartet during screenings of silent films. He soon became a regular player at the movie theatre. Following an introduction by his uncle, Pace took up the violin under the tutelage of Prof. Carlo Fiamingo, and studied harmony, counterpoint, orchestration and composition under Thomas Mayne. In 1931, he received a Diploma in Musical Instruction from the Royal School of Music, London, and promptly took in several students.Joe M. Miceli, \\"Surmastrijiet\\", in Baned Maltin/Ghawdxin u Barranin ==The War Years== His early career was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. With Malta under near constant bombardment by the Axis powers, Pace was appointed Shelter Supervisor with responsibility over more than five hundred refugees, and subsequently took a position as a clerk in the Royal Air Force offices in Valletta. As the War raged on, Pace resumed teaching after hours, and even founded a small orchestra for the entertainment of refugees.Joe Julian Farrugia, \\"Ulied is- seklu l-ieħor\\", in It-Torċa (24 August 2003) The Pace family abandoned their Valletta home after it was demolished by aerial bombardment, and relocated to the town of Sliema on the opposite shore of Marsamxett Harbour. ==Musical Works== By the time he was 20, Pace had composed suites for piano, violin and violoncello, followed by numerous cantatas, orchestral and chamber music, sacred hymns, two ballets, band marches, concertos, and an oratorio. His 1931 composition, Maltesina, a musical fantasy based largely on traditional Maltese folk tunes and għana, was premiered by the Highland Fusiliers' Band in Palace Square. It remains a popular choice among marching bands during Malta's village festa season. Among his most notable works are four operas, all of which are based on Maltese history, legend and folklore. Caterina Desguanez (1965), libretto by Ivo Muscat Azzopardi, tells the story of a Turkish slave who falls in love with his master's daughter. I Martiri (1967), libretto by Vincenzo Maria Pellegrini, features the uprising against the French occupiers in Napoleonic Malta. Angelica (1973), libretto also by Vincenzo Maria Pellegrini, is based on the Maltese legend of the Bride of Mosta. Ipogeana (1976), libretto by Pellegrini, is about Neolithic Malta during the age of the mysterious temple builders. In 1982 he composed the Stabat Mater for soprano, tenor, bass, mixed choir and orchestra. This was premiered by the St Monica Choir, under the direction of Sister Beniamina Portelli. Pace achieved international recognition when his symphonic poem Jubilamus was played by the Kyoto Symphonic Orchestra during Expo '70 in Japan. His works have also been played in the United States, Russia, England, Wales, France, Italy, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Egypt, India and Argentina. Carmelo Pace's music is often melodious, but at times quite characteristic of the early 20th century music tendencies. In his more lyrical moments, his music shows some references to verisim as well as Ravelian harmonies. Often of an intimate character, his more adventurous language is more abstract and atonal without necessarily being dodecaphonic. ==Honours and awards== In 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958, Pace took first place in Rediffusion's annual international contest for musical composition. He won a chamber music contest organized by the Performing Rights Society in London in 1962 and again in 1972. In 1975, he took both first and second place in a chamber music contest organized by the Manoel Theatre in Valletta. In 1964, he was created a Knight of the Sovereign, Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem (the Order of Malta), and in 1992, President Vincent Tabone made him an Officer of the National Order of Merit. ==Archives== Following Pace's death, on May 20, 1993, his manuscripts and other works were transferred to the Cathedral Museum in Mdina, although the musical scores to his operas remain at the Manoel Theatre Museum in Valletta. ==References== Category:Male classical composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Maltese classical composers Category:Maltese composers Category:Maltese opera composers Category:1993 deaths Category:1906 births Category:People from Valletta Category:Recipients of the National Order of Merit (Malta) Category:20th-century classical composers Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Carmelo Pace"},{"id":"7791199","text":"James Wolfe Ripley (December 10, 1794 – March 16, 1870) was an American soldier who served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War. In 1861, he was selected to be the 5th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. He was instrumental in the early days of the war in modernizing the artillery's ordnance. However, Ripley also delayed the introduction of repeating firearms, particularly the Gatling gun and the Spencer rifle, into U.S. arsenals, an act that has been widely criticized by later historians. ==Biography== Ripley was born in Windham County, Connecticut. He graduated at West Point in 1814, was commissioned second lieutenant of artillery, and took part in the defense of Sacketts Harbor. In 1817–18 he served under Jackson during the Seminole War and the invasion of Florida as a first lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in 1825. In 1832-1833, Ripley commanded the Federal forces in Charleston harbor at the time of the nullification movement in South Carolina. He was promoted to major of ordnance in 1838. He commanded the Kennebec Arsenal between 1833 and 1842.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . pp. 404–405 He then became superintendent of the Springfield Armory (1842–1854), regarded by some historians as \\"Ripley's Monument.\\" Here he improved the buildings and grounds, increased production while reducing costs, and was instrumental in developing the 1855 model .58 caliber rifled musket which was later to be the principal weapon for Union infantrymen during the Civil War. He was unpopular in some quarters because of his insistence that Army regulations be followed and abuses in the workplace be curbed, but he received consistent support from his superiors because of his outstanding accomplishments. In 1854 he was transferred to the Watertown Arsenal as commandant of the facility, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Then he was chief of ordnance of the Pacific Coast Department and inspector of arsenals. With the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Ripley was promoted to colonel (April) and brigadier general (August) and appointed as the 5th Chief of Ordnance of the United States Army. As the Federal forces then had no heavy rifled cannon, he immediately ordered the conversion of old smoothbores and the manufacture of Parrott guns. He also ordered the sale of 5,000 old Hall's carbine rifles, which were later resold at a tremendous profit to John C. Frémont, much to Ripley's consternation. At the same time, Ripley refused to authorize the purchase of additional stocks of rifle-muskets for infantry use. The decision was based on the large existing stocks of smoothbore muskets in U.S. arsenals, which he argued could be re-rifled in the same manner as the Parrott guns (an assertion which proved incorrect). He also adamantly opposed the introduction of breech-loading repeating rifles, on the basis that they would encourage poor fire discipline and waste ammunition. Many historians have since decried this decision, arguing the lack of modern arms on the Union side, at a time when the Confederates were buying them in large numbers from France and the United Kingdom, lengthened the conflict by as much as two years. Others, however, counter that given the poor logistics of the Union armies at the outbreak of the war, the increased supply train needed to maintain the improved rates of fire would have bogged down the armies and made maneuver impossible (a situation which did indeed later contribute to the development of trench warfare in World War I). It is also argued that fouling due to black powder residue would have made it impossible to maintain such high rates of fire under field conditions with the rifles of the time. Individual units later purchased such weapons privately, and they were used to considerable effect, but did indeed present problems in extended firefights; these units are not known to have had any trouble maintaining their ammunition supplies. Ripley was replaced as head of the Ordnance Department on September 15, 1863 principally because of his continuing opposition to the introduction of breech loading rifles.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 454 From September 15, 1863 to the year of his death, he was inspector of fortifications on the New England coast, having retired from active service. On March 8, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Ripley to the grade of brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 14, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 708 James Wolfe Ripley died on March 16, 1870 in Hartford, Connecticut. He is buried in Springfield, Massachusetts. His nephew, Roswell S. Ripley, was a Confederate brigadier general during the Civil War. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==Notes== ==References== * Eicher, John H., and David J.

As a freeman and landowner within Welsh society he was not, like most of his contemporaries, dependent upon patronage. Dafydd was the bardic disciple of Maredudd ap Rhys and was in turn, the bardic tutor of Tudur Aled and Gutun Owain. ==Poetry== The main themes of Dafydd’s poetry were love and nature in the tradition of Dafydd ap Gwilym. His best-known poems include the following cywyddau: :*Cywydd Merch (\\"To a girl\\") :*I Wallt Merch (\\"A lady’s hair\\") :*Enwi’r Ferch (\\"Naming the girl\\") Unlike many of his contemporaries, such as Guto'r Glyn or Lewys Glyn Cothi, Dafydd eschewed the Wars of the Roses and politics. However, Dafydd was moved to compose an elegy for his friend, the harpist Siôn Eos, who was hanged for killing a man in a tavern brawl. In this, arguably his finest poem, Dafydd expresses his own anti-English sentiment, and regrets that Siôn Eos could not have been tried under the more humane Laws of Hywel Dda, resulting in compensation being paid to the victim’s family under the old Welsh law rather than the capital punishment of “cyfraith Lundain” (\\"London’s law\\"). :*Marwnad Siôn Eos (\\"The Death of Sion Eos\\") ==1450 eisteddfod and its legacy== In 1450 Dafydd won the silver chair at an eisteddfod held at Carmarthen. This was achieved with a cywydd in praise of the Trinity, which exemplified the 24 metres of Welsh bardic poetry reformed by Dafydd, previously codified by Einion Offeiriad and Dafydd Ddu o Hiraddug. He deleted two metres and replaced them with the more complicated Gorchest y Beirdd and the Cadwynfyr. The 24 metres presented by Dafydd at the eisteddfod became widely adopted throughout Wales. While the training of poets had always been kept within bardic circles, with the craft handed down from tutor to pupil, Dafydd’s reforms of the metres subsequently increased the segregation between the “professional elite” and the amateur poets. However the consequence of this, and of Dafydd in particular, was that greater emphasis was placed upon the bardic craft with its adherence to the stricter metres rather than on the content and theme of the poems. The passion and intensity of Dafydd ap Gwilym and Llywelyn Goch ap Meurig Hen tended to be lost. ==Bibliography== *Gwaith Dafydd ab Edmwnd (ed. by Thomas Roberts, Bangor, 1914). *Welsh Literature - Chapter 7: Poets of the Gentry *Meic Stephens, The New Companion to the Literature of Wales (University of Wales Press, Cardiff 1998) *Gwyn Williams, The Burning Tree: Poems from the First Thousand Years of Welsh Verse (Faber and Faber, 1956).

The initial intent of the team was to focus on the younger rugby players, so the seniores team commenced two years after the foundation of the team, in 1998. Unione Rugby Capitolina won two U.19 national championships: in the 2002-2003 season, winning against the rivals of Lazio- Primavera Rugby in the final held at Stadio Flaminio; and in the 2007-2008 season, drawing 14-14 with Benetton Treviso and winning 2-1 at the shoot-outs in Fontanafredda (PD). The team also won a U.17 national championship in 2006-2007 in an intense final played against Petrarca Padova. In 2011 the Club won the fourth national championship, this time in the U.16 category, beating Rugby Rovigo. 1998 is the year in which the Club moves to its own establishment in Via Flaminia and inaugurates the seniores team, mainly composed of friends and newcomers. Capitolina, captained by Stefano Montalto and coached by Luca Santaroni, starts from the serie C2 and manages to immediately obtain the promotion to serie C1, beating all the teams in their league. The year after another coach joins Santaroni: Marco Iscaro, and together the two coaches manage to bring the team to the serie B, after solely two years from the team's existence. In the 2005/6 season Capitolina was promoted to Italy's highest rugby league, the Super 10, with a perfect winning record of 22 wins and a total of 110 points. They won the playoffs against city rivals Rugby Roma with a 20-9 victory to reach the top Italian rugby league after only ten years of existence. Capitolina had been striving to deliver better results both in the national league and in the various European trophies that were available. Although with limited success, key investments in infrastructure and players started to have an impact. At the end of the 2008/2009 season the Board decided not to proceed with the existing formula of \\"professional\\" rugby and withdrew the First XV from the top Italian Championship, thus granting a place in the Super 10 to L'Aquila Rugby.

They won five consecutive regular season titles from 1946–1950 and dominated in attendance as well, drawing over 200,000 fans from 1947–1949.

The Coast Guard's first cutter Resolute was a top-sail schooner built and commissioned in 1867. This first Resolute was homeported in Key West, Florida, and took on the missions of smuggling interdiction as well as search and rescue. The current cutter Resolute is very different in size and construction but the missions remain the same. Resolute is well known for her long and productive history. The sixth of sixteen s, Resolute was the first of her class to be powered by two Alco-B diesel engines. Resolute's keel was laid at the United States Coast Guard Yard, Curtis Bay, Maryland, in May 1965. She was commissioned 8 December 1966. Since that time she has seen several different homeports including San Francisco, California; Alameda, California; Astoria, Oregon; and her current home port of St. Petersburg, Florida. Resolute has been decorated on several occasions. She has done well during Refresher Training (REFTRA), earning eight REFTRA \\"E's\\" for overall excellence in simulated battle and damage scenarios. Resolute has earned two Coast Guard Unit Commendation awards for exceptional work in separate Search and Rescue (SAR) cases. In 1981, Resolute extinguished a fire aboard the tug DeFelice alongside a San Francisco fuel pier. Two Resolute crewmembers entered the burning tug and retrieved her injured occupants. Several of Resolutes crew were injured during this operation while they fought desperately to save the vessel and crew. In 1982, Resolute earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for protecting an from potentially dangerous demonstrators. In 1986, after successfully completing hundreds of SAR cases and fisheries boardings, Resolute saw her first drug bust. The seizure of MV Pamnico and the arrest of the vessel's crew resulted in the interdiction of over of marijuana headed for the streets of the United States. Resolute exercised her multi-mission capabilities during her tour of duty in Astoria, Oregon. On numerous occasions, Resolute was called to assist vessels in distress. Environmental protection was Resolutes primary calling when she was tasked with patrolling US fishery protection zones. Resolute also responded to assist in the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in Alaska. Resolute was decommissioned at the United States Coast Guard Yard in 1994 for a major refurbishment. Following this yard period, she was recommissioned and homeported in St. Petersburg, FL, where she continues to meet diverse challenges off the Southeast United States and in the Caribbean Sea. Resolute escorted the MV Yalta from the Windard Passage to the Port of Tampa, Florida from 27 June – 1 July 2003. Members of Resolutes boarding team and Rescue and Assistance detail were directly responsible for the salvage, safe navigation, operation and security of Yalta, her crew, and over 4 tons of cocaine during the transit. From 5 – 25 July 2003, Resolute participated in TACT (Tailored Annual Cutter Training). The training included such activities as man overboard, anchoring, towing, swept channel, general emergency, collision, gun shoot and general quarters drills.

Today it is part of the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. ==History== Downpatrick was opened in March 1859 by the Belfast and County Down Railway, as the terminus of their line from Queen's Quay station. In 1869 the Downpatrick, Dundrum & Newcastle Railway opened, connecting Newcastle to the BCDR system at Downpatrick. It was worked by the BCDR for its entire independent existence, being absorbed by the BCDR in 1871. Downpatrick became the terminus of yet another line in 1892 following the opening of the Downpatrick, Killough & Ardglass railway, which was built and operated by the BCDR. Coinciding with this, a direct curve from the Belfast line to the Newcastle line was built, and an interchange station (It had no external access) roughly 700m south of Downpatrick was provided at the junction, named Downpatrick Loop Platform. The Loop Platform brought an end to the time-consuming practice of Belfast - Newcastle trains having to enter Downpatrick and run around; instead stopping at the Loop Platform with passengers for Downpatrick catching a connecting train. At its peak, Downpatrick station boasted a turntable, small engine shed, a cattle beach, goods shed and multiple sidings. The station itself was an elaborate affair with a large brick building and an overall glass roof covering the Northern section of the main platform and its associated run- around loop. The bay platform and its loop were covered by a shorter wooden canopy which adjoined the main building. The station and yard were situated on Market Street, roughly where The Grove shopping centre stands today. The station closed completely in 1950, by which time it had been taken over by the Ulster Transport Authority. It was used as a bus station before demolition. ==Today == After a 37-year-long absence, Downpatrick was served by trains once more in 1987. The current railway station is the headquarters of the heritage Downpatrick and County Down Railway. The station yard, which is on a different site to the original BCDR station (Opposite the modern bus station), consists of two locomotive sheds, a carriage workshop, a carriage museum, the station itself, various sidings and other structures. The station building was moved from across the street to its present location in the 1990s. Its previous role was that of the Gas Manager's House. The ground floor hosts the ticket office, shop, model railway room and toilets, the latter two of which are accessed from the platform. The first floor is home to a museum of BCDR railwayana. Downpatrick Station currently only has one operational platform, with a second, slightly shorter one, to be reinstated in the near future. At the north end of the platform, a signal cabin is under construction. At the south end is a water tower. == References == * * * Category:Disused railway stations in County Down Category:Railway stations opened in 1859 Category:Railway stations closed in 1950 Category:1859 establishments in Ireland Category:1950 disestablishments in Northern Ireland ","title":"Downpatrick railway station"},{"id":"7791385","text":"Hindmarch is a surname.

The organisation was registered in Hong Kong in March 1997, and formally established in July 1997. It set up the Loving Heart Clinic (愛心診所) in Wuhan (武漢) as a base. Over the years, it takes the initiative to provide medical and social services for the poor people in China in a human-based approach and at the same time promote Christianity. ==Overview== Acknowledging the insufficient medical and social welfare system in China, especially in villages, Medicare Resources Ltd allocates the donation it receives mostly from US, Canada and Hong Kong, to help a wide range of targets. Its services range from supporting individuals such as injured patients who cannot afford high medical expenses, or sponsoring outstanding students who are financially incapable in receiving university education, to subsidising institutions such as primary and secondary schools where there are serious inadequacy of toilets and sleeping area. To ensure independence from both the church and the PRC government, Medicare Resources Ltd takes on a position as a non-government organisation which is closely connected, but not directly subordinated to church. Mutual trust is often a key for the three parties to co-operate in the actual operation of charity work. ==Mission== The primary mission of Medicare Resources Ltd is to improve the living conditions of the Chinese by providing medical and social services while it also hopes to promote Christianity as well. However, it does not mean that services are exclusive to Christians in China as it also serves non-Christians. Medicare Resources Ltd aims to show its devotion to the underprivileged (even though most of them are not Christians) under the love of god and it is regarded as a means to glorify God. ==Characteristics== Medicare Resources Ltd is a special non-government organisation which is based in Hong Kong but focuses its social service work in China. It has close links with Evangelical Free Church of America but it is independent from the church. Before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, as the issue of intervention of religion from the PRC government in China remained uncertain, Medicare Resources Ltd decided not to be established directly under the church. This independent characteristic enables Medicare Resources Ltd to do charity in a more direct and flexible way in China as it enjoys the advantage of having close connection with Evangelical Free Church of America and at the same time, the free space to self-administer. Medicare Resources Ltd is a world-based non-government organisation. Even though the founder, John Neir, comes from Evangelical Free Church of America, Mediare Resources Ltd is a partner of Hong Kong-based Evangelical Free Church of China and accepts all donations from all around the world. Medicare Resources Ltd was established as a \\"human-based\\" non-government organisation. It does not spend a lot on advertising and promotion; it spends most of its fund in Hubei, China where the service area is. Directors of Medicare Resources Ltd has close relationship with the officials and they benefited by constant visits to Hubei. This is meant for the staff to examine whether the funds are well spent in various projects. Medicare Resources Ltd engages in charity work according to the will of God. It usually does not involve a lot of planning beforehand as it believes that God will plan everything beforehand. One example is the charity done in Fengjie. In 2000, the head of War-planning Bureau of Chongqing, who is interested in Christianity, visited the Evangelical Hospital at Hong Kong and met John Lee, the founder. The head arranged a meeting between Lee and the head of Hygiene Department of the province and they showed interest in co-operation with Medicare Resources Ltd. They gave 3 places for Lee to choose for co-operation and Medicare Resources picked Fengjie because the facilities of Qinglong were too old to improve while the situation of Wanzhou was not as urgent as Fengjie. ==Origin== John Neir, the founder of Medicare Resources Ltd, suffered from a malignant tumor in 1993. After exhausting chemotherapy, Neir left Evangel Hospital of Hong Kong in which he was the former Premier. Neir and his wife, being US missionaries of Evangelical Free Church, have strong collaboration with other missionaries. Mrs Neir got in touch with a missionary whose wife is a Chinese coming from Wuhan. So, Neir reached Pastor Mary Kwok from Wuhan who intended to launch a clinic to serve the medical needs of the poor people. Neir decided to co- operate with Seminary of Central Southern China (中南神學院) which Pastor Kwok is the head so as to help the needy of China. After planning from May 1995 to July 1997, Medicare Resources Ltd registered in Hong Kong as a non-government organisation. It is notable that the inspiration came before the establishment of Medicare Resources Ltd because Neir decided to establish the organisation after contacting Pastor Mary Kwok. ==Service areas== Medicare Resources Ltd focuses its medical and social services mainly in Wuhan (武漢) and Yichang (宜昌) which are located in Hubei (湖北省), and Fengjie (奉節) which is located in Chongqing province (重慶省). ==Achievements== ===Medical=== Wuhan (武漢): * The Loving Heart Clinic (愛心診所) was set up in Wuhan. Yichang (宜昌): * 2 clinics, the Loving Heart Clinic and the Loving Virtue Clinic were set up in Yichang. * A mobile clinic is set up to serve patients in rural area, it is usually free of charge or at a price much lower than market price which is affordable to the poor. * Health Education Classes are held every 2 months in rural area free of charge. Fenjie (奉節): * Cooperate with Fengjie People's Hospital (奉節人民醫院) to provide medical service for the poor and the needy. * Fund the Hospital a Medical Assistance Programme with RMB10,000 per month to support the extremely poor people. ===Student support=== Medicare Resources Ltd engages in direct subsidising high-school and university students with special needs and being a middleman between sponsors and the benefited. ===Economic projects=== Medicare Resources Ltd helps the economically disadvantaged in a sustainable way. Instead of giving them money directly, it hopes to increase their abilities to earn income. So, tea projects and pig projects were carried out since tea is a more value-added good than other agricultural products while piglets are given to the extremely poor peasants (特困戶) for investment. ===Water projects=== Several water projects in both Fengjie and Wufeng had been assisted to provide clean and safe water supply to local schools and community. ===Community development=== A dormitory was built for Kangping School (康坪中小學),a suburb in Fengjie.where students originally had no place to sleep other than on desks or floor at night. Also, funding was provided to Yichang community for road maintenance, especially a RMB 30,000 fund for explosives to clear 400 meters of boulders which blocked a completion of 8 km. ==Future plans== Medicare Resources Ltd is planning to set up a mobile clinic in Hankou (漢口).They will continue school project in Kangping (康坪), and will also expand their service in other parts of China such as Guizhou (貴州). ==References== ==External links== * Medicare Resources Ltd * Evangelical Free Church of America Category:Charities based in Hong Kong Category:Medical and health organisations based in Hong Kong ","title":"Medicare Resources"},{"id":"7791463","text":"Santa Lucía is a city in the province of Corrientes, Argentina.

The Prizma Color system was a color motion picture process, invented in 1913 by William Van Doren Kelley and Charles Raleigh. Initially, it was a two-color additive color system, similar to its predecessor, Kinemacolor. However, Kelley eventually transformed Prizma into a bi-pack color system that itself became the predecessor for future color processes such as Multicolor and Cinecolor. ==Experimental== Prizma gave a demonstration of color motion pictures in 1917 that used an additive four-color process, using a disk of four filters acting on a single strip of panchromatic film in the camera. The colors were red, yellow, green, and blue, with overlapping wavelengths to prevent pulsating effects on the screen with vivid colors. The film was photographed at 26 to 32 frames per second, and projected at 32 frame/s. The disk used in projection consisted mainly of two colors, red-orange and blue- green, adapted to the four-color process by the superimposition of two small magenta filters over one of the red sectors and two similar blue filters over one of the blue-green sectors.Louis Derr, \\"Photography\\", Chemical Abstracts (1917), vol. 11, pp. 1933–1934.\\"The Prizma Film\\", The Edison Monthly (1917), vol. 10, p. 90. Motion Picture News reported, :The results by this process are characterized by extreme delicacy of color, and subdued shades are most admirably rendered.… The blue-green element of the projecting filter appears to favor the blue rather than the green, and as a result, skies and water are well reproduced. We have not noticed anything approaching a true green in any of the subjects so far exhibited, although this is probably by reason of the fact that no prominent greens existed in the subjects photographed. Yellow is not in evidence in the current Prizma films, although a wide variety of warm tones are apparent, ranging from chestnut-brown to a deep red-orange. Colors in full saturation are hardly within the scope of this process.\\"The Prizma Process of Color Photography\\", Motion Picture News (1917), p. 1890. ==Prizma I (additive)== The first commercial system of Prizma was similar to Kinemacolor in that the camera took alternating frames of red-orange and blue-green colors through color filters placed within the camera's shutter. Projection involved running a colored disc again in synchronization with the black and white color record film, and through persistence of vision, the two frames combined on the screen to form a color image. The first film shown in Prizma color was the feature Our Navy at the 44th Street Theatre in New York City on 23 December 1917. General reception to the system was positive, but the rotating filter wheel technique proved impractical. To counteract the issue of having a special projector with a filter wheel, Kelley began tinting alternate frames of his film red and green. However, fringeing, flicker, and light loss were major issues which plagued not only Prizma, but also all of the other additive systems of the Kinemacolor nature. In counteracting this, Kelley had filed a patent in February 1917 which proved to be the foundation of Prizma's second color system. ==Prizma II (subtractive)== On 28 December 1918, Kelley announced that Prizma would release a color film (usually a short) every week, a film which would be projectable on any standard projector. Kelley's idea was two years in the making, but was a valid one which became the springboard for all future color systems to follow — two films were filmed simultaneously with a camera of his own design. One strip was sensitive to red-orange, the other to blue-green (cyan). Both negatives were processed and printed on duplitized film, and then each emulsion was toned its complementary color, red or blue. The final result was a color image that was subtractive in nature — no flicker and a bright projection. But as a result of the way the camera was designed, a constant fringe was apparent, as the strips were being recorded side-by-side. In January 1919, this new process was premiered at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City with the short Everywhere With Prizma. Kelley, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, was a friend of the Rivoli's manager and music director Hugo Riesenfeld and so did business with Samuel Roxy Rothafel's Roxy Theaters chain, which the Rivoli was part of. In February 1921, another Prizma film, Bali, the Unknown was premiered at Roxy's Capitol Theatre in New York. The four-reel feature garnered lukewarm reviews, but enough positive audience response that more films were produced in the system. The Prizma process only took off in 1922, when J. Stuart Blackton of Vitagraph Studios shot his feature film The Glorious Adventure in Prizma. The film, starring Diana Manners and Victor McLaglen, premiered in April 1922 to lukewarm success in the US, but much appeal in the UK. With the prestige of a Vitagraph production, Prizma was considered the apex of color photography at that point in motion picture producers' minds. Prizma sued the Technicolor Corporation in September 1922 on the grounds that Technicolor was infringing upon Prizma's patents. However, Prizma eventually lost the case. In April 1923, Robert Flaherty took both a black-and-white camera and a Prizma color camera to Samoa, hoping to film part of his documentary film Moana (1925) in that process, but the Prizma camera malfunctioned and no color footage was shot. (Moana became famous as the second feature film shot using panchromatic black- and-white film rather than orthochromatic.) ==Work in 3D film== With Harry K. Fairall and Robert F. Elder's 3D feature, The Power of Love, opening 27 September 1922 in Los Angeles and the December 1922 unveiling of Laurens Hammond's Teleview system in New York City, Kelley used his Prizma camera for stereoscopic purposes. As his camera took side-by-side pictures, Kelley mounted a set of prisms on his rig, thus expanding his point of convergence, and utilized his red/blue color system to make an anaglyphic print of his product. His final product was the first of Kelley's Plasticon Pictures entitled Movies of the Future, which was premiered at the Rivoli on 24 December 1922. The film consisted largely of shots of New York City, including Times Square, the New York Public Library, and Luna Park. Based on the success of Movies of the Future, Kelley had his chief photographer, William T. Crispinel, shoot another short film entitled Through the Trees — Washington D.C. in the spring of 1923. The film was not shot with the Prizma rig — which was being used by Flaherty in Samoa — but with one designed by Frederic E. Ives, a technician specializing in 3D photography. Although the short was technically shot better, Riesenfeld rejected it because it did not have the 3D gimmicks that the recent films of that nature included. ==Decline== The last few years of Prizma were somewhat fruitful. Samuel Goldwyn produced Vanity Fair (1923) in Prizma, and D. W. Griffith utilized the process in a couple of his films, including a scene in Way Down East (1920). Flames of Passion (1922), directed by Graham Cutts and starring Mae Marsh and C. Aubrey Smith; The Virgin Queen (1923), directed by J. Stuart Blackton; and I Pagliacci (1923), co-starring Lillian Hall-Davis, were all UK productions with one reel filmed in Prizma. One of the last films using Prizma was Venus of the South Seas (1924), starring Annette Kellerman, where Prizma was used for one reel of a 55-minute film. Venus was restored by the Library of Congress in 2004. In 1928, Prizma was bought by Consolidated Film Industries and was reintroduced as Magnacolor (and later Trucolor). Kelley, who held many patents in color photography, sold his patents and equipment to Cinecolor, which benefited from Kelley's advanced printing techniques. Ironically, Cinecolor was co-founded by Kelley's former photographer, William T. Crispinel. ==List of films made in Prizma Color== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Prizma I and II on Timeline of Historical Film Colors, with primary and secondary sources, patents, and photographs of historical film prints. *List of Prizma films at the IMDb (incomplete) * U.S. Patent: Method of Producing Colored Photographic Images, filed 1914.

He studied at the Gymnasium of Tiflis in 1910-1918 and graduated from the Leningrad University in 1925. He studied Iranian philology under Friedman's direction and, as many other young linguists, fell under the influence of the controversial Nicholas Marr, joining Marr's Yaphetic Institute in 1928. After Marr's death, he moved to broad Iranian topics and field work in Ossetia until the end of World War II. In 1945 he moved back to Leningrad where he published his work on the Nart sagas, a dictionary and grammar book of Ossetian. With Joseph Stalin's condemnation of Marr's linguistic theories the Yaphetic Institute was purged, but Abaev was spared. Starting with the 1950s, Abayev became internationally famous as the leading authority on Scythian and Sarmatian linguistics. Assisted by his friend, Georges Dumézil, Abaev demonstrated connections between the Scythian languages and modern Ossetian. He also pointed out some striking similarities between Ossetian and Celtic mythology. In 1960s, he also became known as a determined opponent of structuralism, which he compared to \\"dehumanization\\" of linguistics.http://izvestia-soigsi.ru/ru/archive/210-alpatov His magnum opus, the Etymological Dictionary of Ossetian Language, which is based on the material of 190 languages and dialects,http://www.ng.ru/style/2000-12-27/16_leave.html was published in four volumes between 1959 and 1989 and became known outside the USSR as well.

His damsire, Bahram, won the English Triple Crown in 1935. ==Racing career== Noor raced at ages two to four in England, meeting with modest success, including a third-place finish in Britain's most prestigious race, The Derby. During the 1949 racing season, he won only one minor race, and his owner sold him to the American Charles S. Howard, famous as the owner of the 1938 U.S. Horse of the Year, Seabiscuit. Howard's trainer, Burley E. Parke, brought Noor to Howard's Ridgewood Ranch in Willits, California, where patience and training transformed the temperamental thoroughbred's style of racing to American standards. Noor made the transition from running on resilient English turf courses to the hard dirt surfaces in the U.S and by 1950, he was the dominant older horse in America, setting three world records and three track records while scoring victories over U.S. Triple Crown champion Citation in four out of their five encounters. Famous for his come-from-behind stretch drives, in 1950 Noor finished the season with a record of 7-4-1 from his 12 starts. In his three years racing in England, he had earned less than $40,000 in total but in the U.S. in 1950 alone he earned $346,940. Noor twice defeated Assault, making him the first horse to ever defeat two U.S. Triple Crown champions. In capturing the Hollywood Gold Cup, he also beat 1950 U.S. Horse of the Year Hill Prince as well as 1949 Kentucky Derby winner Ponder. Noor's performance in 1950 earned him U.S. Champion Handicap Male Horse honors. ==Retirement and stud record== At the end of the 1950 racing season, the five-year-old horse was retired to stand at stud at Ridgewood Ranch but after the property was sold by the estate of Charles Howard, Noor was moved to son Lindsay Howard's Binglin Stable in Moorpark, California. Noor was moved again at the age of 19 to Frank Knoop's Loma Rica Ranch in Grass Valley, California. Noor died on November 16, 1974 at the age of 29.

Ray Krebbs is the illegitimate son of Texas oil baron Jock Ewing. He later appeared in the reunion movie Dallas: War of the Ewings (1998) and made guest star appearances in the 2012 continuation of Dallas. ==Background== Ray Krebbs was born on October 19, 1945, in Emporia, Kansas. His alleged father, Amos Krebbs, left his mother, Margaret Hunter Krebbs, and him when Ray was three years old. At age 15, Ray was sent off to Dallas and to the Southfork Ranch with a letter from his recently deceased mother asking Jock Ewing to help Ray out. Ray's mother, a United States Army Air Corps nurse, was a woman with whom Jock had an affair during World War II. At the time when Ray arrived on Southfork, both Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing knew that Ray was the son of the same woman with whom Jock had an affair in Britain during the war, but they did not know at that time that Ray was Jock's son. ==Storylines== ===Original series=== Ray worked for Jock maintaining Southfork as its ranch foreman. Initially, Ray was a bit of a rogue, dating the much younger Lucy Ewing on the sly, and collaborating with J.R. Ewing to break up J.R's younger brother Bobby and his new wife (and Ray's old flame) Pamela Barnes. Despite this, Ray had a good heart, and became a trusted and upstanding friend of the Ewing family. Eventually, Amos Krebbs showed up in Dallas in 1980 and revealed that he was not Ray's father, reading out information in Margaret Hunter's diary to Jock Ewing, which revealed that Jock was Ray's father. Jock welcomed Ray into the Ewing family and publicly acknowledged Ray as his son. Because of the incestuous implications, Ray's prior relationship with Lucy was never referenced again. Ray eventually found happiness with politician and the widow of former Texas governor Sam Culver, Donna Culver Krebbs, and they married in 1981, but the marriage began to collapse, and in 1985, they separated. Donna found out she was pregnant and Ray tried to reconcile with her, but she refused. During the \\"Dream Season\\", Ray and Donna adopted a deaf boy named Tony after Donna miscarried their child with Down syndrome; the story line included Ray initially wanting Donna to get an abortion. By 1987, they had divorced and Donna had given birth to a daughter named Margaret Krebbs, named after Ray's deceased mother. In 1988, Ray married Jenna Wade after Jenna had given birth to his half-brother Bobby's son, Lucas. Their marriage and the decision that Ray adopt Lucas caused some acrimony between the once-close Ray and Bobby, but they made amends and resumed their brotherly relationship. Eventually, trouble with Jenna's teenage daughter Charlie caused friction between Ray and Jenna. After sending Charlie to boarding school in Europe, Ray and Jenna decided to move to Switzerland permanently, this also happened because Ray cheated on Jenna with another woman, and the only way she might forgive him was if they move away. Clayton and Miss Ellie Farlow visited them before they also left Dallas, tiring of the constant battles within the family. In 1991, Ray returned for the final episode \\"Conundrum\\", and in J.R.'s dream, Ray has a very unhappy working life, having never found out Jock was his father. Ray is also limping heavily due to rodeo injuries (stock footage is shown of Ray in the rodeo won by Dusty Farlow in season three). Seeing Ray working to make ends meet on a ranch and also in a bar (where he is treated poorly), J.R. admits, \\"I kinda feel sorry for him.\\" Later in the dream, it is Ray's birthday, and despite having a poor work life, Ray has a very happy family life and even has a son named Jock. J.R. seems genuinely happy for him, bearing in mind this is a dream. Ray also appeared sporting a mustache, something he never had during his actual time on Dallas. ===Reunion film=== In 1998, Ray (with dyed brown hair) makes a shock return in Dallas: War of the Ewings when he helps Bobby and Sue Ellen in a barroom brawl. It is later revealed Ray is broke as the Krebbs ranch was remortgaged several times (how Ray owned the ranch again is unknown, as it was last seen owned by Michelle Stevens in 1991). Bobby helps him out until J.R. unwittingly helps Ray pocket $50 million for the land, which was auctioned to J.R.'s bitter rival Carter McKay. The land was valued at only $10 million, but happened to be a source of crude oil, which started a bidding war between J.R. and McKay. McKay's bid won the auction, but J.R. later revealed that in Jock's will, the mineral rights were deeded to the Ewings' trust, thereby making the oil inaccessible to Carter McKay. ===2012 revival=== Ray appeared as a guest star in the continuation of Dallas. In 2012, Ray attended his nephew Christopher's wedding to Rebecca Sutter (or Pamela Rebecca Barnes) and later appeared at Bobby's final Southfork barbecue. In 2013, Ray attended J.R.'s funeral at Southfork, where he said that he could never make Jock proud the way J.R. did. Ray was not mentioned in J.R.'s will. In 2014, Ray appeared again at Southfork to attend the wedding of his nephew John Ross to Pamela Rebecca Barnes. Since Ray's return to Dallas, no mention was made of Jenna, his daughter Margaret, stepdaughter Charlie, or adopted son Lucas. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *Ray Krebbs Biography at Ultimate Dallas.com Krebbs, Ray Krebbs, Ray Krebbs, Ray Krebbs, Ray ","title":"Ray Krebbs"},{"id":"7791657","text":"The Tithe Barn is a 14th-century tithe barn in Dunster, Somerset, England.

The overseas rights to the brand, excluding the U.K., were acquired by British American Tobacco (BAT) in 1925.The stories behind the brand names - ARDATH and STATE EXPRESS, Year unknown, BAT It was sold widely throughout the world.Was sold in Belgium, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mauritius, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Today, the brand is still very popular in Asia, especially in the Greater China area, Vietnam, and Cambodia. In the United Kingdom, they are registered and manufactured in Westminster, City of Westminster, London. ==History== ===Origins=== The idea for the State Express brand came from the United States in 1893. Sir Albert Levy (1864–1937), a London tobacco merchant and businessman, was visiting the United States. While in Manhattan, Levy was a passenger on the Empire State Express train, which allegedly broke land speed records as locomotive No.999, the \\"Queen of Speed\\" sped its way from New York City to London. Old tin of State Express 555 State Express was founded in London on 10 March 1896.The State Express Story, BAT Outlook, Issue 16, 1992 The numerals (a series of triple numbers from 111 to 999) forming the other part of the trademark were registered under UK Registration No. 290529 on 18 February 1907. All of these numbers were used as different brands, each with a different blend or mix of tobacco: 444 was made with Macedonian leaf, and 777 was made with Turkish tobacco, for example. The numeric ranges for State Express cigarettes were not the only available variants in the market at that time. Other mark names included My Darling and Astorias, available in export catalogues. In addition to the cigarette business, cigars and tobaccos were available in the State Express range. But by far the most successful of these was the Virginia tobacco blend of State Express 555, introduced in 1896. It went on to become Ardath's flagship brand. A poster shows Ardarth Tobacco offices and factories in 1914 The brand was originally owned by Ardath Tobacco Company. The company was created in the late 19th century in London, England, and was originally called Albert Levy & Thomas.Article on The History of STATE EXPRESS 555, written for TMOA centenary 1986 The Ardath Tobacco Company Limited was originally located at 62 Leadenhall Street in London and called La Casa de Habana (The House of Havana) until 1895, when it changed its name to the present day version. It is said that Sir Albert Levy derived the name Ardath from a book of the same name written by Marie Corelli. The title of the book is derived from numerous references in the Books of Esdras (in the Apocrypha) to the \\"Field of Ardath\\". For example, in the fourth book, chapter IX, verse XXVI reads: 'So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as He commanded me, and there I sat among the flowers and did eat of the herbs of the field and the meat of the same satisfied me' On 31 July 1895 Levy registered the trademark Ardath in Ireland. The name of the company was changed in 1901 to the \\"Ardath Tobacco Company\\", and was split in 1925 when it was sold; British American Tobacco acquired the overseas rights of Ardath, while the Imperial Tobacco Group retained the rights of sale within the United Kingdom and Ireland. The State Express brand proved to be a boon for B.A.T., where it was a huge success in China until the rise of communism there (though it has since been re-introduced). Ardath's brands continued to be sold in Britain; they were granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1946 and again later by Queen Elizabeth II.The State Express Story, BAT Outlook, Issue 16, 1992, In 1961, British American Tobacco bought out Imperial Tobacco's share of Ardath, thus gaining full control of Ardath's trademarks. === War times === In the World War II Ardath supplied 555 cigarettes to General Montgomery's 8th Army. Montgomery organized their distribution and sent a personal letter of appreciation. In the 1920s and 1930s BAT held a dominant position in the Chinese market with State Express 555 playing a key role. Sales of the brand exceeded 5 billion units in 1937. According to Mao Tse Tung’s personal physician, 555 was the Chinese leader’s favorite cigarette. 555 STATE EXPRESS of London, Marketing Brand Manual, Issue 01/93 ==Sport sponsorship== ===Rallying and Formula One=== 555 sponsors motorsports. 555 World Racing logos were seen on Hong Kong – Beijing Rally cars from 1985 to 1987 and Subaru World Rally Championship cars from 1993 to 2004. (the actual 555 brand placement became less frequent in the 21st century, being dropped in 2005). Subaru continued to use 555's blue and yellow colour scheme as its WRC livery until its withdrawal, but with the manufacturer's own logos in place of the 555 brand. For rallies where tobacco advertising was forbidden, the 555 logos were replaced by three crescent moons. British American Racing in 1999 originally wanted to brand Ricardo Zonta's car in the blue & yellow livery of 555 World Racing, whilst branding Jacques Villeneuve's car with Lucky Strike colours. However, the move was blocked by the FIA, and they were forced to run two similar liveries. They opted to have the Lucky Strike brand on the left of the car and 555 World Racing on the right, with a zip going along the middle of the nose. It was highly unpopular, and so for the 2000 season, they chose to just display mostly Lucky Strike logos, with small 555 World Racing logos on the side and nose. Some years between 2000 and 2006 (After Honda had bought out BAR, and were under pressure to drop tobacco sponsorship under new EU legislation), they prominently displayed the 555 World Racing brand at the Chinese Grands Prix, where the 555 brand is better known. However, from 2007 until their withdrawal at the end of 2008, Honda adopted a livery with no sponsorship logos at all, but a livery depicted Earth to raise environmental awareness. In countries where tobacco sponsoring was banned, the 555 logos were replaced by three crescent moons. ===Other sponsorships=== * In 1979 and 1982, 555 sponsored Badminton. * In 1980, 555 sponsored 1980 Summer Olympics. * The 1984 Challenge Cup was named the State Express Challenge Cup due to sponsorship from State Express. * In 1992, 555 (with Bentoel Group and Rothmans Group) sponsored the 1992 World Rally Championship season. * In 1996 Star Trek: The Next Generation on Myanmar TV was sponsored by 555. ==Markets== State Express 555 is or was sold in the following countries: Bangladesh, United States, Antigua, Barbados, Grenada, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Cyprus, Belarus, Russia, Malaysia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Mauritius, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and New Zealand. ==In popular culture== The brand is cited in Salman Rushdie's post-colonial novel Midnight's Children, where it is, mis-attributed to the former British importer and manufacturer W.D. & H.O.

The Market Street Gang was made up of pickpockets, sneak thieves and labor sluggers working in the 42nd and 43rd Wards. The gang especially distinguished itself during the newspaper \\"Circulation Wars\\" of the early 1910s between the Chicago Examiner and the Chicago Tribune. It was during the Circulation Wars that future North Side leader Dean O'Banion, then a member of the juvenile satellite Little Hellions, would develop valuable contacts with politicians and journalists. O'Banion and other members of the North Siders would be mentored by safecracker Charlie \\"The Ox\\" Reiser. O'Banion was one of the many Market Streeters to become a bootlegger. ===Prohibition=== With the start of Prohibition, the North Siders quickly took control of the existing breweries and distilleries in the North Side of Chicago. This gave them a near monopoly on the local supply of real beer and high quality whiskey; their rivals only had supplies of rotgut liquor and moonshine. Based on the North Clark Street restaurant McGovern's Saloon and Cafe, the North Side Gang would soon control the working-class neighborhoods of the 42nd and 43rd Wards within months. In addition to bootlegging, the gang continued to burglarize local stores and warehouses and run illegal gambling operations. Unlike the rival South Side Gang, however, they refused to traffic in prostitution. O'Banion strengthened his political protection by helping his politician friends commit election fraud. O'Banion also ran a publicity campaign in the North Side with large-scale donations to orphanages and charities as well as food and loans to the poor and unemployed. The old hostility between Irish and Italian gangs, combined with O'Banion's refusal to sell portions of North Side distilleries to the South Siders, raised tension between the North and South Siders. During several meetings arranged by Torrio, O'Banion would often insult the Italians. O'Banion was also secretly hijacking South Side beer shipments and selling them back to their owners. However, the North Side Gang also ran into trouble with other ethnic gangs; in 1921, O'Banion shot Ragen's Colts member Davy \\"Yiddles\\" Miller after he insulted a North Sider at a local opera. Although O'Banion and Weiss were arrested and charged with burglary in 1922, the North Side Gang enjoyed considerable protection from the Chicago police department. At one point, O'Banion threw a lavish banquet for Chicago politicians and police officials. Attendees included Chief Detective Michael Hughes, Police Lieutenant Charles Evans, County Clerk Robert Sweitzer, Public Works commissioner Colonel Albert A. Sprague, and a host of both Democratic and Republican politicians. Dubbed the \\"Balshazzar Feast\\" by the press, it was later investigated by reform Mayor William E. Dever. In 1924, Chicago police assisted the North Side Gang in robbing the Sibly Distillery, which had been under federal guard since the beginning of Prohibition. Escorted by Police Lieutenant Michael Grady and four detective sergeants, North Siders looted the distillery in broad daylight, taking 1,750 barrels of bonded whiskey worth approximately $100,000. Although Grady and the other police officers were later indicted for this crime, they were quickly dismissed. Relations between the North and South Side gangs continued to fester. In early 1924, O'Banion agreed to an alliance with Torrio and Capone that was brokered by Mike Merlo. However, the alliance began to founder when O'Banion demanded that \\"Bloody\\" Angelo Genna pay a $30,000 gambling debt from losses at the co-owned gambling casino The Ship. This demand contravened an agreement allowing Angelo and other gang members to run up debts there. In the interest of maintaining harmony, Torrio persuaded Genna to pay his gambling debt. However, Torrio himself would lose patience with O'Banion when O'Banion offered to sell Torrio the valuable Sieben Brewery. On May 19, 1924, while Torrio was inspecting the property, O'Banion arranged for the police to raid the place and arrest Torrio. After his release from custody, Torrio acceded to demands from the Gennas to kill O'Banion. On November 10, shortly after the death of Merlo, three unidentified men entered the Schofield Flower Shop owned by O'Banion and shot him dead. This was to be the beginning of a five-year gang war between the North Side Gang against Johnny Torrio's Chicago Outfit that would climax with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929. ===War with the Chicago Outfit=== After the death of Dean O'Banion, Hymie Weiss assumed leadership of the North Side Gang and immediately struck back at his rivals. On January 12, 1925, Weiss, Bugs Moran, and Vincent Drucci attempted to kill Torrio's lieutenant, Al Capone at a Chicago South Side restaurant. Firing at Capone's car, the men wounded chauffeur Sylvester Barton, but missed Capone entirely. Capone, unnerved by the shooting, ordered his famous armoured car to be created. Moran then decided to kidnap one of Capone's trusted bodyguards, torturing him for information before finally executing him and dumping the body. On January 24, shortly after the assassination attempt on Capone had taken place, Weiss, Moran, and Drucci ambushed Torrio as he returned from shopping with his wife. Both Torrio and his chauffeur Robert Barton were wounded several times. As Moran was about to kill Torrio, the gun misfired; the gang members were forced to flee the scene as the police arrived. After narrowly surviving this attack, Torrio decided he wanted out. After serving time on bootlegging charges Torrio retired to Italy, passing leadership of the Chicago Outfit to Capone. Weiss and the North Siders then went after the Genna Family, allies of the Chicago Outfit. First, \\"Bloody\\" Angelo Genna was shot to death by Moran after a car chase. Next, Mike \\"The Devil\\" Genna was shot down by police when he turned his gun on them after a fierce shootout with the Northsiders. Then Drucci killed Samuzzo \\"Samoots\\" Amatuna, a Genna family backer trying to hold the Gennas intact. Finally Anthony Genna was murdered (although it was rumored that Capone, not Weiss, ordered this). At this point, the remaining Genna family fled Chicago. The North Siders and Capone took the spoils. ===The Northsiders under Weiss, Drucci and Moran=== Soon after Dean O'Banion's death, the North Siders had formed a \\"governing council\\" with Hymie Weiss emerging as leader. Although the loss of O'Banion was a shock to them, the gang was at the height of its power. The Genna family was gone, Torrio had been scared out of the rackets, and Capone was on the defensive. The North Siders expanded their business and strength and plotted another attack on Capone. In the second North Side attack on Capone, a fleet of North Side cars, with Moran in the lead car, drove to Capone's hotel in Cicero. While Capone and his bodyguard were drinking downstairs, the North Siders drove by the lobby and opened fire with their Thompson submachine guns. Capone and his bodyguard were forced to take cover on the floor. Once the attack was over, Capone sent word to the North Siders that he wanted a truce. A truce was made, which inevitably began to come apart. Some time later, Capone struck back at the North Siders by gunning down Hymie Weiss and several associates. Drucci and Moran now assumed joint leadership of the North Side Gang. The two gangs traded killings and bombings for several more months until a peace conference was held. Moran and Capone both appeared at the meeting along with many other mob bosses. During the conference, Capone complained that \\"they were making a shooting gallery of a great business\\". He also stated that \\"Chicago should be seen as a pie and each gang gets a slice of the pie.\\" The two gangs agreed to make peace. This peace would last for a while, during which no killings occurred as a result of gang war. Vincent Drucci was killed during this time, but it resulted from a brawl with police. Moran now became the sole boss of the North Side Gang. However, conflict eventually started again. Moran would regularly hijack Capone's beer shipments, aggravating Capone. Capone retaliated by burning down Moran's dog track. A few days later, Capone's own dog track went up in smoke. Moran was the prime suspect. Open warfare started again between the two gangs. Moran ordered the execution of two union leaders who were powerful allies and personal friends of Capone. This act prompted Capone to order the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. ===St. Valentine's Day Massacre=== On February 14, 1929, four unidentified men, two of them dressed as Chicago police officers, entered a North Side Street garage and ordered six members of the North Side Gang and a friend of a gang member to stand against a wall. The gunmen then pulled out machine guns and gunned them all down. The only survivor, Frank \\"Tight Lips\\" Gusenberg, died hours later at a nearby Chicago hospital refusing to name his attackers. However, the primary target of the gunmen, Bugs Moran, leader of the North Side Gang, was not at the garage and escaped harm. Strong circumstantial cases can be made for almost a dozen individuals as being one of the gunmen, but it remains unknown to this day exactly who those four gunmen were. Known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the attack effectively left the five-year gang war between Al Capone and Bugs Moran in a stalemate. The brazenness of this crime resulted in a Federal crackdown on all gang activity in Chicago that eventually led to the downfall of both Moran and Capone. ===Aftermath=== Although Bugs Moran survived the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, several experienced North Side gunmen had been lost. The North Side Gang continued to control the 42nd and 43rd Wards and managed to thwart a takeover attempt by Frank McErlane in 1930. As the decade progressed, the power of the North Side Gang slowly declined. In 1936, Jack \\"Machine Gun\\" McGurn, mastermind of the massacre, was killed and Moran was one of the prime suspects, along with Frank Nitti of the South Side mob, as McGurn had become more trouble than he was worth to protect to the former \\"Capone Gang\\". Moran and the North Side Gang eventually lost control of their gambling operations to the new National Crime Syndicate. Since the repeal of Prohibition, gambling had been the main source of North Side income. Bugs Moran eventually left the gang by 1935, after which it quickly dissolved. == North Side Gang members == ===Bosses=== *1919-1924 -- Dean O'Banion (1892-1924) *1924-1926 -- Hymie Weiss (1898 -1926) *1926-1927 -- Vincent \\"The Schemer\\" Drucci (1898-1927) *1927-1935 -- George \\"Bugs\\" Moran (1891-1957) ===Other members=== { class=\\"sortable \\" ! width=\\"21%\\" Name ! width=\\"7%\\" Portrait ! width=\\"9%\\" Life ! width=\\"55%\\" Comments - valign=\\"top\\" Jack \\"Two Gun\\" Alterie 50px 1886-1935 A leading gunman during Chicago's bootleg wars, Louis Alterie was one of the more colorful figures in the Northsiders.

May was an occasional strongarm for the Moran gang (though it is believed he never carried a gun) but was, most frequently, simply a car mechanic working on a per diem basis.

Written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong, the episode was first broadcast on the digital channel BBC Three on 5 November 2006, and later repeated on terrestrial channel BBC Two on 8 November. In the episode, Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), a half-converted Cyberman, attacks the base of the alien hunters Torchwood after secretly being housed there by her boyfriend Ianto Jones to make her fully human again. The episode was among the first pitched for the series, as creator Russell T Davies saw a potential to continue the story from the Doctor Who episodes \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\". Chibnall originally intended the episode to appear sometime midway through the series, but was ultimately brought forward to the fourth slot. It was filmed in the third production block. Because of the limited number of filming locations and cast members, it was among the cheapest episodes in the first series. It was seen by almost 1.4 million viewers after its original broadcast and received generally mixed reactions from critics, though the producers regard the episode as one of their favourites in the series. ==Plot== In Cardiff, the Torchwood team, sans Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), who remains behind, go out for a drink. Alone in the hub, Ianto brings in Japanese cybernetics expert Dr Tanizaki (Togo Igawa) down to a basement deep inside, home to Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), Ianto's girlfriend. Ianto and Lisa both worked Torchwood in London when Cybermen partially converted Lisa before their invasion ended. Ianto has since cared for her by placing her in the basement with a conversion unit to keep her alive. Ianto wants Tanizaki to reverse the process. Tanizaki is able to make her breathe on her own again, but by that time, the team is recalled back to deal with a rogue UFO. When Tanizaki brings Lisa back down to the basement, her Cyberman influence takes over and she kills him by attempting to \\"upgrade\\" him. This causes a power flicker in the Hub; Ianto makes an excuse to look into it himself and finds Tanizaki's body. As he leaves Lisa to hide the body, she drains even more power by re-entering the conversion unit. Believing the Hub is under attack, team leader Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to the basement where they find the abandoned conversion unit. Jack runs down to find Owen missing and Gwen about to be converted. He stops the process and attempts to shoot Lisa, but Ianto stops him, allowing Lisa to escape. Ianto pleads with Jack that they try to save her, but Jack affirms that there is no cure. Ianto approaches Lisa to reason with her, only to end up being knocked unconscious. Jack buys technical expert Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) time to go to the surface to recharge the emergency power cells by allowing himself to be \\"deleted\\" (death from electrocution by a Cyberman's touch) twice by Lisa, though he would survive due to his immortality. To allow the rest of the team to escape, Jack sprays Lisa with a special \\"barbecue sauce\\" that summons the pet pterodactyl; as it attacks her, the team escapes by the invisible lift. Ianto punches Jack for his actions, uttering he is \\"the biggest monster of them all.\\" Meanwhile, a pizza delivery girl (Bethan Walker) unwittingly enters the Hub to find a seriously injured Lisa. Ianto runs back to the Hub, but is stopped by Jack, who threatens him at gunpoint with an ultimatum; either he will execute Lisa, or if he does not do so in ten minutes, Jack will enter and kill them both. Toshiko reaches the surface where she finds Owen, all tied up and gagged. While she frees him, Ianto returns to the basement and is devastated to find Lisa dead. He then sees the delivery girl, who has a large cut across her forehead; Lisa implanted her brain into the delivery girl. At first reluctant, Ianto aims his gun at her, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. The girl tries to explain she did this for Ianto, but then promises that they can be upgraded together. The rest of the Torchwood team, arriving to hear that, open fire and kill her, leaving Ianto to mourn. ==Production== ===Background=== \\"Cyberwoman\\" was the first episode to centre on Ianto Jones, portrayed by Gareth David-Lloyd (pictured). The idea behind the episode came from series creator Russell T Davies, who realised there was a story \\"begging to be told\\" after the Doctor Who episodes \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\"; in the episodes, Cybermen from a parallel universe invade Earth to assimilate the human population. They were ultimately defeated when the Doctor (David Tennant) banishes them to the void, a space between universes, to be imprisoned. \\"Cyberwoman\\" was among the first episodes pitched for the first series. When Chris Chibnall was appointed head writer for Torchwood, Davies asked him to write an episode about a cyber girl in the basement of the Hub. Out of the entire first series, \\"Cyberwoman\\" is the biggest nod to Doctor Who, there was little to no mention of the series, despite being a spin-off, which was made deliberate to send out \\"confusing signals\\" to the audience about what the series is. Chibnall wanted to include a base description of what a Cyberman is for any viewer who had not seen Doctor Who. The episode was the first to centre on Ianto, who in the first three episodes was more or less a background character, and what John Barrowman described as like Torchwoods version of Alfred Pennyworth in Batman. Chibnall originally intended for the episode to become the sixth or seventh in the series, but was brought forward to the fourth because some of the other scripts were not yet completed. It also became one of Chibnall's harder episodes to write. Before settling on the current title, Chibnall went through numerous working titles, including \\"The Trouble with Lisa\\" and \\"The Long Night of Ianto\\". \\"Cyberwoman\\" was ultimately chosen because the title \\"says it all.\\" ===Writing=== In writing the beginning, Chibnall envisaged Ianto meeting Tanizaki at an airport and then escorting him to a hotel before entering the Hub, however that was cut from the final draft as it would be an expensive sequence to film. Chibnall wanted the episode to take place several weeks after the previous episode, \\"Ghost Machine\\", as to show Gwen knowing all the protocols and how to handle weapons, where as in the last episode, Gwen was still considered a rookie. Despite the episode being about stopping Lisa, Chibnall still wanted the beginning to be a love story between her and Ianto, and show the audience that a half-converted Lisa is still human and the girlfriend Ianto loves. Also, because Ianto is \\"fundamentally wrong\\" about thinking Lisa can be saved, Chibnall wanted the audience to sympathise with the character and his motives. The idea of having Lisa fight the pterodactyl, named Myfanwy by the producers, made them laugh, and felt they had to include it. The line where Ianto calls Jack the \\"biggest monster\\" was intended to be cut out, but Chibnall decided to keep it because of its impact to the audience. The scene where the team lines up to execute Lisa towards the end was the first scene Chibnall had in mind for the episode, though in the first draft, it was Ianto who killed her. After the episode was written and filmed, Chibnall discovered two main plot holes in the story. The first is that he did not make clear that everything about Lisa, including the scene where she acted human was all part of her plan for her Cyberman- influence to take over, and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly. The second was Jack having a cut lip in the end, even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly. In the audio commentary for the episode, both Chibnall and actor Gareth David- Lloyd stated the reasoning behind the cut being there is because Jack's immortal powers would only deal with life-threatening wounds and not minor injuries. ===Filming=== The basement where Ianto held Lisa was filmed at a cellar in Tredegar House. Before filming took place, David-Lloyd met with Caroline Chikezie and got to know each other to help give their respective characters their chemistry. The episode was filmed as part of the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real time format. Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a \\"secret agent.\\" Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each hand like professionals. The external shots of the Hub were filmed at Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff, which is what exists above the Hub in the series. Filming the scenes at the Plass took place during the middle of the night, and was disrupted by hooligans. The basement where Ianto holds Lisa was filmed at a cellar in Tredegar House, Newport. The original ending to the episode is where Toshiko hands Ianto coffee while he is cleaning the Hub. However, after it was filmed, Strong decided to cut that scene out, as he felt the overhead shot of the Hub before that scene would have made a more suitable ending. Because it was filmed in only a handful of locations, mostly in the Hub set, and there were only a few guest cast members, \\"Cyberwoman\\" was considered one of the cheapest episodes in the first series. ===Costume and effects=== The producers noted there were a history of \\"sexy, pneumatic, hydraulic women\\" in science fiction, and wanted to \\"tap into that.\\" To make the cyberwoman costume, the props department wanted to make it as \\"sexy\\" as they can. Director James Strong wanted to make the costume look \\"amazing,\\" but threatening and scary as well. There were discussions about which parts of Lisa would be human, and which parts would be cyborg. Made out of rubber, it was custom made to fit Chikezie as much as possible. It took an entire day for the actress to get her body cast. After the costume was completed, it would take an hour to apply each morning, and an hour to remove by lunch break. Chikezie found it difficult to hear anything from the helmet while shooting scenes. It was also uncomfortable for her, but the producers noted she remained stoic throughout filming. The fight scene between Lisa and Myfanwy was difficult to shoot, as the actress had to interact with a visual effect creature that would not be added until post- production. The producers added a plastic green beak stuck on the end of a stick to be used as a guide. The scene where the team go up on the invisible lift was made by making the platform stationary, but the camera below it would descend, giving the illusion the platform is ascending. The visual effect of the tools used to create Cybermen were reused from the Doctor Who episode \\"The Age of Steel\\", while the UFO footage when the Torchwood team return from the drinks was a tin foil-covered frisbee on a fishing line. ==Broadcast, reception and analysis== ===Ratings and critical reception=== \\"Cyberwoman\\" was first broadcast on BBC Three during the 10 pm time slot on Sunday 5 November 2006. The episode was seen by 1.391 million viewers, the highest viewing on the channel the week it was broadcast. The repeat on terrestrial channel BBC Two on 8 November 2010, was seen by 2.1 million viewers with a 10% audience share. It was given an Appreciation Index of 84. Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek reacted positively towards the episode, stating \\"surprisingly, it was absolutely brilliant – a mini-tragedy of sorts about secrets, obsession and corruption that finally gave both Gareth David-Lloyd something interesting to do and the series some much-needed focus. Plus, they totally played a Mogwai song! How often does that happen on television?\\" Montesinos-Donaghy felt it was \\"a step in the right direction,\\" adding that it has \\"everything I could have wanted from a Torchwood episode.\\" Ian Hyland of News of the World disliked the episode, stating \\"After this week's 'Cyberwoman' nonsense, 'Torch Script' would be a better idea.\\" Androzani.com said of the episode, \\"It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks,\\" adding \\"the single nice thing we can find to say is that the concept had potential.\\" Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, \\"despite a strong - and somewhat morally ambiguous - ending [the episode] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this.\\" Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating \\"we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder.\\" Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series. ===Critical analysis=== In an essay on evolving symbolism with the Cybermen, Lincoln Geraghty of the University of Portsmouth argues that in \\"Cyberwoman\\", \\"we see the first female Cyber character on screen; unable to control her programming she attempts to assimilate her ex-boyfriend and his teammates. Like Maria in Metropolis and the suburban threat seen in The Stepford Wives (1975), technology is seen here as even more threatening when linked with the possibility of female reproduction.\\" Neil Perryman of the University of Sunderland feels this episode is a prime example of transmedia storytelling in Doctor Who and Torchwood, describing the episode and ancillary online material released after its airing being in part an attempt at continuity management. He describes \\"...these metasites have also been used to correct continuity errors that have appeared within the television show. For example, following the broadcast of the Torchwood episode ‘Cyberwoman’ (13 November 2006), the official Torchwood website provided information about ‘The Fall of Torchwood One’ that attempted to correct – via ‘additive comprehension’ – what some fans had regarded as a glaring error in the plot. Fans had asked how the eponymous Cyberwoman was not sucked into the void along with the rest of her kin during the climax to the Doctor Who episode ‘Doomsday’ (8 July 2006) and the site retroactively explained away the problem: ‘The only exceptions were those being converted with material entirely derived from this side of the void’, which allowed the events of ‘Cyberwoman’ to take place without contradicting what viewers originally saw in the episode.\\" ==References== ==External links== * \\"Cyberwoman\\" episode guide entry on the BBC website Category:Torchwood episodes Category:Cybermen television stories Category:2006 British television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Chris Chibnall ","title":"Cyberwoman"},{"id":"7791803","text":"Donna Culver Krebbs is a fictional character in the popular American television series Dallas, played by Susan Howard from 1979 to 1987.\\"Whatever happened to; PETROCELLI 1978-79.(Features).\\" Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland). MGN Ltd. 1999. Retrieved August 14, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60427577.html ==Casting and creation== Susan Howard was cast in the series in 1979. For the second and third seasons, she appeared in a recurring capacity; during the fourth season, she became a regular cast member. In 1986, Howard won Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Actress in a Supporting Role on a Primetime Serial for role. In 1987, the show's producers opted not to renew her contract, stating that her character had run its course. Howard has claimed this decision was connected to her opposition of what she saw as pro-abortion storylines involving her character. ==Storylines== Donna was an intelligent, ambitious and well- regarded politician's wife, married to much older Sam Culver, a former governor of Texas and Speaker of the House who is an old friend and former business partner of Jock Ewing. Sam Culver is most likely based on longtime Texas Congressman and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn. During her marriage, she began an affair with Ray Krebbs, foreman of Southfork Ranch. However, despite finding love with Ray, Donna decided to remain with Sam because he was dying. After Sam's death, Donna and Ray attempted a reconciliation but she rebuffed his proposal of marriage because she felt it was too soon after Sam's death. Donna then briefly got romantically involved with Cliff Barnes, but their relationship dissolved when Donna backed Bobby Ewing as a replacement for her stepson Dave Culver in the state senate instead of Cliff. Donna then married Ray in 1981 and they lived in a house that Ray built on the outskirts of Southfork Ranch. Since Ray had found out he was Jock Ewing's son, he acted as though he wasn't good enough for Donna, comparing himself to her and Jock's other sons, especially after he made failed attempts to compete in business by working on development projects with Jock and Punk Anderson. After Jock died in a helicopter crash in South America, Ray fell into a deep depression: drinking, neglecting his duties at Southfork, and having an affair with an old girlfriend named Bonnie. However, he and Donna remained married and stuck by each other. While researching her new book on Sam Culver's early years in politics, Donna discovers that Sam and Jock had put Sam's uncle, Jonas Culver, in a mental institution in order to get his land and drill the oil on it, which was the start of the Culver and Ewing family fortunes. Jonas committed suicide shortly after institutionalized. In the 1984-85 season, Donna and Ray decided to separate due to her emphasis on her new career in the oil industry, but Donna discovered she was pregnant with Ray's child. In the 1985-86 season, Donna and Ray discovered their unborn child had Down syndrome and, despite Ray's efforts for an abortion, Donna decided to keep the child. At a rodeo, she was injured by a bull, causing her to miscarry. She and Ray then adopted a deaf boy named Tony in 1986. However, when star Patrick Duffy decided to return to the show — despite his character Bobby having died a season earlier — the entire 1985-86 season was relegated to a dream. As a result, in the following season, Donna was still pregnant, having never miscarried. This time, she decided to divorce Ray. Donna moved to Washington, D.C., and became a lobbyist for the oil industry. During this time she met Sen. Andrew Dowling and they started a relationship. She subsequently gave birth to Ray's daughter, Margaret (named after Ray's mother) in 1987, and she and Ray parted ways as friends. ==References== * ==Notes== ==External links== *Donna Culver Krebbs Biography at Ultimate Dallas.com Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1979 Category:Fictional politicians ru:Список актёров и персонажей телесериала «Даллас»#Донна Калвер Креббс ","title":"Donna Culver Krebbs"},{"id":"7791807","text":"J.

It is a combination routine of a radial pull-up followed by a dip. Variations exist for the rings as well as the bar. ==Form== The muscle-up begins with the arms extended above the head, gripping a hold in the overhand pull-up position. The hold is usually on a chin-up bar or gymnastic rings. The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up. When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight. To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated. As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a swinging dead hang (or by standing still, with feet farther forward than the bar, if the person's feet can touch the ground) and uses muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in an explosive yet controlled fashion. ==Grip and wrist position== On the bar, a closed pull-up grip involves the thumb on the opposite side of the bar from the rest of the fingers. When rings are used, an advanced position known as the \\"false grip\\" must be used in order to transition smoothly from the pull-up to the dip. ==Muscles targeted== True to its name, the muscle-up targets a large number of muscle groupings in the back, shoulders, arms, and core. Major pull-up power comes from the latissimus dorsi muscle of the back and the biceps. The entire core is engaged throughout this movement as well in order to stabilize the transition.

It is a Grade I listed building, and is currently in use as a private residence. ==Architecture== The house, built of ironstone, remains broadly as it was originally designed, with nine bedrooms and four major reception rooms across two main floors. The top floor, with servants quarters, is hidden from view by balustrades around the side of the roof, and there is a large basement. The house has a number of unusual features - perhaps the most interesting being that the large portico traditional on such houses is placed at the rear, not the front.

In 1877 he co-founded Barnett Bank, known as \\"Florida's Bank\\", the largest in the U.S. state of Florida at the time of its acquisition by NationsBank in 1997. ==Early years== He was born in Hiawatha, Kansas, the son of William Boyd Barnett and the former Sarah Jane Blue.Miller, Joseph E.: \\"Headstone: William Boyd Barnett (1824–1903)\\" Jacksonville Observer, July 26, 2009 His father was a merchant and a banker in northeast Kansas. He was the younger of two children who lived to adulthood. His older brother Will was five years older than he, and moved from Kansas to Jacksonville, Florida to start a furniture business in 1874, just as Bion enrolled at the University of Kansas. Will spoke highly of Florida's moderate winter, so the following year, his parents journeyed to Jacksonville to visit their oldest son. Sarah Barnett suffered from neuralgia, but her health improved during their time in Florida, so the Barnetts returned to Kansas, liquidated their assets, and relocated to Jacksonville in March 1877. Bion, who was a college senior, withdrew from school to join his parents three months before graduation.Ginzl, David J.: \\"Barnett: The Story of Florida's Bank\\" , University of Tampa Press, 2001 ==Bank of Jacksonville== On May 7, 1877, Barnett opened the Bank of Jacksonville on the corner of Main and Forsyth with $43,000 in capital. William was president, Bion acted as bookkeeper, and one other person was hired as teller/clerk. Most Florida banks at the time were private and unregulated. In spite of being a newcomer and a Yankee, Barnett and the new institution slowly gained the people's trust, but at the end of their first year, and deposits only amounted to $11,000. Undeterred, William invited Bion to be partner.Ginzl, David: \\"The Last Days of Barnett\\", Jacksonville Magazine, October 1998 ===Fate=== A conversation between Bion Barnett and Henry L'Engle changed the bank's fortunes. L'Engle, the Duval County Tax Collector, was annoyed because the bank holding the county's funds charged $6.25 for each transfer to New York City banks. Bion offered to waive the fee if Duval County deposited their funds in the Bank of Jacksonville. L'Engle agreed, and the BoJ began to prosper. Within a year, L'Engle was appointed Treasurer for the State of Florida, and the state's accounts were transferred to BoJ. Within a few years, operating capital exceeded $150,000, and in 1888,\\"BIOGRAPHICAL / HISTORICAL NOTE\\" University of North Florida, Carpenter Library, BARNETT BANKS COLLECTION the Barnetts applied for and received a National Charter, pursuant to the National Bank Act. This allowed them to become the National Bank of Jacksonville. The institution's deposits exceeded $1 million in 1893. Florida's first Burroughs Adding Machine was installed at the bank during this time. ===Experience=== Around 1890, Bion invested $3,000 in a phosphate mining enterprise that promised a return of $100,000 in three months time. When he lost the entire amount, he never again speculated, and applied that same principle at Barnett Bank. He was fond of telling people, \\"It is not the things you don't know that get you in trouble. It is the things you think you know for sure that get you in trouble.\\" On Barnett Banks 50th anniversary in 1927, Bion repeated his father's Five Rules of Business: ===20th century=== The Great Fire of 1901 destroyed most of the city, and the National Bank of Jacksonville was the only bank still standing. When Bion's father died on October 21, 1903, Bion became president and resolved to rename the institution in his father's honor. The bank was rechartered as the Barnett National Bank of Jacksonville in 1908. For their 50th anniversary, the bank built and moved into the 18-story Barnett National Bank Building, the tallest structure in Jacksonville from 1926 to 1954. Bion Barnett commented \\"that the family-owned institution had endured epidemics, fire, freezes, and financial panics\\".Dougal, April S.: \\"Barnett Bank\\" Answers.com ===Depression=== Just two years later, the bank experienced the Great Depression and Barnett tried unsuccessfully to merge with Florida National Bank. Baker, Fentress & Company owned Consolidated Naval Stores in Jacksonville and purchased a sizable quantity of Barnett stock. The infusion of capital left the bank stronger, but ended complete family control of the institution. A bank holding company was begun after the stock market crash in 1929, and Barnett National Securities Corporation purchased and reopened several failed banks. The day before a bank holiday on March 5, 1933, Barnett expected a bank run. To prevent this, Bion directed the bank's personnel to pull all small denomination bills from the vault, and leave the $50s, $100s, $500s and $1,000 bills. Tellers were instructed to slowly count each withdrawal. Those at the end of the line saw their friends and neighbors leave the bank carrying large stacks of bills, which prompted many customers to regain confidence and leave without their money. The bank continued to grow with the acquisition of many more Florida banks over the next two decades. ==Personal== Barnett married Carolina Hallowes L'Engle on April 8, 1880Foley, Bill: \\"Bank rooted in city's past, present\\" Florida Times-Union, September 14, 1997 and the union produced four children: Madeline, William L'Engle, Bion Hall, Jr., and Donald Murray.Florida Historical Society: \\"Barnett, Bion H.\\" Makers of America Volume I, pages 158 - 163 Barnett kept a home in France, and stayed there for extended visits.

Richard Daniel was the son of Dr. Richard Potts Daniel and Isabel Mary Fernandez. ==Public service== Beginning in the late 19th century, Jacksonville's Board of Bond Trustees controlled most government operations, including the municipal electric plant, the city water and sewer departments, the fire and police departments, and hired all city employees except elected officials. Barnett was a member or chairman of the board from October 1896 to March 1911 when he resigned.\\"Trustees of the Board\\" Annual report of the Board of Trustees for the Waterworks and Improvement Bonds of the city of Jacksonville, Florida, 1896 He was a prominent Mason; treasurer of Damascus Commandry, Knights Templar; a member of the Seminole Club, the Florida Yacht Club, the Florida Country Club and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. ==Retirement== Barnett retired from the board of Barnett Bank with 75 years of service in 1952 at the age of 94 and was named honorary chairman.

Bion, their youngest son, was a senior at the University of Kansas and withdrew from school to join his parents.Ginzl, David J.: \\"Barnett: The Story of Florida's Bank\\" , University of Tampa Press, 2001 In the spring of 1877, the United States was in the middle of the Depression of 1873-79, and Jacksonville already had three banks. The city's population was under 10,000 and there was no infrastructure to support a beginning tourism industry. On May 7, 1877, Barnett opened the Bank of Jacksonville (BoJ) on the corner of Main and Forsyth with $43,000 in capital. William was president, Bion acted as bookkeeper, and one other person was hired as teller/clerk. Most Florida banks at the time were private and unregulated. In spite of being a newcomer and a Yankee, Barnett and the new institution slowly gained the people's trust, but at the end of their first year, deposits amounted to only $11,000. Undeterred, William invited his son, Bion Barnett, to be partner and passed along Barnett's five rules of business: #Follow the Golden Rule. You cannot go wrong treating the other man as you would be treated. #Give a man 50 cents if you can make a dollar out of him. In other words, be liberal in your dealings but always have a net profit. Do not do business at a loss. #If a young man is of good habits - honest, capable, saving, giving close attention to his business and making progress but lacking in capital - help him. The young man of today is the businessman of tomorrow. #Never make a promise you cannot and do not fulfill. Investigate carefully before granting a line of credit; once granted, there being no adverse change in your client's financial condition, fulfill your promise. Your word must be as good as your bond. #Watch your expense account and your losses; your profits will take care of themselves. According to Bion Barnett, \\"I have never found a flaw in it. It is good advice today.\\" ===Fate=== A conversation between Bion Barnett and Henry L’Engle changed the bank's fortunes.

This allowed them to become the National Bank of Jacksonville. The institution's deposits exceeded $1 million in 1893. ===20th century=== Barnett National Bank Building in 2011 The Great Fire of 1901 destroyed most of the city, but the National Bank of Jacksonville was the only bank still standing. William Boyd Barnett died September 2, 1903, and Bion renamed the institution, Barnett Bank, in his father's honor. In 1926, the Barnett National Bank Building was opened to house the company's operations and was built in the popular Chicago school style of architecture. At 18 stories, it was the tallest skyscraper in the city and remained so until 1954. The bank survived various economic downturns and crises, including the Great Depression, ultimately emerging stronger. When Barnett died in 1958 at the age of 101, Barnett Bank had come to be known as \\"Florida's Bank\\". The bank continued to grow with the acquisition of many more Florida banks over the next two decades. However, under Chairman of the Board Hugh Jones, Barnett Bank was slow to become involved in the rapidly evolving interstate banking mergers of the 1970s and 80s. Though eventually Barnett did make some purchases of out-of-state banks, starting in Georgia, it did so without growing its own brand recognition. While technically, according to federal statute, one bank cannot own another bank in another state, they can both be owned by the same holding company. Barnett, like other banks, grew across state lines in this way. But unlike other such banks, Barnett did not change the names of its new holdings, keeping the Barnett name exclusively within Florida. Ultimately, this weakened the company's stock, as the perception lingered that Barnett was not a major player in the area of mergers and acquisitions. Despite its slower than average growth, the holding company built a new corporate headquarters building in downtown Jacksonville: announced in 1987 and occupied in 1993, the year Hugh Jones retired. At 42 stories, the Barnett Center was the highest building in Jacksonville, and the second-tallest in Florida as of 2010. ===Demise=== For many years, it looked like Barnett would be the only bank of Jacksonville's \\"Big Three\\" to ignore the lure of big money from nationwide banking conglomerates. Atlantic National Bank of Florida was the first to sell out to First Union in 1985/7, followed by Florida National Bank in 1990. But in 1997, Barnett CEO Charles Rice, who was named Jacksonville's highest paid individual among public companies at $4.5 million (excluding stock options), offered the company up for sale, just six weeks after a month spent at a drug rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcoholism. Charlotte-based NationsBank made the highest offer, and the deal was done. At the time of Barnett's demise, the company had an annual payroll of a quarter billion dollars spread among 6,800 employees. Rice, who had publicly stated more than a decade earlier that he would never sell Bion Barnett's bank to any of its competitors, became board chairman of NationsBank. However, less than a year later, NationsBank purchased Bank of America and took the Bank of America name, and Rice himself was forced out as chairman, becoming vice chairman of corporate development. More than a few of those who lost their jobs found the situation ironic. After retiring in early 2001, Rice died in a swimming pool accident in December 2008. ==Volunteering== In the 1980s, CEO Hugh Jones began a corporate-wide program of giving back to their communities. All the bank's employees, which numbered 1,000, were encouraged to donate time to the charitable cause of their choosing. The Community Involvement Initiative resulted in over 40,000 hours of assistance to worthy projects where they lived. As of 2019, the reinforced concrete Barnett Center (now, the Bank of America Tower) remains the tallest building in Jacksonville. ==Naming dispute== In late 2000 financier Reid Mack secured the Florida corporate names to three former Barnett Bank entities; Barnett Mortgage Company, Barnett Lending Services, and Barnett Credit Services. Bank of America fought over the intellectual property rights to the names, and over the subsequent years Mr. Mack abandoned the possible use to the names. ==Historic preservation== The Barnett Historic Preservation Foundation, Inc. was created in December, 1997, after NationsBank purchased Barnett. Former Barnett president Allen Lastinger joined several other bank officers to create a non-profit organization to preserve and document Barnett's historical legacy. They acquired the company archives containing annual reports, investor presentations, press releases, correspondence, miscellaneous ledgers, videos and account books; then solicited former employees for other material, including photographs, scrapbooks, news clippings, marketing materials and employee publications. Over 70 interviews were conducted which generated 3,000 pages of transcripts that were included in an oral history component. In 2001, the Barnett Bank collection was donated to the Florida State Archives, which also holds the Florida State Department of Banking records, as well as records from other defunct banks. ==References== ==External links== *Barnett Historic Preservation Foundation Category:Bank of America legacy banks Category:Banks disestablished in 1997 Category:Banks established in 1877 Category:Defunct companies based in Florida Category:Defunct banks of the United States Category:Banks based in Jacksonville, Florida Category:American companies established in 1877 Category:Laura Street Category:1877 establishments in Florida ","title":"Barnett Bank"},{"id":"7791992","text":"Kristin M. Shepard is a fictional character on the American television series Dallas, played by Mary Crosby (1979–1981) and, briefly, by Colleen Camp (1979). The character also made one appearance on Dallas 's spin-off series, Knots Landing, during its second season. ==Character background== Kristin was Sue Ellen Ewing's scheming younger sister, who later has an affair with Sue Ellen's husband, J.R. ==Storylines== The character of Kristin first appeared on Dallas during the second season in the company of her mother, Patricia Shepard (Martha Scott). Patricia was always proud that her daughter Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) had married into the Ewing family. Patricia was hoping her younger daughter Kristin (then portrayed by Colleen Camp) would also find a successful man to marry. Kristin spent some time at Southfork Ranch and J.R. (Larry Hagman) came up with a plan for Kristin to seduce Bobby. (Bobby had just recently separated from his new bride Pam, and J.R. was plotting to break them up for good.); J.R.'s plan backfired. Bobby wasn't interested in Kristin romantically and nothing happened. Bobby and Pam reconciled. Kristin left town for a while. Kristin returned to Dallas at the beginning of the third season (now portrayed by Mary Crosby). J.R. offered Kristin a job working for him at Ewing Oil and a condo for her to live in. Eventually, J.R. and Kristin began a long term affair. Kristin helped J.R. by finding out valuable information from J.R.'s business partners. J.R. failed to come through on the promises he made to Kristin that she would be rewarded for the spying she had done. Kristin became bitter with J.R., feeling he had betrayed her. J.R. had also managed to anger many of his business partners and family members. J.R. was shot by an unknown assailant at the end of Dallas's third season.Rettenmund, Matthew, Totally Awesome 80s: A Lexicon of the Music, Videos, Movies, TV, St. Martin's Press, October 1996, pp. 143, Early in the fourth season, Sue Ellen (falsely accused of shooting J.R.) realized that her sister Kristin had shot J.R. and the truth came out in a poolside conversation between the three of them.Facts on File 1980 Yearbook p905 Before J.R. (in a wheelchair) had a chance to digest this news flash, Kristin revealed that she was pregnant with J.R.'s child. Instead of pressing charges against Kristin for the shooting, J.R. sent her packing out of town and agreed to send her a monthly check for living expenses. At the end of the fourth season, Kristin returned yet again claiming to have given birth to her and J.R.'s son and wanting money. She is soon thereafter found drowned in the Southfork Ranch swimming pool. She had overdosed on drugs and, in her stupor, fell and hit her head and went over the balcony railing, landing in the pool. After Kristin's death, her son Christopher is adopted by Bobby and Pam Ewing. It was later revealed by Bobby that Kristin actually miscarried J.R.'s baby. Kristin then married petty criminal Jeff Farraday (who was the same blood type as J.R.) and gave birth to Christopher. She later returned to Dallas leading J.R. to believe Christopher was his son and trying to blackmail him, ultimately leading to her death. Kristin made a final appearance in the series finale. In that episode, J.R. experiences visions of what the world would be like if he had never been born. In this setting, Kristin initially appears to be a prostitute, which J.R. finds predictable. She then informs her client that she is actually a police officer conducting a sting, at which J.R. is incredulous. The client then offers Kristin a large donation for the Police Benevolent Association if she will let him off, to which she agrees. After the man leaves, it is revealed that Kristin is actually a con artist, which gains J.R.'s approval. ==Knots Landing guest appearance== Before her last appearance on Dallas at the end of the fourth season, Kristin resurfaced on the Dallas spin-off series Knots Landing, appearing on the December 18, 1980, episode of the second season of Knots Landing. Kristin had been living in Los Angeles after leaving Dallas, and was arrested at a party while possessing drugs. She contacted Valene Ewing in an attempt to get out of jail and is invited to stay with Val and Gary, who is not happy to see her there knowing fully that Kristin was as conniving as Sue Ellen, while she gets back on her feet. Kristin tried to form a relationship with the Ewings' neighbor Kenny Ward, who was separated from his wife Ginger at the time. Kristin and Kenny's relationship gets to a point to where Kenny takes Kristin to his home, only to have Ginger walk in on them while Kristin is attempting to seduce Kenny. Ginger promptly sued Kenny for divorce shortly thereafter. Kristin came clean and admitted that she was pregnant to Val and Gary, and said that she only tried to seduce Kenny in order to give her baby a father. The closing scene has Gary and Kristin talking about how they were both the black sheep of their families. Kristin leaves Knots Landing shortly afterwards. Not once during this episode, is it mentioned that she was responsible for the shooting of J.R., nor that the real father of her baby was J.R. ==References== ==External links== Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1979 Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Fictional secretaries Category:Crossover characters in television ","title":"Kristin Shepard"},{"id":"7791994","text":"In logic, the formal languages used to create expressions consist of symbols, which can be broadly divided into constants and variables. The constants of a language can further be divided into logical symbols and non-logical symbols (sometimes also called logical and non-logical constants). The non-logical symbols of a language of first-order logic consist of predicates and individual constants. These include symbols that, in an interpretation, may stand for individual constants, variables, functions, or predicates. A language of first-order logic is a formal language over the alphabet consisting of its non-logical symbols and its logical symbols. The latter include logical connectives, quantifiers, and variables that stand for statements. A non-logical symbol only has meaning or semantic content when one is assigned to it by means of an interpretation. Consequently, a sentence containing a non-logical symbol lacks meaning except under an interpretation, so a sentence is said to be true or false under an interpretation. These concepts are defined and discussed in the article on first-order logic, and in particular the section on syntax. The logical constants, by contrast, have the same meaning in all interpretations. They include the symbols for truth- functional connectives (such as \\"and\\", \\"or\\", \\"not\\", \\"implies\\", and logical equivalence) and the symbols for the quantifiers \\"for all\\" and \\"there exists\\". The equality symbol is sometimes treated as a non-logical symbol and sometimes treated as a symbol of logic. If it is treated as a logical symbol, then any interpretation will be required to interpret the equality sign using true equality; if interpreted as a non-logical symbol, it may be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation. ==Signatures== A signature is a set of non- logical constants together with additional information identifying each symbol as either a constant symbol, or a function symbol of a specific arity n (a natural number), or a relation symbol of a specific arity. The additional information controls how the non-logical symbols can be used to form terms and formulas. For instance if f is a binary function symbol and c is a constant symbol, then f(x, c) is a term, but c(x, f) is not a term. Relation symbols cannot be used in terms, but they can be used to combine one or more (depending on the arity) terms into an atomic formula. For example a signature could consist of a binary function symbol +, a constant symbol 0, and a binary relation symbol <. ==Models== Structures over a signature, also known as models, provide formal semantics to a signature and the first-order language over it. A structure over a signature consists of a set D, known as the domain of discourse, together with interpretations of the non-logical symbols: Every constant symbol is interpreted by an element of D, and the interpretation of an n-ary function symbol is an n-ary function on D, i.e. a function Dn → D from the n-fold cartesian product of the domain to the domain itself. Every n-ary relation symbol is interpreted by an n-ary relation on the domain, i.e. by a subset of Dn. An example of a structure over the signature mentioned above is the ordered group of integers. Its domain is the set {\\\\mathbb Z} = {…, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, …} of integers. The binary function symbol + is interpreted by addition, the constant symbol 0 by the additive identity, and the binary relation symbol < by the relation less than. ==Informal semantics== Outside a mathematical context, it is often more appropriate to work with more informal interpretations. == Descriptive signs == Rudolf Carnap introduced a terminology distinguishing between logical and non-logical symbols (which he called descriptive signs) of a formal system under a certain type of interpretation, defined by what they describe in the world. A descriptive sign is defined as any symbol of a formal language which designates things or processes in the world, or properties or relations of things. This is in contrast to logical signs which do not designate any thing in the world of objects. The use of logical signs is determined by the logical rules of the language, whereas meaning is arbitrarily attached to descriptive signs when they are applied to a given domain of individuals.Carnap, Rudolf, Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications. == See also == * Logical constant == References == ;Notes * == External links == * Semantics section in Classical Logic (an entry of Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) Category:Logic symbols Category:Formal languages ","title":"Non-logical symbol"},{"id":"7792015","text":"The following is a list of television broadcasting licences held by Asian Television Network: ==Launched (On the air)== * ATN Aastha TV (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN ARY Digital (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN B4U Movies (ATN Hindi Movie Channel 3) * ATN B4U Music (ATN- Music Network One (Hindi Music) - AMN1) * ATN Bangla (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Brit Asia TV (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Channel (SATV) * ATN Colors Bangla (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Colors Marathi (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Colors Rishtey (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Cricket Plus (ATN - Asian Sports Network) * ATN DD Bharati (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN DD India (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN DD News (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN DD Sports (ATN - Cricket Channel I) * ATN DD Urdu (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Food Food (ATN South Asian Cooking Channel 1) * ATN Gujarati (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN IBC Tamil (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Jaya TV (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Life (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Max 2 (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Movies (ATN Hindi Movie Channel 4) * ATN MTV India (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN News (ATN South Asian English News Channel 2) * ATN News18 India (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN PM One (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Punjabi (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Punjabi 5 (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Punjabi Plus (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN SAB TV (ATN Comedy Channel One) * ATN Sikh Channel (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Sony Aath (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Sony Mix (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Sony TV (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN SVBC (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Tamil Plus (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Times Now (ATN – South Asian News – English) * ATN Urdu (Operates as exempt Cat. 2 Ethnic service) * ATN Zoom (ATN – Music Network Two (Hindi Music)) * CBN (ATN Cricket Channel One) ==Yet to launch== * ATN Caribbean Channel Two * ATN Hindi Movie Channel 5 * ATN Urdu News Channel 1 ==Did not launch (License has expired)== * ATN- Arabic News Channel * ATN- Bangla Channel Two * ATN- Cricket Channel I * ATN- Cricket Channel II * ATN Cricket Channel Two * ATN – Hindi Movie Channel Two * ATN- Malayalam Channel One * ATN- Malayalam Channel Two * ATN- Music Network Three (Tamil Music) - AMN3 * ATN- Music Network Two (Hindi Music) - AMN2 * ATN- South Asian News- Hindi (Pay service) * ATN- South Asian News- Hindi/English (Pay service) * ATN – South Asian News – Hindi * ATN – South Asian News – Hindi/English * ATN- South Asian News - Tamil * ATN- Urdu Channel Two * ATN- Urdu Channel Three * Hindi Movie Channel * Telegu Channel Category:Lists of television channels ","title":"List of broadcasting licences held by Asian Television Network International Limited"},{"id":"7792030","text":"A urine collection device or UCD is a device that allows the collection of urine for analysis (as in medical or forensic urinalysis) or for purposes of simple elimination (as in vehicles engaged in long voyages and not equipped with toilets, particularly aircraft and spacecraft). UCDs of the latter type are sometimes called piddle packs. Similar devices are used, primarily by men, to manage urinary incontinence. These devices attached to the outside of the penile area and direct urine into a separate collection chamber such as a leg or bedside bag. There are several varieties of external urine collection devices on the market today including male external catheters also known as urisheaths or Texas/condom catheters, urinals and hydrocolloid-based devices. External products should not be used by any individual who experiences urinary retention without overflow incontinence. ==Description== A urine collection device allows an individual to empty his or her bladder into a container hygienically and without spilling urine. ===Condom catheters=== Condom catheters, also known as Male external catheters, urisheaths, or Texas catheters, are made of silicone or latex (depending on the brand/manufacturer) and cover the penis just like a condom but with an opening at the end to allow the connection to the urine bag. The sheath is worn over the penis and looks like a condom (hence the name). It stays in place by use of an adhesive, that can either be built into the sheath or come as a separate adhesive liner. The urine gets funneled away from the body, keeping the skin dry at all times. The urine runs into a urine bag that is attached at the bottom of the external catheter. During the day, a drainable leg bag can be used, and at night it is recommended to use a large-capacity bedside drainage bag. Male external catheters are designed to be worn 24/7 and changed daily – and can be used by men with both light and severe incontinence. Male external catheters come in several sizes and lengths to accommodate anatomical variation. It is very important that the male external catheter / urisheath fits well – both the diameter and the length. Different manufacturers have small measuring guides that can be used to measure what size is needed before ordering a sample. If you do not get measured correctly leakage and skin irritation can occur. ==Urinals== Urinals are a class of device which does not attach to the body. Instead, these external collection systems can be placed against the urinary opening during voiding and removed once voiding is complete. These are commonly used by hunters and sportsmen who may spend long periods away from a bathroom. These are not appropriate for men with urinary retention or who experience involuntary urine leakage. ==Use== ===Managing incontinence=== Penile external catheters /urisheaths combined with urine bags are preferred over absorbent products – in particular when it comes to ‘limitations to daily activities’.Chartier_kastler E et al.: Randomized, crossover study evaluating patient preference and the impact on quality of life of urisheaths vs. absorbent products in incontinent men, BJU Int. 2011 Jul; 08(2):241-7 Advantages also include discretion, less water retention at the skin surface, and the potential for 24 hour use. Complications can increase in severity and frequency over time. Up to 40% of condom catheter users will develop a urinary tract infection with long-term use.Ouslander, J., Greengold, B., Chen, S.,, “External Condom Catheter Use and Urinary Tract Infections Among Incontinent Male Nursing Home Patients” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Vol. 35, 1987. 15% of long term users may develop skin injuries, including inflammation, ulceration, necrosis, gangrene and constriction of the penis.Golji, H., “Complications of External Condom Drainage,” Paraplegia (19), 1981. Sizing can also prove difficult for some men, leading to dislodgement of the catheter and urine spillage during voiding (commonly referred to as pop- offs or blow-offs). 1.3% of condom catheter users will develop a bladder or renal stone requiring medical treatment.Stelling, J., RN, MSN, CRR, Hale, P., RN, BSN, CRRN, “Research update: derived protocol for changing condom catheters in males with spinal cord injury”, Pushin' On Newsletter, Vol 12[1]Winter, 1994. Access online: . May 19, 2011. While the line of causation is not well established, urinary retention from inefficient elimination while catheterized may allow more mineral buildup and encourage crystal growth. ===Urinalysis=== Special UCDs exist for the collection of urine samples for subsequent urinalysis. They range from a simple plastic cup to elaborate devices designed to collect specific volumes or types of urine samples at various points in the micturition process. ===Aircraft pilots=== A common use of UCDs is in military fighter aircraft. Small aircraft such as fighter planes are not equipped with toilets, but pilots are sometimes required to fly them for several hours continuously. Since most people produce enough urine to fill their bladders after only a few hours under normal conditions, some method must be provided to allow a pilot to urinate without leaving their seat in the cockpit. A UCD makes this possible. UCDs are also used on spacecraft and occasionally in other vehicles, for the same reasons. A typical UCD consists of a small container with a dehydrated sponge inside, connected to a tube which in turn is connected to a funnel-like orifice that is adapted to the user's anatomy. The user simply holds the funnel near or on their urethral opening and urinates into the tube, with the collected urine saturating the sponge (which may be impregnated with disinfectants and odor-control substances) and filling the container. UCDs are designed to be used in cramped quarters without requiring that the user rise from his seated position in the cockpit. In most cases, the user wears special clothing that can easily be opened to permit use of the UCD (e.g., special zippers in flight suits). , technologies which did not require opening of the flight suit began to emerge, such as the \\"Advanced Mission Extender Device\\" (AMXD), which includes a pump for draining urine into a collection bag. ==See also== *Invasive methods of urine collection: **Urinary catheterization **Suprapubic cystostomy *Stadium buddy *P-valve == References == Category:Medical equipment Category:Urine Category:Urinary incontinence Category:Urology ==External links== *GeeWhiz catheters (a brand) ","title":"Urine collection device"},{"id":"7792034","text":"The Kálfsvísa (\\"Kálfr's vísa\\", Kálfr being maybe the name of its authorSimek, Rudolf.

Scandinavia Online AB, 226 F.3d 35 (1st Cir. 2000), was a civil case filed in 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. It received considerable attention in the online community because it involved reverse engineering and cryptanalysis of content-control software, allegedly in violation of copyright law and a clickwrap license agreement. In early 2000, Eddy L. O. Jansson and Matthew Skala reverse engineered the content-control package Cyber Patrol and published a report titled The Breaking of Cyber Patrol 4 detailing what they found, including a cryptanalysis of the CRC-32-based hash function that concealed the configuration password and Web site and Usenet newsgroup blacklists. They commented critically on the content of the blacklist, and highlighted apparent errors in it, innocuous sites and newsgroups blocked as objectionable for no visible reason. Along with the essay, they included software in C and Delphi demonstrating the attacks and allowing users to disable the package, change its configuration, or browse the blacklists in decrypted form. The break was widely reported on March 11, 2000. On March 15, Microsystems Software, the publisher of Cyber Patrol, and Mattel, its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, Scandinavia Online and Islandnet. They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in Sweden and Skala and Islandnet were located in Canada. They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, in the case of Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the clickwrap license agreement on Cyber Patrol, interference with advantageous business relations, conversion, and theft of trade secrets. Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself. In response to demands from the plaintiffs, Scandinavia Online deleted Jansson's Web site and Islandnet asked Skala to remove his link to Jansson's (now non-existent anyway) Web site. The document and software had already been mirrored on many sites worldwide, however. The plaintiffs asked for, and received, a temporary restraining order against distribution of what they termed the \\"bypass code\\", and were authorized to serve it by email on mirror sites, along with a subpoena demanding the identities of every Web user who accessed the information. Some commentators dubbed these email-distributed subpoenas \\"spampoenas\\"; use of email for official service of court documents was, and remains, highly unusual if not absolutely unheard of. On March 27, Skala announced that he had settled the cases against him (including one filed in a Canadian court as well as the US case) out of court and that Jansson was close to doing the same, with an agreement to stop distributing the essay and software and assign its copyrights to the plaintiffs. Other parties had become involved, however, including three mirror site operators associated with Peacefire and backed by the ACLU. The suit continued with the main issue being whether those mirror sites would also be forced to stop distributing the material. When their motions on that topic were dismissed, the mirror sites took that as an indication that they could continue to distribute it safely. Meanwhile, some controversy erupted when news sources suggested that the exploit software had been released under the GPL, making any restriction on its distribution problematic. Statements from Jansson and Skala denying any intention to place it under the GPL, the lack of any copyright notice in Skala's code, and a vague nonstandard GPL notice in Jansson's code, made it fall apart as a possible GPL test case. In 2001, Jansson stated on his Web site that he had in fact intended his code to be under the GPL after all, even if he had not put in the proper notices to make that stick. At the time of the case, the DMCA was not relevant because its enforcement was under suspension pending a review by the United States Copyright Office of whether exceptions to its provisions should be made. Lawrence Lessig nonetheless used the Microsystems case as an example of tension between the DMCA and the First Amendment in his essay Battling Censorware; and when the Copyright Office issued their rulemaking on DMCA exemptions, they also cited this case in their discussion of why reverse engineering of content-filter blacklists was one of only two categories of activities exempted. ==References== *Slashdot article on the case *Wired news article on the case ==External links== * *Amicus brief from law professors and ACM committee, supporting the mirror site appeal Category:Canadian copyright law Category:Cryptography law Category:2000 in United States case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit cases Category:United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts cases ","title":"Microsystems Software, Inc. v.

Roe Anderson Robert Moran (January 26, 1857 – March 27, 1943) was a prominent Seattle shipbuilder who served as the city's mayor from 1888 to 1890. Today he is primarily remembered for Moran Brothers Co. shipbuilders, his work as mayor to rebuild after the Great Seattle fire, and his large estate on Orcas Island, which became a resort and Moran State Park. ==Biography== left Two tall ships at the Moran Bros. Company docks, late 19th century A native of New York City, Moran was 18 when, in 1875, he arrived penniless in Seattle, a frontier outpost in the Pacific Northwest, which had been settled in November 1851, and only incorporated between 1865 and 1869. After years of working on steamboats he earned enough money to send for his family and, by 1882, he and his brothers started a marine repair business at Yesler's wharf. The Moran Brothers Company prospered during the Klondike Gold Rush when, among other projects, they built a fleet of twelve paddlewheel riverboats (hull Nos. 9–20), which were successfully delivered to the Yukon River. In 1888, 31-year-old Robert Moran was elected the Republican mayor of Seattle.Dave Wilma, Voters elect businessman Robert Moran as mayor of the City of Seattle on July 9, 1888, HistoryLink. Accessed 9 November 2007. In those early years, the town's mayors were elected in July for a one-year term. Near the end of his service, on June 6, 1889, the Great Seattle Fire destroyed most of the central business district. Moran's leadership in coordinating the recovery activities won him a second term in the following month's election. Through the period of his mayoralty, he was instrumental in the successful rebuilding of businesses, including Moran Bros., which was destroyed in the fire. His political connections were also very helpful in securing government contracts for his shipbuilding company. Among his administration's rebuilding efforts was the public overhaul of Seattle's water system and the establishment of a savings and loan association, which later became Washington Mutual. Moran Mansion (2007) Following his mayoral service, Moran devoted all his efforts to his shipbuilding business and, in 1904, climaxed his career with his shipyard's launch of the USS Nebraska, Washington state's only battleship. He was told in 1905 that he had one year to live, and retreated to Orcas Island in Puget Sound's San Juans, where he built the Moran Mansion—surrounded at that time by of land—that is now the centerpiece of Rosario Resort. He sold the shipbuilding company for an undisclosed price between US$2.5 and 3.5 million in 1906.\\"Moran Ship Plant Sold\\", New York Times, March 18, 1906. Accessed November 9, 2007. Moran spent the remainder of his life in retirement on Orcas Island. In 1916, he had a yacht built called the Sanwan, though it seems that ship saw little use. Influenced by chance encounters with conservationist John Muir, he donated of Rosario to the state of Washington for preservation, which became Moran State Park in 1921. Following the death of his wife in 1932, he put the estate up for sale, however when he did finally sell it years later, it was at a fraction of its cost. From there he moved into a smaller home on Orcas. He died in 1943 and was buried in the Moran family plot in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * * ===Archives=== * Robert Moran Papers. 1889-1925. .42 cubic feet (1 box).

They both taught at the University of Tennessee at Martin (UTM), where Nelson is professor emeritus in piano. They published the Nelson and Neal Piano Study Series (12 books of piano studies) for their children, and a book about their years on the road as traveling performers: Wave As You Pass by Harry Neal, 1958 (now out of print). ==Biography== Allison Nelson is a native of Largs Bay, South Australia, Australia. Note: includes a photo of Nelson playing piano. She is the younger daughter of Mr J Nelson, a local butcher, and her mother; she grew up with an older sister and brother – both were violinists. A child prodigy in piano, Nelson was well known throughout Australia at a young age. From the age of six her piano teacher was Miss Jessica Dix. At nine-years-old she attempted Grade II University musical examinations, \\"passing the examination with high honours.\\" According to The News reporter, \\"She is a keen lover of Beethoven, and includes Bach, Schumann, Paradies, Scarlatti, and Debussy in her repertoire.\\" She performed her first recital in April 1938 at the Adelaide Town Hall, which H Brewster-Jones of The Advertiser observed, \\"she created an excellent impression with her piano playing... Her precocious musical talent, amazing memory, and remarkable technical equipment made the recital memorable.\\" He opined, \\"For her final group, for which she received a double encore. Allison Nelson played Valse Brillante (Chopin) with ease and brilliance, Consolation (Liszt) with full appreciation of its expressive qualities: and the difficult \\"Novellete in D Major' (Schumann) with fluency but, naturally, not sufficient power. Its lyrical middle section had moments of very real beauty. Depending almost entirely upon wrist tension for her power, it is surprising what volume of tone she does produce from the instrument.\\" Harry Neal grew up in Paris, Tennessee, the son of William Fisher Neal, who was a prominent lawyer and politician in Henry County. They were married on New Year's Day, 1949 on Endsmeet Farm, just outside Philadelphia. Allison and Harry both studied piano at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Allison was one of few students to ever be accepted into Curtis without an audition. She toured Australia with Eugene Ormandy in the summer of 1944. He was impressed by her talent and arranged for her to have a place at Curtis. While there, Allison was a student of Rudolf Serkin, and Harry was a student of Isabelle Vengerova. Harry and Allison spent time in 1950 in Adelaide after her national tour for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, living with her family. It was then that they decided to end their solo careers and become a permanent piano duo before returning to the United States in mid-1951. The Neals and their three children, John, Kathie, and Elise were featured on This Is Your Life in 1958, where they received an Edsel station wagon as a gift. Ironically, Harry always said that Edsel was the best car he ever owned. Harry Neal died on September 15, 1968 in Paris, Tennessee, of an apparent heart attack. Allison Nelson completed her career as a professor of piano at The University of Tennessee at Martin, where she founded the UTM Piano Ensemble. As of 2013, it is still active under the direction of Dr. Elaine Harriss, who for many years performed with Dr. Nelson. ==References== == External links == * Nelson and Neal Piano Study Series * UTM Piano Ensemble Category:Living people Category:American classical pianists Category:Australian classical pianists Category:Classical piano duos Category:Married couples Category:21st- century classical pianists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nelson and Neal"},{"id":"7792155","text":"Avot de-Rabbi Nathan (), usually printed together with the minor tractates of the Talmud, is a Jewish aggadic work probably compiled in the geonic era (c.700–900 CE). Although Avot de-Rabbi Nathan is the first and longest of the \\"minor tractates\\", it probably does not belong in that collection chronologically, having more the character of a late midrash. In the form now extant it contains a mixture of Mishnah and Midrash, and may be technically designated as a homiletical exposition of the Mishnaic tractate Pirkei Avot, having for its foundation an older recension (version) of that tractate. It may be considered as a kind of \\"tosefta\\" or \\"gemarah\\" to the Mishna Avot, which does not possess a traditional gemarah. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan contains many teachings, proverbs, and incidents that are not found anywhere else in the early rabbinical literature. Other rabbinical sayings appear in a more informal style than what is found in Pirkei Avot. == The two existing forms (recensions) of Avot de-Rabbi Nathan == Touching its original form, its age, and its dependence on earlier or later recensions of the Mishnah, there are many opinions, all of which are discussed in S. Schechter's introduction. There are two recensions of this work, one of which is usually printed with the Babylonian Talmud in the appendix to Seder Nezikin [the sixteenth volume], preceding the so-called Minor Treatises, and another, which, until the late 19th century, existed in manuscript only. In 1887 Solomon Schechter published the two recensions in parallel columns, contributing to the edition a critical introduction and valuable notes. There were likely other recensions as well, since the medieval rabbis quote from other versions. In order to distinguish the two recensions, the one printed with the Talmud may be called A; and the other, B. The former is divided into forty-one chapters, and the latter into forty-eight. Schechter has proved that recension B is cited only by Spanish authors. Rashi knows of recension A only. A Hebrew manuscript of Avot de-Rabbi Nathan is today housed at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England, under the classification MS Oxford (Bodleiana) Heb. c. 24. In addition, MS Parma (Palatina) 2785 (de Rossi 327; Uncastillo/Spain, 1289), being a more precise copy of Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, has been used to correct errors in recension B. == Contents == The content of the two recensions differ from each other considerably, although the method is the same in both. The separate teachings of the Mishnah Avot are generally taken as texts, which are either briefly explained—the ethical lessons contained therein being supported by reference to Biblical passages—or fully illustrated by narratives and legends. Sometimes long digressions are made by introducing subjects connected only loosely with the text. This method may be illustrated by the following example: Commenting on the teaching of Simon the Just which designates charity as one of the three pillars on which the world rests,Pirkei Avot 1:2 Avot de-Rabbi Nathan reads as follows: The chapters of the two recensions of Avot de-Rabbi Nathan correspond with those of the Mishnah Avot as follows: *Chapters 1-11 of recension A and chapters 1-23 of recension B correspond with Pirkei Avot 1:1-11, dealing with saying of the Zugoth. *Chapters 12-19 of A and chapters 24-29 of B correspond with Pirkei Avot 1:12-18 and chapter 2, dealing with the teachings of Hillel, Shammai, Yohanan ben Zakkai and his disciples *Chapters 20-30 of A and chapters 30-35 of B correspond with Pirkei Avot chapters 3-4, an independent mishnaic collection *Chapters 31-41 of A and chapters 36-48 of B correspond with Pirkei Avot chapter 5, a collection of anonymous statements related by form == Authorship == Nathan the Babylonian, whose name appears in the title of the work under treatment, cannot possibly have been its only author, since he flourished about the middle of the 2nd century, or a generation prior to the author of the Mishnah. Besides, several authorities are quoted who flourished a long time after R. Nathan; for instance, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The designation \\"De-Rabbi Nathan\\" may be explained by the circumstance that R. Nathan is one of the first authorities mentioned in the opening chapter of the work (but not the first, that being Yose ha-Galili). Perhaps the school of the tannaite R. Nathan originated the work, however. Probably due to political differences that Rabbi Nathan had with Shimon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Nathan's name does not appear in the version of Avot compiled by redactor of the Mishna Rebbi (the son of the aforementioned Shimon ben Gamliel). However, it is known that Rabbi Nathan made an independent collection , and it is possible that Avot de-Rabbi Nathan derives from that source. It is also called Tosefta to Avot.see Horowitz, Uralte Toseftas, 1:6, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1889; Brüll's Jahrbücher, 9:139 et seq. The two recensions of the work in their present shape evidently have different authors, but who they were cannot be ascertained. Probably they belonged to the period of the Geonim, between the 8th and 9th centuries. ==Translations== *A Latin translation of Abot de-Rabbi Nathan was published by Franz Tayler, London, 1654: Tractatus de Patribus Rabbi Nathan Auctore, in Linguam Latinam Translatus. *An English version is given by M.

A common area of focus in the aviation industry has been the detection of cracking, which is commonly associated with fatigue. Automated blade condition monitoring technology has been developed for helicopters and has seen widespread adoption. The technique is routinely mandated by airworthiness authorities for engine inspections. Another commercial sector where such monitoring has become important is electricity generation, particularly on wind farms. ==Aviation== The propellers used to power numerous aircraft require regular inspections to ensure their integrity. The interval for such inspections is typically specified by the propeller's manufacturer. Regardless of being made of wood, metal or composite materials, visual inspections have typically been sufficient for observing any evidence of failure, sub-par condition, or damage sustained. However, some composite materials necessitate additional techniques such as ultrasound scans, to be performed to detect subsurface issues that may lack any external indications of their presence. Similarly, the fan blades of jet engines are susceptible to cracking and thus require routine inspections to be conducted by operators. Such inspections are typically performed during maintenance intervals, typically using a combination of visual and ultrasound scans performed upon each fan blade by technicians to detect any cracks. During October 2018, both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued updated airworthiness directives that specified more frequent inspections of the blades of the CFM International CFM56-7B turbofan powerplant used on many airliners. The in-flight failure of a rotorcraft's main rotor blade would likely lead to a serious life-jeopardising accident. Thus, manufacturers have developed detection techniques that guard against blade failure caused by fatigue cracking. A common method involves the pressurisation of the interior cavity of the rotor blade spar with nitrogen gas. Upon the formation of a crack, pressure is lost and a sensor built into the root of the rotor blade would detect this pressure change.\\"Sikorsky Helicopters\\", pp. 614–615. Flight International, October 10, 1963. Readouts from this sensor would be displayed via a cockpit display to the pilot. This system is intended to alert operators to cracking rotor blades in advance of a catastrophic failure, allowing for replacement blades to be installed in advance of such an outcome. American helicopter specialist Sikorsky has incorporated this technology onto several of its rotorcraft, including the S-61 series, S-65 series, and other models. In some cases, advanced detection of rotor blade flaws can allow for the repairs to be made, allowing for the blade to continue to be used. ==Electricity generation== The use of blade inspection methods has become commonplace amongst electricity-generating wind turbines. The detection of defects in blades, often attributed to fabrication, increases system reliability, as well as blade lifespan and enables more efficient condition-based maintenance; repairs can occur before more extensive damage levels is sustained, minimising turbine downtime. By the late 2010s, early practices for blade inspection have typically been determined to be incapable of detecting damage at an early stage. By this point, considerable research had been conducted to refine optimal techniques of performing non- destructive testing (NDI). Furthermore, it is believed that the requirement for comprehensive systems for blade inspection shall grow in line with the cost per blade and the associated lost revenue incurred from downtime. The blades of wind turbine are complex structures that incorporate composite materials. As such, they have reportedly posed unique challenges for inspection challenges, possessing relatively thick spar cap structures and porous bond lines, varying core material, along with a multitude of possible manufacturing defects and forms of in-service damage. Techniques have improved as a greater understanding of how blades undergo structural aging; critical evaluations of such techniques have aimed to measure their sensitivity, accuracy, repeatability, speed, ease of data interpretation, and ease of deployment. Researchers at Sandia National Labs determined that a through combination of several inspections methods may be required for optimal inspection sensitivity and reliability for both near-surface and deep, subsurface damage. Blade inspection techniques have been performed using fields such as ultrasound, microwave, thermography, shearography, and optical. Some of these techniques can be applied via remotely-operated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), reducing or eliminating the need for traditional manned inspections by trained climbers. ==References== ==External links== * Instruction: Blade Inspections via bladena.com * Sikorsky ABC flight trials via flightglobal.com * What is Blade inspection method? via youtube.com Category:Helicopter components ","title":"Blade inspection method"},{"id":"7792161","text":"The Sport and Recreation Alliance, formerly known as the Central Council of Physical Recreation, is the representative body for national sports organisations in the United Kingdom.

It is completely independent of any form of government control, has no responsibility for allocating funds, is strictly non-party and will support or oppose proposed measures only on the basis of their perceived value to sport and recreation Its members range from large national governing bodies of sport such as the Football Association and the Rugby Football Union to smaller members such as stoolball or kitesurfing. The members are divided by activity type into one of six divisions, covering Major Spectator Sports, Outdoor Pursuits, Movement and Dance, Water Recreation and Interested Organisations. Recently the Sport and Recreation Alliance opened its membership to County Sports Partnerships. The Sport and Recreation Alliance offers a range of services including advocacy on issues such as excessive bureaucracy in the governance of sport, access rights and events. The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), formerly the Central Council of Physical Recreative Training was established in 1935. The need and vision for such a body was seen by its founder Phyllis Colson \\"great woman who left an ineradicable mark upon the development of physical recreation in this country\\".Service to Sport, H.Justin Evans, 1974 This umbrella body brought together the many assorted sports bodies together with youth organisations, education authorities and industrial firms in pooling their knowledge experience and resources in providing every youngster with a chance to take part in enjoyable and health- giving physical activity.

Logtalk: Design of an Object-Oriented Logic Programming Language. PhD thesis. Universidade da Beira Interior It provides support for encapsulation and data hiding, separation of concerns and enhanced code reuse. Logtalk uses standard Prolog syntax with the addition of a few operators and directives. The Logtalk language implementation is distributed under an open source license and can run using a Prolog implementation (compliant with official and de facto standards) as the back-end compiler. ==Features== Logtalk aims to bring together the advantages of object-oriented programming and logic programming. Object-orientation emphasizes developing discrete, reusable units of software, while logic programming emphasizes representing the knowledge of each object in a declarative way. As an object- oriented programming language, Logtalk's major features include support for both classes (with optional metaclasses) and prototypes, parametric objects, protocols (interfaces), categories (components, aspects, hot patching), multiple inheritance, public/protected/private inheritance, event-driven programming, high-level multi-threading programming, reflection, and automatic generation of documentation. For Prolog programmers, Logtalk provides wide portability, featuring predicate namespaces (supporting both static and dynamic objects), public/protected/private object predicates, coinductive predicates, separation between interface and implementation, simple and intuitive meta-predicate semantics, lambda expressions, definite clause grammars, term-expansion mechanism, and conditional compilation. It also provides a module system based on de facto standard core module functionality (internally, modules are compiled as prototypes). ==Examples== Logtalk's syntax is based on Prolog: ?- write('Hello world'), nl. Hello world true. Defining an object: :- object(my_first_object). :- initialization((write('Hello world'), nl)). :- public(p1/0). p1 :- write('This is a public predicate'), nl. :- private(p2/0). p2 :- write('This is a private predicate'), nl. :- end_object. Using the object, assuming is saved in a my_first_object.lgt file: ?- logtalk_load(my_first_object). Hello world true. ?- my_first_object::p1. This is a public predicate true. Trying to access the private predicate gives an error: ?- my_first_object::p2. ERROR: error(permission_error(access, private_predicate, p2), my_first_object::p2, user) === Anonymous functions === ==Prolog back-end compatibility== As of October 2016, supported back-end Prolog compilers include B-Prolog, CxProlog, ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog, JIProlog, Lean Prolog , Qu-Prolog, Quintus Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, XSB, and YAP. Logtalk allows use of back-end Prolog compiler libraries from within object and categories. ==Developer tools== Logtalk features on-line help, a documenting tool (that can generate PDF and HTML files), an entity diagram generator tool, a built-in debugger (based on an extended version of the traditional Procedure Box model found on most Prolog compilers), a unit test framework with code coverage analysis, and is also compatible with selected back-end Prolog profilers and graphical tracers. ==Applications== Logtalk has been used to process STEP data models used to exchange product manufacturing information. It has also been used to implement a reasoning system that allows preference reasoning and constraint solving. ==See also== * Mercury (programming language) * Oz (programming language) * Prolog++ * Visual Prolog ==References== ==External links== * *Logtalking blog *From Plain Prolog to Logtalk Objects: Effective Code Encapsulation and Reuse (Invited Talk).

As part of this program, sites of cultural and historical significance have been selected, ranging from historic places and monuments to archaeological and architectural sanctuaries, museums, monasteries, as well as national parks, mountain peaks and other geological phenomena. Each of the chosen landmarks has its own individual seal, which is stamped onto pages of an official passport-like booklet issued by the Bulgarian Tourist Union (BTU). A booklet can be purchased at any tourist union center or on location at any of the sites and it costs a symbolic 1 lev. The booklet comes with a separate map which includes a list of the sites, their addresses and working hours. The maximum number of collectible stamps per booklet is 100 and, contrary to the movement's title, the exact number of official sites exceeds the number 100. A reward scheme has been developed to encourage collection of as many stamps as possible. Depending on the number of stamps collected, participants may receive bronze, silver or gold badges. 25 stamps earn bronze, 50 stamps earn silver and 100 stamps (a complete booklet) earn gold. The National Organizational Committee of the BTU holds an annual lottery for the previous year's badge earners every August. Prizes include domestic and overseas excursions, bicycles, tents, sleeping bags, and other travel-related items. Some landmarks in the original program highlighted Bulgaria's Communist government, which collapsed on November 10, 1989. In 2003 the BTU removed many of these sites from the official list.

Anne Henriette and her older twin sister Princess Louise Élisabeth were born at the Palace of Versailles on 14 August 1727, to Louis XV of France and queen Maria Leszczyńska. While the birth of the twins was considered a political disappointment as Salic Law disqualified them as heirs to the throne, their father, the King was delighted, and commented that after talk of him not being able to be a father, he was now the father of two. Along with her twin, she was baptised at Versailles on 27 April 1737. Henriette was named after her paternal great-great grandmother Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans, with Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon and Louise Anne de Bourbon as her godparents. As the legitimate daughter of the king, she was a fille de France, but as the younger of the twins, she was referred as Madame Seconde; as an adult, she became known as Madame Henriette, or only Madame, as the eldest daughter of the king present in Versailles after the marriage of her sister. The eldest children of Louis XV, the twins Élisabeth and Henriette, Marie-Louise, Adélaïde and their brother, the Dauphin of France, were raised in Versailles under the supervision of the Governess of the Children of France, Marie Isabelle de Rohan, duchesse de Tallard, while their younger siblings, Victoire, Sophie, Therese and Louise, were sent to be raised at the Abbey of Fontevraud in June 1738. In 1739, Élisabeth left France to marry the Infante Philip, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain. Henriette was reportedly despondent about being separated from her twin. ===Adult life=== Madame Henriette as fire, 1751. Royal french children were allowed to participate in court life as well as arrange their own festivities even in childhood; those kept at court participated in court life from the age of twelve. From 1744 onward, Henriette and Adelaide accompanied their father to the Opera in Paris, and from 1746, they hunted with him five days a week. In 1744, Henriette and Adelaide were officially transferred from the royal nursery and the King created their own household, the Household of the Mesdames aînées ('Elder Mesdames') and appointed two ladies-in-waiting (dame pour accompagner Mesdames); two years later, they were given their own dame d'honneur.Luynes (Charles-Philippe d’Albert, duc de), Mémoires du duc de Luynes sur la cour de Louis XV (1735-1758), publiés sous le patronage de M. le duc de Luynes par Louis Dussieux et Eudore Soulié, Paris, Firmin Didot, 1860-1865, 17 vol. Henriette was considered to be a beauty and prettier than her elder twin. She was described as gentle and melancholic, reserved but intensely loyal, and gifted in music. She was evidently the favorite child of her father, and it was said that she had no enemies at court. Despite her beauty, no serious marriage negotiations were ever made for Henriette. In 1740, Louis François, Prince of Conti suggested a marriage between himself and Henriette to her father; when he became alone with the king during a hunt, explaining that he believed that he could make Henriette happy, and that such a marriage would mean that she would never have to leave her father and France; but the king did not react favorably to the proposal.Jules Soury: Les six Filles de Louis XV.Revue des Deux Mondes, 3e période, tome 3, 1874 (pp. 750-98). Henriette reportedly fell mutually in love with her cousin, Louis Philippe, heir to the House of Orléans, and wished to marry him.Jules Soury: Les six Filles de Louis XV.Revue des Deux Mondes, 3e période, tome 3, 1874 (p. 750-798). The King initially approved, but changed his mind, not wanting the house of Orleans too close to the throne. The plans were discontinued in 1743, when the duke married someone else. Her twin Élisabeth, who was described as ambitious, was not satisfied as the spouse of a prince without a throne; she kept in contact with the French court, and had already by 1740 established a network of contacts there to assist her in her ambitions; Henriette was one of her most fervent champions in this issue; the powerful Noailles and Maurepas allied with the queen to achieve the same, and the French ambassador at Madrid, Monseigneur Vaurdal, Archbishop of Rheims. Otherwise regarded as habitually apathetic about politics, Henriette was reportedly passionately devoted to working for the political ambitions of her twin, as was her younger sister Adelaide and her sister-in-law Infanta Maria Teresa. Henriette, as well as her siblings, disliked their father's extramarital liaisons because they caused their father to neglect their mother. Their discontent with their father's adultery was directed toward his mistresses, notably Madame de Pompadour, who from 1745 onward was the influential maitresse en titre. With her brother, the Dauphin Louis, and her sister, Madame Adélaïde, she called the powerful mistress Maman Putain (\\"Mother Whore\\"). When Louise Élisabeth returned from Parma for a year- long visit to Versailles in 1748, she and Madame de Pompadour became close friends, which led to a temporary estrangement between the sisters. In 1747, her brother Louis was forced to marry Maria Josepha of Saxony, shortly after the death of his beloved first spouse, Maria Teresa Rafaela, in childbirth. Louis was initially hostile toward his new wife, even more so when his only child with the Spanish Infanta died, but she eventually managed to win his affection upon advice from Henriette. ===Death=== Henriette died of smallpox in 1752 at the age of twenty-four. In February of that year, she had felt somewhat unwell and tired, but when the king asked her to accompany him on a sledge ride, she gave no signs of her discomfort, and accepted the invitation anyway. She was badly affected by the chilly weather, and died after just three days of illness. Her family was described as being in a \\"state of stupefaction over the rapidity of the illness.\\" Louis XV reacted with \\"violent\\" despair upon her death and gave orders for the highest honors around her funeral; in order to enhance public mourning, her remains were placed at the Tuileries instead of Versailles prior to the funeral, dressed in one of her finest dresses and made up so to appear alive. But the public funeral reception was not to the king's taste, as the people \\"drank, laughed and amused themselves\\", which was taken as a sign of the diminishing reputation of the monarchy, as the public interpreted the death of Henriette to be a sign of divine disapproval of the king's lifestyle. Her heart was interred in the Abbey of Val-de-Grace, while her remains were buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis, along with her sister Elisabeth. Her tomb, like other royal tombs at Saint-Denis, was destroyed during the French Revolution. Madame Campan later wrote: \\"Madame Henriette, twin sister of the Duchess of Parma, was much regretted, for she had considerable influence over the King’s mind, and it was remarked that if she had lived she would have been assiduous in finding him amusements in the bosom of his family, would have followed him in his short excursions, and would have done the honours of the 'petits soupers' which he was so fond of giving in his private apartments.\\"Madame Campan, Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, Project Gutenberg, retrieved 2-05-17 ==Ancestry== ==References== ===Notes=== *The majority of this article is based on a translation of the equivalent article of the French Wikipedia ==Further reading== * Zieliński, Ryszard (1978).

Jenna was also briefly played by Morgan Fairchild in 1978 and Francine Tacker in 1980. ==Casting== The character of Jenna Wade was originally portrayed by Morgan Fairchild for one episode in 1978; Jenna was then portrayed by Francine Tacker for two episodes in 1980. When the character was brought back in 1983, the part was recast for the second time, this time with Jenna being portrayed by Priscilla Beaulieu Presley; she would be the third and final actress to portray the character. Before her debut, Priscilla Presley described the character: \\"Jenna is her own woman. She's extremely self-reliant, she has lived in Europe and has a child. Just like me. Except that she's a bit more sophisticated than me. She has a lot of integrity, she's totally honest. I like her. How could I help but identify with her?\\". ==Background== Jenna was Bobby Ewing's first true love. Jenna's father, Lucas Wade, was an oilman and associate of Jock Ewing. Jenna lived on her father's ranch, which was about three miles from Southfork. Bobby would often ride over to visit her as a kid. Years before Bobby met Pam, Jenna was engaged to Bobby but ditched him at the altar when she ran off to Italy and married Italian count Renaldo Marchetta. Jenna subsequently gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte (nicknamed \\"Charlie\\") and, for years, she never revealed who was Charlie's biological father. ==Storylines== Jenna (portrayed by Morgan Fairchild) reappeared in Bobby's life in 1978 when her affair with Maynard Anderson, a married politician and business associate of Jock and J.R. Ewing, ended and she needed a friend to turn to. Jenna introduced Bobby to her daughter Charlie; Bobby was then lead to believe that he is the girl's father - however, Jenna denied this when confronted by Pam. In 1980, Jenna (now portrayed by Francine Tacker) is still in Dallas and has an unexpected encounter with Bobby. They renew their friendship while Pam is away in Paris on business. During this brief time, Bobby is tempted to sleep with Jenna. Bobby and Jenna (now portrayed by Priscilla Beaulieu Presley) reconnected for a third time in 1983, and they began seeing each other after Bobby's marriage to Pam ended. Bobby's brother J.R. always liked Jenna and was very supportive of her relationship with Bobby. Bobby again wanted to know who had fathered Jenna's daughter Charlie. After seeing Charlie's birth certificate (which named Bobby as Charlie's legal father), Jenna confessed that Renaldo Marchetta was actually Charlie's biological father and that she had listed Bobby as the legal father in order to protect her legal interests in future disputes with Marchetta over Charlie. Nonetheless, Jenna and Bobby got engaged in 1984; she once again jilted him on their wedding day to remarry Marchetta, but this time it was against her will and under threat. The pair were tracked down to a hotel where Marchetta was found shot dead, with Jenna holding the gun. She was accused of Marchetta's murder, but this was eventually resolved, and she once again became engaged to Bobby. Bobby broke off this third engagement with Jenna after deciding that he wanted to marry his ex-wife, Pam. During the \\"Dream Season\\", after Bobby had died, Jenna had a brief relationship with Bobby's cousin Jack Ewing, but this was cut short as Jenna became mentally unstable due to Bobby's death. Later, Jenna received counseling to help her accept Bobby's death; she also ended her differences with Pam. After the end of the \\"Dream Season\\", Jenna discovered that she was pregnant with Bobby's child; however, Bobby was now engaged to Pam. During Bobby and Pam's second wedding, Bobby's half-brother Ray Krebbs mentioned that Jenna was pregnant with Bobby's child. This caused problems between Ray and Bobby, especially after Jenna and Charlie moved in with Ray. In 1987, Jenna gave birth to Bobby's son, Lucas, named after her father. Jenna later married Ray, who adopted Lucas and raised him with Jenna despite Bobby being the father. The next year, after problems with the now-teenaged Charlie, Jenna escorted Charlie to Europe to attend boarding school. After returning to Dallas, she and Ray decided to relocate permanently to Switzerland to be away from the drama of the Ewings. ==Dallas (2012 TV series)== Since Ray's return to Dallas, there has been no mention of Jenna, Charlie or Bobby's son, Lucas. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1978 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional magazine editors Category:Fictional people in fashion ","title":"Jenna Wade"},{"id":"7792255","text":"The International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), also known as the Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry and Dr Panjwani for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, is a federally funded national research institute and national laboratory site managed by the University of Karachi for the Ministry of Energy (MoE) of the Government of Pakistan. The national site is known for its dedicated focus and research in primarily in organic chemistry and natural products but takes research in environmental cleanup and other fundamental branches of chemistry including the computational, green, medicinal, and protein chemistry. The site was established through the private funding made possible by the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976 before becoming certified for the federal funding and achieved its status as national laboratory site in its success years. The HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry 's research programs are functioning under the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), alongside with Center for Molecular Medicines and National Institute of Virology (NIV)— the national laboratory sites of the Ministry of Health to combat the emerging infectious diseases.. ==Overview== The national site has its genesis and long efforts led by the University of Karachi dedicated for educating and researching on natural product chemistry when the University of Karachi's Department of Chemistry established the \\"Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry\\" in 1967. Upon retiring from his public services as chairman of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui was employed as its chief scientist who was instrumental of establishing the national site who secured initial funding for his Institute of Chemistry when he witnessed his physicist colleagues establishing the national laboratory in physics in Nilore. The national laboratory site was finally established in its current form with the generous private funding ($500,000 in 1976, $2.25 million as of 2020) from the HEJ Foundation in 1976, and bares the name of Hussain Ebrahim Jamal. At the time, this represented the largest private donation in nation's history to establish the national laboratory site in the country. Later, the national laboratory site was certified for federal funding and began supporting his research efforts as parallel to KRL and PINSTECH from the sponsorship of the Ministry of Defense and later the Ministry of Energy. Atta- ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass spectrometers and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute which established the institute in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by Latif Ebrahim Jamal on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as \\"Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry\\", in the memory of late Husein Ebrahim Jamal. Atta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 1999, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on the retirement of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002 M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. The institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy, and Protein Chemistry. The institute hosted the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated. Additionally, the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN- International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences). In 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in the OIC region. In August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed to \\"Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories\\" by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief. In the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her father, Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train highly qualified manpower in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians, and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. Late Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005.

The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics Labor Force Survey estimated that there were about 5.7 million 10- to 14-year-old Bangladeshi children engaged in child labour. This number may have been as high as 15 million children. In 1993 employers in Bangladesh' ready-made garment (RMG) industry dismissed 50,000 children (c. 75 percent of child workers in the textile industry) out of fear of economic reprisals of the imminent passage of the Child Labor Deterrence Act (the Harkin Bill after Senator Tom Harkin, one of the US Senators who proposed the bill). The act which banned \\"importation to the United States of products which are manufactured or mined in whole or in part by children\\" would have resulted in the loss of lucrative American contracts. Its impact on Bangladesh's economy would have been significant as the export-oriented ready-made garment industry represents most of the country's exports. UNICEF sent a team of investigators into Bangladesh to learn what came of the children who were dismissed from their factory jobs. UNICEF's 1997 State of the World's Children report confirmed that most of the children found themselves in much more deplorable situations, such as crushing stones, scavenging through trash dumps, and begging on the streets.

The connection between NASCAR and fine wine is reflected in the labeling of some of the wines produced by Childress, featuring a checkered flag motif. ==History of wineries in North Carolina == In the mid-19th Century, there were some 25 wineries in North Carolina, with extensive independent vineyards, to the extent that North Carolina dominated the national market for American wines at the time. The Scuppernong grape was the primary source for North Carolina's 19th Century wine, as it had been for about two centuries. The Civil War ended that market dominance, through damage to the industry by loss of manpower and scarce capital, as well as through revocation of winemaking licenses due to regulatory retribution following the war. Wine production began to recover in the decades after the war through the early 20th Century. However, North Carolina voted to become a dry state in 1908 and that decision, coupled with the onset of Prohibition, ended winemaking in North Carolina. Repeal in 1933, followed by the passage by North Carolina's legislature in 1935 of laws permitting winemaking, began a rebirth, but it was several decades after World War II before North Carolina's wine industry would show significant growth. ==Origins, Operations and Wine Varietals at Childress Vineyards== While racing at California tracks in the 1970s, Richard Childress spent some of his off- track time at small wineries. He later explored vineyards in the Finger Lakes region in New York, following NASCAR's expansion to Watkins Glen. As he made friends with vineyard owners and winemakers, Childress began to consider starting his own vineyard. By the 1990s, Childress had purchased land, planted vines and by the end of the 90s was having his grapes custom-crushed, making wine to give to friends. Childress Vineyards broke ground in 2003 and the 35,000 square winery commenced operations in 2004. Located in the Yadkin Valley AVA, an American Viticultural Area, Childress' winemaker is Mark Friszolowski. Childress is part of a broader development of wine-grape growing and vineyards in North Carolina which has been gaining traction in the 21st Century, following a period of rapid growth beginning in the 1980s. Grapes are grown locally on the vineyard grounds, at Childress' home estate, as well as purchased from local growers. Classic European varietals produced include Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier white wines and Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah red wines, sparkling wines and dessert wines. In a nod to historic North American and North Carolina grape varieties, Childress also produces a line of muscadine (Vitis rotundifolia) wines, including a Scuppernong varietal, produced from a type of muscadine grape. Wines produced from scuppernong harken back to the 17th Century beginning of North Carolina's winemaking tradition. By 2005, the winery was producing 30,000 cases per year and was third largest in terms of production in North Carolina. The vineyards are located at the intersection of U.S. Route 52 and U.S. Route 64 in Lexington, North Carolina which is in the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina and its tasting room is open daily. There is also an Italian style Bistro open for lunch. Childress also holds special events including weddings and corporate functions, as well as free entertainment during the spring and fall. ==See also== *North Carolina wine *List of celebrities who own wineries and vineyards *Richard Childress Racing *Yadkin Valley Wine Festival ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tourist attractions in Davidson County, North Carolina Category:Wineries in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Davidson County, North Carolina ","title":"Childress Vineyards"},{"id":"7792342","text":"Flookburgh is an ancient village on the Cartmel peninsula in Cumbria, until 1974 part of Lancashire.

He was the eldest son of Alexander Brown of Ballymena, and Grace, daughter of John Davison (1764–1834) of Drumnasole. His younger brothers were George Brown (1787–1859), John Brown (1788–1852), and James Brown (1791–1877). At twelve years of age, he was sent with his brothers to be educated at the school of the Rev. J. Bradley at Catterick, North Yorkshire, until 1800 when he returned to Ireland. ==Career== Soon afterwards he sailed with his father and mother for the United States of America, and at Baltimore, Maryland, where his father continued the linen trade in which he had been engaged in Ireland, received in the counting-house his commercial education. In a few years the house at Baltimore became the firm of Alexander Brown & Sons, consisting of the father and his sons, William, John, George, and James. James established himself at New York City and John at Philadelphia, and on the death of their father the business, then the most extensive in the American trade, was continued by the four brothers, George remaining in Baltimore. In 1809, William returned to the United Kingdom, established a branch of the firm in Liverpool, and they shortly afterwards abandoned the exclusive linen business and became general merchants. The transactions of the firm soon extended so as to require further branches, Brown took on a partner, and the firm became known as Brown, Shipley & Co., Liverpool and London merchants. Brown, at one time, served as the chairman of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. The disastrous aspect of affairs in financial crisis of 1837, induced the brothers George and John, who had by this time realised ample fortunes, to retire from the firm, leaving William the eldest and James the youngest to continue the concern. Brown persuaded the Bank of England to advance him £2,000,000 to tide matters over in view of the firm's multiple interests. Brown only needed half the amount, which he repaid within six months. His business, both mercantile and banking, continued to increase, and in 1844 he held one sixth of the trade between Great Britain and the United States. \\"There is hardly,\\" declared Richard Cobden at this period, \\"a wind that blows, or a tide that flows in the Mersey, that does not bring a ship freighted with cotton or some other costly commodity for Mr Brown's house.\\" They now became bankers in the sense of conducting transmissions of money on public account between the two hemispheres, and in this pursuit and the business of merchants they acquired immense wealth. ===Political career=== In 1825, William took an active part in the agitation for the reform in the management of the Liverpool docks. He was elected an alderman of Liverpool in 1831, and held that office until 1838. He was the unsuccessful Anti-Cornlaw League candidate for South Lancashire in 1844. In 1846, Brown was elected Liberal M.P. for South Lancashire, and held the seat until 23 April 1859. In 1856, friction arose between the British and American governments because British consuls were enlisting recruits for the Crimean War, but this was largely allayed by Brown, who in an interview with Lord Palmerston, then prime-minister, explained the objections taken in America. In 1863, he was selected as High Sheriff of Lancashire. He was always an advocate of free trade, and particularly favoured the idea of a decimal currency. Sir W. Brown was the author of a pamphlet entitled Decimal Coinage. A Letter from W. Brown, Esq., M.P., to Francis Shand, Esq., Chairman of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, 1854. ===Philanthropy=== William Brown Street His name is probably best known by the munificent gift which he bestowed on his adopted town. He erected the Free Public Library and Derby Museum at Liverpool, which was opened on 8 October 1860, at a cost to himself of £40,000, the corporation providing the site and foundation and furnishing the building. At the inauguration of the volunteer movement in 1859, he raised and equipped at his own expense a corps of artillery, which ranked as the 1st brigade of Lancashire artillery volunteers. ==Personal life== St James's Gardens On 1 January 1810, he married Sarah Gibson (1780–1858), daughter of Andrew Gibson, Esq. of Ballymena, a magistrate of that shire. Before her death on 5 March 1858, they were the parents of two children, a daughter and a son: * Grace Brown (1812–1849), who married John Hargreaves of Hall Barn, Buckinghamshire, in 1831. * Alexander Brown (1817–1849), who married his cousin, Sarah Benedict Brown, daughter of Sir William's youngest brother, James Brown. He was created a baronet of Richmond Hill in the County Palatine of Lancaster' on 24 January 1863. He did not, however, live long to enjoy his honours, as he died at Richmond Hill, Liverpool, on 3 March 1864. As his son died on 8 October 1849, Brown's grandson, Lieutenant-colonel William Richmond Brown, succeeded to the baronetcy in 1864. On the proving of his will on 21 May 1864, the personalty was sworn under £900,000. ===Descendants=== Through his son Alexander, he was a grandfather of Lt. Col. Sir William Richmond Brown, 2nd Baronet, who served as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1873; James Clifton Brown (1841–1917), a Member of Parliament for Newbury; Sir Alexander Hargreaves Brown, 1st Baronet (1844–1922), the Liberal Party, and later Liberal Unionist, politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1906; and Louisa Brown Cobham. ==References== Attribution * * == External links == * Category:1784 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Liverpool Category:English bankers Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Lancashire Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1841–1847 Category:UK MPs 1847–1852 Category:UK MPs 1852–1857 Category:UK MPs 1857–1859 Category:High Sheriffs of Lancashire Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Lancashire Category:People from Ballymena ","title":"Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Richmond Hill"},{"id":"7792392","text":"Robert Sterling Clark (June 25, 1877 – December 29, 1956), an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune, was an American art collector, horse breeder, and philanthropist. ==Biography== Known by his middle name, Sterling Clark served in the United States Army in the Philippines and in China during the Boxer rebellion, where he served under General Smedley Butler. Butler, in 1934, claimed Clark had some connection to what Butler believed was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 to overthrow United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and make Butler the nation's dictator.Historians dismiss the allegations, noting that Butler was on the far left of the political spectrum while all the other \\"conspirators\\" were conservative businessmen. Following his graduation from Yale University in 1899 with a degree in engineering, Clark visited Paris, France and over the years would return there frequently, eventually maintaining a residence there. In Paris, he met actress Francine Clary whom he married in 1919. He owned several residences: New York City, Cooperstown, New York, \\"Sunridge Farm\\" in Upperville, Virginia, and Paris, France. ==Art collecting== A Girl Crocheting, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1875 Sterling Clark purchased his first Impressionist painting, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Girl Crocheting, in 1916. He and his wife Francine (1876–1960) continued to collect art rapidly and towards the end of their lives established their collection as a museum near the campus of Williams College in Williamstown Mass. They did this after originally making plans with his brothers Stephen Carlton Clark and F. Ambrose Clark to combine their collections in a single art museum in Cooperstown. After a falling out among the brothers, Sterling not only cancelled such plans but also withdrew his share of the family fortune from the collective trust. He established his own foundation and sold off or donated all of his property holdings in Cooperstown. He donated the Ernest Flagg designed neoclassic YMCA building commissioned by his mother, Elizabeth Scriven Clark, in 1898 to the village in 1932, and it now houses village offices, the library and the Cooperstown Art Association. Almost no communication between Stephen and Sterling occurred again.==Nicholas Fox Weber, The Clarks of Cooperstown: Their Singer Sewing Machine Fortune, Their Great and Influential Art Collections, Their Forty-year Feud (Alfred A. Knopf, 2007). Over the next five decades he and his wife collected numerous paintings by Renoir, plus dozens of paintings, sculptures and pastels by other Impressionist artists. In 1950, Sterling and Francine Clark chartered the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute as a home for their extensive art collection. The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts opened its doors to the public in 1955. According to Time magazine, \\"In building their $3,000,000 Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, the Clarks ignored costs (Local boosters boast that the marble for the new museum was the biggest single order in Vermont since the U.S. Supreme Court.) but insisted on quality.\\" Works in the collection included over 30 Renoirs as well as Dutch, Spanish and American painters such as Winslow Homer, Goya, Frans Hals, and Degas. ==1909 Expedition== He financed a 1909 Expedition which sought specimens from the Yellow River into Shaanxi and then to Gansu provinces of China. He recruited the explorer Arthur de Carle Sowerby as naturalist for the trip, later publishing a book with Sowerby about the expedition entitled Through Shên-kan: the account of the Clark expedition in north China, 1908-9. He established the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation which operates today from offices at 135 East 64th St., New York City. ==Horse racing interests== Clark raced horses in the United States and in Europe. In the United States, his filly, Current, was voted the 1928 retrospective American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, whilst in England Galatea II won the 1000 Guineas and Oaks in 1939. The most noted horse owned and bred by Mr. Clark was Never Say Die (1951–1975), a Kentucky bred chestnut colt, though conceived in Ireland, before being shipped 'in utero' to Jonabell Farm, Lexington, where Clark's breeding activities were centred. Raced in England, he won the 1954 Epsom Derby at odds of at 33 to 1. He was ridden by 18-year-old Lester Piggott, the youngest jockey to ever win the Derby. Never Say Die also won the Rosslyn Stakes (ENG) and St. Leger Stakes (Gr.1). Upon retirement, Clark gifted the horse to the National Stud. Following his marriage, Clark's interest in horses waned considerably. Yet during his lifetime he was known as a successful horse owner rather than as the art collector he's known as today. ==See also== *Business Plot ==References== *Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute *Robert Sterling Clark Foundation *Never Say Die pedigree * Time Magazine May 7, 1956 \\"Clark Art Institute ==Further reading== * Weber, Nicholas Fox.

In antiquity, it was one of the wealthiest cities in the region.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. II, pp. 161, 162 (\\"Leptis\\"). ==Name== The Punic name of the settlement was written () or (),Edward Lipiński, Itineraria Phoenicia (2004), p. 345.Brogan, Wilson, \\"Lepcis\\" in: The Oxford Classical Dictionary (4th ed. 2012), p. 821. signifying either a new \\"construction\\" or a \\"naval station\\". Phoenician colonies often duplicated their names, as with the two \\"New Towns\\" distinguished in English as Carthage and Cartagena. This name was hellenized Léptis (). Under the Romans, the Punic name was Latinized as Lepcis or Leptis. It was known variously as , ', or Leptiminus', all meaning \\"Lesser Leptis\\" to distinguish it from the \\"Greater Leptis\\" in what is now Libya. ==Geography== Leptis was located on the Gulf of Hammamet, the classical Gulf of Neapolis (), between Hadrumetum and Thapsus. It was located in the fertile coastal district of Emporia, in the region of Byzacium, the later Roman province of Byzacena.Pliny the Elder, v. 4. s. 3.Pomponius Mela, i. 7. § 2. ==History== ===Phoenician colony=== Leptis was established as a Tyrian colony, probably originally as a waypost on the trade route between Phoenicia and the Strait of Gibraltar. It appears in the periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, written in the middle or latter part of the fourth centuryBC, as one of the cities in the country of the legendary lotus-eaters.Pseudo-Scylax, Periplus, 110. ===Carthaginian town=== Like other Phoenician colonies, Leptis came to pay tribute to Carthage.Sallust, Bellum Jugurthinum, 19. After the First Punic War, Leptis was at the center of the Mercenary War, a revolt of the Carthaginian mercenaries led by Mathos. This was suppressed with difficulty through the coöperation of Hamilcar Barca and Hanno the Great in 238BC.Polybius, i. 87. Leptis recovered from the damage and, at the time of the Second Punic War, was one of the wealthiest cities of Emporia. Its tribute to Carthage was equivalent to one Attic talent ( of fairly pure silver) per day.Livy, xxxiv. 62. It was at Leptis that Hannibal's army disembarked on their return to Africa in 203BC.Livy, xxx. 25. In the following year, Leptis was one of few cities under Roman control in north Africa, the rest of Africa still remaining under the control of the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal.Appian, Bella Punica, xiii. 94. Following the conclusion of the war in 201BC, Emporia was overrun by Masinissa, who claimed the district by ancient right. The Carthaginians appealed to Rome for adjudication of the matter, as they were obliged to do by the treaty ending the war. The Roman Senate appointed a commission to look into the matter, including Scipio Africanus, the general credited with Carthage's recent defeat. Although Scipio was uniquely positioned to resolve the dispute, the commission left the rightful possession of Emporia undecided and Masinissa was able to organize much of the territory into the kingdom of Numidia. Leptis itself, however, remained unconquered. ===Roman city=== The region around Leptis came under direct Roman rule following the Third Punic War in 146BC. In Roman times, Leptis was a free city () with its own autonomous government. Local coins were minted with Greek legends (viz. ); later coins with Latin inscriptions may show its elevation to colony (') status or may have originated in Leptis Magna. The possession of Leptis became an important matter during Caesar's Civil War. In 49BC, Juba I of Numidia was at war with the Leptitani when the war was first carried over into Africa. Juba had long been an ally of Pompey and opposed to Caesar. Caesar's lieutenant Gaius Scribonius Curio deemed it safe to attack Utica, as Juba had left his own lieutenant Sabura in charge of the surrounding countryside. Curio routed a Numidian force with a night-time cavalry raid, but rashly engaged Sabura's main force and was annihilated at the Bagradas as Juba approached from Leptis with reinforcements.Caesar, De Bello Civili, ii. 37–44. At the beginning of January 46BC, Caesar arrived at Leptis and received a deputation from the city offering its submission. Caesar placed guards on the city gates to prevent his soldiers from entering the city or harassing its people and sent his cavalry back to their ships to protect the countryside, although the latter were ambushed by a Numidian force. Shortly afterward, Caesar moved his camp to Ruspina, leaving six cohorts at Leptis under the command of Gaius Hostilius Saserna.Hirtius, De Bello Africo, 6, 7, 9, 10. During the winter and spring of 46, Leptis was one of Caesar's primary bases and a source of provisions. A cavalry troop sent to Leptis for provisions intercepted a force of Numidian and Gaetulian soldiers, whom they took prisoner after a brief skirmish. Part of Caesar's fleet was anchored off Leptis, where they were taken unawares by Publius Attius Varus, one of Pompey's admirals, who burned Caesar's transports and captured two undefended quinqueremes. Learning of the attack, Caesar rode to Leptis and went in pursuit of Varus with his remaining ships, recapturing one of the quinqueremes along with a trireme. At Hadrumetum, he burned a number of Pompey's transports and captured or put to flight a number of galleys.Hirtius, De Bello Africo, 61–64. Leptis continued to flourish under the empire before Byzacena was ceded to the Vandals in AD442. The city was retaken by the Byzantine general Belisarius in 533, during the Vandalic War. It then formed part of the Praetorian Prefecture of Africa and later part of the Exarchate of Africa. The city was largely destroyed during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the latter part of the seventh century, although a ribat was built there, probably on the ruins of an earlier Byzantine fortress. The city itself was abandoned and never resettled. ==Religion== From the third century until its destruction, Leptis was represented by bishops in various councils of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Councils of Carthage in 256, 411, 484, and 641. The diocese was also involved in the great conflict of African Christianity as Catholic and Donatist bishops for the town appear on the lists of participants in these councils. Among the noted bishops was Laetus, described as a \\"zelous and very learned man\\", numbered among those bishops killed by the Vandal king Huneric, after the council of 484.Butler & Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: September, p. 41. ==See also== * Leptis Magna ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Pseudo-Scylax, Periplus. * Polybius, Historiae (The Histories). * Gaius Sallustius Crispus (Sallust), Bellum Jugurthinum (The Jugurthine War). * Gaius Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili (Commentaries on the Civil War). * Aulus Hirtius (attributed), De Bello Africo (On the African War). * Titus Livius (Livy), History of Rome. * Pomponius Mela, De Situ Orbis (On the Places of the World). * Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Historia Naturalis (Natural History). * Appianus Alexandrinus (Appian), Bella Punica (The Punic Wars). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1854). * Alban Butler & Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints: September, A&C; Black, (1995). * . ==External links== * Category:Phoenician colonies in Tunisia Category:Roman towns and cities in Tunisia ","title":"Leptis Parva"},{"id":"7792431","text":"Agrellite (NaCa2Si4O10F) is a mineral found in Quebec, Canada and a few other locations.

The process results in translated peptides or proteins that are associated with their mRNA progenitor via a puromycin linkage. The complex then binds to an immobilized target in a selection step (affinity chromatography). The mRNA-protein fusions that bind well are then reverse transcribed to cDNA and their sequence amplified via a polymerase chain reaction. The result is a nucleotide sequence that encodes a peptide with high affinity for the molecule of interest. Puromycin is an analogue of the 3’ end of a tyrosyl-tRNA with a part of its structure mimics a molecule of adenosine, and the other part mimics a molecule of tyrosine. Compared to the cleavable ester bond in a tyrosyl-tRNA, puromycin has a non-hydrolysable amide bond. As a result, puromycin interferes with translation, and causes premature release of translation products. Figure 1. mRNA-Polypeptide Fusion Formation. a. Ribosome moves along the mRNA template and nascent peptide is being made. When the ribosome reaches the 3’ end of the template, the fused puromycin will enter the A site of the ribosome. b. The mRNA-polypeptide fusion is released. All mRNA templates used for mRNA display technology have puromycin at their 3’ end. As translation proceeds, ribosome moves along the mRNA template, and once it reaches the 3’ end of the template, the fused puromycin will enter ribosome’s A site and be incorporated into the nascent peptide. The mRNA-polypeptide fusion is then released from the ribosome (Figure 1). To synthesize an mRNA-polypeptide fusion, the fused puromycin is not the only modification to the mRNA template. Oligonucleotides and other spacers need to be recruited along with the puromycin to provide flexibility and proper length for the puromycin to enter the A site. Ideally, the linker between the 3’ end of an mRNA and the puromycin has to be flexible and long enough to allow the puromycin to enter the A site upon translation of the last codon. This enables the efficient production of high-quality, full- length mRNA-polypeptide fusion. Rihe Liu et al. optimized the 3’-puromycin oligonucleotide spacer. They reported that dA25 in combination with a Spacer 9 (Glen Research), and dAdCdCP at the 5’ terminus worked the best for the fusion reaction. They found that linkers longer than 40 nucleotides and shorter than 16 nucleotides showed greatly reduced efficiency of fusion formation. Also, when the sequence rUrUP presented adjacent to the puromycin, fusion did not form efficiently. In addition to providing flexibility and length, the poly dA portion of the linker also allows further purification of the mRNA-polypeptide fusion due to its high affinity for dT cellulose resin. The mRNA-polypeptide fusions can be selected over immobilized selection targets for several rounds with increasing stringency. After each round of selection, those library members that stay bound to the immobilized target are PCR amplified, and non- binders are washed off. ==Method== Figure 2. Splint Aid Single Stranded mRNA/DNA T4 DNA Ligase Ligation The synthesis of an mRNA display library starts from the synthesis of a DNA library. A DNA library for any protein or small peptide of interest can be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis followed by PCR amplification. Usually, each member of this DNA library has a T7 RNA polymerase transcription site and a ribosomal binding site at the 5’ end. The T7 promoter region allows large-scale in vitro T7 transcription to transcribe the DNA library into an mRNA library, which provides templates for the in vitro translation reaction later. The ribosomal binding site in the 5’-untranslated region (5’ UTR) is designed according to the in vitro translation system to be used. There are two popular commercially available in vitro translation systems. One is E. Coli S30 Extract System (Promega) that requires a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5’ UTR as a ribosomal binding site; the other one is Red Nova Lysate (Novagen), which needs a ΔTMV ribosomal binding site. Once the mRNA library is generated, it will be Urea-PAGE purified and ligated using T4 DNA ligase to the DNA spacer linker containing puromycin at the 3’ end. In this ligation step, a piece of mRNA is ligated with a single stranded DNA with the help from T4 DNA ligase. This is not a standard T4 DNA ligase ligation reaction, where two pieces of double stranded DNA are ligated together. To increase the yield of this special ligation, a single stranded DNA splint may be used to aid the ligation reaction. The 5’ terminus of the splint is designed to be complementary to the 3’ end of the mRNA, and the 3’ terminus of the splint is designed to be complementary to the 5’ end of the DNA spacer linker, which usually consists of poly dA nucleotides (Figure 2). Figure 3. Selection Cycle. The ligated mRNA-DNA-puromycin library is translated in Red Nova Lysate (Novagen) or E. Coli S30 Extract System (Promega), resulting in polypeptides covalently linked in cis to the encoding mRNA. The in vitro translation can also be done in a PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) system. PURE system is an E. Coli cell-free translation system in which only essential translation components are present. Some components, such as amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNA synthases (AARSs) can be omitted from the system. Instead, chemically acylated tRNA can be added into the PURE system. It has been shown that some unnatural amino acids, such as N-methyl-amino acid accylated tRNA can be incorporated into peptides or mRNA-polypeptide fusions in a PURE system. After translation, the single- stranded mRNA portions of the fusions will be converted to heteroduplex of RNA/DNA by reverse transcriptase to eliminate any unwanted RNA secondary structures, and render the nucleic acid portion of the fusion more stable. This step is a standard reverse transcription reaction. For instance, it can be done by using Superscript II (GIBCO-BRL) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNA/DNA-polypeptide fusions can be selected over immobilized selection targets for several rounds (Figure 3). There might be a relatively high background for the first few rounds of selection, and this can be minimized by increasing selection stringency, such as adjusting salt concentration, amount of detergent, and/or temperature during the target/fusion binding period. Following binding selection, those library members that stay bound to the immobilized target are PCR amplified. The PCR amplification step will enrich the population from the mRNA-display library that has higher affinity for the immobilized target. Error-prone PCR can also be done in between each round of selection to further increase the diversity of the mRNA-display library and reduce background in selection. A less time- consuming protocol for mRNA display was recently published. ==Advantages== Although there are many other molecular display technologies, such as phage display, bacterial display, yeast display, and ribosome display, mRNA display technology has many advantages over the others. The first three biological display libraries listed have polypeptides or proteins expressed on the respective microorganism’s surface and the accompanying coding information for each polypeptide or protein is retrievable from the microorganism’s genome. However, the library size for these three in vivo display systems is limited by the transformation efficiency of each organism. For example, the library size for phage and bacterial display is limited to 1-10 × 10^9 different members. The library size for yeast display is even smaller. Moreover, these cell-based display system only allow the screening and enrichment of peptides/proteins containing natural amino acids. In contrast, mRNA display and ribosome display are in vitro selection methods. They allow a library size as large as 10^15 different members. The large library size increases the probability to select very rare sequences, and also improves the diversity of the selected sequences. In addition, in vitro selection methods remove unwanted selection pressure, such as poor protein expression, and rapid protein degradation, which may reduce the diversity of the selected sequences. Finally, in vitro selection methods allow the application of in vitro mutagenesis and recombination techniques throughout the selection process. Although both ribosome display and mRNA display are in vitro selection methods, mRNA display has some advantage over the ribosome display technology. mRNA display utilizes covalent mRNA-polypeptide complexes linked through puromycin; whereas, ribosome display utilizes stalled, noncovalent ribosome- mRNA-polypeptide complexes. For ribosome display, selection stringency is limited to keep ribosome-mRNA-polypeptide in a complex because of the noncovalent ribosome-mRNA-polypeptide complexes. This may cause difficulties in reducing background binding during the selection cycle. Also, the polypeptides under selection in a ribosome display system are attached to an enormous rRNA-protein complex, a ribosome, which has a molecular weight of more than 2,000,000 Da. There might be some unpredictable interaction between the selection target and the ribosome, and this may lead to a loss of potential binders during the selection cycle. In contrast, the puromycin DNA spacer linker used in mRNA display technology is much smaller comparing to a ribosome. This linker may have less chance to interact with an immobilized selection target. Thus, mRNA display technology is more likely to give less biased results. ==Application== In 1997, Roberts and Szostak showed that fusions between a synthetic mRNA and its encoded myc epitope could be enriched from a pool of random sequence mRNA-polypeptide fusions by immunoprecipitation. Nine years later, Fukuda and colleagues chose mRNA display method for in vitro evolution of single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments. They selected six different scFv mutants with five consensus mutations. However, kinetic analysis of these mutants showed that their antigen-specificity remained similar to that of the wild type. However, they have demonstrated that two of the five consensus mutations were within the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). And they concluded that mRNA display has the potential for rapid artificial evolution of high-affinity diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies by optimizing their CDRs. Roberts and coworkers have demonstrated that unnatural peptide oligomers consisting of an N-substituted amino acid can be synthesized as mRNA-polypeptide fusions. N-substituted amino acid-containing peptides have been associated with good proteolytic stability and improved pharmacokinetic properties. This work indicates that mRNA display technology has the potential for selecting drug- like peptides for therapeutic usage resistant to proteolysis. ==See also== *Ribosome display *Protein engineering *Protein–protein interaction screening ==References== Category:Molecular biology ","title":"MRNA display"},{"id":"7792495","text":"Solomon ben Joshua Adeni (Hebrew: שלמה בן יהושע) or Shelomo bar Joshua Adeni (1567–1625Encyclopedia Judaica: \\"Solomon Adeni (1567-1625)\\") was a Yemenite Jewish author and Talmudist, who lived during the second half of the 16th century at Sana'a and Aden in southern Arabia, from which town he received the name \\"Adeni\\" or \\"the Adenite.\\" In 1571, Solomon Adeni immigrated with his family to Ottoman Palestine.Introduction to the Mishnah Commentary, Melekhet Shlomo.

He is buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Hebron. ==Family background== The only thing known of Adeni's family is what he wrote about them in his Introduction to his Mishnah commentary: \\"We have also received it as an oral tradition that we are of the party to whom sent Ezra the scribe, requesting them to come up to the land during the building of the Second Temple, and they rebelled and he cursed them, saying that all their days in exile will be spent in poverty. And because of our iniquities, there was fulfilled in us in that Exile, both, poverty in the Law, and poverty in material wealth in a most superlative manner, and especially with my small family! For all of them, according to what was told to me and, indeed, confirmed with me by the tellers of the truth who spoke clearly, were God fearing people, and those who had acquired an accurate knowledge of the Law (Torah), even the disciples of my lord, my father, of blessed memory (for he was the Rabbi of the city Uzal which is called Sana'a). Also before this, my grandfather, the father of my father, was a teacher of small children there.

They perform típico, a form of traditional Panamanian music and Panamanian- style cumbia. They have been praised as patrónes de la cumbia (\\"masters of cumbia\\"),http://www.latinol.com/diversion/artistas/bdefault.asp and are very popular in Panama. ==Early lives and career== Samy was born on 15 February 1968, and Sandra was born on 10 April 1970, to Luis and Dolores Sandoval in Chitré, in the Herrera Province of Panama. At age eight, Samy began to play the accordion, and after listening to songs at home, Sandra began singing. When Samy was eleven and Sandra nine, the two began performing on stage in their native Herrera Province. They slowly gained popularity through performances in other provinces, such as Coclé, Chiriquí, Veraguas, and Los Santos. By age eleven, Samy had entered and won a number of music and talent contests, though the limited number of fans of típico music in turn limited the duo's popularity. They then made several appearances on Panamanian television networks, such as RTVE and Channel 11, in order to reach a larger audience. At ages fifteen and thirteen, Samy and Sandra began to travel with their band, Ritmo Montañero (\\"Mountaineer Rhythm\\"). They became popular with young, middle-class audiences, and their popularity began to surpass that of many other típico stars. Samy and Sandra Sandoval are often credited as having been the first to expose the general public to típico, pindín, and other Panamanian folk musical styles. Their rise in popularity was attributed to Sandra's voice, dance ability, and enthusiasm, as well as Samy's skill at playing the accordion. ==Musical hits== Sandra Sandoval performing in 2012 The Sandovals' successful songs include \\"Brindemos por lo nuestro\\" (\\"Toast to Ourselves\\"), \\"La mujer superficial\\" (\\"Superficial Woman\\"), \\"Oiga el viejo pá jodé,\\" and \\"Lo que no da se deja\\" (\\"What is ungiving ought to be abandoned\\"). In 1994, at the Encuentro de Accordeones (\\"Meeting of Accordions\\") festival they became popular with the song \\"La gallina fina\\" (\\"The Fine Hen\\"), which they also performed on the soundtrack for the 2001 movie The Tailor of Panama. They have released a total of fifteen albums, sold more than 30,000 records, and have had a platinum album. They have recorded a duet with Gilberto Santa Rosa, who considered them some of the best performers of tipíca. ==Other works== The Sandovals' life stories have been the topic of television shows such as Los compadres, Aires de mi tierra, Hecho en Panamá, and De Mujeres. They also had a small regular role in the television comedy series Los Vergaras. Recently, they have appeared on Univision's Sábado Gigante, and in El Festival de la Calle 8. A quote by Sandra, \\"No hay mujer fea, sino mujer sin plata\\" (\\"There are no ugly women, only women without money\\"), is now a popular phrase amongst many Panamanians. Samy and Sandra frequently appear at Las Fiestas del Rey Momo. They have performed throughout the United States, the Dominican Republic, and given concerts in Belgium and the Netherlands, performing to audiences of more than 70,000. They have also performed for the Monegasque royalty. They were the subject of biography, Samy and Sandra: The Story, written by Sergio Pérez Saavedra, and a DVD by the same title. It was well received by fans. ==Personal lives== Both Samy and Sandra have completed formal education. Samy has a degree in civil engineering; he met his wife Iraida at university. After dating for five years they married on the 14 February 1994. They have two sons, aged twelve and eight. Sandra completed a degree in law and practised as an attorney intermittently. She later decided to devote her time entirely to entertaining and her family. In February 2008, Sandra gave birth to her first child, a boy, whom she named Luis Esteban. ==References== ==External links== *Samy and Sandra Sandoval on Myspace Category:1968 births Category:1970 births Category:Panamanian women lawyers Category:Panamanian lawyers Category:Panamanian musical groups Category:People from Chitré Category:Sibling musical duos Category:Living people ","title":"Samy and Sandra Sandoval"},{"id":"7792500","text":"Gulf of Alexandretta (İskenderun) in Hatay Province, on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, near the border with Syria The Gulf of Alexandretta or İskenderun () is a gulf of the eastern Mediterranean or Levantine Sea.

It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the Moon, a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final E-6 spacecraft, Luna 9.

A connecting rod in the Blok I stage broke, leading to a propellant valve failing to open completely. The stage developed insufficient thrust to reach orbit and it shut down at T+489 seconds. The upper stages and probe reentered the atmosphere and broke up. Prior to the release of information about its mission, NASA correctly identified that it had been an attempt to land a spacecraft on the Moon. ==References== ==External links== * Zarya - Luna programme chronology Category:Luna program Category:Spacecraft launched in 1964 Category:Spacecraft launched by Molniya-M rockets ","title":"Luna E-6 No.6"},{"id":"7792586","text":"A WAP gateway sits between mobile devices using the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and the World Wide Web, passing pages from one to the other much like a proxy.

It was filmed on location in and around the Serez family farm in Mulmur, Ontario, as well as Wisconsin (train sequences) and establishing shots in Pittsburgh. The jail sequences were filmed in both the Allegheny County Courthouse and old Allegheny County Jail. The film was entered in the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. ==Plot== Kate Soffel is the wife of a Pittsburgh prison warden in 1901. They have four children. After several months of being sick in bed for no discernible reason, she suddenly regains her strength. She visits inmates to read Bible scripture to them and meets Ed Biddle and his brother Jack, both of whom may be innocent of the crimes that brought them there. Mrs. Soffel falls in love with Ed and enables him and Jack to escape, smuggling bar-cutting blades to him at the prison.

An original author of the Amazigh Manifesto, he was later appointed as the first Rector of the Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture. He has worked extensively on incorporating Amazigh culture into Moroccan identity and is a leading intellectual of the Moroccan intelligentsia. ==Early life and education== Mohamed Chafik was born in the small village of Béni Ait Sadden, located in the Middle Atlas mountains. He was raised in a devout Muslim household by his wealthy agricultural family. At the age of 8 he began his French language education. He would later describe this as \\"The third of my socio-cultural dimensions: my marocanity\\", referring to the addition of French to his language repertoire, which previously consisted of Arabic and Amazigh. Chafik then enrolled at the elite collège d'Azrou. There he was taught by My Ahmed Zemmouri, who was a proponent of Moroccan independence from France. He finished his secondary education at the lycée Moulay Youssef, now infamous for its temporary closure due to student protests that erupted in 1944. During the political tensions surrounding Moroccan independence, Chafik avoided conscription, unlike many of his other graduating classmates from the collège d'Azrou. Despite interruptions of his education due to political strife, he would go on to receive degrees in Arabic, Amazigh, history, and pedagogy. ==Professional work and Amazigh activism== ===Early work=== Before committing to the revival and re-appreciation of Amazigh culture, Chafik held a number of other positions that would prove to be helpful to him in the future. He began his career as a teacher in the mid 1950s. In particular, he worked to educate girls of rural areas, as they traditionally had limited access to education. In 1955 he was appointed Inspector of Primary Education. From the 1960s into the 1970s, he was promoted through the ranks of Moroccan civil service. In 1963 he was promoted from Inspector of Primary Education to First Inspector of National Education. In 1970 he was named Secretary of Education in the royal cabinet and in 1972 he became Secretary of State to the Prime Minister. From 1973 to 1976 was again an adviser to the Royal Court after which he was appointed director of the Collège Royal. There he taught the current king of Morocco, Mohammed VI. During his time in these posts he advocated for strong multilingual education, but gained little traction in the face of hegemonic French. During this time as well, he wrote extensively about the central place that the Amazigh peoples occupy in Moroccan and African culture. He stressed the importance of using an intersectional lens to look at the ethnic and linguistic complexities of Morocco. In this vein, he is noted for reconciling the views of Arab-nationalists and Islamists. Abdesslam Yassine, a staunch Islamist with whom he frequently disagreed, was a colleague he worked with in the Ministry of Education. Yassine used the argument that Islamic-Arab identity of Morocco is tied intrinsically to qu'ranic Arabic and therefore argued against the introduction of Amazigh to Morocco's education system. Chafik pointed out that Morocco is not a purely Arab nation and nor is Islam solely compatible with Arab identity. Without rejecting Islam or Arabic, Chafik retorted that there was no justification for the suppression of Amazigh language in the Quran, citing the verse that reads \\"the Arab is no better than the foreigner, nor the foreigner than the Arab but in piety.\\" In 1980 Chafik co-founded l’Association culturelle amazighe (the Amazigh Culture Association). This was the first of its kind to use the preferred term 'Amazigh' instead of the exonym 'Berber'. Chafik advocated for this terminological change to reflect the Amazigh people's self-identification. The word 'Berber' comes from Latin for barbarian, which in itself is pejorative, while 'Amazigh' literally translates to 'the free people'. Unfortunately, the Association was short lived. In 1982 the association's leader, Sidqi Azayko, was arrested and imprisoned for a year. This prompted Chafik and his colleagues to suspend the association. This did not deter the activists and Chafik continued to advocate by writing essays and extensive lobbying. In the same year that he co-founded the Association he was also appointed to a position at l'Académie du Royaume du Maroc (Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco). ===The Manifesto and IRCAM=== The year 2000 was the most significant year for the Amazigh cultural movement. It was in this year that Chafik wrote and presented 'Un manifeste pour la reconnaissance officielle de l’amazighité du Maroc', more commonly known as the Amazigh Manifesto. It was in this manifesto that he laid out a nine-point argument for the promotion of Amazigh language and culture and demanded official recognition from the Moroccan Government. The manifesto was signed by over two hundred other activists, writers, and Amazigh artists. The manifesto proved to be influential, as on 17 October 2001, not even one year later after its publication, King Mohammed VI established by dahir the Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture (IRCAM). Chafik would later be named the first rector of the institute. However, he declined a salary to prove his complete dedication to the cause. One of the first issues addressed by the institute was the standardization of the Amazigh orthography. There was little consensus on how to approach a standard orthography, as many Arab-nationalists lobbied for the use of Arabic script. Chafik and many other Amazigh scholars identified this as problematic, as it would further a hierarchy among the languages. Chafik argued for creating and standardizing an Amazigh script while seeking comprise in its implementation. He offered that schools should teach this script along with the Latin alphabet for French and the Arabic adjad for Arabic. While controversy still surrounds the teaching of Amazigh in schools, another dahir of Mohammed VI officially recognized the Tifinagh script, an important victory for the Amazigh cause. Even with the establishment of IRCAM, many leaders within the institute continued to disagree. Many of the more militant Amazigh scholars felt that government oversight of the institute would lead to the manipulation and perversion of their vision of promoting Amazigh culture. The officials more closely allied with the Moroccan government argued that the chances to accomplish any goals would drastically diminish without government funding and supervision. Chafik fell somewhere in the middle of these two camps. Having worked with both groups at one time or another, he frequently sought compromise. However, in February 2005 controversy struck when seven leading officials resigned. They claimed that IRCAM was serving the agenda of the government and Palace more than that of the Amazigh community. Ultimately, Chafik sided with the government but was sympathetic to their grievances. === Retirement === In November 2003 Chafik retired from his post as director of IRCAM. He chose his colleague Ahmed Boukouss to fill the vacancy. During the 2000s he spent little time in the public eye except to give occasional interviews. However, he reappeared again in 2011 to co-author and sign an open letter to the Moroccan government concerning the constitutional referendum of July that year. While elevating the Amazigh language to official status was in the referendum draft, the letter clearly outlined the expectations of the government in recognizing Amazigh as an official national language. Chafik was the first to sign the letter and the government did in fact clarify the provision for Amazigh's official status. Chafik still holds his position as a member of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco. ==Awards and honor== In 1972 the Ordre des Palmes Académiques bestowed Chafik with the title of chevalier for his work as a francophone intellectual. In 2002 the Prince Claus FundPrince Claus Fund for Culture and Development awarded Chafik the Principal Award (Laureate) for his academic achievements, specifically due to the large Amazigh population in The Netherlands. In 2014, during the 15th Throne Celebration of Mohammed VI, the king honored Chafik with a royal wissam with the distinction of Al Kafaa Al Fikria for intellectual merit. In 2018, on April 26, Chafik was honored with the Prix de la Fondation de l'Académie du Royaume du Maroc at the closing of their 45 session. The honor paid homage to Chafik's life accomplishments and contributions to the Moroccan cultural landscape. ==Major works== * Pensées sous-développées (Underdeveloped Thoughts), 1972, Librairie-papeterie des écoles, Rabat. * Ce que dit le muezzin (That which the Muezzin says), 1974, Librairie-papeterie des écoles, Rabat. * Aperçu sur trente-trois siècles d’histoire des Amazighs (A glimpse of thirty-three centuries of Amazigh history) , 1989, Alkalam, Mohammedia. * Dictionnaire bilingue : arabe-amazigh (Arabic-Amazigh Bilingual Dictionary), tome 1 (1990), tome 2 (1996), tome 3 (1999), Publications de l’Académie marocaine. * Quarante-quatre leçons en langue amazighe (Forty Four lessons in Amazigh), 1991, Édition arabo-africaine, Rabat. * Le dialecte marocain : un domaine de contacte entre l’amazigh et l’arabe (The Moroccan dialect: a field of confluence between Amazigh and Arabic Languages), 1999, publication de l’Académie marocaine, Rabat. * La langue tamazight et sa structure linguistique (The Amazigh language and its linguistic structure), 2000, Le Fennec, Rabat. * Pour un Maghreb d’abord maghrébin (For a Maghreb that is first maghrebian), 2000, Centre Tarik Ibn Zyad, Rabat. ==See also== *Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture *Berber orthography ==References== ==External links== *Interview with Mohamed Chafik in TelQuel-Online by Driss Ksikes (in French): \\"L'Islam prône la Laïcité\\" Category:1926 births Category:Berber activists Category:Berber grammarians Category:Berber Moroccans Category:Berber scholars Category:Berber writers Category:Chevaliers of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques Category:Living people Category:Moroccan lexicographers Category:Linguists from Morocco Category:Moroccan writers Category:People from Fez, Morocco ","title":"Mohamed Chafik"},{"id":"7792734","text":"WDSL can refer to: * Wireless Digital subscriber line * WDSL (AM), an AM radio station located in Mocksville, North Carolina Not to be confused with WSDL (Web Services Description Language).

It lies on the right (south) bank of the Danube and is the administrative centre of a municipality with the same name. As of December 2017 Novo Selo has a population of 970 and the mayor is Georgi Stoenelov. It lies at , 45 m above sea level. The village is located 25 km north-northwest of the provincial centre Vidin and 12 km east of the Serbian border at the Timok River mouth, with Mehedinţi County of Romania directly across the Danube to the north. The main occupation in Novo Selo is vine growing. According to the travel notes of the Italian traveller Count Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli, the village was founded around 1700 and was initially named Prosǎnǎc (Просънъц). Due to the plague and a fire the villagers abandoned the village only for their descendants to return in 1772 to found the modern Novo Selo. After the Crimean War a local government was set up and a knez (mayor) and councillors were elected. Following the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 Novo Selo became part of Vidin District, and has since 1 January 1979 been the seat of a municipality also including the villages of Florentin, Negovanovtsi, Vinarovo and Yasen. The construction of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church of St Nicholas in the village, a cultural monument, began in 1825, during the Ottoman era. The bells were shipped from Pest, Austria-Hungary. The Zemedelets chitalishte (community centre) was built in 1930; it is also a memorial to all locals who perished in the wars. The Cyril and Methodius School dates to 1939. Another landmark is the characteristic clock tower from 1931, which is a symbol of Novo Selo. Novo Selo also has a small river port, a beach and an orphanage. Novo Selo is also known for its typical vernacular, sharing features with the Serbian dialects to the west and the Torlakian vernacular to the south, as well as showing lexical influences from Vlach. Novo Selo's motto, in the local vernacular, is Mi smo si mi (Ми смо си ми), \\"We are (just) ourselves\\". ==Population== As of December 2017 Novo Selo has a population of 970 people, down from its peak of 4,535 people in 1934. Most inhabitants are ethnic Bulgarians (93%), with a large Vlach minority (who declared themselves as Bulgarians) and a few Romani people (7%). An overwhelming majority of the population of the village identify themselves as Christians (95%). Most inhabitants identified as Orthodox Christians belonging to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

The definition mostly appears in proof theory (of classical logic), e.g. in conjunctive normal form and the method of resolution. Literals can be divided into two types: * A positive literal is just an atom (e.g., x). * A negative literal is the negation of an atom (e.g., \\\\lnot x). The polarity of a literal is positive or negative depending on whether it is a positive or negative literal. For a literal l, the complementary literal is a literal corresponding to the negation of l, we can write \\\\bar{l} to denote the complementary literal of l. More precisely, if l\\\\equiv x then \\\\bar{l} is \\\\lnot x and if l\\\\equiv \\\\lnot x then \\\\bar{l} is x. In the context of a formula in the conjunctive normal form, a literal is pure if the literal's complement does not appear in the formula. In Boolean functions, each separate occurrence of a variable, either in inverse or uncomplemented form, is a literal. For example, if A, B and Care variables then the expression \\\\bar{A}BC contains three literals and the expression \\\\bar{A}C+\\\\bar{B}\\\\bar{C} contains four literals. However, the expression \\\\bar{A}C+\\\\bar{B}C would also be said to contain four literals, because although two of the literals are identical (C appears twice) these qualify as two separate occurrences. == Examples == In propositional calculus a literal is simply a propositional variable or its negation. In predicate calculus a literal is an atomic formula or its negation, where an atomic formula is a predicate symbol applied to some terms, P(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n) with the terms recursively defined starting from constant symbols, variable symbols, and function symbols. For example, eg Q(f(g(x), y, 2), x) is a negative literal with the constant symbol 2, the variable symbols x, y, the function symbols f, g, and the predicate symbol Q. ==References== * Category:Mathematical logic Category:Propositional calculus Category:Logic symbols ","title":"Literal (mathematical logic)"},{"id":"7792764","text":"Paul F.

Home Room is a 133-minute feature debut and was released on September 5, 2003. The film is about two teenagers dealing with a post-Columbine experience. Home Room focuses more on the physiological side of events throughout the film. The two teenage girls in the movie, Deanna (Erika Christensen) and Alicia (Busy Philipps), are troubled after the high school massacre. Deanna, described by Holden as “perky and so habitually upbeat,” suffers a head injury from the shooting, and Alicia, “dresses like a punk goth,” is ordered by the principal (James Pickens Jr.) to visit Deanna in the hospital. While that happens, police detectives investigate whether Alicia was involved in the shooting, due to claims of her standing next to the shooters before attacking. The film explores the depth of both teenage girls and focuses on the friendship they develop throughout the movie. The movie received mixed reviews from critics. Steven Holden, film and music critic for the New York Times, said that the film is “sluggishly paced and refuses to lighten up for even a second,” but continued to state that “as the police story plods along, it eventually seems like a structural contrivance. You come away from the movie not only caring about both girls, but believing that the bond they develop is genuine.” LA Times Staff Writer, Kevin Crust, stated, “With an unconscionably long running time of 2 hours and 11 minutes for what is essentially a two-hander between Philipps and Christensen, 'Home Room' feels like detention—without the possibility of recess.” === Films === * Home Room * Eye of the Storm * The List == Personal life == Ryan worked in a handful of award-winning independent films.

The outcome was a Bulgarian victoryClifford Rogers, 2010, p.288 ==Historical background== In 1328, the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium, Michael Asen III and Andronikos III Palaiologos, signed a secret treaty against Serbia. While Michael Asen III was fighting against the Serbs in 1330, the Byzantines invaded Thrace and captured its Bulgarian towns. ==Prelude== The Byzantines were unprepared for war. Their Empire was torn by civil unrest and the army was fighting against the Turks in Asia Minor. In the Bulgarian Empire, there were internecine struggles as well but the new Emperor Ivan Alexander knew that the decisive confrontation with Byzantium was yet to come and decided to improve his relations with the Serbs. In 1332, he concluded a peace treaty with them which lasted till his death. The treaty was secured with a marriage between the Serb king Stefan Dushan and the sister of the Emperor, Elena. In the summer of the same year, the Byzantines gathered an army and without a declaration of war advanced towards Bulgaria, looting and plundering the villages on their way. The Byzantines seized several castles because Ivan Alexander's attention was focused towards fighting the rebellion of his uncle Belaur in Vidin. He tried to negotiate with the enemy without success. The Emperor decided to act swiftly during the course of five days, when his cavalry covered 230 km to reach Aitos and face the invaders. ==The battle== Ivan Alexander had troops of 8,000 while the Byzantines were only 3,000. There were negotiations between the two rulers but the Bulgarian emperor deliberately prolonged them because he was awaiting reinforcements. In the night of July 17 they finally arrived in his camp (3,000 cavalrymen) and he decided to attack the Byzantines the next day. Andronikos III Palaiologos had no choice but to accept the fight.John Kantakouzenos, Historia. GIBI, vol. Х, p. 270. The Byzantine army consisted of 16 squads and six of them made up the first column. The right wing was commanded by the protostrator, the left wing was under the megas papias Alexios Tzamplakon, and the center was commanded personally by the emperor. The army formed a wide front in two lines with the flanks positioned behind the center forming a crescent. The battle began at six in the morning and continued for three hours. The Byzantines tried to prevent the Bulgarian cavalry from surrounding them, but their manoeuvre failed. The cavalry moved around the first Byzantine line, leaving it for the infantry and charged the rear of their flanks. After a fierce fight the Byzantines were defeated, abandoned the battlefield and took refuge in Rusokastro. The Bulgarian army surrounded the fortress and at noon on the same day Ivan Alexander sent envoys to continue the negotiations.John Kantakouzenos, Historia. GIBI, vol. Х, p. 272. ==Aftermath== Monument of the Battle of Rusokastro. The Bulgarians recovered their lost territory in Thrace and strengthened the position of their empire. The eight-year-old son and successor of the Bulgarian emperor Michael Asen was married to the daughter of Andronikos, Maria, cementing the peace between the two states. This battle was regarded by medieval Bulgarian historians as a great triumph of emperor Ivan Alexander. That was the last major battle between Bulgaria and Byzantium as their seven-century rivalry for domination of the Balkans was soon to come to an end, after the fall of the two Empires under Ottoman domination.

The symphony is in three integrated movements; a typical performance lasts around 30 minutes. The symphony opens with a trumpet motto, forcefully stated, and shadowed by timpani; this is eventually woven into a theme for strings, over which woodwinds begin a climb. The second theme of the movement is more austere, yet is still exuberant. The second movement is more lyrical in nature, and is structured around two main themes; of these, the first is stated initially by the strings, while the second is first taken up by the woodwinds. The third and final movement is built on four themes, derived from what Lilburn once called \\"the naive, generous country that gave one its joyous force\\".

The design was similar to the future successful Luna 10 spacecraft. Kosmos 111 was produced in less than a month, one of two spacecraft developed from the E-6 lander bus in a crash program to upstage America's Lunar Orbiter series and to commemorate the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), held in March 1966. ==Spacecraft== Kosmos 111 was designated an E-6S spacecraft, consisting of an E-6 bus attached to a cylindrical pressurized 245 kg lunar orbiter module. It was tall and in diameter at the base. The main propulsion systems for lunar orbit insertion were on the bus, and the science payload was carried on the orbiter module. The payload comprised seven instruments: a gamma-ray spectrometer for energies between 0.3–3 MeV, a triaxial magnetometer (on the end of a 1.5-meter boom), a piezoelectric micrometeoroid detector, instruments for solar-plasma studies, devices for measuring infrared emissions from the Moon, low energy X-ray detectors, and a bank of charged particle detectors. Additionally, the radio system can be used for gravitational and radio occultation studies. The lunar orbiting module was battery-powered and communications were via 183 MHz and 922 MHz aerials. ==Scientific instruments== Seven scientific instruments: * Magnetometer * Gamma-ray spectrometer * Five gas-discharge counters * Two ion traps and a charged particle trap * Piezoelectric micrometer detector * Infrared detector * Low- energy X-ray photon counters ==Mission== This mission was intended to orbit the Moon and was configured identically to the future Luna 10 mission (1966-027A). It was launched on 1 March 1966 at 11:03:49 GMT via Molniya 8K78M s/n U15000-50 rocket from Site 31/6 into Earth parking orbit, but the Blok-L upper stage lost roll control and failed to fire the spacecraft into a lunar trajectory. It had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.9°, and an orbital period of 88.6 minutes. It was designated Kosmos 111 and reentered two days after launch, on 3 March 1966. The craft weighed and was not immediately acknowledged to be a Luna vehicle after its destruction.

Gair (January 15, 1894 - February 10, 1975) was in his time the United States most prominent trial lawyer in the field of negligence, or accident law, and unequalled as a court room nemesis to opposing medical witnesses.The Lawyer Who Hasn't Lost A Case In Ten Years by Will Chassan, Pageant Magazine, vol. 9, No 11, May 1954 He was the founder of the firm of Harry A. Gair later known as the firm of Gair & Gair and with the addition of Robert L. Conason the firm of Gair, Gair & Conason. The firm continues to this day as Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf. ==Personal== Gair was married to Harriet E. Gair (c. 1906 - 2006), who became a partner in his firm in 1945. Their son Anthony H. Gair, a graduate of Thomas M. Cooley Law School, is now a partner with the firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf, having practiced there for over 30 years. Among his children is the well known psychiatrist Dr. Donald S. Gair, a graduate of Harvard Medical School. His daughter Barbara Scheiber claimed in 2014 that her father and stepmother were the subjects of the 1928 Walker Evans photograph Couple at Coney Island, New York. Gair was admitted to the bar of New York in 1919. He was a lecturer on Medical-Legal Jurisprudence, at Columbia University Law School, at New York University Law School and Vanderbilt University. He was a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and a member of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers where he served as Dean from 1956 to 1957 and as Director from 1954 to 1955. He was also a member of the Law-Science Academy of America where he served as President from 1953 to 1955. ==Advocacy== Gair's reputation was such that one large insurance company made it a policy to settle all cases with him out of court on the theory that trying to beat him was impossible. In one three-year period, he tried over 150 cases before the New York State Supreme Court and won all of them. Gair never attended college or law school and his formal education ended in the eighth grade. A native of New York City, he was born to Hyman and Minnie Gair on January 15, 1894 and was self-taught through law office study and through private reading of the law. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York retained Gair as a member of two important committees: those on the Judiciary and Professional Ethics. He fulfilled those functions in addition to other professional endeavors, such as the Presidencies of four Bar Associations, including the International Academy of Trial Lawyers. Gair was a pioneer in the field of aviation crash litigation,Lawsuit by Stuart M. Speiser, Horizon Press, 1980New York Journal - American, October 26th 1961, March 21st 1963New York - Telegram, January 30th 1964 handling such cases as the American Airlines crash in the East River on February 3, 1959. Among the numerous other airline crash cases he handled, was the case of Jane Froman and Gypsy Lee Markoff against Pan American lines. Following the trial, the trial Judge, Aron Steuer, the son of trial lawyer Max Steuer, wrote Gair the following on March 18, 1953: :My Dear Mr. Gair, :In the course of over twenty-three years on the bench I have had occasion to listen to some thousands of summations. I have never heard one which was the equal of your effort made yesterday, March 17, 1953, in the action of Froman and Markoff against Pan American Lines. For cogency of argument, selection of material form the record, manner of presentation and delivery, in fact from every standpoint it was masterly. Do not infer from this that I find that any part of the presentation of the case was less than what it ought have been, but only that the summation was so outstanding that I cannot forbear declaring my admiration. Gair was a plaintiffs' lawyer primarily. His clients included victims of derailed trains, plane wrecks, collapsed buildings, exploded cans and many other types of unplanned disaster. Most of the more notable mishaps of his time brought clients into his office. In tribute to him following his death in 1975, his partner, Herman Schmertz, quoted the following from one of his summations \\"He is gone. The spirit of justice which was so much a part of him and animated all his judgment - that survives. So long as we cherish that spirit, it will always keep his memory green.\\" Gair had delivered these lines to a jury in the course of a summation in a lawsuit emanating from the death of a husband and father.The Institute of Jewish Humanities, Testimonial Dinner, March 14th 1982 ==References== ==Selected writings== *The trial of a Negligence Action, Practicing Law Institute, May 1953 ed., May 1956 rev. print edition *Negligence Cases - Winning Strategy, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1957 *The Preparation and Trial of Aviation Litigation, American College of Trial Lawyers, 1957 *Damages for Fear and Mental Pain, Boston University Law Review, vol.

She was built by the American Ship Building Company in Lorain, Ohio and launched on 18 March 1967. She commissioned on 19 April 1968. She was decommissioned 19 September 2001. ==Initial deployment== The Courageous was built at the American Shipyards in Lorain, Ohio and launched on 18 March 1967. She was delivered to the Coast Guard and commissioned on 19 April 1968. She was initially homeported in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and served there through 1972, conducting search and rescue and law enforcement patrols. On 10 September 1968 she towed the disabled sailboat Ibex 20 miles north of Bimini to Miami. On 6 October 1968 she medevaced a boy suffering from the bends from the F/V M.M. Winter off the coast of Florida. On 21 April 1969 crewmen boarded the German M/V Helga Witt following a request by the ship's commanding officer concerning armed men on board. The Courageous then escorted the German merchantman to San Juan. On 29 through 30 April 1969 she assumed duty of on-scene commander following a fire on the British tanker Mobile Apex, taking the blazing tanker in tow and took her out of Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The cutter and crew were awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation \\"for exceptionally meritorious service during the period 29 April to 2 May 1969\\" for this action. From 11 to 28 July Courageous participated in BOMAX (Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment), hosting Coast Guard cadets and scientists. The crew assisted scientists with assembling and launching devices for measuring ocean currents and temperatures. An article on this assignment was published in the August 1969 issue of Popular Science. On 7 August 1969 stood by the M/V Pionyr following its grounding until a commercial tug arrived on scene. On the 30th, Courageous assisted in a medevac from a sailboat 320 miles north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 12 October 1970 the cutter once again assisted in a medevac and then towed the F/V Janice Elaine to Miami. On 1 August 1971 Courageous seized the yacht White Cloud near Cuban waters and arrested two for aiding draft evaders. On 23 December 1971 RCC Miami notified Courageous to undertake a rescue of the 26-foot S/V Ian's Cradle with 4 persons on board, during a severe gale, east of Fort Pierce. The sailing vessel and her crew had attempted to sail to Bimini in other than optimum weather conditions. By the time the request for assistance was broadcast, Ian's Cradle had been dismasted and had lost one person overboard and the remaining three, including an infant, were in mortal danger. The Courageous got underway and located the sailing vessel and after much trouble managed to secure a towline. Due to the worsening of the sea conditions, a helo was requested out of St. Petersburg, and the three survivors on Ian's Cradle were lifted off their vessel to safety. The Ian's Cradle sank ten minutes later. During this rescue, Courageous lost all of her helicopter nets, her long antenna, and sustained other damage.** ==The \\"drugs war\\"== She changed homeports in late 1971 to Cape Canaveral. Courageous sustained a casualty when an elevator in the galley collapsed and killed SS3 Dean Renolds in 1973. On 21 December 1977 Courageous seized the vessel Isla de Aruba carry illegal drugs, marking the beginning of her duties on the \\"front lines of the drug war.\\" On 18 March 1982 she seized the Cayman Island-flagged Damocles carrying 28 tons of marijuana. She changed homeports once again in 1982 to Key West. On 25 January 1984 she seized a work boat with 20 tons of marijuana on board. On 17 March 1984 Courageous seized another work boat with 20 tons of marijuana on board northwest of Providence Channel. On 20 March 1984 a boarding team seized the F/V Griffon 75 miles east of Great Abaco Island carrying 30 pounds of marijuana. On 6 May 1984 her boarding team seized the M/V Canta Dora 14 mile north of New Providence Island carrying 10 tons of marijuana and on 25 June 1984 seized M/V Henry I 100 miles north of Yucatán Channel carrying 8.5 tons of marijuana. They again seized a small fishing vessel with 5 tons of marijuana on board near Rum Cay and on 18 August 1984 they seized P/C Mayo near Rum Cay with 5 tons of marijuana on board. On the same day her team seized the P/C Miriam C 65 miles northeast of Nassau carrying 15 tons of marijuana. On 24 August 1984 her crew took a break from law enforcement and rescued 10 from the M/V Rio Teta, which the crew had scuttled to avoid being searched. Courageous began a new year by seizing the F/V Black Stallion 330 miles northwest of Puerto Rico carrying 10 tons of marijuana on 14 January 1985. ==Refit== In March 1987 she was decommissioned and entered Colonna's Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia for her Major Maintenance Availability process (MMA). She received the following modifications and upgrades: improved habitability, improved stability by rearranging tank locations, replacement of all asbestos paneling, increased the berthing space, upgraded the flight deck and helicopter equipment, increased the amount of helicopter fuel carried, improved the evaporator, increased and upgraded the communications and electronics capacities, installed vertical exhaust stacks and associated ballast, and installed a smoke detection system and new fire- fighting equipment. Courageous was returned to the Coast Guard on 5 March 1990 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The cutter was then placed in commission \\"special status.\\" Following an extensive onload of needed supplies, the crew completed a five-month engine overhaul in Portsmouth. During subsequent engine trials, a shaft alignment problem was discovered by the crew. A five-month drydocking at the Coast Guard Yard for shaft repairs was required. In addition to shaft repairs, a new steering motor was installed, both anchors were replaced, and a new computer system was installed in the cutter's combat information center. Having completed the repairs to the shaft alignment and undergoing extensive crew training and ready for sea preparations, Courageous arrived at her new homeport of Panama City, Florida, on 3 February 1991. She was formally recommissioned on 16 March 1991. ==Migrant interdiction== Courageous once again began performing her routine maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, and defense readiness patrols in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. One of her commanding officers described her duties as follows: On 8 September 2001, a Good Samaritan located a raft 25 miles south of Alligator Key, FL. Cutter arrived on scene and embarked nine Cuban migrants. The raft was destroyed as a hazard to navigation. The migrants were transferred to Courageous where Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) interviews were conducted. On 12 September, the nine migrants were transferred to the cutter and returned to Cuba. On 3 September, Coast Guard Station Marathon intercepted nine Cuban migrants, 10 miles south of Sombrero Key Light. All nine migrants were transferred to cutter ' for further transfer to cutter Courageous for INS interviews. On 9 September, the nine migrants were returned to Cuba by cutter Key Largo. On 3 September, a good Samaritan spotted two Cuban migrants on a raft, 30 miles south of Key West, FL. Cutter Padre embarked the migrants for further transfer to cutter Courageous for INS interviews. On 9 September, the two Cuban migrants were returned to Cuba by cutter . Additionally, on 3 September, cutter Courageous intercepted two Cuban migrants on a raft, 40 miles south of Marathon, Florida. Cutter Courageous embarked the migrants where INS interviews were conducted. One of the migrants was returned to Cuba on 9 September, the remaining migrant was transferred to cutter Nantucket and returned to Cuba on 12 September. On 3 September, an Air Station Miami HH-25 aircraft spotted a 25-foot vessel with approximately 28 Cuban migrants on board. Cutter Courageous intercepted the raft, 39 miles southeast of Marathon, FL. All 28 Cuban migrants were taken aboard cutter Courageous where INS interviews were conducted. The raft was destroyed as a hazard to navigation. On 9 September cutter Key Largo returned all 28 migrants to Cuba. On 5 September, cutter Courageous located a raft with six Cuban migrants, 10 miles north of Cay Sal Bank, Bahamas. On 7 September, the migrants were transferred to cutter and later transferred to Bahamian authorities in Freeport, Bahamas. On 5 September, cutter Courageous intercepted 19 Cuban migrants on a go-fast 11 miles north of Cay Sal Bank, Bahamas. Two of the migrants are suspected to be smugglers and were turned over to the U.S. Border Patrol. INS interviews were conducted on cutter Courageous. On 12 September, the migrants were transferred to cutter Nantucket and returned to Cuba. As of October 2001, a memo from the cutter noted that: Courageous experienced her most challenging migrant mission on September 5, when she stopped a 30-ft speedboat 50 miles south of the Florida Keys, with the assistance of a Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter. The Courageous boarding team discovered that the \\"go-fast\\" was smuggling migrants from Cuba to South Florida, and had 17 migrants secreted into a small locker in the bow of the speedboat. Most of the Cubans were unconscious and near death from dehydration, and the crew of the Courageous quickly recovered all seventeen onboard where the ship's medical technicians quickly stabilized the most critical migrants. After subsequent INS interviews, the migrants were repatriated to Cuba one week later. In addition to the migrant interdiction missions, Courageous was also the on-scene commander during the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission for a downed Cuban aircraft on September 19 and 20. The nine survivors, including three children, were rescued by the passing 580-foot Panamanian freighter Chios Dream. Courageous embarked a medical technician on the merchant vessel in heavy seas to perform emergency medical care; after the evacuation of the most critical survivor by helicopter, the remaining survivors were transferred ashore for medical treatment in Key West. The final two weeks of the deployment were spent at Naval Station, Mayport where the crew underwent an intense period of classroom training and practical underway exercises to hone their navigation, damage control, first aid, and seamanship skills.\\" She was decommissioned on 19 September 2001.Cutter History File.

She is currently serving the Sri Lankan Navy as P621 SLNS Samudura. The name means \\"sea\\" in Sinhalese.https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL31707.pdf ===Operations=== Samudura is tasked with deep sea patrolling both within the Sri Lankan territorial waters and in international waters to curb ongoing arms smuggling by the LTTE. In recent months Samudura, along with other OPVs of the Sri Lankan Navy, has been able to successfully intercept several ships smuggling arms for the LTTE. In all these cases the ships were sunk when they attacked the naval vessels with mortars. Samudura also participated in the Cadex 2009 military training exercises with the Indian Navy after the war. Samudura, in her post-conflict operations, continues to serve the nation with policing and law enforcement duties in the maritime jurisdiction of the country. Apart from her traditional role the ship successfully completed a scientific study programme in liaison with Geological & Mine Bureau of Sri Lanka in conjunction with Woods-hole Oceanographic Laboratory of USA. The ship celebrated her 7th anniversary in Trincomalee on 21 April 2012 with the participation of families of all her serving crew. The ship performed a major role in protecting the Sri Lankan waters from poaching in the northern waters by enforcing a strict vigil on the preservation of the marine environment and supporting sustainable fish- harvesting. At present the ship is attached to the Southern Naval Area to secure maritime interests in the Sri Lankan maritime jurisdiction. Her primary duties are to ensure the main Sea Lane of Communication (SLOC) that runs through the Sri Lankan maritime jurisdiction is safe for seafaring and policing the EEZ. The ship has intercepted several boat loads of illegal immigrants heading to Australia in violation of the country's immigration & emigration laws. In May 2020, it was deployed in the eastern Indian Ocean for search and rescue operations following the tropical cyclone Amfan. ====Commanders==== The First Sri Lankan Captain on the vessel was Captain Sirimevan Ranasinghe WWV RWP Subsequently, the ship has been Commanded by: * Captain Dimuthu Gunawardena RWP, psc * Captain Jayantha De Silva RSP, USP, psc * Captain Kapila Samaraweera RSP, USP * Captain Muditha Gamage Usp, psc * Captain YN Jayarathna RWP, RSP,USP, psc ==Gallery== File:SriLanka- Independence - 4 Feb 2019 (23).jpgSamudura near Colombo Harbour in 2019.

On June 12, 1994, under its current ownership, the Double Door hosted its first show, Lloyd Cole; the same week, the Smashing Pumpkins played under the name the Starchildren. The venue at 1572 N. Milwaukee Avenue had a capacity of 473 people. It was two levels with a stage, sound system, dance floor and bar on the main floor; the second was a mezzanine level, the most intimate area of the club with its lounge type setting. A second bar and dance floor, Door No. 3, was located downstairs in the basement. Notable artists who have played Double Door include local acts Emilie Autumn, The Smashing Pumpkins, American Cosmonaut, Local H, Chevelle, Veruca Salt, Wilco, Liz Phair, Liquid Soul, Rise Against, Cheap Trick, Andrew Bird and Chance The Rapper, as well as a number of national and international talents, including The Rolling Stones, The Killers, Of Monsters and Men, Cypress Hill, John Legend, Kings of Leon, Kanye West, Sonic Youth, Ray LaMontagne, Har Mar Superstar, Frenzal Rhomb and FIDLAR.

Scenes of the 2000 feature film High Fidelity were shot at Double Door. In 2005, the club was nearly shut down due to disagreements about its lease. The landlord, Brian Strauss, doubled the venue's rent. In 2013, Double Door's basement bar, formerly The Dirtroom, reopened as Door No. 3, with a renewed focus on up-and-coming DJs as well as special events, ranging from electro-swing and cabaret to roots reggae. After 22 years in Wicker Park, the Double Door began looking to relocate in the Logan Square neighborhood. In 2016, following further leasing disputes, the owners of the Double Door filed a proposal with the city of Chicago to allow them to begin restoring the historic Logan Square State and Savings Bank building located at 2551 N. Milwaukee Ave., about a mile from its original location. The Double Door closed due to eviction in 2017.

It was first described in 1886 when it was isolated from sour milk and named Bacillus oxytocus perniciosus (from Greek oxus 'sour' + -tokos 'producing'). Klebsiella oxytoca is characterized by negative methyl red, positive VP, positive citrate, urea and TSI gas production, is AA, and negative for TSI sulfide, DNAse, growth on sulfide-indole motility medium and the phenylalanine deaminase test. It is a diazotroph, able to colonise plant hosts and fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form which the plant can use. Association of K. oxytoca with the barley rhizosphere during an entire vegetative period has been demonstrated. The bacteria adhere strongly to root hairs, and less strongly to the surface of the zone of elongation and root cap mucilage. Like other enterobacteria, it is capable of acquiring antibiotic resistance, and isolates have been shown to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as well as carbapenemases. == Industrial uses == Klebsiella oxytoca has shown promise in industrial ethanol fuel production, and is referenced as being used to produce hydrogen in patents filed by Nanologix, Inc. ==Clinical significance and epidemiology.== Infections can result in colitis and sepsis. Outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca have occurred in multiple hospitals and ICUs throughout the world, and handwashing stations have been identified as a potentially important environmental reservoir. ==Ecology== Houseflies (Musca domestica) have a mutualistic relationship with the bacterium K. oxytoca. This bacterium can live on the surface of the housefly eggs and has a deterrent effect on the fungi growing in manure, thus benefiting the fly larvae which are competing with the fungi for nutrients. == References == ==External links== * *Type strain of Klebsiella oxytoca at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Enterobacteriaceae Category:Bacteria described in 1886 ","title":"Klebsiella oxytoca"},{"id":"7793215","text":"Konstantinos Spetsiotis (, 1883 – March 5, 1966) was a Greek track and field athlete who competed mainly in the 1500 metre walk.

He played 158 matches as a midfielder for Belgian club RSC Anderlecht, with whom he won three Belgian championships, as well as the 1983 UEFA Cup. He played 17 matches and scored one goal for the Danish national team, and represented his country at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and 1988 European Championship. ==Biography== Frimann started his career with Danish club Akademisk Boldklub (AB) under manager Christian Andersen. In 1980, Frimann made his senior debut for AB, who played in the top-flight Danish 1st Division. In 1981, Frimann moved to Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (KB). At KB, he was noticed by Belgian club Anderlecht, and he went to play for the club a season later. Frimann immediately got a place in the Anderlecht starting line-up, and he made his debut for the Danish national team in October 1983. Frimann remained seven seasons in Anderlecht, where he won three Belgian championships and the 1983 UEFA Cup. In his time at the club, he played alongside a number of fellow Danish national team players, most notably national team captain Morten Olsen. In 1988, after many injury problems at Anderlecht, the 26-year-old Frimann decided to return to Denmark. He was bought by Brøndby IF, and loaned out to Aarhus GF (AGF) in the 1988 season, where he won the 1988 Danish Cup. In 1989, he moved from AGF to Brøndby, where Morten Olsen was manager. In August 1990, Frimann ended his playing career, at 28 years of age, due to continued injury problems. He was the first player on Danish soil to have a testimonial match to his benefit, as the Danish 1986 World Cup team beat Brøndby IF 6–4. ===International career=== Selected for the Danish squad at the 1986 World Cup, Frimann looked like becoming an important part of the Danish team.Jeppe Facius, \\"Drenget direktør\\", Ekstra Bladet, 18 September 1999 A complicated ankle injury, sustained during the last training camp before the tournament, kept Frimann from playing at the 1986 World Cup, and for the rest of his career he would struggle with injuries.Jens-Carl Kristensen, \\"Per Frimann stopper som fodboldinvalid\\", Berlingske Tidende, 15 August 1990 Frimann was a part of the Danish team which qualified for the 1988 Summer Olympics, but the team never got to compete in the final tournament. It was discovered that Frimann was not eligible for the 2–0 win over Poland in which he played, and Denmark was penalised the points of the win. This cost the spot at the final tournament. He was a part of the Danish squad for the 1988 European Championship, where he took part in a single match. ===Retirement=== Following his retirement, he worked with public relations in the European Commission from 1992 to 1996. He was hired as an internal consulent in Danmarks Idrætsforbund in 1996. In April 1998, he became the sports director of former club AB. When AB manager Christian Andersen agreed a contract with league rivals F.C. Copenhagen in October 1998, eight months before his contract expiry in June 1999, Frimann initially refused to let Andersen go before time and suspended him.Mads Glenn Wehlast, \\"Benspænd\\", Ekstra Bladet, 27 October 1998 He soon changed his mind and let Andersen go,Lars Bøgeskov, \\"AB frigiver træner\\", Politiken, 30 October 1998 but the two would go on to have a strained relationship.

All of the company's products are vegan, and most are kosher-certified by the Kosher Services of America. Turtle Island Foods is also the first company in the United States to have their products approved by The Vegan Society in the United Kingdom. ==History== Headquartered in Hood River, Oregon, Turtle Island Foods began in 1980 in Forest Grove with intentions \\"to create delicious, nutritious, convenient and affordable vegetarian food.\\" It was founded by Seth Tibbott,Company History who began by producing tempeh for friends and family. Tibbot was inspired to create meat substitutes after having become a vegetarian in college. The company name is derived from a common legend found amongst the native people of North America. Once, when all of earth was underwater, a turtle offered its shell as a home for land animals, and that shell became North America. As a result, several Native American and First Nations refer to the continent as \\"Turtle Island.\\" With the help of family, Tibbot eventually expanded his company to what is now the second largest tempeh producer in the United States. Turtle Island Foods has no parent company. The famous Tofurky was only developed in 1995, and initially sold in local markets in Portland, Oregon. According to Tibbot, the first twenty years of the company had not been economically fruitful, and he built tree houses on a neighbor's property in Husum, Washington, which he rented out to tenants for additional income. During the Thanksgiving season of 1995, the company sold a total of 500 of their Tofurky roasts. In the early 2000s, the company began to grow considerably, shipping a record-breaking 201,108 of their Tofurky roasts in 2006, a 27% increase from the year prior. In 2008, Turtle Island became a sponsor of The Humane Society, the first food processor to do so in the society's history.

It was given its premiere the following year, and published by Faber Music (and co-published by Schirmer) around 1968.It was reprinted in 1976 by Price Milburn of Wellington, and again in 1997, by Wai-te-ata Music Press (also of Wellington) (as part of a substantial Lilburn edition, publishing many of his works, including his as yet unpublished works, and continuing posthumously). See for some information e.g. (Schirmer/Faber), (Milburn reprint), and for the 1997 reprint. The symphony was described by Lilburn as \\"a harsh, didactic personalised piece of searching rhetoric\\", and, indeed, of all his compositions, this is the one with the greatest twelve-tone influence. It is a one-movement work in five sections, marked Moderato-Vivace-Allegro-Andante-Allegro, and is shorter than his other symphonies, typically lasting some fifteen minutes in performance. Unlike with his other symphonies, Lilburn provided a synopsis for this work: > The first [episode], introductory, develops an idea heard from a solo > bassoon. The second is an Allegro set going by solo trumpet. This reverts to > the mood of the introduction until the side drum decides on another Allegro. > The fourth section is a slower one, again launched by trumpet and concerned > with some dialogue for brass. This also returns briefly to the introduction, > and the final section is in the nature of a fragmented coda.Quoted in the > liner notes to the Naxos edition The opening statement of the symphony contains a three-note rising figure which directly recalls Sings Harry, Lilburn's song cycle to words of Denis Glover, and some critics have identified Harry, and Lilburn's identification with the character, as the true subject of the symphony.Robert Hoskins, writing in the liner notes to the Naxos edition The Third Symphony was among Lilburn's last purely acoustic compositions; soon after its completion he turned his attention to electronic music, in which field he spent the remainder of his career.

From 1610, she worked for the Gonzagas in Mantua. Members of her family also worked for the court, including her brothers, Giambattista Basile, a poet, Lelio Basile, a composer, and her sisters, Margherita and Vittoria, who were both singers. Her husband, Mutio Baroni, and her three children, her son Camillo, and two daughters, Leonora and Caterina were also at the court. Leonora and Caterina were both successful singers in their own right. Claudio Monteverdi declared that Basile was a more talented singer than Francesca Caccini, who was at that time at the Medici court. Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga awarded Basile a barony in the Monferrato, and she was also well regarded by Vincenzo's sons Francesco and Ferdinando. While still working for the Mantuan court, she travelled to Florence, Rome, Naples, and Modena. She performed in Alessandro Guarini's Licori, ovvero L’incanto d’amore. In 1626 she retired from the service of the Gonzagas, and moved to Naples and later Rome. None of Basile's music survives, but she is known to have improvised on poetry, including in a competition with Caccini in November 1623. A number of composers have left musical tributes in her honour, while a collection of poetic tributes, \\"Il teatro delle glorie\\", was first published in Venice in 1623 and then, in expanded form, in Naples in 1628. It has been proposed that a painting by Antiveduto Gramatica of Santa Cecilia with two musical angels depicts Adriana's harp. The harp is decorated with the coat of arms and imprese of the Gonzaga family, and Adriana's own coat of arms. ==References== *Alessandro Ademollo, La bell'Adriana ed altre virtuose del suo tempo alla corte di Mantova: contributo di documenti per la sotoriam della musica in Italia nel primo quarto del seicento.

Her father, a prosperous businessman and a staunch Presbyterian of Scottish heritage, moved the family to Chicago in 1869.Nell was the second of five children. Her oldest sister, Flora Thompson Hopkins, was president of the Dane County Women's Christian Temperance Union, and her younger sister, Ada, was married to early film maker George Kirke Spoor. \\"Flora Hopkins, WCTU Leader, Dies at 78,\\"Wisconsin State Journal (May 18, 1944). As a teenager, Nell taught a Sunday School class at Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church,In her early years, the pastor of Jefferson Park Presbyterian was the noted evangelical Francis Landey Patton, who later served as president of Princeton Theological Seminary. and by eighteen, she had been made supervisor of the Intermediate Department and was an influential member of the Christian Endeavor Society, the Presbyterian youth organization. Recognizing her executive abilities, her father sent her to business college, although her mother objected to such \\"unladylike\\" pursuits.Opal Cording Overmeyer, Remarkable Ma Sunday: The Story of a Wonderful Life (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1957), 8-9. According to an oft-repeated story, Helen said that she had met Billy Sunday at a church social shortly after his conversion to Christianity.Sunday could never remember the date of this experience, although he made repeated reference to it. The oft-told conversion story poses a number of chronological difficulties. The best explication of the problems and their partial solutions is Wendy Knickerbocker, Sunday at the Ballpark (Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2000), 59-63, 79-89. William Thompson at first objected to the noted White Stockings baseball player becoming the suitor of his daughter. Nevertheless, he softened, and the couple was married in the Thompson home on September 5, 1888. The Sundays had four children: Helen Edith (1890), George Marquis (1892), William Ashley Jr. (1901) and Paul Thompson (1907). == Evangelistic campaign manager == Billy Sunday had left professional baseball for religious work in 1891, and by 1896, he had begun his own evangelistic career. Billy, who was naturally shy and who had suffered a series of losses as a child, leaned on Nell for emotional support as well as for such mundane chores as paying his bills, making his travel arrangements, and generally putting his affairs in order. Billy trusted Nell's \\"good horse sense\\" and averred that he had \\"never yet gone contrary to Mrs. Sunday's advice\\" without finding himself \\"up against it.\\"William G. McLoughlin, Billy Sunday Was His Real Name (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955), 76, 16; Elijah P. Brown, The Real Billy Sunday (New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1914), 232; Melton Wright, Giant for God: A Biography of the Life of William Ashley (\\"Billy\\") Sunday (Boyce, VA: Carr Publishing Company, Inc. 1951), 245, 289; Bob Jones [Jr.], Cornbread and Caviar: Reflections and Reminiscences (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, 1985), 89, 91. In 1908, Nell and Billy agreed that she would travel with him, leaving the three younger children in the care of a nanny. Nell managed the campaign organization and energized the Sunday publicity machine. Her formidable manner \\"struck terror to the hearts\\" of those who tried to take advantage of her husband. Her loyalty and sincerity made her Billy's mainstay. Nell acted as a buffer between Sunday and the outside world, making it possible for him to concentrate on his preaching. It is doubtful that without her assistance he could have become the sensational attraction that he became.Jones, 91-92. As Sunday's campaigns grew larger, Nell herself began to speak regularly at women's meetings and civic organizations, becoming a significant religious figure in her own right. She answered Sunday's voluminous mail, and for a few years at the height of her husband's popularity during World War I, Nell even wrote (or at least, had ghost written) a syndicated feature called \\"Mrs. Billy Sunday’s Column,\\" in which she dispensed advice to women about such dangers to their womanhood as dancing and flirting.Lyle Dorsett, Billy Sunday and the Redemption of Urban America (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1991), 101. An extensive collection of Nell Sunday's columns are available in the Papers of William and Helen Sunday, (Wheaton, IL: Wheaton College, Billy Graham Center, 1978) [microfilm]. Nell Sunday supported greater opportunities for women, including women's work during World War I. In one column she wrote, \\"At last, the doors of the Doll House have been opened and women have been invited to come into the great world outside. The rest is in their own hands.\\"\\"Having Faith in Women,\\" Sunday Papers, Box 11, Folder 5, Reel 17. == Children == The Sundays’ three sons, pampered but largely reared by strangers, embarrassed their parents with their errant lifestyles. George was arrested for drunkenness and auto theft before he committed suicide in 1933. Billy Jr. died in an automobile accident in 1938; and Paul, a test pilot, died in an airplane crash in 1944. Furthermore, their oldest child, Helen Haines, though happily married, developed a degenerative disease and died of pneumonia in 1932.Dorsett, 130-31, 159-160. The boys’ ex-wives remained a continuing dilemma for the Sundays. Some blackmailed the evangelist to keep quiet about their son's infidelities. Others used gentler techniques to extract money, and Nell often provided friendly advice to the women when she responded with financial assistance.There are numerous letters from wives and ex-wives to the Sundays in the Sunday Papers. Billy called them \\"damnable, gold-digging, lazy, useless dolls.\\" Billy Sunday to Nell Sunday (1929), Sunday Papers, Box 3, Folder 37, Reel 2. == A career of her own == When Billy Sunday died in 1935, Nell became the guardian of her husband's image while also embarking on her own 22-year ministry, preaching, encouraging young evangelists and raising money for Christian organizations, especially rescue missions such as the Pacific Garden Mission, where her husband had been converted. On one occasion she told Grace Theological Seminary President Alva J. McClain, who was introducing her, \\"You sit down now so I can talk to these young people about the Lord!\\"Roger A. Bruns, Preacher: Billy Sunday and the Big-Time American Evangelism (New York: W. W. Norton, 1992), 300. A \\"sketchy housekeeper,\\" Nell Sunday was noted for scavenging food for later meals when invited to dinner. Thriftier than anyone else in the Sunday family, Nell was nonetheless generous with both her time and her money, especially where she perceived a genuine need. Furthermore, she had a sense of humor that \\"helped her bear heavy tragedies and got her easily over some rough places.\\" And she could laugh at herself as well as others. Nell Sunday lived long enough to speak at early Billy Graham crusades, and she frequently visited Bob Jones College, where she was given an honorary degree in 1940. (A residence hall on the Greenville campus was also named in her honor.) In her later years, Nell Sunday suffered from cataracts, heart attacks, and cancer. In 1957, she died in Phoenix, Arizona, where she had been spending the winter with her grandson, Paul Haines.Dorsett, 160. Old friends conducted her funeral. After two eulogies, Bob Jones Jr. said, \\"I can hear Ma Sunday now saying, 'That's enough of this foolishness. Let's get down to business and talk about Jesus.'\\"Jones, 94. == Notes == == External links == * Billy Sunday On-line Compiled by the pastor of King's Valley Chapel in Kingfield, Maine, this website contains Sunday sermons, images, audio, biographical timeline, and online bookstore. * Billy Sunday Home Museum The Sunday family home, known as \\"Mount Hood\\", is located in Winona Lake, Indiana.

It is parallel to the stream known as Binczarce. ==History== Binczarowa was first mentioned in Polish history in 1365, in a decree of Casimir the Great, under the name Bibyczareban, which forced the city of Grybow to give up its rights to the surrounding forest. In 1531, the Rusyn Ivan Trukhanovych (Polish: Iwan Truchanowicz) obtained the town and Polish nobility from Sigismund I the Old. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, it was part of the Galician district of Grybów, and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was the birthplace of Jaroslav Kacmarcyk (1885-1944), president of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic, and of Metodyj Trochanovskij (1885-1947), who published a Lemko grammar. It was briefly independent from December 5, 1918, until March, 1920, as part of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic (Ruska Narodna Respublika Lemkiu, or Ruska Lemkivska Respublyka). After World War II, it was depopulated by the Polish government in Operation Vistula in 1947. ==Geography== Binczarowa is a Lemko village in the western Lemkivshchyna. It occupies a mountain valley in the Polish commune of Grybów, county of Nowy Sącz, Lesser Poland Voivodeship. It is situated along a stream known as the Binczarce, a tributary of the Poprad. It lies between the towns of Florynka to the east and Bogusza in the west. ==Culture and Religion== The town is the site of St. Dymitr's Church, built in 1760.

It was formerly part of the Huntington West Division. It became part of the CSX Florence Division on June 20, 2016. Running from Elkhorn City, Kentucky, south to Erwin, Tennessee, it forms the north half of the former Clinchfield Railroad; the south half, from Erwin to Spartanburg, South Carolina, is now the Blue Ridge Subdivision. From Elkhorn City, the line continues north as the Big Sandy Subdivision to Catlettsburg, Kentucky, on the Ohio River; trains can then continue to Ohio and other Midwest points. From Spartanburg, trains can continue to Georgia, Florida, or other Southeast states.CSX Huntington West Division Timetable ==Route description== The line begins at Elkhorn City, Kentucky, at the south end of the Big Sandy Subdivision. It continues southeast alongside the Russell Fork of the Big Sandy River through Breaks Interstate Park to Haysi, Virginia. The line uses the valley of the McClure River from Haysi to Nora and McClure Creek from Nora to Trammel. Between Trammel and Dante, the line crosses under the Sandy Ridge (Tennessee Valley Divide) using the Sandy Ridge Tunnel. At Dante, the line follows Lick Creek southerly to St. Paul, where it interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) Clinch Valley Division. Then it heads southwesterly along the Clinch River to Speers Ferry, heading south through Clinch Mountain in the Clinch Mountain Tunnel to Kermit. From Kermit east- southeasterly to the Tennessee state line, the railroad generally heads cross- country and alongside small creeks, most notably Possum Creek. After crossing into Tennessee, the line crosses the NS Appalachia Division at Frisco. This junction allows CSX trains to use NS trackage rights to reach their Cumberland Valley Subdivision at Big Stone Gap, Virginia and NS trains to use CSX trackage between Frisco and St. Paul. The Kingsport Subdivision continues southeast from Frisco, picking up the valley of the North Fork Holston River and then the South Fork Holston River into downtown Kingsport. The line continues generally southeasterly through the South Fork valley, but also cross-country, to Johnson City. Then it heads south-southeast to Okolona and south-southwesterly near Buffalo Creek to Unicoi and North Indian Creek to its end at Erwin, where the Blue Ridge Subdivision continues. On October 15, 2015 CSX Transportation announced it was closing the Erwin yard facility, with a loss of 300 jobs. All through traffic trains would cease using the Clinchfield Route, aka Kingsport Subdivision. Industries around Kingsport and Johnson City, TN would still be serviced by trains coming North from Spartanburg, SC and Bostic, NC, as would the Alpha Natural Resources (now part of Contura Energy) coal preparation facility in McClure, VA by trains coming south from Shelbiana, Ky. Norfolk Southern would still use the line from St. Paul to Frisco, VA via a trackage rights arrangement with the CSX. The line between St. Paul and McClure (19.4 miles) would be idled immediately, effectively ending the use of the Kingsport Subdivision as a functioning bridge route between Spartanburg and Elkhorn City. It has been reported, however, that there have been instances of equipment running between Shelbiana, Ky and Dante, Va. The line officially retains its mothballed status as of Spring 2017, even though several through freights have used the line in recent weeks running from Shelbiana, KY to Kingsport, TN and points south. The \\"Santa Claus Special,\\" a decades-long CSX-Clinchfield Railroad tradition of distributing toys, candy and gifts to the residents along the line during the Christmas season, continues to this day from Shelbiana and Elkhorn City to the yard at Kingsport.

Such was Slovakia's lack of preparedness, that the motorised Hungarian columns initially met almost no resistance, reportedly surprising two companies of Slovaks in their beds. == The situation of the Slovak Army == Lieutenant-General Augustín Malár was responsible for the defence of the eastern border with Ruthenia. VI Corps, which he had inherited from the Czecho-Slovak Army, had already been seriously disrupted the previous autumn by the First Vienna Award, which had obliged it to abandon its border fortifications and remove its headquarters from Košice to Prešov. The Hungarian occupation of Ruthenia (Carpatho-Ukraine), where the garrison, the 12th Division, had come under VI Corps' jurisdiction, had further undermined it. As VI Corps had largely been based among unreliable Hungarians and Ruthenes, it had a very high proportion of Czechs in its ranks. The 12th Infantry Division was involved in a fighting retreat back into eastern Slovakia over the period of March 14-18, but it then dissolved itself virtually completely as its Czech officers and men headed for home. Similarly, the regiments of the VI Corps' Slovak-based 11th and 17th Divisions, which should have had 2,000-3,000 men each, were only left with between 70 and 400 Slovaks apiece once all their Czechs had gone home. This left the eastern border virtually undefended. Therefore, Malár began to fill out his skeleton units with the reservists called up on March 15. At the same time, Generals Jurech and Imro, in the west of the country began to form units to support Malár as Slovak officers and conscripts began to return from Bohemia and Moravia, but their move to the east was delayed because roads and railways became crowded with Czech troops being repatriated in the opposite direction. The whole repatriation and reinforcement operation had to be organised by the various inexperienced and desperately overstretched Slovak staffs, especially that of Malár in Prešov. There was often bad feelings on both sides. One Slovak artillery officer detraining from Moravia was dismayed to be roundly abused at the station by a Slovak officer, who assumed from his rank that he must be a Czech. Some Czech troops sabotaged their equipment rather than let the Slovaks have it. Malár did manage to persuade a number of Czech officers to stay on temporarily to help Slovakia against the Hungarians, but the general confusion could not be adequately sorted out during the very brief period of hostilities with Hungary. These factors also prevented the remains of the Czechoslovak 3rd Rapid Division, which was based in the far west of the country from being deployed to good effect in the east. Its 3rd Tank Regiment was left with only 10 out of 60 officers and 222 out of 821 other ranks when all the Czech soldiers went home. This was a decisive disadvantage, because the regiment's 70 (out of an establishment of 98) LT vz. 34 (18) and LT vz. 35 (52) light tanks, 30 ČKD/Praga Tančik vz. 33 tankettes, 3 OA vz. 27 and 10 OA vz. 30 armoured cars were more than a match for the five obsolete Fiat 3000B light tanks, 70 Ansaldo 35M tankettes and 3 Crossley 29M armoured cars of the Hungarian invasion force. The only armour Malár had available in Eastern Slovakia were the 9 (10 - 1 destroyed) Gendarmerie - sold/gifted from Czech military after the 1938 Munich Agreement rendered them surplus-to-requirements - OA vz. 30 armoured cars and nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humenné and Prešov.A tenth LT vz. 34 had broken down during the retreat and had had to be abandoned to the Hungarians. However, once in Slovakia their embittered Czech crews had sabotaged all of them. As a result, none of them were immediately available when the fighting started on the 23 March. == VI Corps == Commander-in-Chief: Lieutenant-General Augustín Malár :* 16th Infantry Regiment (partially) :* 20th Infantry Regiment :* 37th Infantry Regiment (partially) :* 12th Artillery Regiment (partially) :* 112th Artillery Regiment (partially) :* Armoured Car Platoon (9 OA vz. 30 armoured cars) :* Tank Platoon (3 LT vz. 35 light tanks) == Air Force == :* 45th Flight (based in Spišská Nová Ves with 10 Avia B-534 fighter aircraft) :* 49th Flight (based in Spišská Nová Ves with 10 Avia B-534 fighter aircraft) :* 12th Flight (based in Spišská Nová Ves with 10 Letov Š-28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and Aero AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft) :* 13th Flight (based in Spišská Nová Ves with 10 Letov Š-28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft) ==Notes== ==Sources== * Axworthy, Mark W.A.

It carried the Lunokhod No.201 rover. == Launch == Luna E-8 No.201 was launched at 06:48:15 UTC on 19 February 1969 atop a Proton-K 8K78K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24. The payload shroud collapsed at T+51 seconds as the booster was passing through the point of maximum aerodynamic pressure and debris struck the Proton's external N2O2 tanks at high speed, puncturing them and allowing oxidizer to spill out and ignite on contact with the engine exhaust, resulting in the explosion of the first stage. The upper stages were blasted free and eventually impacted the ground. It was determined that the failure was due to a design flaw in the untested new payload shroud developed for the launch.

Retrieved 26 Sep. 2009. (These three assumptions, and not one synoptic theory, are the shared presuppositions of Jerusalem School members.) The first two assumptions are perhaps not shared by the majority of New Testament scholars, but are neither considered to be fringe positions. Today, the common view is that Jesus and His milieu spoke Aramaic, however that Hebrew was spoken and even important is not unique to the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research.As early as the beginning of the 20th century, we already have: Moses Hirsch Segal Mishnaic Hebrew and Its Relation to Biblical Hebrew and to Aramaic. A Grammatical Study ... Reprinted from the Jewish Quarterly Review for July Horace Hart: Oxford, 1909. Many more New Testament Scholars worldwide have increasingly affirmed the importance of Jewish culture for the understanding of Jesus. John P. Meier is exemplary of this significant trend when he poignantly criticizes scholarship in the twentieth century that has paid lip service to the 'Jewish Jesus' but has not really fleshed this out, stating that if we do not have a halachic Jesus, we don't have an historical Jesus.Meier \\"rejects a major academic failure of Jesus research: mouthing respect for Jesus' Jewishness while avoiding like the plague the beating heart of that Jewishness: the Torah in all its complexity. However bewildering the positions Jesus sometimes takes, he emerges from this volume as a Palestinian Jew engaged in the legal discussions and debates proper to his time and place. It is Torah and Torah alone that puts flesh and bones on the spectral figure of \\"Jesus the Jew.\\" No halakic Jesus, no historical Jesus. This is the reason why many American books on the historical Jesus may be dismissed out of hand: their presentation of lst-century Judaism and especially of Jewish Law is either missing in action or so hopelessly skewed that it renders any portrait of Jesus the Jew distorted from the start. It is odd that it has taken American scholarship so long to absorb this basic insight: either one takes Jewish Law seriously and \\"gets it right\\" or one should abandon the quest for the historical Jesus entirely.....The patient reader of Volume Four of A Marginal Jew may at this juncture be sick unto death of the mantra, 'the historical Jesus is the halakic Jesus.' But at least such readers have been inoculated for life against the virus that induces legal amnesia in most Americans writing on Jesus. The halakic dimension of the historical Jesus is never exciting but always essential.\\" John P. Meier, \\"Conclusion to Volume Four\\" in A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Volume IV: Law and Love, (The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library: Yale University Press, 2009), 648 and 649. The third assumption of the Jerusalem School basically seems to be concerned with not holding to an assumed-default position of Markan priority. It is especially the third assumption in more individually pronounced forms that has invited a response of the academic community. Some scholars have perceived the Jerusalem School as a group that holds to Lukan Priority.Among others: Delbert Royce Burkett, Rethinking the Gospel sources: from proto-Mark to Mark, T&T; Clark: NY, 4. Beate Ego,Armin Lange,Peter Pilhofer, Gemeinde ohne Tempel /Community without Temple, Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament, Mohr Siebeck: Tubingen, 462n2 But this perception is incomplete since it is only Robert Lindsey and David Bivin who have argued strongly for Lukan priority. The third methodological assumption of the Jerusalem School is much broader and open, without any one theory being affirmed: Many scholars affirm Semitic quality of the Synoptic Gospel material as indicative of earlier material, but how to determine Semitic quality has been hotly debated. Recently this subject of a Hebrew Gospel and Semitic material has been discussed by James R. Edwards (although with somewhat differing results than Jerusalem School members).James R. Edwards, The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009.

(2014) The language environment of first century Judaea : Jerusalem studies in the Synoptic Gospels. Leiden: Brill. (Jewish and Christian perspectives series, 26)The articles in this collection demonstrate that a change is taking place in New Testament studies. Throughout the twentieth century, New Testament scholarship primarily worked under the assumption that only two languages, Aramaic and Greek, were in common use in the land of Israel in the first century. The current contributors investigate various areas where increasing linguistic data and changing perspectives have moved Hebrew out of a restricted, marginal status within first-century language use and the impact on New Testament studies. Five articles relate to the general sociolinguistic situation in the land of Israel during the first century, while three articles present literary studies that interact with the language background. The final three contributions demonstrate the impact this new understanding has on the reading of Gospel texts.

Blizzard Jr. Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus, Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image Publishers, 1994. by David Bivin and Roy B. Blizzard Jr. which was reviewed by Michael L. Brown. The book itself is not published by the Jerusalem School, and only one of the co-authors is of the Jerusalem School. Yet, Brown not only questioned the work of individual school member David Bivin and co-author Roy Blizzard Jr., but by association also the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research as a whole. Yet, even in his criticism of reconstructing a Hebrew Gospel (of which many Jerusalem School members are skeptical of as well), he affirms three significant points, which dovetail with the methodology—the three assumptions—of the Jerusalem School: Since the Jerusalem School has not devoted itself primarily to the hypothetical work of REtranslation and reconstruction, the latter criticism is muted. (The Jerusalem School has never attempted to translate the Greek texts into proto-Mishnaic Hebrew in order to thereby declare it to be the reconstructed original Hebrew Gospel. See Lindsey's 'A Hebrew Translation of the Gospel of Mark for a translation of Mark' - which is a translation of Mark, not a reconstruction of a supposed original Gospel.) A further academic description of the Jerusalem School and its methodology and dissemination in the lay and academic field is found in Hebräisches Evangelium und synoptische Überlieferung: Untersuchungen zum hebräischen Hintergrund der Evangelien.Baltes, Guido.

It was also formerly known as Shen River (). Two of Liaoning's most important cities, the provincial capital Shenyang and the seventh largest city Fushun, are located on the Hun River. Running 415 kilometres (258 mi) and draining a basin of 11,500 square kilometres (4,400 sq mi), the Hun River has numerous tributaries, 31 of which have catchment areas greater than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). It flows through the most populous area of Liaoning Province, including the provincial capital and largest city in Northeast China, Shenyang, as well as the 10th largest city, Fushun. ==Name== The name Hun River () means \\"the muddy river.\\" This name comes from the Hun's fast flow speed and high sediment load, which leads to its muddy appearance. Historically the Hun was also known as Little Liao River (). The river's middle section was also formerly known as the Shen River (). The capital city Shenyang to the north of the river was named for the Shen River. The lower section is also known as the Clam River (). ==Geography== The Hun River's headwaters arise from the Qian Mountains, a branch of the Changbai Mountains, where the river is also called Nalu River () or Red River (), and flows into the 5,437 cubic kilometres (1,304 cu mi) Dahuofang Reservoir (), which supplies drinking water to the surrounding cities of Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Anshan, Panjin, Yingkou, and Dalian. Until 1958, the Hun River joined the Wailiao River and then the Taizi River near Haicheng. Together, they formed the Daliao River, which drains into the Liaodong Bay. The confluence of the three rivers was known as \\"the Trident River.\\" In 1958, a river engineering project was conducted to address flood control problem in the coastal area near Yingkou. The upper reaches of the Wailiao River at Liujianfang was blocked off, diverting the Liao River towards the Shuangtaizi River. This effectively separated the Hun and Taizi rivers from the main body of Liao River system. Since 1958 the Hun and Taizi rivers are considered an independent river system of their own, and are no longer part of the Liao. ==References== Category:Rivers of Liaoning ","title":"Hun River (Liao River tributary)"},{"id":"7793701","text":"Výborná () is a village and municipality in Kežmarok District in the Prešov Region of north Slovakia. ==History== In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1289.

Pam's first survey exhibition was held at the Art Gallery of Western Australia in 1986, followed by a mid-career retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1991, his largest solo show to date at the Sogo Nara Museum of Art in Japan and was the subject of a major exhibition at the Comptoir de la Photographie in Paris in 1990, which covered the work of three decades. He has published several photographic monographs and 'carnets de voyage'. ==Life and work== Pam was born in Melbourne, Australia. As a teenager he found post-war suburban Melbourne grim, oppressive and culturally isolated. He found refuge in the counter-culture of surfing and the imagery of National Geographic and Surfer Magazine and became determined to travel overseas. Pam left Australia at 20, after accepting a job as a photographer assisting an astrophysicist. Together, the pair drove a Volkswagen from Calcutta to London. This journey proved inspirational, and Pam has continued to travel, and travel be a theme in his work. As Gary Dufour noted in his essay in Indian Ocean Journals (Steidl, 2000): \\"Each photograph is shaped by incidents experienced as a traveller. His photographs extend upon the tradition of the gazetteer; each photograph a record of an experience, a personal account of an encounter somewhere in the world. Each glimpse is part of an unfolding story rather than simply a record of a place observed. While travel underscores his production Pam’s photographs are not the accidental evidence of a tourist.\\" Pam has worked in Asian counties, Europe, Australia, and the Indian Ocean Rim cultures including India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Yemen, Tanzania, Mauritius, Madagascar, the Cocos and Christmas Islands. The images leave the viewer, as Tim Winton said in Going East (Marval 1992), \\"grateful for having been taken so mysteriously by surprise and so far and sweetly abroad.\\" He has published work in journals and is represented in major public and private collections in Australia, Great Britain, France and Japan. Pam is the subject of episode five of the television series Visual Instincts (Artemis International, 1989).

The upper stage failed to ignite, and consequently the spacecraft failed to achieve orbit. Prior to the release of information about its mission, NASA correctly identified that it had been an attempted sample return mission.

The reason(s) for the confusion regarding the name may stem from other similarly named, educated or religious people of the era, and additionally, that he is often mistakenly referred to as a Doctor in some surviving manuscripts. Other figures that add to the confusion are figures such as Dr. John Kent, of Caerleon, who was educated at Cambridge University at the end of the 15th century and famous for his wide-ranging educational accomplishments, or Dr. John Gwent, an erudite friar, buried at Hereford in 1348, a bishop John Kemp, later an Archbishop of York in 1426 and Canterbury in 1452, and a cardinal, who died in 1454, and John a Kent, a raider of the Welsh Marches in 1482/3, whose mischievous exploits were recorded by Anthony Munday in the late 16th century in Munday's 'John A Kent and John A Cumber'. ==Placing him in time and space== From his surviving cywyddau it can reasonably be deduced that he wrote between 1400 and 1430.

He is also associated with the Archenfield area of west Herefordshire and the Ewias or Vale of Ewyas of eastern Monmouthshire. He is believed to have died at Kentchurch Court in the River Monnow valley, but this may be a false tradition. An oil painting, a portrait, hanging at Kentchurch Court and said to be dated to c.1400 by the National Gallery, is said to depict Siôn Cent. The portrait shows a man in late middle age, wearing monkish robes, holding an open book in his left hand and what is possibly a writing implement in the other. Behind him is a view towards a distant ruined castle on a hill and a fortified house approached via a bridge in the middle distance. A tall thin sapling grows in the garden between in the near middle distance. The picture is said to have been painted by Jan van Eyck (1385–1441), the Flemish master portrait artist. The portrait has been shown on the cover of Alex Gibbon's book The Mystery of Jack of Kent & the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr. It has been said to depict Sir John Oldcastle, Sir John Scudamore, Owain Glyndŵr or Siôn Cent. Siôn Cent is said to have been a chaplain to the Scudamore family, secretary to Sir John Scudamore, tutor to his children, later joining a Franciscan order abroad and returning again several years later as chaplain once more. He was said to be highly educated, fluent in Welsh, Latin and English and he is also said to have translated the Bible into Welsh. ==His verse== Siôn is most famous for using his poetry in the service of his Christian beliefs and standing outside the tradition of praise of Patron which was so important in Welsh poetry. He uses the cywydd meter for his work, but in order to attack the sins of this world. His pessimistic outlook is understandable in view of the mortality of the Black Death, wars abroad and at home and the Owain Glyndŵr rebellion which was in full flow in Wales during his lifetime. His cywyddau have one unique feature that marks them out – they are divided into stanzas, the last line of each being the same, and acting as the 'burden' of the poem. It has been said of him that his best and possibly the most accurately attributable of his work concerns the uncertainties of life, all that pertains to that and the inevitability of death and the Last Judgement. He described the world as he saw it, pessimistically, though with some optimism when regarding the possibility of an eternity in heaven. In the 1420s he attacked the work of the bard Rhys Goch Eryri, suggesting that his praise of worldly values were lies prompted by the Devil. Perhaps his most famous poem is \\"I wagedd ac oferedd y byd\\" (\\"In praise of the vanity and wantonness of the world\\"). He turns his back on the praise of nobles, which he sees as flattery and falsehood, and sets his eyes on the blessedness of heaven. Siôn Kent's verse became very popular and he started a vogue for more religious Welsh poetry. In later tradition he was connected to the Marches folklore figure John of Kent or Jack of Kent but this figure is likely to be a combination of several people rather than just him. ==See also== *Jack o' Kent *Medieval Welsh literature *Owain Glyndŵr ==References== * *Charles Williams, The History of Literature in Wales. ==External links== *Siôn Cent at Wikisource Category:Medieval Welsh poets Category:Welsh-language poets Category:15th-century Welsh poets Category:15th-century deaths Category:15th-century Welsh writers Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Siôn Cent"},{"id":"7793735","text":"The Battle of Devina occurred on 17 July 1279 near the small fortress of Devina, close to the modern town of Kotel, Burgas Province, south-eastern Bulgaria. Ivailo of Bulgaria attacked the Byzantine army sent to help his rival for the crown Ivan Asen III. == Origins of the conflict == In 1277 in a popular uprising led by Ivailo broke out in north-eastern Bulgaria against the incapability of Emperor Constantine Tikh Asen to cope with the constant Mongol invasions which devastated the country for years. The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos decided to make use of the instability in Bulgaria. He sent an army to impose his ally Ivan Asen III on the throne. Ivan Asen III gained control of the area between Vidin and Cherven. Ivailo was besieged by the Mongols at Drastar (Silistra) and the nobility in the capital Tarnovo accepted Ivan Asen III for Emperor. == The battle == In the same year, however, Ivailo managed to make a breakthrough in Drastar and headed for the capital. In order to help his ally, Michael VIII sent a 10,000-strong army towards Bulgaria under Murin. When Ivailo learned for that campaign he abandoned his march to Tarnovo. Although his troops were outnumbered, the Bulgarian leader attacked Murin in the Kotel Pass on 17 July 1279 and the Byzantines were completely routed. Many of them perished in the battle, while the rest were captured and later killed by orders from Ivailo. == Aftermath == After the defeat Michael VIII sent another army of 5,000 troops under Aprin but it was also defeated by Ivailo before reaching the Balkan Mountains. Without support, Ivan Asen III had to flee to Constantinople. The internal conflict in Bulgaria continued to 1280 when Ivailo had in turn to flee to the Mongols and George I Terter ascended to the throne. == References == ==Sources== * Angelov, D., Cholpanov, B.

It was used as a casualty hospital during the Second World War. In 2002, the University of Wales Swansea reported that the hospital had to lock up patients due to understaffing. Work started in 2009 to build modern replacement mental-health accommodation and facilities, including Ysbryd y Coed, which is purpose-built for patients with dementia, in the grounds of Cefn Coed . Other new-builds in the Cefn Coed grounds are the 18-bed Gwelfor Rehabilitation Unit, a pub featuring non-alcoholic beer called “The Derwen Arms”, and two supported houses for recovering patients preparing to move back home. In March 2015, the health board’s new low-secure mental- health unit, Taith Newydd, opened in Bridgend, replacing some of the old wards at Cefn Coed. Other new mental-health builds include the ARC Centre and Angelton Clinic in Bridgend, and Ty Einon in Swansea. In 2015, the NHS announced that the phased closure of Cefn Coed Hospital would continue for the next three to five years, with several decommissioned wards planned for demolition that year.

The compound consists of a ring of seven carbon atoms with three conjugated alkene groups and a ketone group. The related compound tropolone (2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one) has an additional alcohol (or an enol including the double bond) group next to the ketone. The tropone moiety can be found in biomolecules such as colchicine, stipitatic acid and hinokitiol. Tropone has been known since 1951 and is also called cycloheptatrienylium oxide. The name tropolone was coined by M. J. S. Dewar in 1945 in connection to perceived aromatic properties. ==Properties== Dewar in 1945 proposed that tropones could have aromatic properties. The carbonyl group is polarized with a partial positive charge on the carbon atom (A) and a partial negative charge on oxygen. In an extreme case the carbon atom has a full positive charge (B) forming a tropylium ion ring which is an aromatic 6 electron system (C). :Tropone structures Tropolone is acidic (conjugate base shown, E) with a pKa of 7 which is in between that of phenol (10) and benzoic acid (4). The increased acidity compared to phenol is due to regular resonance stabilization. Tropones and to a lesser extent tropolones are also basic (D) and this is very much due to aromatic stabilization. This property can be observed in the ease of salt formation with acids. The dipole moment for tropone is 4.17 D compared to a value of only 3.04 D for cycloheptanone, which can also be taken as evidence for aromaticity. ==Synthesis== Numerous methods exist for the organic synthesis of tropones and its derivatives. Two selected methods for the synthesis of tropone are by selenium dioxide oxidation of cycloheptatriene and indirectly from tropinone by a Hofmann elimination and a bromination. :Tropone synthesis Two methods for the synthesis of tropolone are by bromination of 1,2-cycloheptanedione with N-bromosuccinimide followed by dehydrohalogenation at elevated temperatures and by acyloin condensation of the ethyl ester of pimelic acid the acyloin again followed by oxidation by bromine. :Tropolone synthesis ==Reactions== *Tropone undergoes ring contraction to benzoic acid with potassium hydroxide at elevated temperature. Many derivatives also contract to the corresponding arene compounds. * Tropone reacts in electrophilic substitution, for instance with bromine, but the reaction proceeds through the 1,2-addition product and is not an electrophilic aromatic substitution. :Tropone bromination * Tropone derivatives also react in nucleophilic substitution very much like in nucleophilic aromatic substitution. :Tropone nucleophilic substitution * Tropone is a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, for instance with maleic anhydride. * Tropone is also found to react in an [8+3]annulation with a cinnamic aldehydeAn N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Catalyzed [8 + 3] Annulation of Tropone and Enals via Homoenolate Vijay Nair, Manojkumar Poonoth, Sreekumar Vellalath, Eringathodi Suresh, and Rajasekaran Thirumalai J.

It connected Kings Canyon west of Carson City to the state capitol using various city streets. The route dates to the mid-19th century, as part of a wagon trail linking Lake Tahoe and Carson City that was later incorporated into the Lincoln Highway. SR 512 was turned over to local control in 2010. ==Route description== The western terminus of SR 512 was on the western edge of Carson City near the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Kings Canyon. It began on Kings Canyon Road just east of Canyon Drive, where the road passes over Kings Canyon Creek. From there, the route headed eastward around a hill to enter residential areas of Carson City. After , the route intersected Ormsby Boulevard and turned into King Street. State Route 512 continued east another to Division Street, where the route turned south. The highway followed Division Street to West Fifth Street. SR 512 turned east on Fifth Street and traveled to its eastern terminus at South Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 Business/SR 529) just south of the state capitol complex. ==History== ===Early history=== Kings Canyon Road has a history dating before white settlers came to the Eagle Valley, where Carson City now resides. It was originally a Washo Indian trail that crossed over the mountains separating the valley from Lake Tahoe. The trail became more prominent in the 1850s as would-be miners trekked west to California in search of gold. As the Comstock Lode contributed to the growth of areas around Carson City in the 1860s, the trail became an important part of the Bonanza road system, linking the burgeoning Comstock region and Placerville, California. Nevada's territorial government, realizing the need to improve access to and from the west, authorized Alfred Helm and Butler Ives to begin construction of a road through Kings Canyon in 1862. Their route, completed by November 1863 as the final segment of the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road, would become the preferred route connecting Carson City to Spooner's Station east of Glenbrook. Kings Canyon Road was an early branch alignment of State Route 3. After it was completed, the road saw little change or maintenance until the advent of automobiles, when the Bonanza system of wagon roads were adapted to serve the needs of vehicles. In 1913, Kings Canyon Road was selected by the Lincoln Highway Association as part of the Lincoln Highway's southern route over the Sierra Nevadas. Some improvements to the trail began in 1914, when the Carson Good Roads Association began placing route markers along the road. The road was later incorporated into Nevada's state highway system as part of State Route 3. Traffic on the route would decrease significantly starting in 1928, when a new paved route linking Carson City and Spooner's was constructed through Clear Creek Canyon to the south; SR 3 was moved to the new road, which eventually became part of U.S. Route 50. ===The route today=== The original Kings Canyon toll road is about long and is still open to travel. Within Carson City, SR 512 follows the alignment of the original road via portions of Kings Street and Kings Canyon Road. Outside the city west of the state highway terminus, the route is an unpaved forest road within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The Forest Service promotes the road for its historical value, but no longer maintains the roadway. Travel by off-road vehicles or four-wheel drive vehicles with high clearance is highly recommended, as portions of the route are rugged, steep, and can be difficult to pass. As for the route within Carson City limits, State Route 512 had been a designated highway since at least 1983. A proposal to transfer ownership of SR 512 from the Nevada Department of Transportation to Carson City had surfaced by 2007. This action was aimed to reduce the city's required financial contributions to NDOT for the construction of the Carson City Freeway.

The route was originally part of State Route 65, a longer highway that served the eastern outskirts of the city. SR 513 was turned over to Carson City in phases, and completely removed from the state highway system in 2011. ==Route description== State Route 513 began at the intersection of Fifth Street and South Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 Business/State Route 529) in downtown Carson City. At the northeast corner of this intersection is south end of the Nevada capitol complex. SR 513 headed east along East Fifth Street, passing by the Nevada Legislature building and other state facilities. Crossing Roop Street, the route entered a more residential area of the central city. After about a mile (1.6 km), SR 513 became a two-lane road through more open areas. Fifth Street then rises over the Carson City Freeway (U.S. Routes 50 and 395) and touches down next to Nevada State Prison. In 2011, the state highway ended at a roundabout intersection with Fairview Drive just past the prison facility. Another segment of SR 513 existed separately from the main route on Fifth Street. This short section consisted of a bridge over the Carson River on Deer Run Road. This segment was removed from SR 513 in 2010. ==History== SR 513 was previously designated as State Route 65. SR 513 had been a part of Nevada's state highway system since at least 1951. By this time, the route had been defined in state laws as heading east from State Route 3 (Carson Street) to the Nevada State Prison, then turning south and east to the Carson River. That general route had been established as a road by 1937, and was shown on Nevada's official highway maps as State Route 65 by 1973. The route appears to have followed what is now Fifth Street and Carson River Road. The SR 65 designation stayed in place until Nevada officials began renumbering the state's highways on July 1, 1976. On that date, State Route 513 was the new number assigned to the highway. This change was seen on the state highway map in 1982. After becoming SR 513, the route remained unchanged for many years. The road was realigned west of the state prison in 2008-09, as the new bridge over US 50/395 was constructed. A transfer of ownership of several state highways to Carson City's control was proposed by 2007, in order to reduce the amount of money the city was supposed to pay to the Nevada Department of Transportation for the construction of the Carson City Freeway (future Interstate 580). Under this plan, the portion of State Route 513 on Carson River Road and on Fifth Street east of the Fairview Drive roundabout was removed from the state highway system on May 28, 2009. The remainder of East Fifth Street was turned over to Carson City control on July 11, 2011, eliminating SR 513 from the state highway system. ==References== 513 ","title":"Nevada State Route 513"},{"id":"7794058","text":"Erick Lawrence Swenson (born Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, 1972 Erick Swenson exhibited at the Saatchi Gallery, Saatchi Gallery, London.

This movement would later give way to a massive two-year, $23 million renovation and expansion project that was completed in July 2004. The project gave the Colvin Center approximately of completely new or renovated area, including five new gyms (bringing the total number to eleven) and a golf center with three driving-range practice nets, a practice putting green and two golf simulators. Other amenities include an indoor pool and outdoor pool, dance studios, climbing wall, indoor jogging tracks, racquetball courts, and cardio and fitness equipment. The weight and fitness-training areas alone have more than tripled in size from 9,000 to more than with $600,000 of new equipment. In 2005, the Colvin Center was named as one of the top six collegiate sports centers in the United States by the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association. ==References== Category:Oklahoma State University Category:Buildings and structures in Stillwater, Oklahoma Category:University and college student recreation centers in the United States Category:1969 establishments in Oklahoma Category:Sports venues completed in 1969 ","title":"Colvin Center"},{"id":"7794103","text":"Gruffudd Hiraethog (died 1564) was a Welsh language poet, born in Llangollen, north-east Wales.Meic Stephens [ed.] The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales (Oxford University Press, 1986) Gruffudd was one of the foremost poets of the sixteenth century to use the cywydd metre.

Attaway, a physician and founder of the National Negro Insurance Association, and Florence Parry Attaway, a school teacher. When Attaway was six, he moved with his family to Chicago, Illinois, as part of the Great Migration, to escape the segregated South. === Education === In Chicago, Attaway showed little interest in school until he was assigned a poem written by Langston Hughes. Once he learned that Hughes was a black poet, Attaway decided to start applying himself to his school work. He even enjoyed writing so much that he wrote for his sister Ruth's amateur dramatic groups.Jacobs, Nancy N. “William Attaway”. The Mississippi Writers and Musicians Project at Starkville High School. 2000. Starkville High School. Sept. 27, 2006. After graduating from high school, Attaway enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. There, he was a tennis college champion. Even though he was doing well at college, upon his father's death Attaway dropped out and became a traveling worker for two years. During these years he worked as a salesman, a labor organizer, and a seaman,“William Attaway, a great all-around writer!”. 2005. The African American Registry. Sept. 27, 2006. and began to collect material for his later works. After getting his B.A. (1935) from the University of Illinois and having published \\"The Tale of the Blackamoor\\" in Challenge, he traveled around the US before settling into New York City. === Family and personal life === Attaway was married in 1962 to a woman named Frances Settele. They lived in Barbados for eleven years with their two children, Bill and Noelle. Frances Attaway was a white woman originally from New York. They had a 20 years-long courtship before going public and official with their union as racial tension was present until the 1960s. Despite the MLK civil rights movement, Frances and William moved their family to the Caribbean to escape racial turmoil and death threats. William Attaway's daughter, Noelle, recalls records of Martin Luther King Jr. calling William Attaway \\" a fellow freedom fighter\\" and both marched side by side during the civil rights movement. === Death === During his last years, Attaway lived in Los Angeles, California, writing screenplays. He died on June 17, 1986, of heart failure. == Literary career == In 1935, Attaway began working on his first project as he helped to write the Federal Writers' Project guide to Illinois. While he was working on this project he became good friends with Richard Wright, another soon-to-be-famous novelist. After his first project was over, Attaway returned to the University of Illinois and received his degree. He then moved to New York, where his drama Carnival was produced. His first short story, \\"Tale of the Blackamoor\\", was published in 1936. In between works, he worked many odd jobs and even tried acting with his sister Ruth. Ruth later became a successful Broadway actress, and she ultimately helped to fuel Attaway's career. In 1939, Attaway's first novel, Let Me Breathe Thunder, was published. He then began working on his second and last novel, Blood on the Forge. After Blood on the Forge, Attaway began to write songs, screenplays, and books about music. His main works include Calypso Song Book and Hear America Singing. Attaway and Irving Burgie co-wrote the famous song \\"Day-O\\" (Banana Boat Song) for calypso singer Harry Belafonte. In the 1950s, Attaway began to write for radio, TV, and films. He was the first African American to write scripts for film and TV. He wrote for programs such as Wide Wide World and Colgate Hour. Despite having published works approved by critics, Attaway's work never gained the mainstream fame enjoyed by some other African-American authors, for example Richard Wright, whose Native Son was published in 1940. == Popular music == === Calypso Song Book === In Calypso Song Book,Attaway, William. Calypso Song Book. London:Oxford University Press Ltd. 1957. Attaway describes \\"Calypso, the Western Indian music, is enjoying a great revival among all sorts of music lovers, from serious students of folk music to sophisticated night-club and theater audiences and followers of the Hit Parade.\\"Attaway, William. Calypso Song Book. London:Oxford University Press Ltd. 1957. Page 6. Attaway further explains that \\"Calypso can be divided into two categories: the bracket form, for bouncy ditties that are mostly nonsense, and the ballade, the most common form for serious topics.\\" However, Attaway admits \\"the humorous twist is a necessary part of any true Calypso song.\\" Each song not only has sheet music in Calypso Song Book, but it also has a brief narration, except two songs, right next to the title which is provided by Attaway and an illustration by William Charmatz. === Hear America Singing === George P. Weick in Harlem Renaissance LivesEdited by Henry Louis Gates JR. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Harlem Renaissance Lives From The African American National Biography, New York, Oxford University Press, Inc.,2009,, p.24. points out that in 1967, Attaway published for children a compilation of representative popular music in America, including historical commentary, Hear America Singing. Harry Belafonte in the Hear America Singing introduction writes the folk singing is no longer a spectator sport—it is an essential part of growing up. Folk music is just exactly what it claims to be—the music of the people; not of individuals, but all the people. Belafonte continues the term \\"folk\\" was originally applied only to the peasants and farmers of the Old World, who had never learned to read or write. The evolution of democracy slowly expanded the meaning of the world until it came to stand for all proud and common people. In Chapter FourAttaway, William.Hear America Singing. New York:The Lion Press, Inc.1967. – We Were Always Growing, Attaway describes one of the songs—Always \\"Greensleeves\\"—as following. The folk song, as rule, is always in the process of change. But every rule has its exceptions. This was the one folk song that survived all the centuries, practically untouched. It had come down from Elizabethan England to present-day America without being rewritten. Attaway further expresses although its subject matter was romantic love, it remained a favorite of both Pilgrims and Puritans. The frontiersmen also learned this song, as nearly as they could, in its original form. It was simply too beautiful to change. == Script writing == According to Harlem Renaissance Lives, Attaway's sister, Ruth, helped him to enter the theater world and he also performed in several productions, including a 1939 traveling production of George S. Kaufman's You Can't Take it With You. (PP 23) One Hundred Years of Laughter, a television special on black humor, was one of his most important scripts that was airing in 1966. Attaway is also credited as the screenwriter for the 1981 race-relations TV movie, Grambling's White Tiger, directed by Roots actor Georg Stanford Brown. == Works == === Literature === * Carnival (1935) * Let Me Breathe Thunder (1939) * Blood on the Forge (1941) * Calypso Song Book (1957) * Hear America Singing (nonfiction) (1967) * From These Hills, From These Valleys: Selected Fiction About Western Pennsylvania. (Some of Attaways works were featured in the collection despite not being the main and only author) == Style and themes == === Racial and ecological crisis === William Attaway often kept the main themes of his writing about racial and ecological crisis, especially in his novel Blood on the Forge. In Blood on the Forge, Attaway depicts the hardship of the black community during The Great Migration, which Attaway experienced firsthand when his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1916. Blood on the Forge uses the lives of three brothers to describe the battle that the African-American community went through in order to achieve acceptance and equality. His vivid portrayal of The Great Migration gives the reader an honest insight into the struggles of the African-American community as they moved out of the Southern United States fighting for a better life that they weren't necessarily guaranteed. === Death of the blues === By focusing on the experiences of the Moss brothers in Blood on the Forge, Attaway effectively dramatizes the loss of the folk culture which accompanied the Great Migration of Black people from the rural South to the industrial North, in this case the steel mills of Pennsylvania, around the time of World War I. Though an involved system of symbolic characterization and imagery, Attaway weaves an intricate examination of what might be called the death of the blues—at least the blues as representative of the folk culture. == Legacy == Attaway's literary legacy rests primarily with his novel Blood on the Forge, which has been called the finest depiction of the Great Migration era in American literature. Attaway retains an important place among African-American writers of the early 20th century; the reprinting of Blood on the Forge in 1993 has brought renewed critical and popular attention to his writing. == Notes == == References == * Applegate, Edd (2002).

She was influential in leading a reappraisal of women's literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, and the contributions of women writing about women's experience, including their perspectives on men in the world. ==Early life and family== Judith Fetterley was born in New York City, New York, although she was raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for several years. Her family moved to Franklin, Indiana when she was ten. She studied in public schools, then earned her B.A. degree at Swarthmore College. She did graduate work at Indiana University, where she earned her Ph.D. in English in 1969. ==Career== Fetterley began her academic career at the University of Pennsylvania, where she taught from 1967 to 1973. She moved to the State University of New York at Albany, New York in 1973 where she taught English and women's studies. She left the University at Albany in 2004, having earned the rank of Distinguished Teaching Professor. Fetterley helped formulate the concept of resistant reading in her 1978 book, The Resisting Reader: A Feminist Approach to American Fiction. In addition, she led a reappraisal of women's literature of the 19th century and the American canon. She pointed out that American literature had been defined as about men and by men, thus excluding half of the world: women's experience and perspective. In a series of analyses of works by Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hawthorne, Hemingway, Irving, James, and Mailer, Fetterly in The Resisting Reader places readerly experience at the forefront and argues that American literature—both past and present—has \\"immasculated\\" women readers by compelling them to identify with a so-called universal maleness. This immasculation “burns away” [sic] “the merely personal, the purely subjective” and therefore creates in woman readers a “confusion of consciousness” (xi) in which they cannot read as themselves. Citing John Keats’s complaint that poetry exerts a “palpable design” upon readers, Fetterley writes that American literature does something far more insidious: its designs are \\"impalpable,\\" so women readers fail to recognize its effects (xi). Calling on women readers to intervene, to resist this hailing, Fetterley calls feminist criticism a political act to “to make available to consciousness that which has been left largely unconscious” (xii) and to “change [sic] the consciousness of those who read and their relation to what they read” (vii). Now recognized as a classic of feminist literary criticism, The Resisting Reader generated both praise and critique upon publication. Reviewers were quick to point out that in approach, style, and tone, Fetterley echoed Kate Millett, whose Sexual Politics had preceded The Resisting Reader by almost a decade. For many feminist commentators, this continuity suggested the growth of feminist literary criticism, as well as the continued need for \\"naming the felt reality of American fiction.\\" As the review in the Women's Studies International Quarterly puts it, \\"Fetterley's questions are so often crucial, her observations repeatedly so acute, that they force us to ask how we avoid them in the past.\\" Still others admired the book's feminist heart while expressing discomfort with the vehemence of Fetterley's \\"tone and emphasis.\\" The book also saw its share of anti-feminist response, most of which faulted Fetterley—and by extension, feminism—for an overly narrow and repetitive focus on sexism and gender. Her arguments around resistant readings in this book have since been challenged by Timothy Bewes, a literary critic associated with postcritique, who proposes an approach that involved \\"reading with the grain.\\" In 1980, Fetterley began the project of reading and writing about 19th century American women writers. This resulted in three major publications and a series of articles. Provisions: A Reader from 19th Century American Women appeared in 1985 and American Women Regionalists, co-edited with Marjorie Pryse, appeared 1992. Writing Out of Place: Regionalism, Women and American Literary Culture, written with Marjorie Pryse, appeared in 2003. Since leaving the academic world, Fetterley has become a semi-professional gardener, with a small perennial garden design business called Perennial Wisdom (perennialwisdom.net). She is currently writing a memoir about her experience as a gardener. ==Works== *- The Resisting Reader: A Feminist Approach to American Fiction, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press *- Provisions: A Reader from 19th-Century American Women, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press ==References== *David H.

Della is the first lesbian character to be featured on the show. ==Storylines== Della arrives in Walford in March 1994 as a new assistant to the market trader, Sanjay Kapoor (Deepak Verma). Della is a former hairdresser who had gone to the same school as the barman Steve Elliot (Mark Monero). Realising that Della has a talent that could be a potential money spinner, Steve decides to go into business with her. He and Della make plans to open a hairdressing salon in George Street. The salon, Kool for Kutz, opens in April that year. After some problems at home, Della comes to live with Steve at The Queen Victoria public house, and Steve soon begins seeing her as more than just his business partner. He actively pursues her, which she seems to encourage. However, Della is only leading Steve on in order to mask the fact that she is a lesbian, and days later he catches her in bed with her girlfriend Binnie (Sophie Langham). As a result, Steve throws Della out, which prompts a feud between him and Binnie. Della is mortified that her sexuality has been uncovered and her shame is often a major source of conflict for her girlfriend, who is openly gay. Steve is eventually forced to come to terms with Della's homosexuality although he harbours feelings for her for a long time after. He makes several attempts to convert her into a heterosexual. Binnie and Della soon move into a bedsit on the Square. Problems arise when Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) hears a rumour that they are lesbians and begins spreading hateful rumours about them. This reaction only increases Della's trepidation about living as a lesbian and she starts denying the rumours, claiming that she'd never slept with a woman before in her life. Infuriated by Della's shame, Binnie threatens to leave the Square, which forces Della to prioritise. In order to convince Binnie to stay, Della kisses her in the middle of Bridge Street, which really gives the gossips something to talk about. Binnie spends most of her time on the Square trying to force Della to accept herself as a lesbian. She regularly pressures her to \\"come out\\" to her mother, which often causes fights between them. In January 1995 they go through a bad patch in their relationship, and Della turns to her old friend Steve for support. They arrange an evening out, which again leads Steve to think that she has changed her mind about dating him. After a flirtatious night and plenty of cocktails, Steve tries to convince Della that she isn't really gay and goes to kiss her. Furious, Della storms off and once again leaves Steve looking the fool. Back in Walford, an insanely jealous Binnie jumps to all the wrong conclusions and berates Della for sleeping with Steve. After witnessing them argue, Steve decides to cut his losses and pull out of his partnership at the salon. He signs the lease over to a grateful Della, and promises to never make a pass at her again. Binnie eventually accepts their explanation and she and Della reconcile. Later in the year, Della begins to grow disillusioned with life in Walford, and she and Binnie decide to make a new start in Ibiza. After tying up loose ends, including selling the lease of her salon and firing her obnoxious assistant Lydia (Marlaine Gordon), Della decides that the time had come to tell her mother, Alica, about her sexual orientation. However, after continuous stalling, Alice eventually shows up in Walford and is accidentally informed by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) instead. Unaware of this, Della continues to lie to her mother about her relationship with Binnie, but on her final day she finally works up the courage and telephones her mother with the news. Alice relays that she already knows, and is happy that she has finally told her the truth. Della then leaves with her conscience clear. Her last appearance is in May 1995. ==Character creation and development== Della and Binnie were the first lesbian couple to be featured in EastEnders. Their inclusion was an attempt to portray positive examples of homosexual characters. Their lesbian kiss accounted for some 45 percent of viewer complaints to the BBC regarding EastEnders in 1994; provoking more complaints than any other television programme that year (according to research published by the Broadcasting Standards Council in 1995).\\"Broadcast Concerns 1994-1995\\", Broadcasting Standards Council.

In 2005 their lesbian kiss was featured in E4's X Rated: Top 20 Most Controversial TV Moments, a documentary examining British TV's most talked about on-screen moments. It was placed at number 11 in the chart and, according to the poll, received an estimated 486 viewer complaints and 180 column inches in the British press. In 1995, bisexual actress Pam St. Clement, who plays Pat Evans, was asked if the lesbian storyline suffered from \\"seeming to follow the pack rather than lead it\\". She commented, \\"I think they realised there was something missing, but having given themselves that brief they didn't know what the fuck to do with it. I think Michael Cashman made Colin Russell so successful because he is a gay man. I'd never argue for somebody having to be a part to do it - you don't have to be a murderer to play Othello - and I think the two young girls [who played Della and Binnie] did what they could, but they couldn't really give the programme any help.\\" ==See also== *List of LGBT characters in television ==References== == External links == * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television ","title":"Della Alexander"},{"id":"7794252","text":"Justin von Linde.

The route was turned over to local control in 2010. ==Route description== The highway began at the intersection of Ormsby Boulevard and West King Street (SR 512) in a residential area of western Carson City. From there, the route went north on Ormsby Boulevard through residential areas and fields before curving west. After approximately one mile (1.6 km), the route intersected Winnie Lane. SR 516 followed Winnie Lane north and east from this intersection, passing about through more neighborhoods before ending at North Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 Business/SR 529). ==History== State Route 516 was designated a state highway in 1983. A transfer of ownership of several state highways to Carson City's control was proposed by 2007. The shift in ownership, which included SR 516, was proposed in order to reduce the amount of money the city was supposed to pay to the Nevada Department of Transportation for the construction of the Carson City Freeway (future Interstate 580). State Route 516 was removed from the state highway system by January 2010. ==References== 516 ","title":"Nevada State Route 516"},{"id":"7794307","text":"American singer Gwen Stefani has released four studio albums, one extended play, 29 singles (including eight as a featured artist), four promotional singles, one video album, and 21 music videos. She has sold more than nine million albums as a solo artist. Stefani is also the lead singer of the rock band No Doubt, with which she has released several albums. Stefani began to record solo material in early 2003, and her debut solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was released in November 2004. It debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number seven, and reached multi-platinum status in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The first single released from the album was \\"What You Waiting For?\\", which charted in the top 10 in most of the countries in which it was released. \\"Rich Girl\\" was released as the album's second single, a collaboration with rapper Eve; it was successful on several formats, and reached the top 10 in the UK and the US. The third single \\"Hollaback Girl\\" became Stefani's first US and second Australian number-one single; it was less successful elsewhere. The fourth single \\"Cool\\" was released shortly after but it did not perform as well as its predecessor, failing to reach the top 10 in the US and UK. \\"Luxurious\\" was released as the album's fifth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. \\"Crash\\" was released in early 2006 as the album's sixth single in lieu of Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'s sequel, which was delayed by Stefani's pregnancy. It charted only in the US. Stefani released her second album The Sweet Escape in December 2006; it spawned five singles from October 2006 to October 2007. The album's music contains new wave and dance music influences similar to that of its predecessor, while also exploring more modern pop sounds. The first single released from the album was \\"Wind It Up\\", which peaked in the top 20 in most of the countries in which it was released. The second single, \\"The Sweet Escape\\", featuring rapper Akon, peaked in the top 10 of most charts, reaching number two in the US and UK. \\"4 in the Morning\\" was released as the album's third single; managing a top 30 placement on the US Pop chart but failing to reach the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Although, the single went-on to become a top ten success in Australia and New Zealand. \\"Now That You Got It\\", a hybrid song featuring reggae artist Damian Marley, also had a less than stellar chart performance; it did not make the top 20 anywhere except Norway and failed to chart in the US. The album's fifth and final single, \\"Early Winter\\", was released across only mainland Europe and charted moderately well. On the same day as Stefani released The Sweet Escape, she also released Harajuku Lovers Live on DVD, a recording of a concert performed in November 2005 in Anaheim, California as part of her Harajuku Lovers Tour. In late 2014, Stefani released two non-album singles, \\"Baby Don't Lie\\" on October 20, 2014, and \\"Spark the Fire\\" on December 1, 2014. \\"Baby Don't Lie\\" received moderate success on commercial charts, while \\"Spark the Fire\\" only charted on the Dance Club Songs chart. Stefani was a featured singer on Eminem's single, \\"Kings Never Die\\", which was written specifically for the 2015 film Southpaw. On October 20, 2015, Stefani released the lead single for her third studio album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like, \\"Used to Love You\\". \\"Make Me Like You\\" and \\"Misery\\" were also released from the album. Stefani's fourth album and first Christmas album is You Make It Feel Like Christmas and was preceded by the release of the title track, a duet with Blake Shelton in 2017. All of the album's seventeen songs entered the Holiday Digital Songs chart in the United States. Stefani and Shelton have released three other collaborations together, including \\"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\\" (2016) and \\"Nobody but You\\" (2019), which peaked at numbers 70 and 18 in the United States, respectively. In July 2020, they released \\"Happy Anywhere\\". ==Studio albums== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Certifications - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS * \\"Kings Never Die\\": ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" AUT ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" CAN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" GER ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" NOR ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" NZ ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" SWE ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" SWI ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" Love.

Philipp Ernst Maria Lieber (16 November 1838, Bad Camberg, Duchy of Nassau - 31 March 1902, Bad Camberg) was a German Centre party politician and member of the Reichstag.Ernst Maria Lieber - Catholic Encyclopedia article == Life == Ernst Lieber was the son of the lawyer, politician, and tea merchant Moritz Joseph Josias Lieber. The religious painter Philipp Veit, the Limburg Bishop Peter Joseph Blum and politically influential Bishop of Mainz, Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, were friends of his parents. Lieber earned his Abitur in Hadamar. He studied from 1858 law in Würzburg, Munich, and Bonn. Lieber received his doctorate finally in Heidelberg. After the death of his father in 1863, he interrupted work on his habilitation and supported his mother in the education of his youngest sibling and the family tea trading business. In Camberg he founded a trade association and a Catholic social club. Lieber married on 24 September 1873 Josephine Arnold (1853-1932). From the marriage twelve children were born. Lieber was a member of the Catholic Student Association KDStV Bavaria Bonn. == Work == At the initiative of Bishop Blum, in 1869 Lieber gave his first speech at a Katholikentag (conference of Catholic laity). Later he became one of the founders of the Centre party, which he took over as chair in 1891 after the death of Ludwig Windthorst. He was elected in 1870 to the Prussian House of Representatives and in March 1871 to the first parliament. Both mandates he held until his death. During the Kulturkampf, he distinguished himself as an eloquent opponent of Bismarck, particularly in the debates on the National Sunday rest, the restriction of women, and child labor, and the general working time limit. Following the partial withdrawal of the Kulturkampf laws, the party under his leadership struck a decidedly a national course. Lieber supported in particular the naval bills, by which he supported the politics of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Lieber was politically active in his hometown of Camberg. He was a member of the city council and was temporarily City Council Chairman. He also belonged to the district council and district committee, also the local parliament of the governmental district of Wiesbaden, as well as the county council of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau in Kassel. In Camberg, Ernst Lieber build in 1889 the Lieber'schen tower on an old foundations, in the tower room he received visitors. Lieber was elected President of the Katholikentag in Münster in 1885. == Awards == Pope Leo XIII gave him the Grand Commander's Cross of the Order of St. George and made him a papal chamberlain.

The route originated as State Route 36. It was removed from the state highway system in 2018. ==Route description== View east from the west end of SR 518 State Route 518 began at the intersection of Snyder Avenue and South Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 & U.S. Route 50) in southern Carson City. From there, the route headed southeast along the two-lane Snyder Avenue into lightly populated areas of the city. After a little more than a mile (1.6 km), the state highway came to an end at Jacobsen Way, although Snyder Avenue continues southeast to serve rural areas. Located at the end of former State Route 518 on Snyder Avenue is the State of Nevada's Stewart Complex. Opened in 1890, the facility was operated by the federal government as an Indian boarding school focusing on vocational skills. Originally, students were primarily from the Washo, Paiute and Shoshone Indian tribes, but the center eventually expanded to educate Indian students of all cultures across the United States. The federal government closed the school in 1980, with Nevada officials gradually acquiring the campus over the next several years. The site is now used as a state office and training facility, and is home to the Nevada Indian Commission and the Stewart Indian Museum and Trading Post. ==History== SR 518 was previously designated as State Route 36. SR 518 had been in Nevada's state highway system since at least 1936. By this time, the highway was shown on Nevada maps as State Route 36, a paved road connecting US 395/US 50 to what was then labeled as the Carson Indian School. The route designation stayed the same until July 1, 1976. On that date, Nevada officials began renumbering the state's highways, assigning State Route 518 to the road serving the Stewart school. At their meeting on November 14, 2018, the Nevada Department of Transportation's Board of Directors voted to transfer ownership of SR 518 to Carson City. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Official site of the Stewart Indian School 518 Category:Transportation in Carson City, Nevada ","title":"Nevada State Route 518"},{"id":"7794325","text":"Macedonian cuisine (Greek: Μακεδονική κουζίνα) is the cuisine of the region of Macedonia in northern Greece.

The arrival of Greek refugees from Asia Minor and Constantinople in the early 20th century brought also Anatolian and Constantinopolitan elements in the cuisine of the region. Some current specialties are trahanas with crackling, phyllo-based pies (cheese, leek, spinach) and meat plates (such as pork, wild boar and buffalo). Favourites are tyrokafteri (Macedonian spicy cheese spread) and soupies krasates (cuttlefishes in wine). Unlike Athens, the traditional pita bread for the popular souvlaki usually is not grilled but fried.

The route served the central portion of the city, providing access to several government buildings in the capitol district. It was turned over to local control in 2010. ==Route description== The Nevada Department of Transportation headquarters on Stewart Street (former SR 520) in Carson City State Route 520 began on the southern end of Carson City at a junction with South Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 Business/SR 529) across from the Carson Ranger District office of the U.S. Forest Service. The route turned north from this intersection, passing headquarters for the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, Nevada Department of Public Safety, and Nevada Department of Transportation. Stewart Street runs parallel to the east side of Carson Street as it heads northward. As SR 520 crossed East Fifth Street (SR 513), it entered the downtown district. The stretch from Fifth Street to Musser Street forms the eastern border of the main state capitol complex. In this section, the route passed behind major state buildings such as the Nevada Legislature, the Supreme Court of Nevada, and the Nevada State Capitol. The same segment of road hosts other state institutions like the Nevada State Library and Archives and buildings for the Nevada Department of Education. Crossing over Musser Street, SR 520 moved into more commercial areas of the central city. Small businesses and parking lots line each side of Stewart Street. The route also passed behind a U.S. Department of the Interior building as it continued northward. State Route 520 reached its northern end at the intersection of East William Street (former SR 530) in the center of Carson City, although Stewart Street continued beyond the state highway terminus. ==History== State Route 520 became a signed state route when Nevada renumbered its state highways in 1976. There have been no major changes to the route since its inception. In 2009, a plan was developed that would reduce Carson City's financial contribution towards the construction of the Carson City Bypass (future Interstate 580) in exchange for the Nevada Department of Transportation relinquishing some state-maintained highways to the city. The proposal was modeled after a similar 2008 deal. State Route 520 was deleted from the state highway system on June 24, 2010. ==Major intersections== This table shows major intersections at the time SR 520 was removed from the state highway system. ==References== 520 ","title":"Nevada State Route 520"},{"id":"7794344","text":"Self-portrait (date unknown) Gyula Aggházy (20 March 1850 in Dombóvár - 23 May 1919 in Budapest) was a Hungarian genre painter and art teacher. ==Biography== As a young man, he was equally interested in music and art and, for a short time, played violin at the National Theater.

An integrated order management system may encompass these modules: * Product information (descriptions, attributes, locations, quantities) * Inventory available to promise (ATP) and sourcing * Vendors, purchasing, and receiving * Marketing (catalogs, promotions, pricing) * Customers and prospects * Order entry and customer service (including returns and refunds) * Financial processing (credit cards, billing, payment on account) * Order processing (selection, printing, picking, packing, shipping) There are several business domains which use OMS for different purposes but the core reasons remain the same: # Telecom – To keep track of customers, accounts, credit verification, product delivery, billing, etc. # Retail – Large retail companies use OMS to keep track of orders from customers, stock level maintenance, packaging and shipping and to synchronize orders across various channels such as e.g. if customer order online and pick up in stores # Pharmaceuticals and healthcare # Automotive – to keep track of parts sourced through OEMs # Financial services Order management requires multiple steps in a sequential process like capture, validation, fraud check, payment authorization, sourcing, backorder management, pick, pack, ship and associated customer communications. Order management systems usually have workflow capabilities to manage this process. ==Financial securities== Another use for Order Management Systems is as a software-based platform that facilitates and manages the order execution of securities, typically through the FIX protocol. Order Management Systems, sometimes known in the financial markets as Trade Order Management Systems, are used on both the buy-side and the sell-side, although the functionality provided by buy-side and sell-side OMS differs slightly. Typically only exchange members can connect directly to an exchange, which means that a sell- side OMS usually has exchange connectivity, whereas buy-side an OMS is concerned with connecting to sell-side firms. === Buy-side vs sell-side === An OMS allows firms to input orders to the system for routing to the pre- established destinations. They also allow firms to change, cancel and update orders. When an order is executed on the sell-side, the sell-side OMS must then update its state and send an execution report to the order's originating firm. An OMS should also allow firms to access information on orders entered into the system, including detail on all open orders and on previously completed orders. Sell-side OMS may offer direct market access and support for algorithmic trading. The development of multi-asset functionality is a pressing concern for firms developing OMS software.ATMonitor, In Search of True Multi-Asset Order Management Systems, atmonitor.co.uk, May , 2010 The Order Management System supports Portfolio Management by translating intended Asset Allocation actions into marketable orders for the buy-side. This typically falls into four categories: * Re-balance – The periodic reallocation of a fund's asset allocation / market exposures to correct for market valuation fluctuations and cash flows * Tracking – Periodic adjustment to align an Index Fund or SMA with its target * Discretionary – Adhoc reallocation initiated by Portfolio Managers and Analysts * Tactical Asset Allocation – Reallocation made to capture temporary inefficiencies TAA === How an OMS works === Changes in positional allocation often affect multiple accounts creating hundreds or thousands of small orders, which are typically grouped into aggregate market orders and crossing orders to avoid the legitimate fear of front running. When reallocation involves contradictory operations, trade crossing can sometimes be done. Crossing orders involve moving shares and cash between internal accounts, and then potentially publishing the resulting \\"trade\\" to the listing exchange. Aggregate orders, on the other hand, are traded together. The details of which accounts are participating in the market order are sometimes divulged with the trade (OTC trading) or post-execution (FIX and/or through the settlement process.) In some circumstances, such as equities in the United States, an average price for the aggregate market order can be applied to all of the shares allocated to the individual accounts which participated in the aggregate market order. In other circumstances, such as Futures or Brazilian markets, each account must be allocated specific prices at which the market order is executed. Identifying the price that an account received from the aggregate market order is regulated and scrutinized post-trade process of trade allocation. An additional wrinkle to the trade allocation process is that aggregate market order may not be fully satisfied. If, for example, a limit order is used to control slippage, then it may take weeks to fully implement a discretionary asset allocation change. This adds a participation fairness issue in trade allocation in addition to price fairness. The two aspects are compound since the market may move against your position under the pressure of your large pending aggregate market order (even if implemented as a dark-pool Program Trade.) Some Order Management Systems go a step further in their trade allocation process by providing tax lot assignment. Because investment managers are graded on unrealized profit & loss, but the investor needs to pay capital gains on realized profit & loss; it is often beneficial for the investor that the exact share/contract uses in a closing trade be carefully chosen. For example, selling older shares rather than newly acquired shares may reduce the effective tax rate. This information does not need to be finalized until capital gains are to be paid or until taxes are to be filed, OMS tax lot assignments are considered usually tentative. The tax lot assignments remade or recorded within the Accounting System are considered definitive. === Compliance === An OMS is a data-rich source of information which is able to communicate to the front and back office systems (or modules in the case of a single platform software). Prices, number of shares, volumes, date, time, financial instrument, share class, exchange are all key data values which allows the asset/investment manager to maintain an accurate and true positional view of their portfolio ensures all investment guidelines are met and any potential breaches are avoided or resolved in a timely manner. Guidelines between the investor and investment manager are stated in the Investment Policy Statement, IPS, and can be understood as constraints on the asset allocation of the portfolio to ensure the manager does not drift from the stated investment strategy over time at an attempt of TAA. For example, an agreed guideline may include a set portion of the portfolio should constitute of cash and cash equivalents to maintain liquidity levels. === Reporting === An outcome of an OMS successfully communicating to an asset manager's systems is the ease of producing accurate and timely reporting. All data can be seamlessly interpreted to create valuable information about the portfolio's performance and composition, as well as investment activities, fees and cash flows to a granular level. As investors are demanding increasingly detailed and frequent reporting, an asset manager can benefit from the correct set up of an OMS to deliver information whilst focusing on core activities. Increasing financial regulations are also causing managers to allocate more resources to ensure firstly, they are able to obtain the correct data on their trades and then they are compliant to the new metrics. For example, if a predetermined percent of the portfolio can hold a certain asset class or risk exposure to the asset class or market, the investment manager must be able to report this was satisfied during the reporting period. ==Types== Order management systems can be standalone systems like Multiorders or modules of an ERP system such as Megaventory, Ordoro, Fishbowl or Cloud Commerce Pro. Another difference is whether the system is an on-premises software or a cloud-based software. Their basic difference is that the on-premises ERP solutions are installed locally on a company's own computers and servers and managed by their own IT staff, while a cloud software is hosted on the vendor's servers and accessed through a web browser. Order management systems for financial securities can also be used as a standalone system or modules of a PMS system such as HedgeGuard or Bloomberg's AIM, to process trade orders simultaneously across a number of funds, the IT infrastructure lowers operational risk. ==See also== * Execution management system * Order fulfillment * Purchase order * Sales order ==References== __FORCETOC__ Category:Enterprise resource planning terminology Category:Electronic trading systems ","title":"Order management system"},{"id":"7794378","text":"The Custody of Infants Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict. c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was signed into law on 24 April 1873. Section 1 allowed the Court of Chancery to order that a mother would have access to, or custody of, any infants under sixteen years of age; or to order that any such infants in her custody were to remain so subject to any regulations for the access of the father or guardian.The companion to the British almanac, for the year 1874, p. 229.

Section 2 provided that no agreement in a deed of separation between the father and mother was to be held invalid simply for providing that the custody or control of the children lay with the mother, with the important caveat that no court was bound to enforce any such agreement if it felt it would not be to the benefit of the infant.

Its surrounding neighborhoods include Ingleside to the west, Mission Terrace to the north, Excelsior to the northeast, Crocker-Amazon to the southeast, and Daly City to the southwest. The name Outer Mission often causes confusion, leading some to believe that Outer Mission is immediately south of Mission District (in reality, Bernal Heights is directly south of Mission). Some call any and all neighborhoods south of Mission the \\"Outer Mission area,\\" which results in further confusion. ==History== The Outer Mission was developed around the 1910s as an extension of the nearby Mission District. The area was serviced by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Before the area was developed it largely consisted of farms, providing the city with Swiss chard and potatoes. Like the Mission, many of its original residents were of Irish and Italian descent. ==Attractions and characteristics== The neighborhood is near Cayuga Park and playground, a unique park beneath the BART tracks, featuring dense vegetation and over 100 whimsical wood statues carved by the park's creator, along with a small baseball field and tennis courts. Most of the area contains single-family residences that are often attached and have a small fenced back yard. The 1990s to 2000s housing bubble and its subsequent gentrification led to many Latino/Chicano and Asian/Filipino families to move into the area: It remains one of the few low-rent and middle class enclaves in San Francisco. Due to this shift in demographics, a very common practice in this neighborhood is the construction of an in-law apartment in part of the garage space (often consisting of an additional bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, with the side entry used as the in-law's door). The owner of the building then often rents out this in-law unit to supplement his or her income or mortgage payment. Because of this, there is a relatively high percentage of renters in this neighborhood, despite consisting almost exclusively of single family homes. The in-laws very often are unwarranted (done without a city permit), resulting in a higher population density than the neighborhood was built for or the city would allow. This has some undesirable side effects such as the streets (and even the sidewalks) filling up with cars. Outer Mission houses originally featured front yards or small planting areas in front of the property. Over the years, many homeowners paved over their planting areas, to allow them to park cars on the sidewalk. This has made the streets less attractive; as the city has recently encouraged residents to (re-)create planting areas and plant trees in front of their homes, front yards are on the rise again. The neighborhood is well served by public transportation and is adjacent to the I-280, one of San Francisco's two major freeways. The BART line through the city runs adjacent to the Outer Mission. As the tracks are above-ground, the trains are visible and audible throughout most of the neighborhood. The neighborhood is in walking distance to Balboa Park Station, which is one of the city's largest public transportation hubs, being served by BART, three Muni Metro lines (J-Church, K-Ingleside, M-Oceanview) and many bus lines (including some of the nightly Owl lines). The main bus line serving the Outer Mission is the 14 Mission: The bus line operates along the full length of Mission Street (from the Embarcadero to Daly City). In addition to the 14, during peak hours, Muni runs two variations: the 14-R (rapid, fewer stops) and the 14-X (express, takes the freeway to and from downtown). During peak hours, the 88 BART Shuttle Muni line passes through the Outer Mission and can be used to get to Balboa Park quickly and directly. Finally, the numerous bus lines that run along Geneva Avenue (most prominently the 8x, the 54 and the 43) are easily accessible from the neighborhood. In addition to Muni, SamTrans operates several of its lines on Mission Street which can be used to get to destinations on the Peninsula. While bicycling is not as widespread as in other neighborhoods (such as the Mission), it is popular with some residents. Well marked and wide bike lanes exist along most of Alemany Blvd. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in San Francisco ","title":"Outer Mission, San Francisco"},{"id":"7794411","text":"Dónall Peadar Mac Amhlaigh (10 December 1926 - 27 January 1989) was an Irish writer active during the 20th century. A native of County Galway, he is best known for his Irish-language works about life as a labourer in the post-Second World War-era, as part of the Irish diaspora in Britain. His first book, Dialann Deoraí, is his most widely known and has been translated into English under the title \\"An Irish Navvy: The Diary of an Exile\\". ==Biography== He was born on the Cappagh Road between Galway and the nearby village of Bearna and in 1940 moved with his family to Kilkenny. At birth he was registered under the name Daniel Peter McCauley. His father was James McCauley, from Kinvara, a soldier in the National Army of the Irish Free State. James had originally been a member of the Irish Republican Army and fought in the Irish War of Independence. His mother was Mary Condon. He left school at 15 to go out to work in a woollen mill and later on farms and in hotels in the West of Ireland. In 1947 he joined the Irish-speaking regiment of the Irish Army. When he left it in 1951 he faced the prospect of unemployment in Ireland. He travelled to Northampton, England to work as an unskilled labourer. He worked in the construction industry as a navvy, working on roads from Milton Keynes to Coventry, such as the M1 motorway and M6 motorway. He later became a writer, producing a number of novels and short stories as well as social history. He was also a prolific journalist. As a committed socialist, he contributed regularly to newspapers and journals in Ireland and England throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He was a member of the Connolly Association and was a founding member of the Northampton-branch of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Although not a native speaker, he wrote extensively in the Irish language. His first book was Dialann Deoraí, an account of his life as a building worker in England. It was an immediate best-seller and was published in an English translation by the poet Valentin Iremonger (An Irish Navvy: The Diary of an Exile, 1964). Another book, the novel Deoraithe (1986), covered similar ground, with a hero who tries to make a living in the Ireland of the 1950s and on the building sites of England. He died on the way to give a lecture in London in 1989. He was buried at Kingsthorpe cemetery in Northampton. 53 volumes of his diaries and literary notebooks from 1950 - 1988 are held in the National Library of Ireland. Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaidh, off the Cappagh Road in Galway, is named after him. ==Bibliography== *Dialann Deoraí [Diary of an Exile], with a foreword by Niall Ó Dónaill.

It stars Paydin LoPachin, Rocky Marquette, Katie Chonacas and Brian Krause. ==Plot== In a hotel in Hollywood California, a young lady (Dagmar Peterson) is a down and out ventriloquist who can't find work anymore. She is also a drug addict. One night the hotel manager comes in and tells her she has to pay the rent tomorrow or her and her two kids, Angelina and Norbert, will be thrown out. The mother doesn't know what to do, so she drugs herself again, this time killing her. The Dummy (Bruce Weitz) watches and wakes up Angelina and Norbert from sleep. The Dummy tells them that it is now the three of them. Later on, Angelina, Norbert, and the Dummy are sent to their perverted uncle's house. The uncle (Fred Cameron) ends up abusing Angelina and the Dummy is not happy. While the uncle is sleeping, Dummy suffocates him. Dummy is then put in a suitcase for several years. He is then taken out to see Angelina (Paydin LoPachin) and Norbert (Rocky Marquette) all grown up. Dummy is used to talk for Norbert (He was in shock when he saw his mother died). On Halloween night, Dummy ends up killing a young kid for not believing Norbert is not a magic Triloquist. Angelina ends up blaming Norbert for cutting off the boy's fingers. Norbert is taking away and Angelina and Dummy have to break him out. Angelina and Dummy end up working at a strip club, killing the manager (Andrew Zak) for not letting Angelina do a ventriloquist act. Taking his car, Angelina ends up going after Norbert. When the doctor won't let Norbert leave, Dummy ends up having to kill another person, this time a worker. Norbert and Dummy reunite with Angelina with a \\"group hug\\". Angelina, Norbert, and Dummy head down to Vegas so Norbert can do his ventriloquist act. While eating at a restaurant, Angelina reveals that if Norbert doesn't have a son, their triloquist name would die out. Angelina thinks that a girl named Robin Patterson (Katie Chonacas) would be the perfect mother. They end up kidnapping Robin and place her in the trunk of the car. While on the road, they are stopped by the police again. He sees Robin tied up and Angelina ends up shooting him with a gun. Back on the road, they stop help out another man with car trouble. They end up robbing him and killing him. They stop at a gas station and Dummy thinks it would be a perfect time to ditch Angelina and be free. Norbert refuses and Angelina comes back hearing Dummy and throwing him out of the car. Angelina and Dummy agree not to leave each other. Angelina gives Dummy back to Norbert. The police show up and Angelina tries to blame Norbert again. They take Norbert and Angelina into the car and rescue Robin. While driving in the police car, Robin reveals to the officer (Brian Krause) that Norbert never said a word. When they realize that an officer has been killed, Angelina kills the officer that rescued Robin. They take her to a cabin and Norbert is to get her pregnant and hopefully have a son. When Robin talks Dummy and Norbert into letting her use the phone, Angelina shows up and shoves Robin into a room and Norbert ties her up. Angelina decides to punish Dummy by having Dummy set his tongue on fire with a match. Later on, Angelina says that they should go to Vegas and leave the dummy behind. The Next Morning, a janitor comes into the cabin and finds Robin, who ends up dead by Dummy who rides him like a horse (choking him in the process) Angelina and Norbert discover that they are being followed by the police. Angelina decides to kill Robin in the woods and head to Vegas. That night, Angelina, Norbert, Dummy, and Robin end up in the woods. Robin begins to bury her grave when she escapes into an old DJ room. Robin finds Detective Shane Kinslow (the person who saved her) dead. Angelina, Norbert, and Dummy show up again. Angelina says that Norbert should rape Robin and get her pregnant. Before Norbert could, Robin reveals that she is in love with him. Being tricked, Robin takes a knife and stabs Dummy. While trying to escape, Robin is knocked out by Angelina. Angelina reveals that she made up the triloquist act and that she has been doing the voice of Dummy. Furious, Norbert attempts to kill Angelina. But Angelina pushes Norbert into cables and is shocked to death. Still alive, Norbert starts talking for the first time to Dummy that he is dying. Waking up, Robin finally escapes. When Angelina takes Dummy outside, Norbert tries to kill Angelina, but ends up getting stabbed by a knife. Dying, Norbert ask is Dummy could sing to him, Dummy accepts and sings to Norbert. When Norbert dies, Dummy does too. Robin is able to find help and shows the police where she was attacked. When they arrive, Dummy and Angelina are gone leaving Norbert's dead body lying there. Robin reveals that they got magic and are heading to Vegas. Dummy reveals that Angelina got to depressed and never became a star in Vegas. Angelina figures out the she is pregnant with Norbert's baby, she gives birth to the baby in the hotel from the beginning, and dies after. Dummy (still alive) holds the baby boy like a proud papa.

Proctor (May 5, 1901 – September 24, 1959) was an American food scientist who was involved in early research on food irradiation. ==Early life== A native of Malden, Massachusetts, Proctor graduated from Malden High in 1919, then graduated with an S.B. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1923. He would then earn his Ph.D. at MIT in 1927. ==MIT career== After earning his Ph.D. in 1927 from MIT, Proctor went to work as an instructor in the biology and public health department at the Institute. Proctor would be appointed to assistant professor of food technology in 1930, associate professor in 1937, professor in 1944, and department chair in 1952. Proctor would serve as chair until his sudden death in his office on September 24, 1959. During his career at MIT, Proctor worked on the application of food irradiation with Samuel A. Goldblith and Daniel F. Farkas, both of whom were graduate students under Proctor at MIT. Goldblith would later work with Proctor on the MIT faculty until Proctor's 1959 death. Proctor and his boss at MIT, Samuel Cate Prescott, would also publish the first book on food science in 1937 entitled Food Technology, published by McGraw-Hill. Proctor also served as director of Subsistence Research of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps in Washington, DC during World War II. ==Formation of the Institute of Food Technologists== As food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the slaughterhouse for meat and poultry processing, the cannery for canned foods, and bakeries for bread as examples, the need to have personnel trained for the food industries. Literature such as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later that year. The United States Department of Agriculture was also interested in food technology and research was also being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of California, Berkeley. By 1935, both Prescott and Proctor decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this. A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President Compton in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 to July 2, 1937 with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with \\"fifty or sixty people.\\" 500 people actually attended the event. This meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by George J. Hucker of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (part of Cornell University) in Geneva, New York, a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this. The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session Fred C. Blanck of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the Institute of Food Technologists. This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, Roy C. Newton of Swift & Company in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer. By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members. Proctor was one of the charter members of IFT, serving as president in 1952-3. He would also win the Nicholas Appert Award in 1956 and would play a major role in the IFT Committee on Education's 1958 Allerton House conference in Monticello, Illinois that would lead to the first IFT undergraduate education standards in 1966. ==Death and legacy== Proctor died in his office in 1959. He was survived by his wife, the former Miriam H. Patten. Led by Farkas, the IFT Food Engineering Division would create the Bernard E. Proctor Lectureship which was first held in 1996, but has been held in odd-numbered years since 1999. In even-numbered years since 2000, the Proctor Lectureship has been held in conjunction with the Marcel Loncin Research Prize.Institute of Food Technologists Food Engineering Division Bernard E.

All forms involve the pulling of the spinal cord at the base of the spinal canal, literally a tethered cord. The spinal cord normally hangs loose in the canal, free to move up and down with growth, and with bending and stretching. A tethered cord, however, is held taut at the end or at some point in the spinal canal. In children, a tethered cord can force the spinal cord to stretch as they grow. In adults the spinal cord stretches in the course of normal activity, usually leading to progressive spinal cord damage if untreated. TCS is often associated with the closure of a spina bifida. It can be congenital, such as in tight filum terminale, or the result of injury later in life. ==Signs and symptoms== In children, symptoms may include: *Lesions, hairy patches, dimples, or fatty tumours on the lower back * Foot and spinal deformities * Weakness in the legs (loss of muscle strength and tone) * Change in or abnormal gait including awkwardness while running or wearing the tips or side of one shoe * Low back pain * Scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine to the left or right) * Urinary irregularities (incontinence or retention) Tethered spinal cord syndrome may go undiagnosed until adulthood, when sensory, motor, bowel, and bladder control issues emerge. This delayed presentation of symptoms relates to the degree of strain on the spinal cord over time. Tethering may also develop after spinal cord injury. Scar tissue can block the flow of fluids around the spinal cord. Fluid pressure may cause cysts to form in the spinal cord, a condition called syringomyelia. This can lead to additional loss of movement or feeling, or the onset of pain or autonomic nervous system symptoms. In adults, onset of symptoms typically include: * Severe pain (in the lower back and radiating into the legs, groin, and perineum) * Bilateral muscle weakness and numbness * Loss of feeling and movement in lower extremities * Urinary irregularities (incontinence or retention) * Bowel control issues Neurological symptoms can include a mixed picture of upper and lower motor neuron findings, such as amyotrophy, hyperreflexia, and pathologic plantar response, occurring in the same limb. Profound sensory changes, such as loss of pain, temperature, and proprioceptive sensations, are common. Last, progressive symptoms of a neuropathic bladder are noted on over 70% of adult patients, versus only 20% to 30% of children. These symptoms include urinary frequency and urgency, feeling of incomplete voiding, poor voluntary control, and urge and stress incontinence. Chronic recurrent infections are common and occasionally lead to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), kidney failure, or kidney transplantation. Female patients also give a history of ineffective labor and postpartum rectal prolapse, presumably due to an atonic pelvic floor. === Related disorders === * Kyphosis * Brain herniation * Spina Bifida * Ehlers-Danlos syndrome * Klippel-Feil syndrome ==Cause== Tethered spinal cord can be caused by various conditions but the main cause is when tissue attachments limit the movement of the spinal cord in the spinal column which causes abnormal stretching of the cord. The tethered spinal cord syndrome is correlated with having the causes: * Spina bifida ** Occulta ** Mylomeningocele ** Meningocele * History of spinal trauma * History of spinal surgery * Tumor(s) in the spinal column * Thickened and/or tight filum terminale * Lipoma(s) in the spinal column * Dermal Sinus Tract (congenital deformity) * Diastematomyelia (split spinal cord) Tethered spinal cord is a disorder and not a mechanism so it does not spread to other people and there are no measures that can be done to prevent it beforehand. The only preventative measure that is successful is to surgically untether the spinal cord though there might already be irreversible damage. === Spina bifida === In tethered spinal cord cases spina bifida can be accompanied by tethering of the spinal cord but in rare cases with Spina bifida occulta. Tethering of the spinal cord tends to occur in the cases of Spina bifida with mylomeningocele. In most people the spine grows faster than the spinal cord during development which causes the end of the spinal cord to appear to rise relative to the bony spine next to it. By the time of birth the spinal cord is located between L1 and L2. In a baby with Spina bifida the spinal cord is still attached to the skin around it preventing it from rising properly. This occurs because the spinal cord in a child with Spina bifida is low lying and tethered at the bottom. At the time of birth the mylomeningocele is separated from the skin but the spinal cord is still stuck in the same place. As the child begins to grow the spinal cord remains in the same place becoming stretched out causing the tight cord and the tethering at the end. With this type of tethering there is an interference with the blood supply to the nerves and body which can then cause the deterioration of the body causing orthopedic, neurological, and urological problems. With milder forms of Spina bifida such as Occulta, may be related to the degree of strain on the cord which can become worse with physical activity, injury, pregnancy, bone spurs, or spinal stenosis. The tethered cord in this case might not be diagnosed until adulthood when it worsens and can still cause neurological, orthopedic, and urological dysfunctions. == Mechanism == Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a clinical entity which is manifested by progressive motor and sensory changes in: * legs * incontinence * back of leg pain * scoliosis In order to understand the pathophysiology that is involved in a tethered spinal cord, the reduction/oxidation ratio has to be used in vivo of cytochrome alpha and alpha 3 to signal the oxidative metabolic functioning in humans. Studies have found that marked metabolic and electrophysiological susceptibility to hypoxic stress to the lumbar and sacral portion of the spinal cord under traction with various weights. Similar effects were found in redox behavior of tethered spinal cord during the surgical procedures to repair it. This can be due to impairment of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism under constant or intermittent stretching. The act of prolonged stretching can lead to structural damage to the neural perikarya and eventually the axons in neurons. The untethering process can improve the oxidative metabolism and can help to repair injured neurons. == Diagnosis == For children younger than eight weeks of age (and possibly in utero), a tethered cord may be observed using ultrasonography. Ultrasonography may still be useful through age 5 in limited circumstances. MRI imaging appears to be the gold standard for diagnosing a tethered cord. A tethered cord is often diagnosed as a \\"low conus.\\" The conus medullaris (or lower termination of the spinal cord) normally terminates at or above the L1-2 disk space (where L1 is the first, or topmost lumbar vertebra). After about 3 months of age, a conus below the L1-2 disk space may indicate a tethered cord and termination below L3-4 is unmistakably tethered. \\"Cord tethering is often assumed when the conus is below the normal L2-3 level. TCS, however, is a clinical diagnosis that should be based on \\"neurological and musculoskeletal signs and symptoms. Imaging features are in general obtained to support rather than make the diagnosis.\\" Clinical evaluation may include a simple rectal examination and may also include invasive or non-invasive urological examination. \\"Bladder dysfunction occurs in ~40% of patients affected by tethered cord syndrome. ... [I]t may be the earliest sign of the syndrome.\\" ==Treatment== Because neurological deficits are generally irreversible, early surgery is recommended when symptoms begin to worsen. In children, early surgery is recommended to prevent further neurological deterioration, including but not limited to chronic urinary incontinence. In adults, surgery to detether (free) the spinal cord can reduce the size and further development of cysts in the cord and may restore some function or alleviate other symptoms. Although detethering is the common surgical approach to TCS, another surgical option for adults is a spine-shortening vertebral osteotomy. A vertebral osteotomy aims to indirectly relieve the excess tension on the spinal cord by removing a portion of the spine, shortening it. This procedure offers a unique benefit in that the spinal cord remains fixated to the spine, preventing retethering and spinal cord injury as possible surgical complications. However, its complexity and limited “track record” presently keeps vertebral osteotomies reserved as an option for patients who have failed in preventing retethering after detethering procedure(s). Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Medications such as NSAIDs, opiates, synthetic opiates, COX-2 inhibitors, and off-label applications of tricyclic antidepressants combined with anti-seizure compounds have yet to prove they are of value in treatment of this affliction's pain manifestations. There is anecdotal evidence that TENS units may benefit some patients. Treatment may be needed in adults who, while previously asymptomatic, begin to experience pain, lower back degeneration, scoliosis, neck and upper back problems and bladder control issues. Surgery on adults with minimal symptoms is somewhat controversial. For example, a website from the Columbia University Department of Neurosurgery says, \\"For the child that has reached adult height with minimal if any symptoms, some neurosurgeons would advocate careful observation only.\\" However, surgery for those who have worsening symptoms is less controversial. If the only abnormality is a thickened, shortened filum, then a limited lumbosacral laminectomy with division of the filum may be sufficient to relieve the symptoms. This syndrome was first noticed in the late 19th century. While information has been available for years, little widespread blind research has been done. More research has been called for, and doctors have conducted many studies with good results. There is a low morbidity rate, and no complications have been documented other than those typical of any type of back surgery. The association of this condition with others has been noticed, and needs further research to understand such relationships. TCS is causally linked to Chiari malformation and any affirmative diagnosis of TCS must be followed by screening for Chiari's several degrees. TCS may also be related to Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, or Klippel–Feil syndrome, which should also be screened for upon a positive TCS diagnosis. Spinal compression and the resulting relief is a known issue with this disorder. Like with the early- onset form, this disease form is linked to the Arnold–Chiari malformation, in which the brain is pulled or lowers into the top of the spine. ==Prognosis== The disorder progresses with age, but the aforementioned treatments can help prevent or sometimes relieve symptoms. With treatment, individuals with tethered spinal cord syndrome have a normal life expectancy. However, most neurological and motor impairments are irreversible. ==References== == External links == *National institute of Health page Category:Spinal cord disorders ","title":"Tethered spinal cord syndrome"},{"id":"7794475","text":"Stalag XI-C Bergen-Belsen, initially called Stalag 311, was a German Army prisoner-of-war camp located near the town of Bergen in Lower Saxony. ==Timeline== * May 1940: The camp was built to house Belgian and French enlisted men captured in the Battle of France; initial count: 600. * July 1941: About 20,000 Soviet prisoners captured during Operation Barbarossa arrived.

Her paternal grandparents were King Alfonso IX of León and Queen Berengaria of Castile. She married her first cousin-once removed Sancho in 1282, although the matrimonial dispensation for kinship was not previously granted. Upon the death of his father, Alfonso X, the couple became king and queen of Castile and León. She was crowned alongside her husband in the cathedral of Toledo. Although the couple was pressured to separate by Rome and others, Sancho chose to honor his wife and delegated many responsibilities to her, including the regency of their son after his death. His reign was short since he died in 1295. ==First regency== Coat of Arms as Queen of Castile After the death of Sancho IV, he was succeeded by their eldest son Ferdinand IV, who was under age. Though according to the Crónica de Sancho IV, Sancho designated María as the sole regent, she was forced to share the regency with Sancho's uncle, Henry the Senator, younger brother of Alfonso X. Ferdinand's rule was challenged by a coalition that included his uncle, John, his cousins the infantes de la Cerda, sons of the infante Ferdinand de la Cerda, eldest son of Alfonso X, as well as King James II of Aragón and King Denis of Portugal. Through marriage alliances, gifts of territories, and shrewd politics María was able to lead Ferdinand's cause to victory, though it did not come easily. María built her own coalition, relying on the Castilian Cortes to confirm her authority and playing the powerful family of Haro against the Laras, who supported the opposition. Civil war continued for several years, and María's coregent Henry was often more of an antagonist than a defender of his great-nephew's cause. Around 1300, the alliance against Ferdinand began to crumble when one of his principal enemies, Juan Núñez de Lara, was captured and later reconciled to the young king. Portugal returned to allegiance with Ferdinand with the promise of a marriage between the Portuguese princess Constance and the young king of Castile. María's victory for her son seemed sealed in 1301, when she finally received a papal bull from Pope Boniface VIII, legitimizing her marriage and her children. Eventually, only Aragon was left to support the claim of Alfonso de la Cerda and his brother, which was finally set aside in a treaty between Castile and Aragon a few years later. María's son died in 1312 and was succeeded by his son, Alfonso XI. As the new king was a minor, Maria became regent again.

This kind of liability typically has a long and predetermined life on a company's balance sheet, and hence, as mentioned, it is valued via DCF. The accretion expense amounts to a change in the liability due to time and the discount rate applied. In general, it is not to be expected that a company's statement dates will coincide with the anniversary dates of these commitments.

Ross in 2002.Steven J. Ross. The Spreadsort High-performance General-case Sorting Algorithm. Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications, Volume 3, pp. 1100-1106\\\\. Las Vegas Nevada. 2002. It combines concepts from distribution- based sorts, such as radix sort and bucket sort, with partitioning concepts from comparison sorts such as quicksort and mergesort. In experimental results it was shown to be highly efficient, often outperforming traditional algorithms such as quicksort, particularly on distributions exhibiting structure and string sorting. There is an open-source implementation with performance analysis and benchmarks, and HTML documentation . Quicksort identifies a pivot element in the list and then partitions the list into two sublists, those elements less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. Spreadsort generalizes this idea by partitioning the list into n/c partitions at each step, where n is the total number of elements in the list and c is a small constant (in practice usually between 4 and 8 when comparisons are slow, or much larger in situations where they are fast). It uses distribution-based techniques to accomplish this, first locating the minimum and maximum value in the list, and then dividing the region between them into n/c equal-sized bins. Where caching is an issue, it can help to have a maximum number of bins in each recursive division step, causing this division process to take multiple steps. Though this causes more iterations, it reduces cache misses and can make the algorithm run faster overall. In the case where the number of bins is at least the number of elements, spreadsort degenerates to bucket sort and the sort completes. Otherwise, each bin is sorted recursively. The algorithm uses heuristic tests to determine whether each bin would be more efficiently sorted by spreadsort or some other classical sort algorithm, then recursively sorts the bin. Like other distribution-based sorts, spreadsort has the weakness that the programmer is required to provide a means of converting each element into a numeric key, for the purpose of identifying which bin it falls in. Although it is possible to do this for arbitrary-length elements such as strings by considering each element to be followed by an infinite number of minimum values, and indeed for any datatype possessing a total order, this can be more difficult to implement correctly than a simple comparison function, especially on complex structures. Poor implementation of this value function can result in clustering that harms the algorithm's relative performance. == Performance == The worst-case performance of spreadsort is O(n log n) for small data sets, as it uses introsort as a fallback. In the case of distributions where the size of the key in bits k times 2 is roughly the square of the log of the list size n or smaller (2k < (log n)2), it does better in the worst case, achieving O(n ) worst-case time for the originally published version, and O(n·((k/s) + s)) for the cache aware version. For many real sorting problems with over 1000 items, including string sorting, this asymptotic worst-case is better than O(n log n). Experiments were done comparing an optimized version of spreadsort to the highly optimized C++ \`std::sort\`, implemented with introsort. On lists of integers and floats spreadsort shows a roughly 2–7× runtime improvement for random data on various operating systems. In space performance, spreadsort is worse than most in-place algorithms: in its simplest form, it is not an in- place algorithm, using O(n) extra space; in experiments, about 20% more than quicksort using a c of 4–8. With a cache-aware form (as included in Boost.Sort), less memory is used and there is an upper bound on memory usage of the maximum bin count times the maximum number of recursions, which ends up being a few kilobytes times the size of the key in bytes. Although it uses asymptotically more space than the O(log n) overhead of quicksort or the O(1) overhead of heapsort, it uses considerably less space than the basic form of mergesort, which uses auxiliary space equal to the space occupied by the list. == Implementation == unsigned RoughLog2(DATATYPE input) { unsigned char cResult = 0; // The && is necessary on some compilers to avoid infinite loops; it doesn't // significantly impair performance if (input >= 0) while ((input >> cResult) && (cResult < DATA_SIZE)) cResult++; else while (((input >> cResult) < -1) && (cResult < DATA_SIZE)) cResult++; return cResult; } SIZETYPE GetMaxCount(unsigned logRange, unsigned uCount) { unsigned logSize = RoughLog2Size(uCount); unsigned uRelativeWidth = (LOG_CONST * logRange)/((logSize > MAX_SPLITS) ?

This result can be obtained by forcing Spreadsort to always iterate one more time if the bin size after the first iteration is above some constant value. If the key density function is known to be Riemann integrable and bounded, this modification of Spreadsort can attain some performance improvement over the basic algorithm, and will have better worst-case performance. If this restriction cannot usually be depended on, this change will add a little extra runtime overhead to the algorithm and gain little. Other similar algorithms are Flashsort (which is simpler) and Adaptive Left Radix. Adaptive Left Radix is apparently quite similar, the main difference being recursive behavior, with Spreadsort checking for worst-case situations and using std::sort to avoid performance problems where necessary, and Adaptive Left Radix recursing continuously until done or the data is small enough to use insertion sort. == References == Category:Sorting algorithms ","title":"Spreadsort"},{"id":"7794588","text":"Text simplification is an operation used in natural language processing to modify, enhance, classify or otherwise process an existing corpus of human- readable text in such a way that the grammar and structure of the prose is greatly simplified, while the underlying meaning and information remains the same. Text simplification is an important area of research, because natural human languages ordinarily contain large vocabularies and complex compound constructions that are not easily processed through automation. In terms of reducing language diversity, semantic compression can be employed to limit and simplify a set of words used in given texts. == Example == Text Simplification is illustrated with an example from Siddharthan (2006). The first sentence contains two relative clauses and one conjoined verb phrase. A text simplification system aims to simplify the first sentence to the second sentence. * Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold. * Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents. The Chicago report precedes the full purchasing agents report. The Chicago report gives an indication of what the full report might hold. The full report is due out today. One approach to text simplification is lexical simplification via lexical substitution, a two-step process consisting of identifying complex words and replacing them with simpler synonyms. A key challenge here is identifying complex words, which is performed by a machine learning classifier trained on labelled data. An improvement over classical methods of applying binary labels to words as simple or complex is to ask labellers to sort words in order of complexity; this results in higher consistency of resultant labels. == See also == *Automated paraphrasing *Controlled natural language *Lexical simplification *Lexical substitution *Semantic compression *Text normalization *Simplified English *Basic English == References == * Wei Xu, Chris Callison- Burch and Courtney Napoles. \\"Problems in Current Text Simplification Research\\".

Lindsey was laid down as DD-771 as a on 12 September 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Company, San Pedro, California and launched on 5 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Eugene E. Lindsey, widow of Lt. Comdr. Lindsey. The ship was reclassified DM-32 on 19 July 1944 and commissioned on 20 August 1944, Commander T. E. Chambers in command. ==Service history== After shakedown off southern California, the new destroyer minelayer sailed from San Francisco on 25 November 1944 via Pearl Harbor for Ulithi, arriving on 3 February 1945. Underway from Ulithi on the morning of 8 February, Lindsey steamed toward Iwo Jima. Operating off Iwo Jima from 17 to 19 February, Lindsey knocked out six guns ashore and provided covering fire as minesweepers cleared the harbor. On 23 February, she returned to Ulithi to prepare for landings on Okinawa. View of extensive damage to the ship's forward hull and superstructure, received when she was struck by two kamikaze planes off Okinawa on 12 April 1945. Underway 19 March, Lindsey arrived off Okinawa on 24 March and swept the harbor for the inbound transports. Then, as the Marines gained a foothold, the ship bombarded Japanese gun installations and transferred wounded soldiers to hospital ships. On the afternoon of 12 April, Lindsey experienced a mass kamikaze attack. Her gunners scored repeated hits on seven onrushing dive bombers, but two Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" bombers, damaged and out of control, crashed into Lindsey killing 57 sailors and wounding 57 more. The explosion from the second \\"Val\\" ripped some off her bow. Only the “all back full” ordered by Commander Chambers prevented the pressure of inrushing water from collapsing the fireroom bulkhead and sinking the ship. Towed to Kerama Retto the same night, Lindsey remained in the lagoon for two weeks repairing battle damage. On 28 April she departed under tow for Guam, where, after arrival 6 May, she received a temporary bow. She sailed under her own power 8 July for the east coast via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia on 19 August 1945. After extensive repairs at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Lindsey steamed 6 March 1946 for Charleston, South Carolina, and arrived the next day. Lindsey decommissioned 25 May 1946 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1970. Lindsey received two battle stars for World War II.

The improper interpretation of this gap may lead to blood pressure monitoring errors: namely, an underestimation of systolic blood pressure and/or an overestimation of diastolic blood pressure. In order to correct for an auscultatory gap the radial pulse should be monitored by palpation. It is therefore recommended to palpate and auscultate when manually recording a patient's blood pressure. Typically the blood pressure obtained via palpation is around 10 mmHg lower than the pressure obtained via auscultation. In general, the examiner can avoid being confused by an auscultatory gap by always inflating a blood pressure cuff to 20-40 mmHg higher than the pressure required to occlude the brachial pulse. There is evidence that auscultatory gaps are related to carotid atherosclerosis and to increased arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients, independent of age. Another cause is believed to be venous congestion within the limb that is being used for the measurement. Although these observations need to be confirmed prospectively, they suggest that auscultatory gaps may have prognostic relevance. ==References== Category:Blood pressure ","title":"Auscultatory gap"},{"id":"7794684","text":"Rakomelo ( (or racomelo) from raki (ρακή) + meli (μέλι), meaning honey) is a Greek mixed alcoholic drink.

The name was taken on by someone who worked as a caterer. The surname Cater was official name, \\"the cater\\", derived from the Old French ale catour, a little meaning a buyer of groceries for the gentleman's house. They were in charge of maintaining provisions in minors and castles. The cater's job assumed a great importance during extended sieges of his lord's castle, which could last for years. English: occupational name for the buyer of provisions for a large household, from a reduced form of Anglo-Norman French acatour (Late Latin acceptator, an agent derivative of acceptare ‘to accept’). Modern English caterer results from the addition of a second agent suffix to the word. Slovenian (Cater): status name for a person who read out the Slovenian ceremonial text at the installation of the Carantanian rulers and, later, Carinthian dukes, derived from the dialect verb catiti ‘to read’. Carantania was the early medieval Slovenian state on the territory of present-day Carinthia and Styria, now divided between Austria and Slovenia. The people's installation of the Carantanian rulers was an exceptional example of democratic elections in medieval Europe. Thomas Jefferson knew about it and was influenced by it in his thinking about American Independence. Perhaps also an Americanized spelling of German Köter. This family is also spread to the other countries for several reasons: the conquest of the British in other continents such as Asia, and another family moving overseas, especially America where so many this family living in that country. ==History== The name was brought into England in the wake of the Norman Conquest.

Those of them who acquired lands in England were called by their manors, while others took the name of the offices they held or the military titles given to them, and sometimes, a younger son of a Norman landowner, on receiving a grant of land in his new home dropped his paternal name and adopted that of his newly acquired property. Early records of the name mention William le Catur who was documented in the year 1193 in the County of Essex and Bernard le Acatour was documented in the year 1300 in County Somerset.

He was a noted contributor to the early development of Bengali detective fiction with his 'Jayanta-Manik' and adventurist 'Bimal-Kumar' stories, dealing with the exploits of Jayanta, his assistant Manik, and police inspector Sunderbabu. Roy also the translated the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám into Bengali. Roy's 'Ajab Deshe Amala' is a well- known translation of Alice in Wonderland. ==Early life== Son of Radhikaprasad Roy, Hemendrakumar Roy was born in Kolkata in 1888, in an affluent Vaidya (Baidya) family originally hailing from Pathuriaghata. Roy inherited a part of his artistic talent from his father who was a more than competent player of the esraj (a string instrument) and regularly gave performance at the famed Star Theatre in North Kolkata. His first published work was a short-story Amar Kahini that appeared in the magazine Basudha in 1903. In 1916, he joined the circle of writers that published in the Bharati journal edited by Sourindramohan Mukherjee and Manilal Ganguly. He also composed a number of horror stories for children. ==Creative years== In 1925, Hemendrakumar Ray became the editor of Nachghar. Apart from this magazine, he helped edit other literary magazines including Rongmoshal. During the next few decades, Hemendrakumar Ray wrote over 80 books for children. He was monumental in contributing a body of detective, horror, and science-fiction work that would form a substantial portion of the early literature for children in Bengali. In 1930, he wrote his first detective story which was published in Mouchak. He is best remembered as the creator of Bimal-Kumar, the adventurer duo and Jayanta- Manik the detective duo. It was Bimal-Kumar's adventure story Jokher Dhan, for which he is famous in Bengali literature for children. He was a staunch believer in supernaturals (according to Khagendranath Mitra in his Introduction to Hemendra Kumar Roy Rachanabali, Volume 1) and he used the supernatural element in several of his adventure and mystery stories. One of the recurring characters in his stories and novels featuring Jayanta-Manik was Inspector Sunderbabu, a chubby and somewhat-cowardly police officer with an insatiable appetite who was also a good friend to the detectives. In Ratrir Jatri, Roy introduced a new detective character named, Hemanta Choudhury and his friend-associate Robin. Apart from literary productions for children, Roy also wrote numerous essays, short stories, and novels for adults. He adapted some foreign author's stories in Bengali.He was also a painter and the choreographer for Shishirkumar Bhaduri's Seeta. He also wrote a volume of lyrics Jaubaner Gaan (that is, 'The Song of Youth'). Several of these lyrics were put to music and sung by Bengali legends like Sachin Dev Burman, Kanai Dey, and Manna Dey. Kazi Nazrul Islam composed music for the lyrics of Hemendra Kumar.One of his short stories, Sindur Chupri, was translated into German and was included in a collection of short stories. He created a comic series titled Tara Teen Bondhu, which consists of seven short stories such as 'Kukur Kahini', 'Nakuler Daon Mara', 'Maharaja Chor Churamoni Bahadur', 'Kamon Kore Totlami Sare', 'Kartik Pujor Bhoot', 'Der Dozon Jahagi', and 'Madhureno Somapoyet'. The three main character of this series - Atal, Patol and Nakul - won huge popularity among the children and youngsters. One of his stories, 'Dersho Khokar Kando' (that is, 'The Deeds of 150 Boys') was made into a film, while several of his works, namely Abar Jokher Dhon and Ratrir Jatri, have been adapted for television. His story Nishithini Bibhisikha was adapted for Bengali movie named Jighansha(1951). The superhit Hindi film Bees Saal Baad was based on the story of Nishithini Bibhisikha. In 1939 a movie named Jakher Dhan based on Hemendrakumar's novel in the same name was made by director Haricharan Bhanja. This film starred Chhaya Devi, Ahindra Choudhury, Jahar Ganguly. This was one of the most popular thriller of Bengali literature. A television serial in the same name was also telecast. over the story in the 1990s. Another Bengali movie in the named Jawker Dhan was released in August, 2017 directed by Sayantan Ghoshal. Pinaki Roy, who has offered post-colonial interpretations of Bengali detective fiction, gives primacy to Roy more as a writer of sleuth narratives than of children's literature. Pinaki Roy credits the litterateur for initiating a trend which would ultimately bring Bengali detective-story-writing from its colonial phase to its anti-imperialistic one: \\"Jayanta, the detective-cum-scientist, is probably one of the earlier fictional Indian sleuths who use their Indian sensibilities to capture Indian criminals operating in what could be identified as an 'indigenous' atmosphere. That Roy would adapt Bram Stoker's Dracula into Bishalgarer Dushshashan, Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles into Nishachari Bibhishika and Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers into Haradhaner Deep attest to his conscious following of Western sleuth writings in order to make something Indian - and therefore post-colonial - out of them\\". ==Select bibliography== *Bhorer Purabi *Beno Jal *Malachandan *Meghdooter Mortye Agomon *Moynamotir Mayakanan *Nil Sayorer Ochinpure *Amabashyar Raat *Andhakarer Bandhu *Jader Dekhechi *Ekhon Jaader Dekhchi *Jokher Dhan *Abar Jokher Dhan *Bangla Rongaloy o Shishirkumar *Omar Khayyam-er Rubaiyat *Jayanter Kirti *Padmarag Buddha *Sonar Anarash *Manush Pishach *Sab Charitra Kalpanik Nai *Hemendra Kumar Roy Rachanabali, Vol 1-27 == In Popular Culture == * Jakher Dhan (1939) * Jawker Dhan (2017) * Sagardwipey Jawker Dhan (2019) ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali detective fiction writers Category:Translators of Omar Khayyám Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:Indian children's writers Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:Novelists from West Bengal ","title":"Hemendra Kumar Roy"},{"id":"7794745","text":"Victoria \\"Vicky\\" Jane Longley (born 26 October 1988 in Bromley, London) is an English actress and singer.

They differ from the main trunkline highway system in that they are not meant to be major through routes, but lightly traveled local access, and are to meet minimum standards for natural features. Rustic roads have lower speed limits than those on other highway systems. Each route is marked by brown and yellow signs, with the route number on a small placard below the sign. The letter \\"R\\" prefix is followed by the number designation. Wisconsin is the only state to have a system of rustic roads. Wisconsin has a separate system of scenic byways following the development of a national system in the 1990s. ==System description== The Rustic Road concept was conceived in 1973. The Wisconsin State Legislature established the program to help preserve lightly traveled scenic rural roads. There are a few requirements that a road must have in order to be designated as a rustic road, such as having outstanding natural features or areas that set the road apart from other roads, be a lightly traveled road, not be scheduled for a major improvement which would change its rustic characteristics, and preferably be at least with a loop, completed closure, or connection to a major highway at both ends of the route. The maximum speed limit established by law is , but can be set lower by a local government if desired. Rustic roads may be dirt, gravel, or paved. They can be one- or two-way and can have accommodations for bicycles and hiking adjacent to or incorporated into the road or surrounding area. The designation process is initiated by application for designation by a local government. File:Rusticroad51.jpgR51, Pierce County File:RusticRoadR26FallSceneryWisconsin.jpgR26 in autumn File:Rustic Road Number 1.jpgThe first Rustic Road, #1 north of Medford, was dedicated in 1975. ==History== The effort to identify rustic roads began in order to help local government and citizens preserve Wisconsin's scenic routes. The Rustic Roads system was established by the 1973 Wisconsin State Legislature. The law created the Wisconsin Rustic Roads Board. The first road was designated in 1975 in Taylor County in the Town of Rib Lake. The application requires the reasons why a road should be designated, photographs, and a resolution of support from the local government. A 10-member volunteer board develops the rules and standards for the roads, and enacts the final approval for each designation. Before approving, two members of the board separately drive and personally assess the proposed route. As of 2014, the system has 115 Rustic Roads for a total length of in 59 of the state's 72 counties.

The fortifications consist of a ditch with unusually smooth walls and a bank in the inner side of ditch. The height difference between the bottom of the ditch and the upper rim of the bank on the inner side can reach . Works have been performed in laterite, a typical African soil consisting of clay and iron oxides. The ditch forms an uneven ring around the area of the ancient Ijebu Kingdom, an area approximately wide in north–south, with the walls flanked by trees and other vegetation, turning the ditch into a green tunnel. ==Myths== Legends of the contemporary Ijebu clan link the Eredo to a fabled wealthy and childless widow named Bilikisu Sungbo. According to them, the monument was built as her personal memorial. In addition to this, her grave is believed to be located in Oke-Eiri, a town in a Muslim area just north of the Eredo. Pilgrims of Christian, Muslim and traditional African religions annually trek to this holy site in tribute to her. Some have connected Bilikisu Sungbo with the legend of the Queen of Sheba, a figure who is mentioned in both the Bible and Quran. In the Hebrew Bible, she is described as having sent a caravan of gold, ivory and other goods from her kingdom to Solomon. In the Quran she is an Ethiopian sun- worshipper involved in the incense trade who converts to Islam; commentators added that her name was \\"Bilqis\\". After excavations in 1999 the archaeologist Patrick Darling was quoted as saying, \\"I don't want to overplay the Sheba theory, but it cannot be discounted ... The local people believe it and that's what is important ... The most cogent argument against it at the moment is the dating.\\" ==History== Multidisciplinary technologist Ade Olufeko inside Sungbo's Eredo in 2017The archaeology of Sungbo's Eredo points to the presence of a large polity in the area before the opening of the Trans-Atlantic trade.Lasisi and Aremu 2016, Olanrewaju B. Lasisi, David A. Aremu, New lights on the archaeology of Sungbo’s eredo, south-western Nigeria  Dig It 3: 54-63, April 2016 https://www.academia.edu/25255530/New_Lights_on_the_Archaeology_of_Sungbo_Eredo_South- Western_Nigeria The Eredo served a defensive purpose when it was built in 800–1000 AD, a period of political confrontation and consolidation in the southern Nigerian rainforest. It was likely to have been inspired by the same process that led to the construction of similar walls and ditches throughout western Nigeria, including earthworks around Ifẹ̀, Ilesa, and the Benin Iya, a series of connected but separate earthworks in the neighboring Edo-speaking region. It is believed that the Eredo was a means of unifying an area of diverse communities into a single kingdom. It seems that the builders of these fortifications deliberately tried to reach groundwater or clay to create a swampy bottom for the ditch. If this could be achieved in shallow depth, builders stopped, even if only at the depth of 1 meter. In some places small, conical idol statues had been placed on the bottom of the ditch. ===Modern times=== The impressive size and complex construction of the Eredo drew worldwide media attention in September 1999 when Dr Patrick Darling, a British archaeologist then with Bournemouth University, surveyed the site and began publicizing his bid to preserve the Eredo and bring the site some prominence. Previously, the Eredo had been little-known outside of the small community of residents and specialists in Yoruba history. Forty years passed between Professor Peter Lloyd's publication of his analysis of the site and that of Darling, but it still served to necessitate a complete rethinking of West Africa's past. In 2017, technologist Olufeko led a freelance team inside the rampart bringing the location and its narrative back into social dialogue. ==See also== *Walls of Benin *Olumo Rock *Lekki Conservation Centre ==References== ==Other sources== * P.C.

He finished his career with a .964 fielding percentage. Seybold then played and coached in several minor league and industrial teams for a few years. In January 1909, he signed a contract to play for the Toledo Mud Hens, but injuries continued to slow Seybold during the 1909 season. From 1910 to 1911, he coached industrial teams in Jeanette. On April 4, 1912, he signed with the Richmond Rebels of the United States Baseball League. His baseball career ended with the demise of the league in June. At the end of July 1919, Babe Ruth equaled Seybold's American League record of 16 home runs in a season; Ruth went on to hit 29 homers in 1919. Seybold was married but had no children. His wife, Wilhelmina \\"Minnie\\" Heitz, died in 1917. In his later years, Seybold was employed as a steward of a social club (Fraternal Order of Eagles) in Jeannette, Pennsylvania. In 1921, Seybold was driving a car when it overturned at a sharp curve on the Lincoln Highway east of Jeanette; he was killed instantly. He left an estate valued at $20,000.

He continued this course at Würzburg, where he also studied the natural sciences and medicine until 1796. After a year at Vienna he settled in 1797 as a practising physician at Mainz, where he also gave medical lectures. In 1801 the Elector of Mainz, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal, summoned him to Aschaffenburg as court physician. In 1803 Windischmann became professor of philosophy and history at the institute for philosophy and theology at Aschaffenburg, and in 1818 was appointed professor of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bonn. He took an active part against the ideas of George Hermes in the University of Bonn, and when the investigation of Hermesianism began at Rome he was one of the German scholars directed to draw up opinions. The first part of his report was sent to Rome in June, 1834, the second part in March, 1835; the Hermesians consequently attributed to Windischmann a large share in the condemnation of their views. In his earlier years Windischmann's philosophy, as shown in his work Ideen zur Physik (I, Würzburg and Bamberg, 1805), was a pantheistic mysticism under the influence of Schelling's philosophy of nature. He believed, however, that he could unite it with Christianity. But gradually he worked his way into a Christian philosophy. In his chief work, Die Philosophie im Fortgang der Weltgeschichte (Philosophy in the progress of World History), he planned to present the history of philosophy in connection with a positive Christian philosophy of history which was influenced by Hegel. But the work was not finished; its four volumes (Bonn, 1827–1834) only dealt with China and Japan. His son was the orientalist Friedrich Heinrich Hugo Windischmann. ==Other writings== *Untersuchungen über Astrologie, Alchimie und Magic (Frankfurt, 1813) *Ueber Etwas, das der Heilkunft Noth thut (Leipzig, 1824), in which he opposed what he saw as the materialistic tendency in medical science, and sought to combine the science with Christian philosophy; *Das Gericht des Herrn uber Europa (Frankfurt, 1814) *Ueber den Begriff der christl.

Introduced in 1964, it was Learjet's first model and created a new market for fast and efficient small business aircraft. Production ended in 1966 after 101 aircraft had been delivered. ==Development== Recognizing the potential of the Swiss-designed single-engine ground-attack FFA P-16 fighter jet, William (Bill) Powell Lear, Sr. established Swiss American Aviation Corporation (SAAC) to produce a two- engined passenger version: the SAAC-23 Execujet. The company moved to Wichita, Kansas and was renamed Lear Jet Corporation. Production began on the first Model 23 Lear Jet on February 7, 1962. The first flight took place on 7 October 1963 with test pilots Hank Beaird and Bob Hagen. On 4 June 1964, the prototype crashed soon after takeoff, when the pilot inadvertently deployed the wing spoilers while demonstrating an engine failure on takeoff. Eventually determined to be pilot error, this mishap did not deter the Federal Aviation Agency (later the Federal Aviation Administration) from awarding the Lear Jet 23 its type certificate on 31 July 1964. On October 13, 1964, the first production aircraft was delivered. Production ended in 1966 after one hundred and one aircraft had been delivered. In 1998, thirty nine Model 23s were estimated to remain in use. Twenty seven are known to have been lost or damaged beyond repair through accidents, the most recent being in 2008.Aviation Safety Network: Learjet 23 ===Noise compliance=== In 2013, the FAA modified the FAR Part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not Stage 3 noise compliant beyond December 31, 2015, with the Lear Jet 23 listed in the Federal Register 78 FR 39576. This meant that any Lear Jet 23's without modified Stage 3 noise-compliant engines - or an approved hushkit - were no longer permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after that date. The ruling noted that appropriate hushkits were not currently available for the Lear Jet 23. ==Aircraft on display== NASA Learjet 23 chase aircraft * N802L – Model 23 on static display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. * N505PF – Model 23 on static display at the Kansas Aviation Museum in Wichita, Kansas. * N20EP – on display outside White Industries, Bates City, Missouri. * N23BY – Model 23 on display at the Arkansas Air & Military Museum in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Additional charter members included Mae Chenoweth, Grace Hudson, and Adah H. Appell. The Articles of Incorporation were signed by the charter members on December 8, 1909 and filed in the office of the Secretary of State of Ohio. The charter was granted on December 13, 1909. In 1923, this date was established as \\"Founders Day\\" since not all collegiate institutions at which chapters were installed had opened for the fall semester by September 6. Originally called \\"Delta Omicron Sorority,\\" the organization changed its name to \\"Delta Omicron Fraternity\\" in 1947 since \\"fraternity\\" was the preferred name in Panhellenic circles. The fraternity has collegiate chapters established throughout the United States. Several chapters were established abroad, but are currently inactive. Delta Omicron is the only organization of its kind, since it was founded by students for students and is also the only professional music fraternity founded by underclassmen. Originally an all- female organization, Delta Omicron first initiated men in 1979 after changing the bylaws to admit men in 1977. ==Delta Omicron Foundation, Inc.== The Delta Omicron Foundation, Inc. was founded on June 17, 1958. and is chartered in Ohio as a nonprofit organization. The Foundation was granted tax-exempt status on March 27, 1964. The Foundation administers the philanthropies of Delta Omicron as a separate corporation. It supports and promotes music and musicians through educational grants and scholarships for music study, the commission of composers, awards for musical accomplishments, subsidies for publications and programs promoting music, and national and international music endeavors. It also supplements Delta Omicron's endowment fund, which was established in 1927. ==Chapter and membership information== Membership is determined on the basis of talent, scholarship, and character and is open to collegiate music students enrolled in schools where Delta Omicron chapters are located, to music faculty members in those schools, and to professional musicians. Over 28,000 members have been initiated.NMC Newsletter Fall 2009 The first honorary memberships were offered to women musicians of \\"national reputation\\" in 1916. Collegiate chapters are chartered in accredited institutions of higher learning and derive their names from the Greek alphabet in the regular sequence according to the date of installation. A member affiliated with a collegiate chapter (either undergraduate or graduate) must be a music major, music minor, or the equivalent of a music minor (as determined by individual chapters). Alumni chapters derive their names by using the name of the nearest collegiate chapter prefixed by the letter Zeta. Alumni chapters adopted Greek letter names beginning in 1944. Delta Omicron was the first music fraternity to establish chapters abroad. International chapters of Delta Omicron are those that are established outside of the boundaries of the United States, the first of which was established in South KoreaAlpha Gamma, \\"History\\" on June 7, 1958. Members of an international chapter may be made up of collegiate or alumni members. International collegiate chapters derive their names from the Greek alphabet, prefixed by the letter Kappa. ==Chapters== Delta Omicron has a total of 183 chapters and clubs. Of the 129 collegiate chapters that have been established in the United States, 37 are active. Of the 46 alumni chapters and clubs that have been established in the United States, 15 are active. Eight chapters - seven collegiate and one alumni - were established in South Korea, due largely to the work of Lenore Harpster Lutz, who traveled to the country with her husband, a missionary. All are currently inactive. In 2017, the Delta Tau chapter at William & Mary disaffiliated with the national organization and formed the fraternity Delta Tau Omicron. ==Publications== The Wheel: Educational Journal of Delta Omicron is the official publication of the fraternity. The journal began publication with volume 1 in June 1915. The Wheel was published annually from 1915 to 1923, semiannually 1924 to 1925, triennially 1926 to 1929, and quarterly since 1930. The editor seeks articles on information related to the fraternity, its members and patrons, collegiate and alumni chapters, special events, awards, and music-related articles of interests to musicians. It is distributed to all current members of the fraternity. The Whistle of Delta Omicron International Music Fraternity—Alumni Newsletter is the official publication of the fraternity for alumni-at-large. The international newsletter began publication with volume 1 in 1952 and is geared to the interests of alumni-at-large members. It was originally distributed to all alumni members of the fraternity annually via mail, however, since January 2004, it has been published online on the Delta Omicron website. ==National Honorary Members, National Patrons, and Citations== A National Honorary Member, recognized as such by the National Board of Directors, is a musician who has attained outstanding recognition in the field. The title of \\"Patron\\" or \\"Patroness\\" may be conferred upon a musician who has attained a national reputation in his or her field. The title may also be conferred upon a nationally recognized patron of music. Citations are presented by the National Board of Directors to individuals or corporations whose support of music or the arts is deemed worthy of recognition. ==National affiliations== Delta Omicron is affiliated with the following organizations: American Classical Music Hall of Fame, American String Teachers Association, College Fraternity Editors Association (CFEA), Music Educators National Conference (MENC), Music Teachers National Association, National American Inter-fraternal Foundation (NIF), National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), National Federation of Music Clubs (NFMC), National Interfraternity Music Council, National Music Council, Professional Fraternity Association (of which it was a charter member), and the Support Music, Music Education Coalition.

She is attached to Birmingham University Royal Naval Unit (URNU), which exists to provide training to undergraduate students in a wide range of naval skills and to provide opportunities for personal development. The ship's company consists of a permanent staff of the commanding officer, two senior rates and two junior rates, but can take up to twelve students with training officers usually embarked when conducting navigational training. Whilst at sea, students are able to put into practice navigation and seamanship skills they have learnt in the classroom during weekly training nights. These include chart planning, acting as Officer of the Watch, using the ship's radar and carrying out seamanship evolutions from anchoring to securing alongside. Instruction is given in engineering, firefighting, damage control and ship handling. 'Sea weekend' training is usually limited to visiting UK coastal ports but recent Easter and summer deployments have included visits to France, Holland, Belgium, and the Channel Islands. The ship is based in HMNB Portsmouth. ==Operational history== ===Royal Naval Auxiliary Service=== XSV Exploit was originally ordered for the now defunct Royal Naval Auxiliary Service (RNXS) and had a distinctive black hull like other RNXS vessels. On 19 March 1994, a serious machinery space fire occurred on Exploit approximately 30 miles of Lundy island as she was being transferred to Portsmouth from Greenock as part of the managed run down of the service by RNXS crew. The Padstow lifeboat and the RAF SAR Helicopter from Chivenor, were scrambled, and a tanker on route to Milford Haven was diverted to help, but were not needed. The fire was later attributed to a major mechanical failure of the starboard main engine, resulting in a large hole in the sump casing. The fire spread quickly to the air ducts, igniting various rubber coolant pipes causing thick acrid smoke. ===Royal Navy=== In June 2017, Exploit, in company with HM Ships , and , deployed to the Baltic to take part in the NATO BALTOPS exercise, the first time that Royal Navy P2000s have been involved in such an exercise. ==Affiliations== * * * TS Blackcap - Birkenhead Sea Cadets * TS Minerva - Rhondda Sea Cadets * TS Sutton Coldfield - Sutton Coldfield Sea Cadets * Hereford Cathedral School CCF * The University of Birmingham * 845 Naval Air Squadron * The town of Berkeley * Brownhills Girl Guides, Walsall ==Notes== ==ReferencesCategory:Archer-class patrol vessels ","title":"HMS Exploit (P167)"},{"id":"7794971","text":"Second warrant officer (2WO) is a warrant officer rank in the Singapore Armed Forces.http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/ranks/warrantofficers.html It was the most junior of the warrant officers until the rank of third warrant officer (3WO) was brought into effect on 1 April 2010.http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/publications/cyberpioneer/news/2010/april/02apr10_news.html Third warrant officers are promoted to second warrant officers after graduation from the Joint Warrant Officer Course (JWOC) at SAF Warrant Officer School at Pasir Laba Camp.

It was the first Incubus song to receive a considerable amount of radio airplay, reaching number three on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and number seven on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 2 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. ==Structure and style== The song describes a state of confusion, with allusions to spontaneous combustion. Lead singer Brandon Boyd says he was inspired to write the song after making a connection between images of spontaneous combustion in a magazine and \\"some turmoil in [his] life, both good and bad\\", namely coming back from a tour to find out that his girlfriend of 7 years had been cheating on him, and that both his grandmother and a close friend of his had died. After seeing a picture in a magazine of a man who had spontaneously combusted, he related the man's problems to his own and was inspired to write the lyric \\"Pardon me while I burst into flames\\" on his hand at that spot. Musically, the song combines fast-paced, ambient verses with prominent turntable scratching, in place of a guitar solo, by DJ Kilmore and a hard-rocking mid-tempo chorus. However, the acoustic version of the song is also well regarded by fans, and helped the song become a radio hit. Initial radio reception was lukewarm, so Boyd and guitarist Mike Einziger decided to perform the song acoustically at several radio stations that had been playing the song, including KROQ-FM, and this acoustic version grabbed the attention of radio programmers and listeners. An acoustic version of the song was released on the When Incubus Attacks Volume 1 EP. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Pardon Me\\" was directed by Steven Murashige and also gained considerable airplay. The video begins with Brandon Boyd and his father, at opposite ends of a hallway. As the two approach each other, Boyd's father begins to regress in age and appearance, while the younger clone begins to grow more elderly, becoming more and more alike as they advance toward each other. When they meet, they pass through each other and continue on in opposite directions. Footage of the band members in white outfits (except for Boyd, who is shirtless) in a red-colored box are also shown, as is footage of the band members in red outfits being surrounded by businessmen and businesswomen. ==Track listing== ;US single # \\"Pardon Me\\" (Album Version) # \\"Crowded Elevator\\" # \\"Pardon Me\\" (Acoustic) # \\"Drive\\" (Acoustic) ;US promotional single # \\"Pardon Me\\" (Acoustic) ;UK single # \\"Pardon Me\\" (Album Version) # \\"I Miss You\\" (Acoustic) # \\"Crowded Elevator\\" ==In popular culture== \\"Pardon Me\\" were released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3.

It is based on the old black-powder .500/450 Magnum Black Powder Express. It fires a projectile at over . ==History== In response to initial case extraction problems with John Rigby & Company's revolutionary .450 Nitro Express, both Eley Brothers and Holland & Holland looked to develop alternatives that would match that excellent cartridge in performance.Hailey. Whilst Eley developed the completely new, mammoth .450 No 2 Nitro Express, Holland & Holland followed Rigby's example and loaded the old black powder .500/450 Magnum Black Powder Express with cordite, creating the .500/450 Nitro Express. The larger case capacity allowed the same ballistics at reduced chamber pressures to the .450 Nitro Express. By the time the .500/450 Nitro Express appeared, the early issues with the .450 Nitro Express had been resolved, and it quickly became the most popular and widely used Elephant hunting round, leaving the .500/450 Nitro Express behind in popularity. In 1907, the .500/450 Nitro Express's fortunes were further eroded by the British Army's ban of .450 caliber ammunition into India and the Sudan. In response to this ban, Holland & Holland developed their .500/465 Nitro Express. By the time the ban was lifted, Mauser's Gewehr 98 bolt actioned rifles offered cheaper alternatives to the expensive double rifles required by the Nitro Express cartridges. ==Use== Balistically the .500/450 Nitro Express is almost identical to the .450 Nitro Express and is considered a good large-bore round, suitable for all dangerous game. One prominent user of the .500/450 Nitro Express was Theodore Roosevelt who carried a Holland & Holland double rifle in this calibre, along with a .405 Winchester and a .30-03 during the 1909-1910 Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition.theodoreroosevelt.com. ==See also== * Nitro Express * 11 mm caliber * List of rifle cartridges ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== * Barnes, Frank C, Cartridges of the World, ed 13, Gun Digest Books, Iola, 2012, . * Haley, Charlie, The .450 Nitro Express, retrieved 29 Nov 16. * Kynoch Ammunition, Big Game Cartridges, kynochammunition.co.uk, retrieved 29 Nov 16. * theodoreroosevelt.com, African Safari Hunter, retrieved 29 Nov 16.

[1963], Earth-to-moon trajectories in the restricted three-body problem, Journal de mecanique, p. 189-218. is a method to simplify trajectory calculations for spacecraft in a multiple-body environment. ==Method== The simplification is achieved by dividing space into various parts by assigning each of the n bodies (e.g. the Sun, planets, moons) its own sphere of influence. When the spacecraft is within the sphere of influence of a smaller body, only the gravitational force between the spacecraft and that smaller body is considered, otherwise the gravitational force between the spacecraft and the larger body is used. This reduces a complicated n-body problem to multiple two-body problems, for which the solutions are the well-known conic sections of the Kepler orbits. Although this method gives a good approximation of trajectories for interplanetary spacecraft missions, there are missions for which this approximation does not provide sufficiently accurate results.Koon, W.S., Lo, M.W., Marsden, J.E., Ross, S.D. (2008) Dynamical Systems, the Three- Body Problem and Space Mission Design. Marsden Books. pp 5. . Notably, it does not model Lagrangian points. ==Example== On an Earth-to-Mars transfer, a hyperbolic trajectory is required to escape from Earth's gravity well, then an elliptic or hyperbolic trajectory in the Sun's sphere of influence is required to transfer from Earth's sphere of influence to that of Mars, etc. By patching these conic sections together—matching the position and velocity vectors between segments—the appropriate mission trajectory can be found. ==See also== * Two-body problem * N-body problem * Sphere of influence * Kerbal Space Program, a popular simulator based on the patched conic approximation ==References== ==Bibliography== * Carlson, K.

After less than three months, Roth was released and he signed with the Red Wing Manufacturers of the Class-D Minnesota–Wisconsin League. In 1912, he played for the St. Joseph Drummers of the Western League. He played for the Kansas City Blues of the American Association in 1913 and 1914. Roth played third base for the first four years of his career, but was converted into an outfielder in 1914. He also earned the nickname \\"Braggo\\" during the 1914 season due to his boastful attitude about hitting. Roth made his MLB debut with the Chicago White Sox of the American League, when they purchased him from the Blues in August 1914. He was switched back to third base, but his playing time decreased in 1915 due to his poor defensive play and the acquisition of Eddie Murphy, resulting in the White Sox trading Roth with a player to be named later (later decided to be Larry Chappell), Ed Klepfer and $31,500 to the Cleveland Indians for Shoeless Joe Jackson in August 1915. Roth hit three home runs in the final week of the 1915 season to increase his season total to seven, one more than Rube Oldring. Braggo struck out often, leading the American League in strikeouts in 1917, and finishing among the leaders four other times. However, he also drew decent numbers of walks for the times, with a lifetime .367 on-base percentage. He was several times among the stolen base leaders, finishing as high as second in the league in 1918. He led the league in hit-by-pitch in 1918 and was two other times among the leaders. With the Indians seeking pitching, they traded Roth to the Philadelphia Athletics for Larry Gardner, Charlie Jamieson and Elmer Myers before the 1919 season. However, Roth's loud personality clashed with the reserved Connie Mack, so Mack traded Roth with Red Shannon to the Boston Red Sox for Jack Barry and Amos Strunk in June 1919. Before the 1920 season, the Boston Red Sox traded Roth and Shannon to the Washington Senators for Eddie Foster, Harry Harper and Mike Menosky. Roth slumped with the Red Sox, and after the season, he was traded by the Senators to the New York Yankees for Duffy Lewis and George Mogridge. Roth missed a substantial portion of the 1921 season with a knee injury. Before the 1922 season, Roth declared his knee fit for play, but the Yankees released him due to his knee injury, which did not respond to treatment. Roth played for the Blues and St. Paul Saints, also of the American Association, in 1923. He surfaced again with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League in 1928. In 811 games over 8 seasons in the major leagues, Roth posted a .284 batting average (804-for-2831) with 427 runs, 30 home runs, 422 RBI and 190 stolen bases. ==Death== Roth died in an automobile accident with a newspaper truck at the age of 44 in Chicago. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders ==References== ==External links== Category:1892 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Philadelphia Athletics players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Washington Senators (1901–1960) players Category:New York Yankees players Category:American League home run champions Category:St. Joseph Drummers players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:St. Paul Saints (AA) players Category:Hollywood Stars players Category:Baseball players from Wisconsin Category:People from Burlington, Wisconsin Category:Road incident deaths in Illinois ","title":"Braggo Roth"},{"id":"7795109","text":"Mississippi's 4th congressional district covers the southeastern region of the state. It includes all of Mississippi's Gulf Coast, stretching ninety miles between the Alabama border to the east and the Louisiana border to the west, and extends north into the Pine Belt region. It includes three of Mississippi's four most heavily populated cities: Gulfport, Biloxi, and Hattiesburg. Other major cities within the district include Bay St. Louis, Laurel, and Pascagoula. The people of the Mississippi's 4th are currently represented by Republican Steven Palazzo. During the 111th Congress, MS-4, along with Texas's 17th congressional district, was the most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat, with a Cook PVI of R+20. However, on November 2, 2010, the Democratic incumbents of both districts were defeated by their respective Republican challengers. State Representative Steven Palazzo defeated Rep. Gene Taylor by a 5% vote differential.2010 Mississippi Election Results New York Times. November 12, 2010. From statehood to the election of 1846, Mississippi elected representatives at-large statewide on a general ticket. ==Cities== Three of Mississippi's four most heavily populated cities, Gulfport, Biloxi, Hattiesburg are in the Fourth District. Other major cities within the district include Bay St. Louis, Laurel, and Pascagoula. ==Counties== Since 2013 the entire counties of Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Pearl River, Stone, George, Marion, Lamar, Forrest, Perry, Greene, Jones, and Wayne, along with the southeastern part of Clarke are counted in this district. ==Federal highways== Interstate 59 is an important north-south route that traverses the district, while coastal Interstate 10 serves as the major east-west route from New Orleans to Mobile. US Highway 49 is a vital hurricane evacuation route and is four-laned from Gulfport to Jackson. US Highway 84 enters the state near Waynesboro and is four-laned statewide, passing through Laurel, Brookhaven and Natchez. ==Boundaries== Prior to 2003, the district included most of Jackson, all of Natchez and the southwestern part of the state. In 2003, after Mississippi lost a seat in redistricting, the old 4th District was eliminated. Most of Jackson, as well as the bulk of the district's black constituents, were drawn into the 2nd District, while most of Jackson's suburbs were drawn into the 3rd District. As a result, most of the old 5th District was redefined as the new 4th District.Almanac of American Politics, 2002, p. 872 The perimeter of the current Fourth District extends across the ninety-mile coastal southern edge of Mississippi from the Louisiana border to the Alabama border, following the Alabama state line north along the eastern border of the state to a point due east of Quitman in Clarke County where it is bounded by the 3rd District and then moves in an irregular fashion south of Quitman until it reaches the county line with Wayne County, and then follows the northern and western borders to wholly contain Jones, Forrest, Lamar, and Marion counties until it reaches the Louisiana state line, ultimately bounded by the Pearl River winding to its outlet in Lake Borgne. ==History== The district, like most of Mississippi, is built on a strong history of agriculture. == List of members representing the district == { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !

Taylor faced challenger Randall \\"Randy\\" McDonnell, a former IRS agent. McDonnell, the Republican Party nominee, had also unsuccessfully challenged Taylor in both 1998 and 2000. Taylor first was elected in 1989 to Mississippi's 5th congressional district, after having lost to Larkin I. Smith in the 1988 race for that open seat, which had been vacated by Trent Lott when Lott made a successful run for the Senate. Smith died eight months later in a plane crash. Taylor came in first in the special election primary to fill the seat, winning the runoff election two weeks later and taking office on October 18, 1989. In 1990, Taylor won a full term in the 5th District with 81% of the vote, and has been reelected at each election since. His district was renumbered the 4th after the redistricting of 2000, which cost Mississippi a Congressional seat. In 2004, Taylor was reelected to the House with 64% of their vote, choosing him over both Republican nominee Michael Lott and Reform nominee Tracella Hill. ===2008=== ===2010=== ==Historical district boundaries== 2003 - 2013 ==See also== *Mississippi's congressional districts *List of United States congressional districts ==References== * * * Congressional Biographical Directory of the United States 1774–present 04 ","title":"Mississippi's 4th congressional district"},{"id":"7795111","text":"Corrado Maria Daclon Corrado Maria Daclon (born 1963) is an Italian scientist and journalist. == Biography == He was born in Milan.

He was educated at Stowe School, an independent school in Stowe, Buckinghamshire. He undertook National Service in the Royal Artillery from 1955 to 1957. He was commissioned on 24 March 1956 as a second lieutenant. He was transferred to the Regular Army Reserves of Officers on 29 July 1957, thereby ending his active service.

The decision to produce a new hymnbook was taken at the Methodist Conference of 1979, and the new book was authorised for use in all Methodist Churches in the Connexion at the 1982 Conference in Plymouth. The hymns are presented in three sections, covering, respectively, God's Nature, God's World and God's People, followed by a selection of Psalms and canticles. Of the 823 hymns, over 150 were written by Charles Wesley (1707–88), brother of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Isaac Watts also has a significant number of hymns included. The most represented hymnwriter of the 20th century is Fred Pratt Green (1903–2000), who has 27 hymns included. Hymns and Psalms remains an authorised part of the Methodist hymnody and is still in active use within the Methodist Church, although the Methodist Conference Faith and Order Committee has also released a new hymn book, Singing the Faith, which was approved at the 2010 Methodist Conferencehttp://www.methodist.org.uk/conference/conference- reports/2010-reports and published in 2011. ==See also== *List of English- language hymnals by denomination ==References== Category:Methodism in the United Kingdom Category:Protestant hymnals ","title":"Hymns and Psalms"},{"id":"7795242","text":"\\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" is the second track on the posthumous Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk album release by Jeff Buckley.

The holy day celebrates the birth of Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith. The 2020 date is October 19.http://bahaiblog.net/site/bahai-calendar/ Bahá'u'lláh was born on 12 November 1817 in Tehran, Iran, and this holy day was instituted in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws, where Baháʼu'lláh first refers to four great festivals: the Festival of Ridván, the Declaration of the Báb, the birth of the Báb—who is considered to be a Manifestation of God, and who foretold the coming of Baháʼu'lláh—and the birth of Baháʼu'lláh. In questions submitted to Baháʼu'lláh after writing the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Baháʼu'lláh states that the two days commemorating the births of the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh are seen to be one in the \\"sight of God\\" and are referred to as the \\"Twin Birthdays\\". ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of Baháʼu'lláh, stated that during the holy day the community should rejoice together to increase the unity of the community. Baháʼís usually observe the holy day with community gatherings where prayers are shared and the birth of Baháʼu'lláh is celebrated. Baháʼu'lláh stated that in communities where the majority of the population are Shiʻa Muslims, such as Iran, his followers should exercise caution in celebrating the twin birthdays so that they do not upset the majority of the population who are mourning during the Islamic month of Muharram. In the Islamic calendar, which is a lunar calendar, the two holy days fall on consecutive days: the birth of the Báb is on the first day of Muharram in 1235 AH (20 October 1819), and the birth of Baháʼu'lláh is on the second day of Muharram in 1233 AH (12 November 1817). Baháʼu'lláh stated that if the holy days occur during the Baháʼí month of fasting, Baháʼís need not observe the fast those days. Since the Baháʼí calendar is a solar calendar, the decision to celebrate the Twin Holy Birthdays in a solar or lunar basis remains to the Universal House of Justice. Until March 20, 2015, in most of the world, the holy day was celebrated according to the solar year on 12 November, and the birth of the Báb was celebrated on 20 October. Since days in the Baháʼí calendar start at sunset, the holy day started on the evening of 11 November and proceeded until sunset on 12 November. However, in 2014, the Universal House of Justice decided to celebrate the twin holy days on the first and second day following the eighth new moon after Naw-Rúz, starting from March 20, 2015 onwards. Thus from March 20, 2015 onward the day where the Birth of Baháʼu'lláh is celebrated will change from year to year. == References == == Further reading == * Baháʼí World Centre (2017).

He played a prominent role in several military campaigns in West Virginia and Maryland. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Kelley was born in New Hampton, a small village in New Hampshire. At the age of 19, he went to Wheeling, Virginia, a center of the slave trade. He engaged in the merchandise business until 1851, when he became a freight agent for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. ===Civil War=== At outbreak of the Civil War he was living in Philadelphia and working for the B&O; Railroad. He left his position there and moved to Wheeling to take command of the 1st Virginia Infantry, a Federal volunteer three-months regiment, and was appointed as its colonel.Newell, Clayton R., Lee vs. McClellan, The First Campaign, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1996, pg. 77 Warner, p. 260. His first service was at Philippi, where he captured the Confederate camp equipage and was himself badly wounded. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on August 5, 1861, backdated to May, and was victorious at Romney and Blue's Gap (Hanging Rocks Pass). Afterward, Kelley commanded a division of 10,000 men in the Department of Harper's Ferry. In 1862 he served under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, and the following year he was in command of the West Virginia department and pursued General Robert E. Lee during the Retreat from Gettysburg. In 1864, he checked the enemy at Folck's Mill, New Creek, and Moorefield, West Virginia. He was brevetted as a major general of volunteers on August 5, 1864.Eicher, p. 329. Kelley, along with his immediate superior Maj. Gen. George Crook, was captured by a small raiding party of Confederate partisans on February 21, 1865. Kelley was sent to a prison in Richmond, Virginia, but he and Crook were released on March 20 by a special exchange. He resigned from the army on June 1, 1865. ===Postbellum career=== After the war ended, Kelley was appointed an internal revenue collector in 1866. After serving in that role for ten years, he became the head of the Hot Springs, Arkansas, Military Reservation in 1876. In 1883, President Chester A. Arthur appointed him an examiner of pensions. ===Death=== Kelley died in Oakland, Maryland, and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. His grave was created by sculptor W.S. Davis and completed ca. 1861. The gravestone is made of granite (6 x 5 x 3 ft.) with a relief (2 x 2 x 6 ft.) of bronze inset on the front of the stone, just above two inscribed plaques. The relief is a bust of Kelley, who has a full goatee, mustache, and a military uniform. One plaque on the gravestone is inscribed: :BENJAMIN F.

Written by Chris Addison and Carl Cooper, it was based around Chris Addison giving a lecture on the evolution of man from \\"ugly ape\\" into the all time \\"Top Species\\". Addison was supported in this spoof lecture by Professor Austin Herring, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at St Dunstan's College Cambridge, who was played by Geoffrey McGivern. The Professor was frequently ridiculed, and was usually introduced as the author of a particular book. The books were always amusingly titled, and were different in every introduction. Other cast members of the show were Jo Enright and Dan Tetsell who performed sketches to illustrate the lecture. The series was produced by Simon Nicholls. Professor Herring gave the impression of being a prolific author, although his book titles were invariably absurd. In the preamble to each show, Chris Addison would introduce the Professor as, for example: \\"...our resident expert...polymath...and author of many important scholarly works such as 'What are YOU looking at? - a sideways look at the origins of the squint' ...and... 'Here's looking at Euclid - geometry in the films of Humphrey Bogart' , as well as being editor of 'Pop Goes The Weasel - a treasury of vivisection anecdotes' .\\" For each of his contributions within the main show, The Professor himself would also mention an 'appropriate' paper he had written relating to the topic being discussed, also humorously titled. In May 2006 The Ape That Got Lucky was awarded the Gold Sony Award for comedy. All four episodes were then released on a 2-CD set. The April 2006 series Chris Addison's Civilisation is a follow-up to The Ape That Got Lucky; it has the same format and the same cast but the lectures focus on the building and making of a civilization rather than the evolution theme of this series. ==External links== * * Chris Addison's Website Category:2005 radio programme debuts Category:2005 radio programme endings Category:BBC Radio 4 programmes Category:BBC Radio comedy programmes ","title":"The Ape That Got Lucky"},{"id":"7795419","text":"The Eastern Sports Association, often referred to in the business simply as \\"the Maritimes,\\" was a Canadian professional wrestling promotion based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It ran during the spring and summer months from 1969 to 1976. ==History== The ESA, a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (1975–76), was owned by Al Zinck in partnership with Rudy Kay (1969–75) and Bobby Kay (1975-76) and promoted wrestling under the marquee name International Wrestling. In 1977, the ESA dissolved and Bobby Kay formed Trans-Canada Wrestling, and Al Zinck continued to promote International Wrestling under the name 'Maritime International Sports Ltd' with George Cannon and later Don Carson as bookers. At the end of the 1977 season, Al Zinck retired from promoting until 1984, when he reactivated International Wrestling with James J. Dillon as booker. They ran cards seven nights a week across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The nightly cards were almost identical for the week, so they could be promoted by one TV show. The week would start Saturday nights in New Glasgow, with their main stop at the Halifax Forum every Tuesday night, followed by a TV taping on Wednesday morning at the CJCH- TV studios on Robie Street in Halifax. This show would be broadcast across the Maritimes Saturday on the ATV network. Host Clary Fleming would announce the matches, do the play by play and interview the wrestlers. Eight events a week, including the TV show, was a heavy schedule, but it was for only about six months a year (May–October). In the winter months, hockey dominated arena bookings, and poor driving conditions on the roads could keep fans home and make it difficult for the wrestlers to travel from town to town on schedule. The first card of each new wrestling season would feature a Battle Royal. The Cormier brothers (Rudy Kay, Bobby Kay, Leo Burke and The Beast [Ivan]) were the top faces, along with Johnny Weaver (1975) and Tommy Gilbert (1976-77). The top heels were Freddie Sweetan, Mike Dubois, Killer Karl Krupp, Jim Dillon, \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown, Lord Alfred Hayes, The Brute, Bolo & Gito Mongol and The Mercenaries. The Stomper and Eric Pomeroy were heels who turned face. Future stars Rick Martel, Roddy Piper, Tony Atlas, Rocky Johnson and Terry Gordy also paid their dues here. As well, former world champions Pat O'Connor, Harley Race, Dory Funk Jr. and Lou Thesz made appearances.

The novel was also included in Anthony Burgess's 99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939 (1984). ==Early life== Robert Nye was born in London in 1939.\\"Nye, Robert (1939-), in Ray, Mohit K (ed.) (2007) The Atlantic Companion To Literature In English, Atlantic, New Delhi, , p. 402 His father was a civil servant, his mother a farmer's daughter. He attended Southend High School for Boys and had published his first poem, \\"Kingfisher\\", in the London Magazine (September 1955; Volume 2, Number 9) by the age of sixteen. At other times between 1955 and 1961 he worked at a variety of jobs: newspaper reporter, milkman, postman and labourer in a market garden. Nye married his first wife, Judith Pratt, in 1959. In 1961 they moved to a remote cottage in north Wales, where Nye devoted himself full-time to writing. There he developed an interest in Welsh and Celtic legends, reflected later in his fiction for both adults and children. == Writing career == His first book, Juvenilia 1 (1961), was a collection of poems. A second volume, Juvenilia 2 (1963), won the Eric Gregory Award. Both volumes were enthusiastically received and Martin Seymour-Smith described Nye as showing a \\"precocity unique in this century\\". This view was supported by G. S. Fraser, who in an article in The Times Literary Supplement convincingly established an affinity between Nye's early poetry and that of Robert Graves. To support his continuance as a poet, Nye began to contribute reviews to British literary journals and newspapers. He became the poetry editor for The Scotsman in 1967, and served as poetry critic of The Times from 1971 to 1996, while also contributing regular reviews of new fiction to The Guardian. Nye started writing stories for children to entertain his three young sons. His children's novel Taliesin and a collection of stories called March Has Horse's Ears were published by Faber and Faber in 1966. When Nye published his first adult novel, Doubtfire (1967), it was described by P. J. Kavanagh as \\"breathless\\" and \\"brilliant\\"; Kavanagh also referred to the author's \\"love affair with rhythms and language\\". That same year Nye divorced his first wife. A year later he married Aileen Campbell, Nye's next publication after Doubtfire was a return to children's literature, a freewheeling version of Beowulf that has remained in print in many editions since 1968. In 1970, Nye published another children's book, Wishing Gold, and received the James Kennaway Memorial Award for his collection of short stories, Tales I Told My Mother (1969). During the early 1970s Nye wrote several plays for BBC radio, including A Bloody Stupid Hole (1970), Reynolds, Reynolds (1971), and a version of Penthesilea by Heinrich von Kleist (1971). He was also commissioned by Covent Garden Opera House to write an unpublished libretto for Harrison Birtwistle's opera, Kronia (1970). Nye held the position of writer in residence at the University of Edinburgh, 1976–1977, during which time he received the Guardian Fiction Prize, followed by the 1976 Hawthornden Prize for his novel Falstaff. ==Selected works== === Poetry === * Juvenilia 1 (1961) * Juvenilia 2 (1963) * Darker Ends (1969) * Two Prayers (1973) * Agnus Dei (1973) * Five Dreams (1973) * Divisions on a Ground (1976) * A Collection of Poems 1955 - 1988 (1989) * 14 Poemes (1994) * Henry James and Other Poems (1995) * Collected Poems (1996) * 16 Poems (2005) * The Rain and the Glass: 99 Poems, New and Selected (2005) * An Almost Dancer: Poems 2005-11 (2012) === Novels === * Doubtfire (1967) * Falstaff (1976) * Merlin (UK: Hamish Hamilton, 1978) (US: Putnam, 1979) * Faust (1980) * The Voyage of the Destiny (1982) * The Memoirs of Lord Byron (1989) * The Life and Death of My Lord Gilles de Rais (1990) * Mrs. Shakespeare: The Complete Works (1993) * The Late Mr Shakespeare (1998) === Story collections === * Tales I Told My Mother (1969) * The Facts of Life and Other Fictions (1983) === Stories for children === * March Has Horse's Ears (1966) * Taliesin (1966) * Beowulf: A New Telling (original UK title Bee Hunter: Adventures of Beowulf ) (1968) * Wishing Gold (1970) * Poor Pumpkin (1971) - Illustrated by Derek Collard * Once Upon Three Times (1978) * The Bird of the Golden Land (1980) * Harry Pay the Pirate (1981) * Lord Fox and Other Spine-Chilling Tales (1997) === Plays === * Sawney Bean[with Bill Watson] (1970) * The Seven Deadly Sins, A Mask (1974) * Penthesilea, Fugue, and Sisters (1976) === Editions === * A Choice of Sir Walter Ralegh's Verse (1972) * William Barnes, Selected Poems (1973) * A Choice of Swinburne's Verse (1973) * The Faber Book of Sonnets (1976) * The English Sermon 1750-1850 (1976) * PEN New Poetry 1 (1986) * First Awakenings: The Early Poems of Laura Riding (1992) * A Selection of the Poems of Laura Riding (1994) * Some Poems by Ernest Dowson (2006) * Some Poems by Thomas Chatterton (2008) * Some Poems by Clere Parsons (2008) * The Liquid Rhinoceros and Other Uncollected Poems by Martin Seymour-Smith (2009) * Some Poems by James Reeves (2009) ==References== ==External links== * Nye at Fantastic Fiction * Robert Nye: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center * * * Category:1939 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century English novelists Category:English male poets Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:British conscientious objectors Category:People associated with the Friends' Ambulance Unit Category:People educated at Southend High School for Boys Category:Writers of historical fiction set in the Middle Ages Category:British male poets Category:English male novelists Category:20th-century British male writers ","title":"Robert Nye"},{"id":"7795498","text":"Gads Hill Place today Dickens' Dream by Robert William Buss, portraying Dickens at his desk at Gads Hill surrounded by many of his characters H.F. Chorley, Kate Dickens, Mamie Dickens, Charles Dickens, C.A. Collins and Georgina Hogarth Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent, sometimes spelt Gadshill Place and Gad's Hill Place, was the country home of Charles Dickens, the most successful British author of the Victorian era. Today the building is the independent Gad's Hill School. The house was built in 1780 for a former Mayor of Rochester, Thomas Stephens, opposite the present Sir John Falstaff Public House. Gad's Hill is where Falstaff commits the robbery that begins Shakespeare's Henriad trilogy (Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2 and Henry V). ==Dickens== Charles Dickens first saw the mansion when he was 9 years old in 1821, when his father John Dickens told Charles that if he worked hard enough, one day he would own it or just such a house.Forster, John The Life of Charles Dickens Published by Cecil Palmer, London (1872-74) As a boy, Dickens would often walk from Chatham to Gads Hill Place as he wished to see it again and again as an image of his possible future.Ackroyd, Peter Dickens Published by Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd (1990) p. 32. Dickens was later to write, \\" I used to look at it as a wonderful Mansion (which God knows it is not) when I was a very odd little child with the first faint shadows of all my books in my head - I suppose.\\" Thirty-five years later, after Dickens had risen to fame and wealth, he discovered that the house was for sale and bought it for £1790 in March 1856 from fellow writer Eliza Lynn (later known as novelist Mrs. Eliza Lynn Linton). Initially Dickens bought the house as an investment, intending to let it,Ackroyd, p. 749. but changed his mind and used it instead as a country retreat, moving into the house in June 1857. Dickens had bookshelves installed in his study at Gads Hill Place, some of which contained dummy books the titles of which he invented to reflect his own prejudices and opinions, including Hansard's Guide to Refreshing Sleep, History of a Short Chancery Suit in twenty-one volumes, Socrates on Wedlock, King Henry the Eighth's Evidences of Christianity, and the series The Wisdom of Our Ancestors: I Ignorance, II Superstition, III The Block, IV The Stake, V The Rack, VI Dirt, and VII Disease. Alongside these was placed a very narrow dummy volume entitled The Virtues of Our Ancestors.Fido, Martin Charles Dickens Published by Hamlyn Publishing, London (1970) pg 119 Dickens was visited at Gad’s Hill Place in 1857 by Danish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen, who was invited for two weeks but who stayed for five.Ackroyd, pg781 Other guests included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Charles Allston Collins, Wilkie Collins, Marcus Stone, H.F. Chorley, Percy Fitzgerald, John Leech, Alexander William Kinglake, William Powell Frith and Charles Fechter. In 1864 Fechter gave Dickens a prefabricated two-storey Swiss chalet as a Christmas present. Dickens had it assembled on land he owned on the opposite side of the Rochester High Road.Ackroyd, pg 956 Later, he had a brick-lined tunnel dug between the house's front lawn and the chalet. During the spring and summer months, Dickens worked on many of his later works in his study on the top floor of this Swiss chalet, including A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend and the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The chalet has been preserved and was moved to Eastgate House in Rochester High Street, Rochester, as a memorial to the writer. The house remained Dickens's country home until his death in 1870, dying as he did of a stroke on a couch in the dining room there. Much of the contents of the house were auctioned after his death.Ackroyd, pg 1082 ==Later history== Gads Hill Place was bought by Charles Dickens, Jr. after his father's death, but he was forced to give it up in 1879 because of his own ill-health and financial difficulties. The house was bought in 1890 by the Hon. Francis Law Latham, the then Advocate-General of Bombay.'Personal Notes' Otago Witness, Putanga 1921, 11 Hakihea (1890), Page 42 - National Library of New Zealand In 1924 the house became Gad's Hill School, which it remains today.Carlisle, D. J., 'A History of Gad's Hill Place School for Girls from 1924 to 1946', (2010), As of 2013, the school was moving into purpose-built buildings in the grounds of the house, and there was a plan to open the house as a museum. In June 2008 the house was shown in the Channel 4 TV docudrama Dickens' Secret Lover, presented by actor Charles Dance, on Dickens's affair with the actress Ellen Ternan during the last 13 years of his life.

Winner of various hometown beauty contests, she started her acting career after working as make-up artist with small parts on various TV shows including The Jeffersons and Dynasty. After appearing in 1983 film Scarface and guest starring on Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Michaels was cast as Santana Andrade on the NBC daytime soap opera Santa Barbara, replacing Ava Lazar in this role. ===Dallas=== In the late 1980s, Warner Bros. was looking for a Victoria Principal lookalike to step into the role of Pamela Ewing on Dallas (1978 TV series), after Victoria Principal had left the series to pursue other interests. Late in 1988, Michaels appeared briefly in the first episode of the 12th season as Pamela Ewing with her change in appearance being attributed to plastic surgery after her near-fatal car accident. In the penultimate season 13, the producers of the series were looking for a Pam look-alike in order to give Bobby one last fling before his marriage to April Stevens, played by Sheree J. Wilson, and to give Bobby Ewing a chance to sort of say goodbye to his former wife, as he never had the chance when Pamela had left abruptly back in 1987. Michaels was asked to return to the show, this time not as Pamela Ewing, but as a Pam Ewing lookalike named Jeanne O'Brien. After her 4-episode stint on the show, Michaels' character Jeanne was written out. After Dallas, Michaels acted on one independent movie that was never released, and worked on stage. She is single. ==References== ==External links== * Category:American television actresses Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:1949 births ","title":"Margaret Michaels"},{"id":"7795508","text":"Earthbeat is a compilation album of Future Sound of London's early releases, using several aliases.

The park is located in western Arizona about north of Wenden. It is accessed via a paved two-lane road off either U.S. Route 60 to the south or U.S. Route 93 to the east. Owing to its remoteness, the park is often considered one of the \\"best kept secrets\\" of the state park system. Alamo Lake State Park features camping facilities and attracts wildlife enthusiasts, as the park is home to numerous wildlife species including the bald eagle. The park's remoteness and distance from cities also makes it a destination for stargazing. ==Alamo Lake== Alamo Lake itself is formed by the Alamo Dam that is part of the Alamo Lake State Park administered by the Arizona State Parks. The lake impounds runoff from the Bill Williams River, an intermittent tributary of the Colorado River. The dam was constructed in 1968 by the Army Corps of Engineers, primarily for flood control purposes. The dam is an earthfill dam that rises from the streambed. While the Bill Williams River is often dry, heavy seasonal rains maintain the lake's depth. During extreme flood events, the reservoir can fill rapidly; the lake has been recorded to rise in a single night due to extreme flooding. Unusually high flows during the 1970s and 1980s increased the depth and size of the reservoir to unexpected levels, giving birth to recreational and fishing possibilities. Since then, the lake has been stocked with numerous fish species, including largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish, channel catfish, flathead catfish and tilapia. The lake is host to fishing tournaments and has been the location of at least one Arizona state fishing record. The park can be accessed by a paved road from Highway 60 at the Wenden turn-off to the north on Alamo Lake Road. ==References== ==External links== * *Arizonan.com Article *Arizona Boating Locations Facilities Map *Arizona Fishing Locations Map Category:1969 establishments in Arizona Category:Dams completed in 1968 Category:Dams in Arizona Category:Parks in La Paz County, Arizona Category:Protected areas established in 1969 Category:Reservoirs in La Paz County, Arizona Category:Reservoirs in Mohave County, Arizona Category:State parks of Arizona Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Reservoirs in Arizona ","title":"Alamo Lake State Park"},{"id":"7795585","text":"Pehuajó Partido () is a partido in the northeast of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina.

Tibetan mythology refers to the traditional as well as the religious stories that have been passed down by the Tibetan people. Tibetan mythology is comprised mainly of national mythology stemming from the Tibetan culture as well as religious mythology from both Tibetan Buddhism and Bön Religion. These myths are often passed down orally, through rituals or through traditional art like sculptures or cave paintings. They also feature a variety of different creatures ranging from gods to spirits to monsters play a significant role in Tibetan mythology with some of these myths have broken into mainstream Western media, with the most notable one being the Abominable Snowman – the Yeti.Yves Bonnefoy Asian Mythologies - 1993 p. 302 \\"These remarks indicate in barest outline the perspective in which the study of Tibetan mythology is approached here. We will not describe Tibetan religion in its entirety, whether in the Buddhist or the pre-Buddhist periods, but only certain mythological elements that appear in it, which one can assume to be indigenous, that is, not introduced by Buddhism.\\" ==National mythology== National Tibetan mythology stems from the history of the country and is often passed down either through word of mouth or through forms of art like cave paintings. This includes images of sacred mythological creatures like the Five Clawed Great Eagle of the Sky. Cave paintings were also used to record information about how the Tibetan people lived as well as valued their religion as well as gods during the time the cave painting was created. ===Creation myth=== Some of the most known national myths in this include perhaps one of the most well-known myths, the Tibetan creation myth, Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa who was believed to be the monkey ancestor of the Tibetan people. Many versions of this myth are presented however the widely accepted version being that the monkey ancestor, Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa arrived in Tibet when the world was covered in water and eventually had children that were baby monkeys. These children eventually learned how to use tools, harvest crops, and become self-sufficient and created a civilization, the Tibetan people are said to be descendants of this civilization. ===Myths from the Tibetan landscape=== Many traditional Tibetan myths are based on its unique landscape being located atop a plateau and amongst many mountains. Some of these notable myths include ‘Wild Men of the Tibetan Steppes’, which tells the tale of groups of hairy wild men that were said to be living on the peaks of Tibet amongst the snow and mythical white lions. They were said to be hairy naked savages by some, and the Mongolians referred to them as wild men or bamburshe. Others have said that the footprints of these supposed wild men were actually from bears. The immured anchorite is another myth which concerns monks that are confined within a dark, stony walled space only enough fit for one person and would meditate in that small space for the whole of their lives, with a single hole present as to be able to pass food and drink through. These monks take a vow to live their lives in the darkness and these stone walls are not only the place they spend their entire life in but also their tomb. Despite having many national Tibetan myths that are based on the culture and environment in Tibet, there are many myths that share similarities to the mythology from other cultures as Tibet shares borders spanning across different countries. This includes the Epic of King Gesar a ballad follows the story of a brave and fearless lord, Gesar from the mythical kingdom of GLing, and the various heroic deeds he accomplished. Although this is a myth which is a well-known Tibetan myth in the form of an epic poem that is still being sung in the form of a ballad by many throughout Tibet, Mongolia, and much of Central Asia. ==Buddhism== The religious mythology present in Tibetan mythology is mostly from Vajrayana Buddhism and Bön Religion. Although the two are separate religions, they are often blended together within Tibetan mythology. Buddhism originally spread from India to Tibet and many myths have been passed down through the form of artworks involving the Samsara, which is the Buddhist cycle of life and death that is at the bane of Buddhism. Bon religion, on the other hand, is a Tibetan religion that has many shared beliefs with Buddhism and has many myths that originate before Buddhism was introduced into the country. Bon religion primarily involves making peace between the human and celestial realms and is closely linked to Tibetan folklore. Religious concepts such as the Rainbow body level of realization are also present in this category. ===Reincarnation=== Ideas of reincarnation as well as ghosts and spirits also appear often in these myths as the cycle of rebirth is a concept that entails souls as a temporary form, where some souls become ghosts and roam the world if this cycle is disrupted or unable to be completed. For example in Tibet there are a series of popular narratives regarding death and the afterlife in Buddhism, a story known as ‘A ghost in Monk’s Clothes’ is one of these narratives which depicts ghosts as the lingering souls of humans who are unable to move on and that in order to move on, understanding the samsara as well as reflecting on one’s life is required. These two qualities are rooted in Buddhism. Buddhist art is often used to record and display myths and is often art that requires active participation from the viewer in order to create meaning for the piece, this also means that it is not just trying to tell a story but also portray a mentality and way of thinking. This idea in Buddhism has been present in Tibetan mythology for a long time and is often seen in Buddhist sculptures throughout history. Although Bon religion and Buddhism are the main religions where most of the myths stem from, Tibet is located in South-West China and borders Burma, India, Nepal, and Bhutan there are also many myths shared within these cultures religions. For example, from India the Hindu demon Jvarasura the fever deity is also present within Tibetan mythology. ==Deities within Tibetan Mythology== A variety of different deities are present within Tibetan mythology and some of the more well-known deities in Tibetan mythology are either from the national mythology of Tibet or from Buddhism, and so are present and shared amongst many cultures. ===Mountain gods=== Mountain gods are one of the more notable creatures this is as Tibet is located West of the Central China plain and is covered in many mountains it is also home to some of the tallest mountains in the world. This led to many myths about mountain gods coming to be. It was believed that every mountain had a god guarding it and these gods differ from those who did good for the people and gods that did bad. There are four great Sacred Mountains and so each one of these Sacred mountains has a god along with another five famous Mountain Gods these together were named the Nine Creator-Gods, different areas of Tibet worship different gods. These Mountain Gods are not purely good but rather divided into good and bad. Gods that rose out of the rubble of old mountains were good and beneficial as they had to face challenges and hardships to emerge whilst those who rose out of lush green forests were viewed as evil since they were believed to have everything, to begin with. ===Chenrezig=== Often known as the Avalokiteśvara or Guanyin, this Bodhisattva is portrayed as either male or female depending on the culture in Tibetan culture Chenrezig is regarded as a male Bodhisatta. Chenrezig is said to personify the compassion of all Buddhas, this Bodhisattva in Tibetan mythology is said to have created Tara (Buddhism), the female bodhisattva of success with a single tear. This tear had fallen and when it landed it created a lake where Tãrã emerged from a lotus. ===Vajrapani=== Vajrapani has many forms in Tibetan mythology with the main ones being the Dharmapala or the Vajrapani-Acharya the deity is depicted in human form to possess a single head and a third eye and is wearing a necklace made out of snakes. Nilambara-Vajrapani is depicted as having either four or six hands and as having a head and a third eye wearing a crown of skulls. Mahachakra-Vajrapani is another form of the Vajrapani however unlike the previous forms this form has three heads, six arms, and two legs as well as a third eye and is holding a skull cup in his left hand. Many Buddhist statues as well as artworks depicting this deity is found in many countries including Nepal, Japan, India, and Cambodia. ===Jampelyang=== The Jampelyang also often known as Manjushri is the Bodhisattva of wisdom and insight and within Tibetan mythology is also said to have connections with Vajrayana Buddhism, the traditions of Tantra. Depicted to have been holding a sword in flames in his right hand to cut down ignorance and a lotus in the left hand as a symbol of fully blossomed wisdom. The Jampelyang is often featured in many Buddhist artworks and is often depicted with Chenrezig and Vajrapani as the family protector deities. ==Creatures== Different mythical creatures are often featured within Tibetan mythology, ranging from creatures that resemble animals like the snow lion to spirits. These creatures are present in both religious mythology as well as national mythology and are often a result of the Tibetan environment or are shared amongst many countries as a result of the spread of religion. ===The Yeti=== The Yeti is one of the most well-known mythical creatures around the world, Tibetan mythology also has a version of the Yeti myth alongside China and Russian myths.China Tibetology - China Tibetology Research Center - 2004 - Issues 2-3 - p. 86 \\"The goddess motif of Tibetan mythology is very unique (sic) and reflects the tradition and worship of the goddess age. It also shows that Tibetan culture is integrated with the Chinese matrimonial culture.\\" The large creature was said to resemble an ape and in recent years this myth has been adapted into different forms, like a kids’ movies such as Abominable (2019 film) or Smallfoot (2018 film). It was said to have been sighted in the snowy mountains around Tibet with tufts of orange fur and large footsteps being spotted in the snow. The reports of the Yeti in Western media had peaked around the 1950s when pictures were taken of these large footprints in the snow. ===The snow lion=== The Snow Lion is a celestial animal and the emblem of Tibet, its appearance is symbolic of the snowy mountain ranges that make up most of Tibet. It is thought to live in the highest mountains and the snow lion often makes appearances in other stories, this makes the snow lion often regarded as the king of beasts. The snow lion was present on coins, banknotes, postage stamps, and even on the national flag of Tibet. The Senggeh Garcham or the snow lion dance is still practiced in areas of Tibet and is a traditional Buddhist dance that is performed by monks. The snow lion, although vastly popular in Tibet, the snow lion is also present in Buddhism and so statues and art of the snow lion can also be seen within temples in China, Japan, India, and parts of different Himalayan regions. ===Wind Horse=== The Wind Horse stems from Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet. They were thought to be mighty creatures that are able to carry the wishes and prayers of the people to the Gods using the might of the wind. These mythical creatures are often present in prayer flags as a symbol of luck and believed to be able to change aspects of the world. Tibetan prayer flags stem from the Bon religion and are often strung around the mountains in Tibet and the greater Himalayan region in order to bless the regions. The flags are made of cloth and are often brightly colored and strung together with string. These flags for the wind horse are said to increase the positives in life and so are often strung in higher regions of the blessed areas such as treetops. ===Ghosts=== Other common Tibetan myths include Tibetan ghosts, this is often due to Buddhism and so there are many similarities to Indian ghost mythology. These include the hungry ghosts who are a symbol of greediness and unfulfillment of the tulpa which is a manifestation of high-ranking monks' wishes. These ghosts are deeply tied to the Tibetan culture with an annual religious ceremony being held near the end of the year for getting rid of all the negative energy, spirits, or bad luck in order to receive the new year. ==See also== * Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples * Several articles in German Wikipedia :de:Kategorie:Tibetische Mythologie ==References== ","title":"Tibetan mythology"},{"id":"7795659","text":"Piotr Nowina-Konopka (born 27 May 1949 in Chorzów) is a Polish academic, politician and diplomat. ==Academia== Konopka studied at the Sopot School of Economics, Gdańsk University, where he gained an MSc (1972) and a PhD (1978) in economics.

Tyler-Guidry attended J.P. Campbell College in Jackson and received an Associate of Arts Degree in Business and Secretarial Science degree. She then began working for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Tyler-Guidry held the women's voter registration chair. In 1964, she was hired by the Security Pacific Bank in California where she worked for twelve years. In 1977, Tyler-Guidry attended the Los Angeles Bible School to pursue the path of ministry, and was ordained as an itinerant Elder that year. Tyler-Guidry then served as the pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church in Indio, California, where she oversaw renovations to the church and parsonage, and the creation of a day care center. In 1983, she was appointed to the Cain Memorial A.M.E. Church in Bakersfield, California, where she served for five years. Cary B. Tyler, her first husband, died in 1988. In 1989, Tyler-Guidry became the first female to be appointed to a major metropolitan church when she was appointed to the Walker Temple A.M.E. Church, with 600 members, in Los Angeles. In 1994, she became the first female appointed to presiding elder in the Fifth Episcopal District. In this role she oversaw 19 churches in Los Angeles. Tyler-Guidry ran for election for bishop in 1996 and 2000; while her first two efforts were unsuccessful, her willingness to stand for election helped raise visibility for women clergy. In 2000, Vashti Murphy McKensie become the first woman elected bishop in the A.M.E. Church. In July 2004, Tyler-Guidry became the second woman to be elected as bishop in the A.M.E. Church.

Upon her election as bishop, Tyler-Guidry was appointed to serve as the presiding prelate of the 16th Episcopal district of the AME Church, comprising Suriname, Guyana, the Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba and London, England. Not long after she was appointed, Hurricane Ivan caused severe damage in the region, especially in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, which made her first months in office very hectic. In 2008, at the 48th Quadrennial Session of the General Conference of the AME Church, she was appointed to serve as bishop of the 8th Episcopal District, which comprises the US states of Louisiana and Mississippi. She retired in 2012. In addition to her ministry in the church, she has been actively involved in charitable and non-profit organizations.

He is the co-author of the books Driven to Distraction (1994) and Delivered From Distraction (2005). ==Background== Hallowell grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. His father suffered from bipolar disorder and had ECT.ADHD Nation - Schwarz (2016). Hallowell's mother remarried to an abusive alcoholic. ==Education== Hallowell is an alumnus of Harvard and Phillips Exeter Academy and received his medical degree from Tulane University Medical School.ADHD Nation - Alan Schwarz - 2016 He got a degree in English from the same University. ==ADHD== In 1981, Hallowell attended a lecture about children with ADHD and stated that it was there when he learned that he has the syndrome. Despite this, he has never been officially diagnosed. For the next ten years Hallowell diagnosed people with it using the Conner's Scale. In an interview in 2012, Hallowell stated that ADHD appears in 15% of the population. In a May 2015 interview, Hallowell said that the USA is full of ADHD genes coming from the colonizers and this could explain its 'thriving structure' in the way it behaves as well as being an explanation for being a violent nation. He calls this the \\"American Edge.\\" \\"The people who colonized this country were loaded with the ADHD genes, hence our current gene pool is well stocked with ADHD. It has driven our greatest successes – but is also why we are such a violent nation. Hallowell states that ADHD does not always include Hyperactivity but can include having an inability to follow through on assignments at work or at school, misplacing things, avoiding tasks, or getting distracted easily. Hallowell has claimed that Einstein, Mozart, Thomas Edison and Abraham Lincoln all had ADHD. ==Drug companies== Hallowell has been a paid consultant to and spokesperson for McNeil Pediatrics, a company that makes Concerta and other stimulants which Hallowell has praised along with Novartis.https://projects.propublica.org/d4d-archive/payments/10997328 ==Views on stimulant drugs== Hallowell has stated that Concerta, Adderall, Ritalin, and other ADHD drugs are \\"incredibly and unbelievably safe\\", \\"safer than aspirin\\", and are like \\"eye glasses\\". In 2012 Hallowell said \\"The fact is, stimulant medication is safer than aspirin. It has fewer side effects and works better than caffeine, and everybody goes to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. So, not to try it, unless it’s against your religion, makes no sense. People say, ‘Well, shouldn’t I try a year of non-medical approaches first?’ That's like saying shouldn't I try a year of squinting before I try eyeglasses. It just makes no sense. These meds are so well researched. They've been around since 1937. That's 70 years of experience. Nothing lasts that long unless it's safe and it works. Most entrepreneurs have ADHD. I think it should be renamed the entrepreneur's trait\\".http://www.celebritybrandingagency.com/pdf/drhallowell.pdf But he does not take them for his own ADHD. On September 15, 2005 Hallowell said \\"Whenever you get someone with ADHD diagnosed and treated successfully, everyone wins. Along with behavioral therapy, medication is good because it can improve adults' relationships, parenting skills, job performance, even their sex lives\\".Pittsburgh Morning Star - September 15, 2005 In June 2011 Hallowell claimed to have tested an eight-year-old boy with \\"An IQ of 69, close to mentally handicapped, and I put him on Ritalin and his IQ went up to 140. It was a dramatic story that I’ve never forgotten — to see how diagnosis could be a life-altering change in ability and stability\\". In February 2013 Hallowell on the Dr Oz show said he was \\"Speaking Hyperbolically\\" and \\"Took back\\" his long held claims about Adderall being safer than Aspirin. This was after he heard about the story of Richard Fee who got addicted to Adderall after wrongly being diagnosed with ADHD, went Psychotic and hanged himself. In June 2020 Hallowell claimed that ADHD was under diagnosed in the elderly and that the oldest person he treated was 86 years old. Once again he praised the safeness of stimulant medication.https://ihyper.net/adhd-in-the-elderly-dr- hallowell/ ==Sexual misconduct charge== In May 2015, Hallowell was charged with sexually groping a make up artist on 20 October 2014. Hallowell admitted having carried out this crime. The report said Hallowell confessed to putting his hand on the woman’s shoulder, moving his hand down along the side of her body, then grabbing and squeezing her buttocks.

The loss of solar heating has caused the Earth's atmosphere to freeze into thick layers of \\"snow\\". The boy's father had worked with a group of other scientists to construct a large shelter, but the earthquakes accompanying the disaster had destroyed it and killed the others. He managed to construct a smaller, makeshift shelter called the \\"Nest\\" for his family, where they maintain a breathable atmosphere by periodically retrieving pails of frozen oxygen to thaw over a fire. They have survived in this way for a number of years. At the end, they are found by a search party from a large group of survivors at Los Alamos, where they are using nuclear power to provide heat and have begun using rockets to search for other survivors (radio being ineffective at long range without an ionosphere). They reveal that other groups of humans have survived at Argonne, Brookhaven, and Harwell nuclear research facilities as well as in Tannu Tuva, and that plans are being made to establish uranium- mining colonies at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo region. ==Collections== The story is collected in The Best of Fritz Leiber, Constellations, and Fritz Leiber: Selected Stories (2010). ==See also== *Rogue planet ==External links== * * *Listen to A Pail of Air on X Minus One, NBC, 1956 *A Pail of Air at Project Gutenberg Category:1951 short stories Category:Black holes in fiction Category:Post-apocalyptic short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by Fritz Leiber Category:Works originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction ","title":"A Pail of Air"},{"id":"7795793","text":"The British Society for the History of Mathematics (BSHM) was founded in 1971 to promote research into the history of mathematics at all levels and to further the use of the history of mathematics in education.

The Learjet 29 is identical except for the addition of a long-range fuel tank, resulting in the reduction of the capacity to six (two crew and four passengers). Both were manufactured by Learjet and were marketed under the Longhorn name.A history of the LJ23-LJ29 series on Airliners.net ==History== The first flight of the Learjet 28 took place on August 24, 1977. FAA certification was awarded to both the Learjet 28 and 29 on July 29, 1979. The Learjet 28/29 was the first production jet aircraft to utilize winglets (entering service in 1977). The Learjet 28/29 was based on the Learjet 25, and received a completely new wing fitted with winglets which resulted in improved performance and fuel economy. Both models were commercially unsuccessful due to their outdated engines (noise and fuel consumption being too high). Only five production LearJet 28s, and four LearJet 29s, were constructed before production ceased in 1982. Both types were subsequently replaced by the Learjet 31. The first production aircraft was used by Neil Armstrong to set five aerospace records. ==Noise compliance== In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. The Learjet 28 is listed explicitly in Federal Register 78 FR 39576. Any Learjet 28s that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had \\"hushkits\\" installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015. 14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less – lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015. ==Specifications (Learjet 28)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Michell, Simon.

The Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) was the first Catholic university to open on the territory of the former Soviet Union. \\"History of the Ukrainian Catholic University.\\" Ukrainian Catholic University official website. URL accessed 5 November 2006 The university has 1900 students studying in six faculties. Professional degrees are offered in journalism and business; doctoral degrees in history and theology. In 2018 and 2019, UCU's entering students had the highest External independent evaluation scores in the country. ==History== ===Overview=== The Ukrainian Catholic University was created as the successor to the Greek Catholic Theological Academy created during 1928-1929 by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky in Lviv, at the time part of Poland. Josyf Slipyj became the academy's first rector. After its closure in 1944, the Ukrainian Catholic University in Rome, founded in 1963, continued the academy's functions under the leadership of Metropolitan Slipyj. In 1994, the original school was recreated under the name of Lviv Theological Academy, and in 1998 it became internationally recognized by the Congregation for Catholic Education. Then on June 28, 2002, the Ukrainian Catholic University was founded based on the Academy. \\"History of the Ukrainian Catholic University.\\" Ukrainian Catholic University official website. URL accessed 5 November 2006 ===Beginning and turmoil=== On October 6, 1929, the Greek Catholic Theological Academy was founded in Lviv. Under the guidance of rector Joseph Slipyj, the Academy became the center for theological and philosophic studies almost overnight. At the time, predominantly Ukrainian-populated Eastern Galicia was under the control of interwar Poland, and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained a strong Ukrainian national character. Since the Polish authorities did not allow the creation of a secular Ukrainian university, as that would have impeded their Polonization policies, the Academy became the sole Ukrainian institution of higher education on the territory of the Second Polish Republic. For the next ten years, the Academy continued to grow and expand by opening new departments, enlarging its library, and increasing its publishing capacity. In September 1939, when Eastern Galicia fell under the Soviet control, the Theological Academy was closed and its students arrested or deported. On September 15, 1941, shortly after the onset of the German invasion of the USSR, the Academy's Church of the Holy Spirit and the library were ruined by German bombings. Limited studies resumed under German occupation during the Second World War. Out of 500 students who studied at the Academy between 1941–1944, only 60 received diplomas. After the Red Army offensive recovered Lviv for the Soviets in the spring of 1945, the Theological Academy was closed, this time for decades, while many of its graduates and professors ended up in the Gulag system of prison camps. Soon afterwards at the Lviv Synod held in March 1946 under the pressure of the Soviet authorities, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was forcibly \\"united\\" with the recently recreated Ukrainian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church. The theological education under the UGCC, which formally \\"ceased to exist\\" in the USSR (but in reality was banned), was restricted to the underground, as well as the entire UGCC church as a whole. This period is known as the Church of the Catacombs in UGCC history. ===Renewal=== A new chapter in the UCU history began after Ukraine attained its independence in the wake of the 1991 Soviet collapse. In September 1994, the Lviv Theological Academy (LTA) was opened. In 1998 the LTA was recognized by the Congregation for Catholic Education.\\"Congregation for Catholic Education.\\" Vatican official website. URL accessed on 5 November, 2006 The first graduation took place in the summer of 1999, with twenty-eight graduates receiving their degrees. This marked a significant milestone for the school as well as for theological education in Ukraine in general. For the first time: * laity received a Bachelor of Arts degree from a Ukrainian theological school at a post-secondary level; * women in Ukraine received a degree in theology. ===Ukrainian Catholic University=== Andrey Sheptytsky Centre The UCU came into existence on the foundation prepared for it by the Lviv Theological Academy. On his visit to Ukraine on June 26, 2001, Pope John Paul II blessed the future university's cornerstone. The ceremonial inauguration honoring its founding took place on June 29, 2002. It was the first university opened by one of the Eastern Catholic Churches, rather than by a religious order. The founding is seen by the university community as a culmination of efforts by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) and Ukrainian academics to create an educational institution, which would grow on the foundation of \\"Christian spirituality, culture and worldview\\". \\"I consider this project one of the most successful in the field of Ukrainian education\\", said Vyacheslav Bryukhovetskyy, President of the National University of Kyiv- Mohyla Academy, after the establishment of the Lviv Theological Academy and its subsequent transformation into the Ukrainian Catholic University. The Rector Rev. Borys Gudziak expressed his hope that UCU would be a center for cultural thought and the formation of the new Ukrainian society based on human dignity. In cooperation with the Institute of Religion and Society of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Catholic University established and runs the Religious Information Service of Ukraine with a multilingual Web Portal.Religious Information Service of Ukraine, About RISU In 2004, the Institute of Ecumenical Studies was established. ==Foundations and branches== * UCU Kyiv Centre * Ukrainian Catholic Education Foundation – USA * The Institute of Pope Clement in Rome * The Ukrainian Institute in London * Ukrainian Catholic Education Foundation – Canada * Patriarch Josyf Slipyj Institute of Ukrainian Culture, UCU’s branch in Argentina * Lviv Business School of UCU === UCU Entrepreneurship Center === In April 2020, the UCU Entrepreneurship Center signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Ukrainian Startup Fund. ==References== ==External links== *Ukrainian Catholic University Category:Educational institutions established in 1929 Category:Universities and colleges in Lviv Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Ukraine Category:Greek Catholic universities and academies in Ukraine ","title":"Ukrainian Catholic University"},{"id":"7795840","text":"\\"The Things That I Used to Do\\" is a blues standard written by Guitar Slim. He recorded it in New Orleans, where the young Ray Charles arranged and produced the session. Specialty Records released the song as a single in 1953 and became a bestseller the following year. Specialty founder Art Rupe believed that the appeal would be limited to the Southern U.S. rural audience. However, urban rhythm and blues radio stations in the North began airing the song and built it into a national hit. As a result, Guitar Slim became in great demand as a performer and played at venues such as the Apollo Theater in New York City. The single was one of the biggest hits in Specialty's history and stayed on the Billboard's Rhythm and Blues Records charts for 42 weeks. The song remained at number one for six weeks and was the best-selling R&B; record of the year, selling more than a million copies. ==Composition and recording== Charles's arrangement and piano accompaniment emphasize the religious tone of intense but philosophical regret in the singer's voice, giving the song a gospel-influenced feel. Like Fats Domino, Guitar Slim had a voice with a less adult sound than that of the typical blues shouters of the time, and his lyrics are less explicitly sexual. ==Influence and recognition== The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included the tune on its list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". Stylistically, the song also contributed to the development of soul music. In addition, the song was a success, influencing rock and roll by demonstrating the commercial success of using content that appeals to white listeners and by the effectiveness of its gospel feel. It has become a standard as a result of Guitar Slim's distinctive guitar figuring and the rising and falling melody. The song had a major impact on the \\"electric sound\\" of rock music and featured distorted overtones on the electric guitar a full decade before Jimi Hendrix. In 1964, a version by James Brown cracked the Billboard Hot 100 at number 99 (the magazine's R&B; chart was suspended at the time). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1953 songs Category:1953 singles Category:1954 singles Category:1963 singles Category:Junior Parker songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Blues songs Category:Specialty Records singles ","title":"The Things That I Used to Do"},{"id":"7795846","text":"The Morongo Unified School District (MUSD) is a public education governing body in the Mojave high desert of Southern California.

He is also sometimes referred to as C. Leonard Huskins or C.L. Huskins. Huskins was born in Walsall, England and moved with his family at the age of 9 to Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. He served in the Canadian Infantry and as an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps (which became the RAF) in World War I. After the war Huskins returned to Canada and enrolled in the University of Alberta from which he received his Bachelor's degree in 1923 and his Master's degree in 1925. With the aid of a scholarship for graduate study abroad, he went to England where he obtained his Ph.D. from King's College London in 1927. Huskins stayed on in England from 1927 to 1930 to do research with the renowned geneticist William Bateson at what is now the John Innes Centre. In 1930 Huskins returned to Canada to teach at McGill University in Montreal. He taught initially (1930-1934) in the Department of Botany and then (1934-1945) as Professor in the Department of Genetics, the first head of a Department of Genetics in Canada. In 1945 he left McGill for the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he was Professor of Botany until his death. In 1942-1943 Huskins spent a year at Columbia University on a Guggenheim Fellowship he was awarded \\"to prepare a book on the cytology and genetics of plants, animals and man.\\" Except for that year, he spent essentially all of his career at McGill and Wisconsin. Huskins worked at first on mutations in oats and wheat. At the Innes Centre he studied a species of the grass Spartina (cordgrass) and showed that a suspected hybrid had undergone chromosome doubling in the course of evolution, one of the first demonstrations of this phenomenon. He then went on to do research on chromosome synapsis and crossing-over in higher plants, grasshoppers and mice. Huskins and F. M. Hearne published the first studies on the cytology of the grasshopper in 1935 and in 1936 they published on animal cytology (on chiasma frequencies in mice). The Genetics Society of Canada established the Huskins Memorial Lecture in his honor and there is the C.

He is best remembered for his forty years of tennis coverage on BBC Radio. ==Life and career== Robertson was born in Dacca, Bengal to British parents. The family moved back to England when he was seven years old, he then attended Haileybury, the independent school. In 1935 he left Clare College, Cambridge, for an expedition to Papua New Guinea. Afterwards he spent a few years in Sydney, where he worked as a schoolmaster. In 1937 Robertson gained his first job in broadcasting with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The first main tennis event he covered was the final of the Australian Open between Vivian McGrath and Jack Bromwich. Robertson returned to England in 1939 and spent the war years in the army. He joined the BBC in 1946, covering not only tennis but also athletics, swimming, skiing and even sports he had no genuine interest in, like motor racing. His style of commentary was much livelier than what BBC listeners were used to in the pre-war years. It gained him enough popularity for BBC staff to give him other assignments. In 1953 Robertson became the first regular host of the television series Panorama, which was not originally the heavyweight current affairs programme it became. He was also a commentator at major news events like the funeral of King George VI in 1952 and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II a year later. From 1965 to 1977 he presented the television programme about antiques Going for a Song. During his long career Robertson made the occasional blooper. In the early 1980s he was watching a men's doubles match at Wimbledon, and was so impressed by the play of Peter Fleming and John McEnroe that he asked, \\"Who are they going to play in the final? Do we know yet?\\", to which his astonished colleague replied, \\"This is the final...\\" Unable to pronounce the name of Serbian player Slobodan Živojinović, he settled, to the bewilderment of his colleagues and the audience, on 'Bobo'. This was what he thought to be Živojinović's nickname; it is in fact Boba. Robertson also wrote a number of books, mainly about sports and antiques, his best known work probably being Wimbledon 1877-1977. He retired in 1986 after describing Boris Becker's second Wimbledon victory: \\"Beckermania forever! Becker the Boy King last year, now King Emperor...\\". Robertson lived in Guernsey during the latter years of his life. Both his marriages ended in divorce. He had two sons by his first wife, Australian Nancy Suttor. He had a son and daughter by his second wife, children's author and creator of the Wombles, Elisabeth Beresford; they were married from 1949 until 1984.Childs, M.

The operations were carried out by the Imperial Japanese Kwantung Army and the collaborationist forces of the Manchukuo government from March 1932 until 1942, and resulted in a Japanese victory. == Japan seizes control == The earliest formation of large anti-Japanese partisan groups occurred in Liaoning and Kirin provinces due to the poor performance of the Fengtien Army in the first month of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and to Japan's rapid success in removing and replacing the provincial authority in Fengtien and Kirin. The provincial government of Liaoning Province had fled west to Chinchow. Governor Zang Shiyi remained in Mukden, but refused to cooperate with the Japanese in establishing a separatist and collaborationist government and was imprisoned. The Kwantung Army issued a proclamation on 21 September 1931 installing Colonel Kenji Doihara as Mayor of Mukden; he proceeded to rule the city with the aid of an \\"Emergency Committee\\" composed mostly of Japanese. On 23 September 1931, Lieutenant General Xi Qia of the Kirin Army was invited by the Japanese to form a provisional government for Kirin Province. In Kirin, the Japanese succeeded in achieving a bloodless occupation of the capital. General Xi Qia issued a proclamation on 30 September, declaring the province independent of the Republic of China under protection of the Japanese Army. On 24 September 1931, a provisional government was formed in Fengtien (the new name of the former Liaoning Province) with Yuan Chin-hai as Chairman of the \\"Committee for the Maintenance of Peace and Order\\". In Harbin, General Chang Ching-hui also called a conference on 27 September 1931 to discuss the organization of an \\"Emergency Committee of the Special District\\", formed to achieve the secession of Harbin from China. However he was not able to act as much of the area surrounding Harbin was still held by anti-Japanese militias under Generals Ting Chao, Li Du, Feng Zhanhai and others. Meanwhile, in Mukden, the \\"North Eastern Administrative Committee,\\" or Self-Government Guiding Board, was set up on November 10 under the leadership of Yu Chung-han, a prominent elder statesman of Zhang Xueliang's Government, who favored the autonomy of Manchuria. After the Japanese defeated General Ma Zhanshan and occupied Tsitsihar on 19 November 1931, a local Self-Government Association was established in Heilungkiang Province; and General Chang Ching-hui was inaugurated as Governor of the Province on 1 January 1932. After the fall of Chinchow, the independence movement made rapid progress in northern Manchuria, where Colonel Doihara was Chief of Special Services in Harbin. General Chang Ching-hui, upon learning of the defeat of Marshal Zhang Xueliang at Chinchow, agreed to the request of the Self-Government Guiding Board at Mukden and declared the independence of Heilungkiang Province on 7 January 1932. After General Ma Zhanshan had been driven from Tsitsihar by the Japanese in the Jiangqiao Campaign he had retreated northeastward with his beaten and depleted forces and had set up his capital at Hailun. There he attempted to continue to govern Heilongjiang province. Colonel Kenji Doihara began negotiations with General Ma from his Special Service Office at Harbin, hoping to get him to join the new state of Manchukuo Japan was organizing. Ma continued negotiating with Doihara, while he continued to support General Ting Chao. == Early resistance: militias, brotherhoods and bandits == The emergence of Chinese resistance to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in the form of citizen militias, peasant brotherhoods and bandit gangs was facilitated by Japan's success in rapidly destroying Zhang Xueliang's government in the region. Most of the Kwantung Army's strength during November 1931 was concentrated against General Ma Zhanshan in north-central Heilungkiang, and in December and early January against Zhang Xueliang's remaining army in Chinchow in southwestern Liaoning. Away from the Japanese garrisons in cities and along the railroads, resistance units mustered openly and relatively free from molestation in late 1931-early 1932. === Militias === The frontier status of Manchuria, with endemic banditry and activities by opposing warlords, led leading citizens and village authorities to form private militias for the protection of their property and landholdings even before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After the start of the Japanese occupation, these militias became partisan bands, often known as \\"plain-clothes\\" men from their lack of uniforms, and styled themselves with various names, such as the \\"Self-Protection Militia\\", \\"Anti-Japanese Militia\\" or \\"Chinese Volunteers\\". One of the first such forces to form, called the Courageous Citizens Militia, had been established by November 1931 near the estuary port of Chinchow. These militias operated principally in southern Fengtien, which had half of Manchuria's population and the highest proportion of Han Chinese. Fengtien had come almost immediately under Japanese control, as most population centers and its capital of Mukden all lay along the tracks of the South Manchuria Railway in the S.M.R. Zone, which had been garrisoned by Kwantung Army troops since long before the conflict. === Peasant brotherhoods === \\"Peasant brotherhoods\\" were a traditional form of mutual protection by Chinese small-holders and tenant farmers. Waves of immigrants fleeing the wars of the Warlord era that ravaged north and central China came to Manchuria since 1926 at the rate of one million a year. These included many peasants belonging to the two predominant brotherhoods, the Red Spear Society and the Big Swords Society, which aided the immigrants in establishing themselves and provided for protection against both bandits and rapacious landlords. The Red Spear Society was strongest in the hinterlands of Fengtien and countryside around Harbin. The Big Swords Society predominated in southeastern Kirin and adjoining parts of Fengtien. In 1927, the Big Swords had spearheaded an uprising triggered by the collapse of the prevailing Feng-Piao paper currency. During the rebellion the Big Swords were respected by the peasants because they did not harm or plunder the common people, but resisted the officials of the warlord Zhang Zuolin. After the Japanese invasion, the Big Swords Society disturbed the Chientao District in southeast Fengtien along the Korean border, and rose en masse in response to the declaration of Manchukuo on March 9, 1932. The Big Swords became the principal component of partisan resistance in this region, forming loose ties with the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies. The bandit leader Lao Pie-fang commanded several bands of Big Swords in western Fengtien. The Big Swords in southeast Kirin were allied with Wang Delin, and General Feng Zhanhai organized and trained a Big Sword Corps of 4,000 men. The Red Spear Society groups were more widespread. Members formed important centers of resistance as the war spread out through the countryside. Red Spears frequently attacked the S.M.R. Zone from the Hsinlintun and Tungfeng districts, close to Mukden and the Fushun coal mines. They were led by a young officer of the Fengtien Army, Tang Juwu. Red Spear Society units displayed extraordinary staying power in this area; almost two years after the Mukden Incident, a group of 1,000 Red Spear members stormed the Tungfeng prefecture near Mukden on June 3, 1933, long after the large Volunteer Armies had been defeated. However, both the Red Spear Society and the Big Sword Society were made up largely of uneducated and poorly trained peasants, and had a traditionalist, quasi-religious character. Members of the brotherhoods placed their faith in rustic magic and belief in the righteous character's Heavenly reward. Big Sword members claimed that their spells made them immune to bullets. Red Spear bands were in many cases led by Buddhist monks as they went into battle, with their clothes and weapons decorated with magic inscriptions similar to that of the earlier Boxer Society. === Bandits === Weapons of Manchurian bandits Northeastern China was a poorly-governed frontier area at the turn of the 20th century and banditry was endemic. Some were hardened criminals who pillaged for a living; others were part-time bandits who robbed only to survive when crops failed and they could not make a living on the land. As the population of Manchuria increased through the 1920s, some newcomers became squatters, then wanderers, and then outlaws. Even in the settled Fengtien province, bandits known as Hun-hutze (\\"red beards\\") were common along the Peiping–Mukden railway and in the wooded southeast of the province along the Mukden-Antung railway near Korea. Powerful bandit gangs operated within a day's march of such major cities as Mukden and Harbin. The term \\"shanlin\\" was often used to describe the bandits because they knew the local terrain very well. Most operated in a fairly small area and maintained the goodwill of local peasants. Government troops had great difficulty in suppressing them as would the Japanese and Manchukuo forces in later years. There was also a tradition of nationalistic banditry, dating back to the Russian invasion in July 1900 when Tsarist forces were sent to Manchuria, ostensibly to protect the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway after the Boxer Rebellion. Wang Delin, who opposed both the Russians and the Qing dynasty, led a major bandit force against the Russians. His career as an outlaw continued until 1917, when he agreed to join the Jilin provincial forces. For former bandits to join the regular army was quite common in the Warlord Era, as the bandits formed a convenient source of new soldiers. The converse was true as well. As the Fengtien Army retreated from the Japanese onslaught, thousands of soldiers deserted into the countryside to resume their former careers as bandits. During the Russo-Japanese War, many bandit groups actively cooperated with the Japanese Army, providing valuable military intelligence on Russian troop movements and deployment, and assisting in the securing of supplies. After December 1931, the Japanese Army began operations \\"for the clearance of bandits\\" into the Fengtien countryside beyond the South Manchuria Railway Zone in counties west of Mukden, largely due to repeated bandit attacks, robberies and kidnappings on the Dalian-Mukden trains. Fighting supported by aircraft reportedly broke up several of the bandit gangs. In consequence bandits now resented the Japanese invasion, and began retaliatory attacks against isolated Japanese communities along the Mukden- Antung railway. Hun-hutze chieftain Lao Pie-fang led several thousand followers to attack the southern portion of the S.M.R. mainline. The Japanese garrison of Newchwangcheng (zh) was encircled and attacked by \\"1500 Chinese bandits under Lao Pie-fang,\\" while other troops under his orders attacked in the Haicheng area. Japanese reinforcements quickly dispatched from Mukden forced Lao's retirement, but Lao Pie-fang re-emerged later as a Volunteer Army general, and was acclaimed as commander by both local Peasant Brotherhoods and Anti-Japanese militias. Many bandits were admitted into the Volunteer Armies as the Japanese conquest advanced and the partisan resistance became an increasingly popular cause. Some professional bandits such as 'Old North Wind' Zhang Haitian, led their followers against Japan, but just as often continued to loot villages along the railway. == Formation of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies == === Resistance in Harbin === When General Xi Qia of the Kirin Army declared the province independent of the Republic of China, military and civil authorities in the province fractured into \\"New Kirin\\" adherents of his regime and loyalist \\"Old Kirin\\" elements in opposition to it; the former predominated near the capital and the latter predominated in Harbin and the rugged hinterland to the north and east. Hostilities did not commence in the Harbin area until the end of January 1932, at about the same time as the January 28 Incident. General Ting Chao decided to defend the city, a key hub of rail and river communications in the north, against the approach of first General Xi Qia's \\"New Kirin\\" Army and then Japanese troops. He appealed to Harbin's Chinese residents to join his railway garrison regulars, and hundreds of volunteers joined the Jilin Self-Defence Army. The Defense of Harbin at the start of February, that rallied Harbin in the way that had already formed militias in Fengtien, convinced local authorities and leading citizens in the hinterlands of Kirin that they should resist Japan's occupation of the province and form their own bands and militia units. General Ting Chao's beaten Jilin Self-Defence Army retired from Harbin to the northeast down the Sungari River, to join the Lower Sungari garrison of General Li Du to form the nucleus of armed opposition in north Kirin. Meanwhile, in southeast Kirin Wang Delin, a battalion commander and former bandit chieftain in the region established the Chinese People's National Salvation Army or NSA, on February 8, 1932. Numbering over 1,000 men at the time, within a few months this army became a rallying point for resistance and one of the most successful of the volunteer armies. === Foundation of Manchukuo === Puyi, Emperor of Manchukuo Manchukuo Honor Guard With General Ting Chao defeated, Ma Zhanshan agreed to defect to the new Manchukuo Imperial Army on 14 February 1932 and retained his post as Governor of Heilungkiang Province in exchange for cooperating with the Japanese. On February 27, 1932, General Ting Chao offered to cease hostilities, ending official Chinese resistance in Manchuria. Within days Henry Puyi, the Manchurian former emperor of China deposed in 1911, was made provisional president of the independent state of Manchukuo by the resolution of an All-Manchuria convention at Mukden, whose members included General Ma Zhanshan flown in from the north. The next day on March 1 the provisional Manchukuo Government was established with Ma Zhanshan as its Minister of War, in addition to his post as provincial governor. On March 9, the State of Manchukuo was inaugurated. The Chinese Government announced that not only did it not recognize the new state, but asserted that Puyi been kidnapped by the Japanese. Despite the end of official resistance with the defeat of General Ting Chao, all was not calm in Manchuria. In late February General Wang Delin with 1,000 militia wrecked or burned 18 bridges on the Kirin-Tunhua Railway. Wang also recaptured the town of Dunhua on February 20. In March 1932 a Japanese and Manchukuo expeditionary force sent against Wang was defeated in a series of battles around the shore of Lake Jingbo losing hundreds of casualties. These battles were small in scale, with the militias using their knowledge of the local terrain to set ambushes, eventually compelling the Japanese to retreat to Harbin. That the Japanese had suffered a military defeat at the hands of a motley collection of irregular forces was a considerable political embarrassment. Japan was anxious to present Manchukuo to the world as a peaceful nation, especially as a League of Nations delegation was now investigating the situation. When the news of the victories of Wang's Chinese People's National Salvation Army spread around eastern Kirin, hundreds of troops who had been reluctant members of the new Manchukuo Imperial Army defected to the NSA and estimates of its total strength in April rose from 4,500 to above 10,000 and, possibly nearer 15,000 organized in five brigades. == War of the Volunteer Armies and \\"Anti-bandit Operations\\" 1932 - 1933 == === The conflict begins === Following the establishment of Manchukuo, fires were set in the Japanese quarter of Mukden. General Honjo's train suffered an attack which was repulsed, and minor revolts began in the remoter parts of Manchuria. With the end of winter in 1932, the Japanese launched expeditions from Harbin into the interior of Kirin province, striking northeast down the Sungari River and east along the Chinese Eastern Railway mainline against General Ting's Jilin Self-Defence Army, (called the \\"Anti-Kirin Army\\" by the Japanese). This was the Subjugation of the Anti-Kirin Army campaign in Kirin province that lasted from March to June 1932. The campaign pushed the Jilin forces into the north and east of the Kirin province and secured control of the Sungari River, however, Ting's forces continued to resist, sometimes occupying towns along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, between Harbin and the Soviet border. To the southwest another force under General Li Hai-ching headquartered at Fuyu was in control of the territory round about and southward as far as Nungan. This force was called the Anti-Japanese Army For The Salvation Of The Country and equipped with light artillery and numerous machine guns. On March 29, 1932 Li Hai- ching's forces defeated regular troops of the Manchukuo Governor Xi Qia outside the town of Nungan, only from the capital of Shinkyo. On previous day, a party of 100 policemen was surrounded by volunteer troops in the afternoon as they were proceeding to Nungan in a truck convoy carrying 200,000 rounds of rifle ammunition and 50,000 trench mortar shells from the Kirin City Arsenal. All were either taken prisoner or surrendered. Deprived of their supply of ammunition, the resistance of Manchukuo forces in Nungan dissolved next day. Nungan was soon reported on the verge of surrender. Small Japanese detachments sent from Changchun radioed for help, after suffering heavy casualties in the fighting. Japanese forces from the east at Yao-men, tried to fight their way through to Nungan with the support of bombers, but the defenders radio ceased broadcasting, Li's Anti-Japanese Army having captured the town. Finally the next day, the Japanese succeeded in driving Li's forces out of the town mainly as a result of airplane bombing, against which they had little defense. === The Revolt of Ma Zhanshan === Despite being appointed Minister of War in the Manchukuo government and provincial governor, Muslim General Ma Zhanshan was kept under very strict control by the Japanese military. He had to ask for approval from his Japanese advisor on all matters regarding the provincial administration. Dissatisfied with the situation, Ma raised and re-equipped his private army in secret using Japanese money and weapons. As the Governor of Heilungkiang, he used his authority to secretly transport weapons and ammunition out of the arsenals and evacuated the wives and families of his troops to safety. He then led his troops out of Tsitsihar on April 1, stating that he was going on a military inspection tour. At Heihe on April 7, Ma announced the reestablishment of the \\"Heilungkiang Provincial Government\\" independent of Manchukuo, and reorganized his troops into 9 brigades at the beginning of May. Ma also established another eleven troops of volunteers at Buxi, Gannan, Keshan, Kedong and other places. This became the Northeast Anti- Japanese National Salvation Army. Ma was also appointed nominal commander-in- chief, over all other Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that were forming in various locations, and commanded a total fighting force of about 300,000 men at peak strength according to Japanese estimates. After sending some troops to aid General Ting Chao in the lower Sungari River area, Ma struck out toward Harbin with six infantry and cavalry regiments, 20 field artillery pieces and a small squadron of seven planes. His units set ambushes along major roads and badly mauled Manchukuo and Japanese troops. When he was blocked from reaching Harbin, he turned southwest towards Tsitsihar. At the same time northwest of Harbin, irregular war began to flare up in the countryside of Heilungkiang province. Manchukuo troops mutinied, briefly holding the transportation hubs along the Tsitsihar-Keshan and Harbin-Hailun railways, or departing to join the forces of General Ma. Mounted bandits appeared by the hundreds to loot towns on the Chinese Eastern Railway mainline west of Harbin. Other partisans rose up in the Taonan region, disrupting service on the Taonan-Tsitsihar railway. To restore control, the Japanese Army launched the Ma Chan-shan Subjugation campaign from April through July 1932. The Japanese struck northwards up the Harbin-Hailun and Tsitsihar-Keshan railways, driving back General Ma's forces, and setting out from the railheads in powerful pincer movements to encircle groups of Ma's troops. General Ma reported on June 8 that he had decided to adopt guerrilla warfare tactics, retaining only one detachment of 1,000 soldiers as his personal command as a regular force. All other units were dispersed as small groups of partisans, roving countryside on horseback. By July, General Ma Zhanshan's troops were seriously depleted in the resulting battles, and only small numbers of men were able to break through the tight Japanese encirclement. General Ma Zhanshan commanded 3,500 guerilla fighters against the Japanese, conducting attacks such as a raid on the Manchukuo treasury, attacking Changchun, the capital, and hijacking from an airfield six Japanese planes. General Ma caused so much trouble to the Japanese, that when his equipment and horse were captured, the Japanese presented them to the Emperor in Tokyo, assuming that he was dead. They were enraged to discover that he had survived and escaped. After General Ma escaped, his men kept up the fight, terrorizing the Japanese invaders. They seized 350 Japanese and Korean hostages and held them for weeks and kidnapped foreigners such as a British General's son and an American executive's wife. === Revolts of the Volunteer Armies south of Harbin === In late April, the Chinese Eastern Railway was cut south of Harbin, by an estimated 3,000 Chinese soldiers under General Li Hai-ching. Li's troops ripped up the railway tracks, tore down telegraph wires, and captured a train from Harbin. They looted the train and dispersed before Japanese troops arrived on the scene. In eastern Manchukuo, Wang Delin's troops set three minor railway stations afire and gutted the city of Suifenho near the Russian border. Drawing more troops from the seemingly quiet southern Fengtien province, the Japanese launched the Li Hai-ching Subjugation Operation in May 1932. A mixed force of Japanese and Manchukuo troops attacked Li Hai-ching's guerrillas in southern Heilungkiang province from three directions, rapidly dispersing them and securing control of the region. However, in May 1932, with Japanese forces concentrated in the north, Tang Juwu in eastern Liaoning judged that the time was ripe for his army to go on the offensive. Tang's army, numbering 20,000 men surrounded the Japanese Tunghua garrison. In reaction the Manchukuo police and detachments of the Manchukuo Army attempted to relieve the siege in the First Tungpientao Clearance. They were unable to defeat Tang but did relieve the siege. However his force continued as a threat in the region to the east of Mukden and communications with Korea. Based in the Tungpientao area, his army fought with both the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Mukden and the Manchukuo Fengtian Army. Although all major cities had been lost, the volunteer armies gained a new lease of life during the summer of 1932 and reached their greatest strength. Also in May, Feng Zhanhai and a sizeable detachment of the Jilin Self-Defence Army of 15,000 men in western Kirin province cut communications to the south and east of Harbin. In response the Japanese and Manchukuo armies launched two campaigns to clear Feng's force out of the countryside. From June to July 1932 the Feng Chan-hai Subjugation Operation cleared the Shuangcheng, Acheng, Yushu, Wuchang, and Shulan districts south of Harbin, of Feng's Anti- Japanese forces and forced Feng to retreat to the west. Massive floods along the Nonni and Sungari Rivers inundated some round Harbin throughout August, providing a crucial breathing spell to Volunteer Army bands in the plains and lower Sungari, Japanese operations in the area had to halt until the waters subsided. The Japanese concentrated forces northwest of Harbin against General Ma Zhanshan in spring and summer of 1932, which permitted an escalation of partisan activity in Kirin and Fengtien provinces, which culminated in simultaneous attacks on cities throughout the South Manchurian Railway Zone when the August floods both halted Japanese operations based on Harbin, and isolated the troops engaged on them. However, the floods also ruined crops not already destroyed in the war, putting more pressure on the Volunteer Armies, which foraged for their sustenance in the countryside. === Defeat of the Volunteer Armies === Mongolian bandit forces were able to attack the Ssutao (Siping - Taonan) Railway where it was isolated by the flooding in August, and took the small town of Tongyu. On August 20 a Manchukuo relieving force was sent on the Mongolian Bandit Subjugation Operation and after a short battle Tonyu was recovered on August 31, 1932. On September 2, 1932 during the Second Feng Chan-hai Subjugation operation a force of the Manchukuo Kirin Guard Army cornered Feng Zhanhai's Volunteer Army retreating from the previous subjugation operation. Although surrounded, over half the guerrillas were able to slip through the encirclement and make good their escape to Jehol. ==== Su Bingwen's revolt ==== General Su Bingwen the \\"Barga District\\" at the extreme west of Heilungkiang on the Soviet frontier, had kept his isolated command beyond the Hsingan Mountains, free any of the fighting or any Japanese troops, doing nothing in support of either Manchukuo or Ma Zhanshan. As a consequence the farmers settled along the Chinese Eastern Railway mainline west of Tsitsihar had remained undisturbed by warfare and were able to get in their harvests. On September 27, 1932 when the Japanese turned their attention south to restore the security of the vital facilities in the southern Manchukuo which were endangered by the activities of the Volunteer Armies, General Su Bingwen's soldiers staged a mutiny, seizing hundreds of Japanese civilians and isolated military personnel as hostages. The mutineers, calling themselves the Heilungkiang National Salvation Army moved eastwards aboard trains to join General Ma Zhanshan in recapturing the provincial capital of Tsitsihar. Ma Zhanshan had emerged onto the plains again from his shelter in the Lesser Khingan mountains along the Amur River after the Japanese had defeated his forces in the north. He arrived in Longmen County in September and joined Su Bingwen's mutineers for a joint campaign. However food shortages were particularly acute in Heilungkiang after the devastation wrought by the August flooding. The Heilungkiang troops and Ma's Army were being supplied with provisions commandeered unwillingly from local farmers, and soon there was nothing left to seize. In mid-October, Ma's forces captured Antachen west of Harbin on the C. E. R. mainline, forced the merchants of the city to give 50,000 dollars to them, and confiscated every horse they could find. On October 26 Laha, a town north of Tsitsihar, was attacked by Ma's forces with their remaining artillery in support. The Japanese garrison was subjected to a long, intensive, and well-directed bombardment. For eight days the Japanese garrison commanded by a Captain Hayashi at Taian on the Tsitsihar-Koshen railway was encircled by some 4,000 Volunteers, until it succeeded in repulsing them on October 28 following severe fighting, in which twenty eight Japanese (including Captain Hayashi) were killed or wounded. A cavalry detachment, the Kawase Detachment of 59 horsemen sent out toward Taian, disappeared on the frosted prairie. On November 8 the sole survivor, a Sergeant Iwakami, arrived in Tsitsihar to tell how the detachment had been annihilated outside Taian. In reaction, the Japanese organized the Su Ping-wei Subjugation Campaign from November to December 1932. Nearly 30,000 Japanese and Manchukuo soldiers including the Japanese 14th Infantry Division and Mongol cavalrymen of the Manchukuo Hsingan Army directed a fierce campaign against Su and Ma's troops. On November 28, 1932, Japanese 14th division attacked Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen around Tsitsihar. Japanese planes bombed Ma Zhanshan's headquarters in Hailar. By December 3, the Japanese took Ma Zhanshan's Hailar headquarters. And the following day, after heavy fighting, Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen with the remnants of their forces fled Hailar for the Soviet border and entered Russian territory on December 5. Most of their troops were later transferred to Rehe. ==== Final Operations in eastern Manchukuo ==== Diverted from their preparations for invading Jehol province by the widespread partisan activity by the forces of Ma and Su in Heilungkiang, Japanese forces concentrated to the west. The forces of Feng Zhanhai and Wang Delin in Fengtian and Kirin were thus free to attack the railroads and other places in the South Manchuria Railway Zone and managed to briefly occupy the capital of Kirin province. On September 10, 1932, at Yaomin on the C. E. R. spur-line between Changchun and Harbin, 1,000 bandits drove out the Manchukuo garrison. They then looted the town for two hours as fighting went on. The garrison was able to rally and counterattack and repulse their opponents. On a raid on September 11, Volunteer Army partisans derailed a train between Changchun and Harbin and robbed the survivors, kidnapping some for ransom, including five Japanese. On September 15, a Red Spear militia not from the area, but merely passing through Pingdingshan village, fired on Japanese soldiers and later had attacked the Japanese garrison in the nearby industrial city of Fushun. The next day in retaliation Japanese soldiers and police in tracking the rebels as they fled back through the villages, assumed all who were in the vicinity either to be members of the militia or their confederates and punished them, by burning homes and summary execution, bayoneting and machine-gunning village residents and killing some 3,000 men, women, and children, leaving only one survivor in the whole village. This became known as the Pingdingshan Massacre.Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Meanwhile, in October to the west, a Manchukuo and Japanese force in the Li Hai-ching Subjugation, confronted the 3,000 man Li Hai-ching guerrilla force that had returned to attack Manchukuo and Japanese forces in south Heilungkiang province and forced their retreat into Jehol province. Finally the Japanese took the initiative in the east. In mid-October, the Japanese estimated Tang Juwu's forces in the fourteen counties of south and eastern Fengtien at about 30,000 men. On October 11, 1932, the Japanese counterattacked in the Second Tungpientao Subjugation. The Fengtian Army of seven brigades supported a Japanese force of two cavalry brigades and one mixed brigade that spearheaded the clearance of guerrillas from the Tungpientao district. They attacked Tang Juwu's forces in the Tonghua and Huanren area. Tang Juwu broke through the Japanese encirclement to the west. On the 16th, the Japanese took over Tonghua, and on the 17th, Huanren, suffering casualties of 500 men while killing 270 and capturing 1,000. Following that operation up from October to November 1932 in the Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin Subjugation the Japanese swept through the territory between Mukden, Changchun and Kirin, and forcing the Chinese guerrilla forces of Wang Delin to retreat towards Huinan and Siping. From November 6 to November 20, 1932 the Manchukuo Army launched the Ki Feng - Lung District Subjugation Operation clearing the Ki Feng-lung district of guerrillas with 5,000 Manchukuo soldiers consisting of a battalion of the Chinganyuchitui and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the Fengtien Army and a Cavalry detachment of the Kirin Army. The Third Tungpientao Subjugation operation, from November 22 to December 5, 1932, was launched to finally clear the remnants of Tang Juwu's guerrilla forces that had regrouped after the Second Tungpientao Subjugation campaign. The Manchukuo force was made up of a unit of Chinganyuchitui as well as locally raised militia forces from the Yalu, Central and Shenghai districts totaling 5,000 men. The operation was a success and led to the capture of 1,800 \\"bandits\\", some of whom were later recruited into the Manchukuo Army. On December 24, 1932, the Japanese 10th Division attacked guerrilla forces to the north of Mudanjiang River. January 5, 1933, General Kuan Chang-ching was forced to surrender his Volunteers at Suifehno on the Soviet frontier. On January 7, 1933, Japanese took over Mishan. On January 9, 1933, Li Du's guerrilla forces crossed Ussuri River into the USSR. By the end of February 1933, most of the large Volunteer Armies had dispersed into small guerrilla bands or had fled to the Soviet Union. === Aftermath === This was not the end of the Volunteer Armies. Some fought on as small guerrilla units, frequently called \\"shanlin\\". The bandit experiences of some of the commanders stood them in good stead for they were adept at surviving in the Manchurian winters and adapted to guerrilla warfare and they continued to harass the Japanese and Manchukuo forces for many years. The Japanese were forced to tie up considerable military forces and assets to continuously sweep the region with company-sized patrols for many months. Occasionally they organized larger operations. After a resurgence of activity the Japanese were forced to organize the large-scale Kirin Province Subjugation operation in October and November 1933. It involved 35,000 men of the Manchukuo Army in an attempt to clear the province of Kirin entirely of guerrillas. The Manchukuo force included the whole of the Kirin Army as well as the elements of the Heilungkiang Army, Hsingan Army and the Hsinching Independent Cavalry Detachment. The operation was deemed a success and led to the capture and death of a number of anti-Japanese commanders. Japanese troops during the Battle of Rehe Of the forces that fled Manchukuo, Feng Zhanhai and his men went on to serve against the Japanese Operation Nekka in Rehe and later with Feng Yuxiang's Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army in Chahar 1933. His forces were incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army as a division and fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Tang Juwu fought against the Japanese in Rehe, and was made head of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer 3rd Corps. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was assigned to operate behind the Japanese lines where he was killed on May 18, 1939. After his retreat to the Soviet Union, Su Bingwen served the Kuomintang government as a military board member and military inspection group director during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Out of favor with Chiang kai- Shek, it was not until after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that Ma Zhanshan was made commander of the Northeastern Advance Force in charge guerrilla operations in the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Kirin, Heilungkiang and Rehe. Ma led his troops to fight the Japanese in Chahar, Suiyuan, Datong and Shanxi areas and he cooperated with Fu-Zuyi's troops in the defense of Suiyuan. Ma was appointed as Chairman of the government of Heilongjiang in August 1940, and continued to hold that position to the end of the war. Of the Volunteer guerrilla leaders remaining in Manchukuo, Wang Fengge was captured in 1937 and executed, along with his wife and child. Wu Yicheng fought on with a small band of followers until 1937. Although Kong Xianrong, Wang Delin's deputy, gave up the struggle, his wife and another of Wang Delin's subordinates, Yao Zhenshan, led a small band which fought on until the spring of 1941 when it was annihilated. == Communists and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army 1934-1942 == === Early Conflict with the Anti Japanese Armies === After the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Chinese Communist Party organized a number of small anti-Japanese guerrilla units dedicated both to resistance against the Japanese and also to social revolution. However these units were far smaller than the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies which had been raised by based on patriotic appeal. When the first Volunteer Armies were organized, the Communist Party was initially completely hostile, mistrusting their motives and leadership. They also feared that the Volunteer Armies would give the Japanese a pretext for attacking the Soviet Union. The Communist Party in northeast China even issued an appeal for the volunteers to kill their officers and join the Communists in a social revolution. Despite Party disapproval, some Communist Party members joined or rendered assistance to the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies, and some rose to senior positions within the volunteer forces. They were particularly influential in Wang Delin's Chinese People's National Salvation Army (NSA), where Li Yanlu and Zhou Baozhong became high-ranking officers. At first the Party severely criticized their conduct. However, the Communists eventually had to face the fact that their current propaganda made them almost irrelevant to the anti- Japanese cause. The actions of Party members who joined or aided the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies eventually persuaded the international Communist movement to move towards a popular front policy in 1935. The Communist Party came to accept that whole-hearted support for the anti- Japanese movement and the postponement of revolutionary goals was essential if the Chinese Communists were to remain a serious political force. In 1934, after the defeat of the large Volunteer Armies, there were still various resistance forces with an estimated 50,000 men still in the field. All the Communist Party units were reorganized into the single Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, with Zhao Shangzhi as Commander-in-chief. The army was open to all who wanted to resist the Japanese and as it proclaimed its willingness to ally with all other anti-Japanese forces, this army won over some of the shanlin bands, including former NSA units. === United Front === In 1935, when the Party officially changed policy, and began creating a united front, the army welcomed and absorbed most of the remaining anti-Japanese forces in Manchuria and some Korean resistance fighters including Kim Il-sung. The number of insurgents in 1935 stood at about 40,000 men. The army was organized into Yang Jingyu's 1st Route Army (Fengtien Province), Zhou Baozhong's 2nd Route Army (Kirin Province), and Li Zhaolin's 3rd Route Army (Heilongjiang Province). The army's strategy was to form pockets of resistance in occupied areas, to harass the Japanese troops and undermine their attempts at administration, and when the Second Sino-Japanese War began in earnest in 1937, to make attacks to keep as many Japanese troops as possible from being sent into China. It conducted a protracted campaign which threatened the stability of the Manchukuo regime, especially during 1936 and 1937. The recently reformed Manchukuo Imperial Army replied with a major campaign with 16,000 men from October 1936 to March 1937, against the 1st Route Army in the Tungpientao region. This was the first time it operated against the guerrillas without the support of Japanese troops. Despite heavy casualties the Manchukuo Army managed to kill over two thousand guerrillas including some of their leaders. Thus, the number of insurgents declined to 30,000 in 1936; and 20,000 in 1937. An even larger and longer campaign from November 1937 to March 1939, was waged by 24,000 Manchukuo troops against the 2nd Route Army in the area between the Amur, Sungari and Ussuri Rivers. In the latter half of 1938, the Japanese Army concentrated troops in eastern Fengtien province, to encircle the remnants of Yang Jingyu's army, the most dangerous of the Anti-Japanese forces, with the most reliable base area. Although the Japanese managed to cut off the supply lines to the guerrillas, they persevered, frequently launching attacks that compelled the Japanese and Manchukuoans to divert forces into punitive expeditions against them. As of September 1938, the number of insurgents had dwindled to an estimated 10,000 combatants as a result of years of fighting and privation. The Kwantung Army then brought reinforcements with a plan to mop up the remaining anti-Japanese forces in Fengtien. This operation gradually produced a critical lack of supplies, and from January to mid-February 1940 Yang Jingyu led the struggle until he died on February 23, 1940 trying to break out of the encirclement when an officer betrayed his detachment. With its strongest armies dispersed or destroyed and its base areas pacified, the remnant resistance fighters, including Kim Il-sung, were gradually forced to retreat into Siberia between 1940 and 1942. In November 1941, Li Zhaolin entered the Soviet Union. By July 1942 Zhou Baozhong followed. Finally on February 12, 1942, Zhao Shangzhi was captured by Japanese military police after being attacked by one of their agents, and later died. ==Footnotes== == Sources == * Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) 2nd Ed., 1971.
