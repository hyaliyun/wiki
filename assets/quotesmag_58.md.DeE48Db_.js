He helped to build trade relationships between the United States and Japan, especially in the silk industry.  Early life and education  Arai was born Ryosuke Hoshino on August 31, 1855 in what is now Kiryu, Gunma. He was adopted by the Arai family, and his given name was changed to Ryoichiro. His older brother, Chotaro Hoshino, had a silk production business. Arai studied English and accounting at several schools in Tokyo. After graduation, Chotaro encouraged Arai to go to the United States so that Arai could help his business.  Career  In March 1876, Yukichi Fukuzawa advised Arai and five other men to go to New York City to promote trade. While living there, Arai studied English at the Plymouth Institute in Brooklyn Heights. Later that year, Arai made a deal to sell B. Richardson and Sons, a silk importer, 400 pounds of raw silk from Chotaro's company for $6.50 per pound. However, that was far under the market value for silk in Japan at the time. Chotaro's company lost $2,000 after Arai refused to renegotiate the contract with Richardson. He didn't want to renegotiate so that he could keep Richardson's trust, because Japanese silk merchants had a bad reputation at the time. Richardson gave them a bonus when the silk arrived. This was the first direct shipment of Japanese silk to the United States. In 1878, Arai and Momotaro Sato, one of the other men Fukuzawa sent, started the Sato Arai Company. Arai also worked as the Doshin Kaisha's New York representative from 1880 onward. The Sato Arai Company dissolved when Sato returned to Japan in 1881. However, the company was successful enough that Arai was able to return to Japan and marry Tazu Ushiba. They returned to New York, then moved to Riverside, Connecticut in 1893. They had two children. Arai resigned from the Doshin Kaisha and temporarily returned to Japan in 1893. While there, he started two companies: the Yokohama Kiito Gomei Kaisha, a silk exporter, and the Morimura Arai Company, which handled the former's direct sales in the United States. The latter was a partnership with Ichizaemon Morimura. By 1908, the Morimura Arai Company handled 30% of all silk exports to the United States and cotton imports from the United States to Japan. Arai was elected to the board of governors for the Silk Association of America in 1901, and was the first Asian to hold that position. He also helped to found Japanese community organizations in New York, like the Nippon Club in 1905 and the Japan Society of New York in 1907. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1928. Arai died in Connecticut on April 10, 1939. Haru Reischauer and Tane Matsukata are his granddaughters.

The name Yakou literally means \\"mountain pass\\". At the peak, there is a short, one-way named the Daguanshan Tunnel, which is the highest tunnel in Taiwan. Administratively, it is located at the border of Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Haiduan, Taitung. Yakou is known its frequent sea of clouds on the east side due to orographic lift from the Pacific Ocean. However, due to severe road collapses following Typhoon Morakot in 2009, Yakou is currently inaccessible by car. Occasionally, the character \\"啞\\" (yǎ) is used in place of 埡 since the latter is a rarely used character.  History  Initially, a path made by the Bunun people ran through Yakou. During Japan's occupation of Taiwan, the path was widened to better govern the aboriginal population in the mountains. After Japan left the island, the path was widened into the Southern Cross-Island Highway. Construction ran between 1968 and 1972, and construction workers established a campsite near Yakou; the site of the campsite became a hostel operated by the China Youth Corps. After Typhoon Morakot in 2009, multiple sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway collapsed from the heavy rainfall. Immediately east of Yakou, a landslide buried Daguanshan Tunnel's east entrance and its adjacent parking lot and destroyed 300 m of highway. Though not as heavily affected, the hostel closed down after the typhoon. The section of the highway from Meishan to the west and Xiangyang to the east was closed to outside traffic after the typhoon and remains closed to this day. The highway is expected to reopen in 2021.  Geology  The rock around Yakou is primarily composed of a stratum composed of argillite, another of shale, and a third of slate and phyllite. Due to the parallel planes of weakness present in the rocks, Yakou and the rest of the Southern Cross-Island Highway is very prone to landslides and failures even before Typhoon Morakot in 2009, and reconstruction has proven to be very difficult.

For a given instance of the stable matching problem, this lattice provides an algebraic description of the family of all solutions to the problem. It was originally described in the 1970s by John Horton Conway and Donald Knuth. By Birkhoff's representation theorem, this lattice can be represented as the lower sets of an underlying partially ordered set, and the elements of this set can be given a concrete structure as rotations, cycle graphs describing the changes between adjacent stable matchings in the lattice. The family of all rotations and their partial order can be constructed in polynomial time, leading to polynomial time for other problems on stable matching including the minimum or maximum weight stable matching. The Gale–Shapley algorithm can be used to construct two special lattice elements, its top and bottom element. Every finite distributive lattice can be represented as a lattice of stable matchings. The number of elements in the lattice can vary from an average case of e^{-1}n\\\\ln n to a worst-case of exponential. Computing the number of elements is #P-complete. Background In its simplest form, an instance of the stable matching problem consists of two sets of the same number of elements to be matched to each other, for instance doctors and positions at hospitals. Each element has a preference ordering on the elements of the other type: the doctors each have different preferences for which hospital they would like to work at (for instance based on which cities they would prefer to live in), and the hospitals each have preferences for which doctors they would like to work for them (for instance based on specialization or recommendations). The goal is to find a matching that is stable: no pair of a doctor and a hospital prefer each other to their assigned match. Versions of this problem are used, for instance, by the National Resident Matching Program to match American medical students to hospitals. In general, there may be many different stable matchings. For example, suppose there are three doctors (A,B,C) and three hospitals (X,Y,Z) which have preferences of: :A: YXZ B: ZYX C: XZY :X: BAC Y: CBA Z: ACB There are three stable solutions to this matching arrangement: # The doctors get their first choice and the hospitals get their third: AY, BZ, CX. # All participants get their second choice: AX, BY, CZ. # The hospitals get their first choice and the doctors their third: AZ, BX, CY. The lattice of stable matchings organizes this collection of solutions, for any instance of stable matching, giving it the structure of a distributive lattice. Structure Partial order on matchings The lattice of stable matchings is based on the following weaker structure, a partially ordered set whose elements are the stable matchings. Define a comparison operation \\\\le on the stable matchings, where P\\\\le Q if and only if all doctors prefer matching Q to matching P: either they have the same assigned hospital in both matchings, or they are assigned a better hospital in Q than they are in P. If the doctors disagree on which matching they prefer, then P and Q are incomparable: neither one is \\\\le the other. The same comparison operation can be defined in the same way for any two sets of elements, not just doctors and hospitals. The choice of which of the two sets of elements to use in the role of the doctors is arbitrary. Swapping the roles of the doctors and hospitals reverses the ordering of every pair of elements, but does not otherwise change the structure of the partial order. Then this ordering gives the matchings the structure of a partially ordered set. To do so, it must obey the following three properties: *For every matching P, P\\\\le P *For every two different matchings P and Q, it cannot be the case that both P\\\\le Q and Q\\\\le P are true. *For every three different matchings P, Q, and R, if P\\\\le Q and Q\\\\le R, then P\\\\le R. For stable matchings, all three properties follow directly from the definition of the comparison operation. Top and bottom elements Define the best match of an element x of a stable matching instance to be the element y that x most prefers, among all the elements that can be matched to x in a stable matching, and define the worst match analogously. Then no two elements can have the same best match. For, suppose to the contrary that doctors x and x' both have y as their best match, and that y prefers x to x'. Then, in the stable matching that matches x' to y (which must exist by the definition of the best match of x'), x and y would be an unstable pair, because y prefers x to x' and x prefers y to any other partner in any stable matching. This contradiction shows that assigning all doctors to their best matches gives a matching. It is a stable matching, because any unstable pair would also be unstable for one of the matchings used to define best matches. As well as assigning all doctor to their best matches, it assigns all hospitals to their worst matches. In the partial ordering on the matchings, it is greater than all other stable matchings. Symmetrically, assigning all doctors to their worst matches and assigning all hospitals to their best matches gives another stable matching. In the partial order on the matchings, it is less than all other stable matchings. The Gale–Shapley algorithm gives a process for constructing stable matchings, that can be described as follows: until a matching is reached, the algorithm chooses an arbitrary hospital with an unfilled position, and that hospital makes a job offer to the doctor it most prefers among the ones it has not already made offers to. If the doctor is unemployed or has a less-preferred assignment, the doctor accepts the offer (and resigns from their other assignment if it exists). The process always terminates, because each doctor and hospital interact only once. When it terminates, the result is a stable matching, the one that assigns each hospital to its best match and that assigns all doctors to their worst matches. An algorithm that swaps the roles of the doctors and hospitals (in which unemployed doctors send a job applications to their next preference among the hospitals, and hospitals accept applications either when they have an unfilled position or they prefer the new applicant, firing the doctor they had previously accepted) instead produces the stable matching that assigns all doctors to their best matches and each hospital to its worst match. Lattice operations Given any two stable matchings P and Q for the same input, one can form two more matchings P\\\\vee Q and P\\\\wedge Q in the following way: :In P\\\\vee Q, each doctor gets their best choice among the two hospitals they are matched to in P and Q (if these differ) and each hospital gets its worst choice. :In P\\\\wedge Q, each doctor gets their worst choice among the two hospitals they are matched to in P and Q (if these differ) and each hospital gets its best choice. (The same operations can be defined in the same way for any two sets of elements, not just doctors and hospitals.) Then both P\\\\vee Q and P\\\\wedge Q are matchings. It is not possible, for instance, for two doctors to have the same best choice and be matched to the same hospital in P\\\\vee Q, for regardless of which of the two doctors is preferred by the hospital, that doctor and hospital would form an unstable pair in whichever of P and Q they are not already matched in. Because the doctors are matched in P\\\\vee Q, the hospitals must also be matched. The same reasoning applies symmetrically to P\\\\wedge Q. Additionally, both P\\\\vee Q and P\\\\wedge Q are stable. There cannot be a pair of a doctor and hospital who prefer each other to their match, because the same pair would necessarily also be an unstable pair for at least one of P and Q. Lattice properties The two operations P\\\\vee Q and P\\\\wedge Q form the join and meet operations of a finite distributive lattice. In this context, a finite lattice is defined as a partially ordered finite set in which there is a unique minimum element and a unique maximum element, in which every two elements have a unique least element greater than or equal to both of them (their join) and every two elements have a unique greatest element less than or equal to both of them (their meet). In the case of the operations P\\\\vee Q and P\\\\wedge Q defined above, the join P\\\\vee Q is greater than or equal to both P and Q because it was defined to give each doctor their preferred choice, and because these preferences of the doctors are how the ordering on matchings is defined. It is below any other matching that is also above both P and Q, because any such matching would have to give each doctor an assigned match that is at least as good. Therefore, it fits the requirements for the join operation of a lattice. Symmetrically, the operation P\\\\wedge Q fits the requirements for the meet operation. Because they are defined using an element-wise minimum or element- wise maximum in the preference ordering, these two operations obey the same distributive laws obeyed by the minimum and maximum operations on linear orderings: for every three different matchings P, Q, and R, :P\\\\wedge(Q\\\\vee R)=(P\\\\wedge Q)\\\\vee (P\\\\wedge R) and :P\\\\vee(Q\\\\wedge R)=(P\\\\vee Q)\\\\wedge (P\\\\vee R) Therefore, the lattice of stable matchings is a distributive lattice. Representation by rotations Birkhoff's representation theorem states that any finite distributive lattice can be represented by a family of finite sets, with intersection and union as the meet and join operations, and with the relation of being a subset as the comparison operation for the associated partial order. More specifically, these sets can be taken to be the lower sets of an associated partial order. In the general form of Birkhoff's theorem, this partial order can be taken as the induced order on a subset of the elements of the lattice, the join-irreducible elements (elements that cannot be formed as joins of two other elements). For the lattice of stable matchings, the elements of the partial order can instead be described in terms of structures called rotations, described by . Suppose that two different stable matchings P and Q are comparable and have no third stable matching between them in the partial order. (That is, P and Q form a pair of the covering relation of the partial order of stable matchings.) Then the set of pairs of elements that are matched in one but not both of P and Q (the symmetric difference of their sets of matched pairs) is called a rotation. It forms a cycle graph whose edges alternate between the two matchings. Equivalently, the rotation can be described as the set of changes that would need to be performed to change the lower of the two matchings into the higher one (with lower and higher determined using the partial order). If two different stable matchings are separately the higher matching for the same rotation, then so is their meet. It follows that for any rotation, the set of stable matchings that can be the higher of a pair connected by the rotation has a unique lowest element. This lowest matching is join irreducible, and this gives a one-to-one correspondence between rotations and join-irreducible stable matchings. If the rotations are given the same partial ordering as their corresponding join-irreducible stable matchings, then Birkhoff's representation theorem gives a one-to-one correspondence between lower sets of rotations and all stable matchings. The set of rotations associated with any given stable matching can be obtained by changing the given matching by rotations downward in the partial ordering, choosing arbitrarily which rotation to perform at each step, until reaching the bottom element, and listing the rotations used in this sequence of changes. The stable matching associated with any lower set of rotations can be obtained by applying the rotations to the bottom element of the lattice of stable matchings, choosing arbitrarily which rotation to apply when more than one can apply. Every pair (x,y) of elements of a given stable matching instance belongs to at most two rotations: one rotation that, when applied to the lower of two matchings, removes other assignments to x and y and instead assigns them to each other, and a second rotation that, when applied to the lower of two matchings, removes pair (x,y) from the matching and finds other assignments for those two elements. Because there are n^2 pairs of elements, there are O(n^2) rotations. Mathematical properties Universality Beyond being a finite distributive lattice, there are no other constraints on the lattice structure of stable matchings. This is because, for every finite distributive lattice L, there exists a stable matching instance whose lattice of stable matchings is isomorphic to L. More strongly, if a finite distributive lattice has k elements, then it can be realized using a stable matching instance with at most k^2-k+4 doctors and hospitals. Number of lattice elements The lattice of stable matchings can be used to study the computational complexity of counting the number of stable matchings of a given instance. From the equivalence between lattices of stable matchings and arbitrary finite distributive lattices, it follows that this problem has equivalent computational complexity to counting the number of elements in an arbitrary finite distributive lattice, or to counting the antichains in an arbitrary partially ordered set. Computing the number of stable matchings is #P-complete. In a uniformly-random instance of the stable marriage problem with n doctors and n hospitals, the average number of stable matchings is asymptotically e^{-1}n\\\\ln n. In a stable marriage instance chosen to maximize the number of different stable matchings, this number can be at least 2^{n-1}, and us also upper-bounded by an exponential function of (significantly smaller than the naive factorial bound on the number of matchings). Algorithmic consequences The family of rotations and their partial ordering can be constructed in polynomial time from a given instance of stable matching, and provides a concise representation to the family of all stable matchings, which can for some instances be exponentially larger when listed explicitly. This allows several other computations on stable matching instances to be performed efficiently. Weighted stable matching and closure If each pair of elements in a stable matching instance is assigned a real-valued weight, it is possible to find the minimum or maximum weight stable matching in polynomial time. One possible method for this is to apply linear programming to the order polytope of the partial order of rotations, or to the stable matching polytope. An alternative, combinatorial algorithm is possible, based on the same partial order. From the weights on pairs of elements, one can assign weights to each rotation, where a rotation that changes a given stable matching to another one higher in the partial ordering of stable matchings is assigned the change in weight that it causes: the total weight of the higher matching minus the total weight of the lower matching. By the correspondence between stable matchings and lower sets of rotations, the total weight of any matching is then equal to the total weight of its corresponding lower set, plus the weight of the bottom element of the lattice of matchings. The problem of finding the minimum or maximum weight stable matching becomes in this way equivalent to the problem of finding the minimum or maximum weight lower set in a partially ordered set of polynomial size, the partially ordered set of rotations. This optimal lower set problem is equivalent to an instance of the closure problem, a problem on vertex-weighted directed graphs in which the goal is to find a subset of vertices of optimal weight with no outgoing edges. The optimal lower set is an optimal closure of a directed acyclic graph that has the elements of the partial order as its vertices, with an edge from \\\\alpha to \\\\beta whenever \\\\alpha\\\\le\\\\beta in the partial order. The closure problem can, in turn, be solved in polynomial time by transforming it into an instance of the maximum flow problem. Minimum regret defines the regret of a participant in a stable matching to be the distance of their assigned match from the top of their preference list. He defines the regret of a stable matching to be the maximum regret of any participant. Then one can find the minimum-regret stable matching by a simple greedy algorithm that starts at the bottom element of the lattice of matching and then repeatedly applies any rotation that reduces the regret of a participant with maximum regret, until this would cause some other participant to have greater regret. Median stable matching The elements of any distributive lattice form a median graph, a structure in which any three elements P, Q, and R (here, stable matchings) have a unique median element m(P,Q,R) that lies on a shortest path between any two of them. It can be defined as: :m(P,Q,R)=(P\\\\wedge Q)\\\\vee(P\\\\wedge R)\\\\vee(Q\\\\wedge R)=(P\\\\vee Q)\\\\wedge(P\\\\vee R)\\\\wedge(Q\\\\vee R). For the lattice of stable matchings, this median can instead be taken element- wise, by assigning each doctor the median in the doctor's preferences of the three hospitals matched to that doctor in P, Q, and R and similarly by assigning each hospital the median of the three doctors matched to it. More generally, any set of an odd number of elements of any distributive lattice (or median graph) has a median, a unique element minimizing its sum of distances to the given set. For the median of an odd number of stable matchings, each participant is matched to the median element of the multiset of their matches from the given matchings. For an even set of stable matchings, this can be disambiguated by choosing the assignment that matches each doctor to the higher of the two median elements, and each hospital to the lower of the two median elements. In particular, this leads to a definition for the median matching in the set of all stable matchings. However, for some instances of the stable matching problem, finding this median of all stable matchings is NP-hard.

History  The Beanie Festival was started in 1997, on a much smaller scale, with a 'beanie party' designed to create a unique social-enterprise and it was the idea of Adi Dunlop. The festival was inspired by the cold desert winters and existing popularity of beanies with Central Australian Aboriginal people who were already creating colourful and individual hand made creations. Beanies were often decorated with seeds, various fibres and other embellishments. Beanies were also picked as a perfect social-enterprise as they are ideal for the tourist market, being light and inexpensive.

Since 2008, he has been Chief Executive Officer of BMG Rights Management, a Bertelsmann group division. Under his leadership, BMG became a leading international music company. According to Billboard, he is among the most influential representatives of the industry in the world. Masuch was himself a musician and producer and is considered a pioneer of the Neue Deutsche Welle.  Early life  After graduating high school, Masuch began studying economics at the Ruhr University Bochum in 1974. At the same time, he worked for the Chair of Money Theory, and was the frontman of the punk and new wave band The Ramblers. To finance his livelihood, he worked as a taxi driver at times. At the age of 20, Masuch signed his first recording contract. In 1980, he finished his studies without graduation to concentrate on his career as a musician. Masuch founded an independent music publishing house, was the frist to sign with Nena and produced the debut album of Extrabreit. Since then, he has been regarded as a pioneer of Neue Deutsche Welle. He also established his own music label and was responsible for hits by Ina Deter and others before selling it in 1984.  Career  In 1985 Masuch joined Warner Music Publishing as general manager repertoire. After two years he was promoted to the position of general manager and vice president creative affairs. During this time he signed nationally and internationally successful bands. In 1991, Masuch joined BMG Music Publishing, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, as managing director and senior vice president. There he was mainly responsible for business in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Masuch left the company in 2007 to sell BMG Music Publishing to Universal Music, where he advised Bertelsmann on the separation from Sony BMG and the reorganization of activities in the music industry. Masuch coordinated the administration and marketing of the music rights to works by around 200 European artists, such as the Prinzen, that remained with the group. The catalog formed the cornerstone for the foundation of BMG Rights Management in 2008. Masuch was managing it from the beginning, and positioned the company as a fair and service-oriented partner for artists. He also focused on digital marketing, especially on streaming services. With the support of Thomas Rabe, Chief Executive Officer of Bertelsmann, Masuch organized the temporary participation of the financial investor KKR. From 2009 to 2013, KKR supported the international expansion and numerous acquisitions of BMG Rights Management. Since 2013, Masuch has been a member of Bertelsmann's Group Management Committee, the highest management body below the Executive Board.  Criticism  The 2018 Echo Music Prize was overshadowed by a controversy over supposedly anti-semitic texts by Kollegah and Farid Bang. Masuch also had to explain himself for the release of the album by BMG Rights Management. He emphasized the principle of artistic freedom, which the company takes very seriously. BMG Rights Management stopped working with both rappers, and initiated a campaign against anti-semitism.

The structure is indicated by number 75. The location of the former Steen Castle on the Burg Square. Het Steen was a medieval building on the Burg square in the Belgian town of Bruges. Between the late 11th and late 13th centuries it served as the residence of the Counts of Flanders.Brigitte Beernaert, 'Het Steen. Een benadering van de vroegere Brugse gevangenis', in Van middeleeuwen tot heden. Bladeren door Brugse kunst en geschiedenis, Brugge, 1983.  History  It is not clear whether the building was a successor to the Oude Steen, which is on Wollestraat – in the oldest part of the city – and which has cornerstones dating back to the 11th or 12th century. Steen Castle may also date from that period, but little is known about its early history. It is likely that it was built to replace a wooden structure. According to historians, the first stone building - a keep - was built between 863 and 965 by Count Baldwin I, Count Baldwin II or Count Arnulf I. Another historian has dated the building to the reign of Count Baldwin V (1035 – 1067). The first definite date that can be given to the building is 1088, when the building was listed as ‘lapidis domus comitis’. Galbert of Bruges’ story about the murder of Charles the Good also mentions Steen Castle as the residence of the Count. It is said that one of his successors abandoned the building in the 12th century and chose stay in the Love on the opposite side of Burg square when he was visiting Bruges. From the end of the 12th century, Steen Castle was used as a Count's prison. At the end of the 13th century, the Count also left the Love and granted the city the right to use a number of buildings around Bruges which he owned. Steen Castle became the city prison. In 1689, the building was largely destroyed by a fire and the Raephuis on the Pandreitje was established as the new prison. In 1751, the city acquired full ownership of Steen Castle. It was still badly damaged by the fire and the city took the decision to demolish the dilapidated building in 1784–85. The plot remained undeveloped until the middle of the 19th century, when the city sold the land and a building and workshop was established there by the ironmonger Joseph De Jaegher. This building was demolished in 1955 and replaced by a neoclassical building with three floors and four bays. In 1977, this building was also demolished, to be replaced by a building with a shopping gallery – Ten Steeghere – which led to Wollestraat. Next to this, there was a 19th-century neo-Gothic commercial building which still remains in place. This building, which was known as In de Kapelle, was rebuilt in 1931, adding three stepped gables in the neo-Gothic style. Nowadays the building houses Brasserie Tompouce.

He is the CEO of Kwacha Group of Companies, a privately held family office with interests in various sectors of the Kenyan economy including agri-business, financial services, industrials and real estate. He is however best known for being the key political strategist for Raila Odinga's 2017 election campaigns and the quiet force behind Uhuru Kenyatta's 2013 election victory. Early life and education Wanjigi grew up around politics. His father, Maina Wanjigi served as a Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister in Kenya's first two cabinets. Career Business He is the CEO of Kwacha Group of Companies, a privately held family office with interests in various sectors of the Kenyan economy including agri-business, financial services, industrials and real estate. Political history Jimi Wanjigi's dalliance with politics started in 1992 during Kenya's first multi- party elections, where at a relatively young age, he got involved in Kenneth Matiba's election campaign. Wanjigi remained actively in politics behind the scenes during the years to come. He maintained a close friendship with the former vice president of Kenya George Saitoti until his death in June 2012. Following the death of Professor Saitoti in 2012, Jimmy moved his support to Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto for the presidency during the 2013 Kenyan general election.He played a pivotal role in brokering the alliance between Ruto's United Republican Party (Kenya) and Kenyatta's The National Alliance in 2012, leading to a joint ticket under what is now the Jubilee Party. He reportedly brokered the peace between Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta in the aftermath of the 2013 Kenyan general election. In 2017, he shifted his political support to Raila Odinga, causing a public fall out between Wanjigi and President Uhuru Kenyatta. This led to severe backlash against Wanjigi from the state including a travel blockade, a dramatic 3 day assault by the Kenyan police on his Muthaiga home and politically motivated charges being brought against him and his octogenarian father. The charges were eventually thrown out by the courts. In February 2018, a fake obituary of Wanjigi ran in the Daily Nation, in what was viewed as a politically motivated death threat. He sued the media house and was awarded Shs. 8million in damages.  Personal life  Jimi is a son to former Kamukunji MP, and Cabinet Minister Maina Wanjigi. He's an alumnus of St. Mary's School, Nairobi where his schoolmates included Uhuru Kenyatta and Gideon Moi After leaving school he matriculated at York University where he studied business from 1982 - 1986.

Henry I of Brabant  Henry I of Brabant was the count of Leuven in the period that the city was still one of the most important cities. In 1183 he became duke of Brabant and later duke of Lower Lorraine. In the Saint Peter's church of Leuven you can find his grave, together with that of his wife Mathilda van Boulogne and his daughter Maria of Brabant. In 1235 the duke was commissioned by the German emperor Henry II of Hohenstaufen to accompany the imperial fiancée Isabella Plantagenet from England to Germany. However, he died en route in Cologne, before he could complete his assignment.  The Tomb  The tomb is the oldest surviving of its kind. The image of Henry I has been idealized in the relief: he is depicted as a smiling young man. In addition, he lies on a high base, wears a long robe and the duke's cloak, and holds a scepter; his left hand plays with the cord of the mantle. The archangels Raphaël and Michael wave the censer at his head. In addition to the tomb of Hendrik I van Brabant, there are also the tombs of his wife Mathilde van Boulogne and his daughter Maria van Brabant.  Location  Originally, the tomb was at the altar. This was a privilege reserved only for prominent families and high clergy. The initially Romanesque church was replaced by a Gothic church in the fifteenth century. It was then that Hendrik's grave was moved and given a place of honor in front of the high altar. During the French occupation in the eighteenth century, the grave was destroyed and its remains were buried under the tower. Only in the mid-nineteenth century was the burial monument restored and placed in the chapel of Saint John of Latheran. The bones of Hendrik I were dug up in 1929 and only a few decades later, namely in 1998, were they put back in the tomb. In the meantime, the monument has been relocated and is back in its original place: in front of the high altar.'Grafmonument van hertog Hendrik I', Erfgoedplus.be (https://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/24062A51.priref.17497) Category:Tombs ","title":"Tomb of Duke Henry I"},{"id":"62427467","text":"Anti-social Media Bill was introduced by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 5 November 2019 to criminalise the use of the social media in peddling false or malicious information. The original title of the bill is Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill 2019. It was sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from the largely conservative northern Nigeria with 85 per cent illiteracy with low internet penetration and social media activities. After the bill passed second reading on the floor of the Nigeria Senate and its details were made public, information emerged on the social media accusing the sponsor of the bill of plagiarising a similar law in Singapore which is at the bottom of global ranking in the freedom of speech and of the press. But the senator denied that he plagiarised Singaporean law.  Opposition to the bill  Angry reactions trailed the introduction of the bill, and a number of civil society organisations, human rights activists, and Nigerian citizens unanimously opposed the bill. International rights group, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the proposed legislation saying it is aimed at gagging freedom of speech which is a universal right in a country of over two hundred million people. Opposition political parties are very critical of the bill and accused the government of attempting to strip bare, Nigerian citizens of their rights to free speech and destroying same social media on whose power and influence the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC came to power in 2015. Nigeria Information Minister, Lai Mohammed has been at the center of public criticism because he is suspected to be the brain behind the proposed act. Lai a former spokesman of then opposition All Progressives Congress is a well-known propagandist who thrived on peddling falsehood as a political weapon against then ruling People's Democratic Party, PDP that lost power to the APC in 2015 A \\"Stop the Social Media Bill! You can no longer take our rights from us\\" online petition campaign to force the Nigeria parliament to drop the bill received over 90,000 signatures within 24 hours. In November 2019, after the bill passed second reading in the senate, Akon Eyakenyi, a senator from Akwa Ibom State publicly said he would resist the bill.  Support for the bill  Those who support the proposed act especially Senators have often argued that the law would help curtail hate speech. President Muhammad Buhari who is seen as the biggest beneficiary of the influence and power of the social media and free speech that is now termed hate speech has been mute about it. But the president's senior aides and family members have publicly spoken in support of the bill. In November 2019, the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, told a gathering at the Nigeria's National Mosque in the capital, Abuja that if China with over one billion people could regulate the social media, Nigeria should do same. But Nigerians reacted saying Nigeria is not a one-party communist state like China. Days later, a daughter to the president, Zahra Indimi told a gathering of young people in Abuja that social media had become a potent weapon for bullying those they thought were doing better than them in terms of social class and called for a critical regulation.

In 1982, the company moved its headquarters from New York and São Paulo to Lugano. Initially active only in the steel trade, Duferco also expanded its activities to the commodities trade in the early 1990s, in particular with raw materials for the steel industry such as coke, coal, iron ore, pig iron or sponge iron. With the acquisition in 1996 of the Italian Ferdofin Siderurgica (later renamed Duferdofin) Duferco rose in the steel production. Later, the company acquired additional steel mills, especially in Italy, Belgium and Eastern Europe.

Together with Albrecht Bouts, the son of Dirk Bouts, he managed the clerk chapel. In addition, from 1519 until his death in 1535, he continuously held the position of dean in the city council.'Jan (I) Rombouts - De opstanding van een zestiende-eeuwse schilder', OKV, http://www.tento.be/nl/OKV-artikel/jan-i- rombouts-de-opstanding-van-een-zestiende-eeuwse-schilder) Two of his works have been preserved in the Saint Peter's Church in Leuven, namely The Martyrdom of St. Clement and The Martyrdom of St. Catherine. __TOC__  The Martyrdom of St. Catherine  This double-sided painted panel, with representations from the life of Saint Catherine on the inside and a cross in grisaille on the outside, was made between 1525 and 1535. Originally these panels were side panels of an altarpiece, the central part of which was lost. Around the nineteenth century the grisaille scenes were covered with a red layer of paint. During the restoration, that layer was removed and various fragments of the grisailles were visible again. 'The Martyrdom of St. Catherine of Alexandria' is part of an altarpiece together with 'The Martyrdom of Pope Clement Romanus'. This would have been the left side hatch. The front tells the story of the martyrdom of Catharina. This story is based on the Legenda Aurea. Catharina refused to marry the pagan emperor Maxentius, since she was already engaged in mystical way to Christ. Maxentius subsequently sentenced her to death by torture. The torture gear was destroyed by lightning descending from heaven, nevertheless Catharina died as a martyr by decapitation. Catharina kneels down praying in the foreground of the painting, waiting for the final blow. The destruction of the torture gear is depicted in the background. At the far left her angels carry her body to Mount Sinai.'De marteling van de heilige Catharina van Alexandrië', Erfgoedplus (https://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/24062A51.priref.16948)  The Martyrdom of St. Clement  This work was also made between 1525 and 1535 and represents the right-hand side panel of the altarpiece. The inside tells several scenes from the life of Saint Clement. These scenes were rarely depicted in paintings, but were described in the Legenda Aurea. Clement Romanus was Peter's third successor and was the pope from 92 to 101 AD. He has converted many people, including Theodora, the wife of the pagan Sisinnius. Legend has it that Sisinnius secretly followed his wife to the church where Clemens preached. When he entered the building, he immediately lost his eyesight and hearing. Theodora asked Clemens to help her husband and healed the man through prayer. He had Clemens arrested immediately for sorcery, this is shown centrally; Clemens is arrested, Sisinnius furiously raises his sword and Theodora tries to calm down her husband. Legend has it that after Clement's arrest, Saint Peter appeared to Theodora - this can be seen in the background on the left. On the right-hand side of the panel you can see how Clement was exiled a few years later by Emperor Trajan to an island in the Pontus, where many Christians were employed in the marble quarries. It is on that island that Clemens was thrown into the sea with an anchor around Trajan's command.'De marteling van paus Clemens Romanus I', Erfgoedplus (https://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/24062A51.priref.16949) References Category:Belgian art ","title":"Jan Rombouts in the St. Peter's Church"},{"id":"62427590","text":"Gaspare Cataldo (1902–1970) was an Italian screenwriter.

He's the leader of the apes in both the original and reboot series. Caesar is portrayed by Roddy McDowall in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Later on Andy Serkis portrays the character in the reboot series consisting of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and War for the Planet of the Apes. Caesar is an evolved chimpanzee who is the leader of the Ape Army, the king of the Ape Colony, and the patriarch of the Royal Ape Family. In the original series, Caesar is the biological son of Cornelius and Zira, the husband of Lisa, and the father of Cornelius II. In the rebooted series, he's the son of Alpha and Bright Eyes, the adoptive son of Will Rodman and Caroline Aranha. and the father of Blue Eyes and Cornelius. Caesar is raised by Will and Caroline after the death of his mother, but is forced to live in captivity after he violently attacks a neighbor. Caesar later leads his fellow apes in a rebellion against abusive handlers and the police by unleashing the deadly ALZ-113 virus, which is dangerous to the human population, but not to the apes. Caesar maintains dominance over his community of intelligent apes while also having to deal with the threat of war against human survivors, who had been pushed to near-extinction due to a pandemic known as the Simian Flu. Background Original series Born as \\"Milo\\", named after his parents' friend Dr. Milo, Caesar first appeared in Escape from the Planet of the Apes as the son of talking chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira after they travelled back in time to the Earth of Taylor's era. As the infant was feared to be the cause of the future where his parents originated, Milo was raised by circus owner Armando after Zira switched him with a young chimpanzee recently born to Armando's primitive chimpanzee, Heloise, prior to his parents' death by the action of the human Dr. Otto Hasslein. As Hasslein killed the infant with Zira deposing of the body, Milo was assumed dead and was raised by Armando as a mute acrobat who was renamed \\"Caesar\\". In Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, two decades after the events in Escape, a now-adult Caesar and Armando maintain a charade by having Armando keep him on a chain as a pet, while Armando secretly educates Caesar on the events that led to the apes' state of slavery. Caesar is taken to a city for the first time and sees groups of apes being dispersed, chimps and orangutans being scolded or punished for honest mistakes or for exhibiting apelike behavior. Upon seeing the barbaric treatments of his fellow apes, he impulsively cries out, \\"Lousy human bastards!\\" Armando attempts to convince the police that he was the one who spoke, but Caesar panics and runs away in the commotion with Armando deciding to have him join an arrival shipment of apes while he attempts to bluff his way out of trouble. Passing his conditioning with flying colors, Caesar is held at an auction and is sold to Governor Breck and supervised by his assistant Mr. MacDonald. When Breck brings out a reference book as a means to formally name him, Caesar chooses his adopted name under the guise of a random picking and is assigned to the city's \\"Ape Management\\" command post and its lockup for disobedient apes. He is also selected to mate with Lisa at that time. When Caesar learns that Armando died while in custody, he plots an ape revolt and convinces the other apes to join him. But Caesar is belatedly traced, where he soon gets captured and then gets interrogated and tortured by Breck, who forces him to expose his identity as the offspring of Cornelius and Zira. When Breck is about to execute Caesar, MacDonald excuses himself from the scene and turns off the breaker settings for the electroshock table, where Caesar pretends to be dead before he kills the handler and begins the revolt. Within hours, the city is in flames, the police and military have been beaten down, and the apes are now in control. Caesar predicts that word will spread of his revolution and the same thing will soon happen around the world. Despite MacDonald's pleas to prevent further violence, Caesar declares that humanity will destroy itself and the apes will become the masters of the world, only to cease when Lisa musters the ability to speak, convincing Caesar not to condemn all of humanity. In Battle for the Planet of the Apes, 29 years after Caesar led the revolt in Conquest and 12 years after the world got destroyed by a nuclear war, Caesar took his apes and the remaining captive humans and they started a new civilization together. Even though apes and humans are coexisting in peace, a gorilla named Aldo is the only one who opposes Caesar and despises the humans. Wanting to know about his parents, Caesar travels to the ruined city to find the archives about his parents, where he's accompanied by MacDonald, the younger brother of the late MacDonald from Conquest and his ape advisor Virgil. After learning who they are and about the eventual destruction of Earth, Caesar manages to escape the city when he, MacDonald and Virgil get attacked by a group of mutated, radiation- scarred humans led by Governor Kolp who have survived and are living in the city. Meanwhile, Aldo plots to overthrow Caesar and have the gorillas take control of the ape-human village, where Caesar's son Cornelius eavesdrops on Aldo, who kills the young ape in the process. Taking advantage of Caesar's grief and absence, Aldo has all the humans in the village imprisoned and raids the armory to prepare for battle against the mutated humans and to overthrow Caesar. When Kolp and the mutated humans launch an attack on the village, Caesar and the apes manage to defeat and capture most of them, where Kolp and his remaining forces try to escape but they get killed by Aldo and his troops. Caesar tries to defend the imprisoned humans when Aldo tries to kill the rest of the humans and threatens Caesar. When Virgil reveals that Aldo has killed Cornelius, Caesar becomes furious and chases him up a tree, which results in Aldo falling to his death. Realizing that apes are no different from humans, Caesar agrees with MacDonald that humans are to be treated as equals in order to coexist. The movie is told as a flashback, where the beginning and ending scene takes place 600 years after Caesar's death and it shows the Lawgiver telling a story to a group of both ape and human children. He tells them the story about how Caesar fought a battle that solidified his position as ape leader and convinced him to give a joint ape-human society a chance, instead of one species dominating the other. Screenwriter Paul Dehn said the tear on Caesar's statue at the end of the film was to tell the audience that Caesar's efforts ultimately failed.Russo, Joe. Planet of the Apes Revisited p. 211. Reboot series Caesar is the main protagonist of the reboot series, sharing the previous version's compassionate nature while forbidding his followers from killing innocent humans and those who don't seek to harm them. First appearing in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar is the son of a female chimpanzee Bright Eyes who was taken from the wild to the pharmaceutical company Gen-Sys in the San Francisco Bay Area to be subjected to an experimental viral-based cure of Alzheimer's known as ALZ-112. Developed by Will Rodman, ALZ-112 genetically increases Bright Eyes' intelligence that gets passed onto Caesar as he was still in his mother's womb. When born, Caesar ends up orphaned after his mother gets killed trying to protect him, an action mistaken by lab security after she runs amok, which labels the experiment a failure. Caesar is saved by sympathetic ape handler Franklin, after which Will smuggles the little ape out of the lab and takes him back home. Caesar spends years getting raised and living with Will, displaying his enhanced intelligence and convincing his foster father that the ALZ-112 works. Following an incident where he attacks their aggressive neighbor who threatens Will's dementia-suffering father Charles, Caesar is forced to stay at the San Bruno Primate Shelter, an ape sanctuary where he is tormented by one of the caretakers while gradually taking command of the apes, while also developing a close friendship with a Bornean orangutan named Maurice. Caesar eventually proves smart enough when he breaks free from his cage, steals the ALZ-113, a stronger version of the intelligence-enhancing formula and releases it among the other captive apes. After saying his first word \\"No!\\" in a confrontation with one of the caretakers, Caesar leads the apes out of the sanctuary as they recruit other captive apes from the zoo and from Gen-Sys, rallying them to escape San Francisco and make their way to the Muir Woods while violently clashing with the police. Once in the Muir Woods, Caesar shares an emotional farewell with Rodman as he decides to live free among his own kind. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 10 years after the ALZ-113 virus decimated most of the human population, Caesar is now middle-aged, married to Cornelia and has two sons; his eldest Blue Eyes and the newborn Cornelius. While assuming the humans to have died out, Caesar discovers that humans are still alive when he sees a group from the remnants of San Francisco entering their territory and personally warns them to stay out. When the group's leader Malcolm explains they are trying to repair a dam to return power to the city, Caesar allows them to do their work. Despite the successful repairing of the dam and the growing friendship between apes and humans, Koba, Caesar's bonobo companion who hates humans, becomes disillusioned with Caesar after seeing his leader's compassion and respect for the humans. He attempts to kill Caesar, make it look like the humans did it, and leads the apes into attacking the humans and their colony. Caesar survives the gunshot and is nursed back to health by Malcolm's wife, Ellie. Blue Eyes helps Caesar free his loyal allies before Caesar confronts Koba and ultimately kills him. But Caesar realizes that the damage has already been done and convinces Malcolm to flee with his family as he and his clan face a new enemy; a paramilitary group known as Alpha-Omega. In War for the Planet of the Apes, 2 years after the events in Dawn, Caesar and the apes are fighting in an ongoing war with Alpha-Omega. After a recent victory in the Muir Woods and in an attempt to make peace, Caesar spares the lives of Preacher and three soldiers, and sends them back to Alpha-Omega's leader, colonel J. Wesley McCullough. After the battle, Blue Eyes and Rocket return from a journey, where they have discovered a place within the desert that can be safe for the apes. Later on, the Colonel launches an assault on the apes' home, where he kills Cornelia and Blue Eyes, leaving only Cornelius alive. Leaving Cornelius in the care of Blue Eyes' mate Lake, Caesar departs to confront McCullough, accompanied by Maurice, Luca and Rocket, while the other apes head for the desert. During the journey, Caesar fears that he may end up like Koba because of his desire to seek vengeance and after he unintentionally kills an albino gorilla, named Winter for betraying the location of the apes to the humans; who was indirectly responsible for Cornelia and Blue Eyes' death. He and the group are joined by a mute girl named Nova and an ape hermit named Bad Ape. When he reaches Alpha-Omega's base, a former weapons depot that was turned into a relocation facility when the virus began to spread, Caesar discovers that his clan has been captured by McCullough and he gets captured as well. Witnessing his fellow apes being forced to build a wall, Caesar learns that McCullough is fending off rival military forces who seek to destroy him for killing people, including his own men, who are infected with a mutated strain of ALZ-113 that is making humans devolve into mute primitives. While Caesar is tortured with hypothermia and starvation, Nova sneaks into the facility to give him food and water, where Rocket allows himself to be captured to create a distraction so that Nova can escape. Together, with the help of Bad Ape and Maurice, Caesar and Rocket manage to free the apes from their cages and help them escape via an underground tunnel that leads out of the facility. Caesar sends his followers away while he confronts McCullough, but the facility is subsequently attacked by the military forces. Caesar reaches McCullough but he spares his life upon realizing that he has succumbed to the infection and watches the human take his own life, who would rather die than become a primitive. In a battle among Caesar's apes, Alpha-Omega and the military forces, Caesar manages to blow up the facility's fuel supply before joining the others in taking refuge when an oncoming avalanche wipes out the remaining soldiers. Departing the facility, the remaining apes cross the desert and settle in an oasis. With Caesar dying from a wound that Preacher inflicted on him, he accepts his end with grace and dies peacefully while Maurice promises Caesar that Cornelius will know who his father was, what he stood for and what he did to protect the apes. Reception Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar in the rebooted Planet of the Apes trilogy garnered massive critical acclaim. Andrew Howley from National Geographic has compared Caesar's evolution to that of natural human evolution. Fans have embraced Caesar as one of the best film characters of the 2010s, as well as one of the most impressive displays of visual effects in cinema. Many fans were upset due to the lack of Academy Award nominations Serkis received for his performance.

In literature they are also called main virgins or excellent virgins. These are: Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Saint Margaret of Antioch, Saint Barbara and Saint Dorothea of Caesarea. Three of them - i. e. Saint Katherine, Saint Margaret and Saint Dorothea - belong to the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In iconography these four capital virgins are often depicted together or around the Virgin Mary. Occasionally, instead of the classical formation, St. Ursula is pictured instead of Saint Dorothea. Alternatively, Saint Dorothea is depicted with the attribute of Saint Ursula, an arrow, in her hands. Paintings of the four main virgins usually represent a form of the type Virgo inter Virgines, where several virgin martyrs beside the Virgin are sitting, on a bench or bank or on the ground, usually in a garden setting within an enclosure of some sort, a hortus conclusus. The great veneration of the four capital virgins testifies that the Missale Cologniense (Missal of Cologne), printed in 1494, contained the votive mass Missa de sanctis quatuor virginibus capitalibus.

He was convicted for these crimes in 1989, and received the death penalty as punishment. Since more than 100 women were killed, and it was later determined that at least five other serial killers operated in the area during the 1980s and 1990s (collectively known as The Southside Slayers), Craine was suspected of several more murders by the investigators. At the same time, his guilt was controversial and questionable, as he was diagnosed with signs of intellectual disability.  Early life Craine was born on January 6, 1957, in Los Angeles, the third in a family of four children. Early in his school years, he showed signs of intellectual disability. He left school after graduating from the 4th grade, entering into a social conflict with the rest of his family. In the early 1970s he left his parents' home and became a vagrant. Without a qualified profession, Craine was forced to engage in low-skilled labor over the next years, and changed several jobs in the construction industry. At the time of his arrest in 1987 he was unemployed.  Murders  Craine was arrested on May 29, 1987, on charges of killing a 29-year-old prostitute named Carolyn Barney. She had been raped and sodomized before being strangled, her corpse found in an empty house, not far from where her parents, and Craine's brother, lived. After finding the body, the police noticed Craine, who, due to the area being cordoned off, was watching their actions, behaving in an inappropriate manner. He was arrested, taken to the police station and subjected to long hours of questioning, during which he confessed to the murder of Barney and two other women: 24-year-old Loretta Perry (killed on January 25) and Vivian Collins (killed on March 18). Both of the women, like Barney, had been strangled and raped before death. During interrogation, Craine claimed that Collins was murdered by his older brother Roger after they had paid her for sex. According to his story, Roger strangled her during sexual intercourse; however, relatives, including their mother, provided an alibi for Roger on the day of the murder, which resulted in no charges being brought against him. Subsequently, Craine was charged with the murder of two more women: 24-year-old Gail Ficklin and 30-year-old Sheila Burton, who were killed on August 15, 1985 and November 18, 1984, respectively. Their bodies were also found not far from where other victims' corpses had been located, all of whom were near the house where Craine's parents lived.  Trial  Craine's trial began in early 1989. The main material evidence was a blood-stained shirt, the group of which coincided with the blood group of one of the victims, as well as testimonies from Craine's relatives, including his mother, who told the court that he had repeatedly expressed aggressive behavior towards prostitutes, and was spotted in a bloodied shirt after one of the murders. Other evidence pointed to him as well, that being his confession of killing Loretta Perry - initially, it was believed that she had died from a drug overdose, but after Craine's testimony, her body was exhumed and subjected to a thorough pathological study, the results of which validated Craine's claims. Craine himself, over the course of the trial, insisted on his innocence. He refuted his testimony, stating that he had been pressured into confessing, and also stated that the bloodied shirt in which, according to his relatives, he had committed the murder, didn't even belong to him. He accused his family of perjury. The lawyers of the defendant insisted that on the basis of various tests, Craine showed signs of intellectual disability, with threshold of intelligence coefficient of 69 points, a tendency to exaggeration and high susceptibility to suggestions. As a result, they requested a forensic psychiatric examination, but their application was rejected. On May 16, 1989, he was found guilty of four murders and acquitted of Burton's killing, and on June 6 of that year, the court sentence him to death.  Death  After his conviction, Craine was transferred to the San Quentin State Prison to serve his sentence, but due to health problems, he was taken to a prison hospital near the city of San Rafael, where he died on November 3, 1989, from AIDS complications.

The 7.65 kilometre-long line was opened in 1911 by the Altstätten-Gais-Bahn (AG) and has been operated by the Appenzell Railways (Appenzeller Bahnen, AB). Three sections of the line are equipped with rack under the strub system.  History End of the line in Altstätten Stadt, 1988 The line from Altstätten Stadt (town) via Stoss to Gais—where there was a connection to the line of the St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell-Altstätten-Bahn (St. Gallen-Gais-Appenzell- Altstätten Railway) to St. Gallen—was opened on 18 November 1911 and operated with three CFe 3/3 class railcars. The three rack sections with a total of 3264 metres in length are located between Altstätten and Stoss, while the rest of the line to Gais is an adhesion railway. The railway was electrically operated at 1000 Volt DC from the beginning. Another short section in the old town of Altstätten was opened on 26 June 1912 between Stadt and Rathaus (town hall). The short link along Marktgasse established a connection to the Rathaus–Bahnhof SBB line of the Altstätten–Berneck tramway, opened in 1897 and operated by the Altstätten-Berneck-Bahn (ABB), which in turn was replaced in 1940 by the Altstätten–Berneck Trolleybus. The Altstätten–Gais line was managed by the ABB, which let the trains run continuously between Gais and Altstätten SBB station. As a result of a merger in 1949, the St. Gallen-Gais- Appenzell-Altstätten Railway, SGA took over operations between Altstätten and Gais. In 1953, the catenary voltage was increased to 1500 volts, so that the then new ABDeh 4/4 6 to 8 railcars could operate freely on the whole SGA network. On 2 June 1973, tram operations were closed on the remaining section in Altstätten. Until the final closure of the Altstätten SBB–Altstätten Stadt section on 31 May 1975, the SGA trains continued to operate over this section. Due to declining frequencies and a cost recovery rate of less than 30 percent, the cantons of Appenzell Ausserrhoden and St. Gallen have established an engineering office review of whether \\"more customer-friendly and cheaper alternatives\\" would be feasible for the three rack railways of the Appenzell Railways, from Altstätten Stadt to Gais, from Rorschach Hafen to Heiden and from Rheineck to Walzenhausen. In particular, a changeover to bus operations or fully automatic operations is under discussion.

Initially a footballer must opt to play for either the senior or the under-20 team. Once a county's senior team exits the senior championship all of their under-20 players are then eligible to play for the county under-20 team. This rule was introduced to prevent player burnout and avoid scheduling conflicts when the senior and under-20 championships are played in the same summer months as both county teams have distinct panels of players. Inevitably some county under-20 teams play without their best under-20 footballers as a result of the player eligibility rule.

Early life  Albrecht was born on 15 October 1894 at Pławanice in Poland to Ferdinand and Helene Albrecht and is the eldest of there 10 children. Albrecht initially attended the local village school before he moved to study and live at the Hermannsburg Mission, in Germany, in 1913 and he graduate in 1924. World War I did interrupt his studies and, due to a childhood injury making him lame in one leg, Albrecht served in the German medical corps on the Russian front. He was awarded an Iron Cross for tending wounded soldiers when under fire. After completing his studies he received a call to work at Hermannsburg Mission, 125 km from Alice Springs, but before he could begin he received English tuition in the United States. Minna Maria Margaretha Gevers, who Albrecht met in Germany, followed him there and they married in Winnipeg, Canada on 14 September 1925. Following their marriage they sailed to Sydney where they arrived on 18 October 1925 before immediately travelling to South Australia. In South Australia, at Nuriootpa, Albrecht was ordained as a pastor in the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia on 14 February 1926.  Life in the Northern Territory  Albrecht reached Hermannsburg on 16 April 1926 where he was the replacement for Carl Strehlow who had died unexpectedly in October 1922. Gerhardt Johannsen delivered the couple to the mission, driving them from Oodnadatta, via Alice Springs. Albrecht's first priority after arriving at the mission was to learn Arrernte and he was assisted in this by Moses Tjalkabota Uraikuria, an Arrernte man of high degree and Christian evangelist, who served as a teacher and guide to the missionaries at Hermannsburg (and T.G.H. Strehlow). After achieving language sufficiency Albrecht would continue work on translating the bible, delivering sermons and training Aboriginal evangelists. Albrecht arrived in Hermannsburg during a period of extreme drought and their had already been thoughts of closure; between 1926 - 1929 it is recorded that 41 of the 51 children born at the mission died and this ill health also affected Albrecht's family with his infant daughter Helene weighing less at four then she had at two. Adults were also affected with some deaths from scurvy and general ill health, primarily from eczema, kidney disease and tuberculosis. Spurned on by this tragedy Albrecht advocated for the construction of the Kuprilya Springs Pipeline, which the Lutheran Mission Board refused to support, and he ultimately received the funds required from artists Jessie Traill and Una and Violet Teague. The completion of this pipeline, and the associated fresh fruit and vegetables they were able to grow, infant mortality decreased significantly. Albrecht later lamented: Albrecht had a deep respect for Aboriginal spirituality but he saw no way to reconcile it with Christian faith. Because of these views Albrecht removed and disposed of the Tjurunga in the sacred Manangananga Cave; Carl Strehlow, who shared Albrecht's beliefs had always acknowledged the importance of this site and the sacred objects and had left it untouched. Despite this Albrecht is remembered as an advocate for Aboriginal people, who was concerned for their material and social welfare. A part of this in action was his work with Charles Duguid and T.G.H Strehlow to establish Aboriginal settlements like Areyonga and Yuendumu. He was also instrumental in establishing the arts and crafts industry in Hermannsburg as a way for the community to make money, especially when tourists began arriving in the 1930s. He also encouraged Albert Namatjira who he helped sell his paintings. Albrecht also operated the mission as a working cattle station and established a tannery; the hides of which were used for leather-work products. In 1952 Albrecht and his family moved to Alice Springs following his wife, Minna, experiencing regular ill health. Albrecht continued his work as a pastor in Alice Springs until his retirement in 1962. In 1958 he was awarded a MBE.  Later life  In 1962 the Albrecht's retired to Linden Park in South Australia; although he continued to carry out pastoral duties. Albrecht died on 16 March 1984.

It is a coming-of-age story of a 19-year-old boy who has taken a gap year to retake the yearly College Scholastic Ability Test, and also an artist novel that seeks a possibility of life through writing. The novel is considered to have led the beginning of the Korean literature of the 1990s.  Plot   Title  \\"Adam\\" is the nickname of the novel's narrator and protagonist, the 19-year-old boy. It signifies his ignorant and immature state, like Adam of the Bible when he is thrown out of the Garden of Eden. The phrase \\"open his eyes\\" means the process of the boy entering into and learning about the world, becoming an adult. The title When Adam Opens His Eyes implies both his incorporation into the established system and securing of his own distinguishable territory.Baek Ji-yeon, \\"Writing of 'Adam,' Metonymic Variation of Desires (Winner of the Criticism Category of the 1996 Kyunghyang Daily News New Writer's Award),\\" Kyunghyang Shinmun, January 5, 1996.  Summary  \\"When I was 19 years old, all I wanted was to have a typewriter, a book of Munch's paintings, and a turntable which I can connect to a cassette player and listen to music. Those items were the only things I wished to get from the world as a 19-year-old.(p.9)\\" When Adam Opens His Eyes describes how the main character pays the price for the three things he wants to have, the typewriter, the book of Munch's paintings, and the turntable, and becomes an adult. He poses as a nude model in front of a middle-aged woman painter and acquires the book of paintings; gets anally raped by a gay man who owns a record store and gains the turntable. In this process of replacing and exchanging desires, his friend Hyeon-jae kills himself. In shock, the narrator realizes that he has to get away from 'the worship of objects in the modern world' and the desires of 'the false paradise.' He gives up college, buys the typewriter with his tuition fee, and starts to write sentences about 'the real paradise.'  False paradise  The protagonist commercializes his body to get what he wants. The woman painter claims that, in this world where love is impossible, sex is \\"the only alternative.\\" The owner of the record store attempts to dominate him with money and violence. All the characters of this novel, including the protagonist, live in 'the false paradise' where the capitalist logic of exchange rules.Jang Seok-ju, \\"I Am Literature: Jang Jung- il,\\" Naver Terms, accessed November 25, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=955887&anchorTarget;=TABLE_OF_CONTENT2&cid;=60538&categoryId;=60538#TABLE_OF_CONTENT2.Gregory C.

Coming-of-age story  At the end of the novel, the main character gives up college. Coming-of-age stories mostly end with their protagonists adapting to the world after wandering away from their life. On the contrary, in this novel, he puts off the task of adapting to the world, refuses to grow up, and decides to remain as a boy for eternity. In this light, this novel can be regarded as an 'anti-coming-of-age story.'O Se-ran, \\"Psychoanalytic Approach to When Adam Opens His Eyes,\\" Gubohakbo 2 (2007).  Artist novel  The narrator considers himself \\"Adam who opened his eyes in the false paradise,\\" refuses to grow up, and instead, immerses himself in art. At the end, he chooses writing, as a way of standing against this corrupt world. The typewriter, unlike the book of Munch's paintings and turntable, is something he buys without bargaining his body and soul. He aims to find the 'real' paradise, through the painful job that is writing with the typewriter. When Adam Opens His Eyes is an artist novel, in that it pursues the 'real' values by means of art and writing.  The beginning of the 1990s novel  The novel is viewed as the work that led the beginning of the Korean literature of the 1990s. It is set in 1988 when the Seoul Olympics were held, but it shows the general changes that occurred in the 1990s, which can be summed up as individualism, liberalism, and popular culture. The Korean literature of the 1990s started with the deconstruction of the established literary traditions and rules and the representation of the new generation's experiences and sentiments. And it was given the 'new' name, a postmodernism that has 'belatedly' arrived. When Adam Opens His Eyes stands at the head of 1990s literature, the literature of 'the new generation' and 'postmodernism.'Sim Jin-kyeong, \\"The Artificial Paradise of an Underage Boy,\\" Kukmin Ilbo, July 18, 2017, http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/print.asp?arcid=0923784745.  Critical reception  Right after its publication, a huge controversy was ignited due to the novel’s sexual depictions. The author was attacked by the public who claimed that he was soiling the world with his pornographic novel. However, critics from abroad voiced different opinions. The Japanese literary journal Shincho published its translation of the novel, and subsequently the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial, highly acclaiming Jang Jung- il as \\"the author who distinctively embodies the human experience of the consumerist society and represents the postmodernist literature.\\"\\"1001 Korean Movies You Must Watch Before You Die: When Adam Opens His Eyes,\\" Naver Terms, accessed November 25, 2019, https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=971483&cid;=42620&categoryId;=42620. Later, he once again stood in the middle of a great controversy as his novel Naege geojitmareul haebwa (내게 거짓말을 해봐, Lie to Me), similar to When Adam Opens His Eyes, was attacked and indicted for its excessive obscenities.Chae Hyeong- bok, \\"The Unbelievable Story of the Lie to Me Obscenity Trial 1,\\" Minplus, September 2, 2016, http://www.minplus.or.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1124. On the other hand, some pointed out that the novel is male-centered in its sexual descriptions and neglects the reality that is unfavorable to women.Ryu Cheol-gyun, \\"On When Adam Opens His Eyes: Modernology of the End of the World,\\" When Adam Opens His Eyes (Mihaksa, 1990), 319.  Adaptations  The 1993 film , directed by Kim Ho-seon, is adapted from this novel. It was criticized for lacking in new interpretation of the original work, the unlikely development of Adam murdering the owner of the record store, and poor depictions of the sentiments of the new generation.Ha Jae-bong, \\"When Adam Opens His Eyes, Directed by Kim Ho-seon,\\" Kyunghyang Shinmun, May 26, 1993.

The 305th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 27, 2019. Plot At the South Park Community Center, Sheila Broflovski becomes violently ill, and begins vomiting and defecating uncontrollably. At Hell's Pass Hospital, her doctor tells her sons Kyle and Ike that Sheila has a bacterial infection called C-diff, causing the beneficial bacteria in her stomach to be overrun by malignant bacteria, and that she needs a fecal transplant to replace her microbiome. After the transplant, Sheila extols the beneficial health effects of the procedure to her friends Laura Tucker, Harriet Biggle, and Linda Stotch, much to the embarrassment of her sons. Consulting a video on how to prevent ridicule over such a thing, Kyle is horrified to learn that microorganisms comprise half of the cells in his body. At night he dreams of the life forms, and the image of a bookcase that causes him to awaken with a start. Sheila's friends tell her that they would like to undergo a fecal transplant, but that their doctors would only prescribe the procedure for medical reasons, and ask her to donate a stool sample so they can perform the procedure themselves at home. Sheila declines, as she finds this inadvisable. Harriet goes to Kyle and offers to give him a copy of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order if he procures a stool sample from Sheila. Kyle refuses, but his three friends, Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick, take her up on her offer. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into the Broflovskis' basement and access the soil pipe while Sheila uses the toilet, stealing her feces, much to the anger of Kyle, who catches them in the act. Kyle consults his doctor to complain about microbiome swapping, and wonders if people with ideal health profiles like Tom Brady will become targets of those wanting such transplants. At the mention of Brady's name, however, the doctor becomes unsettled and begins a whispered inner monologue patterned after those in the film Dune (a recurring gag in the episode), noting that Kyle \\"knows\\" about Brady's microbiome, which he calls \\"The Spice Melange\\". Though Brady's \\"spice\\" is unobtainable, the doctor wonders if Kyle will be the one who will bring it to him. Harriet praises the fecal transplant procedure's benefits to her friends, having performed an at-home transplant with a turkey baster, but refuses to tell Sheila where she got the stool sample from. The boys are confronted by school counselor Mr. Mackey, who offers to buy each of them their own separate copy of Fallen Order if they obtain for him someone else's stool sample, which he also calls \\"The Spice Melange\\" in his inner dialogue. At a post-game press conference, the press repeatedly ask Brady for a stool sample, which he says he will not give or sell to anyone. As Kyle's dreams about the microbiome continue, he again is haunted by visions of the bookcase, and develops the ability to see the microorganisms covering his body when awake. At another shared meal, Harriet, ill and covered in vomit stains, confronts her friends and angrily accuses Sheila of tainting her feces in some way to sabotage her transplant. Linda and Laura then become ill themselves, having stolen the remainder of Harriet's stolen sample and performed their own transplants. As Hell's Pass Hospital fills with local citizens suffering from C-diff, a doctor tells police detective Harrison Yates that the outbreak began at the restaurant where patrons became infected by Sheila's friends. He explains that because the turkey basters they used for their transplants are only used once a year at Thanksgiving, they spend the rest of the year collecting bacteria. He then says the hospital is out of healthy donor feces, and that because enough healthy feces could not be harvested in time to give all the patients transplants, half of South Park will die. The boys go to Brady's house, where they wait with other people hoping to acquire his \\"Spice Melange\\". Brady demands everyone leave, but Kyle appears and leads everyone to Brady's living room bookcase, which he reveals to be a secret door to a hidden room where Brady keeps his jarred feces. Brady explains that he stopped flushing it because people kept breaking his pipes to acquire them. The boys bring the feces to the hospital, where it is used to treat all the infected patients. When Sheila asks Kyle how he knew how to resolve the crisis, Kyle explains that his microbiome knew, saying he has learned that the creatures inside him are part of him, and will now \\"trust his gut\\" a bit more. A running joke purports the episode to be \\"one for the ladies\\", with a unique intro and bumpers between commercial breaks repeatedly proclaiming this. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN gave the episode a 9.7 of out 10, stating in his review, \\"South Park may not be as consistent as it once was, but the series can still deliver episodes that rival the best of its golden years. By combining a classic format with hilarious poop jokes and the most bizarrely entrancing Dune parody imaginable, this episode hits all the right notes.\\" Joe Matar of Den of Geek gave the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating, \\"It's not a particularly bad episode. In fact, in what has been a largely boring, unfunny season, it's probably the best one so far. Still, in the end, like so many South Park episodes, how much you enjoy yourself will depend on how much you're into the running gags that get repeated again and again throughout. In this case, those gags are a Dune reference and women puking and shitting a lot. For me, this stuff had diminishing returns. I'd rate 'Turd Burglars' somewhere between 'meh' and 'fine.'\\" Stephanie Williams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of \\"B\\", saying in her review, \\"The ladies received the same power as the men of South Park, and that's shitty power, no pun intended.\\" References Category:South Park (season 23) episodes Category:Television episodes about theft Category:Television episodes set in hospitals Category:Works about feces ","title":"Turd Burglars"},{"id":"62428154","text":"Rizwana \\"Riz\\" Lateef (born 25 September 1979) is a British journalist, newsreader and deputy news manager at the BBC.

Early life  Vagif Gurbanov, originally from Qovlar, Tovuz, Azerbaijan, was born in 1967 in Baku. In 1992, he was legally declared dead by Baku City Nizami District Court.  Early military service  Gurbanov was a graduate of Borisoglebsk Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots in Borisoglebsk. After completing his education, he served in the USSR Air Force as an officer in the Sitalchay Aviation Regiment, in an airbase organized during the Afghan war and equipped with Su-25 aircraft. He later served in one of the aviation regiments in Azerbaijan. He participated in the creation of military regiments in Ganja, Yevlakh and Kurdamir.  Nagorno Karabakh War   Hijacking of the Su-25 military aircraft  According to the preliminary plan, Su-25 aircraft from the Sitalchay military airport of the CIS Air Force, located at the 80th dislocated air regiment, was to be flown to Khojaly during the training flight and bombed Khojaly Airport. To this end, the Ministry of Internal Affairs official Akif Hajiyev was in contact with Vagif, promising that he would produce documents under a different name and Vagif would be able to live under a new name following the implementation of the plan. But Gurbanov did not consider this plan to be real as the ammunition on board during the training flight was not enough for the realization of the plan. According to the amended plan, on April 8, 1992, Senior Lieutenant Gurbanov hijacked and transferred Su-25 military aircraft to Azerbaijan with the assistance of Azerbaijani fellow countrymen, technical aircraft Lieutenant Fuad Mammadov and Chief Airman Sergeant Akif Guliyev. It was the first fighter aircraft in the arsenal of the Azerbaijani Air Force. Chief technician Gulbudag Binyatov was also involved in the hijacking. The plane landed at Yevlakh civil airport. Immediately following the hijacking of the aircraft, special inspection and control measures were instituted. The search crew was tasked with destroying the military aircraft unconditionally and without warning. Therefore, the military aircraft was temporarily hidden under straw at Sheki airport outside the settlements. Gulbudag Binyatov and other aviation experts, involved in the hijacking of a military aircraft, left the Sitalchay military airport just two days later in order to avoid suspicions. Although the Russian government demanded the return of the aircraft, the aircraft remained at the airport. The Ministry of Defence of Russia created a special squad consisting of two MiG-23s at Georgia's Vaziani Military Base, to destroy the hijacked Su-25; but could not succeed.  Major battles  Gurbanov's first aviation assignment was duty in Shusha, where he operated the first fighter aircraft of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the first time. On May 8, 1992 he began military flights over Shusha. Low-flying aircraft resulted in damage to aircraft engine. The new engine was purchased from the Georgian Vaziani Military Base, sponsored by Surat Huseynov. On May 8 and 9, Gurbanov's raid killed 30 soldiers of Armenian armed groups and wounded 120 of them. According to Armenians' allegations, all the dead were civilians. On May 9, 1992, Vagif Gurbanov attacked an Armenian Yak-40 aircraft flying from Khankendi to Yerevan. Shooting down aircraft made a safe and emergency landing at Sisian airfield with no fatalities. All passengers were evacuated safely and the plane was completely ignited. The fire completely destroyed the aircraft. On June 12, a Su-25 aircraft operated by Vagif Gurbanov broke down the enemy's defensive line in Shaumyan and resulted in the release of up to 20 settlements from Armenian military units. Gurbanov also participated in the battles around Martuni, the villages of Shosh, and Khramort in the Askeran district, as well as in Chaykand and Ai-Paris. As a result, the opposing party suffered heavy losses.  Death  On June 13, 1992, Vagif conducted three combat flights on Aghdara-Goranboy direction. Gurbanov's Su-25 aircraft was shot down by the Armenian armed forces at about 4-5 pm with a Shilka rifle near Nakhichevanik- Askeran. According to witnesses, Vagif Gurbanov was dropped by parachute from aircraft at that moment, but the enemy shoots him from the ground by SA-14 missile. Battalion Commander Fred Asif's brother, Adalat Maharramov, remembers those days and states that he saw Vagif being shot down and fired by the Armenians. Although the Azerbaijani side attacked to save Gurbanov of the enemy, it was too late. The death of the pilot, who threatened the Armenians, was met with joy on the Armenian side. Armenian television has repeatedly shown the remnants of the aircraft. However, it is not known if Vagif was alive. It was rumored that Gurbanov became a landmine victim. Even though the intelligence team had been sent to that location, they returned empty-handed. As per another rumor, Vagif survived and was taken to an unknown direction after being taken to Aghdam hospital. His friend Fuad Mammadov had been said that he was found wounded at Zabrat Airport. However, none of this information has been confirmed. An investigation was carried out on Vagif Gurbanov, with the instructions of Namig Abbasov, the chairman of the State Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and Missing Persons. But that doesn't work either. Family members and his friend Fuad Mammadov also visit psychic and fortune teller as the last hope. No matter how weird it is, no \\"visionary\\" says that he died. A submission had already been made to give the title of National Hero to Vagif Gurbanov. However, at that time, Deputy Prime Minister Surat Huseynov advised that they should wait while he would be alive, and that it would have negative consequences for Vagif in terms of the Armenian attitude. In later years the issue had not been reconsidered. Vagif Gurbanov and his comrades, as well as servicemen involved in the hijacking of Su-25 aircraft were not given any honorary titles.

Development It is proposed for Scottish airline Loganair which operate the few minutes long flights to the Orkney Islands' six airfields, including the world's shortest, the Westray to Papa Westray flight scheduled for 1.5 min. The Orkney Islands already have wind turbines and in Kirkwall harbour the inter-island ferries can already powered by locally produced hydrogen via fuel cells. Less noisy, the kit could be modified for similar-size aircraft and could be used for parachuting depending on the charging speed. Approved by the EASA, Cranfield built the X-48 blended wing body scale-model for NASA, and works with Airbus and Rolls-Royce to develop the hybrid E-Fan X converted BAe 146 demonstrator. Cranfield wants to develop a STC with off-the-shelf parts: current batteries would give it a 30 min endurance, sufficient for most island flights, and more with a range extender. By avoiding Avgas and with the lower maintenance of the simpler system, operators could attain a return on investment in 2–3 years with additional investment for charging infrastructure. To back the development, Cranfield applied for UK government grants through the Aerospace Technology Institute and UK Research and Innovation, and approached private enterprises. If funded for £10 million, a prototype could fly in 2021, and the kit could be available in 2022-23. Led by Cranfield Aerospace Solutions (CAeS), Project Fresson (named after Scottish pioneer aviator Ted Fresson) started on 1 October 2019, to fly a demonstrator within 30 months before an EASA STC within another 6-12 months. Partners include Britten-Norman, Rolls-Royce plc for the power management system, Denis Ferranti for the electric motors, Delta Motorsport for the battery pack, and Warwick Manufacturing Group for battery testing. It targets a 60 min endurance plus 30 min reserves and with energy five times cheaper than Avgas and reduced maintenance, the conversion cost could be recovered in three years. Half of the £18 million ($22 million) funding come from the partners and the other half from the UK government. Of 800 Islanders in service, around 600 are used for short flights. After that, CAeS wants to convert an existing 19-seat airliner to hybrid-electric propulsion, then use this EASA-certified power train in a new-design 19-seat. Rolls-Royce may evolve the design into a series hybrid with a M250 turboshaft instead of the twin piston engines, before powering 19-seat commuter airliner. By November 2019, first flight was scheduled for April 2022.

The film is set on a space station in the future. The crew suffers traumatic stress and considers abandoning their mission after they observe what they believe to be the destruction of Earth. The film is shown as a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards.  Plot  In 2190, the space station Pangea refuels ships bound for Earth's first space colony, Europa One. Rotating crews from different countries maintain Pangea in 10-year shifts. Four American astronauts arrive to begin their term: Captain John Laine, engineer Jackie Miller, doctor Richard Valin, and Lisa Brown. In their first year, the crew interacts amicably, and Laine and Miller begin a romantic relationship. With each passing year, the crew drifts apart. By the fifth year, isolation takes a toll. Laine experiences night terrors, and Valin has stopped showering. Valin is forced to deem the crew mentally unfit to continue the mission. As the crew comes to terms with failing their mission, shockwaves from a massive explosion damage Pangea. Laine regains consciousness and finds Miller, who informs him Brown was seriously injured. Valin is unresponsive and in shock. The crew repeatedly tries to contact Earth but, after 62 hours, receives no response. Pangea eventually locates an asteroid field where Earth once was, implying the planet was destroyed. Brown succumbs to her injuries. Valin is convinced the Earth was destroyed. Miller suggests using the escape pod to search for survivors, namely her daughter, but Valin notes there are not enough supplies to return to Pangea if Earth is truly gone. Laine suggests traveling to Europa instead, which Valin despondently rejects. Miller, who refuses to believe her daughter is gone, attempts to board the escape pod herself. The pod malfunctions; Laine saves Miller, but they lose the pod. Three months pass. Pangea's life support systems reach 55%, Valin is talking to himself regularly, and Miller self-medicates with sedatives. Laine asks Miller to help him devise a survival plan. The two decide to separate Pangea's two stations with a controlled explosion, allowing their oxygen supplies to replenish adequately. Valin sinks into defeatist nihilism and sees no point to their plan. Laine is abruptly awakened by the ship's alarm to find Valin floating away from Pangea untethered. Valin says he has accepted his fate but panics at the emptiness of space. Laine fails to rescue Valin. As Miller proposes they consume suicide pills, she sees a space shuttle float by. Laine boards the shuttle and recovers three unconscious, malnourished astronauts. Captain Diane Ures is the first to awaken. She explains her team comprises French astronauts, Vincent and Thomas. They, and two Americans, were training on the International Space Station when the explosion destroyed the station and forced them to head for Pangea, a three month trip. The two American crew members died, which allowed them to survive on limited supplies. The presence of survivors renews the spirits of both crews, and they celebrate together. However, Miller calculates the addition of more crew members will deplete Pangea's life support systems within one month instead of three years. She insists on traveling back to Earth in the ISS shuttle until Diane admits she saw Earth explode violently while receiving a final transmission saying, \\"What have we done? Do not return. Go to Europa.\\" Vincent and Thomas express hostility towards the Pangea crew. Diane tells Laine her team discovered the lack of remaining life support, but she remains diplomatic. Vincent confesses to murdering his two American colleagues to ensure his own survival. He and Thomas stage a mutiny, kill Diane, then attack Laine and Miller. Laine is stabbed, and the two French astronauts escape. Miller chases Thomas into Station Two and kills him after a brief scuffle. Vincent and Laine scuffle in Station One over the station controls. Vincent overpowers Laine and triggers the explosion, breaking Pangea into two halves. Laine opens the outer hatch, expelling Vincent into space. Miller, still trapped in Station Two, contacts Laine over the intercom. The explosion damaged the shuttle, leaving Laine unable to travel to Miller in time. As Miller drifts beyond communication range, Laine promises her he will find her one day. In 2198, Laine lives alone, appearing disheveled and suffering from hallucinations yet scanning space tirelessly. He locates the missing station on Day 3022. In a log entry, he explains that he finally understands why Miller always reserved hope for her loved ones despite understanding the reality. With the shuttle now repaired, he boards Station Two unsure if Miller is still alive. He finds Miller slumped in a makeshift quarters, weakened but alive.

Having played a handfull of games at Right back for St Patrick's Athletic the previous season, Waterford manager Alan Reynolds deemed it to be Feely's best position, making him his first choice in that position, as he made his debut on the opening night of the season in a 2–1 win over Derry City at the RSC. Feely's first goal for Waterford came on 18 May 2018, scoring in a 3–6 defeat at home to Limerick. He followed that up by scoring the opening goal in a 4–0 win over Derry City a week later.

The season turned out to be a disappointment for the club as they finished in 6th place, but on a personal level it was a success for Feely as he featured in 40 games, scored 2 goals and was named as Waterford's Player of the Year after another impressive year for the Right back.

The nine lakes which constitute the lake cluster are Phewa, Begnas, Rupa, Khaste, Dipang, Maidi, Gunde, Neurani, Kamalpokhari and Pokhara Seti Catchment. The lakes are fresh water lakes in the Nepalese Himalayas. The lakes are located in and around Pokhara metropolitan city of Kaski District. Phewa and Kamalpokhari lakes are located in the town of Pokhara while the rest of the lakes are in the town of Lekhnath. On 2 February 2016, it was declared as Ramsar site, covering including the surrounding catchment area. Water bodies constitute 3.5% of the catchment area of lake cluster.. Pokhara Valley Lake conservation committee was established in 2008 with an objective to conserve the ecosystem around the lakes. Plant and animal life Cluster Lake has unique floral and faunal importance with rare and vulnerable species. Flora The area has 60 aquatic plants and over 300 terrestrial plants. Rare marsh wild rice species Oryza rufipogon is found here. Some other threatened and important plant species found here are Apostasia wallichii and Michelia champaca, Asparagus racemosus, Bulbophyllum plyrhiza, Cymbidium iridioides, Dendrobium densiflorum, D. fimbiatum and Alsophila spinulosa, Dioscorea deltoidea, Oberonia nepalensis, Oberonia iridifolia, Oroxylum indicum and Papilionantheteres species Tinospora cordifolia and monogeneric species like Ceratophyllum demersum, Trapa natans and Typha angustifolia.All these lakes are sub-surface drainage type . Phewa is meso-eutrophic, Lake Bagnas is meso-eutrophic and rest of the lakes are eutrophic. Fauna There are 168 species of birds found in the area. Most of the birds are wetland birds. Some of the important birds found here are Spiny Babbler (Turdoides nepalensis), Nepal Wren Babbler (Pnoepyga immaculate), Comb duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), Baer’s Pochard (Aythya baeri), Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca). The lake holds 28 fish species, 11 amphibian species, 28 reptile species and 32 mammal species. The population of otters is declining around the lakes. The lake area is also home to few globally threatened species like clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), common leopard (Panthera pardusfusca), and Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata). Uses The human population around the lakes is about 378,000. The human population consists of 101 local ethnic groups/castes. These lakes are of great use for the people living around them. They provide groundwater recharge, flood control and sediment trapping. The lakes play a dominant role for the people dependent upon them as they provide a livelihood. The lakes provide irrigation, wetland resource, fishing, religious sites and tourism opportunity. They help to provide balance between local hydrology and ecology. Threats The increase in human population has resulted in increasing pressure on the lakes.The encroachment for agriculture, excessive fishing, eutrophication, live stock grazing and infrastructure developments have become a threat to the lakes.The invasive weeds are Parthenium hysterophorus, Mikania micrantha, Pontederia crassipes, Leersia hexandra, and Pistia stratiotes .The major exotic fish species include Tilapia nilotica (Tilapia) and Clarias gariepinus (African Catfish).

It is known that the Brotherhood of the Holy Sacrament certainly owned the work in 1535. Whether they had given the order to make it is unknown. The triptych was probably made before 1466, which makes it older than The Last Supper.  Description  Torture of Saint Erasmus is depicted on the triptych. He was the patron saint of the skippers and in the Netherlands in particular of the Baltic Seafarers. His attribute was the capstan, a winch on which the anchor chains were rolled up. Historian Johan Huizinga uses the term 'dermwinderken' for the Erasmus triptych, because the central panel shows how, according to legend, the intestines of Saint Erasmus were pulled out of his body with the help of a windlass. As a result, from the fifteenth century he was also called against stomach diseases. Erasmus undergoes this without betraying any emotion; the executioners carry out their duties seriously and Emperor Diocletian and his three companions, who attend the event, appear to be in a meditative state just as the saints on the side panels.'Triptiek met de marteling van de heilige Erasmus', Erfgoedplus (https://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/24062A51.priref.33) On the side panels two persons are depicted, on the left is the Church Father Jerome and on the right is Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercian Order. They are, respectively, depicted with a lion who has rid Jerome of a thorn in his leg; and a devil who lies at the feet of Bernard and symbolizes the torments that the saint has resisted. These two men have virtually no link with the subject of the central panel. Nevertheless, they have been brought together with the other figures in one landscape that runs through the panels. Instead of bringing the narrative aspects and horror of the legend of Saint Erasmus to the fore, Bouts sought to emphasize the holiness of Erasmus, Jerome and Bernard and to present them as protectors and as objects of devotion.Ridderbos, Bernhard. Schilderkunst in de Bourgondische Nederlanden. Davidsfonds Uitgeverij, 2014.

The spider's abdomen bears 14 spines (six on each side and two in the rear) and is yellow in color with brown or black sigilla and a strongly wrinkled ventral side. The World Spider Catalog currently treats this taxon as a spiny orb- weaver spider in the genus Gasteracantha. In 1849, H. Nicolet included it in the genus Gasteracantha along with 18 other species he described from Chile. Nicolet described G. flava as being closely allied to another species described at the same time, Gasteracantha spissa, which had the same number and shape of spines and was very similar. Subsequent authors refined Nicolet's species, and in a 1996 publication Herbert Levi wrote, \\"All Nicolet's species seem to belong in Phoroncidia (Theridiidae).\\" Levi transferred the 14-spined taxon spissa, described by Nicolet as very similar to G. flava, to the genus Phoroncidia, creating the new combination Phoroncidia spissa. However, Levi did not explicitly address G. flava, so it remains in Gasteracantha as of November 2019, though its purported sister species now belongs to Phoroncidia and no other Gasteracantha species has more than six spines.

Overview  The Katsura-bon is the oldest surviving Man'yōshū manuscript, having been copied around the middle of the Heian period. It is named for its having formerly been in the possession of the Katsura-no-miya house. It consists of 175 poems and an index of another 37. These are written on a single scroll containing 109 poems from Book IV, or roughly 1/3 of the book, along with another fragment (occasionally called the Toganoo-gire 栂尾切) containing 66 poems along with an index of 37 more. It was likely copied by , although other theories propose Ki no Tsurayuki, Minamoto no Shitagō, Fujiwara no Yukinari and Minamoto no Toshifusa. It is written on beautiful coloured paper decorated with images of flowers, birds, grass and trees. It is said to show hardly any influence of jiten readings, and to preserve the vestiges of the koten readings. The stylized seal imprinted on the reverse indicates that it was in the holdings of Emperor Fushimi. The scroll was held by Maeda Matsu, the wife of Maeda Toshiie, and in the time of Maeda Toshitsune entered the holdings of the Katsura-no-miya household. In 1881, with the extinction of the Katsura-no- miya house, it passed into the possession of imperial household.

Family  Theklas parents were the acting couple Caroline, née Krüger, and Carl Demmer. Numerous important Viennese actors and singers came from this marriage, among them * Friedrich Demmer (1785 in Berlin – 15 April 1838 in Mariahilf bei Wien).

Career  Kneisel-Demmer was active from 1817 to 1824 as a singer at the Theater am Kärntnertor and from 1824 to 1826 as an actress at the Hofburgtheater. She was then engaged by director Carl Carl as \\"Localsoubrette\\" to the Theater an der Wien. Among other things she played in Raimund's ' the role of the stone-breaker-wife Mirzel and in 1831 the chamber maid Linda in ', as well as with Nestroy in February 1832 the widow Adelheid in ' and in March of this year the kitchengretl Roselheid in '. That she had a very good reputation as a singer and actress was shown by a report in the Allgemeinen Musikalischen Anzeiger of 15 March 1832 (No 11, ): :Once and for all we must also praise the brave and diligent actress and singer Mad.The married actresses were given \\"Mad.

It was ordered by the Brotherhood of the holy Sacrament. Sacrament towers were frequently built from the mid-15th century. This are tabernacles in the shape of a tower, in which the sacred sacrament, a host, was kept. This design was no exception: for this reason doors are provided on the choir side and in the direction of the two northern chapel chapels, which the Brotherhood of the Holy Sacrament was given in 1432 from the chapter of Saint Peter. Sacrament towers were regularly built until the 17th century. Then the Church decided that the tabernacle should be placed in the center of the altar. The tower in St. Peter's Church was built between 1537 and 1539 and this makes it the oldest preserved sacrament tower in Belgium. In addition to these, six others were once found in Leuven, namely in the churches of Sint-Jacob, Saint Quentin (two copies), Park Abbey, Sint-Geertrui Abbey and in the Celestine Monastery in Heverlee. Only the first one still exists. In Flemish Brabant there are still a few sacrament towers from the 16th and 17th centuries that can be seen, especially in Zoutleeuw, Zuurbemde and Diest.  Description  The structure of the sacrament tower consists of an open landing as a base, with the actual tabernacle above it and then reliefs with the passion of Christ and finally a richly elaborated tower crown. Six niches on the third level crown the sides of the tabernacle. It contained reliefs depicting passion scenes, but all but one were lost, just like the apostle figures who stood around the tabernacle. These statues were placed back during a restoration of the tower. The only remaining original fragment is the Grace Chair, in which a throning God the Father supports the dead body of his Son. The theme of the mercy seat is represented three more times in St. Peter's Church, namely on the back of the right side panel of the Edelheeretriptiek (1443), and in the burial monuments of Michaël Scribaens (circa 1504) and Adolf van Baussele (circa 1559).'Sacramentstoren van de Sint-Pieterskerk', Erfgoedplus (https://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/24062A51.priref.17520) The actual tabernacle occupies the second floor and is enclosed by panels with tracery and Eucharistic symbols (chalice and lamb). The twelve apostles are depicted in the niches on the corner supports: they were witnesses to the establishment of the sacrament of the Eucharist.Smeyers, Maurits. Dirk Bouts.

It can be used to transport and compress a liquid. In industries heavy-duty pumps are used to move water, chemicals, slurry, food, oil and so on. Depending on their action, pumps are classified into two types — Centrifugal Pumps and Positive Displacement Pumps. While centrifugal pumps impart momentum to the fluid by motion of blades, positive displacement pumps transfer fluid by variation in the size of the pump’s chamber. Centrifugal pumps can be of rotor or propeller types, whereas positive displacement pumps may be gear-based, piston-based, diaphragm-based, etc. As a general rule, centrifugal pumps are used with low viscosity fluids and positive displacement pumps are used with high viscosity fluids. Parameters and Definitions Volume flow rate (Q), specifies the volume of fluid flowing through the pump per unit time. Thus, it gives the rate at which fluid travels through the pump. Given the density of the operating fluid, mass flow rate (ṁ) can also be used to obtain the volume flow rate. The relationship between the mass flow rate and volume flow rate (also known as the capacity) is given by: :\\\\dot m = \\\\rho \\\\cdot Q Where ρ is the operating fluid density. One of the most important considerations, as a consequence, is to match the rated capacity of the pump with the required flow rate in the system that we are designing. Discharge Head, is the net head obtained at the outlet of a pump. For a centrifugal pump, the discharge pressure depends on the suction or inlet pressure as well, along with the fluid’s density. Thus, for the same flow rate of the fluid, we may have different values of discharge pressure depending on the inlet pressure. Thus, discharge head (the height which the fluid can reach after getting pumped) varies according to its operating conditions. Total Head is the difference between the height to which the fluid can rise at the outlet and the height to which it can rise at the inlet for a centrifugal pump. This is a crucial parameter for pump selection and is a popularly used parameter for ascertaining industrial requirements. By eliminating the inlet head, we remove the effect of the supplied pressure to the pump and are left with only the pump’s energy (head) contribution to the fluid flow. Schematic representation of pressure heads in a pump. Factors Affecting Pump Selection Flow Rate – The flow rate is necessary to select a pump because the head characteristics of a pump will be affected by the flow rate of the system. It is necessary to importantly measure or ascertain this parameter, since the flow rate is critical in many industrial processes, especially in chemical industries. Static Head – The difference between the inlet tank fluid surface elevation and the discharge tank fluid surface elevation. Friction Head – The friction head accounts for the frictional losses in the pumping system. The value of the friction head can be found from available data-tables depending on the flow parameters such as fluid viscosity, pipe dimensions, flow rate, etc. Total Head – It is obtained by adding the friction and static heads. It gives a measure of the amount of energy imparted by the pump to the fluid. Using the total head and the flow rate, the appropriate dynamic pump (centrifugal pump) can be selected. Selection Using Pump Characteristics Whenever there is a need to select a pump for any industrial or personal requirement, it is important to determine the required total head for the operation and the required flow rate. All this data is important because each pump which is manufactured by manufacturer has a characteristic value of head and flow at which it leads to maximum efficiency operation. For example, in a process industry if there is a need to transport chemical liquids at a specific flow rate for a particular chemical reaction to take place then there is a need to ascertain both the dynamic head (which is related to the flow rate) and static head. After calculating both the head and the flow rate, the pump curves given by the manufacturer are referred and the pump giving the maximum efficiency at the operational condition is selected. It should however be noted that the best efficiency point is not the best operating point in practice, because the pump curve describes how a centrifugal pump performs in isolation from plant equipment. How it operates in practice is determined by the resistance of the system it is installed in.\\"What is the system curve?\\" Characteristic Pump Curves Pump Characteristic curve; the head produced reduces with the discharge of the pump. Pump curves are quite useful in the pump selection, testing, operation and maintenance. Pump performance curve is a graph of differential head against the operating flow rate. They specify performance and efficiency characteristics. Performance tests are done on the pumps to verify the claims made by the pump maker. It is quite possible that with time in the plant, requirements of the process along with the infrastructure and conditions may change considerably. In that case pump curves are used to verify whether the pumps would still be the best fit for modified requirements. Selecting Using Pump Curves Pump performance curves are important indicators of pump characteristics provided by the manufacturer. These curves are fundamental in predicting the variation in the differential head across the pump, as the flow changes. However, such curves are not limited to the head, and variation in other parameters such as power, efficiency or NPSH with flow can also be shown on similar plots by the manufacturer. Due to mechanical and power constraints head provided by the pump drops as it pushes more quantity of fluid. In other words, when there is an increase the flow rate (for the same impeller diameter), there is a drop in differential head that the pump is capable of providing. The two are related as follows:[Zibin, X (2015) \\"Study on the H-Q Characteristic Curves of Centrifugal Pump with Inlet Pre-whirl\\" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7462730] H=A-BQ Here A and B depend on the geometric parameters and the rotational speed of the pump, and are assumed to be constant for the purpose of comparison. However, this simple linear relationship undergoes modification on account of various losses and a non-linear, decreasing H-Q relationship is seen in the pump characteristic curve. Pump characteristic curve; the shut-off heads are highlighted From the curve, it is observed that even when the differential head drops off, the output obtained increases because the product of flow rate and head increases (recall that the net pump output is given by P_o=\\\\rho gHQ and the efficiency is \\\\eta =\\\\rho gHQ /P_i). This is due to the increase in flow rate. However, the reduction in the discharge head means that the pump consumes more power to push the additional fluid that we need (on account of the increased flow rate). After a specific point, known as the best efficiency point, the effect of reduction in the obtained head outweighs the increase in the flow rate. As a consequence, the power starts reducing hereafter, and the efficiency starts falling. Mathematically, the effect of flow rate on the efficiency is given by[Zaman, MH, et al.\\"Selection of a low-cost high efficiency centrifugal pump\\" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374273] : \\\\eta=k_1 C_Q-k_2 C_Q^3, where C_Q=Q/ND^3 is called the capacity constant, and k_1 and k_2 are constants that depend on the pump design and rotation speed. Because of this contradicting feature a point of optimal efficiency is achieved for the pump. Our target should be to select pump which operates close to the maximum efficiency point for required operational requirement.[Jahmeerbacus,M.I. (2015) \\"Flux vector control of an induction motor drive for energy-efficient operation of a centrifugal pump\\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7093736 \\" To reduce energy loss, the pump should be operated at efficiencies equal or close to the Best Efficiency Point (BEP)\\" This is the best efficiency point for pump and plotted on Pump Efficiency Curve.

The series is overseen by the two sports' governing bodies, the Gaelic Athletic Association and Australian Football League. This page lists results of each test match in the series. Click on the a series year for a more detailed recording of results. Results Though the first Australian Football World Tour took place in 1967, it wasn't until 1984 that the first organised series sanctioned by the two governing bodies occurred. The four series that took place from 1984 to 1990 featured three test matches each, with the winning nation being the one to secure at least two victories. Since 1998 each series has been played over two matches, with the winning nation being the one to score the highest amount on aggregate over the two tests. This excludes the 2014 and 2015 series, which were both one-off matches. Scores are given in the form [goals] [overs] [behinds] ([points]). A goal equals 6 points, an over 3, and a behind 1. So 2.9.7 (46) means 2 goals, 9 overs and 7 behinds; 2(6) + 9(3) + 7(1) = 12 + 27 + 7 = 46 points in total. - style=\\";background:#ccf;font-size: 85%\\"   Series  Date  Home Nation   Away Nation   Ground  Crowd   Series Winner  - fff;font-size: 85%;\\"  1  rowspan=\\"3\\"  center;\\"1984  21/10  Ireland  4.8.9 (57)  cfc;\\" Australia  cfc;\\" 2.15.13 (70)  Páirc Uí Chaoimh  8,000  rowspan=\\"3\\"+14  rowspan=\\"3\\"!div style=\\"background:Navy;

Harrison, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2018 term. The Court held that civil service of a lawsuit against the government of Sudan was invalid because the civil complaints and summons had been sent to the embassy of Sudan in DC rather than to the Sudanese Foreign Minister in Khartoum. This case is notable because it arose out of the bombing of the USS Cole, a terrorist attack perpetrated by al Qaeda in 2000. The United States federal government's decision to file a friend of the court brief supporting Sudan against a lawsuit filed by injured United States service members also sparked controversy.The administration's amicus curiae brief condemned the terrorist attack but argued that allowing service of process at embassies would undermine the principle of mission inviolability.  Background  In October 2000, the USS Cole, a United States Navy destroyer, was attacked by suicide bombers in the port of Aden in Yemen. The blast killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 others. Though the attack was attributed to the terrorist group al Qaeda, family members of the slain sailors filed a lawsuit against the government of Sudan, accusing it of complicity and providing material support to the attackers. Foreign governments are generally immune from lawsuits in United States courts; however, an exception exists under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. This law allows for lawsuits against entities listed by the US State Department as state sponsors of terrorism. In addition, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2016 allows for punitive damages against state sponsors of terrorism, and can be applied retroactively to incidents that took place before the law was enacted.  In lower courts  In July 2004, family members of the sailors filed a lawsuit against Sudan for more than $100 million, alleging the Sudanese government provided support to the attackers and were complicit in the deaths of their relatives on the USS Cole. Though the doctrine of sovereign immunity generally bars lawsuits against foreign governments in US courts, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act creates an exception for countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. In March 2007, the district court found in favor of the sailors' families, ruling that Sudan was liable for the USS Cole attack after a two-day bench trial. The families sought up to $105 million in damages, but the damages were reduced to $13.4 million ($8 million in compensatory damages as well as $5.4 million in interest) as a result of the Death on the High Seas Act, which limited damages by disallowing emotional distress claims. In 2010, a second lawsuit was filed against Sudan by 15 injured sailors and their families, seeking compensatory damages as well as punitive damages, which are permitted retroactively under the 2008 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). The complaint and civil summons were filed at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, DC, where they were accepted by a staffer at the embassy. In 2012, the plaintiffs in this suit prevailed in a default judgment and were awarded close to $315 million in compensatory and punitive damages following Sudan's failure to appear. To satisfy the claim, a federal judge ordered several banks (BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA and Mashreqbank PSC) to turn over Sudanese assets held in their custody. Sudan then appealed the decision to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2014, claiming that proper procedures were not followed in serving the initial complaint in the 2010 case. The case was heard by a three-judge panel comprising Circuit Court judges Denny Chin and Gerard E. Lynch as well as District Court Judge Edward R. Korman. Writing for a unanimous panel, Chin upheld the district court's ruling..Harrison v. Republic of Sudan, 802 F.3d 399 (2d Cir. 2015); rehearing denied, 838 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2016). Sudan appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted a writ of certiorari in 2018.Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, 138 S. Ct. 2671 (2018). Kannon Shanmugam, then a partner at the DC law firm Williams & Connolly, argued the case on behalf of Harrison. Christopher Curran of the New York City law firm White & Case, represented the government of Sudan. Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Erica Ross appeared on behalf of the United States government, presenting the United States's perspective in support of Sudan.  Supreme court opinion   Majority opinion  In an 8-to-1 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FISA) when they sent their complaint and civil summons to the Sudanese embassy in DC rather than directly to the Sudanese Foreign Minister in Khartoum. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito ruled that the most 'natural' reading of the text of the FSIA was that the civil process had to be made directly to the foreign minister's office in the foreign state, and that the correct address for the foreign minister was the location that the foreign minister lived or worked—not the embassy. Alito's opinion also noted that this interpretation is consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as well as the United States's own policy of not accepting service at American embassies when the US government is sued overseas.  Dissent  In his dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, an embassy should be appropriate places to serve legal paper's to that country's foreign minister.  Effect  As a result of this opinion, the Second Circuit's ruling was reversed and the plaintiffs' award was overturned. The plaintiffs were however permitted to file suit again, either by serving the papers directly to the Sudanese foreign minister in Khartoum or asking the United States Secretary of State to do so via diplomatic channels. In February 2020, Sudan announced that it would settle the case with the USS Cole victims for $30 million. Though Sudan continues to deny any involvement with the attack, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stated that it would make the payment in order to normalize relations with the rest of the world and meet the US's conditions for removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Sudan's announcement follows the ouster of its former president Omar al-Bashir and the inauguration of a new interim ruling council headed by Hamdok, as well as negotiations between Sudan and the United States to reestablish diplomatic relationships.

They exemplify vernacular architecture, the traditional domestic architectural style of the \\"well-to-do class\\" of the Canary Islands. Two specimens remain.Mention of the House of the Count in the portal of Historical Heritage of the Cabildo de Gran Canaria Source: Cabildo insular de Gran Canaria  History  In the early 19th century, the land was owned by Alonso Riverol's family. Two centuries later, the land was passed to the Sánchez-Ochando family. The land spread across family members via inheritance. Some became the property of Juan del Castillo Westherling, who was then Count of the Vega Grande de Guadalupe. The set was colloquially known as 'Casa del Conde' (English: House of the Count). The houses were known and highlighted in the Historic Set of the City of Guía, because of how they remained assets of one family, the proximity of the buildings, and as a representation of two models of stately homes from the 17th century. The surnames of its inhabitants included Vetancourt, Riverol, Merino, Falcón, Aríñez and Bilbao. The house that closes the alley barracks was started in the 17th century. Its facade presents the characteristic typology of manor houses of Gran Canaria, in which a stone frame joins the main door with a window located, with windowsill and cornice as decoration. It typically has four drainpipes. The front of the house is covered with a four-sided roof, while a wide gallery balustrade supported by jabalcones is visible from the Las Huertas area. This building has testimonial value to a past mode of construction, but it is abandoned. The quarry frame has been painted the same color as the cloth of the facade, an aesthetic decision that doesn't reflect traditional construction. In addition, in 2019 a bank of contemporary architectural style was built in front of the house, which contributes to the loss of the place's cultural context.  Marqués del Muni street house  This house gives Casa Condal the nickname to the whole. When cornering, the typological contrast between the secondary facade facing the west (with a wide wall whose only decoration is two rows of windows and the frontis that obeys the neoclassical taste of the openings perfectly arranged in their placement, as well as in the stonework frames that surround them and the elegant cornice that crowns the building on its side of the old street of La Cruz. A striking forged blacksmith shop, with classic vegetal and faunal decoration, is located in the railings of its six windows and on the balcony. Like the previous house, it is in deteriorated condition. E.g., the wide balcony has completely disappeared.  Gallery  File:Casa del Conde.png Casa del Conde in 1980.

It is even suspected that the figures of Christ, John and Mary were made by the master himself. The chapel in which the triumphal cross is located is the oldest preserved in Leuven, with various but unconfirmed attributions concerning authorship - it has already been attributed to Matthijs de Layens, Jan II Borreman, Jan de Messemaker, Hendrik van Evergem, ...  Description  The figures on the Calvary (the triumphal cross) are very realistic. The balance of expressiveness in draping and nuance in the posture of the figures also leads to the suspicion that it was made by Jan Borman, a well-known and appreciated image cutter. Jesus hangs centrally on the cross. He is howled by John and Mary; their images are attached to the tracery of the cross. Mary turns her face away from the cross, as if she can no longer tolerate the view, but John cannot keep his eyes off it. The two images thus symbolize an important characteristic of late-medieval devotion: the practice of \\"pity- piety\\".Debaene, Marjan (red.). Borman. A Family of Northern Renaissance Sculptors.

A common version of the Phra Ruang legend is that he was a Thai chieftain of Lavo (Lopburi) with supernatural powers of speech. The Thais had to deliver water to the Khom (Khmer) capital as tax, and Phra Ruang used his powers to make bamboo baskets waterproof so that they could be used to carry the water instead of heavy clay jars. When the Khom king wanted him dead, Phra Ruang escaped and ordained as a monk at Sukhothai. A Khom spy, \\"diving underground\\", was sent to find him, but not knowing Phra Ruang's face, inadvertently asked him when they met. Phra Ruang told the spy to stay there, and his powers turned him into stone. There have been many modern adaptations of the legend.

The poem is a satirical epic telling of an intergenerational conflict between the corrupt hogs (porci in Latin), who are hogging all the privileges, and the piglets (porcelli), who want in on them. Their conflict devolves into open war, and the poet uses pigs to allegorize human corruption, conflict, and revolutionary violence in a simple and transparent way. > Paraclesis pro Potore > Perlege porcorum pulcherrima proelia, Potor, > Potando poteris placidam proferre poesin.

The stolen items include the 49-carat Dresden White Diamond, the diamond-laden breast star of the Polish Order of the White Eagle which belonged to the King of Poland, a hat clasp with a 16-carat diamond, a diamond epaulette, and a diamond-studded hilt containing nine large and 770 smaller diamonds, along with a matching scabbard. The missing items were of great cultural value to the State of Saxony and were described as priceless; other sources estimate the total value at about €1 billion.  Museum  Jewel Room (labelled 8) within the Green Vault The heist took place at the Green Vault () in Dresden, Germany, one of the oldest museums in Europe, founded in 1723 by Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. At the time of the heist, it displayed about 4,000 items of jewellery and other treasures which were decorated with gold, silver, ivory, pearl, and other precious metals and stones. One of the museum's main treasures, the 41-carat Dresden Green Diamond, was away on loan at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Heist On 25 November at 4 a.m. a small fire was started on the nearby Augustus Bridge, which destroyed a power box. The resulting power outage disabled streetlights and security alarms, but CCTV continued to function. The thieves then cut through iron bars around a window to break into the museum's Jewel Room. According to police, the thieves must have been very small in order to fit through the hole. CCTV footage shows two thieves within the vaults. They smashed the glass displays with an axe in order to gain access to the jewellery. The thieves removed three 18th-century jewellery sets consisting of 37 parts each, including diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. The thieves were not able to take all of the pieces from the three jewellery sets; some jewellery was sewn into the surface of the cabinet and those pieces remained. However, they also took the Dresden White Diamond worth €9–10 million. The thieves exited through the same window, replacing the bars in order to delay detection. The robbery was detected by the guards at 04:56 a.m. and 16 police cars were dispatched to the museum. Security guards stationed at the museum followed protocol after the heist was discovered and did not engage with the robbers, as the guards were unarmed. They instead notified police and followed safety protocol.  Stolen items  Diamond star of the Order of the White Eagle One of the stolen pieces was a small sword, described as an épée made of silver and gold with a hilt of nine large and seven hundred and seventy smaller diamonds. Another was a brooch- style jewel worn by Queen Amalie Auguste which featured at least six hundred and sixty gemstones. Police identified that a jewelled Polish White Eagle Order and a diamond epaulette were among the items stolen. Also believed to be stolen is a diamond hat clasp comprising 15 large diamonds and more than 100 small ones, the largest being a 16-carat diamond, that was made in the 1780s and worn by Frederick Augustus III. An Order of the White Eagle breast star by the diamond-cutter Jean Jacques Pallard, made up of a 20-carat diamond at its centre and a Maltese cross of red rubies, was also taken.  Estimated value  The estimated total value of stolen items, according to Bild, is more than €1 billion (US$1.1 billion) which would make it the largest museum heist in history, surpassing the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft. According to NPR, the \\"material value seems to have fallen short of $1 billion\\". Marion Ackermann, director of Dresden State Art Collections, said that it was impossible to estimate the price of the stolen items due to their historic cultural value. Saxony's interior minister, , also stated that the cultural loss \\"is impossible to estimate\\". Investigation The first police car was called to the building at 4:59 a.m. arriving five minutes later, but by that time the suspects had escaped. The police set up roadblocks on approach around Dresden in an attempt to prevent the suspects from leaving. However, according to police, the museum's close proximity to the autobahn is likely to have helped the suspects' escape. The police believe there were four thieves and that they fled in an Audi A6; an identical vehicle was later found on fire in an underground parking lot. Police offered a €500,000 reward for information which could lead to the capture of the perpetrators. Starting 12 December 2019, several German media outlets reported that police were investigating links to an Arab clan in Berlin. In March 2020, police revealed that at least 7 individuals were involved in the robbery. German prosecutors are currently investigating four security guards as likely culprits, as they failed to \\"react adequately\\". In January 2020, an Israeli security company claimed that jewels from the heist were being sold on the dark web, a claim which German investigators rejected.  Response  It is feared that the thieves will alter the stolen works in order to sell them on the black market. Museum officials have begged the thieves not to melt down any of the gold or otherwise harm the artefacts. The General Director of Dresden's state art collections told reporters that the stolen jewels cannot be sold on the art market legally as they were too well known to collectors. The state police of Saxony have thus far not named any suspects. According to police spokesman Marco Laske, \\"we have not identified a perpetrator and nor have we yet made any arrests.\\" Saxony's Minister-President Michael Kretschmer used Twitter to denounce the crime, saying \\"not only the state art collections were robbed, but we Saxons.\\" The museum reopened on 27 November, although the Green Vault remained closed.

King and Robert B. Clark, who wanted to establish an organization similar to the highly successful Protestant Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions that John Mott had founded. The first meeting took place in 1918 at Techny, outside Chicago, Illinois, with over 100 clergy, seminarians, laity and a few bishops attending. The organization grew quickly under the leadership of Frank A. Thill, its national director who later became Bishop of Salinas, Kansas in 1938. Thill edited the organization's national magazine, The Shield, and traveled the country challenging students to imitate the zeal and dedication of the medieval Crusaders for their faith. Two parallel themes permeated the organization: imagery surrounding the medieval crusaders and the promotion of missions at home and abroad. By the 1930s, the CSMC had enrolled a half-million members. In the next decade, it began compiling U.S. Catholic missionary statistics and in the 1950s it drew on the experience and knowledge of member mission societies to produce Fundamentals of Missiology and Perspectives in Religion and Culture. Other books in the 1960s drew attention of U.S. Catholics to the church and cultures in Africa and Asia. At biennial national conventions, except during World War II, several thousand youth and adult leaders rallied for a summer conference, where they listened to talks by missionaries, walked through large-as-life mission displays, and took part in liturgical services aimed at inspiring young people to read, support missionaries in prayer and to consider a mission vocation themselves. Locally the CSMC was conducted in school units on the junior and senior high school level, as well as in colleges and seminaries. The units used the many audio- visual resources produced by the national office in Cincinnati, Ohio, and attempted to infuse a mission spirit throughout the schools. \\"Round Table\\" discussions, talks by returned missionaries, prayer, song and mission kits provided information and formation about missions at home and abroad. For half a century, the Catholic Student Mission Crusade became one of the most effective and pervasive mission education and promotion programs. The CSMC closed its national doors in 1972. New understandings of mission which surfaced at the Second Vatican Council, the demise of crusade themes and medieval imagery, and a plethora of liturgical and catechetical developments following the Council, and social and political issues of the 1970s directed the attention of U.S. Catholic youth elsewhere.\\" References Sources * * * Category:Catholic youth organizations Category:Christian organizations established in 1918 ","title":"Catholic Students' Mission Crusade"},{"id":"62429372","text":"The Noshima Murakami were a Japanese family, involved in seafaring and piracy during the 16th century. The family was based on Noshima, a small island off the coast of Shikoku in the Seto Inland Sea. Ōuchi clan In 1532, the Noshima began working for the Ōtomo clan and the Kōno family, who were fighting against Ōuchi Yoshitaka. They attacked Ōuchi sea lords in the Kamagari Islands. In the summer of 1541, Ōuchi's Shirai sea lords led an attack against the Noshima, Kurushima, and Innoshima, reaching a standstill in the winter months. The next year, the Noshima began to conduct cargo inspections at Itsukushima under a contract with Ōuchi Yoshitaka. This led the Kōno family to stop their patronage. Merchants from Sakai brought a suit against them alleging an infringement of their rights to levy duties. A countersuit was brought by the Noshima, and the merchants acknowledged their toll rights on all ships apart from those coming from south Kyushu. In the 1540s, a minor branch of the family based on the nearby Nakatoshima island launched a challenge over house leadership. Ōuchi sponsorship and assistance from the Shirai allowed the main branch to subdue them easily. Oda clan In 1576, the Noshima helped break the Oda clan blockade and deliver provisions to Osaka's citadel. They proceeded to capture a castle near Utazu, which allowed them to control the harbour. From 1579 until 1582, they worked for the Mori clan to block the Inland Sea from any of Oda Nobunaga's ships. However, they later entered into negotiations with the Oda, sending Nobunaga a baby hawk, which was a symbol of loyal service. Traveller asssitance In the 1520s, the Hosokawa recognized Noshima control over Shiwaku, where they developed it into a way station for travellers and sailors. The Nosima were generous in the travel passes that they gave, bestowing them to Matsura lords from Hirado Domain, harbour officials from Akamagaseki, shipping organizations from Kii Province, and traveling Jesuits. In 1586, Portuguese missionary Luís Fróis, expressed his fear of travelling through the Inland Sea without flying the Noshima flag. The Noshima leader at the time was Murakami Takeyoshi, and flying their flag was often seen as the only way to ensure safety at sea. The Noshima created a maritime toll road using ships: the protection against interlopers and rival companies possibly persuaded merchants to remain within the boundaries.

Overview  Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as Greeks, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Roma and Aromanians) have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country's population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation was as follows: Albanians 2,312,356 (82.6% of the total), Greeks 24,243 (0.9%), Macedonians 5,512 (0.2%), Montenegrins 366 (0.01%), Aromanians 8,266 (0.30%), Romani 8,301 (0.3%), Balkan Egyptians 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%). On the quality of the specific data the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities stated that \\"the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities.\\". Albania recognizes nine national or cultural minorities: Greek, Macedonian, Wallachian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma, Egyptian, Bosnian and Bulgarian peoples. Other Albanian minorities are Gorani, Aromanians and Jews. Regarding the Greeks, \\"it is difficult to know how many Greeks there are in Albania\\". The estimates vary between 60,000 and 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania. According to Ian Jeffries, most of Western sources put the number at around 200,000. The 300,000 mark is supported by Greek government as well. The CIA World Factbook estimates the Greek minority at 0.9% of the total population. The US State Department uses 1.17% for Greeks and 0.23% for other minorities. The latter questions the validity of the census data about the Greek minority, due to the fact that measurements have been affected by boycott. Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate. This is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring Albanian ethnicity, according to them the Albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity. Genc Pollo, the minister in charge has declared that: \\"Albanian citizens will be able to freely express their ethnic and religious affiliation and mother tongue. However, they are not forced to answer these sensitive questions\\". The amendments criticized do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion; only a fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court. Greek representatives form part of the Albanian parliament and the government has invited Albanian Greeks to register, as the only way to improve their status. On the other hand, nationalists, various organizations and political parties in Albania have expressed their concern that the census might artificially increase the numbers of the Greek minority, which might be then exploited by Greece to threaten Albania's territorial integrity.

She was one of the first women to run for political office in Newfoundland.  Life  Julia Salter was born September 20, 1878 in St. John's, Newfoundland, the twelfth child of Elizabeth Brown Chancey and William Thomas Hall Salter. She attended Methodist College in St. John's. In 1903 she married Arthur Edward Earle, a St. John's jeweller and together they had six children. Salter Earle worked in paid employment as an engrossing clerk for the Newfoundland Legislative Assembly, preparing in script writing every law passed by the legislature. Her paid work gave Salter Earle a wide knowledge of the laws in Newfoundland, and supported her efforts with labour unions, in politics and community organizations. People often called upon her to settle disputes involving the law or a hardship they were enduring.  Social activism and politics  Salter Earle was a community activist, fighting for worker’s rights and against poverty and unemployment. In August 1918, the Ladies Branch of the Newfoundland Industrial Workers Association was formed, with Julia Salter Earle as President. This union represented women workers in clothing, cordage and shoe factories, among others, who were seeking better working conditions and wages, issues that had been ignored in Newfoundland. Salter Earle met with factory managers and owners to resolve factory floor issues and employee dismissals. She wrote letters to the newspaper raising concerns over poor wages and the use of child labour in factories. Salter Earle also led representations to government on behalf of the unemployed. On 21 April, 1921, Salter Earle and Edward J. Whitty, executive member of the Newfoundland Industrial Workers Association (NIWA), led a march of unemployed workers through downtown St. John's to the House of Assembly. There they presented a petition seeking government action to provide relief for the unemployed. A second march on 13 May 1921 challenged the promises of relief made by government; Salter Earle argued their efforts were not sufficient to address the plight of unemployed women and men. In 1925, Salter Earle ran for a council seat as a local labour candidate in the St. John’s municipal election, the first election in which women were eligible to stand for election in Newfoundland. She was one of three women challenging for a seat; the others were May Kennedy and Fannie Knowling McNeil. Salter Earle’s campaign slogan was, “Vote for Julia, She Won’t Fool Ya”. She lost by only eleven votes. In the early 1940s she ran again but did not win a seat. Although not successful in formal politics, Julia Salter Earle remained a strong supporter of those in need, sometimes giving food from her own table to the hungry who came to her door. She carried her concern for others into the Women’s Association of Cochrane Street Methodist Church and the Old Colony Club, previously known as the Ladies Reading Room and Current Events Club, a group of prominent women who focused on the child welfare movement and women’s enfranchisement. Julia Salter Earle died, aged 67, on May 10, 1945. Further reading * The Finest Kind: Voices of Newfoundland and Labrador Women by M.

He programmed his own audio-visual software Versum. In this 3d real-time virtual world, the artist creates audio-visual compositions. Barri has collaborated with Radiohead, Atoms for Peace, Sote, Nicolas Jaar, Monolake and others. Since 2015, he has toured as part of a trio with Thom Yorke and Nigel Godrich in a series of concerts featuring Yorke's Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes project.  Biography  Barri was born in Arnhem, the Netherlands. He has lived in Saudi Arabia from 5 until 10. After returning to the Netherlands he initially studied architecture, switched to psychology, and eventually graduated in Audio Design at the Utrecht School of the Arts, after John Peel played one of his songs on the radio.  Versum  Barri programmed Versum as a tool to create music in 3d. The software is used to build immersive compositions of digital graphics. In 2011, in collaboration with artist Monolake, the software, originally intended to create 3D music, was first used as a purely visual tool to accompany the music. On stage, the visuals are created live, reflecting the skeleton and nuances of sound to and morphing to the music. For example, scenes flicker to a track’s pace, and images pulsate to the beat.  Thom Yorke  Following Barri's video for Judge, Jury and Executioner by Atoms for Peace, Yorke asked Barri to add visuals to their tour (together with Nigel Godrich).https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p062qkg5 In 2018, Barri has collaborated with Thom Yorke on City Rats at the ISM Hexadome at Berlin’s Institute for Sound and Music, a 360-degree audiovisual composition consisting of warped images on six screens with the sound spread over 54 speakers.

His work was especially influential in promoting tourism in Western Canada and the Canadian Rockies and included many images of the Canadian Pacific's flagship streamliner The Canadian. One of Morant's favourite shooting locations is located in the Canadian Rockies East of Lake Louise, Alberta where the CPR mainline parallels the Bow River. This location now bears the geographic placename Morant's Curve in his honour. Accessible from the Bow Valley Parkway, it remains a favourite of photographers. His images were not only used in promotional material for the railway but also were used subsequently in Canadian currency and postage stamps.

Serious injuries from a bear attack in 1939 precluded his enlistment in the military during WWII, but he was \\"loaned\\" to the Canadian Bureau of Public Information as a wartime photographer between 1940 and 1944, during which period he extensively documented the Canadian war effort. An image from this era was engraved for use on a Canadian fifty cent stamp of the time. His photos were also subsequently featured on the backs of Canadian currency. This included the Canadian $10 bill of the 1954 series, featuring of a scene of Emerald Lake and Mount Burgess in Yoho National Park photographed by Morant and engraved by Harry P. Dawson. The $100 Canadian bill of the 1954 series featured an image of Okanagan Lake captured by Morant in 1947 and engraved by William Ford. The final image of Morant's to appear on Canadian currency was an engraving based on a photograph of Moraine Lake in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, which was featured on the $20 bill from the 1969 Scenes of Canada banknote series. As he worked for the majority of his career as a commercial photographer, relatively few of his images appear to be presently in the public domain. However, the Canadian Pacific Railway archives maintains over 12,000 images captured by Morant over the course of his career, and the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies maintains the Nicholas Morant Fonds, which contains over 50,000 photographs by or of Morant, as well as numerous negatives, scrapbooks, and sound recordings.

Written and produced by Mark Cutforth, the film serves as both as a horror film and a parody of the slasher genre, and the Friday the 13th film series in particular. It stars Gregory Cox as Jackson, a hockey mask-wearing serial killer who develops a romance with a blind woman named Shelly (played by Fiona Evans) and grows weary of his murderous ways. The film's cast also includes Edward Brayshaw as Jackson's father. Unmasked Part 25 was shot on location in London, England and was released direct-to-video. In 2019, the film was restored and released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome. Plot In London, couple Pete and Ann are walking to a flat party when a stranger warns them not to enter the residence where the party is being held, claiming that an evil child was born there and that he has returned from a distant place in search of revenge. They ignore his warning and join their friends Patti, Mick, Monica and Shelly in the flat. Outside the party, Patti's date Albert is murdered by an assailant wearing a hockey goalie mask. Inside, Pete and Ann venture down into an unkempt room. The masked killer beats Pete to death with a shovel and fatally garrotes Ann. Mick and Monica go upstairs to have sex, and the killer impales them with a spear. The killer then murders Patti with a light fixture before dancing with her corpse while smoking a cigarette. The killer walks downstairs, where he finds Shelly. She is blind, and believes that Patti set him up with her as her date. She brings him to her home, where he reveals that he can speak. The killer, whose name is Jackson and whose face is disfigured, says that he has never had anyone to talk to, and that people see him as a monster. Shelly and Jackson share a kiss and have sex. Jackson tells her that he was abused by his alcoholic father, and that Jackson and his mother moved to the United States when Jackson was young. Jackson was thought to have drowned at a camp one summer, but he had survived. Jackson returns to the unkempt room in the house where he was born. His drunken father is there, and Jackson tells him about his feelings for Shelly, and that he does not want to kill any more people. His father, who was himself a murderer, berates and dismisses him. Later, Jackson and Shelly visit a Halloween mask store. Due to the goalie mask he wears, Shelly compares Jackson to a character in a film called The Hand of Death. Jackson, frustrated, replies, \\"don't you understand? I am that guy from the movies!\\" Shelly purchases a goalie mask of her own and the two go for a walk together. One night, Jackson follows Shelly's friend Christi into a pub. Inside, patrons Nick, Mac and Barry believe Jackson to be an actor in the middle of a film production. When Jackson refuses to speak, Nick tries to remove his mask, and Jackson stabs him before fleeing the scene. Jackson returns home and kills his father by crushing his head. Later, Jackson and Shelly unsuccessfully attempt to engage in a BDSM session. Elsewhere, Christi, Mac and Barry bring Nick to a house, where they intend for Nick to recover from his stab wound. On Friday the 13th, Jackson heads on foot to the house where Nick, Christi, Mac and Barry are staying. Mac strays into a nearby wooded area with a woman named Charlotte. Jackson confronts Charlotte, laments the dullness of his murder sprees, and advises her against running away since she will inevitably stumble and fall. As predicted, she falls while trying to flee, and he kills her with a pitchfork. Nick then wanders outside and is also killed by Jackson. Jackson enters the house, where he murders Barry with an axe and drives a cleaver into the face of Barry's partner Meagan. Jackson then pursues Christi, corners her in a shower and kills her. He later visits Shelly and attempts to break up with her, and she tells him that she is pregnant. Begging for her forgiveness, he slits her throat. He leaves and walks down the city streets, before falling to his knees in anguish when he sees a cinema marquee that reads The Hand of Death Part 26: Jackson Returns.

Since 2016 he has also appeared under the name of K. Ronaldo as a fictitious older brother of himself, with the K. standing either for Kristallo or for Kristus. He is part of the Berlin-based artist collective Live From Earth. He released his album \\"Y\\" on November 8, 2019.  Life  Yung Hurn originates from the Viennese district Hirschstetten in the 22nd district Donaustadt. In his youth (up to U15) he played football for SV Hirschstetten. In 2014, the high school graduate got to know the Viennese rapper Rap4Fikk and shortly thereafter began rapping himself. Together with the Producer Lex Lugner Yung Hurn recorded the EP Wiener Linien in 2015. In July, he released his debut Mixtape 22, whose track Nein was voted one of the top 10 best national music tracks of the year by readers of the German hip-hop magazine Juice. 2016 followed the Krocha Tape and under the name K. Ronaldo the mixtape I Wanted to Kill Myself but Today is my Mothers Birthday. Furthermore, Yung Hurn released together with the German rapper RIN the independent single Bianco. This was intended for the joint album Mafia der Liebe, the release of which is uncertain after RIN's retirement, and was voted single of the year in the Juice annual charts. Yung Hurn with fans at Rock im Park in Nürnberg (2018) On December 23, 2016, the compilation In Memory of Yung Hurn – Classic Compilation was released, the first release of which could only be purchased digitally and streamed on popular portals. The album also received a limited vinyl edition in June 2017. In 2015, Yung Hurn had declared that his music would always be available for free download. In 2017, the EP Love Hotel and the two Singles Popo and Ok Cool were released. In June of the same year, Yung Hurn announced via Twitter that he no longer wanted to do rap after 2017. In December 2017, at the same time as releasing the single \\"GGGut\\", he announced that he wanted to release a first album with the title 1220 in spring 2018, which was officially released on 4 May 2018 and DJ Stickle. Yung Hurn - GGGut (Official Video) (prod. Stickle) at youtube.com; uploaded at December, 22 2017; Retrieved November 25, 2019. With the release of the single \\"Cabrio\\", shortly before his appearance at the Donauinselfest 2019, he announced a new album Y for the same year. He also announced in an interview with the radio station FM4 that he was working on an album with the Love Hotel Band.  Style and influence  Yung Hurn's early music was soon assigned by journalists to the cloud rap that was started in the United States at the end of the 2000s. In fact, in his first tracks, according to his own statements, he was inspired not only by the Horrorcore representatives and hip hop pioneers Three 6 Mafia, but also by the Californian rapper Lil B, who is often referred to as the founder of cloud rap. In a show of the music magazine Tracks by the TV station Arte about him and the Cologne cloud rapper LGoony, Yung Hurn also said regarding his musical influences that he listens to indie as well as \\"deep dirty techno\\" and psychedelic rock. Thus, Tame Impala or Falco, but especially the Beatles, had strongly influenced him. He can also be seen on the show with a record by Jimi Hendrix. Yung Hurn took a path away from pure hip-hop with the Love Hotel-EP, which had been produced by DJ Stickle and announced in the context of the video premiere of the associated R&B; track Rot. On Valentine's Day the second track Diamant was released, a retro pop song atypical for Yung Hurn without any rap interludes. The video in the style of the 80s shows the song interpreted by the Love Hotel Band, which includes Yung Hurn and the Berlin actor Lars Eidinger. The band now also performs live.

An independent investigation into the allegations was announced in April 2018, conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie; the report, released in May 2019, concluded that Dr. Strauss abused at least 177 male student-patients and that OSU was aware of the abuse as early as 1979, but the abuse was not widely known outside of Athletics or Student Health until 1996, when he was suspended from his duties. Strauss continued to abuse OSU students at an off-campus clinic until his retirement from the university in 1998. OSU was faulted in the report for failing to report Strauss's conduct to law enforcement. In May 2020, the university entered into a settled and agreed to pay $40.9 million to the sexual abuse survivors. Background Dr. Richard Strauss (1938-2005) received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1964 and interned at the associated hospital system until June 1965. Afterward, he served as a Lieutenant in the Medical Corps of the United States Navy from 1966 through 1968 and received an honorable discharge. He then took a two-year post-doctoral fellowship at the School of Medicine at the University of Washington until 1970, then worked as an assistant professor of physiology at both the University of Pennsylvania (1970–72) and the University of Hawaii (1972–74). After Hawaii, Strauss worked as a medical resident at Rutgers University (1974–75) and as a research fellow at Harvard Medical School (1975–78). Hawaii found no records of any complaints filed against Strauss during his time there. Strauss was hired as an Assistant Professor in the OSU College of Medicine in September 1978; shortly afterward, he began volunteering as a team physician at Larkins Hall, OSU's physical education building. He was appointed to a position in the Athletics Department in 1981, and to Student Health in 1994. In Athletics, Strauss served as a team physician for multiple teams, including men's swimming/diving, wrestling, gymnastics, fencing, and lacrosse; he additionally treated students on the hockey, cheerleading, volleyball, soccer, track, golf, baseball, tennis, water polo, and football teams. Strauss was not formally appointed to a position at Student Health until 1994, but was known to have started performing treatments there as early as 1978. By 1979, Athletics Department officials knew that Strauss conducted unusually prolonged genital examinations on male athletes, and that athletics staff were not permitted to be present during these examinations. In addition, Strauss was known to shower alongside male students at Larkins Hall, a behavior which was unique among team physicians to Strauss. Between 1979 and 1996, multiple students complained about Strauss's excessive and unnecessary genital examinations, but no action was taken by OSU until January 1996, when he was placed on administrative leave in response to patient complaints. Larkins Hall, which served OSU as its Physical Education facility and Natatorium, was perceived as a sexualized environment, and multiple witnesses reported that voyeurism and public sex acts occurred there from the early 1980s to the late 1990s. 30 wrestlers and gymnasts reported voyeurs were routinely present at Larkins Hall in the locker room, shower, and sauna areas, ranging from college age to approximately 60 years old; the \\"leering\\" voyeurs would ogle student-athletes that were using the facilities and some would masturbate. Strauss was counted among the voyeurs; former OSU students stated that Strauss would shower among athletes multiple times per day or stare into the shower while seated on a stool. In addition, peepholes were found in bathroom stalls and shower walls. The building was completed in 1932, named for retired OSU Athletic Director Dick Larkins in 1976, expanded in 1977, and demolished in 2005. After a closed-door hearing on June 5, 1996, Strauss was terminated from his position with the Athletics Department at the end of July 1996, and terminated from Student Health on August 5, 1996. However, Strauss opened a private off-campus clinic and continued to abuse male patients there. Former employees of the off-campus \\"Men's Clinics of America\\" recalled that Strauss placed advertisements in the student newspaper promising student discounts and prompt treatment of genital issues. He also continued as a tenured faculty member in the School of Public Health until his voluntary retirement on March 1, 1998, upon which he gained emeritus status. Strauss committed suicide in August 2005. According to his suicide note, he had been suffering from \\"significant escalating medical and pain problems since January 2002\\". In 2019, OSU published its annual campus safety report, which reflected that Strauss committed 1,430 instances of fondling and 47 rapes during his tenure. Investigation Mike DiSabato was one of the first to report that Strauss had groped him during medical exams. He first requested information about Strauss in January 2018 via a letter to the university; after failing to get a timely response, he approached The Columbus Dispatch with the allegations of abuse in April. DiSabato, who wrestled at Ohio State from 1987 to 1991, added that his first examination with Strauss occurred at the age of 14, when Strauss was conducting research on the body fat of high school wrestlers; the body fat testing included an unnecessary genital exam. At the time, DiSabato did not recognize Strauss's behavior as sexual abuse and that it was considered an \\"open secret\\" amongst the wrestling team. In response, the Ohio State University announced that an investigation had been launched into the long-term sexual abuse in April 2018, asking former students and coaches to come forward with any information that might help the investigation. At the time, the independent investigation was being led by Bricker & Eckler. After the Ohio Attorney General's office appointed Porter Wright Morris & Arthur as the university's legal counsel, Porter Wright commissioned Perkins Coie to lead the independent investigation. OSU President Michael Drake sent an email in May 2018 to more than 100,000 alumni asking them to contact Perkins Coie with any allegations of abuse. Based on the evidence uncovered, in June 2018 Perkins Coie expanded the scope of the investigation to include Strauss's examinations of high school students. The investigation was estimated to have cost $6.2 million by the time the report was released in May 2019. Strauss's son, Scott Strauss, released a statement in July 2018 expressing the Strauss family was \\"shocked and saddened\\" by the allegations against Dr. Strauss. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the United States Department of Education announced it had opened a separate investigation into the university's response in August 2018. Several advocacy groups had sent a letter to OCR earlier in August, alleging that OSU's actions violated Title IX regulations. The Ohio State Medical Board confirmed that it had received complaints about Strauss and had turned over confidential records to OSU lawyers in December 2018. However, because the records were confidential, the investigators were not allowed to access them. The State Medical Board had investigated Strauss in 1996 but never disciplined him. Details of the investigation were made public in the report by Perkins Coie; specific identifying details were redacted. In May 2019, after the redacted report was released, the State Medical Board voted to release the records of its 1996 investigation if the alleged victims agreed to waive their confidentiality. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine created a review group via executive order in May 2019. The group's charter was to review the actions that were taken by the State Medical Board in response to the complaints about Dr. Strauss. The investigators conducted interviews with 177 students who provided evidence that Strauss had committed sexual abuse; although not all of the students felt his behavior was abusive, consultation with independent medical doctors confirmed they were not appropriate patient-doctor interactions. The majority of abuse (143 victims) was categorized as genital fondling associated with medically unnecessary genital or rectal examinations. Of the 177, 153 were student-athletes, of which a plurality (48) were members of the men's wrestling team. Civil lawsuits and subsequent developments Several civil lawsuits have been filed against The Ohio State University in conjunction with the abuse committed by Dr. Strauss. Three federal lawsuits had been filed by July 2018; the third lawsuit named several OSU administrators including ex-Athletic Director Andy Geiger as having knowledge of Strauss's abuse. By September 2018, the university had filed motions to dismiss the first three lawsuits based on associated statutes of limitations. Two of the suits were merged in October 2018. In total, more than 20 school officials and staff were named as knowing complaints about Strauss's abuse but failing to stop him. In July 2018, former members of the OSU men's wrestling team reported that then-coaches Russ Hellickson (head coach, 1986–2006) and Jim Jordan (assistant coach, 1987–95) were aware of the abuse by Strauss. Jordan denied that any student-athlete had reported any abuse to him. Jordan said the timing of the allegations that he knew of the abuse were \\"interesting ... in light of things that are going on in Washington\\", referring to Jordan's role as a founder of the Freedom Caucus and his potential candidacy for Speaker of the House. Speaker Paul Ryan defended Jordan as \\"a man of honesty, a man of integrity\\" and discouraged an investigation by the House Ethics Committee, as the abuse had occurred before Jordan's election to the House of Representatives. Other ex-wrestlers defended Jordan, who was interviewed by Perkins Coie later in July. In May 2019, DiSabato filed a Title IX lawsuit against OSU. In one count of the court papers, DiSabato claimed that a second cousin of Jordan's attempted to \\"intimidate and retaliate\\" against DiSabato. In 2019, DiSabato shared text messages with NBC News that were corroborated by another former wrestler indicating that Jim Jordan, Russ Hellickson, and high school wrestling coach Jeff Jordan (Jim Jordan's younger brother) conspired to engage in witness tampering and intimidation when they called former OSU wrestler Mark Coleman and his parents to pressure him to recant his earlier accusation that Jordan was aware of the abuse. Coleman had shared a room with Jordan while traveling to several wrestling meets. In November 2019, a retired wrestling referee filed a lawsuit alleging that he had warned Jordan and Hellickson about Strauss' misconduct. Jordan promptly dismissed the referee as \\"another person making a false statement\\". In February 2020, Adam DiSabato-- the brother of Mike DiSabato--testified under oath that Jordan called him \\"'crying, groveling...begging me to go against my brother.... That's the kind of cover-up that's going on there'\\". In the videotaped deposition, Adam DiSabato stated under oath: \\"[Jordan] is throwing us all under the bus, he is a coward. A coward. He is not a leader, he's a coward... I was Captain of our team, I would never abandon our Team. He abandoned us; our Head Coach (Russ Hellickson) abandoned us - [Hellickson] has flipped his story and called other people to flip their stories.\\" 2020 settlement Following an independent 2019 investigation which found that Richard Strauss had sexually abused at least 177 students during 1979 to 1997; Ohio State University agreed to pay $40.9 million to settle the lawsuits of 162 men who alleged sexual abuse during former university team doctor's tenure. Other lawsuits remain outstanding.

On February 1, 2017, a Ukrainian Navy An-26 transport aircraft came under small arms fire from Russian military personnel, stationed on a drill rig, while flying over the Odesa gas field in the Black Sea. This gas field is located within Ukraine's exclusive economic zone, not off the Crimean peninsula, which is also part of Ukraine's EEZ. While the rig in question has not been named, it was amongst those stolen by Russian forces in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea. According to the Ukrainian military, the plane was on a training flight and was hit by small caliber shells.  2018  On 21 September 2018, the Russian Su-27 fighter, from the temporarily occupied territory of the Crimea, created the preconditions for an emergency in the air, approaching to a dangerous distance an An-26 military transport aircraft of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, which was executing a scheduled task above the Black Sea.

On July 24, Russia blocked off 120 thousand square kilometers—nearly 25 percent of the entire Black Sea surface. On 10 July 2019, despite a coastal notification for seafarers regarding the closure of the area for conducting the international exercise Sea Breeze 2019, the Smetlivy, a ship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, entered at about 08:00 on July 10, 2019 an area closed to navigation, where practical naval artillery shooting was conducted by a naval group of an international coalition, and provoked a dangerous situation. In the August 2019, Ukrainian Navy small reconnaissance ship Pereyaslav during their trip to Georgia to participate in exercise Agile Spirit 2019 and while in neutral waters, crew received a warning over the radio from a Russian navy ship. The Russians warned that the Ukrainians needed to turn away because the area was allegedly blocked. International coordinators did not confirm that fact, so the captain of the Pereyaslav decided to maintain the vessel along its original course. Soon thereafter, the Kasimov, a large Russian anti-submarine corvette, Project 1124M/Grisha V-class, was spotted near the Ukrainian ship. The Russian corvette's aggressive behavior only ceased when a Turkish reconnaissance plane arrived close to the Pereyaslav. This provocation was filmed by a Ukrainian team of military journalists as part of the Ukrainian delegation participating in Agile Spirit 2019. On 14 November 2019, during the Third International Conference for Maritime Security, in Odesa, Ukrainian Navy commander Admiral Ihor Voronchenko said that a Russian Tu-22M3 had been observed simulating the launch of a missile strike on this coastal city, Voronchenko added that Russian bombers had made several similar attempts during exercises on July 10, conducting a virtual airstrike 60 kilometers from Odesa.

He joined Software AG in Darmstadt in 1971 as one of 6 employees and in 1975 became Vice President of Software AG. Page developed NATURAL as the first fourth-generation programming language, which was instrumental in Software AG's success.  Life  After graduating from a gymnasium in Wiesbaden and studying electrical engineering at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Pagé worked from 1966 to 1970 as a hardware developer for process computers at AEG in Seligenstadt, where he as project manager was responsible for the development and introduction of process computer systems, including the AEG 60-10 system. In 1971, Pagé joined the Institute for Applied Information Processing (AIV), from which Software AG later emerged. From 1975, together with Margit Neumann, he developed the innovative software development environment Natural as the first fourth-generation programming language. NATURAL revolutionized the creation of applications on mainframe computers with a completely interactive way of working. This has resulted in significant increases in productivity and shorter implementation times for application solutions. From 1977 Pagé as a member of the Vorstand, executive board, was responsible for marketing and sales as well as product development, where he largely built up the current product portfolio and adapted it to new market requirements in several cycles over many years. In 1990, he designed and implemented Entire Function Server Architecture (ENTIRE), the first service- oriented architecture (SOA). Pagé left the company in 1992 after differences with Peter Schnell over Software AG's future strategy when the company had about 4.500 employees worldwide. In the following year, he received his doctorate from TU Berlin. The title of his PhD thesis was \\"Object-Oriented Software in Commercial Applications\\". In 1994, Pagé joined Siemens Nixdorf AG as a member of the executive board and chief technology officer responsible for systems strategy and application software. In this function, he gave the company the \\"User Centered Computing\\"-architecture, which was in principle a service-oriented architecture (SOA), and reorganized their highly fragmented software offering.

Early life  Yacine was born on 14 November 1949, in Boudjellil, in the wilaya Bejaia. Her mother was a housewife and her father an immigrant who was tortured and executed in 1956. She completed her primary, secondary and higher studies in Algeria, where she also worked before leaving for France in 1987. Career Yacine is Director of Study at l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and is also a member of the department of social anthropology at the Collège de France. She directs Awal (\\"The word\\") - a journal founded in 1985 in Paris with the Algerian anthropologist Mouloud Mammeri and the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to explore Berber life. Yacine's doctoral thesis was entitled Productions culturelles et agents de production en kabylie: anthropologie de la culture dans les groupes kabyles 16e-20e siecle, which she was awarded a PhD for in 1992 from Paris-Sorbonne University. Her first degree was in Spanish at the University of Algiers; she graduated for it in 1980.  Research  Yacine has written widely on Berber anthropology Her approach to social anthropology combines scientific assessment with oral literature. She is an expert on the work of Bourdieu, placing his experiences in Algeria as a central influence on his philosophy. She edited the diaries of Jean Amrouche, enabling greater understanding of his influence on literature. She led the colloquium following the death of Rabah Belamri, which re-examined, as well as playing tribute to, his role in literary culture in the Maghreb. She edited a collection of Bourdieu's writings, where Yacine placed his work in its Algerian political contexts. She is an expert on the life of Berber peoples and has published and spoken widely on the subject, especially how Arabic culture and language has eroded Amazigh identities over the course of the twentieth century. Yacine has studied kabyle language and Berber literary cultures in particular. She is also an authority on how gender intersects with the erosion of cultural identities in Amazigh culture, using a Freudian framework for cultural analysis. This work was built on in a subsequent thesis by Terhi Lehtinen. Two of her most significant academic works are seen to be: Chacal ou la ruse des dominés (2001) and Si tu m'aimes, guéris-moi (2006). In the latter book, Yacine places Berber culture in its wider Mediterranean context, as well as transcending the traditional distinction between oral and written cultures.Tassadit Yacine (21e Maghreb des Livres, Paris, 7 et 8 février 2015)  Monographs  * 1987 - L'izli ou l'amour chanté en kabyle, Préface de Pierre Bourdieu, Paris, MSH - (). * 1989 - Aït Menguellet chante...

She uses spectacular entertainment forms, including fairground devices and stage illusion, and draws on themes of contemporary ritual, to investigate social issues from an ecofeminist perspective. Time Out declared that Carnesky's 'unique niche of interactive end-of-the-pier esoterica has fused ghost trains, anatomical models and tattoo culture with religion, feminism and class consciousness in ways both playful and rewardingly demanding.''Carnesky's Tarot Drome', Time Out, 10 September 2012 Carnesky has won many awards, including the Laurence Olivier for Best Entertainment in 2004, Edinburgh Festival Herald Angel in 2005 and Time Out Best Theatre in 2004.Marisa Carnesky page at the University of Sheffield's National Fairground and Circus Archive Training Carnesky studied ballet at London's West Street Ballet School (1987-8) followed by two years of a degree in Dance and Choreography at the Laban Dance Centre (1988–90). The Laban teachers told her that what she was doing 'was more performance art'.'Performance maker Marisa Carnesky: ‘When faced with something I can’t solve, I make a show about it’ Giverny Masso, interview with Carnesky in The Stage, 30 October 2018 This led her, in 1990–3, to the University of Brighton, where she completed a Visual and Performing Arts degree taught by the choreographer Liz Aggiss. Aggiss recruited Carnesky into her company, Divas, which led to her first professional role, performing in 'Die Orchidee im Plastik Karton' in 1992. Alternative burlesque In the 1990s, Carnesky moved to London where she worked in alternative burlesque. In 1994, she performed in, and was a deviser on, Robert Pacitti's Geek!Pacitti Company archive page on Geek! Her 1990s solo performances included the commission for Lady Muck and Her Burlesque Revue at the Now Festival Nottingham (1996), the Nine Breasted Woman at the Duckie Prom Night at the ICA (1997) and Mademoiselle Lefort in the St Valentine's Day Pleasure Parade under the Vauxhall Railway Arches (1998).Bruce Bailey, 'The Queer Carnival', University of Exeter PhD thesis, 2000 pp. 114-5 As a director and member of the Dragon Ladies troupe, including the late visual artist Amanda Moss, she co-created The Grotesque Burlesque Revue (1998) staged at Soho's Raymond Revue Bar. This was a surreal version of the Bluebeard story, featuring sailors, tattooed women, snakes, peacocks, and a woman transformed into a ship's mast, weeping 'tears of blood into the ocean'.Bruce Bailey, interview with Carnesky in 'The Queer Carnival', University of Exeter PhD thesis, 2000 p344 Carnesky also spent time in New York, where she posed for the performance artist Annie Sprinkle for her Pleasure Activist Playing Cards, and worked with the spoken word performer Jennifer Blowdryer in her Smut Fest, a live showcase of subversive sexual performance artists. She appeared in HBO's television series Real Sex and the 1998 TV documentary Showgirl Stories From Vaudeville to Vegas, directed by Agnieszka Piotrowska and narrated by Angelica Huston. Jewess Tattooess Carnesky's first full-length solo show, in 2000, was Jewess Tattooess, in which she explored the cultural and religious implications of being a heavily tattooed Jewess, breaking the religion's taboo against body art. It was while researching the work that she 'opted to reclaim the Latvian surname her grandmother had anglicised during the 1940s - Carnesky, fortuitously redolent of both carnival and the carnal.'Judith Palmer, 'Expensive Thrills', the New Statesman, 14 June 2004 Jewess Tattooess included storytelling, fairground illusions, films (by Alison Murray) and a soundtrack by David Knight, Katherine Gifford and James Johnston. The most striking element was the live tattooing of a Star of David and a dragon onto Carnesky's flesh. While planning the piece, she described it as 'a mixture of a play...with a real event, real blood, my whole body on the line in the show. While I'm being tattooed my breath will change, my emotions will change. I'll have a needle in my back and I'll be talking about my fears of being tattooed and being Jewish.'Bruce Bailey, 'The Queer Carnival', University of Exeter PhD thesis, 2000 p348 In Total Theatre, Dorothy Max Prior described Jewess Tattooess as 'a compelling piece of theatre informed by a visual arts sensibility; an expressionist dance merged with storytelling; a vaudeville entertainment that embraces the poetic. But above all a performance that invites the audience to witness the rite of passage from innocent childhood to informed womanhood.'Dorothy Max Prior, 'Jewess Tattoeess' review, Total Theatre, Spring 2001 Jewess Tattooess toured internationally and was staged at Battersea Arts Centre, the ICA, Riverside Studios, Arnolfini, Colchester Arts Centre, CCA Glasgow, Escena Contemporana, Spain; Ireland, Project Arts Centre; Cenpi, Croatia; Cultural Centre Serbia, Theatre Arsenic, Switzerland, Live Art – Kanonhallen, Denmark and the Los Angeles International Festival.List of works on Carnesky's website C'Est Barbican As part of Duckie, the 'post gay'Rupert Smith, 'Join the Club', The Guardian, 14 May 2002 performance collective, Carnesky co-created and starred in C'est Vauxhall in 2002, originally staged at the Vauxhall Tavern, and renamed C'est Barbican when it transferred there during Christmas 2003.Madeleine North, 'Duckies among the Luvvies', The Independent, 21 September 2003 The show won the 2004 Olivier award for Best Entertainment. Renamed C'est Duckie, it subsequently toured to Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Sydney (Opera House), Berlin, Tokyo, Kyoto and New York. The Girl from Nowhere In 2003, Carnesky created The Girl from Nowhere, a collaboration with the magician Paul Kieve and Hilary Westlake, director of the experimental theatre group Lumiere and Son. Using filmed testimony and magic illusions, the piece retold Jewish and eastern European folktales and stories of migration, exploring similarities between migrant journeys from East to West.Girl from Nowhere, archive page on Carnesky's website The show was described by Dorothy Max Prior in Total Theatre as 'an evening of many pleasures perfectly executed.'Dorothy Max Prior, 'Marisa Carnesky, the Girl from Nowhere', Total Theatre, August 2003 Carnesky´s Ghost Train Girl from Nowhere led towards Carnesky's best known and most ambitious work, Carnesky's Ghost Train, in 2004, which also took migrant journeys as its subject. Carnesky told the Telegraph, 'When you go on a ghost train you become displaced. Ghosts and ghost trains are all about being frightened and being disorientated.'Jasper Rees, 'Ghost train that's a work of art', The Telegraph, 2 August 2004 Carnesky's train was a 400-square- metre wide fairground ride, built in a disused car factory in Dagenham. The creative team comprised illusionist Paul Kieve, creative producer Jeremy Goldstein, video artist Jonathan Allen, set designer Laura Hopkins, musician Rohan Kriwaczek and the performers Paloma Faith, Geneva Foster Gluck, Violetta Misic, Agnes Czerna and Tai Shani. In The New Statesman, Judith Palmer described the piece as 'part art installation, part visual theatre and part fairground ride - a purpose-built train whisking audiences 20 at a time through a magical environment of optical illusions and performance vignettes...In silk kimonos and jaunty tutus, a succession of powdered lovelies wafts silently in and out of our vision - reaching out through broken windows, floating above station platforms, sinking into the floor, or spinning in midair....women contorted into small spaces, cut in half, suspended between realities, lost between border crossings.' In a four star review in the Guardian, Lyn Gardner described the rides as 'a marvellous mix of technical wizardry and sheer heart and soul.'Lyn Gardner, 'Carnesky's Ghost Train', The Guardian, 4 May 2004 The train toured the UK for five years, and had residencies at the Trumans Brewery in Brick Lane, Coventry City Centre, Glastonbury Festival and Zomer Van Antwerpen in Belgium. It then became a permanent attraction in Blackpool's Golden Mile, in collaboration with the Blackpool Illuminations, where it won the 2011 British Tourism Award. Reviewing the show in Blackpool, Libby Purves wrote in The Times: 'Combining a cultural classy edge with a lot of enjoyable screaming, Carnesky's Ghost Train is a passionate tribute to war scattered refugee ghosts. It was a success in London and is now even better, both more serious and more fun.'Libby Purves, 'Carnesky's Ghost Train', The Times Magic War In 2007, Carnesky created Magic War, inspired by the French government's use of the stage magician, Robert Houdin, to suppress an uprising in Algeria in 1856. With dramaturgy from Lois Weaver and Flick Ferdinando, the show included stage magic from Paul Kieve, and costumes and props by Sarah Munro and Mark Copeland of the Insect Circus. Carnesky appeared as Athena the goddess of strategic war, reimagined as a stage magician performing illusions, accompanied by a male stage assistant, played by various actors. In her Guardian review, Lyn Gardner described the piece as 'an intriguing look at war and violence, and the illusions to which we all fall prey....(It) combines magic, commentary and audience participation. One hapless audience member is cast as a terrorist and the audience asked to determine her fate based on a series of questions. There are serious points here about ethics and retribution, made all the more horrific when she is sent to the guillotine.'Lyn Gardner, 'Magic War', The Guardian, 2 November 2007 Carnesky's Finishing School In 2008–11, Carnesky was artist in residence at the Roundhouse in London, where she established Carnesky's Finishing School, teaching performance skills to young people aged 17–21 over four semesters. In 2015–16, the school had a pop-up residency in the former Foyles building in Soho. Carnesky, assisted by Lisa Lee of Lipsinkers, offered students 'classes in esoteric PE, situationist clowning, unpopular expressionism and transmetaformism.'Carnesky's Finishing School page on the Crying Out Loud website The students were then taken through the process of devising, creating and performing their own work on stage in front of a paying audience. Graduates of the school include MisSa Blue, Laura Gwen Miles, Tallulah Haddon, Tom Cassani, Oozing Gloop and Oberon White. The National Fairground Archive From 2007–2010, Carnesky had a Creative and Performing Arts Fellowship at the National Fairground Archive in Sheffield University. In her honour, in 2011, the University 'presented a spectacular exhibition and a feast for the senses, Memoirs of a Showwoman.'The Marisa Carnesky Collection at the Fairground Archive, Sheffield Displays showcased costumes from Carnesky's shows, including the dress worn by Paloma Faith for Carnesky´s Ghost Train, collaborative work with artists such as Anthony Bennett, Sarah Munro and Mark Copeland, and previously unseen material from her personal archive. The National Fairground Archive now holds a Marisa Carnesky Collection. Dystopian Wonders For the Roundhouse Circus Festival in 2010, Carnesky made Dystopian Wonders. She played the role of a morbid 'Madame Tussauds'-esque showwoman guiding audiences through her 'bizarre exhibition of curious nameless bodies that merge flesh with beautifully constructed wounds and organs made of wax, silk and embroidered felt. One has two heads. A naked lady levitates. A glamorous contortionist disappears into an open torso. Among the featured artistes was Marawa The Amazing, who gracefully climbed a ladder of sabres barefoot, recreating a turn made popular by the female French magician and crocodile-charmer, Koringa, in the 1930s.''Dystopian Wonders' in the archive section of Carnesky's website Following the Roundhouse production, 'Dystopian Wonders' was staged at the Crucible Theatre Sheffield, the Lowry Salford and Chelsea Theatre. The Quickening of the Wax Anatomical models inspired The Quickening of the Wax, staged by Carnesky on Halloween night in 2010 for the Chelsea Theatre's Sacred festival. The Time Out listing described the show: 'Marisa Carnesky, long fascinated with the body as a site of abjection and storytelling, draws on her penchant for the uncanny with a Halloween show unlike any other. Magic, horror and social history combine as anatomical models come to life in spectacular, ritualistic fashion'.'The Quickening of the Wax', Time Out, October 2010 The creative team comprised Anthony Bennett (wax work sculptor), Rasp Thorne (music), Helen Plewis (performer and choreographer), Marty Langthorne (lighting designer) and Jon Marshall (magic illusions).Jamie McLaren, 'Marisa Carnesky & Rasp Thorne: 'The Quickening of the wax' at the Chelsea Theatre', Run Riot!, 10.10.10 Carnesky’s Tarot Drome Carnesky's Tarot Drome, first staged at the Old Vic Tunnels in 2012, was a large-scale promenade show using interactive installations, skate routines, Mexican wrestling and a live rock band. The creative producers were Lara Clifton and Dicky Eaton, the costumes were by Claire Ashley, and a large fairground facade was painted by Martha Copeland. Audience members, given their own card reading using the Tarot of Marseilles, were invited on an interactive journey in which Carnesky played ringmaster to a dozen Tarot card figures. The Time Out reviewer described 'eye-contact encounters with the likes of the Empress (Suri Sumatra), all enveloping arms and seductive fruit; the Chariot (Rhyannon Styles), who combines transgender identity and sleb-culture narcissism; and Death (Nina Felia), a transformative figure who emerges from striking immobility into unbounded flexibility. Bosch-style beasties, self-sufficient singalongs and aquatic thrashings are also to be found....It's a rich, heady and provocative experience.''Carnesky's Tarot Drome', Time Out, September 2010 The Tarot Drome was later staged at Latitude Festival (2013), and the Cirque Jules Verne in Amiens (2014). Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman In 2013–19, Carnesky completed a PhD at the University of Middlesex. The title of her thesis was 'Dr Carnesky's Incredible Bleeding Woman, Reinventing Menstrual Rituals Through New Performance Practices'. As part of her research, she assembled a group of women, the Menstruants. For nine months, on every dark moon, they gathered at Metal, the Southend Arts Centre, where they devised ritual performances. Carnesky also put on a stage show, in which she appeared as a lecturer presenting a condensed version of her research. The lecture was described by Maddy Costa as 'a playful survey of mythology and religion and art that has, over the centuries, attempted to capture and control the menstruating woman, harness her power for patriarchy's advancement.'Maddy Costa, 'A Visit from Auntie Flo, Exeunt, January 2017 The Menstruants (Fancy Chance, Rhyannon Styles, MisSa Blue, H Plewis, Sula Plewis Robbins and Nao Nagai) appeared on stage and on film, enacting their rituals, 'a carmine carnival of sword-swallowing, body-sawing and hair-hanging, carnal in its original sense of human, of the flesh.' The show was staged as a work in progress in 2015 at University College London, as part of the Radical Anthropology Group. Here Carnesky and Dr Camilla Power launched an activist group, the Menstronauts, which any woman could join to create menstrual rituals. Power and Carnesky wrote, 'We believe that disregard for the cycles of the human body echoes a disregard for the cycles of the planet and for each other. We seek to reclaim time through respect for the bodily cycles we evolved as humans, and for the original cultural means of counting time – the waxing and waning of the moon.'Marisa Carnesky, 'Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman, Reinventing Menstrual Rituals Through New Performance Practices. PhD Thesis, Middlesex University Research Repository, 2019, p 192 Dr Carnesky's Incredible Bleeding Woman, produced by Lara Clifton with dramaturgy from Kira O’Reilly, toured widely. In 2017, it was staged at the Soho Theatre, the Underbelly, Southbank, and the Edinburgh and Adelaide Fringes. This was followed by a 2018 residency at the Attenborough Centre for Creative Arts at Sussex University, which commissioned a further development of the piece. A UK tour followed ending with a return to Soho Theatre. The show received universal acclaim from the critics.Lyn Gardner, 'Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman review – menstrual mystery tour', The Guardian, 19 December 2016Ben Walters, 'Theatre review: Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman' The Scotsman, August 2017Mary Brennan, 'Dr Carnesky's Incredible Bleeding Woman', The Herald, August 2017Dorothy Max Prior, 'Carnesky Productions: Dr Carnesky's Incredible Bleeding Woman', Total Theatre, January 2017 Showwoman. Ritual. Action In 2019, Carnesky presented a new work in progress, Showwoman. Ritual. Action, at the British Library and for Duckie at the Vauxhall Tavern. This grew out of her thesis, in which she wrote, 'I am a Showwoman. With two Ws in the middle, one for the show and one for the woman.'Marisa Carnesky, 'Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman, Reinventing Menstrual Rituals Through New Performance Practices. PhD Thesis, Middlesex University Research Repository, 2019, p 52 Here she described the role of the Showwoman 'using her spectacular vision in acts that are transformative and collaborative and an antidote to the entertainment traditions of the exploitative tropes of the showman.' Her collaborators were David Sheppeard (creative producer), Elf Lyons (dramaturg) and Mark Copeland and Sarah Munro (costumes and design).

It was first described to science by Theodore Lyman in 1860.. Lyman states in his description that the animal is named for his friend, Alexander E. R. Agassiz, the son of Lyman's mentor, Louis Agassiz.  Description  G: dorsal view, H: dorsal view of the arm, I: ventral view of the arm, J: dorsal view of the disk, K: ventral view of the disk, L: jaw This animal is pentaradially symmetric with five arms attached to a central disk. It is dark brown in color, with lighter bands on the upper side of the arms. The lighter parts are gray with hints of green or yellow tones. The colors change on a daily cycle, which, like the banding, may be a form of camouflage to hide the brittle star from predatory fish. Males and females are identical in appearance. The central disk is rounded with small bumps on its upper side. The disk can be up to across. It contains the mouth, digestive system, and gonads. The arms are very flexible, but when straight give the brittle star a diameter of up to . As its common name suggests, the arms are quite spiny, with five to seven long spines on each lateral plate.  Distribution  This brittle star lives from the intertidal zone to a depth of 70 meters (230 feet). It is benthic, living on the sea bed, favoring rocky bottoms and coral reefs. The species lives in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to Colombia, including the Gulf of California. It is found in the Galapagos Islands.  Life history  Alexander's brittle stars reproduce by broadcast spawning. It is gonochoric, having individuals that are either male or female, with approximately equal numbers of each sex. Males and females release sperm and eggs into the sea where they meet for fertilization. These zygotes develop into free-swimming pluteus larva. This species feeds on detritus. There is evidence that these brittle stars catch and eat small fish in aquariums.

It is endemic to southern Turkey where it has a moderately large range and is considered near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Description The dorsal surface of P. caralitanus is greenish-brown heavily blotched with dark brown. It is similar in appearance to the Levant water frog (Pelophylax bedriagae) and the marsh frog (Pelophylax ribibundus), the two other lowland species of frog found in Turkey, but differs in being rather larger and not having longitudinal brown stripes on the head and back. It can also be distinguished from them by having a pale neck and belly blotched with red, orange, or sometimes yellow. Distribution and habitat Pelophylax caralitanus is endemic to the Turkish Lakes Region of southwestern Turkey where it is found from the Konya Plain to Denizli. It has been recorded in Lake Beyşehir, Lake Eğirdir, Lake Suğla, Çarşamba Creek (Konya), Lake Gölcük (Isparta), Lake Hotamiş, Ivriz (Ereğli/Konya), Işikli Lake in Çivril (Denizli), and Çardak (Denizli). It occupies lakes, reservoirs, ponds, pools, rivers, streams, ditches, springs and marshes. It is tolerant of disturbed habitats such as fish ponds. Ecology This is an aqueous species of frog which spends the main part of its life in fresh water locations with plentiful vegetation. The tadpoles are herbivorous and feed on algae while the diet of the adult frog consists largely of insects and other aqueous invertebrates and their larvae; this is sometimes supplemented by the consumption of tadpoles. Status This frog is the largest edible frog native to Turkey and is collected for food, being exported commercially to France, Italy and Switzerland. It is also threatened by water extraction and loss of habitat, with several dams being planned to provide drinking water and crop irrigation. It is however present in two protected areas, Lake Kovada National Park and Lake Beyşehir National Park. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being near-threatened.

It is found in Europe. Life cycle Adults lay their eggs on the buds of various species of oak, including common oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Q. petraea), downy oak (Q. pubescens), Algerian oak (Q. canariensis), chestnut oak (Q. montana) and Turkey oak (Q. cerris). The galls of the asexual generation are up to 5 mm across, hard and woody and have one to five smooth rounded lobes. They first appear in late summer but do not mature until the following July when the adults insect emerge. Females lay their eggs on the buds of Turkey oak and the galls develop during late winter. This is the gall of the sexual generation which is pale green at first, thin-walled and as they mature, they become tinged with pink and later turn orange-brown. Mature sexual galls are about 2.5 mm long, egg-shaped with a pointed tip and can resemble the mature galls of Andricus kollari.

It was published by André Deutsch and contains 15 short stories.  Synopsis   Grandmother's Footsteps  The narrator cannot sleep because a long-fingernailed, messy-haired figure (presumably a man) is tormenting him outside of his window, promising to take him on a magic carpet ride to a magical breadstick land if he opens the window. Terrified, the narrator calls for his grandmother and tells her everything. They listen to the man's tapping outside and Grandma decides to distract the narrator with a ghost story. The story is about a boy named Jolyon, who is reading a book in his bedroom when he hears loud tapping from outside, which becomes faster and faster. He pulls his duvet over his head and watches the silhouette of a giant hand tap the window and smash the glass. He screamed in fear and his grandmother ran into the room, armed with a bedpan. The end. The narrator is annoyed because Grandma promised that a ghost would appear. Grandma explains that the tapping came from the branches of the apple tree moving in the wind and the storm had caused the branch to break the window. As for the ghost, she says, \\"Here I am!\\" She walks towards the door, stops to take off her head, and disappears; outside, footsteps are heard fading away. The narrator did not sleep for a week.  Burgers  Burgerskip is the most successful fast food chain in the world, particularly in the UK. At the end of every school day, children of all ages would race out of school to meet with friends and grab their dinner at the Burgerskip in Crawley High Street, as the chain's mascot — a clown — would watch over them. The clown was based on Burgerskip's CEO, Seamus O'Burger, who is planning to expand his fast-food empire even further as his helicopter team escorts him to the Amazon rainforest. O'Burger decides to have parts of it bulldozed so that there would be more space for farmland, after his pilot suggests it to him. The next day, O'Burger leads a team of bulldozers through the forest, pushing over trees and pulling up flowers. O'Burger's Amazon guide realises the extent of his tourist's plans and begs him at break time not to cut any further. Seamus ignores him as he eats his breakfast burger and orders the bulldozing team to continue. The guide refers to the tree opposite Seamus, explaining that the Amazonian tribes respected it as a deity named Panachek, the \\"heart and soul\\" of the rainforest. Seamus notices that the team have become hesitant to follow his orders and cuts Panachek down with a chainsaw. Everyone and everything in the rest of the rainforest watches in mournful silence as the tree tips over dead and Seamus stands triumphant. The chain becomes more successful to the point of Burgerskip rapidly running out of supplies. Seamus spends a lot of time with his helicopter team to travel around the world for more farmland space, whether forests had to be bulldozed or not. Meanwhile, in the UK, a little girl named Charlotte visits Crawley High Street's Burgerskip with her father. Charlotte orders a Jolly Burger with chips and takes a bite outside. She splutters and chokes and shows her father the tiny mahogany tree inside it. The news of the burger reaches Burgerskip headquarters and to Seamus, who redirects the plane to make an emergency meeting with the board of directors. Terrified of disappointing their boss, the directors are hesitant to speak up but one stammers that other complaints about trees in burgers have reached their headquarters. The tour guide from the Amazonia enters the room and refers to outside the window. Seamus looks out to see hundreds of Burgerskip buildings suspending in the air by trees. The tour guide explains that this is a part of Panachek's revenge for destroying the Amazon and that he is not finished with Seamus yet. Seamus jumps on the guide and attempts to strangle him but the boardroom starts to shake. The ghost of Panachek bursts through the floor, picks up Seamus and shoots up into the sky. It was the last time Seamus was seen and Burgerskip was ever successful. An Australian farmer found a part of Seamus' clown costume but it could not be proven that it had belonged to him. The UK became the new rainforest where roasted parrot became a popular meal.  Tag  One day, a boy in Terry Blotch's class arrives at school with a giant marble that he got for his birthday from a Scottish grandmother, which everyone on the playground gathers around to admire. Terry envies his friend's sudden popularity and is determined to make them cry. He sneaks into the classroom and steals a ring from the classmate's desk. This envy triggers a need for Terry to steal and he begins to shoplift from many stores, stealing a variety of items, and stealing from the streets, notably a dog. While hiding in a locker in an empty school changing room, Terry notices a sports bag containing a football kit belonging to \\"A. Phantom\\", according to the name tags. Terry snatches the kit, puts it on and leaves, and wears it for the rest of the day. At home, the name tags cause blemishing rashes that would itch all over. By the next morning, Terry's face is covered in boils. His mother telephones for an emergency home doctor, who recommends that he avoids eating junk food and to have a bath, assuming that it is acne (although he admits that he has no idea whether his hypothesis was accurate). Terry's mother suggests that it is chickenpox when she notices that the boils had spread all over her son's body but Terry knew no one who may have had chickenpox in his class. \\"It's that football kit!\\" his mother cries and runs out of the bathroom. In bed days later, the boils begin to itch and Terry cannot resist scratching them. Each scratched boil exploded and covered his bedroom floor with thick pus, making him howl in pain. His mother rushes in, falling in the pus and gasps: her son's boils had disappeared and he had 1019 \\"A. Phantom\\" name tags sticking out of his body. The biggest (the 1020th) hung from the back of his neck which read \\"Thief\\". She tried to remove the tags with scissors but the name tags regrew whenever she cut them off. She demands to know what is going on so Terry tells her about his secret shoplifting addiction. Terry returned to school the next day, still covered with name tags. He sneaked into the changing room and put the sports bag on the hook he stole it from and runs away. The name tags had disappeared by lunchtime apart from \\"Thief\\", which soon fell off after a few days. Terry never stole again — the slightest itch would remind him of his humiliation, whenever he had a potential shoplifting opportunity — however, he started to get a lot of acne that was hard to get rid of.  The Locked Door  Somewhere in an unspecified country is a house with a locked door that has not been opened in 75 years. Every midnight, blood trickles from a lightbulb, and screams for help and heavy thumping is heard by anyone coincidentally awake. Many people who once lived alone in the house had been found dead days later. It is bought by Matt and Jodie, two deaf newlyweds from New Zealand who give birth to a daughter they named Rosie, who is not deaf and is fascinated by the mysterious locked door that her parents do not want to open. One night, she disappeared. The parents searched every creepy room of the house until the locked door was the only option. Matt kicked the door but the force made the ceiling collapse in front of him. He looked up and saw baby Rosie looking through the hole back at him. Everyone in the house was banned from the loft ever since. That had been three years ago, but Rosie had suffered from nightmares since, and would wake up to the locked door's midnight sounds frequently. This, and being banned from the floor above only fuelled Rosie's curiosity even more. One midnight, Rosie wakes up to scratching and investigated her bedroom's fireplace. Dust shoots out and a voice begs for help; Rosie runs out of the room towards the locked door. A pale hand appeared under the door with a key as a voice begs her to let them free. Rosie takes the key and unlocks it. Inside was an axe, broken furniture and wood. An old man with a long beard is standing behind her and thanks her. Rosie takes him to meet her parents and lets him eat sponge cake; Matt and Jodie are expectantly shocked and surprised that they could hear his voice. The old man explains that he had been locked in the room for years and had spent nights chopping firewood, occasionally cutting his hand. He was most likely 115 years old. Rosie jumps into his lap and lands on the wooden chair.  A Tangled Web  Nigel has a passion for torturing spiders, and a habit of clicking his tongue when he talked and daydreaming with his mouth open. He nicknamed himself \\"Black Nigel\\" and would declare himself the spider that spiders feared, confusing (and sometimes annoying) his parents. One day, Ariadne, a pregnant spider, rushes into his bedroom to prepare for her labour. She crawls towards the wardrobe to make a web at the top. Nigel hears her tiny footsteps and waits, picking up a jar that he hid under his pillow. When Ariadne had spun her web, Nigel swiped the jar across it, trapping her. Nigel screws the lid on and holds the jar against a candle flame, burning the spider alive. He dumps the corpse into a bin outside his window which is collected the next morning by the bin collectors. At the landfill, the ghosts of the unborn babies are \\"born\\" and allow the wind to carry them through the town. The spider ghosts float through Nigel's open bedroom window and into Nigel's open mouth. Hours later, Nigel wakes up with a tight chest as if he had a severe cold; through the night, the spider ghosts had spun webs around his ribcage. Nigel coughs up a spider but only spots it after it had run across the bedsheets. He realises that it came from him when he coughs up another. Nigel never opened his mouth again and now spends a lot of free time knitting. He has no idea why he always knits webs as big as his bedroom. It was just instinct.  The Well  Mr and Mrs Halley live in Wellsdeep cottage in Devon, which has an 1100-year-old well at the bottom of the garden, with a bottom. Mrs Halley wants her husband to cover the well before their two grandsons (Louis and Ben) arrive, who put their hands anywhere. In the morning, Mr Halley promises to do block it but by the afternoon, the boys arrive and the well is not covered. \\"I'll do it tomorrow,\\" says Mr Halley when his wife confronts him. That night, Mr Halley feels tiny hands tickling his feet and touching his eyelids as he sleeps. He jumps out of bed and opens the curtains, and hears laughter coming from the well. He loudly vows to cover it before his wife reminds him that he is not wearing his . At sunrise, Mr Halley races to the well with measuring tape and a pencil but the tape falls down the well before he could read the measurement of the diameter. He has a tantrum, throws his hat after the tape, and tells his wife that he will fix the well tomorrow with better equipment. At lunchtime, Louis and Ben run to the well to play Pirates; Louis sits in the well's bucket to imitate the crow's nest and Ben holds the rope. Mrs Halley runs to the well to stop them as Ben lets go, and grabs the rope before the bucket dropped too far. Mr Halley (who had been asleep inside throughout the incident) is woken up by his wife angrily pouring water over him and splutters that he will fix the well tomorrow. That night, Mr Halley is woken up by the tiny hands and laughter again. He opens the curtains to see a full moon's light making the well glow. He spots a tiny person run out of the back door and jump into the well. He rushes out to the garden with a torch and searches the inside, seeing neither of his grandsons at the bottom. A force pushes him and he lands in the water. He crawls onto a ledge above and calls for help. A little boy climbs out of the water and joins him, introducing himself as The Ghost of Jobs Left Undone, pointing out that the well should have been blocked already. Mr Halley adamantly claims that he was going to do it and the ghost replies that his grandfather had said the same but never kept his promise, which caused his death. Ben and Louis appear at the top, preparing to rescue their grandfather. Mr Halley orders them to not move but they climb into the bucket. The rope snaps and the boys fall into the water. Mr Halley wakes up in his bedroom, soaking wet and screaming. Before the grandsons woke up, he blocked the well the best he could. Mrs Halley is pleased and suggests that he should paint the outside of the house as he promised. Mr Halley says that he will do that tomorrow.  An Elephant Never Forgets  The upper-middle-class Crumpdump family are driving their Rolls-Royce car through the African wilderness on a safari, impatient to see elephants. They eventually find a herd and the children, Belinda and Percy, become excited. \\"I want one!\\" demands Percy. Mrs Crumpdump is against it because a living one would destroy the house and a dead one would stink but Mr Crumpdump remains quiet, hiding his smirk. After the family returns home, a parcel is delivered one breakfast later, containing an elephant's foot. The children are disturbed as Mr Crumpdump proudly explains that he had someone trophy hunt for him but they move the foot towards the door by the leopard skin rug to use as an umbrella stand. One rainy day, before a trip to the shoe shop, Belinda says aloud that she wished that the rain would stop as she takes her umbrella from the elephant's foot. The rain stops and the sun appears in the sky. Percy becomes excited and grabs the foot, wishing to be tall. He grows through the ceiling and then wishes himself back to normal size. The children start to love their magical umbrella stand, making their schoolfriends jealous, and wish for several things every day until the mansion is almost full. They also used it to be lazy: Percy wished that he could go to bed without having a bath and the prepared water dried up, whereas Belinda wished for an excuse to not go to school, making it burn down. However, because Belinda and Percy were spoilt children who already had many toys and games, they were never satisfied with the things they wished for. After running out of ideas, Belinda suggests that they should wish for the elephant they wanted and does so despite Percy's hesitance. A bleeding, three-legged baby elephant limps across the landing towards the stairs. Percy orders his sister to wish it away but Belinda is too scared; the elephant rolls down the stairs and crushes them. Mr and Mrs Crumpdump return home to find a broken staircase, a dirty carpet and the umbrella stand missing (the story writes that it had been stolen). Every night since, the ghosts of their children cry for the elephant's forgiveness. Their parents cannot take another sleepless night and file for divorce.  School Dinners  The narrator has always had a bad relationship with food. It began at lunchtimes during school when the horrible school dinners would be served: unspecified pork fat, cauliflower, prunes, stewed peas, lumpy and cold rice pudding, and Pork rind, to name a few. The school dinner lady would patrol the aisles and openly scold any students that were avoiding certain parts of their plate. Once, she yelled at the narrator to eat his cold and maggot-infested kedgeree so hard that her spittle sprayed it but he still had to eat every mouthful. One student she never had to ask twice was Elgin (nicknamed Blue Bottle by the rest of the school), who worshipped her and the dinners. When he had cleaned his plate, he would crawl under the tables to eat off the floor and then would go to the bin full of leftovers and eat its contents as well, as the rest of the school was forced to listen and tried not to retch. The narrator never got sympathy from his parents, who would lecture that he was ungrateful and selfish because there were children his age in the world that never got a chance to choose, let alone eat. The dinner lady stalked the narrator to check that he had swallowed everything and even followed him into the boys' toilets. Eventually, the narrator's parents agreed to send in a medical note to excuse him from eating school dinners but the dinner lady made him eat it for lunch. Lunchtimes at school traumatised the narrator. He would have nightmares about talking food begging to be eaten and frequently had flashbacks whenever he smelt food that the dinner lady had forced him to eat or Elgin had eaten out of the bin or off the floor. His first panic attack was when he was 22: in a lift, he smelt spotted dick, which made him belch and his stomach churn loudly; he felt spotted dick appear in his mouth and gagged as he forced himself to swallow it. If he ever smelt baked beans being cooked, he crawled under the nearest table and screamed; tomato ketchup and carrots were two of his many trauma triggers. The worst panic attack was the day the narrator took his girlfriend out to a sophisticated French restaurant for a candlelit dinner. Although the menu was full of French meals which would not remind the narrator of anything at school, he decided to order the unspecified £125-for- two special with the champagne, which was brought to the table by the head waiter. The lid was removed to reveal fishcakes, making the narrator scream and cover himself with the tablecloth, spraying champagne over his girlfriend, who then ran out crying in embarrassment. The head waiter is alarmed and the rest of the restaurant paused to watch the commotion. In the narrator's mind, the head waiter had turned into the school dinner lady, who began to demand that he ate the cakes, so he picked up a bread roll and threw it at him, but the head waiter/dinner lady was trying to force him to eat it by waving a spoon with a piece on it towards his mouth. He kicked and screamed and later snapped out of the panic attack, finding himself outside of the restaurant with fish cake around his mouth. The narrator points out that that was a long time ago and he was about to turn 83 next week. He had spent the rest of his life isolating himself from friends and family, and tried not to look at any advertising for food that used to torture him. Unfortunately, he is about to be moved into a retirement home within the next few days which has a scarily- familiar-looking dinner lady that promises to monitor his eating habits.  The Big Sleep  A father is talking to his son as he tucks him in bed. The son asks whether his father could tell whether he was still in a dream. The father replies that he wakes up and just knows but the son continuously repeats the question. The father gives up with a vague answer of \\"just knowing\\" because dreams are too ridiculous to be realistic. Then he unscrews his tail and jumps down to the floor, sings a lullaby out of a navel, screwed his teeth in, kisses his son with one of eight lips and put a sausage in his ear to turn off the bedroom light.  Bogman  Helen loves going to the toilet but only to escape her parents' rules. The complicated back of the toilet allows Helen to hide her comic books from her family's clutches so that her weak bladder excuses are more convincing. One morning, her mother orders her to clean up after breakfast and Helen starts to \\"feel\\" cramps. Her mother threatens that if she disobeyed, The Bogman will come for her. When she returns home from school hours later, Helen asks her father who The Bogman is. He explains as he prepares the family's dinner that six months ago, a skeleton from the Stone Age had been discovered under the drainage of their house and is said to have come to life at times to look for the people that had drowned him in a bog. At dinner, Helen's parents are adamant that Helen washes everyone's dishes. Luckily, her father falls asleep and Helen sneaks away as her mother snaps at him. On the toilet, Helen hears clattering noises, assuming she had called her mother's bluff but the clattering becomes louder and she hears footsteps inside the toilet. A thunderstorm appears in the ceiling and she smells rotting wood as a voice wails for vengeance. A skeleton's hand shoots out of the toilet and grabs Helen, making the toilet break off the hinges. In the kitchen, liquidated peat pours out of the taps and floods the room until it wakes Helen's father up. The Bogman skeleton introduces himself as Marg and accuses Helen's family of killing him. Helen frantically denies it as the skeleton pulls her towards the toilet. Her parents burst into the room as her brother Damien runs to his room for cover. Helen throws a comic to her father, who rolls it and strikes Marg, turning it into a spear. Marg disintegrates into dust and the thunder clouds disappear, leaving the messy kitchen and the wrecked toilet behind. It would take three weeks for the house to be cleaned and fixed, and the epilogue notes that Helen would do the most work. Meanwhile, Marg's disintegrated remains are gathered in a bin bag with peat and dumped in the local landfill, but it is likely that Marg might return someday.  The Broken-Down Cottage  Augustus Filch hated: going to school, his parents, his friends (although the feeling was ironically mutual), and his boring life. Wanting a fresh start, he steals money from his mother's purse and rides the bus into the countryside. After making his way through the creepy woods, he finds an old, abandoned cottage named Dun' Inn and sneaks inside. Downstairs looked old and empty apart from a rocking chair by a working fireplace. A boy is there and introduces himself as Arthur, who had run away from his home as well, many years ago. They share biscuits and Augustus' stolen snacks and decide to prank call. They telephone the police and claim that armed burglars had broken in. Several officers with dogs arrive minutes later and find the two boys cackling and no burglars. The chief of police warns them of crying wolf as he orders the rest of his team out. The next prank call victims are the ambulance service, who arrived minutes later, looking for a boy in shock. Augustus is lying on his back trying to hide his smirk as Arthur acts concerned, but then the two boys begin to laugh, and the ambulance team leave furious with the same message that the police officer had said, but Arthur had already grabbed the telephone to call the fire department, who arrived minutes later. The firefighters leave furious, leaving the boys laughing until their sides hurt. After gaining their composure, the two boys fall asleep in front of the fireplace. The next day, the boys wake up feeling cold. Arthur suggests doing another prank call but Augustus is not in the mood and telephones his parents to take him home. The parents arrive much later to see a burnt Dun' Inn surrounded by the local fire brigade, ambulances and the police. The chief of police explains that there is a possibility that the house burnt down approximately overnight, due to the open fireplace inside. Augustus' mother says that her son had telephoned her from the house to come with his father to collect him because they saw ghosts and were scared for their lives; \\"Sounds like him,\\" the chief of police mumbled to himself. Augustus' parents are allowed inside and find Augustus and another boy unharmed. Augustus' mother asks if they remembered what the ghosts looked like. The boys reply that the ghosts looked like them, then turn around and walk through the walls.  Guilt Ghost  An unnamed man went to a bar and had a bar brawl with another customer. He punched the customer, who fell to their death, and ran away until he was far enough to not be recognised. He buys a house to start a new life and forget about the accident. One day, he hears a voice whispering about the customer's death. The man shushes it. It is the voice of a tiny ghost behind his ear, which whispers that it will not disappear until the man confesses. When the police appear at the front door to ask questions about the bar death, the ghost gives snide commentary as the officer shows off the victim's photograph. The man denies that he ever saw and/or met the customer. The ghost grows to the size of a parrot and sits on the man's shoulder. The man struggles to sleep as the parrot-sized ghost never moves from his shoulder and continues to remind him about his lies. The police officer returns with a scarf that the man had worn on the night of the bar brawl. Despite the officer pointing out the DNA all over it, the man denies being at the bar and/or being involved with any altercations. The parrot-sized ghost jumps off his shoulder and turns into a talking alligator. This version of the ghost never leaves the man's side and never shuts up: it purposely circles the man's feet when he walks to trip him up and the man loses any chance at friendships because he is stubborn and rude (ironically towards the alligator they cannot see) to them. The police officer returns to the house with another officer. The man is drowsy and irritable, with a face full of stubble, exhausted from the alligator ghost's week-long monologuing. The officers have actually come to arrest him because the autopsy and forensic evidence finds him the culprit but the man still denies that he was involved with the bar patron's death. The alligator rolls itself into the corner of the room and begins to shapeshift again, growing a pinkish texture, and turns into a man, and says that he killed the bar patron; he is arrested and escorted out of the house. The man is confused but delighted that his ghost took the blame. He walks into his kitchen to take out beer to celebrate but his hand slides through the handle of the fridge, discovering that he has switched places with his guilt ghost.  A Lesson From History  Elisa joins the queue outside a school hall where her history exam is due to take place within minutes. She hated history lessons and had no motivation to prepare for any tests so she stands worried next to the rest of the students, who are firing miscellaneous questions at each other about a variety of history topics. Miss de Burm the monitoring teacher allows the girls inside and everyone sits at their assigned desks. When the exam begins, Elisa is the only person who is not writing and begins to fidget with her pen until she has ink all over her tongue. She hears a voice call her name but everyone is distracted with their papers. Elisa assumes she imagined the voice until the ghost of a little girl wearing a pinafore approaches her. The ghost girl is named Penny and explains that she went to the school 100 years ago but died when the school caught fire during her History exam. History exams during this time of year is a school tradition so she has returned to haunt it ever since. Miss de Burm marches through the aisles to confront Elisa for talking. As she warns her, Penny dances around and does loud, distracting things, showing that only Elisa can see her. Elisa realises that she had no need to worry about her exam now that someone who had haunted the school for a century was talking to her. Penny agrees to do the exam, picks up the pen and starts answering the questions as Elisa relaxes in her chair. After the writing is finished, the ghost girl says goodbye and walks out the hall through the fire exit door. On Results Day, the history class stands by a bulletin board poster full of everyone's grades, ordered from best to worst by percentage. Rachel, best friend and the student Elisa envied the most, is expectantly at the top of the list with 98% whereas Elisa is shocked to discover that she is at the bottom with 0%. The last paragraph of the story points out that it had not occurred to Elisa that Penny the ghost girl had paid attention to the world around her during her haunting, or whether she had been a studiously-diligent student when she was alive.  The Ghost of Christmas Turkeys Past  Jack loves eating turkey for every meal. His parents loathe the lack of variety but Jack can detect whenever his mother attempts to sneak different but similar-looking meat into her shopping basket. Jack enjoys turkey enough to go on holidays to Greece to see the world's best turkeys. Determined to end his son's turkey obsession for good, on Christmas Eve, Jack's father climbs the roof of a neighbour's house and waits for Father Christmas. Eventually, Father Christmas arrives on his sleigh, crashing into the roof at the shock of seeing a man sitting on it. Jack's father interrupts the magical old man's rant to explain why he caused the distraction. Father Christmas is disappointed because he loves turkey as much as Jack but reluctantly uses his Christmas magic. Jack wakes up to see a one-legged talking chicken in his bedroom. It introduces itself as the Ghost of Christmas Turkeys Past and flies Jack to an empty field. It shows Jack a retirement home for unused turkeys, showing elderly anthropomorphic turkeys looking exhausted and miserable. It points out how turkey is wasted throughout holiday seasons and then neglected when it does not live up to expectations, adding that it caused his leg to disappear. Jack points out that he still loves eating turkey as turkey bones rain over him for 20 minutes. Another turkey appears, dressed as an army general: The Ghost of Christmas Turkeys Present. It takes Jack to a broiler room full of turkeys and explains how abusive and terrifying the poultry farming industry is for its species, especially during December. Jack begins to feel unwell from watching the turkeys suffering but admits that he still likes turkey regardless. In walks a turkey the size of a human dressed similarly to a hippie who takes Jack's hand and flies up to the outer atmosphere. Jack feels more queasy as the turkey circles the Earth a few times and lands in front of a house. The turkey explains that they have time- travelled 100 years into the future, to 2090. Jack looks through the window to see a family of anthropomorphic turkeys sitting down at a table for Christmas dinner. The mother walks in with a lid-covered plate and places it in the middle of the table as the excited family look on. The lid is removed to reveal Jack's cooked corpse. It is the morning of Christmas Day when Jack wakes up screaming from his nightmare. At the inevitable Christmas dinner, Jack barely eats. His father (looking notably smug) points out that he did not immediately reach for a piece of turkey. Jack gathers some of the surrounding vegetables as he says that he is not in the mood today. His father looks up to the ceiling and silently prays his thanks to Father Christmas.  Rogues Gallery: The Seven Most Wanted Ghosts in Britain  This story is a list of the seven most-wanted ghosts in Britain. In order: #Old Hollow Legs (Case number 101X): Winner of the Greediest Ghost of Greenwich competition. He is a giant head on a pair of legs, who died ten years before due to unspecified reasons about a slice of chocolate fudge. He often steals from the living's fridges or waits under dinner tables to catch falling scraps; #Transparent Tony (Case number 102X): Tony causes people to lie badly, especially children. He whispers into targets' ears and the target repeats what they heard; #The Headless Coachman (Case number 103X): Similar to the Headless Horseman, the Coachman drives a horse-drawn coach and causes traffic jams on the M25; #The Bermuda Triangle (Case number 104X): A secret organisation full of the ghosts of 700 South American gangsters based in the sea. They frequently steal model boats and remote control planes from unsuspecting children; #Nostalgic Nora (Case number 105X): Nora possesses the elderly, causing them to talk about trivial things about their childhood for long periods of time; # The Immortal Remains of Henry Fink (Case number 106X): The smelly, disembowelled remains of Henry Fink, who was killed by an axe murderer in 1970, which scatter themselves around every house they haunt; #Smudger (Case number 107X): The reason why eaten food stains clothes and smears against lips and cheeks.  Themes  Compared to the previous book in the series, the stories in Ghostly Tales for Ghastly Kids reflects the title consistently because ghosts appear as main characters, whether heroes or villains. They are frequently poltergeists that can act the same as they would when alive or they have magical powers (\\"Rogues Gallery\\", \\"Guilt Ghost\\", \\"The Ghost of Christmas Turkeys Past\\", \\"Tag\\"), and vary from turkey ghosts, child ghosts, and Judge A. Phantom Esq, who punishes stealing children.: What Terry didn't know was that he would never be challenged by A. PHANTOM because A. PHANTOM did not exist. A. PHANTOM was a ghost — an exceedingly law-abiding ghost, who travelled through time and space in a never ending quest to bring thieving children to justice. The first story, \\"Grandmother's Footsteps\\", used the phrase ghost story as word play because the plot twist of the grandmother being dead all along changed the phrase's meaning to \\"story from a ghost\\";: \\"A Lesson From History\\" uses wordplay for ghostwriter because a ghost wrote Elisa's exam. Meanwhile, \\"Guilt Ghost\\" and \\"The Broken-Down Cottage\\" end with the main character(s) discovering that they had died. \\"The Big Sleep\\" is the only story that is not about or features ghosts. There are also examples of ethical arguments on environmental issues: \\"An Elephant Never Forgets\\" uses the social class of the wealthy Crumpdump family: Belinda and Percy Crumpdump belonged to Mr and Mrs Crumpdump of Crumpdump Road, Crumpdump town, in Crumpdump County. Mr Crumpdump was a very, very wealthy man and owned an entire town all by himself. to imply that they have participated in trophy hunting occasionally, Mr Crumpdump boasting that he paid someone to kill a baby elephant for him,: and his children leaving their present next to a rug made out of leopard skin in the hallway because they did not like the present, although they were prepared to have an entire elephant corpse.: In \\"Burgers\\", Seamus' greed and desire to own the most successful restaurant in the world makes him deforest the Amazonia.: No character is portrayed as sympathetic.: Seamus' evil plan for world domination through the minds and stomachs of children was having a far more sinister effect. In his bid for global expansion, Seamus was sacrificing the heart and lungs of the planet. The Amazonian Rain Forest.: \\"The Well\\", \\"A Lesson From History\\" and \\"Bogman\\" are stories about laziness: Elisa refuses to prepare for an exam in a lesson she loathes and then makes a ghost do the test for her, whereas \\"Bogman\\" and \\"The Well\\" are also about procrastination. \\"Tag\\" is about envy, which leads to kleptomania. \\"The Broken- Down Cottage\\" is the first story in the book series that is about the dangers of playing pranks, along with \\"Knock Down Ginger\\" and \\"The Gas Man Cometh\\" from More Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids, \\"Monty's Python\\" from Nasty Little Beasts, and \\"The Piranha Sisters\\" from Blubbers and Sicksters.  Television adaptation  Only six stories were not adapted for the cartoon programmes: \\"The Well\\", \\"School Dinners\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Guilt Ghost\\", \\"The Ghost of Christmas Turkeys Past\\", and \\"Rogues Gallery\\". Out of these six, \\"The Big Sleep\\" and \\"Rogues Gallery\\" are a short story and a list, respectively. It has not been explained why the rest were not adapted, however. With the rest, there have been changes in the adaptations. For example: *\\"Burgers\\"' episode was renamed as \\"Burgerskip\\" (Series 1, Episode 8), after the eponymous restaurant. Seamus was renamed as Oswald and dressed as a cowboy instead of a clown. *\\"Tag\\" (Series 2, Episode 9) changed the owner of the football kit from A. Phantom to Jim Spectre. *\\"Bogman\\" (Series 4, Episode 5) changed the action of Helen throwing the comic book to her father to her brother Damien throwing the comic book to him instead. In the book, Damien had run to his bedroom to hide. *\\"A Lesson From History\\" was adapted as the episode \\"The History Lesson\\" (Series 1, Episode 11). The main character was renamed Elizabeth from Elisa, which can be the full version of \\"Elisa\\". *\\"An Elephant Never Forgets\\" changed minor details: ** When Belinda wished the rain would stop, it is not mentioned that the family were going out to the shoe shop; ** The rug that the umbrella stand is placed next to is tiger skin instead of leopard; ** Percy wishes he was tall instead of twenty; **The children's wishes that get them out of school and having a nighttime bath are not included; ** Mr and Mrs Crumpdump move out of their now-haunted mansion instead of divorcing.  Publication history  The original front cover was illustrated by Bobbie Spargo, who was also illustrator. Sue Heap illustrated the front cover in the 1995 edition,: \\"Cover illustration by Sue Heap\\" but Spargo's story illustrations were still included in the book (he only illustrated for \\"Rogues Gallery\\").: \\"Inside illustrations (C) Bobbie Spargo, 1992\\" After the cartoon series aired on CITV, the covers were re-designed by Honeycomb Animation, the producers of the cartoon.

Within the songs, each part is called a \\"bit\\" or a \\"piece\\". Musically, the album represents a return to the more electronic, beat-driven sound of the band's earliest albums, while also incorporating conceptual and organic elements that echo approaches heard on the band's later releases. \\"Love You to Bits\\" (Bit 1) was released as a single in early November 2019, along with a 13-minute non-album instrumental B-side entitled \\"Love You to Shreds (Shreds 1–3)\\".

The company was founded in 2012 in Bridgeport, Connecticut by Joe Rubin and Ryan Emerson, who created it to restore and distribute lost and otherwise unavailable films, including vintage X-rated and pornographic films. Their catalog has since expanded to include other types of cult and exploitation films, including horror films and action films. Vinegar Syndrome has been called \\"as important to physical media and film preservation\\" as the Criterion Collection, another film restoration and distribution company, and has received praise for the selection and quality of their home video releases. History Vinegar Syndrome, named for the acidic smell of deteriorating film, was founded in 2012 by Joe Rubin and Ryan Emerson. The company was founded to restore and distribute X-rated films from the 1960s to the 1980s, including pornographic films released during the Golden Age of Porn, on home media. Rubin and Emerson emphasized that the company is not a part of the pornography industry, with Rubin noting that they choose to restore films that they feel \\"provide value\\", and stating: \\"We are film archivists who happen to focus on preserving sex films.\\" The first three films to be released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome were each directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis—Ecstasies of Women, Linda and Abilene (both 1969), and Black Love (1971). Previously thought to be lost, they were released in 2013 in a box set titled The Lost Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis. Since that debut release, Vinegar Syndrome's catalog has expanded to include cult and exploitation films in a variety of genres, including horror films and action films. Formats DVD and Blu-ray Vinegar Syndrome began publishing films on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013, starting with the release of the Lost Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis box set. In 2015, Chris Coffel of Bloody Disgusting ranked Vinegar Syndrome as one of the five best Blu-ray labels releasing horror films on physical media, praising the company's customer service and calling the quality of their releases \\"breathtaking\\". That same year, Matt Serafini of Dread Central wrote of Vinegar Syndrome's releases: \\"Vinegar Syndrome has only been on the scene for a few years, but they've proved themselves a force to be reckoned with.\\" Streaming service In 2015, Vinegar Syndrome began developing a subscription-based, VOD-style streaming service called Skinaflix, described by Rubin as \\"Netflix for sex films, but curated for cinephiles\\". Funded by an Indiegogo campaign, the service was initially intended to offer sexploitation films and other X-rated works, but its catalog was expanded to include films from other genres prior to its launch.

The rebels established their own state, the Ibāḍī imamate. Its causes laid in a deep- rooted rivalry between northern and southern tribes of Muscat and Oman. It began in May 1913 in Tanuf. On 5 June, the rebels captured Nizwa, and on 20 June they captured Izki. By this time, the rebels had also surrounded Samail. On 24 June, the rebels captured al-\`Awabi. By July, the situation had gotten so dire that the British government sent a small garrison to Natrah to aid the sultan of Muscat, to no avail. In August, the rebels captured Samail. Also in August, the rebels launched an offensive towards the coastal side of al-Jabal al-Akhda, and Nakhl was besieged on the 4th. Nakhl ultimately fell at the beginning of April 1914, after the desertion of several of the imam's reinforcement contingents. In April 1914 the Royal Air Force bombed Barkah and Qaryat to deter rebel attacks on those settlements. In January 1915 the rebels began a long-anticipated attack on Muscat city. On the 7th the Imam had gathered with 400 men at Bidbid. Al-Watayyah was raided on the 8th, and on the 9th firing was heard in the nearby hills. The rebels advanced to the village of Bawshar and gathered at the village of al-Khuwayr. The two forces merged and advanced to al-Watayyah by the 10th. They were opposed by 750 Indian Army troops, composed of the 102nd grenadiers, led by Col. S. M. Edwardes (now in overall command), stationed at Bayt al-Falaj; and the 95th Russell's Infantry, commanded by F. F. Major, and stationed at Ruwi village. A small detachment of Arab retainers was to protect Dar Sayt, but actually fled when fighting began. On 11 January, British forces launched a large-scale counterattack, and the 750 British troops succeeded at driving back around 3,000 rebels troops, causing 350 casualties with the rebel chief Isa bin Salih being wounded and his brother killed. By April 1915, German agents had arrived in the Ibāḍī imamate. The general perception of the rebels at that time was that Germans had more or less emerged victorious in the war in Europe, that Wilhelm II had and his followers had converted to Islam, and that it was prudent to continue fighting the British and the sultan until they would be driven out of Arabia. Thus, they rejected all attempts by Britain to broker a peace settlement, which the British government desired due to a need for British troops elsewhere.https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023510026.0x000010 In July the forts of Rushtaq and Hazam surrendered to the Rebels.https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023510026.0x00000e However, the Sultan also recaptured some settlements in late July, such as the port of Daghmar and headquarters of Hayl al-Gha. In June 1916, the Imam's forces attacked Bahi and al-Rustaq. While the former assault succeeded, the latter assault failed and the rebels opted to besiege it instead. al-Rushtaq finally fell in August 1917. Stalemate ensued for the following years. The final battle took place in April 1920 in al-Hazm, where a rebel assault was once again repelled. The rebels sued for peace in September 1920, ending the war.

The game has two sequels, The Surgeon II and The Surgeon III. In this game, the player is a surgeon. Dr. Myo Thant, The Surgeon's designer, would later go on to design Life & Death, a surgical game with similar elements, albeit with a wider release. Gameplay In The Surgeon, the player takes the role of a surgeon in a hospital. The game begins with the player meeting with a patient, and being provided with either an x-ray of the spine or an ultrasound examination of the abdomen, both of which may need to be requested by the player for further insight rather than being given to begin with. When meeting with a patient, the player may judge the patient's condition from a description of symptoms from the patient and the information they're given, and the player may choose to observe the patient (do nothing), prescribe painkillers, or operate. Inaction, such as prescribing painkillers or doing nothing if a patient's condition is serious and time- sensitive, may result in the patient's death. Patients may also die from failed surgery, or abrupt complications during surgery if the player fails to treat them in time. Patients may also die post-surgery from infection if the player neglects to sterilize the area with antiseptic solution before and after surgery, or by not washing their hands.The Surgeon (1985), Macintosh. Information Systems for Medicine. Information Systems for Medicine. The death of a patient resets the player's progress, and The Surgeon lacks a save function. The Surgeon's manual details possible medical afflictions the player will need to diagnose and treat in-game, describing their symptoms and the treatment needed. The manual also offers detailed step-by-step instructions for the surgeries in The Surgeon.  Reception  Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of The Surgeon; the reviewer is a licensed doctor of medicine. Macworld says that the beginning of the game becomes \\"boring\\" after playing it several times, a necessity due to the game's lack of a save function, and due to a patient's death resetting progress in-game, they express that \\"you find yourself going through the early steps again and again.\\" Macworld praises the gameplay and graphics, stating that \\"The operation consists of a well-defined series of steps that begins with scrubbing yourself and preparing the patient's skin with antiseptic solution. During surgery, any of several potentially fatal complications may arise. If you fail to recognize or treat them properly, the patient will die\\", calling the gameplay a \\"reasonably accurate simulation\\" and \\"fast paced\\", but disputes a claim in the game's manual that the game may be valuable to medical students, instead suggesting that \\"it might prove educational and challenging to nonmedical personnel.\\" Frank Boosman reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"as a friend of mine has pointed out, Surgeon would excel in applications such as giving medical students their first taste of surgery, or perhaps showing a patient and his or her family exactly what would be done during an operation. The list goes on.\\" INFO reviewed the Amiga version of The Surgeon, giving it three out of five stars. The reviewer wrote that the game was \\"definitely not for the squeamish\\" and an \\"absolutely realistic simulation where you must make quick, correct decisions to fix an aneurysm.\\" INFO expressed that \\"Additional diseases would have given this more stars, but once you've mastered the aneurysm, there's nothing else to do.\\" Datormagazin, the Swedish computer magazine, gave the Amiga version three out of five stars. Datormagazin praised The Surgeon's \\"helpful\\" UI and that the game offers hints as to what to do during surgery, and stated that \\"Surgeon seems to be a realistic simulation of an operation, it's not just cutting in, removing the bad part, putting in a new one and sewing them up. There are many steps involved, and if you do not have any medical education or equivalent, it is doubtful if you can do it at all.\\" Datormagazin further notes the game's difficulty, expressing that \\"In the manual, there are step-by-step instructions for the operation ... But even if you have those instructions in front of you, it's uncertain that you'll succeed ... Even if you get as far as sewing the patient back together again, he may die after the surgery, because you made a small mistake during the operation.\\" They also say that their interest in the game \\"only went so far\\", expressing that \\"for a doctor or medical student, this game is probably very good, fun, and interesting. For me, who's just an ordinary person, it's not as fun.\\" Datormagazin calls The Surgeon \\"an original and fun idea\\", but states that \\"it is worse than games meant for the general public\\" due to its niche audience.

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (NGDB) is an American country rock band from Long Beach, California. Formed in October 1965, the group was originally a jug band featuring guitarist and vocalist Jeff Hanna, guitarists Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr and Dave Hanna, bassist and guitarist Les Thompson, and drummer Glen Grosclose. The current lineup of the band features Jeff Hanna, Jimmie Fadden on drums, harmonica and vocals (since 1966), Bob Carpenter on keyboards and vocals (since 1979), Jim Photoglo on bass and guitar (since 2005), Jaime Hanna on guitar and vocals, and Ross Holmes on mandolin and fiddle (both since 2018). History 1965–1982 The NGDB evolved from the Illegitimate Jug Band in late 1965, with the original lineup featuring Jeff Hanna, Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, Dave Hanna and Glen Grosclose. By February 1966, Dave Hanna and Grosclose had left, with their places taken by Jackson Browne and Jimmie Fadden. Browne remained only until July, when he left to start a solo career. He was replaced the following month by John McEuen, who played banjo, mandolin, guitar and fiddle. After the release of The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Ricochet, Kunkel left the NGDB in December 1967 and was replaced by Chris Darrow, formerly of Kaleidoscope. Darrow contributed to the studio album Rare Junk and the live release Alive!, before the band went on hiatus at the end of 1968. Six months later, the band returned with Jimmy Ibbotson in place of Darrow. Three albums followed – Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy, All the Good Times and Will the Circle Be Unbroken – before the group was reduced to a quartet when Thompson departed in late 1973. By mid-1976, Ibbotson had also left and new members John Cable (guitar, bass, vocals) and Jackie Clark (bass, guitar, keyboards) had joined the group, whose name had been shortened to simply the Dirt Band. Around a month after returning home following a string of shows in the Soviet Union, Clark left the Dirt Band and Cable was dismissed by Hanna. Hanna, Fadden and McEuen then rebuilt the band with the addition of bassist Richard Hathaway, saxophonist Al Garth and drummer Merel Bregante. The Dirt Band went through a succession of drummers during its tenure – by the summer of 1979, Bregante had been replaced by Mike Buono, former Jimmy Buffett drummer Michael Gardner took over from Buono in May 1980, and the following year saw Vic Mastrianni take over the position. After contributing to The Dirt Band and An American Dream as a guest session contributor, keyboardist Bob Carpenter officially joined the group in 1979. Jealousy followed in 1981, after which Garth also left and was replaced briefly by Bryan Savage. 1982 onwards By 1982, Jimmy Ibbotson had returned and the Dirt Band had reverted to its original name of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. As a five-piece, the group released four studio albums in four years, before McEuen left in January 1987 to focus on his family. He was replaced in March by former Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon, although he only remained until the following July, when he left to focus on his solo career. The NGDB remained a four-piece for the following 13 years, before McEuen rejoined for a run of reunion shows starting in July 2001. The return of McEuen was later made official for a new album and resulting tours. After the tour for 2004's Welcome to Woody Creek, the group returned to a four-piece again when Ibbotson left for a second time. In May 2016, Jim Photoglo joined the NGDB in time for the group's 50th anniversary tour. McEuen left for a second time in October 2017, claiming an \\"ongoing difference of opinions\\" with other members. For tour dates the following year, the remaining four members were joined by Hanna's son Jaime on guitar and vocals, and Ross Holmes on fiddle, mandolin and vocals.

Designed by V.I. Kozlov and L.A. Petrova, the church was established in 2008 when construction began and was completed in 2015. Construction Development for the church began in 2007, as part of a project by the Russian Orthodox Church to build 200 new worship centers in the Moscow region in the coming decade. The Russian Orthodox hierarchy claimed that in Yasenevo there were 180,000 practicing Orthodox Christians yet only 4 churches in the immediate area. The church was designed by V. I. Kozlov and L.a. Petrova, and the church was officially established in 2008. Construction continued for the next seven years. The construction started even though not all the cost to build the church had yet been covered by sponsors and donors. In 2014, despite not being yet completed, the church won the competition called \\"The Best Implemented Project in the Field of Investments and Construction\\", in the nomination \\"Religious Buildings\\" for churches in the Moscow Oblast. The design of the church combined old Russian and Byzantine traditional architecture of the 11th-12th centuries.

She currently serves as the Knight Chair in Journalism and Digital Media Economics at the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Education Abernathy received a bachelor's degree in history with a secondary emphasis in English literature and journalism from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1972. She earned her M.B.A. from Columbia University in 1985. In 2003, Abernathy completed her master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. Career Between 1969 and 1984, she worked as a reporter or editor at various newspapers such as The Charlotte Observer, The Dallas Times-Herald, and The Wichita Eagle-Beacon. From 1986 to 1999, Abernathy held several positions with The New York Times. She was the senior vice-president strategic planning and human resources, which made her responsible for planning a number of major business initiatives that included the nationwide distribution expansion that began in 1997. Abernathy was also president of the News Services Division, where she created a new media division. Abernathy was a publisher for the Harvard Business Review between 1999 and 2002. In 2004, Abernathy was promoted to a Senior Vice-President at The Wall Street Journal and was responsible for the business operations of the newspaper's international publications. Abernathy is currently the Knight Chair in Journalism and Digital Media Economics at the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Research  Abernathy's research has been devoted to the impact of news deserts and developing business models that would help to sustain community journalism. In Abernathy's report, “The Expanding News Desert” she explored the decline of local newspapers, the implications for communities and democracy, and how to stop the rise of news deserts. Abernathy also examined how ownership of newspapers throughout the nation has changed as many of them have been purchased by investment groups. The report explores how this change has occurred and what this means for accountability and transparency. Lastly, the report examines how the rise of news deserts, along with an increase in investment groups owning newspapers, has impacted community journalism Some of the major trends the report highlighted include: a willingness to sell or close under-performing newspapers, establishment of an annual target for profit margin, a blurred line between the local newspapers’ responsibility to readers and advertisers, increased willingness to declare bankruptcy, and a lack of commitment to the historically served communities. Publications In 2009, Abernathy co-authored “The News Landscape in 2014: Transformed or Diminished?,” which was a report that analyzes the economic situation of news organizations from the perspective of shareholders, journalists and economists. “Saving Community Journalism: The Path to Profitability” was published in 2014. The book was based on five years of research involving more than two dozen newspapers, and it was designed to help stakeholders implement new strategies for long-term profitability. The research in this book became the foundation for the UNC Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. Abernathy co-authored “The Strategic Digital Media Entrepreneur,” published in 2018, which focused on how the Internet has changed business models in the media; leadership challenges and opportunities that face media entrepreneurs; and help to develop strategies to create new and sustainable business models. “The rise of a New Media Baron and the Emerging Threat of News Deserts” was published in 2016. The report shows the significant political, social, and economic consequences of the emergence of news deserts across the United States.

In the medieval period, it served as Iraq's principal commercial port for trade with India. Location al-Basrah, on a map of 9th-century Iraq (lower Mesopotamia) Al-Ubulla was situated on the right bank of the Euphrates–Tigris estuary at the opening into the Persian Gulf. It was located to the east of old Basra and lay on the northern side of the eponymous canal, the Nahr al-Ubulla, which connected Basra southeastwards to the Tigris river, Abadan (in modern Iran) and ultimately to the Persian Gulf. The 'Ashar neighborhood of modern Basra currently occupies the site of al-Ubulla. History Al-Ubulla is identified with the ancient city of Apologos mentioned in the Greek manuscript Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The city dates at least to the Sasanian era (3rd–7th centuries CE), and possibly before. According to the 10th-century chronicler Eutychius of Alexandria, it was founded by the Sasanian emperor Ardashir I (). Toward the end of the Sasanian period, it typically formed part of the territories of the Empire's al-Hira-based Lakhmid vassals. During the early Muslim conquests in the 630s, al-Ubulla was conquered by the Arab forces of Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini after the defeat of its 500-man Sasanian garrison. In a letter attributed to Utba, he describes the city as the \\"port of al-Bahrayn (eastern Arabia), Uman, al- Hind (India) and al-Sin (China)\\". Following the foundation of the Arab garrison town of Basra further inland, al-Ubulla declined in strategic importance but remained a major trade port until the Mongol invasion. As indicated by the medieval Arabic geographers, al-Ubulla continued to be a large town, more populous than Basra, throughout the Abbasid era (750–1258). Yaqut al-Hamawi praised the city and Ibn Hawqal describes the border lands of the Nahr al-Ubulla as a single extensive garden. Al-Ubulla supplied Basra with fresh water and was noted for its linens and shipbuilding. In 942, the governor of Uman captured the city on his way to Basra during his conflict with its strongman Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi and his brother Abu Abdallah al- Baridi. According to the historian J. H. Kramers, the events of its occupation demonstrate its weakness as \\"a bulwark for that city [Basra]\\". The 13th- century Mongol invasions brought about a decline of several places in this part of Iraq, including al-Ubulla.

By early November 1941 the regiment had received the following battalions raised by other regiments: * 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Pordenone ** X Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" (M14/41 tanks, from the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment) ** XI Tank Battalion \\"M13/40\\" (M13/40 tanks, from the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment) ** XII Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" (M14/41 tanks, from the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment On 27 November 1941 the 133rd regiment entered the 133rd Armored Division \\"Littorio\\", while the 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment left the division on the same date. In January 1942 the \\"Littorio\\" was sent to Libya to bolster Axis forces under pressure from the British Operation Crusader. Enroute one transport carrying the tanks for one of the companies of the XII battalion was sunk by British warplanes in the Mediterranean. After the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment had arrived in Libya it had to cede the X battalion to the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment of the 132nd Armored Division \\"Ariete\\" and the XI battalion to the 101st Motorized Division \\"Trieste\\" to replace the losses suffered by the two divisions during Operation Crusader. To bring the 133rd regiment back up to strength 31st Tank Infantry Regiment sent its IV and LI tank battalions to North Africa. At the same time replacements for the lost tanks of the XII battalions were sent to North Africa and so the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment began its move to the front on 31 May 1942 with the following structure: * 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment ** IV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" (M14/41 tanks) ** XII Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" (M14/41 tanks) ** LI Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" (M14/41 tanks) The regiment had its baptism of fire on 20 June 1942 during the Axis capture of Tobruk. From then on the regiment participated in all the battles of the campaign: Battle of Mersa Matruh, First Battle of El Alamein, and Battle of Alam el Halfa. The regiment, like the Littorio division, was destroyed during the Second Battle of El Alamein. Its remnants were grouped with the remnants of the Ariete division in the \\"Cantaluppi\\" Group, an ad-hoc formation commanded by Colonel Gaetano Cantaluppi, and on 20 November 1942 the regiment was declared lost.  Cold War  On 10 July 1948 the Italian Army raised the 1st Tankers Regiment, which inherited the flag and traditions of the 1st Tank Infantry Regiment. The regiment fielded the I and II tanks battalions and on 1 April 1949 the regiment was renamed 132nd Tankers Regiment \\"Ariete\\". In 1954 the regiment raised the III Tank Battalion, which on 5 January 1959 was renamed X Tank Battalion.  10th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Bruno\\"  During the 1975 army reform the 132nd Tank Regiment was disbanded and on 1 November 1975 the X Tank Battalion became the 10th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Bruno\\", which received the war flag and traditions of the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment. The battalion's number commemorated the X Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had served with the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment during the Western Desert Campaign. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 10th Tank Battalion's name commemorated X Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment Second lieutenant Pietro Bruno, who was killed in action on 4 November 1932 during the Second Battle of El Alamein. Based in Aviano and equipped with M60A1 Patton tanks the battalion joined the Armored Brigade \\"Manin\\". The 10th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Bruno\\" was disbanded on 10 January 1991 and the war flag of the 133rd Tank Regiment was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome. However the war flag left the shrine once more and on 17 October 1992 the 60th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Locatelli\\" of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\" was renamed 133rd Tank Regiment. On 9 October 1995 the 31st Tank Regiment of the Armored Brigade \\"Centauro\\" was renamed 4th Tank Regiment and the war flag and name of the 31st were transferred to the 133rd Tank Regiment in Altamura, while on the same day the war flag of the 133rd Tank Regiment was transferred to the army's Tank School in Lecce, where it was stored in the commander's office, until, in case of war, the personnel of the Tank School would have formed the 133rd Tank Regiment. In fall 2001 the 133rd Tank Regiment was disbanded and its war flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

She works on organic and magnetically coupled molecular materials for spintronic applications. In 2008 Heutz was awarded the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Silver Medal.  Early life and education  Heutz studied chemistry at the University of Liège. She moved to Imperial College London for her doctoral studies, where she worked on thin film heterostructures. During her doctoral research Heutz worked with Dietrich Zahn at Chemnitz University of Technology.  Research and career  After earning her PhD degree Heutz worked as a postdoctoral research fellow on solar cells at Imperial College London. She moved to University College London in 2004, where she started work on magnetic biosensors. Heutz joined Imperial College London in 2007 as a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin research fellow. Heutz specialises in the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to monitor unpaired electrons within materials. She used EPR to monitor spins within copper phthalocyanine solar cells. Whilst working on new materials for photovoltaics, Heutz showed that electrons in copper phthalocyanine (a blue pigment found in a Bank of England £5 note) exist in a superposition of two different spin states. She demonstrated that copper phthalocyanine could be used for quantum computing, where information is stored as qubits as opposed to binary bits. Heutz has continued to work on room temperature magnetic organic materials for spintronic applications, working with Nic Harrison, the co-Director of the Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. Together they have explored new approaches to grow phthalocyanine thin films with desired structural and spectroscopic properties. She has shown that at low temperatures (100 K) cobalt phthalocyanine forms molecular structures with strong magnetic alignment. Heutz and her research group have developed flexible thin films of cobalt phthalocyanine for use in spintronic devices. Harrison contributed theoretical models of cobalt phthalocyanine, and demonstrated that by manipulating the angle between adjacent layers of cobalt phthalocyanine it is possible to improve the magnetic properties of the material. This finding explains how cobalt phthalocyanine demonstrates magnetic properties above liquid nitrogen temperatures. In 2018 Heutz demonstrated that pentacene could undergo singlet fission – absorbing a single photon could result in the generation of two excited electrons. She demonstrated that the molecular orientation of pentacene within a solar cell could increase the power output. Pentacene packs in a herringbone structure and each molecule can either be parallel or titled with respect to its neighbours. Heutz and colleagues demonstrated that when pentacene molecules are tilted toward each other they are more likely to undergo singlet fission than when they are tilted. The work was the first to show that pentacene could undergo singlet fission at room temperature.In 2017 Heutz was awarded a multi-million pound research grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to open the UK's first SPIN- Lab. Heutz was promoted to Professor in 2019. She has appeared on the podcast Scientists Not the Science. Heutz is a member of the London Centre for Nanotechnology and the Henry Royce Institute at the University of Manchester.  Selected publications  Her publications include; * Using Self‐Assembling Dipole Molecules to Improve Hole Injection in Conjugated Polymers * Potential for spin-based information processing in a thin-film molecular semiconductor * Molecular Thin Films: A New Type of Magnetic Switch Awards and honours Heutz was awarded the 2008 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) silver medal for her research on organic thin films. In particular she had developed new electron - donor morphologies for efficient solar cells. Heutz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC) in 2018.

It was restored to flight, with improvements, in 2003. Design and development Roman Orliński began to design the Orlik in the spring of 1984. Its first flight was made on 22 February 1987. It has a two part, low, rectangular plan, wooden wing set with 5° of dihedral and built around a single main spar. Plywood skin ahead of the spar around the leading edge forms a torsion-resistant D-box; behind the spar the wing is fabric covered. Its ailerons, mounted on an auxiliary spar, fill a little under half the span. The forward fuselage has a welded steel-tube structure but the rear is a wooden monocoque; throughout, the section is essentially rectangular with rounded decking. Behind the metal-covered, conventionally mounted engine, a Walter Mikron III salvaged from an earlier project, the forward fuselage is ply covered. The cockpit is over the wing, normally enclosed by a two-part canopy though it can be flown open with only its windscreen in place. The Orlik's tail is conventional and angular, its tall, trapezoidal profile fin carrying a similarly shaped, balanced and tabbed rudder. Its rectangular plan tailplane is mounted on the top of the extreme rear fuselage, placing its straight-edged, tapered, one-piece, tabbed elevator behind the rudder. The rudder is entirely fabric-covered and the elevator largely so. The landing gear is conventional and fixed, with steel tube, V-strut main legs hinged from the lower fuselage longerons. Each leg is cross-linked to the top of the other with a steel rod and has an elastic shock absorber within the fuselage. Originally the rather small wheels were exposed. The castoring tailwheel was on a long, trailing spring. The Orlik proved to be easy and pleasant to fly. Criticisms were confined to its landing limitations; the absence of flaps meant a shallow approach, the absence of brakes could be a problem at short strips and its small wheels did not suit rough surfaces. After a period of disuse the Orlik was quickly restored to flight in mid-2003. Photographs from that year show the wheels enclosed in spats and flaps which occupy all the trailing edge inboard of the aileron. It underwent a series of quantitative tests with results good enough to encourage Orliński's son to start a second airframe in 2004. It is not known if this was completed. Operational history Five months after its first flight in 1987 the Orlik appeared in public for the first time at the 6th Amateur Constructors' Rally. It made a good impression and took one of the two first prizes. After restoration and tests in 2003, it flew in public at an Air Force open day in September 2010.

Newall and distributed by Rusty Quill. Sims narrates the podcast in-character as the main character, Jonathan Sims, the newly- appointed head archivist of the fictional Magnus Institute—an institution based in London centered on research into the paranormal. In 2018, BBC Sounds listed the show as one of the largest British dramatic podcasts, with an extensive fanbase on Tumblr having driven much of its success. As of April 2020, The Magnus Archives has reached a download rate of over 2.5 million downloads a month. The shows audience had grown to over 4 million downloads a month by July 23rd 2020 according to a press release first appearing on Podnews.net.  Production  The podcast is structured as a series of statements recorded or written and then recorded for internal research use within the Magnus Institute. At the beginning of each statement, the statement-taker (mainly Jon, the head archivist) provides a brief description of the statement and the name of the statement-maker. Those who give or record statements in the Magnus Institute tend to lapse into a trance-like state not unlike reliving the event.  Cast and characters   Main cast  * Jonathan Sims as Jonathan \\"John\\" Sims, the head archivist at the Magnus Institute, a title with which he announces himself at the beginning of each statement he records. He is described as ‘prematurely greying’ and ‘looking older than he is’ in “A Guest for Mr. Spider”, and he has many scars incurred from the hazards of his job. In conversation he is often rude and short- tempered at first, but meets kindness with kindness. After the events of \\"Eye Contact\\", John refers to himself only as ‘The Archivist’, having undergone a significant change. As of \\"Dwelling\\" and perhaps before, he is in a romantic relationship with Martin Blackwood. He is asexual. * Alexander J Newall as Martin Blackwood, an archival assistant at the Magnus Institute who obtained his job by lying about holding a degree in parapsychology. In \\"Colony\\" he is described as 'not exactly the smallest guy in the world' and in \\"The Masquerade\\" it is revealed that he looks exactly like his father. He is soft- spoken and generally gravitates away from social gatherings. As of \\"Dwelling\\" and perhaps before, he is in a romantic relationship with Jonathan Sims. * Lottie Broomhall as Sasha James, an archival assistant at the Magnus Institute, mainly locating records that could set standard of proof for statements. She is described as tall and having long hair and glasses. In \\"Human Remains\\" she is replaced with by an entity known as 'Not-Sasha', which wears her identity with a different body. * Mike LeBeau as Timothy \\"Tim\\" Stoker, an archival assistant at the Magnus Institute. He assumed the role when John was promoted to head archivist, having worked with him previously in the research department. He is continually described as being exceptionally attractive. He has been in relationships with men and women, as revealed in \\"Across the Street\\" when he courts two file clerks. At first, he is kind and cocksure, but comes to resent his position within the Institute, becoming more cynical and angry in interactions with his coworkers, mainly John. * Ben Meredith as Elias Bouchard, the Head of the Magnus Institute. The only notable visual description given has been his own assertion of having 'only two eyes'. He is initially dismissive of the concerns surrounding active paranormal activity within the Institute, but is quick to reveal some degree of intentionally withheld information when confronted. * Evelyn Hewitt as Not- Sasha, a paranormal entity that wears Sasha James' identity. It lives in the tunnels under the Institute when not performing administrative tasks, and has a significant role in drawing John's attention to the paranormal happenings within the Institute's walls. It has issues with using technology. * Sue Sims as Gertrude Robinson, the previous head archivist at the Magnus Institute. She was replaced by Jonathan Sims after going missing in March 2015. She is described as being 'in her fifties or sixties with reading glasses and grey hair in a tight bun'. She appears in some episodes in past recordings of statements as John and the other assistants work to understand her role at the Institute. Her demeanor is brusque and she is very serious about her work. * Frank Voss as Basira Hussain, an officer sectioned to work on 'weird' cases through Section 31. She becomes involved in an investigation surrounding a death in the Institute in \\"Section 31\\", and is quickly entangled in the Institute's mysterious happenings. * Fay Roberts as Alice \\"Daisy\\" Tonner, a detective also sectioned to work on 'weird' cases through Section 31. * Lydia Nicholas as Melanie King, the former host of the YouTube series Ghost Hunt UK. After some strange supernatural incidents, she comes to be employed by the Magnus Institute. * Sasha Sienna as Georgie Barker, the fearless host of the What The Ghost? podcast. She lives with her cat, The Admiral, and knew Jonathan Sims in university. * Alasdair Stuart as Peter Lukas, Captain of the Tundra and member of the Lukas Family, acting as the antagonist and temporary Institute Head in Season 4.  Recurring cast  * Jon Gracey as Gerard Keay, the son of Mary Keay who works alongside Gertrude Robinson after she frees him from his mother. * Paul Sims as Jurgen Leitner, a collector of books affected by the paranormal forces the Institute researches. He went into hiding in 1994 after his library was burned down, and resided in the tunnels underneath of the Institute until his death in \\"The Librarian\\". * Luke Booys as Michael, a manifestation of a paranormal power. Its appearance is flexible, but its base humanoid version is that of Gertrude Robinson's assistant, Michael Shelley, who was a tall man with straw blonde hair and a round face. It was bound to Michael as a part of a ritual. Its distorted version, the same appearance but thin and limp with hands as large as its torso, can be seen in mirrors. It both resides in and is a realm accessible only by a door of its own conjuring. It preys on people by luring them into its door and trapping them within an inescapable labyrinth. It was killed by and became Helen in \\"Another Twist\\". * Hannah Brankin as Jane Prentiss, a previously ordinary woman turned into a living hive for silver worms after finding a wasps nest in her attic. She would often infect others, having the worms bury into their flesh, either killing them or turning them into hives. She was killed in the archives and cremated soon after. * Imogen Harris as Helen Richardson, a manifestation of paranormal power replacing Michael, who occasionally assists and disrupts the Archive's activities. * Guy Kelly as Michael Crew, avatar of a paranormal force who meets Jonathan Sims in \\"The Coming Storm\\". * Jessica Law as Nikola Orsinov, a plastic mannequin who was originally Joseph Grimaldi. Serves a paranormal power which she attempts, and fails, to summon in \\"Stranger and Stranger\\". * Hannah Walker as Jude Perry, a member of The Cult of the Lightless Flame, a group dedicated to destruction and suffering, who encounters Jonathan Sims in \\"Twice as Bright\\". * Russell Smith as Oliver Banks, an entity of death able to see people's life force in the form of red veins.  Plot  From the official website of the Magnus Archives The podcast is initially presented as a horror anthology but slowly reveals a more complex metaplot over the course of 5 seasons.  Season 1  Season 1 of the Magnus Archives ran from March 24, 2016 to October 13, 2016. The eponymous Jonathan Sims is installed as the new Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute's Archives, his predecessor Gertrude Robinson seemingly presumed dead. As he attempts to digitize the supernatural statements, he finds that some statements can only be recorded on tape recorder as opposed to the preferred digital recordings. Among these statements are mentions of paranormal books he calls \\"Leitners\\" because many of them seem to originate from a library that had belonged to a man called Jurgen Leitner. He also records statements live from subjects, including Melanie King, a paranormal investigator who hosts a YouTube series called Ghost Hunt UK. Initially John is skeptical of the supernatural happenings detailed within each statement but eventually he begins to uncover connections between the statements suggesting that the dark forces and horrors described within them are real. Over the course of each recording, various characters make incidental appearances to speak to John, such as the Institute Head Elias Bouchard and the archival staff, Martin Blackwood, Tim Stoker, and Sasha James. In one particular episode, Sasha herself makes a statement regarding a supernatural being called Michael that seems at least slightly more benevolent than other supernatural beings that are mentioned. In particular, a woman named Jane Prentiss, a former New Age shop assistant, has become the host for a mass of parasitic worms that seem intent on attacking members of the archival staff, particularly attacking Martin, and, eventually, attacking the Archives itself. In the chaos of Prentiss' final attack, Sasha dies at the hands of another supernatural being, but her death goes unnoticed as the supernatural being replaces her and assumes her identity. The body of Gertrude Robinson, the former Archive Head, is also found in one of the tunnels beneath the Institute, three bullet wounds in her chest. Notable Episodes: * MAG - 1 - Angler Fish - Show debut streamed millions of times.  Season 2  Season 2 of the Magnus Archives ran from December 1, 2016, to August 31, 2017. In the aftermath of Prentiss' attack and subsequent death, John finds himself with a growing sense of paranoia. John is convinced that there is a greater conspiracy behind the murder of his predecessor Gertrude Robinson, and he works alongside the police to investigate, most notably from Constable Basira Hussain. John also begins to explore the tunnels beneath the Archives, convinced that someone is down there. The other archival staff begin to worry for both John's safety and sanity, to which John only responds with suspicion. As John continues to distrust and investigate his coworkers, to the point of stalking and breaching of privacy, his archival assistants become more aggravated, Tim in particular though Martin shows more concern for John. After taking a live statement from a woman named Helen Richardson, a real estate agent who claimed to be terrorized by a supernatural being, John finds himself confronted by the supernatural being in question, Michael. Michael implies that there are much greater forces at work and states that Sasha is \\"lying to him\\" before leaving and taking Helen with him. John continues his investigation of the tunnels and finds evidence of Sasha and an old man he's never seen before going into the tunnels. Later, Melanie returns to the Institute, stating that her YouTube crew has disbanded. She and John argue that the woman John knows as Sasha is actually \\"not Sasha\\". This eventually raises John's suspicions and he finds more statements connecting a strange being called the \\"NotThem\\" that can replace people and a strange table that is sitting in the Institute's artefact storage. He decides to take immediate action and destroy the table, but the creature impersonating Sasha explains that the table was actually \\"binding\\" them and then they directly attack John in their more monstrous form. John is eventually saved by the mysterious old man who'd been in and out of the tunnels: Jurgen Leitner, the previous owner of the library of paranormal books in various statements. In John's office, Leitner explains he'd been hiding in the tunnels since the destruction of his library in 1994, evading various monsters and people who sought to do him harm. He then explains his understanding of the entities behind the books (and creatures such as \\"Michael\\" and the \\"NotThem\\"): that they are manifestations of vast, powerful entities based on primal fears that exist just outside of human perception. He also relates that he believes that the Institute's Head, Elias, is the one who killed Gertrude, who Leitner had been working with to destroy the Institute, itself a place of power for one of the entities known as The Eye. John steps out, overwhelmed with these revelations, at which point, Elias himself steps in, surprised but pleased to discover with whom Gertrude had been working. Elias then murders Leitner brutally with a metal pipe and leaves, not wanting to leave any loose ends. When John returns, he immediately flees from the bloody scene. The body is then discovered by Tim and Martin. Notable Episodes: * MAG - 43 - Section 31 — A fan favorite * MAG - 47 - A New Door  Season 3  Season 3 of the Magnus Archives ran from November 23, 2017, to September 27, 2018. John is a now a wanted man, a person of interest not only as a suspect in the murder of his predecessor, but also in the murder of Jurgen Leitner (although the police cannot actually identify him). Tim and Martin struggle to hold themselves together following the disappearance of their friend Sasha. The newly hired Melanie is acting increasingly erratic, and it is beginning to dawn on the whole team that they are all far too involved with the Archives to leave now, if they ever or even could. As a wanted man, John goes from hiding with his friends, to being kidnapped by a sinister circus, to traveling the world trying to piece together what information his predecessor had put together on the mysterious ritual of \\"Unknowing\\"... Notable Episodes: * MAG - 81 - A Guest For Mister Spider — A statement from the Archivist's own childhood * MAG - 92 - Nothing Beside Remains  Season 4  Season 4 of the Magnus Archives ran from January 10, 2019, to October 31, 2019. The Archivist awakes in the aftermath of the Unknowing to find a changed team. As the Archivist makes ever-greater sacrifices in the name of knowledge and those left behind, he finds himself concerned about Martin and his relationship with the strange new acting head of the Institute. More is changing than just relationships within the archival team - Martin is convinced that a new power is coalescing. One which, if it gets its way, could spell the end of the world. Notable Episodes: * MAG - 158 - Panopticon — Accompanied by a post- season special episode titled Building The Panopticon - The Making of Mag 158 * MAG - 160 - The Eye Opens — Generated significant press, including The Podcast Dragon, SYFYWIRE, and Sueddeutsche Zeitung  Season 5  Season 5 debuted April 1, 2020, with excitement around the first episode rumored to be so large that a sudden influx of traffic on its release crashed Patreon. The Archivist has changed. Martin is still by his side. They must come to grips with their horrifying new reality. Season 5 will be split into three acts.  Critical reception  The Magnus Archives has been praised by critics and reviewers. The development of the lengthy metaplot and the voice acting by Jonathan Sims in his role as the archivist Jonathan Sims received particular praise.

It is the first of several compilation Tom and Jerry shorts, integrating footage from previous shorts into the plot. Summary Tom places a bunch of traps in front of Jerry's mouse hole. He raises a cleaver over the hole but is immediately stopped by a talking radio. The announcer, Uncle Dudley, tells him it is \\"Be Kind To Animals\\" week. Tom removes the traps he just set up and returns with flowers, a present, and a pie with, \\"To Jerry with Love\\" on it. Tom knocks on the wall but Jerry is not there. Tom removes the grate on the wall and sees that Jerry is not at home. But he does see his diary. Tom reaches in, grabs it, and starts to read it. The first entry dates on Sunday, April 5, when Tom used Jerry as a Tee when he played golf. This segues into two scenes from 1945's Tee for Two. In the first scene Tom uses Jerry as a tee, then puts Jerry through the ball cleaner. Tom is laughing while reminiscing this scene. He continues to read the next part of the entry, where he hits the ball and grins, only for it to bounce off a tree and smash his teeth. Because of this entry, Tom's mood immediately goes down and he turns to another entry. The next entry dates on Thursday, May 12, when Jerry got curious about Tom and it almost got him caught. This changes to a scene from 1944's Mouse Trouble, where Tom attempts to catch Jerry by raising the mouse's curiosity. Tom succeeds and catches him, but Jerry pulls the same trick on him with his fists. Tom inspects them only to get punched in the eye. Tom gets angry from what he has read and throws away the flowers in irritation. He turns to another entry which dates on Monday, June 3, when Jerry got Tom into two nasty surprises in a chase. The scene changes to 1946's Solid Serenade, where both of them bring their chase from outdoors into the kitchen. The chase ends with a window falling on Tom's neck causing him to shriek in pain. Tom is now enraged at what Jerry has written about him and he destroys Jerry's present (which appears to be a box of chocolates) in frustration. He is just about to throw the diary away when he opens it again and reads one more entry dating Saturday, July 4, when Tom and Jerry fought using firecrackers. The scene changes to 1943's The Yankee Doodle Mouse, where Tom throws dynamite towards Jerry, but Jerry immediately throws it back; the mouse uses reverse psychology to make Tom grab the dynamite for himself, which explodes. Tom then traps Jerry inside a kettle and throws in a stick of dynamite. The mouse escapes as no explosion occurs. The puzzled cat opens the kettle's lid, after which the firecracker goes off, leaving him resembling a blackface sunflower. Tom has finally had it and rips Jerry's diary to pieces in exasperation just as soon as the mouse comes home. He is happy to see that Tom has baked him a pie. Jerry points at the pie and then points to himself, asking if the pie is for him. Tom is just about to strangle Jerry when Uncle Dudley, via the radio, stops him once again. \\"And now before your old Uncle Dudley says goodbye, did you get a nice little surprise for your little animal friend?\\" Tom picks up the pie with a devilish smile. The radio says, \\"You did? Well, let him have it.\\" And Tom does - by throwing the pie at the mouse. Jerry, who looks rather dazed, looks into the camera and shrugs his shoulders.

Biography Although Augustine's sister is mentioned by him and Possidius, neither give her name; the Bollandists ascribe the name Perpetua to sacred tradition.Cited in Perpetua married and was widowed, then dedicated herself to a life of celibacy and became head of a convent. She died around 423. In his writings, Augustine does name their brother, Navigus. Possidius describes her in his Vita Augustini as \\"superior of the handmaids until her death\\", despite this, neither she, nor any other woman, was allowed to stay at Augustine's monastery. He argued that although his sister, who was living a holy life, would be above \\"evil suspicion\\" - she would need to bring in female servants who may provide temptation.  Religious impact  Perpetua was an abbess of an order of consecrated virgins in Hippo. This monastery was probably close to his own in Hippo. Augustine and Perpetuas' nieces joined this religious foundation. The monastery was also well-known for rescuing foundlings. This establishment seems to have run on similar lines to his - the nuns were allowed to leave the monastery for a variety of activities, including: visiting the baths, to the laundry, and to worship at external churches. He wrote Epistula 211 addressed to the order, after the death of his sister, as they were suffering from internal dissent. It can be argued that Perpetuas' influence was at its strongest after her death, with the writing of this letter to her community. It became known as the Rule of Nuns. One of its major warnings was of pride: whether you came from a humble or a rich background, there was danger that you may become proud of your asceticism, which undid all its holy work.

Host and symptoms Puccinia sorghi often first appears after silking in maize. The first early symptom includes chlorotic specks on the leaf. The obvious sign of this plant pathogen is golden-brown pustules or bumps on the above-ground surface of the plant tissue. These bumps are urediniospores which can spread to other plants and cause further infection. They are circular and powdery, which result from spores breaking through the leaf surface. While they are only about 1-2 mm each, they are very numerous with equal frequencies on upper and lower leaf surfaces. Overtime, these blister-like bumps can change from brown to black, changing from urediniospores to teliospores. The most common place to find these spores is on the plant leaf, but they can develop on husks, tassels, and stalks as well. P. sorghi has two hosts making it a heteroecious rust. Maize and Oxalis are the two hosts for P. sorghi. In comparison, the other common type of maize rust is southern corn rust (Puccinia polysora) and it has a higher variety of hosts including maize, silver plumegrass, eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum lanceolatum, T. laxum, and T. pilorum. Disease cycle There are five spore stages in P. sorghi. The spore types are teliospores, basidiospores, pycniospores, aeciospores, and urediniospores. Every year, viable urediniospores must travel to the north from the warmer southern climate. Since P. sorghi is an obligate parasite, it requires living plant tissue in order to survive. Therefore, this disease cannot overwinter in northern US states. The severity of the disease depends largely on weather conditions and how many spores are carried north each season. Urediniospores infect leaves and produce more spores to create a secondary inoculum and polycyclic disease cycle. Once the urediniospores mature on the plant tissue and turn black they become teliospores. Urediniospores measure 22-33 × 20-28 µm. Teliospores are two-celled and measure 27-53 µm. Teliospores overwinter in the southern climate and germinate in the spring. Teliospores produce basidiospores which spread by wind to infect Oxalis. They infect Oxalis and produce sexual spores (pycniospores) and aeciospores. Aeciospores are windblown to maize and infect the plant. Management The use of resistant maize hybrids is the best way to manage P. sorghi. There are two types of resistance that exist. The first is partial resistance which results in fewer rust spots by reducing germination rate. This type of resistance makes P. sorghi less severe by slowing down development of number of urediniospores. The other type of resistance is qualitative. This type relies on a single gene which provides total resistance to the plant. Other management tactics include foliar application of fungicide and cultural control. For fungicide application, plants should be monitored throughout the season, spraying when there are six or more pustules per leaf. Fungicide groups that can be used include mixed modes of action, DMI Triazoles (Group 3), and Qol Strobilurins (Group 11). Cultural control can be more effective in areas where the spores can overwinter. Debris should be collected and destroyed by burning along with eradication of Oxalis in surrounding areas. In northern areas where the spores can’t overwinter, early planting time can help avoid P. sorghi. Younger leaves are more susceptible to infection, by planting earlier the crop will be more mature and more resilient by the time the spores arrive.

Anderson was nicknamed \\"the culture minister\\" due to his role in organising cultural events and promoting young artists. In 1991, it was revealed that he had been an informal collaborator for the East German Stasi since 1975. Anderson was born in Weimar in 1953 to a theatre director/actor father and architect mother. As an adult, he moved to Dresden where he trained as a typesetter and used his skills to print and disseminate political leaflets and poetry, for which he was imprisoned twice, in 1970 and 1972. Anderson's first reports to the Stasi came after his prison sentences. Anderson's code name was Fritz Müller The East German secret police, known as the Stasi, had one of the most extensive and effective intelligence networks to have ever existed. By 1989, it was estimated there were at least 189000 informants in every sphere of East German society, and files on millions of citizens. By the late 1970s, the Stasi had moved from overt persecution to a programme of psychological harassment known as Zersetzung. The goal was the \\"fragmentation, paralysis, disorganization, and isolation of the hostile and negative forces, in order to preventatively impede the hostile and negative activities\\" of political opponents.  Move to Berlin  In the 1960s Prenzlauer Berg had become a home to East German artists, intellectuals and the gay community; in the 1970s and 80s, the district was known as a \\"legendary Bohemia\\" which attracted artists like Cornelia Schleime and poets Adolf Endler and Bert Papenfuß-Gorek. In 1976 Wolf Biermann, a prominent singer-songwriter in the scene, had his citizenship revoked while on a tour of West Germany; another member, philosopher Rudolf Bahro, was arrested and imprisoned in 1977 after he admitted having written The Alternative, a critique of East German socialism. These events triggered a wave of emigration in the counter-culture scene, and left what the ceramicist Wilfriede Maaß described as a \\"deep void\\". Anderson moved from Dresden to Berlin in 1981, and based himself in the Prenzlauer Berg district. He has been described by those who knew him as \\"fascinating\\", \\"charismatic\\" and \\"an idol\\"; he immersed himself in the East Berlin alternative scene, became a singer in a punk band, and quickly gained a reputation as an organiser of cultural events. He arranged for the screening of films and publication of books and magazines, and found spaces for artists to work, perform and exhibit. For some time, he lived with Ekkehard and Wilfriede Maaß and their apartment and workshop became a meeting place for artists and bohemians. Ekkehard and Anderson held readings and exhibitions in their home, and it became a literary salon, attended by Heiner Müller, Christa Wolf, Volker Braun and Franz Fühmann. Allen Ginsberg and Yevgeny Yevtushenko also visited; it has been speculated that the well- known participants may have protected the gatherings from being persecuted by the Stasi. In 1986, Anderson emigrated to West Germany, but continued organise cultural events in the East, and to report to the Stasi. While in West Berlin, he worked as a private secretary for A. R. Penck. Six months after he moved to the West, the Stasi opened a file on Anderson and may have been under surveillance even earlier. In 1989, protests in East Germany culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall. In a documentary in 2009, Anderson said, \\"It was incredibly exciting...it never crossed my mind that I was with the Stasi. I was there very quickly, standing on top of the wall. It was a beautiful feeling and I wanted to be part of it. I couldn’t stand by and watch it from afar.\\" A friend recalls that Anderson swore at the sight of the open wall, although Anderson says he does not recall this.  Exposure as an informant  In 1991, singer-wongwriter Wolf Biermann was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize. During his acceptance speech, he made reference to a number of Stasi spies, including \\"the untalented babbler Sascha Arschloch [asshole]... who is still playing cool and hoping his files won't show up\\". The announcement caused immediate outcry amongst Anderson's friends and supporters; when asked by Schleime and Endler, he had repeatedly denied working as a spy. The information provided to the Stasi by Anderson included \\"accurate and detailed psychograms of all artist friends\\" \\"No critical word, no rebellious eye, no precarious love had escaped\\" from the reports. He organised events, and then reported on them to the police. He also wrote about himself in his reports: in 1986, he wrote to the Stasi: \\"Sometimes I had the feeling that I am being paid to monitor myself\\". His reports were \\"precisely articulated and contained incriminating evidence against his fellow writers\\". In interviews, Anderson has given a number of reasons for becoming an informant. In 2009, speaking in a documentary he answered: > How did you decide to be a spy? In that situation someone comes and wants > something from you and if you’re egotistical and altruistic enough then you > say “Okay, let’s do it. I’ll do what I can and you’ll do what you can”. > That’s fine. I’m not the sort of person who makes decisions based on an > idea, so if the Devil looks good, I might say to him: “How can I help you, > dear Devil?” I sensed they wanted something from me. Someone is taking you > seriously and listening to you. So I offered myself up. Every gap in the > conversation was a chance for me to say: “I am the right man for you” Were > you a good spy? [laughs]In the place that I was, I was the top informer. I > had the feeling that I wasn’t just an ordinary spy. Of course, I told them > everything. He has commented that he wanted to be recruited as a \\"top spy\\" by the KGB and was surprised that he was not approached by them, and has described his relationship with Stasi officers as a father-son one. In another interview, he said \\"To me it's all the same...To me it meant nothing ... I had no moral problems. In 2019, he told another interviewer his motive was antifascism. Before he was revealed as an informant, Anderson had received a number of prizes for his literary works including a residency at the Villa Massimo. Afterwards, he was ostracised by the literary community, and was described as \\"for a time... one of the most reviled men in Germany.\\" When he took up the year-long Villa Massimo residency in 1993, other recipients refused to stay in the accommodation with him, and he ended up moving out of the villa for his stay in Rome. When Annekatrin Hendel's documentary Anderson - Anatomie des Verrats [Anderson - Anatomy of Betrayal] was released in 2014, there were protests at screenings. In 1995 he faced charges relating to his work as an informant. He was acquitted, but received a fine. Since the dissolution of the Stasi in 1990, the Stasi Records Agency has worked to reassemble and organise the records held by the secret police and citizens have the right to request to see their own records. These documents have also been used to identify Stasi agents and informants. In 1999, Anderson's informant file was published He has faced criticism for refusing to apologise or admit guilt for his actions; several critics have remarked that his published works seem to excuse or gloss over his collaboration. The literary scholar Peter Boethig named Anderson as one of the six most active informers of the literary salons held at the Maaß apartment. Since the mid 1990s, he has lived in Frankfurt with the writer and artist Alissa Walser. where he has worked as a freelance typesetter and organised events for an investment bank.  Writing  Anderson has published a number of books of poetry and an autobiographical novel. He is considered one of the most important poets of the German Democratic Republic, but many of his works have not been reprinted due to the controversy surrounding him. His novel, published in 2002, was largely unsuccessful despite being launched in a series of well-attended promotional events. Many reviews were \\"dismissive and openly sarcastic\\" of the book. He has since written under a pseudonym at the request of publishers, as they did not wish to be associated with his name. A review of works re-evaluating GDR culture said that Anderson \\"incarnates everything abject about the East and its literary culture\\" and that Anderson has become \\"the projection of all of the small acts of betrayal and cowardice and accommodation that were required in the east\\".

In the eighties, Jackson denounced the use of the USS Kitty Hawk to sell F-14 parts and missiles to Iran illegally. Later, it was discovered that this ring of smugglers was part of a wider operation involving three different US Navy carriers, and an essential part of a more significant conspiracy, later referred to as the Iran–Contra affair. On October 1, 1985, Jackson testified before the House Sea Power Subcommittee, sharing 2,000 pages of Navy documents that showed evidence of fraud, forgery, and kickbacks aboard the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. The panel was chaired by Rep. Charles Bennet. Testifying along with Jackson were Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Commodore James B. Whittaker, the Navy's assistant commander for inventory and systems integrity. Jackson's accusations crossed path with an open FBI investigation, which arrested seven suspects. These included an aviation storekeeper on the helicopter ship Belleau Wood, two Navy employees, a civilian warehouse worker, and an aviation storekeeper on the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. Other than that, three civilians and an Iranian based in London also were arrested. Besides Kitty Hawk and Belleau Wood, a third aircraft carrier based on the West Coast was also involved. At the time, the case was considered the first time a hostile country has penetrated the Pentagon's supply system. In August 1985, US District Judge Earl B. Gilliam issued a broad gag order to prevent the seven people charged with stealing the F-14 fighter parts from the Navy and smuggling them to Iran from discussing the case. But the gag order was also applied to defense attorneys, federal prosecutors, and potential witnesses, which sealed Jackson's allegations and kept the story hidden from public. Jackson's accusations were later revealed in two different books: Robert Jackson's memoirs, named Running Scared, and a book called The Documents Behind Running Scared.  Early life and Navy career  Jackson was born on March 18, 1959, in Bakersfield, California. He is the fourth child down in an eight-child family. After graduating from Highland High School in 1977, he joined the United States Navy. Jackson served in the US Navy from August 1977 to April 1983, and later from August 1983 to August 1985. Jackson's father, Jim Jackson, was a self-employed petroleum engineer who served three years in the Navy. His mother died of brain cancer in 1980, when Robert was in his early twenties. His first tour of duty was at HSL-36 in Mayport, Florida, as an aviation anti-submarine warfare operator (today's aviation warfare systems operator) and a search and rescue aircrewman (SAR) wet crewman (swimmer). He then went to the Navy Reserves, where he was stationed at Pt. Magu, California, in VP-65. In 1980, after leaving the Navy, Jackson began selling life and health insurance in Jacksonville and at Mutual of Omaha. After a troubled marriage and a divorce that left him broke, he re- enlisted in the US Navy as a third-class petty officer. After advanced training, Jackson was stationed on the , in September 1983. At the time, the USS Kitty Hawk was homeported in San Diego, California. Initially, Jackson was assigned to the Anti-submarine Warfare Module (ASWMOD). One month later, he was given the collateral duty of divisional supply petty officer. After a mess-up in the supply records, Jackson was sent to Supply to learn about the Navy Supply system on his off time. In six months, Jackson had the Navy Supply system down so well he began teaching other divisional supply petty officers, chiefs, and officers. He was awarded a promotion to second-class petty officer before being sent temporarily assigned duties (TAD) to Supply. He was finally sent to the S-1 Financial Office to be the ship's senior Supply & Equipage (S&E;) auditor .  Historical Background: The Iranian Hostage Crisis  Before the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States was the largest seller of arms to Iran under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Because of that, the vast majority of the weapons that the Islamic Republic of Iran inherited in January 1979 were American-made. In November 1979, a group of Iranian college students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line took over the US Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. After an initial release, fifty-two diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days, in what became known as the Iran hostage crisis. The American response was to halt oil export from Iran and freeze Iranian government assets and investments. President Carter ordered a military rescue mission, codenamed Operation Eagle Claw, which was a total failure. In consequence of the hostage crisis, US sanctions were imposed in 1979 by Executive Order 12170. The set of US sanctions included a trade and arms embargo. Part of these sanctions was lifted in January 1981 as part of the Algiers Accords, a set of agreements between the United States and Iran to resolve the Iran hostage crisis. By these accords, the US pledged that it \\"is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran’s internal affairs.\\" In the spring of 1983, the United States launched Operation Staunch, a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran. To all effects, Iran was still considered a hostile country in the 1980s. This arms embargo took place during the Iran-Iraq war (1980–1988), a war in which the US sided with Iraq. On the record. the US could not, and was not, selling any weapons or military equipment to Iran.  The USS Kitty Hawk incident  In September 1983, Petty Officer Jackson reported to the Kitty Hawks antisubmarine warfare division. During his time on board, he became the division's bookkeeper. After several months of intense study, Jackson had the Kitty Hawks arcane bookkeeping system fully deciphered. In his evaluation for June to December 1984, Jackson was given a 4.0 rating, the Navy's highest mark. “Petty Officer Jackson’s high levels of initiative and personal performance,” the Navy report stated, “far exceed those expected of a junior petty officer.” He was given increasing accounting responsibilities until the incident. By late December 1984, he was overseeing more than 250 bookkeepers. Over time, Jackson realized that the carrier's supply system didn't work the way it supposed to, having found evidence of fraud, corruption, theft, and waste. A significant part of the items that were logged on the books either didn't stay aboard very long or never arrived. According to Jackson, he and his colleagues were commonly ordered to fill out “survey forms” wrongfully stating that equipment had been lost or damaged. According to Jackson's allegations, in some cases, the items had been thrown in the middle of the ocean. In one of the incidents reported by Jackson, Kitty Hawk sailors were able to illegally requisition 31 nine-pound silver bars, worth about $535 each. The scam was first discovered by authorities when one of the sailors was caught trying to trade one of those silver bars for drugs. After conducting a full audit on the ship, Petty Officer Jackson found out that more than $1 million worth of military equipment was missing from the USS Kitty Hawk. When he brought that information to his superior officers, he was ignored by his superiors and intimidated by his fellow mates. One of his sailors ended up arrested after threatening to break Jackson \\"into little pieces and throw [him] into the screws of the ship.\\" Later, Jackson presented documents and evidence to the Naval Investigative Service that the missing parts were funneled by an international theft ring that shipped spare parts of F-14 fighter planes to Iran. After providing the names of 30 sailors involved in theft or fraud within the ship's supply system, Jackson was ordered to return to the same ship where the smugglers where serving. Receiving death threats and being ignored by Navy authorities, Jackson decided to blow the whistle and took the case to the press. His story was published in the LA Times by the journalist Glenn F. Bunting (https://www.gfbunting.com/), in a series of pieces printed from July 1985 to February 1986. Initially, the Navy denied the accusations. Like many whistleblowers, Jackson's motivations were publicly questioned, and his integrity was challenged. He was labeled as \\"a zealot\\" and a \\"troublemaker,\\" with news articles smearing his reputation and exposing details about his troubled marriage, religious beliefs, work ethics, and even his high school grades. A -month Navy investigation of incidents on board the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk produced a 12-inch-thick report, where the Navy concluded that \\"$10-million inventory was missing because of accounting errors and computer problems.\\" Nevertheless, the Navy report stated that there was no evidence of \\"fraud, waste or mismanagement.\\" According to People magazine, in July 1985, the Navy announced that it could not account for about $14 million worth of Kitty Hawk supplies. In the end, a Federal investigation revealed the truth about what happened on the USS Kitty Hawk. After Petty Officer Jackson presented 2,000 pages of documents, the FBI arrested seven people involved in the scheme to smuggle Navy F-14 fighter parts and Phoenix missiles to Iran. Following the incident, Petty Officer Jackson quit the Navy in September 1985. On October 1, 1985, he testified before the US Congress with Congressman Jim Bates. Bates presented his findings to a Congressional Subcommittee. He reported that $10 million parts were missing from the USS Kitty Hawk and that another $10 million could not be accounted for, in a total of $20 million. On that occasion, Bates raised the suspicion that an espionage ring was using the USS Kitty Hawk to dispatch F-14 parts to Iran and called it a spy scandal. Bates also stated that the Naval Investigative Service seemed to be doing more covering up than uncovering the problem. In the 1980s, the F-14 aircraft served as the U.S. Navy's primary maritime air superiority fighter. Curiously enough, F-14s were also used as land-based interceptors by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force during the Iran–Iraq War, where they saw combat against Iraqi warplanes. Iranian F-14s reportedly shot down at least 160 Iraqi aircraft during the war, while only 12 to 16 Tomcats were lost. Considering that the US was supposed to be allied with Iraq – and having in mind that it was against the US foreign policy to sell any weapons to Iran at that time – Bates' accusations were pretty serious. During his Congressional testimony, Jackson stated that: > The supply system aboard the Kitty Hawk is in shambles and I don't say the > word because I want to, I say shambles because it is true, what I feel it is > true. What I found was a computer system that was flawed to such an extent > that nobody knew how much money they were actually spending. This is the > core of what I found. There was no training, auditing or reporting program > on the Kitty Hawk for divisional supply petty officers to help them learn > how to audit their checkbooks. That weakness allowed certain people within > the supply system to manipulate the supply's system computer to cover up the > theft's of aircraft and missile parts to Iran. Why did I go to the Congress > and the Senate, to Congressman Hunter and Congressman Bates? You know, I > tried to follow the chain of command. I found out it didn't work. I tried to > disclose what I discovered to the Naval Investigative Service and I found > out they don't work. My life had been threatened and I needed help. Based on a broad gag order issued to prevent the seven people charged with stealing the F-14 fighter parts from the Navy and smuggling them to Iran from discussing the case, Congress decided to seal Jackson's allegations and kept the story hidden from public. Only one year after Jackson's testimony, on November 3, 1986, the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa exposed the existence of a secret agreement between the US Government and the Islamic Republic of Iran to illegally sell weapons to the latter, in what later was known as the Iran- Contra affair. The Iranian government confirmed the Ash-Shiraa story, and, on November 13, President Reagan appeared on national television, stating: > My purpose was ... to send a signal that the United States was prepared to > replace the animosity between [the U.S. and Iran] with a new relationship > ... At the same time we undertook this initiative, we made clear that Iran > must oppose all forms of international terrorism as a condition of progress > in our relationship. The most significant step which Iran could take, we > indicated, would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of > all hostages held there. Nevertheless, the full scope of the operation was more complex than merely selling weapons for hostages. On October 5, 1986, one month before the Ash- Shiraa article, a transport aircraft delivering weapons via clandestine airdrop to the Nicaraguan Contras was shot down over Nicaragua by a surface- to-air missile. Two U.S. pilots – Wallace \\"Buzz\\" Sawyer and William Cooper – were piloting the Corporate Air Services HPF821 and died on the crash. The pilots were transporting weapons into Nicaragua, and the Nicaraguan government accused the US of using the CIA to aid the opposition guerrillas, the so- called \\"Contras.\\" That would constitute a direct violation of the Boland Amendmentt, which prohibited the American government from intervening in Nicaragua. So, that accusation was largely denied by the CIA, the Pentagon, and the US Government. During the Iran-Contra investigation, it came to light that the CIA was, in fact, illegally selling weapons, airplane parts and missiles to Iran in exchange for off-the-records money and firearms, which were then used to supply the Contras in Nicaragua. This was a double violation of US foreign policy, as the US government was prohibited both from selling weapons to Iran and from interfering in Nicaragua's political situation. The Tower Commission also stated that \\"using the Contras as a front, and against international law, and US law, weapons were sold, using Israel as intermediaries, to Iran, during the brutal Iran–Iraq War. The US was also supplying weapons to Iraq, including ingredients for nerve gas, mustard gas and other chemical weapons.\\" The Iran-Contra affair was one of the biggest arms scandals of the 1980s. It resulted in indictments involving authorities as such as the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger; Oliver North, member of the National Security Council; Alan D. Fiers, Chief of the CIA's Central American Task Force; Clair George, Chief of Covert Ops-CIA; Robert C. McFarlane, National Security Adviser; among others.

Hamrock (1860-1939) was an Irish-born American soldier who served in multiple conflicts as part of the U.S. Army and Colorado National Guard. He led a portion of the militia that participated in the Ludlow Massacre, part of the 1913-1914 Colorado Coalfield War. After the First World War, he would serve as Colorado’s Adjutant General. Early life Born in Caltragh, Sligo, Ireland in 1860 to James and Catherine Hamrock. Patrick moved to the California by 1880 and married Ellen McDonnell in 1884. Beginning of military career Hamrock joined the U.S. Army as a member of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, a unit regularly involved in the battles of the Indian Wars against the Native American inhabitants of the Western United States during the latter-half of the 1800s. He was present during the Ghost Dance War against the Miniconjou and Hunkpapa Lakota, and participated 1890 campaign that included the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota, where 200-300 Lakota were killed.McGovern, George; Guttridge, Leonard. The Great Coalfield War. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972. 213 p. Hamrock was involved in founding the Rocky Mountain Sharpshooters for the Spanish-American War, composed of volunteer marksmen from the Western US, but they never saw combat. He later saw service in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. In the years that followed, Hamrock became the coach of the state rifle team, was promoted to major in the Colorado National Guard, and began operating a saloon in Denver.Papanikolas, Zeese. Buried Unsung: Louis Tikas and the Ludlow Massacre. Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah, 1982. 108 p. He married Annie Watson there on 12 June 1898. Colorado Coalfield War On 23 September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America declared a strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company in southern Colorado in an effort to secure better pay and collective bargaining. Up to 20,000 strikers were evicted from the company towns that dotted the coal-rich Sangre de Christo region, raising tent cities nearby with the help of the UMWA.Martelle, Scott. Blood Passion: The Ludlow Massacre and Class War in the American West. New Brunswick, New Jersey and London: Rutgers University Press, 2007. bib., illus., index, 266 p. One of these towns-turned-tent cities was the Ludlow Colony. What followed was several weeks of violence between strikers, non- striking and strikebreaking miners, hired-gun Baldwin-Felts detectives, and deputized militia. The Colorado National Guard was mobilized on 28 October and arrived in the strike zone by train before the end of the month. The Major Hamrock was in charge of Company B of the National Guard, a 34-man detachment composed largely of enlisted CF&I; mine guards and detectives stationed mostly at Cedar Hill near Tabasco.McGovern & Guttridge, 211. After six months of deployment to the largely isolated strike zone, the majority of the National Guardsmen were allowed to return to their livelihoods. Company K, commanded by the amicable attorney-Captain Phillip Van Cise, withdrew from Ludlow, leaving Hamrock to send a 12 troops to fill their place. Tensions in the region had decreased from a peak in October–November 1913, but rose again in March 1914 following the discover of a non-striking miner's body near the Forbes Colony of strikers. General John Chase, in command of the National Guard, order the strikers' colony razed and the men arrested, an action that indirectly resulted in two infants dying of exposure.Andrews, Thomas G. Killing for Coal: America's Deadliest Labor War. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2008. 270 p. Ludlow Massacre Lt. Karl Linderfelt (center) with two of his brothers (left) and Major Hamrock (right, mustache).Arrested President John McLennan, who led UMWA District 15 at start of 1913-1914 Strike, with Major Patrick Hamrock following the Ludlow Massacre. The troops at Ludlow under Hamrock's direction were stationed on Water Tank Hill, an elevated position that overlooked the colony. Alongside Hamrock's troops were militia under the command of Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, who had previously seen combat against the strikers in the early stage of the conflict and also had authority over Company B.Andrews, 270. These militia and troops were what remained after the bulk of the National Guard withdrew north, though the withdrawn troops were yet to be demobilized. Inside the 1,200-person Ludlow Colony, Cretan-born Greek striker Louis Tikas was helping to sooth tensions between the other Greek miners and a growingly-anxious Guard and militia presence. Following a tense day of Orthodox Easter festivities, on 20 April 1914, Hamrock received word from Linderfelt that an Italian woman was attempting to locate her husband named Tuttolimando, who was believed to live in the Ludlow Colony.Andrews, 271.Martelle, 161. Hamrock dispatched a corporal and two enlisted men to search for him, and it became clear it Tikas had to be involved. During Hamrock's conversation with Tikas, the Greeks in the camp grew restless. Soon, armed miners were spotted by Hamrock's adjutant Lieutenant Ray Benedict, leading Hamrock to send for Linderfelt's men at Cedar Hill. Hamrock sent for reinforcements and a second machine gun to be brought to Ludlow from Cedar Hill, saying \\"put the baby in the buggy and bring it along.\\" Hamrock again spoke to the miners via telephone and agreed to meet Tikas at the Colorado & Southern train station near the colony. At 8:50 AM, Hamrock met Tikas at the agreed location, whereupon Tikas informed the troops and distraught woman that the man in question was not in the Ludlow Colony.McGovern & Guttridge, 214. Greek miners moving in a flanking fashion towards an arroyo were seen by National Guardsmen who were emplacing the second machine gun. Tikas rushed back to the camp, reportedly carrying a white handkerchief in an attempt to prevent a fight.Papanikolas, 218.Martelle, 163. Hamrock also failed to reach his own lines before the gunfire began.McGovern & Guttridge, 215. Who fired the first shot is unclear,Andrews, 272. but immediately the troops detonated three bombs intended to alert the Linderfelt detachment at Berwind and other militiamen at Delagua.Papanikolas, 219.Martelle, 164. Hamrock would testify that he was among the first to man a machine gun, stating he had fired at points near the colony, rather than directly into it. M1895 machine gun on Water Tank Hill, where Hamrock would fire from in the battle. The man with the binoculars is most likely Lt. Benedict. In the all-day battle that followed, more than a dozen women and children were killed, mostly by smoke inhalation. Armed miners were also killed, as was Tikas. Tikas was found unarmed with his skull beaten in, and Linderfelt was seen carrying a broken Springfield rifle over his shoulder away from the scene.Papanikolas, 226. The Ludlow Massacre, as it came to be known, sparked off the 10-Day War, the deadliest portion of the conflict. Major Hamrock ordered the bodies and charred remains of the camp left undisturbed for over half a day following the battle. Mother Jones would list Hamrock as one of the parties who bore the greatest responsibility for the violence at Ludlow. Court-Martial Hamrock was court-martialed for his actions at Ludlow on 13 May 1914. He was charged with murder, larceny, and other crimes associated with the death of Tikas and other unarmed strikers, as well as the twelve children and two women killed during the battle and militia-set fire that followed. Linderfelt faced similar charges. Hamrock pleaded not-guilty to the charges. Pro-strikers decried what they said was \\"white-washing\\" when only militiamen testified on the first day of the court-martial. At Hamrock's court-martial, a Sergeant Davis testified that after Davis and a Corporal Mills arrested Tikas that Tikas ran and was shot under orders to execute any prisoners attempting to escape. Both Hamrock and Linderfelt were never punished, despite a court determining that Linderfelt was guilty of the charges.McGovern & Guttridge, 285-287. Later life and death Hamrock remained in the Colorado National Guard following the December 1914 end of the UMWA strike. On 20 August 1921, Hamrock was promoted to acting brigadier general after serving as a colonel and served as Colorado's Adjutant General. In this capacity, Hamrock ordered Colorado Rangers to expel coal mining \\"agitators\\" during another strike in 1922. Hamrock died on 25 August 1939 in Denver. References Notes :1.

The event aired as a television special episode of MLW's television program Fusion on September 14 on beIN Sports. Fifteen matches were contested at the event with one match airing at the WarGames special, the namesake WarGames match, in which Team Strickland (Barrington Hughes, John Hennigan, Kotto Brazil, Shane Strickland and Tommy Dreamer) defeated The Ravagers (Abyss, Jimmy Havoc, Sami Callihan and The Death Machines (Leon Scott and Sawyer Fulton)). Twelve matches were taped for future episodes of Fusion and two non- televised matches took place. Production Background In July 2017, Major League Wrestling resumed promoting events for the first time since the promotion's original closure in 2004. The success of these events lead MLW to secure a television deal with beIN Sports for a new program, MLW Fusion, which debuted on April 20, 2018. On June 20, MLW.com announced that it would be holding an event titled Fury Road on September 6. However, on July 10, MLW owner Court Bauer tweeted that he would bring back the WarGames match on September 6 at the War Memorial Auditorium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the same venue where MLW had previously held the WarGames match in 2003. Fury Road was postponed to take place on October 4, while WarGames was finalized as the September 6 event. Storylines The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. On the June 22 episode of Fusion, Barrington Hughes ensured that the World Heavyweight Champion Shane Strickland would not get attacked by Sami Callihan and his Death Machines (Leon Scott and Sawyer Fulton). This led to Hughes being attacked by the Death Machines. On the July 13 episode of Fusion, Shane Strickland was mysteriously attacked, which led to him losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Low Ki. The attacker was revealed to be Strickland's former ally Sami Callihan, who said that he perpetrated the attack due to greed of money being paid to him by Ki and Salina de la Renta. Callihan would go on to defeat Strickland on the August 3 episode of Fusion. On August 7, it was announced that Strickland and Callihan would be captains for opposing teams in the WarGames match at WarGames, with Strickland's team consisting of John Hennigan, Tommy Dreamer, Barrington Hughes and Kotto Brazil and Callihan's team called the Ravagers, which would be consisting of Jimmy Havoc and the Death Machines. On August 20, Abyss was revealed as the fifth member of Ravagers. Event The event featured the namesake WarGames match, in which Barrington Hughes, John Hennigan, Kotto Brazil, Shane Strickland and Tommy Dreamer took on The Ravagers (Abyss, Jimmy Havoc, Sami Callihan and The Death Machines (Leon Scott and Sawyer Fulton)). Near the end of the match, Havoc was about to nail an Acid Rainmaker to Dreamer but Dreamer tossed him into Callihan. An enraged Callihan hit a cutter on Havoc. Brazil then wrapped barbed wire on Hughes, who hit a big splash on Fulton and then Brazil and Hughes wrapped the barbed wire around Fulton's head, forcing him to tap out. After the match, the entire losing team attacked Havoc blaming him for the loss. Aftermath Sami Callihan and Jimmy Havoc's brawling led to both men demanding several stipulations for a match against each other, which led MLW management to make a Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal match between the two at Fury Road. Shane Strickland moved on to a feud with Tom Lawlor, which led to the two competing in a match to determine the ace of MLW at Fury Road.

Established in 1977, it is one of the oldest and most important film festivals in Morocco. History Since 1967 a cinema club had existed in Khouribga, with 200 active members and weekly screenings. In 1977, led by Noureddine Saïl, the National Federation of Cinema Clubs in Morocco (FNCCM) helped to organize the Rencontres Cinematographiques de Khouribga. The local cinema club ensured its continued existence. Since Khouribga's main industry is phosphate mining, the club secured funding from the Office of Phosphates. Inspired by internationalist Third Cinema ideals, the cinema club ensured that the festival had a wide African focus. The third African Film Meeting of Khouribga was held from April 2–9, 1988.

The family is highly specific to primates, with minimal similarity or presence in other mammals and no presence in other animals, and its genes' content has been subject to a very high number of duplications in humans. It was described by Vandepoele et al. in 2005 and named as such because NBPF1 was found to be broken by a chromosomal translocation in a neuroblastoma patient. The NBPF genes contain multiple copies of the Olduvai domain. A higher number of copies of this domain has been found to be correlated with brain size and autism severity, while a lower number of copies has been found to be correlated with schizophrenia severity. The only other gene known to have an Olduvai domain is myomegalin, which is believed to be the origin of the NBPF genes as it has orthologues in more basal mammals. Additionally, myomegalin is adjacent to many of the NBPF genes on chromosome 1q21. The first three genes are located at 1p36, while the next four are located at 1p12 and the next eleven at 1q21.

In 1806, her father presented her at a concert in Hamburg, where she first attracted attention. In 1807 she and her father embarked on a concert tour of the country to collect for the needy after the Battle of Copenhagen during the Napoleonic Wars.

She is the honorary president of the (JSA), and is considered to be the last living Spanish socialist militiawoman. Biography Ángeles Flórez Peón was born in Blimea on 17 November 1918. She began working at age 9, scrubbing floors. When she was 15, she lost her older brother Antonio, who was killed along with 23 other men during the suppression of the October 1934 revolutionary strike in . This event led to her joining the Socialist Youth in 1936, and after the July coup d'état, she became a militia member in Colloto. She was also a nurse in a field hospital in Gijón. Her nom de guerre, Maricuela, refers to the main character of a 1934 Jacinto Sánchez play entitled ¡Arriba los pobres del mundo!, which Flórez performed in at age 17, when the Spanish Civil War broke out. Flórez was arrested in October 1937, and initially sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, although this was later reduced to 9 years. In May 1938, she was transferred to Saturrarán prison in Gipuzkoa, where she remained until she was released on parole in August 1941. She lived for a time in Barakaldo, where her sister resided, and later left for Oviedo and L'Entregu, where she worked first in a , and later in a pharmacy. In 1946, Flórez married Graciano Rozada Vallina, who participated in the reorganization of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) of Asturias. Due to his involvement in these processes, Rozada decided to escape to France in August 1947 at the risk of being arrested. Flórez and their daughter met him in March 1948, after being involved in the death of a group of guerrillas. She remained polically active in exile, and participated in the PSOE's 7th Congress in 1958. She returned to Spain in 1960 to visit her family and was arrested at the border, although she was allowed to continue her visit to Asturias and then return to France. In 2003, her husband died in Saint-Éloy-les-Mines, and she returned to Asturias a year later, settling in Gijón, where she joined the in early 2013. In 2014, at age 95, Flórez began using the social network Facebook to share her ideas and political opinions. In addition, to help preserve the history of that era and its generation, in 2013 she published Memorias de Ángeles Flórez Peón 'Maricuela, in which she compiled testimonies from the Revolution of 1934 and the Civil War. In 2018, she presented a book of her memoirs, Las sorpresas de Maricuela, at the Madrid Book Fair.

The Report is based on a several month visit to his home countryside around Changsha, Hunan in early 1927. The Report endorses the violence that had broken out spontaneously in the wake of the Northern Expedition, makes a class analysis of the struggle, and enthusiastically reports the \\"Fourteen Great Achievements\\" of the peasant associations.Suguru, Yokoyama. \\"The Peasant Movement in Hunan.\\" Modern China 1, no. 2 (1975): 204-38. www.jstor.org/stable/189041. At time when the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party was based on urban workers, Mao advocated a revolution based on the peasantry, especially poor peasants. He emphasized that violent and ritualistic struggle was the most effective method of striking against class enemies. Mao's peasant strategy led to disaster in the next few years but the Hunan Report's emphasis on violent struggle against the landlord class gradually become the dominant strategy in the Communist Party's land reform on its road to victory in 1949. The rhetoric of the Hunan Report was taken up by radicals in the Chinese Cultural Revolution and by radical groups around the world, such as the Naxalites in India and the Shining Path in Peru, to follow Mao's example to \\"surround the cities from the countryside\\" by building power in the villages with violence. Background Mao left his home village in Hunan to graduate from Hunan Normal University, then become a teacher and labor organizer after joining the Communist Party. He was impressed by the Guangdong communist leader, Peng Pai. a radical intellectual who organized the peasants of his home districts into Hailufeng Soviet, which redistributed land and promoted social change. When the Communists joined the Nationalists in the First United Front, Peng headed the Peasant Movement Training Institute, of which Mao became co-leader. The Nationalists, with communist support, launched the Northern Expedition in 1925 to unite the country and oust the imperialists, setting off mass demonstrations in the cities and uprisings of peasant associations in the countryside. The leadership of both parties questioned whether the peasant associations should be encouraged in their violence and attacks on landlords. Chen Duxiu, the communist leader, feared that a radical policy would endanger the United Front and disrupt progress by arousing opposition from local powerholders, especially since officers of the revolutionary army tended to come from landholding families. Reports from the countryside were scattered and unreliable. Mao, recognized by both parties as an expert on peasants, was sent to Hunan to investigate local conditions in areas through which Northern Expedition troops had just passed. He published his report in Zhongyang Fukan (Central Committee Periodical) 28 March 1927. Content In this report, Mao Zedong details the actions and achievements of the Chinese peasants in Hunan in an attempt to sway his fellow revolutionaries' opinions on the capabilities of peasantry to communist revolution in China.Wright, Mary C. \\"The Chinese peasant and communism.\\" Pacific Affairs 24, no. 3 (1951): 256–265. This article was written as a reply to the criticisms both inside and outside the Party then being leveled at the Chinese Peasantry.Xuyin, Guo. \\"Reconsideration of Chen Duxiu's Attitude toward the Peasant Movement.\\" Chinese Law & Government 17, no. 1-2 (1984): 51-67. Mao had spent thirty-two days in Hunan Province making an investigation and wrote this report in order to answer to the criticisms of the leadership of the CCP towards the peasantry. Throughout the report, advocated a then heretical strategy of mobilizing poor peasants to carry out \\"struggle\\" (douzheng ). Mao from that point on rejected the idea of peaceful land reform, arguing that peasants could not achieve true liberation unless they participated in the violent overthrow of the landlords. The Report is divided into eight chapters: # The Importance of the Peasant Problem # Get Organized # Down with the Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry! All Power to the Peasant Associations! # \\"It's Terrible!\\" or \\"It's Fine!\\" # The Question of \\"Going too Far\\" # The Movement of the \\"Riffraff\\" # Vanguards of the Revolution The Report concludes by describing \\"Fourteen Great Achievements\\": # Organizing the Peasants into Peasant Associations # Hitting the Landlords Politically # Hitting the Landlords Economically # Overthrowing the Feudal Rule of the Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry--Smashing the Tu and Tuan # Overthrowing the Armed Forces of the Landlords and Establishing Those of the Peasants # Overthrowing the Political Power of the County Magistrate and His Bailiffs # Overthrowing the Clan Authority of the Ancestral Temples and Clan Elders, the Religious Authority of Town and Village Gods, and the Masculine Authority of Husbands # Spreading Political Propaganda # Peasant Bans and Prohibitions # Eliminating Banditry # Abolishing Exorbitant Levies # The Movement for Education # The Co-operative Movement # Building Roads and Repairing Embankments Argument The first section, \\"The Importance of the Peasant Problem\\" reported that he had spent thirty-two days gathering information and found that \\"many of the hows and whys of the peasant movement were the exact opposite of what the gentry in Hankow and Changsha were saying.\\" He saw violent and spontaneous peasant uprising > In a very short time, in China's central, southern and northern provinces, > several hundred million peasants will rise like a mighty storm, like a > hurricane, a force so swift and violent that no power, however great, will > be able to hold it back. They will smash all the trammels that bind them and > rush forward along the road to liberation. They will sweep all the > imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry > into their graves. Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade > will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide. There > are three alternatives. To march at their head and lead them. To trail > behind them, gesticulating and criticizing. Or to stand in their way and > oppose them. Every Chinese is free to choose, but events will force you to > make the choice quickly.(Section: \\"The Importance Of The Peasant Problem\\" The main targets of attack by the peasants were the \\"local tyrants, the evil gentry and the lawless landlords, but in passing they also hit out against patriarchal ideas and institutions, against the corrupt officials in the cities and against bad practices and customs in the rural areas.\\" The poorest peasants were the \\"most revolutionary group\\" and would be the most reliable in the overthrow of the \\"patriarchal-feudal class.\\" In response to those in the party who objected to this violent approach he replied: > Revolution is not a dinner party, nor an essay, nor a painting, nor a piece > of embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so > temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an > insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.... > Without using the greatest force, the peasants cannot possibly overthrow the > deep-rooted authority of the landlords which has lasted for thousands of > years.(Section) \\"The Question Of 'Going Too Far The poor peasants, Mao continued, \\"have always been the main force in the bitter fight in the countryside. They have fought militantly through the two periods of underground work and of open activity. They are the most responsive to Communist Party leadership. They are deadly enemies of the camp of the local tyrants and evil gentry and attack it without the slightest hesitation.\\"(Section) \\"Vanguards Of The Revolution\\" Significance and analysis In the short run the peasant strategy was disastrous, since neither local peasant associations nor the Party could stand up to the guns and organization of the local power holders or Chiang Kai-shek's armies. In a short time the Party was almost wiped out and forced from their urban base. Mao summarized the lesson he learned in another famous slogan, \\"power grows from the barrel of a gun.\\" He and Zhu De then organized the Chinese Red Army and established an independent rural base. He replied to critics in 1930, \\"A single spark can start a prairie fire.\\"A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire January 1930, Selected Works of Mao Zedong Volume I (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1964). But the Hunan Report marked a decisive turning point in the revolutionary strategy that eventually brought the Party to power in 1949. Roy Hofheinz, Jr. writes that Mao's contribution at the time was not policy, since he skirts the issues of land confiscation or ownershop, but criticizing leaders for not taking a revolutionary attitude. His innovation was the insistence that only the poorest were able to turn things upside down. The ruling class must be destroyed, for a \\"revolution is an \\"act of violence whereby one class overthrows another\\". Only the landless peasants and \\"riff- raff\\" could be relied on, because the middle-peasants would pander to the ruling class either knowingly or without realizing it. Mao attacked Nationalist and Communist leaders who looked down on these peasants and deplored violence, for violence was to be celebrated. Maurice Meisner points out that the report contained two \\"heresies\\" from the point of view of orthodox Marxism. First, Mao bypassed the urban proletariat and second, relied on the initiative of the peasantry, not the Communist Party or the Comintern. The word \\"hurricane\\" showed Mao did not see the need for extensive organizing or deep preparation. Nor did the \\"single spark\\" strategy await the painful and slow development of capitalism or the bourgeois stage of history to prepare for the eventual revolution in the future. Meisner notes the irony: had not the White Terror nearly destroyed the fledgling Party and driven it from the cities, Mao's heresies might have cut short his career as a Communist. p. 51 Elizabeth Perry adds that the Report set the standard for understanding public emotions, for Mao's principle of \\"without investigation, no one has the right to speak,\\" and the mass line, which needed organizers to understand the target audience to be mobilized. , p. 39 Another feature that was unusual for the time was the special attention to women. The Report argued that while men were oppressed by political authority, clan authority, and religious authority, women were \\"also dominated by men.\\" Wang Lingzhen, “Women’s Liberation,” in Afterlives of Chinese Communism: Political Concepts from Mao to Xi (United States: Verso Books, 2019), p. 318 Legacy Zhou Libo's 1948 novel The Hurricane and William Hinton's Fanshen: A Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village (1966) put the Hunan Report's analysis into a dramatic and widely read form that convinced many that Mao's revolution had moral legitimacy. During the Cultural Revolution, the Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (Little Red Book) spread slogans taken from the Report widely and Mao's secretary and ideological advisor Chen Boda published a pamphlet analyzing its message and importance. The Report inspired radical groups around the world, such as the Naxalites in India, Sendero Luminosa in Peru, and Black Panthers in the United States. p. 289 Publication and translations * First published in Zhongyang Fukan (Central Committee Periodical) 28 March 1927. * The official text, in Selected Works of Mao Tse- tung.

It was widely popular and frequently reprinted, with Smith adding more poems over time. Elegiac Sonnets is credited with re-popularizing the sonnet form in the eighteenth century. It is notable for its poetic representations of personal emotion, which made it an important early text in the Romantic literary movement.  Contents  The first edition of Elegiac Sonnets in 1784 was a single volume with sixteen sonnets and three other poems. The ninth edition, in 1800, was the last which Smith supervised. The last edition to add new poems, the tenth edition in 1812, was two volumes, with fifty-nine sonnets and eight other poems.  Poems in the first 1784 edition  * Sonnet I [\\"The partial muse\\"] * Sonnet II, \\"Written at the Close of Spring\\" * Sonnet III, \\"To a Nightingale\\" * Sonnet IV, \\"To the Moon\\" * Sonnet V, \\"To the South Downs\\" * Sonnet VI, \\"To Hope\\" * Sonnet VII, \\"On the Departure of the Nightingale\\" * Sonnet VIII, \\"To Sleep\\"After the first edition, this poem is designated as Sonnet X in the second edition, and Sonnet XI in subsequent editions * Chanson, par le Cardinal Bernis * Imitation * The Origin of Flattery * Sonnet, Supposed to be Written by Werther [\\"Go, cruel tyrant\\"] * Sonnet, Supposed to be Written by Werther, \\"To Solitude\\" * Sonnet, Supposed to be Written by Werther [\\"Make there my tomb\\"] * Sonnet, from Petrarch [\\"Loose to the wind\\"] * Sonnet, from Petrarch [\\"Where the green leaves\\"] * Sonnet, from Petrarch [\\"Ye vales and woods\\"] * \\"To Spring\\"After the first edition, this poem is designated as Sonnet VIII * Untitled sonnet [\\"Blest is yon shepherd\\"]After the first edition, this poem is designated as Sonnet IX  Selected poems added in later editions  * Sonnet XXVII [\\"Sighing I see yon little troop\\"] * Sonnet XXXII, \\"To Melancholy.

Instead, she experimented with sonnet forms that were better suited to the English language. Many sonnets are technically Shakespearean sonnets, but most are irregular in some way. Scholars have described her experiments with the sonnet form as pursuing a simpler, more natural, and more direct poetic language which matched the emotions she expressed better than the artificial language common to Italian sonnets. This pursuit of simple, direct expression is among the reasons Smith is classed as a Romantic poet, and anticipates the poetic innovations of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads. The Romantic poet John Keats was indebted to Smith's innovations for his own attempts to devise a new, specifically English sonnet form. There was some backlash against this simplicity. Because Italian sonnets require many more rhymes on the same word ending, the Shakespearean sonnet form was considered to be easier than Petrarchan or Miltonic sonnets, and therefore less legitimate. William Beckford parodied the perceived easiness of Smith's sonnets with a poem called \\"Elegiac Sonnet to a Mopstick.\\" Anna Seward, a major female sonneteer to follow Smith, criticized Smith for deviating from the prescribed forms. Similarly, when Mary Robinson published her own sonnet sequence in 1796, she emphasized her own adherence to formal rules in the title Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets.  Influences  Smith's sonnets were influenced by Thomas Gray's poetry, including his only sonnet, \\"On the Death of Mr. Richard West,\\" which was written in 1742 and published in 1775. Smith frequently praised Gray as a poet and referenced his works, which share her melancholy tone. Smith was also aware of John Milton's seventeenth-century sonnets, such as his \\"O Nightingale,\\" which defined what eighteenth-century poets expected from English sonnets. After the first edition of Elegiac Sonnets, Smith would also be influenced as a poet by William Cowper's The Task.  Major themes  Melancholy sensibility  An overall feeling of bleak sadness is the dominating feature of Elegiac Sonnets, setting Smith's works apart from previous sonnets, which were typically love poems. Sentimental novels at the time popularly featured male figures of lonely, melancholy suffering, such as Harley in The Man of Feeling (1771) and Werther in The Sorrows of Young Werther (published in English in 1779). Elegiac Sonnets created a female, poetic version of this figure in many autobiographical sonnets. Other sonnets describe themselves as having been written by Werther and convey emotional moments of the book.  Nature  Smith's depiction of the natural world is notable for introducing a key Romantic theme in ways that don't match later Romantic depictions. The Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge particularly praised the sonnets that make connections between nature and human feelings, a poetic technique which would come to be a defining trait of Romantic poetry. However, in most of her poetry, Smith's depiction of nature differed from the later Romantics in that she was interested in the scientific details of the natural world. Her depictions of nature are not typically transcendent experiences which are interesting for how they impact the poet's selfhood, but rather descriptions of real-life phenomena which are interesting for the intellectual challenges they pose to understanding.  Literary impact   Sonnet revival  The sonnet as a poetic form was first popular in English language during the Renaissance, but it had fallen out of use by the eighteenth century. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his literary criticism, famously credited Smith and her contemporary William Lisle Bowles (whose Fourteen Sonnets came out five years later, in 1789) with creating a revival of the English sonnet. Bowles achieved similar success to Smith, though contemporary reviews identified his form, tone, and subjects as derivatives of Smith's. The sonnet ultimately became one of the leading poetic forms of Romantic poetry, used at some point by every major Romantic poet except William Blake. Importantly, the eighteenth century revival of the sonnet now included female sonneteers. Paula Feldman and Daniel Robinson described the revival as \\"the first period of literary history in which women poets showed they could match skill with male poets in an arena earlier closed to them, for previously women had existed in the sonnet only as love objects to be wooed or idealized.\\" The sonnet form, as a classic and almost old-fashioned kind of writing, carried a cultural legitimacy which was lacking in newer genres like the novel. Smith was the first eighteenth-century woman to publish a volume of sonnets.  Reception  Smith's sonnets were highly regarded during her lifetime. The journalist John Thelwall called Smith \\"the undisputed English master of the genre.\\" The combination of the book's well-crafted poetry and its vivid emotional impact made Elegiac Sonnets one of the most well-respected and popular books of the century. In addition to inspiring poets to write their own sonnets, Elegiac Sonnets inspired many poets to write poems about Smith herself, celebrating her work and sympathizing with her difficult personal circumstances. She was the subject of extended praise by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott, and Leigh Hunt, among many others. However, after her death, Smith grew less popular as her poems came to be regarded as too sentimental. By the mid nineteenth century, she was no longer considered a major poet in her own right, but simply a \\"woman writer\\" and therefore \\"minor\\". By the end of the nineteenth century, Smith was largely forgotten. With the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s, scholars rediscovered Smith's works, especially Elegiac Sonnets. These poems are now featured in all major anthologies of Romantic literature.

It contains material from two albums that Hartman recorded in Tokyo in 1972, Hartman Meets Hino and Hartman Sings Trane's Favorites. The original LPs were only available in Japan. For Trane marks the first time the songs have been released in the United States. Background In 1995, the commercial success of the soundtrack to The Bridges of Madison County, which featured four songs by Johnny Hartman, led to a resurgence of interest in the vocalist's work. Eleven reissues and compilations were released by various record companies between 1995 and 1998, including For Trane, from Blue Note, which contained material from two albums that Hartman had recorded for Capitol Music (Japan) in 1972 but had never been available stateside. Hartman had toured Japan with Art Blakey in 1963, and his participation in the John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album \\"had given Hartman considerable credibility with the Japanese, so an invitation was extended and accepted.\\" In late November 1972, he gave concerts with Japan's most popular jazz group, the Sharps and Flats big band, and with the Terumasa Hino quartet. He also participated in three recording sessions with Japanese musicians. Hartman's biographer, Gregg Akkerman, has written, \\"What a pity that Hartman fans had to wait over twenty years before these well-chosen, well performed, and well-recorded songs found any exposure in America. Only with Hartman's posthumous popularity did Blue Note release an assortment of the Japanese recordings. . . . Had these persuasive recordings been available in the United States during the 1970s, they might very well have reignited Hartman's reputation as a jazz vocalist.\\" Recording On November 25, 1972, Hartman recorded five tunes with a Japanese trio, including three that would eventually appear on For Trane. According to Akkerman, Hartman had to rehearse each song several times with the group. \\"The quality of music captured that day was impressive, but the time expended rehearsing explains why they only completed five songs instead of enough tracks for a complete album.\\" That evening, Hartman performed live with the Hino quartet, which served as a rehearsal for a studio session with the group four days later. On November 29, they recorded all eight songs for a Capitol (Japan) album entitled Hartman Meets Hino that was released in December 1972. Six of these tunes are included on the For Trane compilation. Finally, two days later, Hartman recorded a pair of songs with the Hino rhythm section that would be used to fill out a second Capitol (Japan) album entitled Hartman Sings Trane's Favorites, released in early 1973. Both of the tracks recorded that day are available on For Trane. Reception For Trane has received a mostly positive reception. Scott Yanow at AllMusic wrote, \\"The music alternates between ballads ('Violets for Your Furs' and 'The Nearness of You' are high points) and swingers and, although Hartman does not really improvise, his voice (still in its prime at the time) is appealing.\\" Musician magazine's critic Andrew Gilbert said, \\"With his deep, rich baritone and relaxed delivery, Johnny Hartman was one of jazz's great ballad singers.\\" Gilbert lamented the lack of reissues after Hartman's death in 1983 and called For Trane an \\"especially welcome\\" release. \\"With his voice in fine form ... Hartman endows standards such as 'Nature Boy,' 'The Nearness of You' and 'Sposin' with almost tangible longing and smoldering sensuality.\\" The Skanner's Dick Bogle chose For Trane as one of \\"Dick's Picks,\\" saying it \\"combines beautiful ballads with some uptempo selections for 11 tracks of pure Hartman. The two banner tracks are 'The Nearness of You' and 'My Funny Valentine.'\\" Bogle added, \\"Hartman isn't the only star. Trumpeter Terumaso Hino and pianist Masahiko Kikuchi fit right in the groove.\\" The Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote, \\"There isn't a richer baritone singer, or one who can turn a phrase with the husky sibilance of a reed any better than the late Johnny Hartman. . . . Backed by fine instrumentalists from the Toshiba-EMI label, Hartman extends the sentiment of past great recordings with exquisite covers.\\" The Omaha World-Herald called the work on the album \\"uneven,\\" but with Hartman's \\"charming, resonant voice mostly in control.\\" Reviewing a 2005 reissue of the material, Ong Sor Fern at The Straits Times (Singapore) awarded the album 4.5 our of five stars, claiming that \\"Johnny Hartman was, arguably, the best male jazz vocalist ever. . . . The small combo setting sets off his satiny baritone to perfection. The standouts: A lazy version of Summertime where his deliberate phrasing and great breath control take centrestage; A conversational take on Why Did I Choose You?; and an unusually perky version of the unjustly neglected ballad 'S'posin'.\\" Reissues All of the tracks on For Trane, along with the rest of the songs that Hartman recorded for Hartman Meets Hino and Hartman Sings Trane's Favorites, are included on the 2005 compact disc The Tokyo Albums, released by Gambit Records.

Villa Ammende in Pärnu (Estonia), currently a luxury hotel.  Biography  Ewald Ammende came from a wealthy, influential and long-established merchant family in Livonia. After attending high school in Pernau, from 1910 he studied commerce at the Polytechnic in Riga, economics in Cologne and in Tübingen, and received his doctorate in political science at the Christian-Albrecht University in Kiel. During the First World War, he worked in the catering business for cities in southern Russia. Following the division of the historical region of Livonia into Estonia and Latvia, Ammende began to campaign for national minorities in the international politics. From 1919 to 1922 he worked as an editor and publishing director at the \\"Rigasche Rundschau\\" (Riga Review), where he cooperated with another famous defender of ethnic minorities Paul Schiemann. As co-founder of the Association of German Minorities in Europe, Ammende played a key role in the creation of the \\"Law on the Cultural Autonomy of Minorities in Estonia\\" in 1925. In the same year minority representatives from different countries elected him General Secretary of the Congress of European Nationalities (ENK). He became a strong advocate of ethnic minority right and established an umbrella organization to represent ethnic minority organizations (not only those of ethnic Germans). Ammende assumed that a solution of the national questions would not be feasible by way of irredentism and therefore sought a balance between interests of ethnic groups and nation states on the basis of mutual recognition. In his function as secretary- general of the ENK, he was instrumental in assisting the Jewish associations in submission of the Bernheim petition, which discredited him to the National Socialists. At the same time he came into conflict with the US and the Soviet government because of various aid actions and campaigns of the ENK. Ewald Ammende was also honorary director of the \\"Interconfessional and transnational relief organization of his Eminence Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna\\".Verena Moritz u. a.: Gegenwelten. Aspekte der österreichisch-sowjetischen Beziehungen 1918–1938. Residenz Verlag, 2014, S. 353. He was in close contact with Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, who helped him in publishing his most famous book Muss Russland hungern? Menschen und Völkerschicksale in der Sowjetunion (\\"Must Russia starve? Destinies of People and Peoples in the USSR\\"). The word \\"Russia\\" in the book title, as was common in those years, referred to USSR in general, although the book covered mostly events in Ukraine and Kuban (West Caucasus). The book stirred much controversy because of its contemporary description of the Soviet famine (currently known as Holodomor). Ammende also discussed in his book systematic oppression of various minorities in Ukraine, including the Poles, Magyars, Romanians, Jews, Belorussians and Crimean Germans. Although Ewald Ammende's rejection of the National Socialists was already known at the time of publication, the Soviet authorities accused the ENK that the book was promoting the National Socialist propaganda. This misleading representation took over in the post-war period, among other East German historians, all the way to the modern research literature. Some historians go so far as to label the entire international campaign of the ENK on the famine awareness as part of the anti-Comintern policy of the Nazi regime. Ammende used in his book uncredited photos made by Alexander Wienerberger during his work in Kharkiv in 1933; these photos are currently well known and were reprinted on many occasions.Josef Vogl: Alexander Wienerberger – Fotograf des Holodomor. Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes (Hrsg.), Jahrbuch 2010, Feindbilder-Verlag, 2015, S. 264 f. Ewald Ammende died on April 15, 1936 under obscure circumstances in Beijing, where he wanted to meet with representatives of Jewish minorities from Valdgeym (Jewish National District in Far East). It is only clear that he died in the German Hospital in Beijing. Obituaries appeared in many European newspapers, in which the details of the cause of death ranged from murder, suicide, heart attack, stroke up to the sugar shock (which is currently considered a possible reason, due to family history of the same disease). After his death, his brother, and his right-hand man, Erich Ammende, took over the management of the ENK as an interim charge. He survived his brother by only seven months and died in Vienna.Sabine Bamberger-Stemmann: Der Europäische Nationalitätenkongress 1925 bis 1938. Herder-Institut, 2000, S. 347.David J.

It is a bypass that travels from the southwestern corner of the city in Totsuka-ku northeast to Kanagawa-ku. It largely serves as a bypass to the west of central Yokohama. Route description The Yokohama Shindō is a bypass that travels from the southwestern corner of the Yokohama in Totsuka-ku northeast through Hodogaya-ku to Kanagawa-ku. It largely serves as a bypass to the west of central Yokohama. The bypass begins at an intersection in Kanagawa-ku with the main line of National Route 1. From this eastern terminus, it travels southwest, then west through the ward. It crosses in to Hodogaya-ku then turns to the southwest again. Just after entering the ward it has a junction with the Mitsuzawa Route and the Daisan Keihin Road. This junction is the beginning of the expressway section of the Yokohama Shindō. The expressway has another major junction with the Yokohama Yokosuka Road in Hodogaya-ku before crossing into Totsuka-ku. In Totsuka-ku, the expressway has a few more interchanges before transitioning back in to a highway with signaled intersections. After this transition, the road eventually ends at an intersection with the main line of National Route 1. History The route that would eventually become the free section of the Yokohama Shindō was established in 1948 during the Occupation of Japan as a bypass of the older Tōkaidō. After the occupation's end in 1952, management of the road was handed over to the Japan Highway Public Corporation and the road was designated as a bypass of National Route 1 on 4 December 1952.. The tolled expressway section was established in 1957. Construction of the expressway took two years, with construction being completed and the expressway opening on 28 October 1959.

It was located at Hemmant (in present-day Murarrie) in Brisbane on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River. It operated from 1889 to 1901. The Aquarium was officially opened with great celebration on 7 August 1889. In addition to the aquarium with its marine life ranging from seals to sharks, there were the \\"finest collection of tigers in captivity\\", a black Java panther, a cheetah, bears, monkeys, a collection of birds (parrots, cockatoos, pigeons, doves, English finches and black swans) and reptiles. Viewing the animals was only part of the entertainment at Queensland's first theme park. The huge concert hall was equipped with an organ which entered guests at concerts on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. There was also an Aquarium Band to serenade the \\"best singers\\" who could be found in Brisbane. The Aquarium boosted the popularity of the area; land near the Aquarium was subdivided and sold as The Queensport Aquarium Estate. The crowds who visited the Aquarium arrived by steamer from the Aquarium Company's own wharf in the Brisbane city centre. This was a package deal. The return fare on the steamers Natone, the Woolwich or the Alice cost two shillings for adults and one shilling for a child. Moonlit excursions to dances in the concert hall were well patronised. The Aquarium and its hall were equipped with every modern convenience including electric light which was connected in September 1889. Daytime activities included sports days to celebrate the new year, picnics on Foundation Day (as Australia Day was then known) and, in May 1891, the amazing sight of a hot air balloon delighted the crowd. The Brisbane Courier reported, \\"Professor Fernandez, an aeronaut who has performed many remarkable feats in the Southern colonies, appeared at the Queensport Aquarium and made his first balloon ascent in this colony\\", a feat which nearly ended in disaster when the balloon began to deflate and appeared likely to sink into the river. Fortunately, the balloon rose again and landed safely. The Aquarium was not greatly troubled by the large flood in 1890, even though the wharf in the city was inundated. However, in the flood on 5 and 6 February 1893 tore down the fences, liberating many of the animals, and ruined the carefully landscaped gardens. The animals were rescued, but the building was subsequently used as a dance hall. Before long, J D Campbell and the Aquarium Company advertised the sale of the steamers and, although picnic parties from the city continued to travel to dances and picnics, the Aquarium's popularity had diminished by the end of the 19th century.

Plot  Division of Chisholm The alleged plot was made public during the November 24 airing of 60 Minutes on Australia's Nine Network, citing sources with knowledge of the plot. It was suggested that Chinese spies offered $1 million to fund a man's campaign for the Division of Chisholm. The Division of Chisholm is noted to contain many voters of Chinese heritage. In 2018, the incident was reported by the man who was approached with the offer to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).  Parties reportedly involved   Bo \\"Nick\\" Zhao  The target of the plot was reported to be Bo \\"Nick\\" Zhao, who once owned a number of car dealerships and lived in Glen Iris with a wife and daughter. Zhao's former business associates have described him as an ambitious man who got ahead of himself and wanted to make money quick. According to court records, Zhao was charged with obtaining financial advantage by deception in 2017, due to accusations he obtained loans via fraudulent means in order to buy luxury vehicles. Administrators began to pursue Zhao in 2019 over the collapse of a car dealership in Brighton. By early 2019, Zhao had a fallout with his wife over debts Zhao owed to Chinese investors that were described as \\"shadowy\\". Reports say Zhao owed millions to people who, over time, became increasingly angry. In March 2019, Zhao was found dead in a hotel room in the Mount Waverley area of Melbourne. Authorities have not been able to establish the cause of Zhao's death, nor have they been able to establish why Zhao died. The death has prompted a coroner's inquiry into the incident. Involvement with the Liberal Party Records kept by the Liberal party show Zhao as a party member in the Division of Chisholm from 2015 until his death. Andrew Hastie, a Liberal MP who chairs the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security , describe Zhao as a paid-up member of the Liberal Party. Sources familiar with Zhao's activities, however, describe him as a low-profile member of the local Liberal Party branch. They say Zhao attended at least one branch gathering with members of his immediate family before the 2016 Federal election, but did not otherwise agitate to become an MP himself. They say Zhao stopped attending party events in 2016 amidst personal problems. A senior Liberal Party member with knowledge of membership lists also said Zhao was not known to senior party members, by any measure.  Brian Chen Chunsheng  Some media reports have identified the person who approached Zhao as Melbourne businessperson Brian Chen Chunsheng. The Age has reported that Chen is flagged as a suspected senior Chinese intelligence operative by various Western security sources, and that Chen has posed for pictures in People's Liberation Army military uniforms, in addition to posing as a journalist during certain international political summits. Chen is known to have made political donations to Australia's two major political parties, and his company is known to be promoting China's Belt and Road Initiative, leading to accusations he is using the Belt and Road Initiative as a cover to conduct intelligence operations. Chen himself has denied the allegations, claiming photos of him donning Chinese military uniforms were merely him borrowing a friend's military uniform to show off, and that he was given journalist accreditation by a media outlet owner in order for him to attend international political summits. Reports have stated that there is no suggestion of Chen having any knowledge or involvement in Zhao's death. Chen has also denied having ever met Zhao.  Aftermath  In the 2019 Federal election, Gladys Liu was elected as a Liberal Party MP for the Division of Chisholm, beating out a Labor Party candidate of Taiwanese heritage in a surprise victory. Even prior to details of the infiltration plot being made public, Liu was accused of being a member of the China Overseas Exchange Association, which belonged to the State Council of the People's Republic of China at the time of her membership. In addition, Liu has been accused of being an honorary chair of overseas Chinese trade and commerce bodies that are believed to be linked to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department. Reports on this incident has brought renewed attention to allegations against Liu, especially since at least two photos show Liu and Zhao at a meeting that was held in Liu's former home during Australia Day in 2016. Liu said she has \\"no recollection\\" of having met Zhao.  Reactions   Australia  ASIO's Director-General, Mike Burgess, refused to comment on the matter in depth due to \\"long-standing practice\\", but did say the agency was previously aware of the incident, and there is an active investigation underway. Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the allegations as \\"deeply disturbing and troubling\\".  People's Republic of China  Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang have decried the accusations as \\"nothing but lies\\", and accused Australia of \\"a state of hysteria and extreme nervousness\\".  Impact  It was noted that Zhao's legal and financial troubles would have made it almost impossible for him to be selected by the Liberals as a candidate, let alone win the election. Monash University lecturer Sow Keat Tok said while the repercussions would have been huge if the allegations are true and Zhao was elected, it would still have taken Zhao years, if not decades, to get into the inner circle of the Australian decision-makers.

Map of Mali and its neighbors. Mali joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on September 27, 1963. Since joining, Mali has been an active member of the Fund, having made 18 arrangements to borrow money since its membership began, primarily aimed at addressing stability and security issues in the country. Though Mali has had a steadily positive GDP growth rate since 2011 and a large amount of natural gold reserves, its economic and social fragility have caused developmental challenges as ethnic violence and terrorism weaken the government. The IMF projects that Mali will continue to have a GDP growth rate of around 5%, and a contained level of inflation, but warns that the situation could rapidly deteriorate without the implementation of programs for stability and resilience. The present IMF outlook for Mali's economic prospects tends negative due to their issues with internal poverty and strife. Mali is currently ranked as one of the world's poorest countries by the United Nations Development Programme, and their agriculture-heavy economy leaves them vulnerable to weather issues. Demographic issues have led to a uniquely unstable situation that has been exploited by militant groups, threatening the centralization and stability of the government. Corruption has also been an area of concern for the IMF.  Malian Economy and History   Pre-Colonial Era  The Mali Empire was one of the richest in the world at the time, and its mineral wealth was renowned across the world. The rich gold deposits and trading centers, such Djenné and Timbuktu, gave it a strong position in western Africa. Though the empire was replaced by other nations such as the Songhai Empire and the Fulani Empire, the natural wealth of the region made it a trade center through to the 19th century. Ultimately, the Malian nations collapsed under internal religious pressures and external political influence from the French empire and they were integrated into French Sudan. During the colonial period, Mali served as a source of labor for the French West African colonies.  Post-Colonial Era  Mali gained its independence in 1960, and moved to implement socialist policies designed in the style of the Soviet system at the time. This would not last long, however, and in 1968, a coup ensued and the new government moved to implement economic reforms. The Sahel drought and internal political struggles crippled the reforms however, and they were not able to achieve much success. The new government took control as a one-party state, and agreed to some structural adjustment economic reforms with the IMF. The austerity imposed by these reforms led to unrest, however, and by the 1990s the nation had transitioned to a new democratic state.  IMF Contributions and Loans  Mali has been a heavy borrower from the IMF, currently owing about 238 million SDRs, the equivalent of around $327 million. The majority of these loans are aimed at addressing instability and lack of economic diversity in the country. The IMF claims that these projects have seen success in spite of the difficult conditions, helping quell instability and address trade concerns. The short- term macroeconomic outlook seems positive, though program implementations have been slowed down by structural issues. Mali has been praised for its efforts in meeting both IMF goals and those set by the West African Economic and Monetary Union, of which it is a founding member. Current projects are focused on improving Mali's revenue collection, which currently represents a small portion of their overall GDP. To address this issue, the IMF recently approved a new loan to work on improving administrative inefficiencies and combat rising fuel prices. Other areas of focus include the struggling state energy company which is currently going through financial difficulties, and vulnerability to shocks from fluctuating prices of gold, cotton, and fuel.  2012 Crisis and Instability   Background  French soldier in Gao in 2013. IMF research claims that much of Mali's instability and structural issues stem from the 2012 Malian coup d'état in northern Mali. The jihadist- backed Tuareg rebellion allowed insurgents to seize control of the northern region, defeating Mali's security forces.Arieff, Alexis, Crisis in Mali, Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, January 14, 2013 The defeated military seized control of the weakened government leading to international condemnation. During this period of governmental transition, the separatists and jihadists were able to strengthen their control of the northern regions, further weakening the new administration. International condemnation further weakened the economy as their neighbors enforced fuel sanctions. The nation is now dependent on fuel trucks from Senegal and the Ivory Coast. Eventually, infighting amongst the separatists and rebels allowed international forces to restore order to the region and take back control from the jihadists. The situation has worsened in recent years, with more than 300 deaths in 2018. With this structural instability and governmental weakness, distribution of resources and services in the recently occupied north has been difficult. The north continues to face unrest and instability, but projects like the United Nations' MINUSMA have aimed to restore governmental control over the region and defeat the remaining rebels and insurgents.  Economic Impacts and IMF Recovery Program  The direct impacts of the crisis include reduced economic output in services and banking, and displaced nearly 400,000 Malians. The recurrent attacks and insurgencies has hindered IMF staff's ability to implement their programs to address government reform and economic policy. In the immediate aftermath, economic growth went from an expected 5% to minus 0.8%. Security spending had to be adjusted to face the immediate threat to the nation, and as such public spending had to be dropped down. The IMF's projects to address this involve stabilization of tax revenue collection, promoting trade, and encouraging structural stability in wake of the coup. To be able to implement effective measures, they recommend increasing taxes to improve their tax-to-GDP ratio relative to their West African neighbors. In association with France and the UN, some agreements have been made between the government and the Tuareg separatists, allowing for elections to take place. However, jihadists attacks have worsened in some regions with other rebel groups seeking to take advantage of the situation.  Economic Diversification and Vulnerability   Economic Revenues  Mali is heavily reliant on its gold mining and agriculture as part of its exports and GDP. Agriculture represents 30% of their GDP, and gold and cotton combined represent 80% of their exports. Gold alone has represented over half of exports for nearly two decades. The reliance on mining leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by multi-national enterprises shifting their profits to other countries, causing Mali to lose out on tax streams. The IMF has recommended programs to close down loopholes in their tax system to force multinational enterprises to contribute further to Mali's tax base. Current corporate guidelines in Mali allow for very loose tax management. Although the authorities have taken steps to follow IMF suggestions and increase tax revenue, overly optimistic budget projections have clouded attempts to fix the issue.  Vulnerability  The country's demographics further endanger their economic and political stability. 50% of the population is under 15, and their population is expected to increase from 18 million to 45 million by 2050. Price fluctuations combined with the rapid population growth have led to issues in the provision of basic resources and commodities. Food and water instability have been constant issues, with the problem worsening since 2012 as international organizations and NGOs refuse to be involved in a region with a high potential for hostage-taking.

The state visit of Deng Xiaoping to the United States () was the first official visit by a paramount leader of China to the US. Deng undertook the visit in his official capacities as the First Vice Premier of the State Council and the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The visit initiated a series of high-level exchanges that would continue until the spring of 1989. It also marked the highest-ranking Chinese visit to the country since Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China in 1943. Announced on 15 December 1978, the visit began in late January 1979 and went on into February. Meetings and ceremonies Visit to Washington D.C.

The evening of 29 January, a state dinner was held in honor of Deng and his delegation at the White House. It marked the first return of former President Richard Nixon to the White House since his resignation speech in August 1974. Originally, President Carter refused to invite Nixon, however Deng had stated that he would visit him at his California residence if he was not invited. During the dinner, Nixon had a private meeting with both Deng and Carter. A string section from the United States Air Force Band began to perform as dessert was being served. Following the dinner, Deng and Carter went to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to witness performances by groups such as the Joffrey Ballet as well as singers such as John Denver and Shirley MacLaine. Joint Communique Jimmy Carter and Deng at the Signing Ceremony. The Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations was signed during the visit. It followed the announcement of the ending of official U.S. recognition of the Republic of China (commonly known as \\"Taiwan\\"), in December 1978 as well as the full withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel from Taiwan and the end to the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. Visit to Georgia (1-2 February) On 1 February, he arrived in Atlanta, the capital of the state of Georgia, Carter's home state. In Atlanta he visited the headquarters of Coca Cola and later toured the Atlanta Assembly owned by the Ford Motor Company in Hapeville. A banquet was held in honor of Deng the evening of 2 February. The Atlanta Chapter of the National Association of Chinese-Americans was inaugurated the following year as a result of his visit.

Kraft (extreme right) On the morning of 2 February, he arrived at Houston Intercontinental Airport where he was greeted by Mayor of Houston Jim McConn. He arrived on Air Force One with local congressman Mickey Leland. At the arrival ceremony, McConn presented Deng with a box of silver spurs. During this visit he visited the Johnson Space Center and Hughes Tool Company. During the former visit, he climbed on top of a lunar rover used by the Apollo 11 mission. That evening, he was presented a stetson cowboy hat during a rodeo he attended in Simonton hosted by what is now the Greater Houston Partnership.

He also visited former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He visited a factory which assembles Boeing 747s. Reactions and aftermath Most of the American public's reaction toward the visit was negative, with Maoists and nationalists often staging protests. Four days prior to his visit, a group of anti-Deng protesters broke the entrance glass to what is now the Embassy of China in Washington, D.C. During the welcoming ceremony at the White House, two protesters were taken away from the press area after chanting anti-China slogans. In Houston, there was an assassination attempt by a Ku Klux Klan member against Deng. The KKK member, who rushed to the podium where Deng was speaking with a knife, was intercepted by an agent of the United States Secret Service.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2015-05/14/content_20711459_2.htmhttps://www.ft.com/content/1a4b4642-fc4d-11e4-b007-00144feabdc0 On 1 March 1979, formal embassies were established in the capitals of the two countries. Vice President Walter Mondale reciprocated Deng's visit with a trip to China in August 1979. Two weeks later, the SS Letitia Lykes entered Shanghai harbor in the first US-flagged ship to visit the PRC in 30 years.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201901/04/WS5c2eb0afa31068606745ed60.html This visit led to agreements in September 1980 on maritime affairs, civil aviation links, and textile matters, as well as a bilateral consular convention.

The line operates every 12-30 minutes at all times. Route K6 trips are roughly 40 minutes. Background Route K6 operates daily between Fort Totten station and White Oak Shopping Center via New Hampshire Avenue providing service to residents between the two points. Route K6 currently operates out of Bladensburg division. The line originally operated out of Montgomery division until 2019. History K6 originally began operating as part of the Capital Transit Company \\"New Hampshire Avenue\\" Bus Line in 1964, between White Oak Shopping Center in White Oak, MD & Metro Center in Downtown Washington D.C. mostly operating along Columbia Pike, New Hampshire Avenue, the White Oak FDA/FRC Building, and North Capitol Street NW. K6 eventually became a WMATA Metrobus route on February 4, 1973 when WMATA bought all four failing private bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them all together to form its own, Metrobus System. 1978 Changes On February 19, 1978 after Fort Totten station opened, K6 was truncated to only operate between the White Oak Shopping Center & Fort Totten station. The remaining segment of K6's original routing between Fort Totten and Metro Center was replaced by WMATA's brand new route K4, which was designed to operate between Fort Totten and Metro Center. 2013 Changes On December 29, 2013, route K6 discontinued all service to the Food and Drug Administration and instead remained straight along New Hampshire Avenue.

At the time of his birth, Württemberg was an independent kingdom located in a region of Germany known as Swabia. Swabia has a unique culture and Alemannic dialect. His business is credited with helping to expand the machine embroidery industry in Hudson county, NJ. during the first half of the twentieth century. By the 1950s, the area known as North Hudson which includes the modern day municipalities of Weehawken, Union City, West New York and Guttenberg had developed into one of the largest centers for machine embroidery in the world. Reiner first traveled to the United States about 1902. He first installed and then began importing embroidery and other textile machines from Europe. He established what became Robert Reiner Incorporated in Weehawken, NJ. Eventually he employed about 200 people.He was the sole importer of VOMAG (Vogtländische Maschinenfabrik AG) embroidery machines from Plauen, Germany. Eventually he produced the first American made schiffli embroidery machine. Reiner held an honorary doctorate of political economy and science from the University of Heidelberg. He remained a benefactor of his native Nürtingen. He was a member of the US Chamber of Commerce, the NY Board of Trade, and was president of the American-German Chamber of Commerce until WWII. In October 1928 he was one of twenty passengers aboard the Graf Zeppelin during its first trans Atlantic commercial passenger flight, flying from Friedrichshafen, Germany to Lakehurst, NJ.  Training  Reiner began training to be a machinist at age 15 (about 1895) at Heller Brothers in Nürtingen, Germany. He then went to work with Adolf Saurer in Arbon, Switzerland. Saurer was producing both hand machines and schiffli machines at this time. About 1900 he went to work for VOMAG in Plauen, Germany as an erector's assistant. He was 20 years old. In 1902 he traveled to Weehawken, NJ to set up VOMAG machines at E.A. Bodenmann, then returned to Switzerland and Austria until 1903. In 1904 he returned to the US and started a machine repair shop at 449 West Street, West Hoboken. In 1908 he founded and was president of Robert Reiner Importing Company. In 1909 he built the 25,000 square foot, concrete building, at 550 Gregory Ave, Weehawken which still exists today. Business expanded after WW1 and eventually became Robert Reiner Inc. The broader context of Reiner’s career was the machine age, which is also known as: the second industrial revolution. More specifically he worked in the machine embroidery industry. Embroidery was used in the garment industry, to embellish linens, handkerchiefs, table cloths, curtains, etc. The textile industry was an important, but labor-intensive industry before the industrial revolution. Mechanization affected multiple aspects of the textile and garment industries.  The American machine embroidery industry  The canton of St. Gallen, in eastern Switzerland, was once considered to be the embroidery center of the world. Many embroidery and embroidery machine innovations took place in Switzerland and in Saxony Germany, near Plauen. Plauen was an important center for machine lace. Saurer in Arbon, and VOMAG in Plauen became two of the largest developers and manufacturers of early embroidery machines. Each had a foundry and machine shops necessary to produce the hundreds of components used in the machines. The first half of the twentieth century saw great advancements in machine technology including mass production, interchangeable parts, and electrification. Embroidery machines evolved quickly - from manual hand machines to the fully automated schiffli machines. Embroidery machines enabled the mass production of embroidery and lace, once considered a luxury item. U.S. demand for embroidery increased after the Civil War ended in 1865. Switzerland met much of this demand. The first and second world wars had a profound effect on the European embroidery industry and economy. The European embroidery industry collapsed during WW1. VOMAG and the city of Plauen were destroyed by bombing during WW2. Meanwhile, a third center for machine embroidery, located in Hudson county, NJ, emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century. Located on the west bank of the Hudson River, opposite New York City. Hudson county was close to the American market, e.g. New York City’s garment district, textile manufacturing, and was a hub for both domestic and international transportation.  Reiner's Business  Robert Reiner Importing Company Weehawken, NJ - looking towards New York City.A photo taken in NJ circa 1903 shows an advertisement for the Robert Reiner Importing Company on the side of a horse drawn wagon. This would have been typical of the technology at that time. But, this would quickly change. Many Swiss and Germans immigrated to Hudson county at the beginning of the century, and helped to build the industry there. They brought knowledge of the machines, and the methods that were necessary to produce embroidery and lace. Ancillary businesses that supplied fabrics, thread, embroidery designs, “punching” or translating of designs to Jacquard punch tapes, dying, chemical lace etching, and bleaching of so called \\"white goods\\" also developed in NJ. This network of interdependent businesses mirrored the industries in Switzerland and Germany. Reiner's connection to VOMAG enabled him to become the sole importer of their machines The machines were manufactured in Germany at the VOMAG factory and then assembled in NJ. Reiner imported semi automated schiffli machines which used a pantograph as well as fully automated schiffli machines which were programmed using a Jacquard punch card reader. He also imported punching machines which were used to encode the design onto the schiffli punch cards. The 1917 advertisement at right shows 10 and 15 meter schiffli embroidery machines. Fifteen meter machines were state of the art at that time. Advertisement 1917 - ten and fifteen meter schiffli embroidery machines A Robert Reiner Importing Company catalog published about 1914 opens with an illustration of the VOMAG factory in Plauen. The captions reads: \\"3,800 experienced engineers and skilled workmen are continuously employed in this large establishment.\\" The pages show awards won by VOMAG at various European expositions, and side by side portraits of Robert Reinier and the late Robert Zahn. Zahn adapted the Jacquard card reader to the embroidery machine. VOMAG's card reader was known as the automat, or the Zahn system. This was cast on the machine's frame. The catalog advertises: ten and 15-meter embroidery machines, demonstrations using the customer's own design, training, and also parts and technical support for other brands. The catalog provides a directory of every owner in the US, and provides the following statistics: \\"total number of machines delivered by us in this country, 1,207.\\" Also, \\"we have sold and delivered 36 pantograph machines and 72 Zahn automats (these will appear in our next year's [1915] statistics). Shuttle embroidery machines running in Switzerland, 8,090.\\" Contemporary publications provide a similar description of the business and demonstration plant The industry in NJ experienced multiple highs and lows as demand followed fashion. The Great Depression adversely affected all businesses. The war years benefitted the schiffli emblem manufacturers. Reiner's competition included Saentis (orthographic variant of: Säntis) in Union City. The latter was acquired by Saurer. Reiner and or his employees made improvements to the schiffli machine and filed multiple U.S. patents. Neither Saurer nor VOMAG exported machines during WW2. VOMAG didn't rebuild after the war. In the 1950s - Reiner produced the first American built schiffli machines based on the Plauen machines. However, the cost of manufacturing them in the US was high. Reiner licensed Zangs Company in Germany to build them.

Mazars USA, LLP, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the United States House of Representatives subpoenas to obtain the tax returns of President Donald Trump, which Trump has litigated to prevent but which had been cleared by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a 7–2 decision issued in July 2020, the Supreme Court vacated the Circuit Court's decision, asserting that the court had not properly assessed the separation of powers between Congress and the President, and remanded the case for review with a set of considerations to evaluate the worthiness of the subpoena request. Background In April 2019, three committees of the U. S. House of Representatives issued four subpoenas seeking the financial records of President Trump, his children, and affiliated businesses. The House Committee on Financial Services's subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One sought records related to foreign transactions, business statements, debt schedules, statements of net worth, tax returns, and suspicious activity identified by that Bank. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's subpoena to Deutsche Bank was for the same information. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a subpoena to Trump's personal accounting firm, Mazars USA, LLP, demanding financial information pertaining to Trump and several affiliated businesses. Although each of the committees sought overlapping sets of financial documents, each supplied different justifications for the requests, explaining that the information would help guide legislative reform in areas ranging from moneylaundering and terrorism to foreign involvement in U. S. elections. The President sued, and the subpoena was blocked while the case wound its way through the courts, losing in district court and on appeal. On November 18, 2019, the Supreme Court agreed to continue the block for a few days, ordering the House Counsel to submit a rebuttal by November 21, which it did. In seeking a rapid subpoena ruling, House general counsel Douglas Letter wrote, \\"The president certainly has no right to dictate the timetable by which third parties provide information that could potentially be relevant to that inquiry.\\" Mazars, the target of the subpoena, stated that it was willing to comply with the subpoena. Trump's lawsuit against Mazars, brought in his personal capacity, delayed Mazars' response. Legal scholar Marty Lederman has described the Mazars case as more important than the Trump v. Vance case. Lederman describes Trump's argument--that Congress entirely lacks \\"constitutional authority to investigate a sitting President's possible conflicts of interest and violations of law\\"--as an \\"alarming\\" assertion that, \\"would, if credited, be a radical departure from our constitutional history and tradition.\\" D.C. Circuit Circuit Judge David S. Tatel wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Circuit Judge Patricia Millett. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao dissented, insisting that the impeachment power is the only legitimate method for such congressional investigations. On November 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit denied the Trump administration's petition for an en banc rehearing. Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao, and Karen Henderson dissented from the denial of rehearing. Supreme Court The question facing the Supreme Court is whether the U.S. House of Representatives has the authority to issue subpoenas to obtain the private financial records of the president and his businesses. On November 25, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States granted a stay of the D.C. Circuit's ruling extending the time for the appealing party (Trump) to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking the Court to hear the case.19A545 TRUMP, DONALD J., ET AL. V. MAZARS USA, LLP, ET AL. supremecourt.gov November 25, 2019 Trump's legal team filed the petition on December 5, 2019, and on December 13, 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the case with Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG. The Supreme Court also granted ceriorari for Trump v. Vance, a similar challenge related to subpoenas for Trump's tax records but from the Manhattan District Attorney's office in relation to the ongoing investigation over the Stormy Daniels scandal. Oral arguments were originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the coronavirus pandemic and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date. In April 2020, the Supreme Court said that oral argument in the Mazars case and other cases would be heard by telephone. Consolidated oral arguments for Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, as well as Trump v. Vance, were heard on May 12. In arguing against the need for subpoenas for tax returns, Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall repeatedly cited that they presented \\"dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President\\". The Court issued its ruling on July 9, 2020. In the 7–2 decision, the Court vacated the decision of the D.C. Circuit that granted the subpoena and remanded the case for further review. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority decision joined by all but Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In the decision, Roberts wrote that the Circuit Court had not taken full account of the separation of powers in their decision, stating that neither the Congressional nor Presidential argument was wholly sound. Roberts wrote, \\"The standards proposed by the president and the solicitor general — if applied outside the context of privileged information — would risk seriously impeding Congress in carrying out its responsibilities...The House's approach fails to take adequate account of the significant separation of powers issues raised by congressional subpoenas for the president's information. Far from accounting for separation of powers concerns, the House's approach aggravates them by leaving essentially no limits on the congressional power to subpoena the president's personal records. Any personal paper possessed by a president could potentially 'relate to' a conceivable subject of legislation, for Congress has broad legislative powers that touch a vast number of subjects.\\" The Chief Justice also noted that conflicts between Congress and the Executive regarding subpoena were resolved in the past by the two political branches of the U.S. federal government through the use of negotiation and compromise and without involvement by the Supreme Court. Roberts recognized that the executive privilege is designed to safeguard presidential decision-making, but he also noted that the U.S. President does not have blanket immunity from records requests, because the protection caused by executive privilege “should not be transplanted root and branch to cases involving nonprivileged, private information, which by definition does not implicate sensitive Executive Branch deliberations.” Congressional subpoenas which are directed at the U.S. President and his personal papers demand careful scrutiny according to Chief Justice John Roberts, “for they stem from a rival political branch that has an ongoing relationship with the president and incentives to use subpoenas for institutional advantage.” In sending the case back to review, Roberts gave the court four considerations to determine whether the subpoenas were appropriate: # Whether the legislative request warrants the involvement of the President, and if other sources can reasonably provide Congress the same information; # Whether the subpoena is no broader than reasonably necessary to support the legislative objective; # Whether the nature of evidence that is requested by the subpoena will advance a valid legislative purpose; and # Whether the subpoena burdens the President and may be a result from partisan politics. Impact The Supreme Court's decision in Mazars was generally considered favorable towards Trump from a political standpoint, even though the rulings in both Mazars and the associated Vance case could allow the tax returns to be subpoenaed. The ruling did acknowledge that Congress has power to subpoena the President and his papers as part of the legislative process, but set limits to these requests, which could be challenged by the President and still prevent release of Trump's taxes. With the challenges to the House subpoenas being returned to the Circuit Court for review based on the four considerations set out by Roberts, these were unlikely to be resolved by the November 2020 presidential election. Trump's political opponents had hoped to have used the tax returns as part of their strategy in challenging the incumbent in the campaign prior to the election. Further, Congressional subpoenas related to this case will expire with the end of the 116th Congress at the start of 2021. The New York Times, through unnamed sources, reported on over two decades of tax information from Trump on September 27, 2020. While the information created a significant discourse over the findings, it is not expected to impact Mazars or the New York Vance case. See also *Department of Justice v.

Murder of Zach Parker Zach Parker was shot dead on 17 January 2019 outside a gym in Applewood Close in Swords. He was driving out of a car park when a gunman shot him and his passenger. Parker, 23, died at the scene and his 25-year-old passenger was taken to Beaumont Hospital. He had been convicted of drug dealing after being caught with almost €3,000 worth of cocaine in February 2017. Gardaí believe the shooting was to do with local drug dealing. Murder of Seán Little Seán Little was shot dead on 21 May 2019 and his body was found beside a burning Opel Insignia at Rowan's Little, near Walshestown, near junction 5 of the M1. He was 22, associated with the leader of a Finglas-based gang and allegedly had close links to Dublin members of the Kinahan gang. The case is being investigated by Gardaí from Balbriggan. Gardaí believe Little was killed because he wanted revenge for the murder of his friend Zach Parker. Murder of Jordan Davis Jordan Davis was shot dead on 22 May 2019 in a laneway off Marigold Road, Darndale. He was bringing his four month old son for a walk in a buggy when he was shot. He was also friends with Seán Little. In June 2019 a man was arrested in connection with his murder and charged. Murder of Hamid Sanambar Hamid Sanambar was shot dead at the home of his friend Seán Little on Kilbarron Avenue in Coolock. He was a known associate of several crime gangs. Gardaí are investigating several lines of inquiry, including the murder being retaliation by another gang or Mr. Sanambar being set up by his own associates. Murder of Eoin Boylan Eoin Boylan was shot dead on 24 November 2019 in the garden of his home on Clonsaugh Avenue, Coolock, around 5:15pm. He had been formally warned by Gardaí that his life was in danger and he was advised to leave the area for safety. He only left for one night. He had survived previous attempts on his life. Gardaí are investigating if comments he may have made about Littles' murder are connected. May 2020 shooting An unnamed man in his 30s was shot on 20 May 2020 on Cromcastle Drive in Coolock. The man was shot around 2pm outside a house, receiving leg wounds. He was attended to by Gardaí and paramedics before being taken to Beaumount Hospital a kilometre away. The target, who is from Cromcastle Estate, had a long history of involvement with crime. Gardaí are not clear if the attack is related to the Coolock feud and they have not ruled out the possibility that it is related to a feud in Darndale. The shooting happened 300m from where Hamid Sanambar was shot dead on Kilbarron Avenue. Arrest and conviction of Stephen Little and Edward McDonnell Arrests On 14 September 2019 Gardaí pulled over a car at Lein Park, Harmonstown and arrested Stephen Little, 47, of Kilbarron Avenue,, Kilmore and Edward McDonnell of Waterside Apartments, New Ross, County Wexford. The Gardaí found they had a semi-automatic pistol, two balaclavas, two baseball bats, gloves, mobile phones, a can of petrol and a long-handled lighter. They were taken to Clontarf Garda station and Little told Gardaí after his arrest \\"had you given me another hour, I would have killed the bastard that killed him\\" and also \\"I lost my marriage and my son\\". Both men had been under surveillance by the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. Trial The trial took place in the non-jury Special Criminal Court. Stephen Little pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a Grand Power G9 semi- automatic pistol at Lein Park, Harmonstown. The court was told that if Little had not made the comment to Gardaí about being given another hour the case against him would have been weaker and he may not have been charged. Edward McDonnell initially pleaded not guilty but on the fifth day of the trial changed his plea to guilty to the same charge. They were jailed for possession of a firearm under suspicious circumstances, an offence under section Section 27A (1) of the Firearms Act. McDonnell had 47 previous convictions, including attempted robbery, sexual assault and assault causing harm. Mr Tony Hunt, the judge, said that the men were involved in serious and organised crime and that the \\"timely intervention\\" of Gardaí had prevented serious harm or death. Sentencing Little was sentenced to six years imprisonment, McDonnell to nine.

Captain Joseph Gold acquired a letter of marque and Cora was commissioned on 26 July. Cora was at Annapolis when on 21 July a large brig, not flying any colours, came to anchor in the mouth of the Severn river. The fort fired on the brig, but she was too far away for the shots to reach. Captain Gold had not yet arrived so Coras Chief Mate, Richard P. Weathers, weighed anchor and stood toward the brig. The brig was , Captain Charles Rubridge, which was bringing some diplomatic mail and was unaware that the United States had declared war on the United Kingdom. As a pilot brought Bloodhound into Annapolis Cora came alongside and took possession of her and brought her under the guns of Fort Madison, a battery on Beaman's Point. Bloodhounds crew were interned in the barracks there and under guard. The United States Government had Bloodhound released to take dispatches back to Plymouth as she was on a diplomatic mission.On 8 July the American privateer Dash had captured , which had come into Hampton Roads with diplomatic dispatches, also unaware of the outbreak of war. The United States Government ordered Whitings release. Fate: The boats of the British squadron blockading the Chesapeake captured Cora on 14 February 1813. In describing Cora, Captain George Burdett of described Cora as being on her first voyage and the fastest vessel out of Baltimore. She was returning from Bordeaux with a valuable cargo of brandy, wine, silks, flints, and the like. She had fired on the boats that captured her, but she had not been able to inflict any casualties.If her captors sent Cora into New Providence, she may have become the British Southern Whale Fishery whaler . (They apparently did not sent her into Halifax, Nova Scotia.) It will require original research to settle the question.

It is maintained by Management Sciences for Health (MSH) on behalf of the World Health Organization. The guide has been published annually since 1986 with the World Health Organization becoming involved in 2000, though has not been updated since 2015. The prices in the guide are specifically for low and middle income countries (LMIC). There are two sources of price data in the guide: Buyers and Suppliers. Buyer prices come from a government agency's competitive (domestic or international) bidding or tendering process. The guide includes these for information purpose only and cautions that buyer prices should not be used as an international reference price. Over thirty buyers are included in the guide. Supplier prices come from the procurement agencies of non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, and government health ministries. Some are international while others serve only the domestic market of one country. The prices generally do not include transportation or insurance costs, and an additional handling fees may be charged by some suppliers. The WHO/HAI project recommends an international reference price is taken from the median of supplier prices. The degree to which this price is representative internationally depends on the quantity of suppliers quoting a price for a given product. Over thirty suppliers are included in the guide. The guide can be used as a source of international reference prices for price surveys. A price survey can compare the local price to this international reference price, and may assess the affordability of treatment in terms of local wages. The WHO/HAI project selects 50 medicines to survey, including 14 global core medicines, 16 regional core medicines and 20 supplementary medicines. When comparing prices, one dosage form and strength is specified for each medicine. To calculate affordability, a typical treatment schedule for a named indication is specified. For example, *Amitriptyline for depression at 25mg in a tablet/capsule. Treatment costs are for 90 tablets (three times a day for a month). *Paracetamol for pain/inflammation (paediatric) at 120mg/5ml suspension. Treatment costs are for 45ml (5ml three times a day for three days). Dividing the median unit local procurement price for each medicine, by the median unit price from international suppliers in the guide, produces the Median Price Ratio (MPR). An MPR of 2 means the local health service is paying twice as much as the international reference price. The international reference price is not indicative of the price paid by locals for medicine. Generally, in the developing world, the availability of medicines (including essential medicines) through the public health sector is low, requiring individuals to purchase from the private sector. The prices in the private sector are often many times (and can be up to 80 times) the international reference price. This makes treatment unaffordable. The prices in the guide are given in US dollars converted using the exchange rate at the time. Exchange rate fluctuations may cause the wide variations in cost over time. External reference pricing is the practice of setting drug prices in one country by comparing to a basket of prices from other countries. The basket prices are ideally drawn from countries in the same global region and similar economy. For example, Pakistan uses prices from Bangladesh and India, while Iran uses prices from Greece, Spain, Turkey and the drug country of origin. Drug price data from LMICs can be lacking, and in such situations, international medicine prices can be obtained from the International Medical Products Price Guide. Some countries use ERP for all drug pricing, and some just for new drugs that are on-patent. In addition to prices, most products in the guide have a defined daily dose (DDD) and ATC code. These are part of a WHO system to help research medicine utilisation. WHO caution that using ATC/DD for purposes other than drug utilisation may be a misuse of that system. The defined daily dose is not a standard therapeutic dose nor necessarily agree with any average prescribed daily dose in practice. While this technical metric could be used, for example, to compare the costs of two formulations of the same drug, WHO state that it should not be used for detailed pricing or therapeutic-class cost comparisons. Both the ACT code and DDD are deliberately stable and if typical therapeutic use of the drug or prescribing practice changes or varies between countries, the codes may not reflect local or current practice.

The riverboat was making its weekly trip between Santarém and Manaus and was claimed to be overcrowded when it sank in Óbidos harbour. It is assumed over 300 people died in the disaster, with hundreds of bodies and body parts never identified. Of 500 people estimated to have been aboard, at least 178 had survived as reported by the Captain, Elio Palhares, that day. In 2014, British angler Jeremy Wade went to Óbidos to investigate the role that local fish species may have played in the loss of life during this disaster; his findings were documented in the River Monsters episode entitled \\"Amazon Apocalypse.\\" After investigating numerous possibilities, including botos (river dolphins), caimans, and piranha, Wade concluded that the culprits were likely hordes of piraiba and redtail (banana) catfish, drawn by chum from nearby fish processing operations, probably joined by the black piranha and other small carnivorous fish. He hypothesized that the large redtails and piraiba pulled the struggling victims underwater, where they drowned.

The convention is organized by Crunchyroll as a means to showcases new attractions and highlights of the industry while bringing together their audience. They have worked with third parties to help organize the event, with Reedpop being the most recent. Programming Crunchyroll Expo main hall has been organized to accommodate merchants along with industry booths, food vendors and the artist alley while also giving it a more lively feeling. The merchants are mostly from the West Coast, with many being regulars at other anime conventions in Northern California. Several indie publishing houses are also present to promote their latest exclusive manga and light novels. The industry booths are organized by major studios and game publishers who are promoting their upcoming releases. Demo booths are available for anyone who wants to try out any upcoming video games. It has also become common for the industry booths to give away free merchandise or host multiple raffles during the day. Food vendors have been set up at different locations of the expo hall and the convention hallways to avoid long lines and over crowding. The artist alley has been organized at the other end of the expo hall. Crunchyroll also has several booths set up selling their original merchandise. Besides merchants and vendors, props and Itasha are on display through out the convention floor. Similar to most major anime conventions, Crunchyroll Expo has been used to unveil upcoming releases and OVA's along with the premier of new seasons. Predominantly done by the streaming service, other studios have also used the event to announce their upcoming titles. The convention also organizes a series of industry and fan panels along with TED Talk inspired presentations from industry figures. Most of the panels follow the standard setup of the host showing a presentation followed by a Q&A; session. Industry panels have featured a discussion about their upcoming work followed by a new trailers then the Q&A; session if there is time. The most popular panels have always been the ones featuring a special guest. One of the highlights of the weekend has been the Masquerade.

He played political rivalry against the traditional Gorkhali courtiers i.e. Tharghars as well as against the Prince Bahadur Shah of Nepal and Queen Rajendra Laxmi. His son Pandit Ranga Nath Poudyal became Mukhtiyar of Nepal. Life Early Life Pandit Vrajanath Poudyal was born on 1810 B.S. The Dhaibung stone inscription of the Shaka year 1704 (1782/1783 A.D.) translated by Sanskrit poet Pandit Harinath Dhungel states that Vrajanath (referred as Vrajanath Sharma) was the son of father Jayamangala Pandit and mother Gauri. The inscription shows that Vrajanath was the eldest son among the five sons of Jayamangala. His other four brothers were - Raghunath, Jagannath, Lokanath and Hari(nath). His son was the well renowned Ranganath Pandit. Political career Pandit Vrajanath was a non-Gorkhali courtier in the Kingdom of Nepal. King Prithvi Narayan Shah appointed Pandit Vrajanath as personal tutor of Crown Prince Pratap Singh Shah in order to teach him polity, Shastras and other relevant studies. However, Vrajanath worked to please the Crown Prince and supported his Tantric practices. He worked with Karmacharyas of Kathmandu as the Guru in the Tantric practice of Pratap Singh. He further suggested the Crown Prince to worship Goddess Guhyeshwari to achieve success in the Tantric cult. King Prithvi Narayan despised the Tantric practices of his eldest son and was irritated by the negative influences of Pandit Vrajanath and Sardar Swarup Singh Karki. He, therefore, referred Pandit Vrajanath and Sardar Swarup Singh in the quote: \\"the Kshetris and the Brahmins of the east and west should not be permitted in the royal court.\\" The non-Gorkhali faction of Pandit Vrajanath, Sardar Swarup Singh and Maiju Rani was heavily disfavoured by the traditional courtiers called Tharghars. However, they remained the most powerful faction in the court due to strong affinity from the nearly similar aged King Pratap Singh. When Pratap Singh Shah became the King of Nepal, the non-Gorkhali faction consisting Sardar Swarup Singh Karki, Pandit Vrajanath and Maiju Rani grew power and influence in the Shah court. After Swarup Singh confined Bahadur Shah of Nepal and Dal Mardan Shah by influencing King Pratap Singh, Pandit Vrajanath enjoyed the privileges of a Chautariya. This non- Gorkhali faction were successful in their intrigues. They did not wish Bahadur Shah to become a Chautariya after his release. They maintained conflict between King Pratap Singh and Prince Bahadur and Prince Bahadur was made a Amali (local administrator) of Dolakha. They curtailed the access of everyone to the King Pratap. When King Pratap Singh died on 6th Marga 1834 B.S. (1777 CE), he was active in the political intrigue to send the legitimate Queen Rajendra Laxmi to Sati. He wanted to rule in the name of the infant King Rana Bahadur Shah.

History Mall of the Bluffs opened in 1986. Developed by General Growth Properties, it was the second mall in the Council Bluffs area after Midlands Mall, which was located downtown and which was redeveloped after Mall of the Bluffs opened. It received two expansions in its history: Dillard's in 1988, and Sears a decade afterward. The mall began losing anchor stores in the 21st century. J. C. Penney moved in 2008, and Target one year later. Barnes & Noble, another major tenant, closed in 2011. One year later, Sears closed as well. General Growth Properties sold the mall to Namdar Realty Group in 2013. At the time of the sale, the mall was nearly 25 percent vacant. Many inline tenants had closed or relocated following the relocation of both J. C.

It is situated north of the Canada–United States border, southeast of Mount MacFarlane, and north- northwest of Slesse Mountain, which is its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Slesse Creek and Nesakwatch Creek, both tributaries of the Chilliwack River. The mountain's name was submitted by Glenn Woodsworth of the Alpine Club of Canada based on the popular cross-over hike from the Pierce Lake trail to the Slesse trail on opposite sides of the peak. The name was officially adopted on May 21, 1981, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Crossover Peak is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Crossover Peak, northwest aspect Based on the Köppen climate classification, Crossover Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Crossover Peak.

It is black and white in color, and it occurs in the Lesser Sundas and Sulawesi in Indonesia. Description Female Gasteracantha interrupta spiders have hardened, shell-like abdomens that are black and white in color and armed with six spines. Friedrich Dahl described this species in 1914 based on five specimens from Sulawesi and Lombok. Dahl distinguished this species from another black-and-white species, the wide-ranging Gasteracantha kuhli, based on a plain white central area on the dorsal side of the abdomen and details of the sigilla. In particular, Dahl noted that the outermost sigilla in the anterior row are very close to the anterior spines, instead of partway between the anterior and median spines. Between those outermost anterior sigilla and the median spines, the abdomen is white, whereas in G. kuhli this area usually has dark coloring. He also noted that the three sigilla extending back from the median spine toward the posterior edge of the abdomen form a concave curve in G. interrupta but a straight line in G. kuhli.

Her notable works include: Wo De Wei Lai Bu Shi Meng, Give My Special Love to the Special You, Follow Your Feeling, Ai Jiu Yi Ge Zi, etc. Chia-Li Chen was active in Taiwan's pop music industry during the 1980s and 1990s, working with top artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong such as: Jacky Cheung, Leslie Cheung, Andy Lau, Chang Yu-Sheng, Jeff Chang, Sky Wu, Harlem Yu, Su Rui, Sandy Lam, Tiger Huang, Tarcy Su, Shirley Kwan, Angus Tung, Matilda Tao, Johnny Yin, Victor Huang, David Liu, Ronald Cheng, Chyi Chin, Tsai Chin, Chiang Yu-Heng, David Wong, Winnie Hsin, Sam Lee, Pauline Lan, Chiang Shu-Na, Cyndi Chaw, Zhao-Mei Tai, Wang Chih-Lei, Tai-Yan Yu, and more.  Career  Chia-Li Chen began her career as a screenwriter working in the China Television Company program Creative Theatre, where she was responsible for planning and naming on the show; her work in the program helped her earn a nomination for the Golden Bell Award in writing sketches. In a stroke of luck, she wrote the commercial jingle “Go with Your Feelings” and unexpectedly entered the pop music industry where she began a fantastic musical career. Her lyrics for Chang Yu-Sheng's “My Future is Not a Dream” was featured in commercials specially presented with lyrical captions which helped achieve record sales. In 1988, missing and runaway children were a social issue in Taiwan. The unusual nature of this occurrence inspired Chia-Li Chen's sense of duty to give back to society and organize “Rediscover Love”. She took on the responsibilities of naming, planning, and organizing the event as well as convincing various record label companies to participate and eventually more than 20 top artists supported the event, including Chyi Yu, Wakin Chau, Harlem Yu, Chiang Yu-Heng, Yeh Huan, Chang Yu-Sheng, Pauline Lan, Tai-Yan Yu, Christine Hsu, Tseng Shu-Chin, Xue Yue, and more; they collectively utilized their influence as musicians to embrace runaway children. Additionally, Chiang Yu-Heng, Harlem Yu, and Pauline Lan also recorded radio commercials calling for children to return to their homes. The event culminated in 2 large outdoor concerts, earning “Rediscover Love” critical acclaim that continues to reverberate today. In the same year, Chia-Li Chen wrote Chang Yu-Sheng's “He Tian Yi Yang Gao” to commemorate the air force's first victory against the Japanese in Hangzhou on August 14, 1937 as well as encourage youths to join the air force. In 1990, Chia-Li Chen founded “Ju Book” and successfully released their first album while establishing Tarcy Su as a fresh new female artist in the songs “I Can Catch Up with Everything” and “I Live by Myself”. In 1995, the shadow of de-China-fication was cast over Taiwanese culture and many traditional Chinese based creators began to migrate from Taiwan. Chia-Li Chen immigrated to Canada for 10 years before moving to Beijing to gain an in- depth experience of life in China. There, she came to know an exceptional ophthalmologist who led his community to provide free care for the Tibetan people of Qinghai and help them restore their vision. The experience moved Chia-Li Chen deeply, inspiring her to write the lyrics to Jeff Chang's single “Wo Kan Jian”. Throughout her career, Chia-Li Chen's lyrical work has rotated between two worlds of absolutes; one was a sea of emotions while the other resembled the radiance of a sunny day.  Style  Her words often depict vivid, movie-like imagery. She is able to expound unique perspectives on love and delicate yet captivating emotions within mesmerizing melodies. She believes that the soul of a song resides in the title and that every melody possesses its own tone of voice. Her creative style is a mastery of establishing a song title and the precise grasp of tone, resulting in the creation of countless classics.  Works  Listing a few representative works by Chen: * 跟著感覺走 * 讓我一次愛個夠 * 我的未來不是夢 * 特別的愛給特別的你 * 愛就一個字 * 忘記你我做不到 * 我碰到你的眼光 * 讓愛人去流浪 * 深海 * 藍雨 * 愛到最高點 * 和天一樣高 * 把愛找回來 * 讓每個人都心碎 * 用情 * 火種 * 以為你都知道 * 走不完的圓 * 停止轉動 * 相思無用 * 在我生命中的每一天 * 愛情鳥 * 貼心收藏 * 像我這樣的人 * 我一個人住 * 回到你身邊 * 九月 * 分不到你的愛 * 天空不要為我掉眼淚 * 心上沒有人 * 不如這樣吧 * 世界的鐘 * 台北玫瑰 * 偷幸福  Awards  {  Year Award - 1990 Nominated for “Song of the Year” in the 1st Golden Melody Awards (“Never Willing to Tell You”, lyrics) - 1992 Nominated for “Song of the Year” in the 3rd Golden Melody Awards (“Give My Special Love to the Special You”, lyrics) - 2010 Nominated for “30 Years, 30 Songs” in the Chinese Music Awards (“Wo De Wei Lai Bu Shi Meng”, lyrics) } References Category:Taiwanese lyricists Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Taiwanese screenwriters ","title":"Chia-Li Chen"},{"id":"62433396","text":"Louis Rorimer (September 12, 1872 – November 30, 1939) was an American artist, an instructor at the Cleveland School of Art, and the founder of Rorimer- Brooks Co. Life Louis Rohrheimer was born to Minnie and Jacob Rohrheimer in 1872, the youngest of seven children. At the age of sixteen, Rohrheimer left to study in Europe at the Königliche Kunstgewerbeschule München in Munich and the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs and Académie Julian in Paris. Rohrheimer returned to Cleveland in 1893, founded Rohrheimer Design in 1896, and taught at the Cleveland School of Art from 1898 to 1936. He married Edith Joseph in 1903, and had two children Louise and James. Rohrheimer changed his name to Rorimer in 1917 due to anti-German and anti-Jewish sentiment. That same year he purchased the Brooks Household Arts Co. and merged it with his own studio to create the Rorimer-Brooks Studios or Rorimer Brooks Co. Work Rorimer produced furniture in a variety of styles. He appreciated Art Deco, but as a businessman focused on his clients' tastes. Rorimer displayed 25 articles of furniture at the Cleveland May Show between 1919 and 1926. The Cleveland Museum of Art holds a silver tea set from the Rorimer Studios in its collection.

He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. Stallman also invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to maintain the free status of a work on modified versions and implemented this through the GNU General Public License (GPL). This license has since been revised twice, known as the GPL Version 2 and Version 3. The courts, mainly in the United States, have since grappled with the copyright, contractual and patent issues resulting from questions of legal validity of the GPL and other such off-shooting open source licenses. This page includes significant open source license litigation to illustrate the courts past and current views on different licences and legal issues. Open source license copyright litigation Jacobsen v Katzer (2008) This was a lawsuit in the United States Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, considering the ability of a copyright holder to control the future distribution and modification of their work where they allow it to be free for public use. Jacobsen made code available for public download under an open source public license, Artistic License 1.0, which Katzer copied into their own commercial software products without recognition of the source of the code. Jacobsen argued that the terms of the license defined the scope what the code could be used for and that any use outside of these restrictions would be a copyright infringement. The license holder here expressly stated the terms upon which the right to modify and distribute the material depended. The Court of Appeals established that these license terms are enforceable copyright conditions. Katzer had failed to affix the required copyright notices to the derivative software, which therefore was an infringement of the license. This case established that violations of open source licenses can be treated as copyright claims. BusyBox litigation (2007-13) During 2007 to 2009, Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) filed a series of copyright infringement lawsuits on behalf the principal developers of BusyBox. These lawsuits claimed violations of the GNU General Public License Version 2. In September 2007 they filed a lawsuit against Monsoon Multimedia, Inc. alleging that Monsoon had violated the GPL by including BusyBox code in some of their products without releasing the source code. In October 2007, an SFLC press release announced that the lawsuit had been settled with Monsoon agreeing to comply with the GPL and pay a sum of money to the plaintiffs. In November 2007 they filed a lawsuit against Xterasys Corporation and High-Gain Antennas, LLC. In December 2007, SFLC announced a settlement; Xterasys agreed to stop shipping infringing products until it published the complete source code for the GPL’d code and to pay an undisclosed sum to the plaintiffs. In December 2007 SFLC filed a lawsuit against Verizon Communications, Inc. alleging that Verizon had violated the GPL by distributing BusyBox in wireless routers bundled with the FiOS fiber optic bandwidth service, without providing corresponding source code. A settlement announced In March 2008, included an agreement to comply with the GPL and an undisclosed sum paid to the plaintiffs. In December 2009, they filed a lawsuit against 14 companies, including Best Buy, Samsung, and Westinghouse with the same allegations of violation of the GPL. By the end of September 2013, all of the defendant companies had agreed on settlement terms, except for Westinghouse, against whom default judgment was entered. Free Software Foundation, Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc (2009) This was a lawsuit initiated by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) against Cisco Systems on December 11, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The FSF claimed that various products sold by Cisco under the Linksys brand had violated the licensing terms of many programs on which FSF held copyright, including GCC, GNU Binutils, and the GNU C Library. Most of these programs were licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2, and a few under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Software Freedom Law Center acted as the FSF's lawyers in the case, asking the court to enjoin Cisco from further distributing Linksys firmware that contained FSF copyrighted code, and also asked for damages amounting from all profits that Cisco received \\"from its unlawful acts.\\" The FSF contended that code to which it held the copyright was found in multiple Linksys models, and in the program QuickVPN. On May 20, 2009 the parties announced a settlement that included Cisco appointing a director to ensure Linksys products comply with free-software licenses, and Cisco making an undisclosed financial contribution to the FSF. Open source license as a contract litigation Artifex Software Inc v Hancom Inc (2017) Leading on from Jacobsen v Katzer this case, from the United States District Court, N.D. California, focused on the breaches of open source software licenses, but extended to contract breaches as well as copyright infringements. Artifex is the exclusive licensor of the software product, ‘Ghostscript’, under a GNU General Public License Version 3. Hancom is a South Korean software company that used Ghostscript in software they were selling. This case concerned Hancom's failure to distribute or offer to provide the source code for their software. The GNU GPL provides that the Ghostscript user agrees to its terms, thus creating a contract, if the user does not obtain a commercial license. Artifex alleged that Hancom did not obtain a commercial license to use Ghostscript, and represented publicly that its use of Ghostscript was licensed under the GNU GPL. These allegations sufficiently plead the existence of a contract. This case establishes that the GNU GPL constitutes a contract between the owner of the source code and the person/company that uses that code through the license. This sets the precedent that allows licensors to bring claims of breach of contract where the terms of a license are not complied with. SCO Group Inc v International Business Machines Corporation (2017) This was a case decided through the United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit. It covered a complex contractual matrix with claims made in tort across the contractual duties. In the end it created a stir in the open source community as the claims of ownership over code were disputed. Eben Moglen, the counsel for the Free Software Foundation, released a statement regarding the lawsuit: > As to its trade secret claims, which are the only claims actually made in > the lawsuit against IBM, there remains the simple fact that SCO has for > years distributed copies of the kernel, Linux, as part of GNU/Linux free > software systems. [...] There is simply no legal basis on which SCO can > claim trade secret liability in others for material it widely and > commercially published itself under [the GNU GPL Version 2] that > specifically permitted unrestricted copying and distribution. The SCO Group announced on May 14, 2003, that they would no longer distribute Linux. SCO said that it would \\"continue to support existing SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux customers and hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux products\\". SCO claimed and maintains that any code that was GPL'd was done by employees without proper authorisation, and thus the license doesn’t stand legally. This is supported by the fact that for code to be GPL'd, the copyright owner must put a GPL notice before the code, and SCO itself was not the one to add the notices. Software patenting litigation Diamond v Diehr (1981), Bilski v Kappos (2010), and Alice Corporation Pty Ltd v CLS Bank International (2014) These cases decided in the Supreme Court of United States set out the law around what makes an invention patent eligible in reference to computer programs. It was stated that to transform an abstract idea into a patent eligible process requires more than simply stating the idea followed by the words, “apply it”; accordingly simply implementing a program on a computer is not a patentable application. This is because if you take away the computer then all that is left is the abstract idea, which is not a process or another accepted creation, and is therefore not patentable. The only place a patent eligible process is qualified by its implementation by a computer is where it improves an existing technological process. So computer programs cannot be patented, but can be copyrighted. The Software Freedom Law Center submitted a brief to the United States Court of Appeals in the Federal Circuit for Alice Corporation v CLS Bank to support the long-standing court precedents limiting patent rights for computer programs. The open source community has an interest in limiting the reach of patent law so that free software development is not impeded upon. The SFLC showed its support for the “machine or transformation” test which only allows patents for computer software processes which include a special purpose apparatus not merely a general purpose computer to execute the program. The Court’s decision reflected the ideas set out in the SFLC submission. Enfish LLC v Microsoft Corp (2016) Is an example of a case where a software patent’s eligibility was questioned, and it came out on top. Enfish proved that their program was sufficiently improving the technology. This United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit case highlighted that an invention’s ability to run on a general-purpose computer does not preclude it from being patent eligible. This could be seen as a threat by the open source community. Antitrust litigation Wallace v. International Business Machines Corp (2006) This case was decided, at the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, that in United States law the GNU GPL Version 2 did not contravene federal antitrust laws. This suit came after the dismissed action, Wallace v Free Software Foundation (2006), where the Foundation and the GPL Version 2 specifically came under fire for price fixing. Wallace’s argument was that the ‘copyleft’ system created by the Free Software Foundation is a project with IBM, Novell and Red Hat to undercut the prices of potential rivals. It was argued that this could be governed under antitrust law which regulates predatory pricing. The effect would be to shut down a process where a company or companies undercut the competition to gain a monopoly, and then exploit it by raising the prices. The purpose of the law is to protect consumers from this process, to promote rivalry to keep prices low. However, Mr Wallace was attempting to use anti-trust law to drive prices up, suggesting that it was impossible to compete with their prices. Wallace had to prove not only an injury to himself but to the market as well under antitrust law, which he failed to do. The claim was quickly dismissed as the number of proprietary operating systems was growing, and there continues to be competition in the market despite some being free of charge. So it was confirmed that the GPL and open source software cannot be challenged by antitrust laws. Open source software fair use litigation  Oracle America Inc V Google Inc (2018)  This was a case finally decided in the United States Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018, which concerned the fair use by Google of the source code licensed by Oracle under the GNU GPL Version 2. Google had copied 37 Application Programming Interface packages (API’s) to aide in the building of its free Android software for smartphones. Google had taken these API’s and then written its own implementing code and launched a product which competed with Oracle’s. The conditions of the license were that the improvements of the code, or derivative code, had to be shared for free use. If somebody wanted to avoid this, but still use the API’s, or where they would be competing with the owners of the code, then they would need to pay a licensing fee. Google used the API’s without paying a licensing fee, but competed with Oracle’s product, which Oracle contended was a breach of copyright. The Court of Appeals decided in favour of Oracle, after considering what would make a fair use of the code, with Google failing on a majority of accounts. As of November 15th 2019 the United States Supreme Court has decided to allow appeal to its court on the same question, which now holds $9 billion in damages above Google if they fail again. Open source software trade secrets litigation A Korean case (2005) from the Seoul Central District Court in September, 2005 considered the issue of defendants conducting business for a rival company using source code from a program developed by the company they had previously worked, licensed under a GNU GPL Version 2. Trade secrets are sufficient if their contents are of competitive property value and, unlike patents, are not required to be novel or progressive. The purpose of prohibiting trade secret infringement is to avoid unfair advantage, stopping companies from obtaining a favourable head- start over competitors placing them in a superior position. One defendant retired from their company and kept a copy of the source code privately, providing it to the rival company, shortening the development period by two months. The Court ruled that the GPL was not material to the case. The Defendants argued that it is impossible to maintain trade secrets while being compliant with GPL and distributing the work, so they could not be in breach of trade secrets. This argument was considered without ground and the defendants were sentenced following criminal proceedings. Other/international open source license litigation Planetary Motion v. Techsplosion (2001) United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit case, “Software distributed pursuant to [the GPL] is not necessarily ceded to the public domain” (dicta). Computer Associates v. Quest (2004) This case decided in the United States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Eastern Division considered the fact that Computer Associate’s source code contains previously known source code (GNU Bison Version 1.25), available under the GPL, does not prevent them from protecting their own source code. There is a special exception in the GPL to allow the use of output files without the usual restrictions for versions of Bison after and including version 1.25. Welte v. Sitecom Germany (2004) In April 2004 a preliminary injunction against Sitecom Germany was granted by Munich District Court after Sitecom refused to cease distribution of Netfilter's GPL'ed software in violation of the terms of the GPL Version 2. The court's justification was: > Defendant has infringed on the copyright of plaintiff by offering the > software 'netfilter/iptables' for download and by advertising its > distribution, without adhering to the license conditions of the GPL. Said > actions would only be permissible if defendant had a license grant. Welte v. D-Link (2006) On 6 September 2006 in the District Court of Frankfurt, the gpl-violations.org project prevailed in court litigation against D-Link Germany GmbH regarding D-Link's copyright-infringing use of parts of the Linux Kernel in devices they distributed. The judgment stated that the GPL is valid, legally binding, and stands in German court. AFPA v. Edu4 (2009) September 22, 2009 the Paris Court of Appeals made ruled that the company Edu4 violated the terms of the GNU GPL Version 2 when it distributed binary copies of the remote desktop access software VNC but denied users access to its corresponding source code. Olivier Hugot, attorney of Free Software Foundation France said: > Companies distributing the software have been given a strong reminder that > the license's terms are enforceable under French law. And users in France > can rest assured that, if need be, they can avail themselves of the legal > system to see violations addressed and their rights respected...But what > makes this ruling unique is the fact that the suit was filed by a user of > the software, instead of a copyright holder. It's a commonly held belief > that only the copyright holder of a work can enforce the license's terms - > but that's not true in France. People who received software under the GNU > GPL can also request compliance, since the license grants them rights from > the authors. Free/Iliad (2011) This was an October 2008 case from Paris Regional Court (Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris). Free/Illiad is an ISP; the routers they distribute contains software under GPL Version 2, but Free/Iliad didn't provide the source code nor the GPL text. Free/Illiad's argument was that the routers are their property (not sold to customers) and still on their network, which would not amount to \\"distribution\\" in the terms of the GPL. A secret extra-judicial agreement was reached in July 2011. Free has since released the source code and informed users of the GPL software in their routers. China's courts rulings on open-source licensing (2018) The Beijing Intellectual Property Court (BIPC) saw a case from business-software developer Digital Heaven claiming that software developer YouZi had copied the code for three plug-ins contained in its development tool \\"Hbuilder\\". The court found in 2018 that YouZi violated copyright, this decision proving to be controversial as the legal test employed by the court differed from the reasoning used by the United States courts. YouZi argued that since Hbuilder is based on a GNU open-source module known as \\"Aptana\\", which is licensed under General Public Licence Version 3; HBuilder is also open source software with source code anybody should be entitled to use. The BIPC decided it was only necessary to identify whether the three specific plug-ins used by YouZi are subject to the GPL. The Aptana-GPL Exception License stipulates that the works which are identifiable sections of the modified version and can be seen as independent works, would not fall under the GPL. Without further examination of the open source licences, the court ruled the GPL did not apply to the three plug-ins and therefore Hbuilder could not be considered a derivative work licensed under the GPL.

He is currently playing under contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). In 2019, he was named to the Ontario Hockey League First All Star Team. Playing career Early career Hollowell played 38 games with the Niagara Rivermen Minor Midget hockey club, where he tallied 8 goals and 19 assists for 27 points. He then played one season of junior B hockey with the Niagara Falls Canucks under the leadership of Frank Pietrangelo. He was eventually drafted by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the 12th round of the 2014 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection Draft. Hollowell recorded his first career OHL goal on December 28, 2014, against the Saginaw Spirit. He ended his rookie season totalling two goals and four assists in 11 games. Although eligible for the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Hollowell went undrafted. However, he drew some interests from the Toronto Maple Leafs who invited him to their prospect camp during the summer. He returned to the Greyhounds where he ended the 2017–18 season fifth amongst leading scoring OHL defencemen with 12 goals and 44 assists in 63 games. Due to his play, Hollowell was drafted in the fourth round of the 2018 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was invited to attend the Toronto Marlies training camp but was returned to the Greyhounds prior to the 2018–19 season. Prior to the start of his season as an overager, Hollowell was named an alternate captain alongside Jordan Sambrook and Morgan Frost. Hollowell finished his final season in the OHL with 24 goals, 53 assists, and 77 points in 64 games. As a result, he was selected for the OHL First All-Star Team. Professional On March 7, 2019, the Maple Leafs signed Hollowell to an entry level contract. At the conclusion of his OHL career, Hollowell joined the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League during their Calder Cup run. Upon making the jump to professional hockey, Hollowell remarked \\"The guys are bigger and older and positionally smarter, so I’m just trying to find ways to play my game. It’s definitely been a big adjustment, but I like it.\\" After attending the Toronto Maple Leafs training camp, Hollowell was reassigned to the Marlies for the 2019–20 season. However, he began the season with the Leafs ECHL affiliate, the Newfoundland Growlers. On October 6, 2019, Hollowell recorded his first career ECHL goal in an overtime win against the Reading Royals. He made his AHL regular season debut in an 8–5 win over the Texas Stars on November 16, 2019. However, on November 24 he was reassigned to the ECHL. Personal life Hollowell was born to parents Jenn Sheldon and Len Hollowell.

His best-known works appeared in Viennese satirical magazines such as Kikeriki and Der Floh, and in the American magazine Puck. Puck was the first magazine to print cartoons in color. Many of Graetz's cartoons were political, targeting issues of government responsibility and public health and urging social change.  Career  Graetz studied art in Frankfurt am Main with Eduard von Steinle. In 1867 Graetz came to Vienna, spending time also in Budapest.  Vienna  Graetz worked for the satirical weekly Kikeriki (\\"Cock-a-doodle-doo\\") in Vienna between 1872 and 1875, and for Der Floh (\\"The Flea\\"), also in Vienna, beginning in 1875. Both magazines were printed by the publishing house Johann Nepomuk Vernay. Kikeriki was edited by Ottokar Franz Ebersberg, under the pseudonym O. F. Berg. In its early years, Kikeriki used humour to critique authority and call for social change. It has been suggested that over time humour in Kikeriki and other Viennese newspapers shifted, becoming less an appeal to improve city life, and more an attempt to cope with its stresses by \\"keeping up a cheerful spirit\\". Their humour also became increasingly distanced and negative toward marginalized groups, including women and Jewish people.  Puck  Graetz was hired by Joseph Keppler on a three-year contract, to work for the popular magazine Puck in New York. Keppler, who was also from Austria, established the German-language magazine in 1871, publishing the first English-language edition in 1877. Graetz's illustrations appear in Puck between March 1882 and March 1885. Graetz's images, like those of Joseph Keppler and Carl Edler von Stur in Puck, depict complex scenes in which a number of characters are involved in unfolding action. In Puck, as in the early Kikeriki, humor was intentionally used to press for both political and social change. Topics reflected the interests and political positions of Keppler and other senior staff, and Keppler closely reviewed others' work before it went to publication, influencing both content and style with \\"a strong guiding hand\\". Among the areas of public health addressed by Friedrich Graetz's cartoons in Puck are unsanitary conditions; disease, quarantine and immigration; and adulteration of foodstuffs. \\"The Anti-Chinese Wall\\" , March 29, 1882 Graetz's cartoon \\"The Anti-Chinese Wall: The American wall goes up as the Chinese original goes down\\" caricatures a group including Irish, African American, French, and Jewish laborers. They are shown building a wall against the Chinese at the same time that the Chinese are removing their own barriers to trade. The lettering on the blocks includes \\"Fear\\", \\"Non Reciprocity\\", \\"Law Against Race\\" and \\"Congressional Blunders\\". Congress had passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, and was manipulating prejudice and fear against minority groups to support anti-Chinese trade policies. Graetz's cartoon has been used to examine recurring political debates across time. \\"The Kind of 'Assisted Emigrant' We Can Not Afford to Admit\\" , Puck, July 18, 1883 Cholera was particularly feared for its high rate of mortality, and because its cause of infection was not yet known. A major epidemic was occurring in Egypt at the time this cartoon was drawn. Graetz's illustration \\"The Kind of 'Assisted Emigrant' We Can Not Afford to Admit\\" personifies cholera as a skeletal invader in the foreground of the cartoon, but does not demonize or blame immigrants. The deadly disease is opposed by an array of tiny figures: a boat representing the Board of Health, cannons loaded with carbolic acid, thymol and chloride of lime, and a frail line of human defenders. The building in the illustration has been identified as Castle Clinton, an immigrant processing center in the Battery Park area of New York City. \\"An appalling attempt to muzzle the watch-dog of science\\" , March 14, 1883 A flag entitled \\"Freedom of thought\\" flies above the conflict in Friedrich Graetz's cartoon \\"An appalling attempt to muzzle the watch-dog of science\\" (1883). The caption notes that The Society for the Suppression of Blasphemous Literature proposed to prosecute professors such as physicist John Tyndall, biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, and sociologist Herbert Spencer for sowing \\"widespread unbelief, and in some cases rank atheism\\" through the expression of their views on science and religion. In the cartoon, Spencer is shown as a monumental dog, guarding the doors of scientific enlightenment. His detractors surround him with muzzles. \\"The Alchemist of the Past, and the Alchemist of the Present\\", April 2, 1884 Graetz's cartoon \\"The Alchemist of the Past, and the Alchemist of the Present\\" targeted food adulteration practices by commercial chemists and hinted at the need for regulation, as a matter of public health. The Alchemist of the Past, as noted in the illustration, could not make gold out of anything, but the Alchemist of the Present profits by making things out of almost everything. In the cartoon \\"Dr. Cashdown Mixer, Analytical Chemist\\" is collecting payments from a number of well-dressed gentlemen, while above him on the wall are the results of some of his work, \\"Analysis Tea,\\" \\"Analysis Coffee,\\" and \\"Analysis Oilymargarine\\". \\"Coffee\\" is listed as consisting predominantly of chicory and beans, while \\"flour\\" consists almost entirely of plaster of paris and chalk. Eugene Zimmerman recalls Graetz as \\"an elderly gentleman with short-cropped hair and abundant red whiskers.\\" Zimmerman considered Graetz to be \\"an excellent pen-and-ink artist but too careful in detail for an American comic paper\\". Graetz was unfamiliar with American politics, and was often given topics dealing with international affairs. Because he spoke little or no English, proposed work had to be described to him extremely precisely by a German-speaking staff member. While Keppler was travelling abroad for six months in 1883, Zimmerman acted as Graetz's translator. Keppler and his staff, as caricatured by himself. Graetz wears a toga. Keppler caricatured himself and his staff in \\"The return of the 'prodigal father' at the 'Puck\\" office'\\", a cartoon published on October 10, 1883. Graetz is portrayed among the members of the art department, to the left of Keppler. He is dressed in a toga as the Greek painter Apelles. Over time, Graetz drew fewer lithographs. Zimmermam became increasingly skilled, and was seen by Keppler and his partner Adolph Schwarzmann as a possible replacement. Keppler, however, felt uncomfortable about firing his friend. According to Zimmerman, when it was time to renew Graetz's contract, the proprietors of Puck proposed to cut Graetz's salary in half. Humiliated, he chose to leave and return to Europe. A few months later, Zimmerman left Puck as well.  Europe  Two other similarly named artists were active in Austria and Germany during Friedrich Graetz's lifetime (1842–1912). Friedrich Graetz has been credited with publishing during the periods 1885–1891 in Lustigen Blätter (\\"Funny Leaves\\", Hamburg and Berlin) and 1896–1897 in Der Wahre Jacob (Stuttgart, Germany). However, Ursula E.

The older building, known as the Malt Chamber, is from 1881 and was designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup. The other one, Storage Cellar 3, was built to a Functionalist design in 1969. Both buildings are listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. The hotel opened in 2019. It takes its name after Ottilia Jacobsen, the wife of second generation Carlsberg brewer Carl Jacobsen. History The old part of the building in c. 1885. The section to the left was demolished in 1969 to make way for Storage Cellar 3. In 1870, J. C. Jacobsen's Carlsberg Brewery was extended with an annexed brewery, which was leased by J. C. Jacobsen's son Carl Jacobsen after disagreements with his father. In 1880 J. C. Jacobsen terminated his son's lease and Carl founded his own brewery on a neighbouring premises. With his father's consent he named it Ny Carlsberg (New Carlsberg), while Carlsberg's name was changed to Gammel Carlsberg (English: Old Carlsberg). The oldest of the two buildings in which the hotel is now based is from 1881. It was used both as brewhouse, machine house and malt storage. The tower at the corner with Pasteursvej was a watertower. The adjacent part of the building contained residences for unmarried brewery workers. Living at the brewery enabled them to serve as fire guards. A new Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse was in 1901 completed on the other side of By Carlsbergvej. The newer of the two buildings in which the hotel is based is known as Stoage Celler 3 (Lagerkælder 3). It was constructed in 1969. The building replaced an older building at the site. It had room for 6 million litres of beer. The tanks were removed in 1995 and the building was then used as archives and storage space. Architecture Dahlerup's building from 1881 The old part of the building is constructed in red brick with arched windows, A Lomvard band is seen under the roof. The tower is topped by a tall roof lantern crowned by a copy of the Ancient Greek statue Praying Boy (original in Altes Museum). Storeage Cellar 3 under conversion into its new use Storage Cellar 3 was designed by Svenn Eske Kristensen. The facade towards Pasteursvej is dominated by60 golden mosaic discs in 5 rows, representing the horizontally placed, culindrical tanks(with golden beer) with the same diameter that were originally located on the other side of the wall. The buildings were adapted for their new use as hotel by Poul Schülein from Arkitema Architects in collaboration with professor Christoffer Harlang from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. The challenge of letting daylight into Storage Cellar 3 towards Pasteursvej was solved by creating tall, narrow windows on each side of the discks. On the other side of the building, towards Bryggernes Torw, each of the discks were complemented by shallow , round niches in the brickwork. These have been replaced by round windows. Busts The groundfloor of the building features a number of busts on its facade. The people seen on the facade of the old building include Louis Pasteur (by Paul Dubois), Gabriel Sedlmayr (by Ferdinand Miller) and Emil Christian Hansen (Nicolai Outzen Schmidt), The bust on the facade of Storage Cellar 3 depicts a number of members of the Jacobsen family, including I. C. Jacobsen, Carl Jacobsen and Ottilia Jacobsen. They were originally located on the building that was demolished in 1969 but transferred to its the new one.

List Not all prime ministers live to become the oldest of their time. Of the 49 deceased prime ministers, 30 eventually became the oldest of their lifetime, while 19 did not (including 4 of the 7 prime ministers who died in office, Earl of Wilmington, Henry Pelham, and Viscount Palmerston being the only exceptions). Henry Addington became the oldest living prime minister when Duke of Grafton died in 1811 and remained so until his death in 1844, for a record of almost 33 years. Edward Heath became the oldest living prime minister after the death of James Callaghan, but he survived Callaghan by only 113 days. On two occasions the oldest living prime minister lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a prime minister who was older. Robert Walpole lost this distinction when Earl of Wilmington was appointed, then a year later when Wilmington died in office Walpole regained it until his own death in 1745 for a total period of 22 years, and 207 days. Earl of Rosebery lost it when Henry Campbell-Bannerman was appointed, but regained it when Campbell-Bannerman died. Consequently, Rosebery too was the oldest living prime minister twice: first from 1903 to 1905 (after the death of Lord Salisbury), and a second time after Campbell- Bannerman's death in 1908 until his own death in 1929 for a total period of 23 years, and 134 days. Edward Heath was the oldest to acquire this distinction when he did so only a few days off the age of 89. Anthony Eden, who was 79 years and 216 days old when he died, was the oldest prime minister to die without also being the oldest prime minister. Harold Wilson who died on 24 May 1995 at 79 years and 74 days old, is the most recent prime minister to die without ever acquiring this distinction. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\" Prime minister !colspan=2 align=\\"center\\" Time as oldest living !colspan=2 align=\\"center\\" Age !rowspan=2 align=\\"center\\" Duration (years, days) - !

Accommodations and transportation  * Similar cases of delays and inadequacies in transportation and accommodations occurred upon the arrivals of the Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Timor-Leste national football teams, who were among the first set of athletes to arrive in the country ahead of the tournament, during the weekend of 23–24 November 2019: ** Pictures surfaced on social media of the Timor-Leste national football team waiting for their team bus to fetch them from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, upon their arrival on 23 November. Their bus reportedly fetched them two and a half hours later than scheduled, which then transported them to the incorrect hotel they were billeted at. ** The Myanmar national football team, who arrived in Manila a few hours after the Timorese team, reportedly also waited excessively for their bus to fetch them at the airport. In addition, they complained that their bus, a minibus, was \\"cramped\\" and uncomfortable. Myanmar-based media sources reported that the team was unable to hold their first training session due to the delays. ** The Thailand national football team, through a Facebook post from the Football Association of Thailand, complained about the limited and repeated food and water rations provided to them at their hotel, as well as the disorganization of their hotel rooms, having to accommodate three players into rooms designed to accommodate a maximum of only two. In response, association president Somyot Poompanmoung was notified of their situation and ordered the association to provide the team more food. PHISGOC also responded by saying that they would provide more water bottles. Head coach Akira Nishino also revealed that the team was prompted to cancel their first training session due to heavy traffic and the distance between their hotel in Manila, Century Park Hotel, and the training grounds at the UP Diliman Football Field in Quezon City, forcing the team to train on the streets outside of their hotel. ** Pictures circulated online of the Cambodia national football team sleeping on the carpeted floor of the private conference room at their hotel. Head coach Felix Darmas revealed that they waited for about eight to nine hours. ** In response, PHISGOC sent an official statement issuing an apology to the four teams, following a direct complaint from the Timor-Leste football team. Century Park Hotel, the designated hotel for the Cambodian and Thai delegations, also responded by stating that there were no arrangements made with the PHISGOC regarding early check-ins for the teams, as some teams such as Timor-Leste's arrived a few hours before their check-in time. Century Park also addressed the limited and repeated food and water rations offered to the Thai delegation, by stating that a cycle menu for the SEA Games delegation as well as two bottles of water per day to be supplied per person based on hotel industry standards was prepared. On 26 November, Vallacar Transit CEO Leo Yanson, who also owns the local football club Ceres–Negros F.C., coordinated with the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) to lend 17 coaches intended for the transport of the national teams for the remainder of the tournament in lieu of the minibuses arranged by PHISGOC. PAREF Southridge School in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila offered its artificial turf to be used by the teams for training sessions. * A number of local volunteers for the SEA Games complained about the lack of updates on the status of their deployment and expressed confusion regarding the transportation arrangement for their travel to the venues. The PHISGOC initially announced that they would provide Premium Point-to-Point Bus Services for the volunteers, although they clarified that they would be unable to provide accommodations and other modes of transportation for them. On 25 November 2019, SEA Games volunteer program head Chris Tiu responded that the lack of updates on the status of the volunteers' deployment was due to the numerous cases of missing requirements amongst volunteers. Tiu, however, reassured that they were finalizing their schedules. He added that the schedules would dictate the pickup points for the transportation of the volunteers. * Indonesian broadcasting service Voice of Indonesia reported that the Indonesia national polo team waited for three hours at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport for their transport to fetch them to their hotel. * Logistics woes hounded the arrival of the women volleyball players of Thailand. They were stranded at the airport upon arrival at NAIA.  Provision of meals  * The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos claimed that the PHISGOC had disregarded its recommendation to assist in the service of halal-certified meals, as well as the provision of segregated prayer rooms equipped with a qibla, for Muslim delegates during the tournament. It followed complaints from the Singaporean delegation, who issued a letter to PHISGOC regarding the lack of halal food options in their accommodations. The South China Morning Post reports that Muslim athletes and officials from Singapore were served kikiam, which contains ground pork that Muslims are prohibited from consuming, only to rectify it after Singapore clarifies that their Muslim athletes were not served pork. The head chef at the Athletes Village at New Clark City Sports Hub has also assured that all the meals served in the village would be fully halal-certified after consultation with the nutritionists of some of the delegations. * An Indonesian Muslim media officer in the delegation of the Indonesia national football team complained that he was accidentally served a pork dish, claiming that PHISGOC could not make the distinction between halal-certified and non- halal meals. * The Malaysian contingent decided to prepare food from Malaysia after the host failed to guarantee that halal food would be served during the event. It was also reported that Malaysian journalists had difficulty in sourcing halal food and the Sportswriters Association of Malaysia has resorted to eating halal canned food. * On November 26, a report from GMA News's 24 Oras stated that the Philippine women's football team coach complained over kikiam with rice and egg being served as a breakfast by the SEA Games organizers. The hotel later explained that the kikiam was actually chicken sausage, and that it was part of a buffet that included other food as well as an egg omelette station. The hotel claimed in a statement that the coach later apologized to the hotel for the error. * Jacob Joseph and Mai Đức Chung, the head coaches of the Malaysian and Vietnamese women's football teams respectively, shared that the Malaysian team only had \\"bread and some egg\\" served to them for breakfast. Chung requested for additional food and police escorts for the Vietnamese team en route to a training session at the Biñan Football Stadium, claiming that traffic was affecting their training schedules.  Financial concerns  * There were reports in March 2019 that the Philippines might lose hosting rights of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games due to budgetary concerns and an alleged leadership dispute within the Philippine Olympic Committee. The proposed budget allotted for the games has been cut down by Senate to from . The chairman of the organizing committee Alan Peter Cayetano, who is also the Speaker of the House of Representatives, has assured that the hosting will push through citing support from the private sector and continued efforts by the organizers to secure government funding for the games. * There was allegation of corruption by the PHILSOC Foundation led by Alan Peter Cayetano particularly it entered in an allegedly overprice deal regarding athlete uniform and sporting equipment. The Philippine government said that there could not be any corruption since it is the Philippine Sports Commission and the Department of Budget and Management are responsible for disbursement of funds in the games. * Netizens criticized the PHISGOC's choice of venue for the bowling events, Starmall EDSA Shaw in Mandaluyong. Many claimed that the choice favoured the Villar political family who own the Filipino real estate company Vista Land, the parent company of Starmall. PHISGOC chairman, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, denied the claim by clarifying that the bowling alley to be used during the events is operated by a different firm. Cayetano justified the PHISGOC's choice of venue as having met World Bowling standards. * Senate Minority Floor Leader Franklin Drilon questioned the (US$1 million) budget allotted for the construction of the cauldron. During the plenary deliberations of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's (BCDA) budget for the 2019 SEA Games at the Philippine Senate, Drilon lamented that the budget could have been used for other purposes of national importance, such as the construction of classrooms instead. Senator Sonny Angara, chairman of the Senate finance committee, defended the budget by saying that the cauldron is intended to showcase Filipino ingenuity. Senator Bong Go, chairman of the Senate sports committee, added that the government plans to lease out the cauldron after the event. President Rodrigo Duterte denied corruption allegations over its construction and reiterated Angara's claim, even adding that the PHISGOC commissioned Francisco Mañosa, a National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture, to design the cauldron. Alan Peter Cayetano denied that the budget for the cauldron was overpriced and said that it was cheaper than the cauldron constructed for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games in Singapore, which cost around ($1.2 million). * In November 2019, the BCDA denied involvement in a funding scheme with the Malaysian investment holding firm MTD Capital Berhad for the construction of some facilities in the New Clark City Sports Hub. Local media sources reported that the firm would receive half of the shares earned from the usage of the facilities, estimated to be in return. While the Philippine Competition Commission had approved the joint venture between the BCDA and MTD for the construction of the National Government Administrative Center in March, the BCDA claimed that none of the firm's sources of finance originated from the Philippine government. Instead, the Philippine government opted to pay MTD in full in order to avoid accrued interest, according to the BCDA's official statement. The BCDA admitted that they had yet to pay the firm.  Health and safety  * A volunteer construction worker at the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila fell from a scaffolding he was dismantling, hours before the first football match at the stadium, due to heavy rains. The worker was admitted to the nearby Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, where the attending physician declared that he had suffered a fractured skull and a blood clot in his head. The worker claimed that his team was \\"forced to work nearly 24 hours on a single stretch\\" as they were behind schedule. * Faiq Bolkiah, team captain of the Brunei national football team and the nephew of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, was admitted to the Manila Doctors Hospital in Ermita, Manila on the evening of 24 November after suffering a peanut allergy. An official from the Brunei football team's medical staff stated that Faiq's allergic reaction originated from a curry dish served for dinner at his hotel, causing swelling of his lips. Following the incident, the medical official requested the organizers to list the ingredients of every meal served. Faiq has since fully recovered from the incident. *Muhammad Faizul M. Nasir, Malaysian athlete, was injured in the face after being kicked in the face which was an illegal move in Pencak silat by while sparring against host athlete Dines Dumaan in the second round of the Putra B class (50–55 kg) pencak silat event on Tuesday. He fell unconscious on the ground for three whole minutes. Faizul who won two gold in 2017, was rushed to The Medical City Clark for further treatment. Dumaan was declared the winner with 5-0. Faizul has undergone a CT scan and is now fully conscious and in stable condition  Infrastructure and logistical delays  * On 21 November 2019, nine days before the start of the 2019 SEA Games, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano confirmed that preparations at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Manila and venues in Tagaytay remain incomplete. He cited delays in the passage of spending bills containing the SEA Games budget in the Congress of the Philippines, which in turn delayed the governmental procurement process. Cayetano reassured that the PHISGOC was prepared to activate contingent venues should the original venues not be completed in time. ** On 25 November, hours before the first men's football match between Malaysia and Myanmar, the media center at the Rizal Memorial Stadium was reported to have remained unfurnished. Despite that, media personnel were accommodated. A Malaysian official reported that the dressing rooms were still under renovation. Scaffolding were also visible in the facade of the stadium during that time, although it was reportedly removed only minutes before the match. The match between Malaysia and Myanmar went on without any main score board in the stadium. ** Squash doubles events including men's jumbo doubles, women's jumbo doubles and mixed doubles were axed from the Games as the host was unable to get the squash court at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex ready on time, while there are no other doubles and jumbo doubles facilities in the country. The squash events will be held at the Manila Polo Club instead of the original venue, and will see the addition of team competitions for both men and women to replace the previously scrapped doubles events. * On 5 December 2019, live broadcasting for a football match between Indonesia and Laos was canceled just one hour before the kick-off, citing logistical and cost constraints as the cause. RCTI, Indonesian broadcaster set to live stream the match, resorted to Facebook live stream service due to the incident. Later, due to unreliability of the live stream, they had to comment on the match without the live video.  Marketing  * The logo and mascot received overwhelming backlash and heavy criticism, mostly from Filipinos, who cited that it shows a lack of creativity.  Organization  * Vietnam criticized the exclusion of athletics events namely women's long jump, high jump, heptathlon, the marathon, the men's and women's 10,000m race which they consider as traditional events as \\"unreasonable\\". The marathon in particular has featured in every iteration of the games since the first edition in 1896. *The Vietnam Football Federation filed a complaint regarding the seeding of the Vietnam national team in Pot 4 for the men's football tournament draw along with Laos, Cambodia, Brunei and Timor-Leste. They questioned how could Vietnam which collected 10 points in the group stage of the 2017 edition of the games or higher than the two teams seeded Pot 3 (Myanmar with 9 points and Singapore with 6 points). Vietnam was later elevated to Pot 3 and Singapore relegated to Pot 4. * Wrestling Association of the Philippines (WAP) President Alvin Aguilar alleged PHISGOC Executive Director Tom Carrasco of sabotage regarding the exclusion of wrestling from the games. Aguilar said that Carrasco trimmed the number of events in wrestling including grappling events which WAP concluded that the Philippines has strong chances of performing well before excluding it from the games altogether. Carrasco refuted saying that wrestling's international federation, United World of Wrestling (UWW) should have signed the sport's events handbook for the games. Aguilar said that UWW did indeed signed the document by its Vice President, but Carassco insists it should be the organization's president. Wrestling was reinstated after the game organizers received a letter from UWW Secretary General Michel Dusson regarding its consent to include the sport in the games. * The late decision taken by host Philippines for changes of several tournament venues to the capital of Manila dissatisfied the Malaysian contingent as expressed by their Chef-de-Mission to the Games, Megat Zulkarnain Omardin as it would have an impact on their logistics since the capital was already crowded. The Chef-de-Mission added that the host also still did not distribute technical handbooks on the events that were supposed to be handed out earlier to every competing country for their preparation, which was causing problems for athletes and officials to manage their schedules ahead of the tournament. * On 25 November, spectators attending the men's football match between the Philippines and Cambodia at the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila expressed difficulty in retrieving their belongings from security personnel after the match. Spectators were prohibited from bringing their bags into the stadium and were asked to deposit it at a single baggage counter outside the stadium, thus experiencing a large crowd for which many complained about. Spectators also complained about the lack of restrooms inside the stadium. The management had deployed several portable toilets outside the stadium in an attempt to recompense the lack of restrooms. * Gymnastics judge Linzi Arellano-Co complained that she personally had to borrow chairs and tables from her mother to be used for the gymnastics competitions. * Pamela Mejia, a Filipino social entrepreneur, revealed PHISGOC’s disadvantageous offer of purchasing 5,000 woven bags made by female weavers who are persons with disability. She claimed that when her company presented its price, PHISGOC replied asking if they will allow a price that is acceptable enough to help the country (\\"para sa bayan\\"), which is PHP50.00 per bag (or approximately USD1.00 in 2019 exchange rate). She decried what she perceived as an unfair amount when the cauldron at the New Clark City Athletics Stadium cost PHP50 million (USD1 million in 2019 exchange rate).  Weather conditions  * On 28 November 2019, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the storm internationally known as Kammuri had developed into a typhoon and entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 30 November (when the Games' opening ceremony occurs), in which it would bear the local name Tisoy. Kammuri later made landfall in the province of Sorsogon on 2 December, which brought frequent heavy rains across Metro Manila and the regions of Central Luzon and Calabarzon, all of which are locales of the Games. PAGASA left the decision to cancel or postpone certain outdoor sports events of the Games to PHISGOC. Typhoon Kammuri exited the PAR by 5 December, according to PAGASA. **The mixed relay event in triathlon was rescheduled from December 4 to December 2.  False news  Several reports on alleged mishaps in the days leading up to the official opening of the games were found to be misleading or false. The reports were slammed as \\"fake news\\" by critics of these reports, and the Congress of the Philippines vowed to summon the authors and propagators of these reports after the event. Some such news was critical of the Games, and some was in support of PHISGOC. * According to a South China Morning Post article, the Muslim officials and athletes were reported to have been served non-halal food, prompting Juliana Seow, the Singaporean chef de mission, to write a formal complaint to the PHISGOC. This was later refuted by the Singapore National Olympic Council. * The Philippine flag was claimed to be used as a table skirt in one of the venues by a retired journalist. The Philippine Sports Commission said they have looked into various venues of the games and concluded that the incident occurred at a different event. Two photos supposedly supporting the claim was posted on Facebook on November 25 with the poster making no reference to the Southeast Asian Games. The following day a former broadcast journalist posted the image with connecting the flag misuse to the games. The images were clarified by the original uploader to have been taken in 2015 with their friends in the United States. * A picture showing the unfinished University of the Philippines Diliman Football Field was erroneously reported as the Biñan Football Stadium. The article was later corrected. * A single cubicle in the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex' restroom was reported to have two toilets.See the following citations: * * It was first uploaded by ABS-CBN reporter Angel Movido on the Twitter. The photo was taken while the restroom was still being renovated. * A viral post from a Facebook page claimed that the Rizal Memorial Stadium would not be part of the venues of the games, insinuating that since there were lapses in renovating the facility, it would not be used for the 2019 SEA Games. Parts of the stadium including a necessary scoreboard did remain unfinished during initial use (see Infrastructure and Logistics above), but the venue was in fact used throughout the Games. * A viral post by the Philippine women's football team coach claimed that they were served kikiam, egg, and rice for breakfast. The hotel later clarified that it was part of a wider buffet and that the kikiam was actually chicken sausage. The hotel claimed in their statement that the coach has apologized to the hotel. *According to PHISGOC chair and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, they were awarded the \\"Best SEA Games Organizer\\" award from Sports Industry Asia (SPIA), a body that PHISGOC had endorsed as one of its sponsors. However, there is no such award and that the PHISGOC was actually awarded with the SPIA Asia Excellence Award. The Philippine News Agency's story on PHISGOC's winning of the award was based on press release sent by the PHISGOC. Judging Malaysian gymnast Izzah Amzan scored identical score (15.200) with gold medalist Koi Sie Yan in the ribbon apparatus event on December 7, but Amzan was awarded a silver medal due to the judges deeming she performed a less difficult routine following tiebreaker rules set by the International Gymnastics Federation. The two gymnast were named joint gold medalists but this was revoked a day later which led to Malaysia filing a protest. The Philippines SEA Games Organising Committee (PHISGOC) has agreed to reinstate the ribbon event gold medal to Malaysian rhythmic gymnast Izzah Amzan after studying the technical regulations for the Games.https://www.nst.com.my/sports/others/2019/12/546736/izzah-gets-back-her- ribbon-gold https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/gymnastics/2019/12/10/m039sia039s-izzah-has- gold-medal-reinstated-in-ribbon-event-in-sea-games https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/12/10/malaysian- gymnast-gets-gold-medal-back-after-protest/  References  Category:2019 controversies Category:2019 Southeast Asian Games Category:Sports controversies Category:Controversies in the Philippines Category:Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte ","title":"Concerns and controversies at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games"},{"id":"62433976","text":"Archana Ramasundaram (born 1 October 1957) also spelt as Archana Ramasundram is a retired Indian police officer who was a member of Tamil Nadu Police.

The World Bank Group, composed of five institutions, works together with the Panamanian government to reduce poverty and increase prosperity. Panama first became a member of the World Bank Group on March 14, 1946. In the past decade, Panama's annual growth has increased by 7.2% in the span of 12 years, making it one of the fastest growing economies in the world. In 2019, Panama was ranked the second fastest growing economy in Latin America by the World Bank. As of 2019, Panama has $435.59 million US dollars being distributed amongst seven projects, all geared toward their overall goal of poverty reduction and indigenous inclusion. Continuing with their efforts to reduce extreme poverty, the World Bank along with efforts of the Panamanian government has reduced poverty from 39.9% to 26.2% while extreme poverty has been reduced by an estimated 15.6% to 11.3% from 2014 to 2019. As of late 2019, there is an estimated $213.26 million US dollars of undisbursed loans.  Strategies as of 2019  The five institutions of the World Bank are the IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID. Currently, Panama has projects with three institutions of the World Bank given they are not eligible for IDA Loans and have no connections with ICSID. They have a total of 66 disclosed projects with IBRD, 20 with IFC and 2 with MIGA. Panama holds 0.07% of all IBRD and IFC votes, 0.04% of IDA votes, and 0.21% of MIGA votes, respectively. Out of these three institutions, IBRD financing have impacted the economy of Panama the most from 2008 to 2019. Working together, these five institutions and the Panamanian government developed the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) of 2015–2021 in 2015 to outline the specific areas needed for improvement and development in the country. As outlined by this plan, there are three specific areas of focus needed for the continued improvement of the country: the support of continued growth, the inclusion and opportunity for growth of marginalized and indigenous communities and supporting resilience and sustainability through the country. Following the goals of the CPF, the Panamanian government ensures the support of growth through the economy with investments in infrastructure and logistics projects. Additionally, the Panamanian government has increased funding for the tourism sector as it has shown to increase economic growth by 0.4% in Latin America countries.

Support for the National Indigenous Peoples Development Plan  The Support for the National Indigenous Peoples Development Plan was first voted on March 15, 2018 as part of Panamas continuous efforts of increased inclusivity and fairness. The original closing date for this plan is set to be June 30, 2023. The project itself is set to cost an estimated $85.20 million US dollars with a commitment of $80.00 million US dollars made by the World Bank. The goal of this plan is to strengthen the capacity of Indigenous authorities to decide on investments of Indigenous land and resources used by the government. Additionally, the plan is set to aid in the delivery of public services to these indigenous communities. As of December 2019, this plan has an \\"Overall Implementation Progress (IP)\\" score of moderately unsatisfactory and a \\"Progress toward Achievement\\" score of moderately satisfactory. The implementation process in the year of 2019 has been delayed mainly due to elections and changes in government in Panama, all which began in February 2019. In response, the Indigenous communities of Panama have expressed their need for urgent implementation and demanded the Panamanian government begin implementation before the end of 2019. Village along Chucunaque River in Panama.  Burunga Wastewater Management Project  In their efforts to strengthen shared prosperity in Panama, the Panamanian government, along with the help of the World Bank, approved the Burunga Wastewater Management Project on March 17, 2017. The projected closing date for this project is set to be December 31, 2021. This project is set to cost roughly $81.20 million US dollars, with a commitment of $65.00 million US dollars made by the World Bank. This project is composed of three specific steps: 1) Construction of new sewerage system in the town of Burunga, Panama. 2) development and strengthening of said sewage system to assist surrounding communities, 3) finance management of project and management costs. Each step costing roughly $49.50 US million dollars, $12.70 US million dollars, and $19.00 US million dollars, respectively. According to the World Bank, this project is set to address the serious health risks that arise from the untreated wastewater in Panama. As of now, many Panamanian citizens living in extreme poverties deposit their sewage waste into rivers in their surrounding areas. This leads to significant increases in water-borne illness amongst indigenous and impoverished communities.  Basic Education Quality Improvement Project  Despite Panamas economic success, the measures of student enrollment, completion and retention differs significantly between urban and indigenous/rural communities. Problems of internal efficiency have been cited as the number one obstacle in Panamas education system, that of which most effects the poor and indigenous. In response, the Panamanian government implemented this project from August 5, 2008 to December 31, 2014. In total, the program cost $42.00 million US dollars, with a commitment amount of $35 million US dollars from the World Bank. The goals of this project were to improve the quality of basic and secondary education programs, increase internal efficiency amongst these programs, and lastly, to enhance the performance and strategic plans of the Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educacion) in Panama.

It was a one-off, first-class cricket tournament that was separate from the County Championship, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The eighteen county cricket teams were split into three groups of six, with the two group winners with the most points advancing to a final held at Lord's. The maximum number of overs bowled in a day was reduced from 96 to 90, and the team's first innings could be no longer than 120 overs. After a delay due to the pandemic, counties passed a majority vote to start the season on 1 August 2020, with the final starting on 23 September 2020. The tournament was named the Bob Willis Trophy in honour of Bob Willis, who died in December 2019. In the final round of matches, the game between Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire was abandoned at lunch on the first day, after a member of the Northamptonshire squad provided a positive test for COVID-19. The match was recorded as a draw, with Northamptonshire taking ten points, and Gloucestershire eight. Neither side were in contention to reach the final of the tournament. Essex became the first team to qualify for the final of the tournament, after they beat Middlesex by nine wickets in their final match, and Derbyshire failed to gain a batting point in their match against Lancashire. Somerset became the second team to qualify for the final after they beat Worcestershire by 60 runs in their fifth match of the tournament. The final finished as a draw, with Essex winning the tournament, after securing a lead in the first innings of the match. In October 2020, Sussex were deducted 24 points after bowler Mitchell Claydon was found guilty of a ball tampering offence. Claydon was adjudged to have applied hand sanitiser to the ball during a game against Middlesex in August. The player also received a nine-game ban. Background The first round of matches in the County Championship were originally scheduled to start on 12 April, with the final round of matches finishing on 25 September. However in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the season would be delayed until at least 28 May 2020. The following month, Abu Dhabi Cricket (ADC) suggested using facilities in the United Arab Emirates between October and January as a possible solution to playing some fixtures. On 24 April 2020, the ECB confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020. As a result of the pandemic, the vast majority of clubs placed players and staff on furlough. In late May 2020, the ECB looked at the idea of starting the County Championship in August, split into three groups of six teams, with a final at Lord's. The ECB also confirmed that no domestic cricket would be played before 1 August 2020. In June 2020, some clubs raised concerns about the logistics of travelling and the financial viability of playing first-class cricket, with 50-over matches being a more realistic possibility. On 29 June 2020, the ECB confirmed that the domestic cricket season would begin on 1 August 2020, with the format to be agreed in early July. On 7 July 2020, the majority of counties voted to start the season on 1 August 2020. On 26 July 2020, a crowd of 1,000 spectators were allowed to watch a test event at The Oval in London, the first time people had been to see a live cricket match since the start of the pandemic. Following the success of the trial, a pilot scheme would have allowed up to 2,500 fans to attend the first two days of play of Surrey and Warwickshire's first matches. However, on 31 July 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced crowds would not be allowed to attend sporting events following an increase in COVID-19 infection rates. Teams The teams were placed into the following groups: * North Group: Derbyshire, Durham, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire * Central Group: Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, Somerset, Warwickshire, Worcestershire * South Group: Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex Fixtures The fixtures for the tournament were announced on 24 July 2020.

If no play was possible on the reserve day, the ECB announced that the matches would have been played on 7 October 2020.

It is situated south of Lightning Lake, north of the Canada–United States border, and north-northeast of Castle Peak, which is its nearest higher peak. Frosty Mountain is the highest peak in E. C. Manning Provincial Park, and is part of the Hozameen Range which is a subrange of the Cascade Range. It has a lower elevation subsidiary peak known as Frosty Mountain East (2409 m) which is labelled as Frosty Mountain on some maps. The Frosty Mountain name was officially adopted on March 31, 1924, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The peak was first climbed on September 2, 1904, by Sledge Tatum and George Loudon Jr., two members of a Boundary Survey group led by Edward C. Barnard. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into headwaters of Frosty Creek, as well as other tributaries of the Similkameen River. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Frosty Mountain is composed of vertically thrusted metasedimentary rock from the ancient Methow Ocean. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

Russia has a national team for international cricket. In 2012, they were officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as an Affiliate member In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Russia and other ICC Members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. History The game was played in St. Petersburg as ahead of schedule as the 1870s. In 1875, the British inhabitants of the city tested the mariners of the Prince of Wales' Royal Yacht Osbourne to a match. The Communist Revolution of 1917 put paid to the spread of cricket in Russia as it was viewed as a round of the \\"middle class\\" and playing it was debilitated. With the British moving out of St. Petersburg following the Revolution, the game rapidly kicked the bucket with them. The Russia national cricket team played their first home representative match against a touring side from North Wales – Carmel & District Cricket Club – at the Moscow State University Baseball Stadium in 2007. There were also sporadic games of cricket played in St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia. Quick forward to 1995 the primary cricket coordinate was played in Russia, where two groups made up of ostracizes took an interest in a coincidental match. Regardless of two or three coincidental matches throughout the following couple of years it wasn't until 1997 when a match was played to praise the autonomy of India and Pakistan, that a look at the possibility to build up cricket in Russia was appeared. In 2004 the United Cricket League was enrolled as a lawful substance, presently renamed Cricket Russia. Cricket Russia is the main enrolled National Governing Body for Cricket in Russia. Cricket in Russia is perceived by the Multisport Association of Russia; this is the relationship for all authority brandishing associations inside Russia which are not yet Olympic perceived games. In 2012 Cricket Russia were allowed enrollment to the ICC. In July 2019, cricket was not included on Russia's list of official sports. It meant that Cricket Russia did not receive government funding over the year. However, in May 2020, the Russian Government reversed its decision, recognising cricket as a sport, and therefore eligible for funding.

It was founded by Kristian Glagau in 1991 and is now managed by his son Nils together with Michael Schmidt. Orthomol specialises in the production of over-the-counter micronutrient combinations. The effect of such supplements is a controversial subject.  History  At the end of the 1980s, concept of using complex combinations of micronutrients, i.e. vitamins and minerals and other substances for the prevention and dietary treatment of illnesses had already established itself in the U.S. In order to bring orthomolecular medicine to Germany and Europe, Kristian Glagau and Hans Dietl founded Orthomol in 1991. The company quickly grew to about 100 employees and became one of the leading providers in the micronutrient segment. Alongside its activities in the German market, the company expanded internationally, not only in Europe, but also in Russia and the United States, as well as the Middle East and Asia. In 2009, the founder and Managing Director of Orthomol, Kristian Glagau, passed away. The company remained in family hands and was managed by Glagau's two children together with Michael Schmidt, who had already worked as Managing Director before Glagau's death. Although most aspects of the Orthomol business strategy remained unchanged, the product range was expanded.  Group structure  Orthomol's parent company is Orthomol Holding, a limited liability company according to German law (GmbH). It is currently managed by Nils Glagau (Sales and Marketing) and Michael Schmidt (Purchasing, Production, Logistics and Technology). The ownership structure of the group consists of two separate families, those of the founders Nils Glagau and Gesche Hugger.  Criticism  There are several doubts concerning the effectiveness of the products produced by Orthomol and other manufacturers, which is yet to be sufficiently identified in scientific terms based on evidence-based medicine criteria. The non-academic German press has also commented negatively on the products.

History The newspaper was first published on 8 April 1933 by journalist Saeroen. In the first few months after the first issue, the sales of the newspaper could not cover expenditures, and the newspaper received financial support from local plantation owner Oene Djoenaidi. Saeroen would write editorials in Pemandangan under the pen name \\"Kampret\\" (bat), but these editorials resulted in Pemandangan being censored by the Dutch East Indies government. It also ceased publication for a week between 17 and 24 May 1940, due to censorship. Pemandangan would continue to publish following the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, and was the only newspaper to continue publication during the early occupation period without any shutdowns. During the occupation period, it was the chief competitor of the Japanese-sponsored newspaper Asia Raya. Pemandangan had a stance of being neutral with respect to political parties, though it maintained a nationalist stance. Around that time, the paper had a daily circulation of 7,000. The paper was censored at least twice during the occupation - in both cases due to images of Japanese Emperor Hirohito being obscured by the Japanese flag and both resulting in the arrest of editor-in- chief Soemanang Soerjowinoto. In the aftermath of the Pacific War and during the Indonesian National Revolution, Djoenaidi enlisted journalist Rosihan Anwar to use Pemandangan's existing printing facilities to publish another newspaper, Pedoman. In 1953, Pemandangan was accused of leaking national secrets - specifically, on new civil servant salaries and foreign investments to 21 firms \\\\- in a column, and its editor-in-chief Asa Bafaqih was put on trial. Bafaqih accepted full responsibility, while refusing to reveal the names of informants in accordance with the journalistic code. The investigation was eventually ceased by the Attorney General at that time, Soeprapto. It ceased publication in 1958.

At his office, the employees tell them that Dileep is abroad and the two friends decide to stay in Kerala until his return. Karan then comes across Prarthana (Sangeetha) on multiple occasions and they eventually fall in love with each other. Upon his return, Karan meets Dileep and Dileep refuses to help him. Karan comes to know that Prarthana is none other than Dileep's sister. Dileep proposes Karan a deal: either Karan marries his sister without any dowry or Karan takes a huge sum to let go of his sister. Karan surprisingly accepts the money thus breaking the heart of Prarthana. In a flashback, Karan lived with his mentor Vishwanathan (Poornam Vishwanathan) and his daughter Thulasi (Rajashree). At Thulasi's engagement, the groom's family asked for a huge sum of money and Vishwanathan reluctantly accepted. Vishwanathan planned to withdraw a property case in Kerala and to take the money so he requested Karan to go to Kerala and to solve the issue. Back to the present, Karan returns to Chennai with the money to pay the dowry. The day of the wedding, the groom's family ask for more money and the wedding is eventually cancelled. The circumstances force Karan to marry Thulasi on the spot and Vishwanathan died of a heart attack that day. Thereafter, Karan becomes a wealthy businessman while Prarthana is diagnosed with depression and has lost all her memory. To cure his sister, Dileep begs Karan to come to the hospital and a remorseful Karan secretly meets her at the hospital.

History The Club was formed on October 15, 1879, occupying the former parade grounds of the nearby Citadel of Cascais, and became known as the ‘Parade’. Enjoying patronage by King Luis and King Carlos, it was a very elite club, patronised by those who wanted to be and could afford to be close to the Royal Family, which, by 1879, was spending part of its annual summer holidays in the town. On December 31, 1904, the club's General Assembly unanimously approved its conversion into a Limited Liability Company. In June 1910 it was renamed as the Royal Sporting Club of Cascais, although “Royal” was soon rapidly removed following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic in October 1910. The club closed down in 1974. Its documentation is retained in the Cascais Municipal Archives, held at the nearby Casa Sommer. After closure the building first housed a nursery and a nursery school. In 1978 it was designated as the site for a new Museum of the Sea, which was opened in 1992. Members All early members were from “well- known families” and access by other social classes was virtually impossible. This would only change with the establishment of the Republic and, even so, only slowly. Members included foreign ambassadors who felt it necessary to be close to the King when he was absent from Lisbon, as well as politicians such as Fontes Pereira de Melo, Henrique de Barros Gomes, António de Serpa Pimentel, José Dias Ferreira and Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. The military was represented by Hermenegildo Capelo and Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, while writers included Camilo Castelo Branco and Edgar Prestage, Britain's leading authority on Portuguese history and literature. Among businessmen and bankers were Jorge O’Neill. The photographer, Joshua Benoliel, was also a member. King Carlos at the Cascais Sporting Club Sporting activities The club organised tennis games, archery, and pigeon shooting, as well as charity parties. Its importance was noted by the writer Ramalho Ortigão who in October 1888 wrote that “The Sporting Club [...] has given [Cascais] an air of civilization . . . . . . . . . Several garden games have been properly established and are regularly attended.” The club played a leading role in popularising both tennis and football (soccer) in Portugal. This was mainly due to one of its members, Guilherme Pinto Basto, known as the father of Portuguese tennis, who acted as the tennis coach, introducing the game to club members, including Prince Carlos, from around 1882. International tennis tournaments were organised from 1902, with guests including the six- time Wimbledon Ladies singles winner, Blanche Bingley. These became the International Championships of Portugal, and were held at the Cascais club from 1902 to 1973. Participants included the British player, Noel Turnbull, who had won a gold medal at the 1920 Olympic Games and the Spaniard Manuel Alonso Areizaga. A memorial to the first football (soccer) match played on mainland Portugal in Cascais in October 1888 The first recorded football game in Portugal was in Madeira in 1875. Guilherme Pinto Basto and the Cascais Club organised the first game on the Portuguese mainland thirteen years later. This was played as an exhibition on the former parade grounds in October 1888. Those taking part included four members of the Pinto Basto family, including Guilherme. His brothers, Eduardo and Frederico, brought the ball back from England, where they were studying. A plaque now records the event.

Life and work  Born in Vienna, Weidmann was the son of the actor and writer Joseph Weidmann (1742-1810) and nephew of the playwright Paul Weidmann (1746–1810). Since he wasn't particularly talented as an actor, he voluntarily ended his father's initiated engagement at the Wiener Hoftheater and got a small pension for it till the end of his life. As a freelance writer he gained some recognition because of his modest, unobtrusive manner, among others by his Sämmtliche Werke; published from 1821 to 1822, the first volume with four historical dramas, the second with poetry, and the third with the Memorabilien aus meiner Reisetasche. Thanks to the support of Archduke Johann, from this third volume onwards he wrote in particular descriptions of the surroundings of Vienna and the Austrian Alpine landscapes, Dalmatia and Montenegro with a mixture of topographical information and his own inventions. However, his good friend Adolf Bäuerle, in whose Wiener Theaterzeitung he wrote some theatre reviews, noted that Weidmann never got out of the Österreichischen Erblanden, so that many of his travelogues would have originated only from fantasy, namely the announced descriptions of Egypt and Syria.Frankfurter Conversationsblatt of November 1844 Bäuerle brought this to the point: : He's travelled the world in the seven-league boots of lies. When he talks about his travels and goes beyond Austria and Styria, no Sylbe can be believed. He was more successful as a Viennese chronicler, reporter, obituarist, and theatre and art critic who worked for decades. As a journalistic \\"girl Friday\\", his contemporary nickname, he published the Oesterreichischer Zuschauer in 1854 after the death of Josef Sigmund Ebersberg, even if only for a short time. Mainly he wrote reviews for the aforementioned Wiener Theaterzeitung, 's ' and other magazines. As a reviewer he was prolific. He wrote about theatre and opera performances, painting, sculpture, fashion, and industrial architecture. Nevertheless, there was no financial success for the rest of his life, so he had to live off his small pension as an actor. At an advanced age he claimed to have been born six to seven years earlier and therefore older. His funeral expenses were paid by an unknown high-ranking personality at his written request. Weidmann was a member of the famous Viennese artist society \\"Die Ritter von der grünen Insel\\" (The Knights of the Green Island), to which the composer Franz von Suppé, the painter Eduard Swoboda and the Burgtheater actor Konrad Adolf Hallenstein belonged, under the direction of the playwright Otto Prechtler, along with many other artists.Franz Wallner: Die grüne Insel in Wien  Plays  * Sieg, Freiheit und Friede.

He was from a strong United Presbyterian background and specialised in churches for the United Presbyterian Church and Free Church of Scotland. Many of his buildings are listed buildings,.http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB20461 Life He was born in New Pitsligo in 1844 the son of John Wilson, a master builder, and his wife, Eliza Gordon. He was articled (apprenticed) to Alexander Ellis (1830-1917), an architect-builder, in Aberdeen in 1859. Around 1866 he was placed in the office of Alexander Thomson (1817-1875), a well-known architect, later nicknamed \\"Greek Thomson\\". Thomson's style is evidenced in Wilson's work. In 1869 he returned to Ellis as a junior partner, with offices at 13 Belmont Street in Aberdeen.Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1870 Ellis retired in 1896 leaving Wilson as sole partner until 1906 when he was joined by his namesake son (1877-1939). He retired in 1915 leaving his son in charge. Wilson served on Aberdeen Town Council 1914 to 1924. He was Chairman of the Plans Committee (overseeing Planning and Building Control matters). He was Chairman of the Rubislaw Granite Company, Chairman of Kilgour and Walker, and Director of Richards. His unpaid roles included Chairman of the Aberdeen Royal Asylum and the Aberdeen University Press. He was a Trustee of the Aberdeen Savings Bank.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200929 He died on 28 July 1931.

Given a set of items with different values, the 1-out-of-n maximin-share is the maximum value that can be gained by partitioning the items into n parts and taking the part with the minimum value. An allocation of items among n agents with different valuations is called MMS-fair if each agent gets a bundle that is at least as good as his/her 1-out-of-n maximin-share. MMS fairness was invented by Eric Budish as a relaxation of the criterion of proportionality - each agent gets a bundle that is at least as good as the equal split (1/n of every resource). Proportionality can be guaranteed when the items are divisible, but not when they are indivisible, even if all agents have identical valuations. In contrast, MMS fairness can always be guaranteed to identical agents, so it is a natural alternative to proportionality even when the agents are different.  Motivation and examples  Identical items. Suppose first that m identical items have to be allocated fairly among n people. Ideally, each person should receive m/n items, but this may be impossible if m is not divisible by n, as the items are indivisible. A natural second-best fairness criterion is to round m/n down to the nearest integer, and give each person at least floor(m/n) items. Receiving less than floor(m/n) items is \\"too unfair\\" - it is an unfairness not justified by the indivisibility of the items. Different items. Suppose now that the items are different, and each item has a different value. Now, rounding down to the nearest integer may not be the right solution. For example, suppose n=3 and m=5 and the items' values are 1, 3, 5, 6, 9. The sum of values is 24, and it is divisible by 3, so ideally we would like to give each person a value of at least 8, but this is not possible. The largest value that can be guaranteed to all three agents is 7, by the partition {1,6},{3,5},{9}. Informally, 7 is the total value divided by n \\"rounded down to the nearest item\\". The set {1,6} attaining this maximin value is called the \\"1-out-of-3 maximin-share\\" - it is the best subset of items that can be constructed by partitioning the original set into 3 parts and taking the least valuable part. Therefore, in this example, an allocation is MMS-fair iff it gives each agent a value of at least 7. Different valuations. Suppose now that each agent assigns a different value to each item, for example: * Alice values them at 1,3,5,6,9; * George values them at 1,7,2,6,8; * Dina values them at 1,1,1,4,17. Now, each agent has a different MMS: * Alice's MMS is still {1,6} as above; * George's MMS is {1,7} or {2,6} or {8}, by the partition {1,7},{2,6},{8} (all these bundles are equivalent for him); * Dina's MMS is {1,1,1}, by the partition {1,1,1},{4},{17}. Here, an allocation is MMS- fair if it gives Alice a value of at least 7, George a value of at least 8, and Dina a value of at least 3. For example, the in which George gets the first two items {1,7}, Alice gets the next two items {5,6}, and Dina gets the last item {17} is MMS-fair. Interpretation. The 1-out-of-n MMS of an agent can be interpreted as the maximal utility that an agent can hope to get from an allocation if all the other agents have the same preferences, when he always receives the worst share. It is the minimal utility that an agent could feel entitled to, based on the following argument: if all the other agents have the same preferences as me, there is at least one allocation that gives me this utility, and makes every other agent (weakly) better off; hence there is no reason to give me less. An alternative interpretation is: the most preferred bundle the agent could guarantee as divider in divide and choose against adversarial opponents: the agent proposes her best allocation and leaves all the other ones to choose one share before taking the remaining one. MMS- fairness can also be described as the result of the following negotiation process. A certain allocation is suggested. Each agent can object to it by suggesting an alternative partition of the items. However, in doing so he must let all other agents chose their share before he does. Hence, an agent would object to an allocation only if he can suggest a partition in which all bundles are better than his current bundle. An allocation is MMS-fair iff no agent objects to it, i.e., for every agent, in every partition there exists a bundle which is weakly worse than his current share.  Existence of MMS-fair allocations  When all n agents have identical valuations, an MMS-fair allocation always exists by definition. Even when only n-1 agents have identical valuations, an MMS-fair allocation still exists and can be found by divide and choose: the n-1 identical agents partition the items into n bundles each of which is at least as good as the MMS; the n-th agent chooses a bundle with a highest value; and the identical agents take the remaining n-1 bundles. In particular, with two agents, an MMS-fair allocation always exists. Bouveret and Lemaître performed extensive randomized simulations for more than 2 agents, and found that MMS-fair allocations exist in every trial. They proved that MMS allocations exist in the following cases: * Binary valuations - each agent either likes an item (values it at 1) or dislikes it (values it at 0). * Identical multisets - agents may value the items differently, but the multisets of the agents' values are the same. * Few items - m ≤ n+3. Procaccia and WangProcaccia AD, Wang J (2014). Fair enough: guaranteeing approximate maximin shares. EC '14 Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation. pp. 675–692. . . and Kurokawahttp://procaccia.info/papers/mms.jacm.pdf constructed an example with n=3 agents and m=12 items, in which no allocation guarantees to each agent the 1-out-of-3 MMS. Moreover, they showed that for every n ≥ 3 there is such an example with 3n+4 items.  Multiplicative approximation  Following the non- existence result for MMS allocations, Procaccia and Wang introduced the multiplicative approximation to MMS: an allocation is r-fraction MMS, for some fraction r in [0,1], if each agent's value is at least a fraction r of the value of his/her MMS. They presented an algorithm that always finds an rn- fraction MMS, where r_n := \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot \\\\text{oddfloor}(n)}{3\\\\cdot \\\\text{oddfloor}(n) -1}, where oddfloor(n) is the largest odd integer smaller or equal to n. In particular, r3 = r4 = 3/4, it decreases when n increases, and it always larger than 2/3. Their algorithm runs in time polynomial in m, when n is constant. Amanatidis, Markakis, Nikzad and Saberi proved that, in randomly-generated instances, MMS-fair allocations exist with high probability. They presented several improved algorithms: * A simple and fast 1/2-fraction MMS algorithm; *A 2/3-fraction MMS algorithm that runs in polynomial time in both m and n; * A 7/8-fraction MMS algorithm for 3 agents; * An MMS-fair algorithm for the case of ternary valuations - each value is 0 or 1 or 2. Barman and Krishnamurthy presented: * A simple and efficient algorithm for 2/3-fraction MMS with additive valuations - based on the envy- cycles procedure. * A simple algorithm for 1/10-fraction MMS for the more challenging case of submodular valuations - based on round-robin item allocation. Ghodsi, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Seddighin and Yami presented: * For additive valuations: a polynomial-time algorithm for 3/4-fraction MMS. *For n=4 additive agents: an algorithm for 4/5-fraction MMS. * For submodular valuations: a polynomial-time algorithm for 1/3-fraction MMS, and an upper bound of 3/4-fraction. * For XOS valuations: a polynomial-time algorithm for 1/8-fraction MMS, an existence proof for 1/5-fraction, and an upper bound of 1/2-fraction. * For subadditive valuations: an existence proof for log(m)/10-fraction MMS, and an upper bound of 1/2-fraction. Garg, McGlaughlin and Taki presented a simple algorithm for 2/3-fraction MMS whose analysis is also simple. To date, it is not known what is the largest r such that an r-fraction MMS allocation always exists. It can be any number between 3/4 and slightly less than 1. Amanatidis, Birmpas and Markakis presented truthful mechanisms for approximate MMS-fair allocations (see also Strategic fair division): * For n agents: an 1/O(m)-fraction MMS. * For 2 agents: a 1/2-fraction MMS, and a proof that no truthful mechanism can attain more than 1/2. Xin and Pinyan study MMS-fair allocation of chores (items with negative values) and show that a 9/11-fraction MMS allocation always exists.  Ordinal approximation  Budish introduced a different approximation to the 1-of-n MMS—the 1-of-(n+1) MMS (each agent receives at least as much as he could get by partitioning into n+1 bundles and getting the worst one). He showed that the Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes always guarantees the 1-of-(n+1) MMS, However, this allocation may have excess supply, and - more importantly - excess demand: the sum of the bundles allocated to all agents might be slightly larger than the set of all items. Such an error is reasonable when allocating course seats among students, since a small excess supply can be corrected by adding a small number of seats. But the classic fair division problem assumes that items may not be added. For any number of agents with additive valuations, any envy-free-except-1 (EF1) allocation gives each agent at least the 1-out-of-(2n-1) MMS. EF1 allocations can be found, for example, by round-robin item allocation or by the envy-cycles procedure. Moreover, a 1-out-of-(2n-2) MMS allocation can be found using envy-free matching. To date, it is not known what is the smallest N such that a 1-out- of-N MMS allocation always exists. It can be any number between n+1 and 2n-2. The smallest open case is n=4. The ordinal MMS condition can also be applied to asymmetric agents (agents with different entitlements).  Other algorithmic problems  Several basic algorithms related to the MMS are: * Calculating the MMS of a given agent. It is NP-hard even for agents with additive valuations: it can be reduced from the partition problem. Woeginger developed a PTAS for it. * Deciding whether a given allocation is 1-of-n MMS is co-NP complete for agents with additive valuations. * Deciding whether a given instance admits any MMS allocation is in NP^{NP}, i.e., it can be solved in nondeterministic-polynomial time using an oracle to an NP problem (the oracle is needed to calculate the MMS of an agent). However, the exact computational complexity of this problem is still unknown: it may be level 2 or 1 or even 0 of the polynomial hierarchy.  MMS fairness for groups  An allocation is called pairwise-maximin-share-fair (PMMS-fair) if, for every two agents i and j, agent i receives at least his 1-out-of-2 maximin-share restricted to the items received by i and j. An allocation is called groupwise-maximin-share-fair (GMMS-fair) if, for every subgroup of agents of size k, each member of the subgroup receives his/her 1-out-of-k maximin-share restricted to the items received by this subgroup. With additive valuations, the various fairness notions are related as follows: * Envy-freeness implies GMMS-fairness; * GMMS-fairness implies MMS-fairness (by taking the subgroup of size n) and PMMS-fairness (by taking subgroups of size 2); * PMMS-fairness implies 1/2-MMS-fairness; * PMMS-fairness implies EFX, which implies EF1. * MMS-fairness and PMMS-fairness do not imply each other.

Her paintings are in museum collections including San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), the Oakland Museum of California, Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, National Gallery of Art, and the Berkeley Art Museum.  Life  June Felter was born in Oakland, California in 1919. Her parents died when she was very young, and she grew up in the Tom and Grace Scanlon family. June studied at the Oakland Art Institute, the California College of Arts and Crafts, and the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1943 she married Richard Henry Felter and had two children, Susan and Tom. The couple stayed together until Richard’s death in 2000. June was a commercial illustrator before and during World War II, but transitioned to painting in the 1950s. At that time she studied with Richard Diebenkorn, and became a colleague of Elmer Bischoff and Wayne Thiebaud. She taught art to children and figurative drawing to adults at SFMOMA. Felter’s home and studio with hundreds of paintings and drawings was destroyed by the 1991 Oakland Firestorm. She died at home on 13 July 2019 at the age of 99.  Art  Felter was influenced by artists of the Bay Area figurative movement, especially Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff, and David Park. Her paintings and prints represent her everyday life; figures and still-lifes are the subject matter. A class at the San Francisco Art Institute taught by Richard Diebenkorn in 1960 furthered Felter’s practice of figurative style. In her landscapes, nudes and complex still-lifes, June’s work was appreciated for its graceful spontaneity. In 1997 she became a part of Crown Point’s published “Live Model Group” portfolio which included work by Nathan Oliveira, Enrique Chagoya, and Fred Dalkey. Felter remarked that drawing a nude model not only shows an interest in ourselves as human beings, but also seems to be a necessary exercise for keeping flexible, sensitive, and open to surprise. She participated in etching workshops held in Kathan Brown’s basement and her etchings are featured in his book “Why Draw a Live Model?” Felter created a series of paintings on the Oakland hills fire of 1991. She painted her impression as a witness of the disastrous 1991 fire in the Oakland Hills using the expressive quality of gestural brushwork, she conveyed the dramatic effects of wind, fire and some in a vivid depiction of the catastrophic event. Felter collaborated with Barbara Guest whose books Musicality, 1988 and The Confetti Trees, 1999 feature Felter’s art. Felter’s drawings also illustrate The Middle Ages poem by Rella Lossy in her book Time Pieces: A Collection of Poetry, 1944-1996. Felter’s artworks are also included in a booklet of Wiegand Gallery Art of June Felter, Adelie Landis, Louise Smith, 1992. June Felter’s work has been offered at auction multiple times, with the record price $6,795 USD for Portrait of Gay Buchanan sold at Bonhams New Bond Street in 2012. Her latest exhibition featuring works spanning 60 years of a life in art “June Felter: Her Life & Art” was presented at 871 Fine Arts from October 2nd to October 19th 2019.

Released biennially, the World Migration Report 2020 is the tenth edition in the series. History The World Migration Report was first published by IOM in 2000 with the aim of promoting 'a better understanding of the main migratory movements that are occurring across the globe'. The first edition sought to achieve this aim by providing ‘an authoritative account of contemporary trends, issues, and problems in the field of international migration’, presenting together a ‘review of trends in international migration in each major region of the world’ with ‘a discussion of some of the main migration policy issues facing the international community’. The subsequent seven editions, published between 2003 and 2015, were published with specific thematic interests. The 2018 edition of the World Migration Report, the first published by IOM as the United Nation’s Migration Agency, restructured the report into two parts. The first part provides ’key information on migration and migrants\\" through an exploration of the statistical data available on migration. The second part features several chapters that each feature a 'balanced, evidence-based analysis of complex and emerging migration issues.'  Editions   World Migration Report 2020  The World Migration Report 2020, the tenth in the series, retains the same structure as its predecessor, and similarly has the aim of contributing to increased understanding of migration throughout the world. The first four chapters are the same as in the 2018 edition, which provide updated migration statistics at the global and regional levels, while the second part considers different migration issues to those in the previous report: * Migrants’ contributions to societies; * Migration, inclusion and social cohesion; * Migration and health; * Children and unsafe migration; * Migration and adaptation to environmental change; * Migrants caught in crises; and * Recent developments in global migration governance.  World Migration Report 2018  Unlike the seven preceding reports which centred around a specific theme, the World Migration Report 2018 seeks to provide ‘both overview information that helps to explain migration patterns and processes, as well as insights and recommendations on major issues that policymakers are or will soon be grappling with.’ The first part of the report consists of four chapters produced institutionally by IOM. It draws primarily upon analyses by IOM experts, practitioners and officials around the world, and compiles a wealth of data, information, and analysis with the aim of increasing the understanding of migration at both the global and regional levels. Conversely, the second part is authored by applied and academic researchers working on migration and mobility, and presents balanced, evidence-based analyses of complex and emerging migration issues. Specifically, the second section comprises the following chapters: * Global migration governance frameworks: Existing architecture and recent developments; * Mobility, migration and transnational connectivity; * Understanding migration journeys from migrants’ perspectives; * Media reporting of migrants and migration; * Migration, violent extremism and social exclusion; and * Migrants and cities: Stepping beyond World Migration Report 2015.  Thematic editions  The seven editions of the World Migration Report released between 2003 and 2015 are organised around a core theme: * World Migration Report 2015: Migrants and Cities, New Partnerships to Manage Mobility. * World Migration Report 2013: High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. * World Migration Report 2011: Communicating Effectively about Migration. * World Migration Report 2010: The Future of Migration: Building Capacities for Change. * World Migration Report 2008: Managing Labour Mobility in the Evolving Global Economy. * World Migration Report 2005: Costs and Benefits of International Migration. * World Migration Report 2003: Challenges and Responses for People on the Move.  World Migration Report 2000  Like the most recent editions of the World Migration Report, the 2000 edition is divided into two parts. The first examines the scale of migration and characteristics of international migrants, including: the types of movements underway; the factors which contribute to migration; and the policy issues associated with these trends. In nine separate chapters, the second part reviews migration trends and recent policy developments in the major migration regions of the world. Alongside this discussion is an analysis of the integration of migrants, the consequences of irregular migration, and the extent of interregional cooperation between states.  Uses of the report   World Migration Report 2020  Media outlets such as CNN Español, the World Economic Forum and Reuters have published articles that utilize the World Migration Report 2020 as a resource to discuss contemporary migration trends.CNN Español. 2019-12-18. \\"Una de cada 30 personas es inmigrante: 6 gráficas para este Día Internacional del Migrante.\\" https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2019/12/18/una-de-cada-30-personas-es- inmigrante-6-graficas-para-este-dia-internacional-del-migrante/  World Migration Report 2018  The World Migration Report 2018 has been referenced in a wide range of peer-reviewed research outputs. The report has featured in articles released in the academic journal The Lancet on five occasions, as well as books released by Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press. It has also been attributed as a source in reports produced by the Finnish government and Save the Children,Save the Children: Síntesis Temática Sobre Estudios de la Niñez y Adolescencia en Situación de Movilidad para la Región de América Latina. http://pasc-lac.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/02/Sinte.pdf The SAGE Handbook of International Migration, the United Nation’s 2018 World Happiness Report and an Oxford Research Encyclopedia focusing on migrants and refugees in Africa. In their guide “Immigration Data Matters”, the Migration Policy Institute recommended the report as a source of “current and historical estimates of international migrants by destination and/or origin”. The 2018 Report was employed as a fact-checking resource against xenophobic claims on social media. World Migration Report 2020 The World Migration Report 2020 is the tenth edition of the International Organization for Migration’s flagship World Migration Report publication series. Released on 27 November 2019 at the 110th Session of the IOM Council, the report follows the same structure as the 2018 edition and seeks “to contribute to increased understanding of migration throughout the world.”\\"Launch of the World Migration Report 2020.\\" IOM. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSalb1x5jKE  Chapters of the report  The World Migration Report 2020 has 11 chapters, the first of which presents a number of highlights from the report and outlines the report’s structure. The other 10 chapters aim to inform current and future policy deliberations and discussions by providing a clear identification of the key issues, a critical overview of relevant research and analysis, and a discussion of the implications for future research and policymaking. Chapter 2 draws upon global sources of data to provide an overview of key figures and trends regarding the stocks and flows of international migrants, as well as remittances. After an initial review of overall migrant stocks and flows, the chapter looks at these trends for specific migrant groups, including migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, and stateless persons. Chapter 3 focuses on key regional dimensions of, and developments in, migration in six world regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America, and Oceania. An overview and brief discussion of key population- related statistics, and a description of “key features and developments” in migration, is provided for each of these regions. Recognizing that the ever- growing nature of migration research has made it difficult to determine which outputs are important and what should be given weight, Chapter 4 provides guidance to those seeking broad guidance on the subject. It conducts a comprehensive review of the migration research and analysis produced by actors, including individuals, academics, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and think tanks. The fifth chapter aims to counter the fact “it is becoming increasingly difficult to hear balance perspectives in public debates on important policy issues, such as international migration” by “reflecting on the contributions that migrants have made, both to their communities of origin and destination.” It focuses on three types of contribution: sociocultural, civic-political, and economic. Chapter 6 focuses on migrants’ social cohesion in destination countries, looking at how they adapt to new cultures, customs, social values, and language. It takes a local perspective, discussing the important role played by local actors and migrants themselves, and as well as the importance of policy settings that are directly and indirectly related to inclusion. An overview of the key issues related to health and migration is discussed in Chapter 7. It recognizes that while migration can lead to a greater exposure to health risks, it can also lead to improved health. The relationship between migration and the health of the wider population is also considered, as are healthcare systems’ responses and the global governance of migration and health. The focus of Chapter 8 is unsafe child migration, where migrant children do not accompany or follow the family in a safe environment. The different types and key drivers of child migration are reviewed, before a discussion of the main issues in confronting child migrants. As extreme weather events and large-scale changes in infrastructure continue to occur, Chapter 9 looks at the ever-increasing role that environmental and climate change plays in decisions to migrate. After an exploration of the different perspectives on the issue, examples of environmental migration from a range of ecological zones – including mountainous, dryland and coastal areas, as well as cities – are provided. While anybody may be affected by a crisis – including disasters, conflicts and political and economic crises – migrants are often among the most vulnerable and may require additional support. Chapter 10 therefore looks at the experiences of migrants in crisis contexts, and at the effectiveness of local, national, and international in meeting the different needs of migrants. The eleventh and final chapter gives an update on the migration governance in the World Migration Report 2018, documenting the key developments in migration governance in the two years since the last report.  Critical reception  Upon release, the 2020 World Migration Report received widespread praise. At the launch of the report, several IOM member states made positive statements. The Canadian government welcomed the publication of “such a valuable tool and reference” and noted that “the report is used by policymakers worldwide, including at all levels of the Canadian government, academia, and civil society”. The El Salvadorian government said that the World Migration Report demonstrates how data can be used to help understand “the basis characteristics of migration in these uncertain times.” The World Migration Report’s ability to counter misinformation and fake news was recognized by German ambassador, Michael von Ungern-Sternberg, who said he believed that it would contribute to a constructive discussion of migration and lay the ground for much needed international cooperation. The report was also well-received by newspapers, think tanks and academics. An editorial in the Africa Times said that the report delivered a “comprehensive assessment of migration drivers for Africa and the wider international community”, while Professor Leticia Florez Estrada, Professor of Sociology at Universidad Europa, noted how the report contained exhaustive and interesting research about migrants, refugees, minors, climate as a driver of migration, and fake news. Jacqueline Bhabha, Professor at Harvard University, commented on the World Migration Report’s encyclopedic nature, noting how several chapters were “perfect for introducing her students to new topics”, adding that they were “well-written and nicely researched”. Population Europe, the network of Europe’s leading demographic research centres, called the report a must-read for those “interested in migration statistics and trends”. Similar praise was given by Sam Grout Smith, of the UK Mission to the United Nations, who felt that the report contained “fascinating data and analysis on migration trends and good sections on tech and climate”.  Collaboration  The report is a highly collaborative venture, drawing on expertise of IOM staff specialising in migration programme delivery, policy development and migration research and analysis, as well as leading migration researchers from around the world.

It is deployed on premise and connects to devices and services from different vendors. As of 2019, close to 300 bindings are available as OSGi modules. Actions, such as switching on lights, are triggered by rules, voice commands, or controls on the openHAB user interface. The openHAB project started in 2010. In 2013, the core functionality became an official project of the Eclipse Foundation under the name Eclipse SmartHome. openHAB is based on Eclipse SmartHome and remains the project for the development of bindings. According to Black Duck Open Hub, it is developed by one of the largest open-source teams in the world. It also has an active user community.  Features   Installation and runtime  openHAB requires a JVM and can be deployed on servers running various operating systems, a dedicated Raspberry Pi instance, or some network-attached storage systems. The required bindings can be added at runtime via OSGi. openHAB supports a number of persistence backends for storing and querying the smart home data, including relational and time series databases.  Discovery and configuration  After installation, openHAB scans the local network and discovers devices that can be included in the smart home solution. Users can provide credentials and meaningful device names via an administration user interface.  Sitemaps  Sitemaps allow the user to determine how the devices in the smart home are arranged. A sitemap groups devices by floor and room and determines how they are visualized and controlled. The following example illustrates what a typical sitemap definition might look like: sitemap demo label=\\"My home automation\\" { Frame label=\\"Date\\" { Text item=Date } Frame label=\\"Demo\\" { Switch item=Lights icon=\\"light\\" Text item=LR_Temperature label=\\"Livingroom [%.1f °C]\\" Group item=Heating Text item=LR_Multimedia_Summary label=\\"Multimedia [%s]\\" icon=\\"video\\" { Selection item=LR_TV_Channel mappings=[0=\\"off\\", 1=\\"DasErste\\", 2=\\"BBC One\\", 3=\\"Cartoon Network\\"] Slider item=LR_TV_Volume } } }  User Interface  Once the system is configured, openHAB users can view data and perform actions using a number of user interfaces. These include a browser based interface as well as apps for Android, Windows 10, and iOS. All of these UIs are defined by the sitemap mechanism. A screenshot of the browser based UI can be seen on this screenshot.  Rules  An event, condition, action rule-based system is used to automate the smart home. The following example turns off a light once the sun rises at the configured location. rule \\"Start wake up light on sunrise\\" when Channel \\"astro:sun:home:rise#event\\" triggered then switch(receivedEvent.getEvent()) { case \\"START\\": { Light.sendCommand(OFF) } } end  openHAB Cloud  openHAB Cloud is a companion cloud service and backend for openHAB. It provides secure remote access and enables openHAB users to remotely monitor, control and steer their homes through the internet.

Stanback inherited a large fortune from his family's headache powder business. Stanback has donated large sums of money to environmental groups but has also funded anti-immigration groups because of his concerns about over-population. He was born in and resides in North Carolina. Wealth Stanback was heir to a substantial interest in the Stanback Company, famous for its headache powders. Stanback served as treasurer and chairman of the board before his 25% share in the company was purchased by William Stanback, Jr. Stanback resigned from these positions but continued on with the company to manage its pension fund. Stanback was a classmate of Warren Buffett at Columbia Business School. He later served as best man at Buffett's wedding. Stanback was part of the second wave of the \\"Buffett Bunch,\\" early investors with Buffett who generally made extremely high returns. Stanback placed $125,000 under Buffett's management in 1962. Stanback partnered with Buffett and other investors to buy the Washington Monthly. Environmentalism and anti-immigration activism Stanback is described as being an \\"anti-humanist\\" environmentalist. Stanback gives to the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council on a regular basis. He also offers substantial support to regional environmental groups such as the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Stanback donated to support environmental programs at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Catawba College, and an internship program at his alma mater, Duke University. Duke removed four anti- immigrant groups from the internship program supported by Stanback after their inclusion became a public controversy. The program was established in 1995 at the behest of Stanback at Duke's Nicholas School for the Environment. Stanback approves all the organizations personally. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA, and Progressives for Immigration Reform were the programs that Duke removed. Stanback said he had met with the leaders of these groups and did not detect any hint of racism about them. Stanback has donated at least hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, founded by John Tanton. Stanback gave $100,000 to Americans for Better Immigration (ABI). ABI was founded by Roy Beck, a close associate of John Tanton. Stanback provided Beck with $32,000 for an anti-immigration video project. Stanback has donated to English Language Advocates, a group that supports making English the official language of the United States. Stanback gave the American Immigration Control Foundation $5,000 to buy and disseminate the book The Camp of the Saints, which has become a canonical text, along with the neo-Nazi book The Turner Diaries, among white supremacists and other racists. It was written in 1973 by the French monarchist and travel writer Jean Raspail and shows how third-world immigration supposedly would destroy western civilization. Foundation for the Carolinas Much of Stanback's philanthropy is managed by the Foundation for the Carolinas, a donor-advised fund. The foundation has been criticized for its ties to Stanback. During 2014, Stanback donated Berkshire Hathaway shares worth about $400 million to the foundation. Frank Sharry, executive director of pro-immigration America's Voice, wrote in a letter to the Foundation for the Carolinas, \\"Mr. Stanback has a long history of supporting groups and individuals who believe that immigrants are inherently inferior and that drastic steps are needed to control global population growth.” Funding against the renewable wood bioenergy industry Stanback has donated at least $300 million to a range of groups campaigning against the renewable wood bioenergy industry on the premise that it facilitates global warming. These groups include the Natural Resources Defense Council, 350.org, the Partnership for Policy Integrity, the Southern Environmental Law Center, and the Dogwood Alliance. The Southern Environmental Law Center received $175 million. The National Resources Defense Council received $81 million. 350.org received $4 million in 2018. Litigation against Smithfield Foods In early 2020, Stanback was criticized for allegedly funding litigation against Smithfield Foods by the head of the National Pork Council, Andy Curliss. Stanback funds the Environmental Working Group and the Waterkeeper Alliance. Both groups have a history of attacking Smithfield Foods and the pork industry in general. Southern Environmental Law Center As of 2020, Stanback served on the board of trustees of the Southern Environmental Law Center and was a member of its President's Council. Recognition In 2008, Stanback and his wife, Alice, received the North Carolina Award, the state's highest civilian honor, for their public service. Charitable giving In January 2020, Catawba College announced that it had received a gift from Stanback and his wife. They donated $1 million into scholarships for students majoring in humanities, the environment and sustainability, and education for a total gift of $3 million. As of 2020, Stanback served on the college's board of trustees.

He was a leading figure in the M community (Masisi, Madivin, Monkonpè, Makomè, Mix) in Haiti, as well as a human rights activist with his involvement in Kouraj. Charlot Jeudy was also a collaborator of Massimadi, the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti and Equitas.  Biography   Activism  Since 2009, Charlot Jeudy had struggling with his friends to demonstrate the importance of an organizational structure that promotes LGBT rights in Haiti as he had been the victim of several acts of discrimination. The idea of AMIAMI originated with the primary goal of creating cultural events in the LGBT community. After 2 years, AMIAMI became KOURAJ in December 2011, integrating other priorities such as the fight against homophobia and transphobia within Haitian society. Jeudy had the tenacity to make a first public statement in January 2012 on Haiti's national radio station, where he denounced Christians who advocated that it was \\"sins like homosexuality that were responsible for the January 12 earthquake\\". He was under pressure but persevered by planning another interview, this time on television, where he publicly stated that he was the president of KOURAJ, an organization defending the homosexual community. With the help of external partners, the first International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia was held in Haiti on May 17, 2012, to raise awareness among the Haitian population of the need to respect sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2013 KOURAJ was led by a team of 7 people of which he was the president and 70 active members. In an interview in 2016, Charlot Jeudy testified to the difficulty of being gay in Haiti on Radio-Canada. In the fall of 2016, Charlot Jeudy planned to launch the first Haitian edition of the Massimadi festival in Port-au-Prince. Massimadi Haiti was intended as an opportunity to present for the first time the realities of LGBTQ communities through films, exhibitions and discussions. It was based on a concept developed in 2009 by the Montreal-based organization Arc-en-ciel d'Afrique. Instead, the organisers must cancel everything, particularly because of the death threats to which some have been subjected, and the national turn and international media coverage of the subject in the news. On August 3, 2018, the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti unveiled a community-based intervention project led by LGBTI people. Its principle is to fight homophobia by promoting a culture of peace and positive values such as law, tolerance, equality, non-discrimination, respect for human life choices and human security. To this end, the MINUJUSTH Human Rights Section found a partner in the Kouraj association and its President Charlot Jeudy.  Death and reactions  On November 25, 2019, he was found dead at his home in Vivy Michel in the town of Pétion-Ville. According to initial reports, Charlot Jeudy died of poisoning or strangulation. The full circumstances of Charlot Jeudy's death have yet to be clarified. The French and American embassies condemned the strange circumstances of his death and asked for an investigation.

The provostry (on the left) on a painting by Jan Baptist van Meunincxhove from c. 1691-1700. The Provostry of St. Donatian (Dutch: Sint- Donaasproosdij or Proosdij van de kerkelijke heerlijkheid van Sint-Donaas) is a Baroque building on the Burg Square in Bruges, Belgium. Built in the 17th century, it served as the headquarters of the ecclesiastical seigniory of St. Donatian. History In 1089, under the rule of Robert I of Flanders, deans of St. Donatian's Cathedral were also given the role of chancellors of the County of Flanders. In this role, they were not only responsible for the administration of the county but also developed an important ecclesiastical seignory with its own administration and court. In 1560, Bruges for the first time became the seat of a bishopric, with Petrus Curtius as its first bishop. He was also given the role of dean and chancellor, which continued to be held by the 17 successive bishops who would rule the diocese until the end of the 18th century. The current building dates from 1665-1666 and was designed by Antwerp architect Cornelis Verhouven and canon Frederic Hillewerve (also from Antwerp). It was built in the triumphal Baroque style typical of the Counter- Reformation. The pronounced baroque style is typical of 17th-century Antwerp Baroque architecture and is unique in Bruges city centre. The huge door was an entrance way for horses and carriages. Lady Justice can be seen above and the Greek gods of truth, charity and justice can be seen on the top pediment. The elaborate carving is the work was Bruges sculptor Cornelis Gailliaert. Extensions and restorations The provostry originally consisted of two storeys and nine bays. In 1865, the right-hand side was extended by the addition of an extra half-bay and a new side wall. This was necessary, as the east wall – which was not meant to be seen – was exposed when St. Donatian's Cathedral was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century. The former provostry was given its current measurements in 1907 when it was extended by the addition of six bays on the left-hand side (towards the Markt) following the demolition of a number of houses. Architect Luc Dugardyn thoroughly restored the building from 1972 to 1974. The statues were also renewed in Lavaux stone by J. Dekeyzer (Langemark). The provostry was re-decorated again in 2001. It is now part of the official residence of the Governor of West Flanders.

Common Strategies  Boundary protection  Boundary protection employs security measures and devices to prevent unauthorized access to computer systems (referred to as controlling the system border). The approach is based on the assumption that the attacker did not penetrate the system. Examples of this strategy include using gateways, routers, firewalls, and password checks, deleting suspicious emails/messages, and limiting physical access. Boundary protection is typically the main strategy for computing systems; if this type of defense is successful, no other strategies are required. This is a resource-consuming strategy with a known scope. External information system monitoring is part of boundary protection.SI-4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING, NIST Special Publication 800-53  Information System Monitoring  Information System Monitoring employs security measures to find intruders or the damage done by them. This strategy is used when the system has been penetrated, but the intruder did not gain full control. Examples of this strategy include antivirus software, applying a patch, and network behavior anomaly detection. This strategy's success is based on competition of offence and defence. This is a time and resource-consuming strategy, affecting performance. The scope is variable in time. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies.  Unavoidable actions  Unavoidable actions employ security measures that cannot be prevented or neutralized. This strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but an intruder cannot prevent the defensive mechanism from being employed. Examples of this strategy include rebooting, using physical unclonable functions, and using a security switch.  Secure enclave  Secure enclave is a strategy that employs security measures that prevent access to some parts of the system. This strategy is used when the system has been penetrated, but an intruder cannot access its special parts. Examples of this strategy include using the Access level, using a Trusted Platform Module, using a microkernel, using Diode (unidirectional network device), and using air gaps. This is a supporting strategy for boundary protection, information system monitoring and unavoidable action strategies. This is a time and resource-consuming strategy with a known scope. Even if this strategy is fully successful, it does not guarantee the overall success of the larger defense strategy.  False target  False target is a strategy that deploys non-real targets for an intruder. It is used when the system has been penetrated, but the intruder does not know the system architecture. Examples of this strategy include honeypots, virtual computers, virtual security switches, fake files, and address/password copies. This is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time- consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies.  Moving target  Moving target is a security strategy based on frequent changes of data and processes. This strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder does not know the architecture of the system and its processes. Examples of this strategy are regular changes of passwords or keys (cryptography), using a dynamic platform, etc. This is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies. Actions are activated on a scheduled basis or as a response to a detected threat.  Useless information  Useless information comprises security measures to turn important information into useless data for an intruder. The strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder is not able to decrypt information, or does not have enough time to decrypt it. For example, encrypting the file system or using encryption software can render the data useless even if an attacker gets access to the file system, or using data masking, were sensitive data is hidden in non-sensitive data with modified content. This is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time and resource-consuming strategy, affecting performance. The scope is known. It cannot be successful if not supported by other strategies. Claude Shannon's theorems show that if the encryption key is smaller than the secured information, the information-theoretic security can not be achieved. There is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system: the one-time pad. This strategy is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without the risk of being compromised. Other cryptographic systems are only buying time or can be broken. ( see Cryptographic hash function , Degree of difficulty.) This strategy needs to be supported by the moving target or deletes strategies.  Deletion  Deletion is a strategy using security measures to prevent an intruder from gaining sensitive information at all costs. The strategy is based on the assumption that the damage from information disclosure would be greater than the damage caused by deleting the information or disabling the system required to gain access to the information. The strategy is part of the data-centric security approach. Examples of this strategy include information deletion as a response to a security violation (such as unauthorized access attempts) and password resets. This is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful on its own since the detected intrusion is not quarantined.  Information redundancy  Information redundancy is a strategy performing security measures to keep redundancy for information and using it in case of damage. The strategy is based on the assumption that finding and repairing the damage is more complicated than the restoration of the system. Examples of this strategy include using system restoration, keeping backup files, and using a backup computer. This is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. This strategy consumes considerable resources, and the scope is known. It can be fully successful in its part.  Limiting of actions made by a robot  Limiting of actions made by a robot is a strategy performing security measures to limit a robot's (software bot) actions. The strategy is based on the assumption that a robot can take more actions, or create damage that a human cannot create. Examples of this strategy include using anti-spam techniques, using CAPTCHA and other human presence detection techniques, and using DDS-based defense (protection from Denial-of-service attack). This is a supporting strategy for boundary protection and information system monitoring. It is a time and resource- consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. This strategy cannot be fully successful on its own.  Active defense  Active defense is a strategy performing security measures attacking the potential intruders. The strategy is based on the assumption that a potential intruder under attack has fewer abilities. Examples of this strategy include creating and using lists of trusted networks, devices, and applications, blocking untrusted addresses, and vendor management. This is a supporting strategy for boundary protection and information system monitoring. It is a time and resource- consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. This strategy cannot be fully successful on its own.  Unavoidable actions  This strategy can support any other strategy., Best two-factor AuthenticationPUF based encryptionDesign and implementation of Hardware-assisted security architecture for software integrity monitoringReal-time Captcha technique improves biometric authentication This is a resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. An implementation may have a wide impact on devices.Adding kill switches to protect your privacy is not as simple as you might think This strategy can be fully successful, but in most cases, there is a trade-off of full system functionality for security. This strategy can be used proactively or reactively. Actions done in response to an already detected problem may be too late.Consumer Watchdog raises the alarm about connected cars with misguided report Any implementation needs to be supported by the secure enclave strategy in order to prevent neutralizing action by unauthorized access to the protection mechanism. Actions can be of the following types : *Preventive actions - blocking certain functions, signals, peripheral devices, memory parts, and/or data transfers. For example: blocking audio/video recording, the sending of long messages, or secret memory access. *Creative actions - activating certain functions, sending signals, messages, and/or data. For example: sending an alarm signal or message, or activating data copying or transfer. *Modification actions - modifying a peripheral device's functioning, or modifying the data, signals or processes of the defended system. For example, independent hardware encryption/decryption, changing accelerometer accuracy, filtering messages or words, or changing state diagram or algorithm by independent hardware.

As of 6 January 2020, there were over 5,700 cases of measles and 83 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,874. Over three percent of the population were infected. The cause of the outbreak was attributed to decreased vaccination rates, from 74% in 2017 to 31–34% in 2018, even though nearby islands had rates near 99%. A state of emergency was declared on 17 November, ordering the closure of all schools, keeping children under 17 away from public events, and vaccination became mandatory. On 2 December 2019, the government imposed a curfew and cancelled all Christmas celebrations and public gatherings. All unvaccinated families were ordered to display a red flag or cloth in front of their homes to warn others and to aid mass vaccination efforts. Some families added messages like \\"Help!\\" or \\"I want to live!\\". On 5 and 6 December, the government shut down everything to bring civil servants over to the vaccination campaign. This curfew was lifted on 7 December when the government estimated that the vaccination program had reached 90% of the population. On 14 December, the state of emergency was extended to 29 December. Samoan anti- vaccination activist Edwin Tamasese was arrested and charged with \\"incitement against a government order\\". Finally, as of 22 December, an estimated 94% of the eligible population had been vaccinated. Background Hypothetical measles timeline from exposure to illness Measles first arrived in Samoa in 1893, carried by a steamer from New Zealand. By the end of 1893, over 1,000 people (of a total population of 34,500 at that time) had died from the disease. In the early part of 2019, measles has been spreading throughout the Pacific region, with outbreaks in Tonga, Fiji, the Philippines and New Zealand. In March 2019, the WHO and UN children's agency UNICEF warned the Pacific to take proactive measures and improve immunisation rates. 2019 outbreak In August 2019, an infected passenger on one of the more than 8,000 annual flights between New Zealand and Samoa probably brought the disease from Auckland to Upolu. A full outbreak began in October 2019 and continued for the next four months. As of 22 December, there were 79 deaths (0.4 per 1,000, based on a population of 200,874, a rate of 14.3 deaths per 1000 infected) and 5,520 cases (2.75% of the population) of measles in Samoa. 61 out of the first 70 deaths were aged four and under and all but seven were aged under 15. At least 20% of babies aged six to 11 months have contracted measles, and one in 150 babies have died. As of 20 December, 94% of the population had been vaccinated. 95% is required to acquire herd immunity for measles. Measles is much more contagious compared to other infectious diseases such as polio, which only requires an 80% vaccination rate for the population to attain herd immunity. Vaccine hesitancy The outbreak has been attributed to a sharp drop in measles vaccination from the previous year. In 2013, 90% of babies in Samoa received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination at one year of age. On 6 July 2018 on the east coast of Savai'i, two 12-month-old children died after receiving MMR vaccinations. The cause of death was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with expired anaesthetic instead of the appropriate diluent. These two deaths were picked up by anti- vaccine groups and used to incite fear towards vaccination on social media, causing the government to suspend its measles vaccination programme for ten months, despite advice from the WHO. The incident caused many Samoan residents to lose trust in the healthcare system. After the outbreak started, anti- vaxxers credited the deaths to poverty and poor nutrition or even to the vaccine itself, but this has been discounted by the international emergency medical support that arrived in November and December. There has been no evidence of acute malnutrition, clinical vitamin A deficiency or immune deficiency as claimed by various anti-vaxxers. UNICEF and the World Health Organization estimate that the measles vaccination rate in Samoa fell from 74% in 2017 to 34% in 2018, similar to some of the poorest countries in Africa. Ideally, countries should have immunisation levels above 90%. Prior to the outbreak, vaccination rates had dropped to 31% in Samoa, compared to 99% in nearby Nauru, Niue, Cook Islands, and American Samoa. Before seeking proper medical treatment, some parents first took their children to 'traditional healers' who used machines purchased from Australia that are claimed to produce immune-protective water. Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji have all declared states of emergency to tackle their 2019 measles outbreaks. The high mortality rate in Samoa is attributed to the country's low vaccination rate (31%). In Tonga and Fiji, the lack of fatalities is explained by far higher vaccination rates. Government response Initially, schools remained open after the outbreak was declared. The Samoan government initially did not accept humanitarian support. A state of emergency was declared on 17 November, ordering the closure of all schools, keeping children under 17 away from public events, and making vaccination mandatory. UNICEF has sent 110,500 vaccines to Samoa. Tonga and Fiji have also declared states of emergency. Tonga closed all schools for several days, while American Samoa required all travellers from Tonga and Samoa to present proof of vaccination. In Fiji, vaccines are being prioritised for young children and people travelling overseas. On 2 December 2019, the government imposed a curfew and cancelled all Christmas celebrations and public gatherings. All unvaccinated families were ordered to display a red flag or red cloth in front of their homes to warn others and to aid mass vaccination efforts. As part of aid efforts, the Royal New Zealand Air Force has transported medical supplies and equipment to Samoa. Also, New Zealand, Australian, British, French Polynesian, and French medical teams have been assisting Samoan medical authorities. On 5 and 6 December, the government shut down everything other than public utilities to assign all available civil servants to the vaccination campaign efforts. Edwin Tamasese, an anti-vaccination activist with no medical training who is also the chair of a coconut farmers’ collective, was charged with \\"incitement against a government order\\". He had posted online comments like “Enjoy your killing spree.” He encouraged people to refuse immunisation, as he believed the vaccine caused measles, and even discouraged life-saving antibiotics. Tamasese faces up to two years in prison. The curfew was lifted on 7 December when the government estimated that 90% of the population had been reached by the vaccination program. Parliament passed a bill on 19 December to make measles vaccinations mandatory in 2020. Nevertheless, as of 29 December, a public inquiry into the government's role in suspending vaccinations had not been announced. Deputy director of health Gaualofa Matalavea Saaga stated, \\"Having our case blasted out to the world is the last thing we want.\\" Samoa's political opposition called for the health minister to be removed from his position. On 31 December, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, the Prime Minister of Samoa, addressed the nation to ring in the New Year; the measles outbreak was a focus of his speech. He acknowledged the support of the Samoan diaspora and 49 medical teams from the following countries and organisations: Australia, China, France/French Polynesia, Fiji through UNFPA, Israel, United States/Hawaii, Japan, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Norway, United Nations Agencies, United Kingdom and UK Save the Children, Solomon Islands and Kiribati through the Pacific Community, American Samoa, Médecins Sans Frontières, Blacktown Doctors Medical Centre, and Samoan Doctors Worldwide. International response The low vaccination rate of Samoa came as a surprise to New Zealand's government. The Samoa Observer reported that New Zealand's Minister for Pacific People, William Sio, was\\" 'of the impression' that Samoa had high immunisation rates. So to learn they were in fact low was a shock.\\" Since the outbreak, several organisations and countries have responded: * Australian Medical Assistance Teams (AUSMAT) sent a team of nurses, doctors, and public health experts as well as medical equipment and supplies to Samoa and left on 3 January 2020 after eight weeks in Samoa in one of its longest-ever missions. * New Zealand sent three rotations of the New Zealand Medical Assistance Team (NZMAT) of doctors, nurses and logistics specialists who supported Leulumoega Hospital and Faleolo Clinic to the west of Apia for six weeks. NZ also sent a team of nurse vaccinators, 3,000 vaccination doses and vaccine fridges to Samoa in mid-November, and a small number of Intensive Care Clinicians. Residents of Rotorua, New Zealand sent two dozen infant-size coffins decorated with flowers and butterflies to Samoan families. On 14 December 2019, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced $1 million in funds towards preventive efforts in the Pacific. * The United Kingdom EMT sent two rotations of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, an anaesthetist, and an epidemiologist for four weeks of support from the end of November to December 2019. * French Polynesia sent a team of paediatric nurses * Israel sent Intensive Care teams to Samoa to help with relief efforts. * Hawaii sent a medical mission of 75 doctors and nurses for two days at the beginning of December to assist with the mass vaccination campaign. * On 10 December, American Samoa declared a measles outbreak and closed public schools and park gatherings and suspended all entry permits for those travelling through Samoa and Tonga to American Samoa. * UNICEF has sent 110,500 vaccines to Samoa. * The World Bank gave a US$3.5 million grant to support the response to the outbreak and another US$9.3m grant over the next five years to improve the health system. * Israel sent a team of two paediatricians, six nurses and one physiotherapist trained in disaster medicine from the Israel Center for Disaster Medicine and Humanitarian Response. Others As of 24 December, the following agencies had sent Emergency Medical Team personnel to assist with the outbreak:  Aftermath  Tuilaepa said he would propose legislation that would penalise parents who refused to vaccinate their children. The Samoan government allocated US$2.5 million for relief work. Immunology experts are now questioning the role of social media, primarily Facebook, and how social media facilitated the spread of vaccination hesitancy during the lethal outbreak. The Immunisation Advisory Centre in New Zealand sees the Samoan crisis as a sign that social media needs to deal with dangerous misinformation. As of 25 January 2020, Tuilaepa has so far resisted calls for an inquiry. Opposition MP Olo Fiti Va'ai continues to call for an inquiry and was \\"apologising on behalf of Parliament and telling the people of Samoa that the government had failed miserably.\\" See also  References  Measles outbreak Category:2019 measles outbreaks Category:2010s disasters in Oceania 2019 measles outbreak Category:October 2019 events in Oceania Category:November 2019 events in Oceania Category:December 2019 events in Oceania ","title":"2019 Samoa measles outbreak"},{"id":"62436047","text":"Hellmut Theimer (born 15 February 1928) was an Austrian water polo player.

Etymology The Latin species name florisomne refers to the habit of some males to sleep inside the buttercup flowers. Distribution and habitat The area of distribution covers most of Europe (Austria, Belgium, British Islands, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, European Russia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland) and North Africa.Fauna Europaea These bees occur in forests, meadow, slopes and orchards, where buttercups (Ranunculus species) are present. Description Chelostoma florisomne can reach a body length of about .M Edwards BWARS - Bees, Wasps & Ants Recording Society These bees have a slender, cylindrical shaped black body, with white short fringe bands along the posterior margins of the tergites, that are usually filled with pollen of the preferred pollen host. Head is subquadrate, with very prominent mandibles. Especially females show very long projecting mandibles and labrum. Males are characterized by a wedge-shaped projection that arises from sternite 2. This species is very similar to Chelostoma campanularum. Biology The species has only one generation per year (univoltine). Adults fly from May to July. The females usually build their nests in old beetle burrows found in dead wood, but they also may use hollow plant stalks. It has a aspecialized preference (oligolecty) for the flowers of Ranunculus species (mainly Ranunculus acris, Ranunculus bulbosus, Ranunculus repens, Ranunculus lanuginosus).Chelostoma florisomne Recorded parasites of this species are Monosapyga clavicornisWildebijen and Gasteruption jaculator.

The film features Yohaa and Poornitha in lead roles, with R. Sundarrajan, Crane Manohar, Muthukalai, Tharika, Akilan, Lochan, Rajesh and Marina playing supporting roles. The film, produced by S. Sundaravalli, had musical score by Dhina and was released on 13 October 2006. Plot The film begins with the young man Yohaa (Yohaa) arriving in Chennai and he starts working as a delivery boy at a gas agency. He lives at the house of his employer (R. Sundarrajan). Yohaa's only aim in life is to join the army. With a problem erupting between Yohaa and his employer's family, Yohaa fearing of the police, escapes from there in his employer's car. After driving for approximately 300 kilometres, Yohaa finds his employer's daughter Renuka (Poornitha) in the back seat of the car who was sleeping all along. Renuka first gets angry and scolds Yohaa for kidnapping her. Yohaa tells her that he didn't do it on purpose and he should not have a police record if he wants to become a serviceman. Renuka sympathises with his plight and they travel to Vijayawada to meet Yohaa's friend Varadhan (Rajesh), a sub-inspector of police, who will help him out of his problems. In the past, Yohaa lived happily in Vijayawada with his parents and he dreamt to become a serviceman. His father then died of a heart attack. Yohaa moved with his mother to his uncle's house in Nellore and he was eagerly waiting for the appointment order from the government. His uncle wanted him to marry his daughter Lalli (Marina) but Yohaa didn't want to marry her. Lalli was in love with another man, she slowly became depressed and started to have mental issues. One day, after a fight with his uncle, Yohaa ran away from the house and came to Chennai. Back to the present, Yohaa and Renula fall in love with each other during the trip. In Vijayawada, Varadhan promises to help them and he advises Yohaa to retrieve the appointment order and his certificates which are in his uncle's house. After taking the documents, Yohaa and Renuka run away from Yohaa's uncle and get on a train. A lawyer, sympathetic to their plight, decides to help them: he stops the train and holds the train driver hostage. The incident receives heavy media attention and the government pressures the police to solve the issue as soon as possible. The lawyer demands the police to organize their marriage on the spot and to not arrest Yohaa and the police accept. The young lovers get off the train and they finally get married. The film ends with Yohaa becoming a serviceman and living happily with his wife Renuka. Cast *Yohaa as Yohaa *Poornitha as Renuka *R.

Pangdam XVI / Pattimura Commander who is now in control is Maj. Gen. Dr. Marga Taufiq, S.H., M.H. Former Commander in Chief Divif 2 / Kostrad.  Kodam XVI / Pattimura Task  As the Development Kotama, Operational Kotama and regional Command, the 16th RMC is entrusted with the following: # Carry out the tasks of TNI land dimensions in the region of North Maluku and Maluku. # Implement security of the North Maluku and Maluku regions bordering other countries. # Carry out the construction and development of the strength of the land force TNI in North Maluku and Maluku. # Implement the empowerment of land defense areas according to their role and authority and realize the unity of the People's TNI. # Carry out other tasks in accordance with statutory regulations and laws of the Republic.  History  In the summer of 1950, southern parts of the Maluku Islands, with majority Christian populations, were rebel territory with the proclamation of the so-called Republic of South Maluku (RMS), and its army was mainly composed of demobilized ex-Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) soldiers and other South Moluccan men who remained loyal to the Dutch crown, even during the days of the United States of Indonesia wherein Maluku was one of its constituent states. The Indonesian government, represented by then Minister of Defense Abdul Halim and the Commander of the National Armed Forces, MGen T. B. Simatupang, was very much furious with this act of rebellion, and by late August, President Sukarno was convinced that the time had time for the Army to assert the authority of the by now unitary national government in these islands, which during the National Revolution saw fighting between the regular Dutch forces and their pro-Dutch supporters and pro-republic Christian and Muslim inhabitants. In response, the elements of the then Sulawesi-based 7th Terrtorial Army Command Eastern Indonesia, which had the Maluku islands are part of its area of responsibility, began to draw up plans for a military operations movement called \\"South Maluku Army Command\\" with operational commander Colonel Alexander Kawilarang (TA Commander for Eastern Indonesia), which was then handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Slamet Riyadi. The South Maluku Army Command, late in August, was charged with the invasion of the Buru, Seram, Ambon and Lease islands to reclaim the islands from the hands of the RMS government through guerilla operations. After succeeding in its operations movement, the Chief of Staff of the Army on August 30, 1950 ordered the transformation of the South Maluku Army Command into the D Force Command (KOMPAS D ) under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel J.F. Warouw and composed partly of the Christians and Muslims of Maluku who supported the government in Jakarta. That force was the main local formation that helped the Army win the Invasion of Ambon in the early fall of 1950. The D Force Command on July 5, 1952 was later transformed into the 25th Infantry Regiment, 7th TA under the leadership of its first regimental commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sukowati. A Decree of the Chief of Staff of the Army May 27, 1957 established the Maluku and West Irian Regional Military Command (KDM-MIB), with the first Commander being Colonel Herman Pieters and on October 24, 1959 the Maluku and West Irian Military Regional Command was changed to the Maluku West Irian Military Region \\"Pattimura\\" (MIB \\"Pattimura\\"), the honorific recalling the bravery of the local nakesake hero who in 1817 fought valiantly against Dutch administration in the islands for abuses against the people. On May 7, 1960, Major General AH Nasution, Commander of the Armed Forces, handed over the command colour to the commanding officer of the military region, COL Herman Pieters. Later on, it became Kodam XV/Pattimura with the separation of West Papua to form its own military command. For service to the homeland and loyalty to Pancasila and the Constitution of 1945, as well as instilling the values of patriotism and civil-military community development to the peoples of the Moluccas, Kodam XV / Pattimura was later on awarded by President Suharto with the Presidential Unit Citation (Armed Forces) (Samkarya Nugraha).  Korem 174 / Pattimura period  In accordance with the development of the strategic concept of Defense and Security in general and whole of the Armed Forces in particular, several TNI AD Commands (Kotama) including Kodam XV / Pattimura were merged to other regional commands according to the demands of military reorganization policies of the then Commander of the Armed Forces, General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani in a General Orders signed on 22 September 1984. Then, in accordance with a Decree of the Chief of Staff of the Army dated December 26, 1984 and realized with the Decree of the Military Commander XV / Pattimura on January 8, 1985, the 174th Military Area Command Pattimura was formed which covered the entire Kodam XV/ Pattimura area of operations. On May 6, 1985, Brigadier General H. Simanjuntak handed the command colour of the 15th RMC to the then Chief of Staff of the Army, General TNI Rudini, officially dissolving the regional command. With psychological and historical considerations, the name Pattimura was retained as the newly formed Korem name with Col. Inf Soeharsono S appointed as the first area commander, who reported under the command of the newly formed Kodam XVII /Trikora, with HQ located in Jayapura, Papua.  Kodam XVI / Pattimura period  After decades of peace, in the aftermath of the fall of Suharto from power sectarian violence flared in the islands in the 1999-2002 Maluku sectarian conflict. With the threat of religious violence spreading into the now twin provinces of the Maluku Islands the National Armed Forces made it clear that the diversity of the island's peoples and religions were at stake and a territorial reorganization was needed to ensure a stronger military presence. Pursuant to several orders by the office of the Chief of Staff of the Army, on May 7, 1999 the 174th MAC was dissolved and in its place Kodam XVI/Pattimura was reactivated on May 15, 1999 in Ambon during a Military Ceremony presided by the Chief of Staff General TNI Subagyo HS. On the occasion of the ceremony the Chief of Staff officially inaugurated Brigadier General Max M.Tamaela as the first regional commander and the historic day was subsequently celebrated as the Anniversary of Kodam XVI / Pattimura. Reborn in the face of interreligious violence, today the 16th RMC is committed to help contribute to national defense and territorial integrity, as well as in community development. It was the servicemen of this command, in the aftermath of the Malino II Accord of 2002, that helped the peoples of Maluku recover from the years of violence that divided the Christian and Muslim communities, and thus helped the transformation of these frontier islands of the east into havens of diversity.

He is a prime suspect in the Gypsy Hill killings, a series of murders of young women in San Mateo County, California (and possibly Reno, Nevada), whose killer was named The San Mateo Slasher. In March 2014, based on DNA profiling, Halbower was named as a person of interest in the murders. By this time, Cathy Woods, a mental patient who was convicted for one of the victims' murders, was exonerated after 35 years behind bars. At the time of his identification, Halbower himself was imprisoned for 38 years in Oregon.  Early years  Rodney Halbower was born on June 27, 1948, in Wisconsin. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Muskegon, Michigan, where Rodney spent his childhood and youth. He grew up in a socially disadvantageous environment, and began to show signs of anti-social behaviour as a child. During his school years, due to being introverted, Rodney was characterized with low sociability and deviance towards other students and staff, as a result of which he gained reputation as a bully. He was a frequent truant, as a result of which his school performance fell off completely by the early 1960s. After an arrest for participation in a hijacking, Rodney was kicked out of school and sent to an institution for juvenile offenders, after which he resumed his newfound criminal career.  Criminal career  In 1963, Halbower was released on parole, but quickly violated the conditions of his probation, and in 1964, at the age of 16, he was sent back to prison. Released the following year, Rodney burglarized a house, for which he was arrested, but managed to flee from the country prison in September. A few days later, he was captured, convicted and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. After his release, he worked honestly for a short period, before turning to crime again. Rodney was arrested again in 1970 for theft, of which he was convicted and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment. A few months later, Halbower managed to make another escape, but was soon rearrested and returned to prison. For that escape, he was given an additional term. In 1975, he was paroled, and after his release, Halbower left Michigan and moved to Nevada, settling in Reno. In December of that year, he attacked a girl, during which he beat and raped her. The victim survived and Rodney was arrested, but released on bail and remained at large during the preliminary investigation, which ended in the spring of 1976. In May, his trial began, during which he was found guilty of assaulting the girl and received a sentence of life imprisonment. In June 1977, during a softball match in the territory near the Carson City prison, Halbower managed to escape. He was put on a wanted list, but successfully eluded police. In July 1977, the criminal was unexpectedly detained in Muskegon while attempting to kidnap his 7-year-old daughter. Halbower was extradited to Nevada to serve his sentence for the rape charges. He was not tried for kidnapping his daughter, but he was accused of fleeing from prison, for which he was later given a 6-year sentence. On December 15, 1976, Halbower, together with his 23-year-old accomplice Orlando Jaime, made another escape from the prison, climbing on the roof of one of the buildings along the wall, reaching the fence and escaping. The investigation revealed that the escape was possible due to improper performance of duties by the guards, who were subsequently subjected to disciplinary action. Once reincarcerated, in September 1978, Halbower attempted to escape from Nevada State Maximum Security Prison, but was captured before clearing a final fence. He had managed to cut through 3 sets of bars, one on his cell, another on the tier outside the cell, and a third set of bars on the window of the Cellhouse. He was within 100 yards of freedom when a guard in the Cellhouse saw movement outside, and notified the guard in the tower above the Cellhouse. After shots were fired, Halbower surrendered, and was escorted back into the prison. After escaping yet again, Halbower stole a car and drove to Oregon, where he attacked a girl in Jackson, raping and stabbing her several times. The victim survived and identified Rodney, who was arrested in early 1987 and convicted in March for rape and assault. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, but was extradited back to Nevada, so he could continue serving his life imprisonment term. He was released from prison on parole in November 2013, but was immediately extradited to Oregon to serve his 15-year term for rape and attempted murder.  Gypsy Hill killings  On January 8, 1976, the body of 18-year-old Veronica Cascio was discovered in a creek on the grounds of the Sharp Park Golf Course in Pacifica. The girl had suffered about 30 stab wounds. A few weeks later, 14-year-old Tanya Blackwell went missing after leaving her home in Pacifica. A body, later identified as hers, was discovered on June 6 at Sharp Park Road, in a wooded area of the city known as Gypsy Hills. Like Cascio, she also had been stabbed many times. On February 2, 17-year-old Paula Baxter went missing, with her naked body found two days later in Millbrae. She had been stabbed four times, was sexually assaulted and suffered multiple head injuries from a blunt object. On April 1, 19-year-old Denise Lampe, from Broadmoor, was found dead in Daly City. The killer had inflicted more than 20 knife wounds on the victim. On May 6, the skeletonized remains of a girl were found in a shallow grave at San Francisco. She was later identified as 26-year-old Carol Booth, reported missing since March 15. She had been sexually assaulted. All of the victims, with the exception of Booth, were killed in San Mateo County. The lack of witnesses and forensic evidence halted the investigations for decades.  Exposure  Since 2013, Halbower was serving his sentence in one of the Oregon prisons, with a set release date of 2026. During his incarceration, a blood sample was taken from him for DNA testing, which, in September 2014, showed correspondence of his genotypic profile with the profile of the man who had left biological evidence on the corpses of Paula Baxter and Veronica Cascio. The study also showed that Halbower's DNA profile coincided with the one isolated from saliva on cigarette butts found near the body of Michelle Mitchell, who was killed in February 1976 in Reno, Nevada. In 1980, mental patient Cathy Woods was convicted of Mitchell's murder. In 2014, DNA testing proved her innocence, after which the charges were dropped. In 2015, Woods was released, after spending 35 years in prison. Rodney Halbower was extradited to California, where, in January 2015, he was charged with three of the murders, to which he pled not guilty. In addition, Halbower was suspected in Denise Lampe's murder, but testing of the DNA blood stains, left on the girl's body, showed a mismatch with Rodney's profile. Based on the results of the DNA study, 71-year-old Leon Seymour was later charged with the Lampe killing.  Trial  Rodney Lynn Halbower was extradited to California in January 2015, but the trial was constantly delayed for various reasons. In 2016, Halbower was sent in for forensic examination, and it was determined that he wasn't suffering from mental illnesses or abnormalities, and thus, in June, a verdict was issued on his sanity. In the same year, Halbower filed a petition to refuse qualified legal assistance and lawyers, and a petition to represent himself at trial, but a judge denied them, as a number of experts proved that he was too incompetent to appear before the court without a proper defense team. His trial began on August 20, 2018. At the trial, Halbower was in a very positive mood, refused to plead guilty, and frequently argued with the judge and prosecutors. On September 18, 2018, Rodney Halbower was found guilty by the jury for the murders of Cascio and Baxter, and received two life sentences for each. Despite the fact there isn't enough evidence to accuse him of Blackwell and Booth's killing, they are also believed to have been committed by Halbower. As of 2019, he is expecting extradition to Nevada, where Halbower is due to stand trial for the murder of Michelle Mitchell.

She was a student of the arts in Kyoto, studying painting, calligraphy, music, chanting, and poetry. Her work was noticed by members of the Tokugawa shogunate, including Tokugawa Ieyasu and Tokugawa Hidetada, and she was often hired by them to teach members of their court. Because she was the author of works that impacted Japanese art during the Azuchi-Momoyama and Edo period, and served several prominent figures, Otsū was proclaimed one of the leading female calligraphers of premodern Japan.  Biography  Ono Otsū was born in 1559 into a noble samurai family, but there is not much informations about her early life. According to some sources, Ono Masahide, an ally of Oda Nobunaga and owner of a fiefdom in Mino province, would take care of Ono Otsū after the death of her father. She may have married a daimyo of Noto province and then relocated to Kyoto following the death of her husband in battle. In the capital, she studied arts, including wakacomposition with the nobleman Kujō Tanemichi (1507–1594) and was subsequently welcomed into aristocratic and high-ranking military circles. Learned writing from Kanoe Nobutada, a member of the Emperor's court in Kyoto, one of the Three Calligraphers of Konoe. She worked throughout her life as a lady-in-waiting in the courts of families of important leaders such as Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Tokugawa Hidetada. Skilled in poetry, she also tried her hand at calligraphy, painting, music, and cha no yu (tea ceremony). She became famous for her artistic talent and taught both poetry and calligraphy at the various courts. During her life, she was said to have served Fujiwara no Haruko (Emperor Go-Yōzei's mother), Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Kodai-in (Nene), Yodo-dono. Some accounts even declare that she served in the retinue of Tokugawa Masako, the chief consort of Emperor Go-Mizunoo and mother of Empress Meishō. She was also said to be close to the daimyo of Ueda Domain and Matsushiro domain, Sanada Nobuyuki. Otsū apparently married a member of the Toyotomi clan, but they divorced due to her husband's alcoholism. After this, she became a tutor for a noblewoman. Known works Celebrated above all as a calligrapher, Ono Otsū was also important for her paintings in which she placed a calligraphic inscription on the image. Her style of calligraphy marked by ornamental decorations became a great inspiration for women of the highest castes of the Edo period. She was thought to be the author of the Joruri Monogatari, the precursor to Joruri. She created distinctive style calligraphy, decorated sheets of decorated paper in a pair of albums with scenes from The Tale of Genji painted by an anonymous artist from the Tosa school. Otsū wrote mainly in kana, interspersed with extravagant kanji for poetically evocative words. The variations, sometimes subtle, sometimes dramatic, in the weight of the brushstrokes and the radical spacing between the characters and groups of characters are hallmarks of her style. Otsū also demonstrated her mastery of the “scattered writing” technique, by which she skillfully placed the poem's records on the page and sometimes positioned the lines of the poem out of sequence. She was also known for her paintings of Zen Buddhism subjects in monochrome ink in the traditional style. Selections of her calligraphy are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including a 1624 piece known as Hotei with a child.

Tripp Jr (1920-1971) was an American naval architect who created many popular wooden and later fiberglass sailboat designs. Tripp used the diminutive, Bill, as his usual first name. Life Tripp was a native of Long Island, New York. He started as a yacht designer working for Phillip Rhodes, before the Second World War. After returning from his military service in the war he worked for Sparkman & Stevens. In 1952 Tripp started his own design firm with Bill Campbell, Tripp & Campbell, located in a small office on the seventh floor of 10 Rockefeller Plaza. One of his early wooden boat designs, a 48-foot flush-deck sloop was bulit by German shipbuilder Abeking and Rasmussen designed for Jack Potter of Oyster Bay, Long Island and named Touche. It accumulated a successful race record and elevated Tripp's reputation as a designer, bringing him many commissions for new boats. Tripp began experimenting with a new material for hull construction and began designing boats for fiberglass, becoming a pioneer in the field. Tripp was not only a designer, but also an accomplished sailor and sailed many of his own designs. Tripp was not happy with his professional partnership with Campbell and dissolved the company and formed his own, based in his home town of Port Washington, New York. Campbell found a new partner, Dick Sheehan and carried on as Campbell/Sheehan. Biographer Ted Jones wrote of Tripp's designs: \\"Thinking back, I can see many innovations Bill’s fertile imagination introduced. While he did not create the wide beam, shallow draft centerboarder ... he surely refined the type to the extent that he became associated with centerboard racing/cruising boats. The wide transom, low counter design of his boats’ sterns were quite new in the late 1950s, causing many derisive comments among traditionalists, but I don’t hear anyone laughing about the shape of the Bermuda 40’s stern anymore ... He designed boats to stay together under the most difficult circumstances. I cannot recall one of his designs ever being dismasted or suffering structural damage at sea.\\" Death Tripp died in 1971 in an automobile accident, at age 51. Tripp was killed by a drunk driver on the Connecticut Turnpike. The other driver lost control of his car and crossed the road divider, colliding with Tripp’s Jaguar. Tripp's son, William H. Tripp III is also a yacht designer. Biographer Ted Jones wrote, \\"Bill’s son, Billy, was too young at the time of his father’s death to be able to understand what it was that made his father’s boat designs special, yet he has now exceeded his father in this specialized field.\\" Designs The Tripp-designed Columbia 34 Mark II *Bermuda 40-1 (Hinckley) - 1959 *Bermuda 40-2 (Hinckley) - 1968 *Bermuda 40-3 (Hinckley) - 1971 *Block Island 40 - 1957 *Block Island 40 (Migrator) - 1984 *Columbia 26 Mark II - 1969 *Columbia 27 - 1970 *Columbia 30 - 1971 *Columbia 32 - 1975 *Columbia 34 Mark II - 1970 *Columbia 35 - 1975 *Columbia 39 - 1970 *Columbia 41 - 1972 *Columbia 43 - 1969 *Columbia 43 CB - 1969 *Columbia 43 Mark III - 1973 *Columbia 45 - 1971 *Columbia 45 Ketch - 1971 *Columbia 50 - 1965 *Columbia 52 - 1971 *Columbia 56 - 1974 *Columbia 57 - 1969 *Coronado 27 - 1970 *Coronado 32 - 1973 *Coronado 34 - 1966 *Coronado 35 - 1971 *Coronado 35 MS - 1971 *Coronado 41 - 1972 *Coronado 45 - 1974 *Galaxy 32 - 1957 *Galaxy 32-3 - 1970 *Grampian 46 - 1969 *Hinckley 48 - 1965 *Hughes 36 - 1971 *Hughes-Columbia 36 - 1979 *Invicta (Tripp) - 1960 *Invicta II (Tripp) - 1964 *Javelin 38 (Tripp) - 1960 *Le Comte 52 - 1965 *Le Comte ALC 35 - 1968 *Le Comte ALC 35 Mark II - 1971 *Le Comte Medalist 33 Mark I - 1962 *Le Comte Medalist 33 Mark II - 1965 *Le Comte Ocean Racer 52 - 1968 *Mercer 44 - 1959 *Northeast 38-1 - 1962 *Northeast 38-2 - 1966 *Northeast 38-3 - 1969 *Oceanic 48 (Tripp) - 1962 *Paceship 32 (Tripp) - 1968 *Polaris 26 (Tripp) - 1960 *Tripp Resolute - 1955 *Sailcrafter 32 - 1977 *Sailcrafter 50 - 1971 *Sailmaster 26 - 1963 *Santander 30 (Tripp) - 1966 *Seafarer 31 Mark I - 1968 *Seafarer 31 Mark I Yawl - 1968 *Seaman 30 - 1955 *Tripp 30 (Seafarer) - 1963 *Tripp Lentsch 29 - 1963 *US Yachts US 41 - 1963 *US Yachts US 46 - 1968 *Watkins 32 - 1982 *Watkins 33 - 1984 *Watkins 36 - 1981 *Watkins 36C - 1981 References Category:American yacht designers Category:1920 births Category:1971 deaths ","title":"William H.

In 1937, Soemanang (who had entered politics and joined the Gerindo political party) founded a weekly publication in Bogor, named Perantaraan. He later proposed the founding of a national news agency. Alongside other young politically active journalists such as Sanusi Pane and Adam Malik, they founded the Antara news agency which derived its name from Perantaraan. Soemanang became the agency's first chief editor. The following year, he left Antara and became the head of the school replacing Amir Sjarifuddin. He continued to work in journalism, becoming the chief editor of the Pemandangan newspaper in 1940. Sumanang participated in the First Indonesian Language Congress in Surakarta on 25 June 1938, which aimed to standardize the Indonesian language - then recently declared as the national language following the 1928 Youth Pledge. Sumanang had offered to gather influential businesspeople and scholars to the congress after a spontaneous request by fellow journalist Soedarjo Tjokrosisworo. Japanese occupation During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Soemanang worked in the Japanese-founded Asia Raya newspaper and later headed the press department of the labor organization . During this period, he had been arrested due to a photo published in Pemandangan showing the Japanese Emperor Hirohito obscured by the Japanese flag. Another incident close to the end of the war saw Soemanang arrested for another image of Hirohito stained by red ink from the flag, and resulted in the Japanese authorities forcing Pemandangan to be published as Pembangoenan. Post-independence Shortly after the proclamation of Indonesian independence, Sumanang co-founded the National Press Company (Badan Usaha Penerbitan Nasional). In 1946, the Indonesian Journalists Association was founded, and Soemanang was elected as its first chairman. He further founded the daily newspaper Nasional (today Bernas) in Yogyakarta in November 1946, in addition to the magazines Wanita Indonesia and Revue Indonesia, and Javanese-language pamphlet Biwara. Soemanang had also joined the Indonesian National Party, where he became the chair of its economic department in 1946. He was a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee, and he was later appointed as a representative of the Republic of Indonesia to the Senate of the United States of Indonesia, representing the Republic, in 1950, though the United States of Indonesia was defederalized six months after his appointment and Soemanang became a member of the Provisional People's Representative Council instead. He resigned on 13 March 1954. Soemanang was appointed as the Minister of Economic Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet on April 1952. One of his policies was to return the oil wells in North Sumatra back to the control of Royal Dutch Shell, which faced fierce criticism from the parliament and he withdrew this decision. Additionally, alongside Interior Minister Mohammad Roem, Soemanang ordered the issuance of 50 million identity cards for registry purposes. After his time as minister, Soemanang served as president director in the National Industrial Bank and the Indonesian Development Bank. He also served as an executive director in the International Monetary Fund for some time, representing Indonesia, Algeria, Ghana, Laos, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. In 1979, he returned to the journalistic world, when he founded the short-lived magazines Sari Pers and Zaman in cooperation with the Tempo group. He died in Jakarta on 13 June 1988. His grave is located in Yogyakarta.

I’m thinking in four years there we won a hundred-some games traveling all over the Chicago area.” Kyle Kersey,\\"Coach Jim Rosborough: 41 years and counting\\", Aztec Press Online, November 7, 2019 It was during this time that Rosborough became familiar with the Chicago basketball high school scene which would lead to his first collegiate coaching position at Iowa. Iowa (1974–1983) In the spring on 1974, Iowa hired Lute Olson as head coach. Soon after the hire, Rosborough, a former Iowa Hawkeye but still a teacher and eighth grade coach in Chicago at the time, called Olson to tell him about a prospect. A few weeks later, Olson hired Rosborough to be Iowa's graduate assistant coach. As Olson explained in his 2006 book, \\"What Jim lacked in experience, which was everything, he made up in personality. His willingness to work, his passion for the game, and his knowledge of the Chicago area made him a good fit at Iowa.\\" Recruiting was one of Rosborough's initial responsibilities, as he explained in a 2019 interview, “One of the good things we did at Iowa was to start an Advanced Invitational Camp. I’d comb through the newspapers and see this kid from a high school who’d done well, send him an invite to come to the camp, and we ended up – in the second year we did this – with 28 kids who went to Division I schools.\\" Rosborough would rise to become Olson's top assistant and Iowa's chief recruiter in Chicago, landing key recruits Kenny Arnold and Ronnie Lester who would take Iowa to five straight NCAA tournaments and the Final Four in 1980.Bob Logan, \\"NIU WILL NAME TULSA ASSISTANT AS HEAD COACH\\", Chicago Tribune, April 23, 1986 Rosborough and Olson coached together for nine seasons, from 1974 to 1983, with an overall record of 167–91, before Olson left Iowa to accept the head coaching position at the University of Arizona. On Olson's departure, Rosborough was hired as an assistant to athletic director Bump Elliott and stayed at Iowa for two additional years. Tulsa (1985–1986) For the 1985–86 season, Rosborough was hired as an assistant coach at Tulsa by head coach J. D. Barnett. The team would have a successful season going 23-9, and winning the Missouri Valley Conference championship over Bradley. Barnett would go on to praise Rosborough's strategy in the victory saying, \\"We used different defenses. We put in a match-up Jim Rosborough used at Iowa. He put it in and it worked. We were able to take away their great athletic ability with our defense.\\"\\"Fate, Hurricane Finally Catch Up With Braves\\", The Tulsa World, March 6, 1986 The team would go on to play in the 1986 NCAA tournament and lose to Navy in the first round.  Northern Illinois (1986–1989) Following the success in Tulsa, Rosborough was hired as the head men's basketball coach at Northern Illinois University in April 1986, with a stated goal to build a team that could make the NCAA tournament.Bob Logan, \\"NIU COACH CALMS STORMY DEBUT\\", Chicago Tribune, April 25, 1986 In his three seasons as head coach at NIU, he answered to three different Athletic Directors, an instability that led to Rosborough being fired from the program in 1989.\\"NIU GIVES ROSBOROUGH, STAFF THE BAD NEWS: THEY\`RE FIRED\\", Chicago Tribune, March 9, 1989 Rosborough said in a 2019 interview, “I knew right away when they hired the third AD that it wasn’t a good fit, so that was kind of a struggle year. To be honest with you, when I was let go, I didn’t mind it. I mean I minded it, but I didn’t mind it at all.” Rosborough's freshman recruiting class at NIU would go on reach the NCAA tournament in the 1990-1991 season and win 25 games, the most in school history, solidifying the rebuilding of the program that Rosborough had started. Arizona (1989–2007) Following his departure from NIU, Lute Olson hired Rosborough as an assistant coach at Arizona in April 1989, saying, “The thing with Roz is that he is a premier sideline assistant, as good as any in the business.” The Rosborough and Olson led Arizona Wildcats were a dominant and consistent collegiate basketball team through the 90's and 00's, reaching 18 consecutive NCAA tournaments, eight Pac-10 championships, three NCAA Final Fours, and the 1997 NCAA Championship. Following the 1997 National Championship, Olson promoted Rosborough to Associate Head Coach, the position he would retain until leaving the team in 2007. Rosborough assumed the role of head coach briefly in 2001 following the death of Olson's wife, Bobbi Olson. Rosborough led the team to a 3-1 record in conference play. 1997 NCAA Championship The Arizona Wildcats were an unlikely 1997 National Champion. They entered the 1997 NCAA Tournament with a 19-9 record after finishing in fifth place in the Pac-10. The team did not finish the regular season strongly and went 4-4 in their last eight games. In the first game of the NCAA Tournament, Arizona was in danger of getting upset by South Alabama, who was leading by two points at the half. The Wildcats relied on a perimeter strategy from guards Miles Simon, Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson, and Jason Terry to carry the team. One of the team's unique accomplishments in their improbable run to the 1997 championship was that they were the only team in NCAA Tournament history to beat three No.1 seeds: Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams' nearly undefeated Kansas Jayhawks in the Sweet Sixteen, Hall of Fame coach Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels in the Final Four, and Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino's Kentucky Wildcats in the National Championship. The day after the victory in Indianapolis, the team was given a parade through the streets of Tucson.\\"Arizona Wildcats win 1997 NCAA Championship\\", Arizona Daily Star, April 1, 1997 Rosborough and Olson When Lute Olson was hired at Iowa in the spring of 1974, Jim Rosborough phoned and told him about a Chicago prospect.

Olson would recount the hire in his 2006 book; \\"What Jim lacked in experience, which was everything, he made up in personality. His willingness to work, his passion for the game, and his knowledge of the Chicago area made him a good fit at Iowa.\\" This was the start of a successful coaching relationship and friendship across the next 33 years. Rosborough served under Olson for nine seasons at Iowa, and for 18 seasons at Arizona as an assistant coach, and following the 1997 national championship, as associate head coach. As Arizona's associate head coach, Rosborough's expertise within the Olson basketball system was a driving force that allowed the Arizona program to remain at the highest levels in the country, both on and off the court. The 2006-2007 season would be the final full season at Arizona for both Rosborough and Olson. Following the season, Rosborough rejected an offer to move to a non-coaching position within the athletic department, ending the long partnership with Olson. Due to health concerns, Olson did not coach the following season, and retired in 2008.AP, \\"O'Neill replaces Rosborough on Olson's staff\\", ESPN, May 1, 2007 Pima College (2009–2010) For the 2009-2010 basketball season, Rosborough was hired as the associate head coach of the Pima College men's basketball team.

Arizona women's tennis (2010–2014) Rosborough worked as an assistant coach for the Arizona Wildcats women's tennis team for four seasons with head coach Vicky Maes. Across four seasons, the team qualified for the NCAA tournament three times, and in 2014, had an undefeated 14-0 home record. As Maes explained in a 2011 interview, \\"We were having breakfast one day and the idea (of him coaching) just kind of came about. When Ros joined the staff, the team may have wondered ‘what's a basketball guy going to do for us?' He has really kind of had to earn their trust.\\" Rosborough explained his early interest in tennis in the same 2011 interview, saying, \\"We had a guy in our neighborhood back in Moline who was probably the best tennis player in Moline, and he was in the neighborhood so my parents knew him.

The official vision for the BRI calls for an environmentally friendly \\"Green Belt and Road\\". Policy Chinese policy documents for the BRI coordinate and encourage green finance and investment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment with four other ministries released the \\"Guidance on Promoting a Green Belt and Road\\" in 2017. A section of the policy document covers mobilizing capital for financing green projects using \\"international multilateral and bilateral cooperative institutions and funds, such as Silk Road Fund, South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund, China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund, China-Central and Eastern Europe Investment Cooperation Fund, China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund, Special Fund for Asian Regional Cooperation and LMC Special Fund.\\" Policy institutions like the China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China are to play the \\"guiding role\\". The Development Research Center of the State Council and Export-Import Bank of China released a report in 2019 on green finance for the Belt and Road. The report gives recommendations and draws on lessons for China to develop Belt and Road green finance and goes into the details about \\"implementing the concept of green finance\\" by Export-Import Bank. Forms The various forms of green finance includes investments, lending, and insurance by Chinese state-owned financial entities and companies for renewable energy projects in host countries of the Belt and Road. Bonds The market for green bonds in China is the second largest in the world. In the international bond market, Chinese banks have also issued green bonds. China Development Bank in November 2017 issued the first green bond specifically for Belt and Road projects. This first green BRI bond had EUR and USD tranches of US$1.1 billion for \\"renewable energy, clean transportation and water resource management projects\\" in BRI countries. In the same month, the Bank of China issued a green bond on the London Stock Exchange although not specifically for projects in the BRI. Loans The two primary Chinese policy banks for financing BRI projects are China Development Bank and Export Import Bank and each states support for advancing more green loans. Both banks consider green loans to mean financing projects in renewable energy or environmental protection. The Export Import Bank claimed to fulfill green obligations under the Belt and Road by supporting \\"a large number of projects featuring low energy consumption and high value added in areas of new energy development and utilization and the circular economy.\\" However, out of the energy project loans advanced by both banks between 2014 and 2017 for the BRI, 18% went to coal while solar and wind accounted for 3.4% and 2.9% respectively. Coal projects The primary contradiction with adherence to green finance and BRI projects is the large amount of lending by Chinese banks for coal fired power plants. In contrast, Western financial institutions have limited or prohibited financing of coal fired power plants starting with the World Bank and European Investment Bank in 2013. State owned Chinese commercial banks have shown a willingness to limit coal projects. In 2017, ICBC and China Construction Bank decided to not fund the Carmichael coal mine after environmental protests by the Australian public.

Mission  Members of the Eastern Partnership The main goal of the EuFoA is to strengthen ties between the EU and Armenia. The EuFoA coordinates activities between the European Parliament, civil societies, associations and NGO's, as well as the Armenian diaspora and political organizations across Europe. The EuFoA is committed to raising awareness of the EU in Armenia, promoting Armenian issues to the EU and ensuring the ongoing success of the Eastern Partnership program. The organization occasionally promotes issues relating to Artsakh as well. In February 2018, the organization held an event commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Karabakh movement and encouraged the European Parliament to promote a peaceful resolution on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The EuFoA calls on European parliamentarians to support the self-determination of Artsakh. The EuFoA is a member of the European Movement International and the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum.  Activities   European integration efforts  The EuFoA actively works across the EU and its member states to monitor legislation that has impact on Armenia, while providing support to new initiatives. The organization also publishes various reports and documents on Armenian political issues and organizes conferences and briefings related to EU-Armenia relations. The EuFoA brings forward its initiatives and issues to the EU level. In 2014, the EuFoA held a hearing with other civil societies and the Council of Europe where a motion to support ongoing democratic reforms in Armenia was adopted by members. Armenia and the EU were set to sign an Association Agreement which included a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area in September 2013, however the agreement was called off suddenly by Armenia, following Armenia's decision to join the Eurasian Union. The EuFoA criticized the announcement by former President Serzh Sargsyan to abandon the Association Agreement and stated that the President's decision was not made freely and had been strongly influenced by Russia. In January 2016, the EuFoA participated in the sixteenth meeting of the EU-Armenia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee (PCC) in Strasbourg where members voiced their support to create a new legally binding agreement which would strengthen EU-Armenia relations. Following extensive negotiations, the finalization of the new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Armenia and the European Union was completed and signed in November 2017. The EuFoA supported the new deal and during the signing ceremony, the organizations Director Diogo Pinto stated, “This is a historic day for EU-Armenia relations, marking a fresh start for deepening and strengthening of relations between partners. This modern, ambitious and comprehensive agreement paves the way to a new era of prosperity, partnership and reforms, and European Friends of Armenia stands ready to ensure its success.” The EuFoA also supports visa liberalization for Armenian citizens travelling into the Schengen Area. In November 2017, the EuFoA established an Honorary Council consisting of highly influential European personalities from political, business and cultural spheres, who share EuFoA’s values and ideas and take an active role to serve as ambassadors and advocates for the EuFoA. In addition, the EuFoA cooperates with other organizations, embassies, parliamentary friendship groups and political parties across Europe to plan events including with the Armenian General Benevolent Union, European Armenian Federation for Justice and Democracy, the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly as well as maintaining regular contact with the Government of Armenia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Former Vice President of the National Assembly, Eduard Sharmazanov thanked EuFoA members for their efforts towards the strengthening of European values and the deepening of European integration of Armenia during a meeting. In December 2019, EuFoA celebrated its 10th anniversary. During a reception ceremony in Brussels, William Lavender the Senior Policy and Advocacy Officer of EuFoA stated, \\"At this important moment for Armenia, as relations with the European Union reach a new stage of development, we believe that the work of the European Friends of Armenia is more important than ever. We will keep building bridges for political and civil society actors from Armenia to communicate their perspective to European institutions, as well as to raise awareness about Armenia in Europe.”  Other  During elections in Armenia, the EuFoA conducts and assists in public opinion polls. Prior to the 2012 Armenian parliamentary election, the EuFoA commissioned two independent polls with extensive quality controls. EuFoA also publishes party platforms of the various political parties running in an election. EuFoA also assists and monitors as an observer organization during elections in Artsakh. In November 2015, former Director of EuFoA, Eduardo Lorenzo Ochoa, praised Armenia's efforts to accept Syrian refugees as a result of the Syrian Civil War. The Director stated that, \\"Armenia has the third most war refugees from Syria in Europe. Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, 17,000 Syrians have come to Armenia.\\" In October 2017, the President of Artsakh, Bako Sahakyan visited the EuFoA headquarters. A number of issues were discussed including relations between Artsakh and the EU. The President thanked EuFoA for reinforcing ties between Artaskh and various pan- European structures. The EuFoA organized a conference during the 2019 Global Innovation Forum, in which EuFoA supported Armenia's participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative. The organization also provided logistical support for international journalists to cover the event. Furthermore, during the 2019 World Information Technology and Services Alliance held in Yerevan, the organization promoted Armenia as a technological center to international delegates and attendees. The EuFoA also promotes the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and actively reports on updates and adoptions by various European parliaments.  Locations  The EuFoA headquarters is located in Brussels, Belgium. The organization also maintains a secondary office in Armenia's capital, Yerevan.

It is also one of three species that have leaves covered in dense hairs (together with T.fergusoniae and T.strumosum) Description A small, spreading, mat-forming plant, with the branches rooting and spreading along the ground. A central tuberous taproot remains in the centre of the mat, where the original plant first matured. The leaves are 6–10 mm by 3 mm, and covered entirely in very dense, long hairs. Some of the cells at the leaf-tip are orange in colour. It is therefore without the leaf-tip diadems that are typical for the genus. The flowers are apricot coloured, each petal with a darker purple central stripe. The stamens form a low central cone surrounded by filamentous staminodes. Related species It can sometimes be confused with the other two hairy-leafed species of the genus, T.fergusoniae and T.strumosum.

International Finance Corp., 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2018 term. The Supreme Court ruled that international organizations, such as the World Bank Group's financing arm, the International Finance Corporation, could be sued in US federal courts for conduct arising from their commercial activities. It specifically held that international organizations shared the same sovereign immunity as foreign governments. This was a reversal from existing jurisprudence, which held that international organizations (unlike foreign governments) had near-absolute immunity from lawsuits under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the International Organizations Immunities Act. This case is notable because for the first time the Court established that US-based international organizations, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, could be sued if their overseas investment activities caused harm in local communities. It overturned a decades-old standard established in the aftermath of World War II when newly-formed international agencies were first being established with headquarters in the United States.  Background  The World Bank Group is a group of international organizations that finances infrastructure projects, mostly in developing countries. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), headquartered in Washington, DC is the arm of the World Bank Group that specializes in lending to private sector business interests in developing countries. In the 2000s, the IFC provided $450 million USD to Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd. to fund the construction of the Tata Mundra power plant in Gujarat, a coastal state in western India. As part of the lending agreement (the IFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability), the IFC requires loan recipients, including the power plant, to adhere to stringent human rights safeguards and environmental protections. The agreement allowed the IFC to revoke financial support for the plant if the plant failed to adhere to these requirements. However, the plant, which opened in 2012, emitted pollution which drained into local waterways and farmland, damaging the environment and creating hardship for local fishermen in the Kutch district. An internal audit conducted by the IFC's social responsibility division found that the IFC failed to provide appropriate levels of oversight. Local fishing and farming communities, with the aid of a not-for-profit group called EarthRights International and Stanford Law School, filed suit against the IFC in United States District Court, alleging breach of contract as well as the torts of nuisance and trespass.  In lower courts  Since the IFC's headquarters were in Washington, DC, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2015, relying heavily on the IFC internal audit report as evidence. The IFC successfully moved to dismiss the case, citing absolute sovereign immunity granted to international organizations under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA) in 1945. The IOIA stated in part that international organizations \\"shall enjoy the same immunity from suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign governments\\". In 1945, when the IOIA was enacted, the sovereign immunity enjoyed by foreign governments was nearly absolute. However, starting in the 1950s, the State Department began to adopt a narrower view of foreign sovereign immunity. Under this new interpretation, foreign governments would continue to enjoy nearly absolute immunity for acts conducted in their capacity as national governments. However, they could be sued in federal court for actions taken when acting as private commercial entities. This more- restrictive view of sovereign immunity, including the waiver of immunity for commercial activities, was eventually codified by Congress into the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1972. The IFC successfully argued that international organizations should retain the more expansive version of sovereign immunity that was standard when the IOIA was enacted in 1945, not the more restrictive view that was adopted starting in the 1950s. The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's ruling to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the opinion of the District Court. The plaintiffs finally appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted a writ of certiorari agreeing to hear the case in May 2017. Stanford law professor Jeffrey L. Fisher argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs. Donald Verrilli, the former US Solicitor General (2011-2016), argued the case on behalf of the IFC.  Supreme Court opinion  Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was formerly on the DC Circuit Court which heard the case originally, recused himself and did not participate in the consideration of this case. In a 7–1 decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court reversed the Circuit Court's opinion.Jam v. Int'l Fin. Corp., . According to the Supreme Court, the most natural reading of the IOIA was that Congress intended to permanently tie the sovereign immunity enjoyed by international organizations and the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments. When Congress established the exception for commercial activities in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1972, that exception was 'inherited' by international organizations, who (in the language of the IOIA), \\"enjoy the same immunity from suit […] as foreign governments\\". In his decision, Roberts also noted international organizations may, in their charters, specify that they have absolute immunity from lawsuits and that the International Finance Corporation's charter did not include such a clause. In a dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that Congress's purpose in enacting the IOIA was to confer the same type of immunity to international organizations that foreign governments enjoyed in 1945, when the statute was first enacted. He also encourages a \\"purpose-based\\" interpretation framework for the statute, noting that in 1945 Congress was attempting to create a safe harbor for newly created multilateral organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, and that the founding charters of these organizations required member states to grant them broad immunity from suit. As a result of the Supreme Court's ruling, the case was remanded to the lower courts for further proceedings.

It has been led since its formation in 2009 by musicologist Nino Naneishvili, has performed internationally, and has won national awards for folk and church chant. History The ensemble was founded in 2009 by Nino Naneishvili, initially with the aim of studying and popularizing Georgian sacred chant, in particular the female chant tradition. Their early repertoire drew on archive material from the National Centre of Manuscripts and the Chant Centre of the Georgian Patriarchy, and their second album, Ghmerti Upali and Sunday Hymns, 8 Tones, included part recordings of each hymn, to help other choirs to learn the pieces. They have been pioneering the performance by women of pieces hitherto exclusively performed by male ensembles. Ialoni is part of the revival of Georgia's traditional sacred music, which has been emerging from its repression during Soviet rule. Since 2018, Ialoni has been collaborating with London's Rose Bruford College of Theatre & Performance, and other UK-based choirs, sharing master classes and joint concerts. Etymology The ensemble's name, Ialoni, is a Gurian and Imeretian dialect word meaning first light of day. Awards The ensemble was awarded Best Female Folk Ensemble at the National Folklore Festival of Georgia 2015-2016, organized by the State Center of Folklore of Georgia and the Ministry of Culture and Monument Protection of Georgia.

It is based on the max-product allocation - the allocation maximizing the product of agents' utilities (also known as the Nash-optimal allocation or the Proportionally-Fair solution; in many cases it is equivalent to the competitive equilibrium from equal incomes). It guarantees to each agent at least 0.368 of his/her utility in the max-product allocation. It was designed by Cole, Gkatzelis and Goel.  Setting  There are m resources that are assumed to be homogeneous and divisible. There are n agents, each of whom has a personal function that attributes a numeric value to each \\"bundle\\" (combination of resources). The valuations are assumed to be homogeneous functions. The goal is to decide what \\"bundle\\" to give to each agent, where a bundle may contain a fractional amount of each resource. Crucially, some resources may have to be discarded, i.e., free disposal is assumed. Monetary payments are not allowed.  Algorithm  PAM works in the following way. * Calculate the max-product allocation; denote it by z. * For each agent i: ** Calculate the max-product allocation when i is not present. ** Let fi = (the product of the other agents in z) / (the max-product of the other agents when i is not present). ** Give to agent i a fraction fi of each resource he gets in z.  Properties  PAM has the following properties. * It is a truthful mechanism - each agent's utility is maximized by revealing his/her true valuations. * For each agent i, the utility of i is at least 1/e ≈ 0.368 of his/her utility in the max-product allocation. * When the agents have additive linear valuations, the allocation is envy-free.  PA vs VCG  The PA mechanism, which does not use payments, is analogous to the VCG mechanism, which uses monetary payments. VCG starts by selecting the max-sum allocation, and then for each agent i it calculates the max-sum allocation when i is not present, and pays i the difference (max-sum when i is present)-(max-sum when i is not present). Since the agents are quasilinear, the utility of i is reduced by an additive factor. In contrast, PA does not use monetary payments, and the agents' utilities are reduced by a multiplicative factor, by taking away some of their resources.  Optimality  It is not known whether the fraction of 0.368 is optimal. However, there is provably no truthful mechanism that can guarantee to each agent more than 0.5 of the max-product utility.  Extensions  The PAM has been used as a subroutine in a truthful cardinal mechanism for one-sided matching.

Allan Hobson, M.D. as the memory of subjective awareness during sleep. According to Dr. Hobson, its importance for cognitive science derives from two perspectives. One is the brain basis for consciousness itself and the other is the interpretation of dreams. Knowing the brain basis of consciousness reduces the so-called “hard problem” in a significant way while the provision of an alternative to psychodynamic dream interpretation frees that subject from the controversy in which it has been immersed for more than a century. These twin advances in the science of dreaming are elaborated in Hobson's books and articles from 1977 up to the present. The following is a synopsis of the main points on dream consciousness as explained in his works. The “hard problem” is defined as the difficulty in specifying how subjective awareness could arise from brain activity (Hobson & Friston, 2014). Dream consciousness occurs when the brain is activated during sleep; during REM sleep, that activation is as intense as it is in waking. At the same time, the input-output gates of the brain are actively closed and the chemical balance is shifted from aminergic to cholinergic. The result is an activated, offline, cholinergic brain which, per force rather than perchance, dreams. Waking and dreaming are thus two conscious states whose similarities and differences are now understood (Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Hobson, 1988, 1989, 1994/1999b, 1999a, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2009a, 2009b, 2011, 2012; Hobson & Friston, 2012, 2014). While acknowledging that this still does not resolve the “hard problem” (of consciousness), in that it fails to specify exactly how and why the activated waking and REM sleeping brain becomes conscious, Hobson suggests that one answer is that the “hard problem” is ill-posed in that it makes a dualistic distinction between brain and mind. An alternative theory is that brain and mind are two physical aspects of a unified system, the brain-mind. His discussion of these philosophical issues is summarized in further detail below. According to Hobson, dream interpretation has, until recently, relied on theories of symbolic transformations of mental content and the formal approach described here does not disprove previous schemata. It does, however, supply a more neutral cognitive alternative or constitute a new solution to an age-old problem. In Hobson's view, the content of dream consciousness is the integration of recent experience with prior information. That prior information consists of sensorimotor, emotional, and motivational components — many of which can be specified and measured (cf. esp. Hobson, 2011). In keeping with the view that the offline brain is activated in REM sleep, dreaming may be seen as the brain's effort to reformulate its model of the world so as to be a more effective predictor of its future experience (Hobson & Friston, 2012, 2014). Philosophical considerations Hobson & Friston (2014) write that the “hard problem” can be seen as a residue of Cartesian dualism, which considers brain and mind to be qualitatively distinct entities. As such it is indeed “hard”, if not impossible, to explain how consciousness could arise from brains. Yet there is no similar difficulty seen in the literature when it comes to integrating consciousness components such as perception, memory and emotion. Hence, Hobson argues, consciousness may thus be no more and no less than the simultaneous combination of all of these components (Hobson, 2013). The key move in accepting and advancing this idea is to specify dual aspect monism as the concept best adapted to a new view of the brain-mind has a unified system with two components, one objective (the brain) and one subjective (the mind) (Hobson, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2015). Hobson's theory of the brain in waking, sleeping, and dreaming contends that both the brain and the mind are physical and therefore subject to the same basic rules and regulations as other materials. Being physical, they are necessarily causal one upon the other and the other upon the one. Thus the states of the brain entail the states of the mind and vice versa. While we can imagine (and observe) states of the brain that are not associated with states of the mind, it is not possible to imagine or observe states of the mind that are not associated with states of the brain. For this reason, Hobson argues that a high priority should be accorded to brain science supposing that it will help better understand the mind. This is the principle on which Hobson's brain theory of consciousness and formal approach to dream interpretation is based (Hobson, 2018). References *Hobson, J.A. & McCarley, R.W.

While the term is collective, and is used to refer to a range of different computational methods of analysing literary data, similar approaches also include macroanalysis, cultural analytics, computational formalism, computational literary studies, quantitative literary studies, and algorithmic literary criticism.  History  The term \\"distant reading\\" is generally attributed to Franco Moretti and his 2000 article, Conjectures on World Literature. In the article, Moretti proposed a mode of reading which included works outside of established literary canons, which he variously termed \\"the great unread\\" and, elsewhere, \\"the Slaughterhouse of Literature\\". The innovation it proposed, as far as literary studies was concerned, was that the method employed samples, statistics, paratexts, and other features not often considered within the ambit of literary analysis. Moretti also established a direct opposition to the theory and methods of close reading: \\"One thing for sure: it cannot mean the very close reading of very few texts—secularized theology, really ('canon'!)—that has radiated from the cheerful town of New Haven over the whole field of literary studies\\". However, Moretti initially conceived distant reading for analysis of secondary literature as a roundabout way of getting to know more about primary literature: \\"[literary history] will become 'second- hand': a patchwork of other people's research, without a single direct textual reading\\". Only later did the term distant reading (via Moretti and other scholars) come to become primarily identified with computational analysis of primary literary sources. Despite the consensus about the origins of distant reading at the turn of the twenty-first century, Ted Underwood has traced a longer genealogy of the method, arguing for its elision in current discourse about distant reading. He writes that \\"distant reading has a largely distinct genealogy stretching back many decades before the advent of the internet – a genealogy that is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers\\". Underwood emphasises a social-scientific dimension in this prehistory of distant reading, referring to particular examples in the work of Raymond Williams (from the 1960s) and Janice Radway (from the 1980s). Moretti’s conception of literary evolution in Distant Reading is quite similar to the psychologist Colin Martindale’s (Clockwork Muse, 1990) “scientific,” computational, neo-Darwinist project of literary evolution, and the role of reading is downplayed by both Martindale and Moretti. According to Martindale, the principles of the evolution of art are based on statistic regularities rather than meaning, data or observation. “So far as the engines of history are concerned, meaning does not matter. In principle, one could study the history of a literary tradition without reading any of literature. [...] the main virtue of the computerized content analysis methods I use is that they save one from actually having to read the literature” (p. 14). This variety in the stated definitions and aims of distant reading is characteristic of its development since the turn of the twenty-first century, where it has come to encompass a variety of different methods and approaches, rather than representing a single or unified method of literary study.  Principles and practice  One of the central principles of distant reading is that literary history and literary criticism can be written without necessarily resorting to the kind of careful, sustained reading encounter with individual texts that is fundamental to close reading. Commonly, distant reading is performed at scale, using a large collection of texts. However, some scholars have adopted the principles of distant reading in the analysis of a small number of texts or an individual text. Distant reading often shares with the Annales school a focus on the analysis of long-term histories and trends. Empirical approaches to literary study are a regular characteristic of distant reading, and are often accompanied by a reliance on quantitative methods. Moretti has described the concept of 'operationalizing' as \\"absolutely central to the new field of computational criticism\\" that includes distant reading. This principle, for Moretti, consists of \\"building a bridge from concepts to measurement, and then to the world\\" (104), underscoring the combined interests of empirical and quantitative study at its heart. In practice, distant reading has been undertaken with the aid of computers in the twenty-first century (though Underwood has argued for prominent non-computational precursors); however, some works combining scale and literary study have been described as \\"distant- reading-by-hand\\".  Criticisms of distant reading  Stanley Fish takes a broad view of what he frames as problems of interpretation in the digital humanities, but the specific example he isolates for critique is informed by his impression of distant reading methodology: \\"first you run the numbers, and then you see if they prompt an interpretive hypothesis. The method, if it can be called that, is dictated by the capability of the tool\\". In a similar vein, Stephen Marche focuses on the prospects for interpretation within the framework of computational literary analysis in an article which begins with the provocation, \\"[b]ig data is coming for your books\\". Though he initially described distant reading as the \\"most promising path, at least on the surface\\" of a range of Digital Humanities methods he surveys, he concludes that the generalisations he perceives in the method are ineffective when \\"applied to literary questions proper\\". Additional critiques of distant reading have come from postcolonial theorists. Gayatri Spivak is unconvinced about distant reading's claims to represent the perspectives of the \\"great unread,\\" asking \\"[s]hould our only ambition be to create authoritative totalizing patterns depending on untested statements by small groups of people treated as native informants?\\". Jonathan Arac questions the \\"unavowed imperialism of English\\" in Moretti's work.  Examples  In 'Style, Inc. Reflections on Seven Thousand Titles (British Novels, 1740–1850)' Franco Moretti uses an early distant reading methodology to analyse certain changes in the titles of novels in the given period and country. In the absence of dedicated corpora of these novels' texts, Moretti argues that \\"titles are still the best way to go beyond the 1 percent of novels that make up the canon, and catch a glimpse of the literary field as a whole\\". In the article, Moretti combines the results of quantitative analysis of these titles with contextual knowledge of literary history to address questions about the shortening of eighteenth-century novel titles, about the nature of very short novel titles, and about the relationship of novel titles to genres. For examples, in Section I, he provides evidence of the decreasing length of titles across the time span, and links the phenomenon to the growth of the market for novels and the establishment of periodicals which regularly reviewed novels. In 'Why Literary Time is Measured in Minutes\\" Ted Underwood asks \\" Why are short spans of time so central to our discipline? ... Why is experience measured in seconds or minutes more appropriately literary than experience measured in weeks or months?\\". Methodologically, Underwood supplements theoretical ideas about the compression of fictional time with approaches from distant reading which model the average lengths of time described in 250-word portions of fiction across three centuries. Having also combined quantitative findings with close reading, Underwood concludes his article with a discussion of the integration of quantitative methods into literary study, with the author suggesting that \\"I see close readings and statistical models not as competing epistemologies but as interlocking modes of interpretation that excel at different scales of analysis\\". In their Literary Lab pamphlet, 'A Quantitative Literary History of 2,958 Nineteenth- Century British Novels: The Semantic Cohort Method' Ryan Heuser and Long Le- Khac analyse word usage within their corpus to argue for a \\"systemic concretization of language and fundamental change in the social spaces of the novel\\". Their analysis demonstrates a change in the way in which concrete detail is presented across the span of the nineteenth century, with an observable shift in the novel's narrative style \\"from telling to showing\\" as the century develops. The findings tally with many literary-critical writings about the change in nineteenth-century narrative style from realism to modernism. Lauren F. Klein trains methods from computational linguistics and data visualisation on an archive of slavery, in her article, 'The Image of Absence: Archival Silence, Data Visualization, and James Hemings', in order to present examples of how distant reading can uncover and illuminate \\"the silences endemic to the archive of American slavery\\". Searching for archival traces of James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's enslaved chef, Klein juxtaposes visualisations of his presence with Jefferson's own charts and tables as the basis for a discussion of data visualisation as it relates to the construction of race. The COST Action 'Distant Reading for European Literary History' is a European networking project bringing together scholars interested interested in corpus building, quantitative text analysis, and European literary history. It aims to create a network of researchers jointly developing the distant reading resources and methods necessary to change the way European literary history is written. The objectives of the project include coordinating the creation of a multilingual European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC) containing digital full-texts of novels in different European languages.

The book criticizes the economic performance of the National Democratic Alliance government near the end of its tenure prior to the 2019 Indian general election.  Authors  The book is coauthored by Yashwant Sinha, who served as the Minister of Finance and Minister of External Affairs during the Vajpayee Government, and Aditya Sinha.  Description  The book criticizes the economic performance of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister between the period 2014-2019. The topics covered in the book include the alleged manipulation of the gross domestic product of India, the alleged irregularities in the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and the alleged interference with the independence of Reserve Bank of India. The authors of the book criticise the Make in India programme and consider the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax to be shoddy. The authors of the book say that Narendra Modi missed a golden opportunity to transform the Indian economy, pointing out the large electoral mandate he received. The authors also argue that the previous NDA government led by AB Vajpayee was politically and ideologically different than the present one. While criticizing Modi, Yashwant Sinha says that he has no conflict of interest in writing this book since he has no plans to run for a political office.  Reception  The Hindu describes the book to be \\"neither an economic treatise, nor a political pamphlet\\". It states that the book reveals the lack of democracy within the Bharatiya Janata Party, as exemplified by the hurried compilation of the book.

The strikes targeted Iranian proxy groups, based in Iraq, as well as IRGC operatives. Several Iraqi, Iranian and Israeli officials have blamed Israel for the attacks, though Israel had initially neither confirmed nor denied its role. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted responsibility for the attacks on 20 August 2019, claiming that \\"Iran is not immune anywhere\\". Israel confirmed responsibility for the strikes on 22 August 2019, which was later followed by a US confirmation.  Timeline   Amirli strike  On 19 July 2019 unidentified drones bombed a base belonging to the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces base in Iraq, close to the town of Amirli. An airstrike wounded two Iranians after it struck a base that housed advisers from Iran and Lebanon, while a second strike hit a weapons depot, causing a large fire and the destruction of several ballistic missiles. The US Central Command CENTCOM denied responsibility for the bombing. Iran reported on July 30 that the attack had killed a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abu Alfazl Sarabian.  Camp Ashraf strike  On 27 July 2019 Camp Ashraf, one of the biggest bases in Iraq, was attacked by what Iraqi military sources described as one or more Israeli Air Force jets. The attack struck a consignment of ballistic missile launchers and living quarters of IRGC officers and PMF personnel. Some sources reported that up to 40 people were killed in the attack. According to Iraqi and Iranian sources the attacks were carried out by Israeli F-35 aircraft.  Southern Baghdad strike  Explosions rocked a PMF weapons depot in southern Baghdad on 12 August killing one and injuring 29 civilians. A spokesman for Iraq's Interior Minister said that an examination of the warehouse showed that the explosion was not caused by an internal failure but by a third party that attacked the warehouse and caused a fire. Iraq closed its airspace to all unauthorized flights on 13 August, including to the US coalition. Iraqi Prime Minister also ordered all military camps and munitions warehouses to be moved outside Iraqi cities following the explosions that killed one civilian and wounded 29.  30th Brigade's headquarters strike  On 17 August, unidentified warplanes targeted the 30th Brigade's headquarters, which is affiliated with the Popular Mobilization Forces.  Balad strike  Blasts hit a PMF arms depot on 20 August close to the Balad Air Base. A PMF source said the arms depot was specifically targeted by an aerial bombardment.  Al-Qa'im  On 25 August 2019 a PMF convoy was hit by two drones near the Syrian–Iraqi border town of Al-Qa'im, killing six, including a senior commander. PMF blamed Israel for the attack. It came as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was making a speech in response to an alleged Israeli attack at their stronghold in Dahieh, Lebanon.  Hit strike  On 20 September, loud explosions were reported at a warehouse near the city of Hit in Anbar Province, northwest of Baghdad. Sky News Arabic reported that after the blast, shells were launched into neighboring areas, indicating an arms depot may have been hit. Al-Arabiya also reported that the warehouse was used to store weaponry and belonged to the Popular Mobilization Forces. al-Arabiya quoted an Iraqi officer claiming there was a drone in the area at the time of the explosions. As result of the explosions, 21 Iraqi militants of the Popular Mobilization Forces were killed.  Tafuf Brigade strike  On 22 September, violent explosions caused by airstrikes took place at a base belonging to \\"Liwa al-Tafuf\\" 13th Brigade of the Popular Mobilisation Units. An Iraqi security official told The New Arab that drones may have been used in the attack.  Responsibility  On 22 August 2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel had been carrying out operations against Iran in Iraq, saying \\"We are working against Iranian consolidation—in Iraq as well.\\" US officials also confirmed that Israel was behind the attacks later in the day.

After serving as leader of the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra from 1951, in 1954 she joined the Royal Danish Orchestra. Together with other musicians from the orchestra, in 1957 she created the Copenhagen String Quartet (Københavns Strygekvartet) until it ceased playing in 1994. In 1969, she left the orchestra to turn to teaching. In the early 1970s, she joined Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium where she became Denmark's first female professor of music in 1988. Early life and education Born in Copenhagen on 30 April 1930, Tutter Ellen Margrethe Givskov was the daughter of the inspector Frederik Givskov (1897–1984) and Ellen Caroline Blumensen (1906–1962). She started to play the violin when she was six, becoming the leader of her school orchestra and then of the junior ensemble of the Danmark Radio's Symphony Orchestra under Emil Reesen. She entered the Royal Danish Academy of Music when she was 14, studying the violin under and , graduating in 1947. She also studied the piano, allowing her later to accompany her students. She then spent two winter seasons in London, studying further under Henry Holst. Career In 1951, she became the leader of the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra, often playing popular violin concertos. She joined the Royal Symphony Orchestra in 1954, becoming the first woman to serve on the orchestra's board in 1957–58. In 1957, she established the Copenhagen String Quartet, one of the leading quartets of the times. It consisted of musicians from the Royal Orchestra, including Givskov as first violin, Mogens Lüdolph, second violin, Mogens Bruun, viola, and Asger Lund Christiansen, cellist. They built up a repertoire of 122 quartets which they were able to play at short notice, often performing abroad. Givskov became so active in the quartet that she left the Royal Orchestra in 1969. In 1971, she began to teach at Jyske Musikkonservatorium, becoming the first woman to be appointed full professor of music in 1988. She retired in 1999.

The conflict is centered around mining disputes between the Maduro regime, the Pemon nation, and armed irregular groups. The Pemon nation is artificially divided by th border between Venezuela and Brazil, resulting in Pemon refugees regularly crossing the border into Brazil for safety and medical care. Much of Venezuela's indigenous land is located inside the Orinoco Mining Arc, a 112,000 sq km area of the Amazon Rainforest rich in gold, diamonds, coltan, and uranium. The vast wealth located in the Mining Arc makes indigenous lands prime real estate for both state-sanctioned and illegal mining operations, at the cost of widespread ecological damage and displacement of indigenous peoples living in conflict zones. A series of turf wars in the Gran Sabana between the armed forces, guerrillas, and organized crime groups, combined with the power struggle between Nicolás Maduro and Juan Guaidó, created the ongoing conflict.  Background  Violence and mining activity In its 2018 report, the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (OVV) classifies the Bolívar state as the third state with the highest homicide rate, out of 23 states and after Aragua and Miranda. One of the two factors that the OVV attributed the homicide rate was the mining activity of the municipalities that had the highest rates in the country: El Callao, Roscio (Guasipati) and Sifontes (Tumeremo). The OVV explains that in this zone different forms of violence and crime concentrate, including the zones control by organized crime and kingpins, the violent response of military forces in the zone and the recent presence of different guerilla groups. Besides the criminal activity of the armed irregular groups, there is also activite by security forces such as the FAES, with actions and operations that violate human rights, demonstrated by the lack of rule of law in the territory. Lastly the \\"privatization of violence\\", since the functions of the state are \\"being assumed in an arbitrary and private way by whichever of the armed groups that operate in the area. According to Monitor de Vìctimas (Victims' Monitor), as of 2018 107 were killed in twelve massacres in Bolívar since 2016.  Tumeremo massacres  On March 2016, 28 miners were murdered and kidnapped in the town of Tumeremo, Bolívar state. On the night of 4 March 2016, they were in the Atenas mine, on the border between the municipalities of Sifontes and Roscio, a poor area where, like most of the southeast of the country, the main economic activity is mining. According to anonymous witnesses, the Banda del Topo (\\"Mole gang\\") arrived at the mine, allegedly with the aid and complicity of unidentified security forces, and may have dispersed hundreds of miners with an ambush, with dozens falling and dying in the stampede. The bodies were allegedly put in a truck and moved across the Guayana Esequiba border. Some said that parts of the victims were dismembered to intimidate the survivors. The Prosecutor General, Luisa Ortega Díaz, said that the remains of at least four of the disappeared miners were later found in the middle of the country and seemed to have been shot, but that they had no identification.\\"Hallaron restos de mineros desaparecidos en Venezuela\\", artículo del 14 de marzo de 2016 en el sitio web Cadena3.\\"Hallan restos de 28 mineros desaparecidos en Venezuela\\", artículo del 14 de marzo de 2016 en el diario La Voz de Galicia (España). Ortega Díaz reported late on the night of 14 March 2016 that the search efforts for the disappeared miners had concluded with the discovery of 17 bodies total. Tarek William Saab, the Ombudsman, subsequently announced on 15 March 2016 that the remains of 17 miners found in a mass grave in Tumeremo were wounded by firearms. The National Assembly created a Special Commission to investigate the events. Between 14 and 16 October 2018, 16 miners at Los Candados mine were killd and 6 wounded in at least the third civilian massacre in Tumeremo since 2016. An opposition deputy for the state, , confirmed that the recovered bodies were of four men and three women. He also posted a thread of tweets showing several bodies, including those with gunshot wounds showing how they had been killed and abandoned. As high as sixteen people were murdered, and six people were reported injured. Five survivors of the attack returned to their village to report the events. The National Liberation Army (ELN) was suspected of committing the massacre. Shortly after the events, towards the end of October, armed violence broke out in Tumeremo, which de Grazia says began with the presence of government military forces.  Pemon conflict   2018  According to the San Antonio de Roscio indigenous community captain, Ana Mercedes Figueroa, the tribe has had to organize since 2015 to resist against the threats of mining groups and \\"syndicates\\" directed by pranes (gang leaders) that not only try to control several mines, but also expel them from their territory, where gold exploitation makes harder the survival of the tribe. Since early 2018, the community started to protest against harsh life conditions, the murder of leaders allegedly committed by the Colombian National Liberation Army and the permanent harassment by organized crime groups that seek to control large territories where there is illegal mining and reportedly have direct relationships with state officials. On 8 October 2018, members of the Pemon indigenous community blocked, in the kilometer 67, the access to the road to Santa Elena de Uairén and to Brazil, the only road that connects Puerto Ordaz with the Venezuelan-Brazilian border, to protest against high food costs, lack of medicines to deal with diseases such as malaria, and the harassment of local gangs, as well as high transport prices, lack of fuel and domestic gas and speculation of the medical supplies prices. After eight days of protest, Santa Elena de Uairén still lacked food, fuel and gas that was demanded by the demonstrators that closed the access. Opposition deputy Américo de Gracia declared that the indigenous people were victims of the indifference of the authorities. After President Nicolás Maduro assured in a press conference on 12 December 2018 that there were armed groups that infiltrated in some indigenous communities in the area bordering with Brazil, that the illegal mining in the south of the country is in the hands of \\"ecocidal mafias\\", blaming the political opposition for the violence in the zone, and denounced that the \\"indigenous people\\" who join them \\"destroy their community\\", Pemon people responded publishing a video on social media: The Pemon also declared that candidate Andrés Velásquez won the 2017 regional elections in the Bolívar state, but that the executive branch imposed their candidate Justo Noguera, which the qualified as a crime. The video concluded saying \\"go away Nicolás, because you are Colombian\\". On 8 December, Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence officials arrived on the morning to the Campo Carrao sector, in the Canaima National Park. According to the locals, their purpose was to carry out a raid, but they ended up in the mines of the zone, something frequent also according to the locals, where they injured two Pemons of the Arekuna community. Another person was shot and killed by Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence officials, who were wearing plainclothes at the moment. Journalist Germán Dam denounced that the perpetrators moved in helicopters used by Corpoelec, the state owned electricity corporation. As a response to the attack, the indigenous community detained, desarmed and beat up the two perpetrators of the raid, while they also closed the runway near the town.  2019  Venezuelan alt= Humanitarian aid was stockpiled on the Brazilian border, with the intent to bring it into Venezuela. On 20 February, Dragoon 300 armoured fighting vehicles of the Armored Cavalry Squadron were seen entering the Gran Sabana region. Groups of indigenous Pemon peoples blocked the entry of the military vehicles into the region, and members of armed forces loyal to Maduro fired upon them with live ammunition on 22 February. Fifteen Pemon were injured, four seriously, and two Pemon were killed. The injured were transferred to Brazil due to the shortage of medical supplies in the Venezuelan hospital of Santa Elena de Uairén. Following the crackdown, indigenous groups detained thirty-six soldiers, held them in the jungle and set fire to a military outpost of the Santa Elena de Uairén airport. Deputy , denounced the lack of medicine and ambulances to transport the wounded. Near the Brazil–Venezuela border, more than 2,000 indigenous people from Gran Sabana gathered to assist with the entrance of international aid. Venezuelan authorities issued a capture order of the mayor of Gran Sabana and of the Pemon chieftains, accusing them of rebellion. The Venezuelan National Guard repressed demonstrations near Brazil, while colectivos attacked protesters in San Antonio del Táchira and Ureña, leaving at least four dead and about 20 injured. A Venezuelan army post near Santa Elena de Uairén was attacked with molotov cocktails and stones. Aid trucks destined to travel from Brazil into Venezuela did not enter Venezuela and returned to their departure points. The Brazilian Army reported that Venezuelan authorities fired live ammunition at those attempting to accept aid and that tear gas from Venezuela was fired into the Brazilian border city of Pacaraima. Former governor Andrés Velásquez declared that fourteen people were killed and that many of them had gunshots wounds in their heads, indicating involvement of snipers. He further explained that \\"many have died due to lack of attention because the Santa Elena hospital did not have blood, saline solution, reactives nor oxygen, or operating rooms to intervene the patients\\", that the people died bleeding and the hospital personnel could not do anything to help them. Two ambulances carrying dead and wounded crossed the Brazil–Venezuela border and took them to the Roraima General Hospital, in Boa Vista, where medic records documented that everyone had gunshots wounds. US senator Marco Rubio declared that Cuban agents directed repression in Ureña. On February 22 the armed forces had committed the massacre in Kumarakapay, but they failed to retake the airport from the native rebels, and they also lost the land border crossing to the Pemons. The Maduro regime activated a plan they had on reserve to utilize convicts during military emergencies. Minister of Prisons Iris Varela had previously requested, and was granted, 30,000 rifles to arm convicts. Varela boasted, \\"If they threaten us with 5,000 Marines, we have 45,000 prisoners.\\" Under Varela's instructions, the 'pranes' (prison gang leaders) of El Dorado and Vista Hermosa prisons in Bolivar State were called to active service. A video secretly recorded by a Venezuelan soldier shows a group of convicts in their yellow jumpsuits standing in formation, flanked by uniformed soldiers and national militiamen while hearing a political commissar speak about fighting to defend everything that Hugo Chavez fought to achieve. On February 23 approximately 3,000 convicts were put in military uniform, armed, and put on a convoy of school buses that traveled to the Gran Sebana, where the troops were unleashed on the rebellious Pemons. This attack broke most Pemon resistance and their only remaining stronghold was the airport. The next day, on February 24, colectivos arrived in Gran Sabana Municipality looking to arrest the mayor, who had recognized Juan Gauido as Interim President. They didn't find him, but as the only indigenous mayor in Venezuela, he was stripped of his post, hich was assigned to someone loyal to the Maduro regime. Then on February 27, the National Guard successfully recaptured the airport and arrested four indigenous leaders of the uprising. By the end of the conflict, National Assemblyman Romel Guzamana, a chieftain of the Pemon community in Gran Sabana, stated that at least 25 Pemon were killed in what NTN24 described as a \\"massacre\\" by Venezuelan troops. The National Assembly added that 80 Pemons had disappeared since the massacre, in addition to the deth toll claimed by Guzamana. On 22 November, at least nine people were killed in a mine in Ikabarú, in Bolívar, including a teenager, a Pemon and a National Guardsman. On 10 December, a group of around forty Russian soldiers arrived to Canaima, Bolívar, on a Shaanxi Y-8 plane landing on the runway that serves as the entry to the National Park. Locals assured that the soldiers wore uniforms of the Venezuelan Armed Forces and that they carried crates with microwave equipment, satellite antennas, signal inhibitors, and other devices. In the dawn of 22 December, a group of around twelve regular soldiers and 30 indigenous reservists led by an Army deserter officer, captured the facilities of the 513 Mariano Montilla Jungle Infantry Battalion, located in the Luepa sector, in the Gran Sabana municipality. According to police information, after the assault to the battalion, the police received a call at around 4:58 am VST from officer Franco Efrain to notify that heavily armed individuals, feigning to be Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence officials, aimed at every active official, stripped them of their ordnance weapons (five pistols) and took a bulletproof vest. Journalist Román Camacho reported that according to police sources, ammunition and 112 rifles were obtained during the raid. The rebel military and Pemons later attacked a police station in , where they seized nine 9 mm pistols and five shotguns. While they were escaping, they found a military checkpoint, where a shootout started, and they ran to the trails. Government forces pursued and engaged again, when former National Guardsman Darwin Malaguera Ruiz was injured and detained. A soldier was killed during the shootout, and the government forces recovered 82 AK-103 rifles, 60 grenades and six 7.76 ammunition boxes.

History In 1889, German physiologist Max Verworn applied a low- level direct current to a mixture of bacterial species and observed that some moved toward the anode and others moved to the cathode. Just two years later, in 1891, Belgian microscopist E. Dineur made the first known report of vertebrate cells migrating directionally in a direct current, a phenomenon which he coined galvanotaxis. Dineur used a zinc–copper cell to apply a constant current to the abdominal cavity of a frog via a pair of platinum electrodes. He found that inflammatory leukocytes aggregated at the negative electrode. Since these pioneering studies, a variety of different cell types and organisms have been shown to respond to electric fields.

His case caused discussions about dealing with organized crime by large clan-structures in Germany. Life The Miri-Clan consists of about 35 extended families who arrived in Germany in the 1980s as refugees from Lebanon. The whole clan is said to have 3.600 members in Germany. The criminal gangs, connected by the clan are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery, arms trafficking, assault, extortion, fraud, money laundering, murder, kidnapping and prostitution.

The mother of the babies, 35-year-old Kaisa Emilia Vornanen-Karaduman, had concealed the pregnancies and abandoned them, after giving birth at home. The Rovaniemi Court of Appeal sentenced her to 13 years imprisonment for five counts of manslaughter, but not for concealing a corpse. According to District Prosecutor Sari Kemppainen, who was the lead prosecutor for the case, there have been no similar cases in Finnish criminal history.  Discovery  On June 3, 2014, Oulu police received a complaint about some foul-smelling packages found in the basement of an apartment block in the center. When examined, the packages were found to contain the bodies of five infants. The 35-year-old mother of these children, Kaisa Emilia Vornanen-Karaduman (b. 1979), was arrested and detained on suspicion of manslaughter and concealment of a corpse. During interrogation, the charges were increased to five homicides. The woman claimed that she had given birth at home, and preserved the bodies after death. She could not explain the motive for her actions, and denied deliberately killing them. The preliminary investigation determined that the children were born in the years 2005, 2007, at the turn of the year 2011-2012, 2012 and 2013. They were born in apartments on Rommakkokatu and Peltokatu streets. The causes of death could not be determined, because the bodies had been severely degraded by then. According to the prosecutor later at trial, Vornanen-Karaduman had usually given birth in the bathroom or toilet, wrapped the babies up in plastic bags, put them in a bucket, closed it and then took it to the basement. In two instances, she claimed to have used a steam bath and a shoe box instead of the bucket. According to the prosecutor, the woman had left the children without any care or assistance after they were born. During the examinations, 28 people were interviewed as witnesses, including relatives, colleagues and acquaintances. Vornanen-Karaduman had hidden her pregnancies from the others, with loose clothing. Her relatives knew about one pregnancy, that the woman claimed had ended in a miscarriage. A former boss of Vornanen-Karaduman suspected that she was pregnant at one time, but she had explained to her manager that her stomach was rounded as a result of all the greasy pizzas that she had eaten the previous night. Vornanen- Karadumanen's father described his daughter as a pathological liar. Vornanen- Karaduman's lawyer stated in his final statement in the district court hearing that his client was pregnant, yet again, during the summer of 2014, when she was arrested by police. This pregnancy, however, was terminated at her own request.  Trial and imprisonment  The Oulu District Court handled the case in a matter of four days in December 2014. Vornanen-Karaduman was charged with five murders and five counts of concealing a corpse. She denied all charges, and insisted on her innocence. However, if found guilty, she claimed that it would at most be negligent homicide or aggravated death. Vornanen-Karaduman said that for every baby she gave birth to, she felt lifeless, because they did not move or cry. According to her, it was only later did she learn that the babies had been alive. The district court found that Vornanen-Karaduman acted deliberately in the deaths of her babies, and she was ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment. The results were revealed on June 1, 2015, and Vornanen-Karaduman was concluded to be criminally responsible for the acts, though she suffered from a mixed personality disorder. On June 15, the District Court sentenced Kaisa Vornanen-Karaduman to life imprisonment for five murders and five counts of concealing a corpse. According to the law, the repetition of the acts almost identically, in five separate instances, showed that the acts had been planned out. In June 2016, the Rovaniemi Court of Appeal reduced Vornanen-Karaduman's sentence to 13 years imprisonment for five counts of manslaughter.

It later joined the ICSID on October 14, 1966, and the MIGA on June 10th, 1992. Uganda also holds the chair for the 22 nation Africa Group 1 Constituency, headed by Anne Kabagambe. Uganda holds 0.07% of the vote in the IBRD while its constituency holds 1.92%. In the IFC, Uganda holds 0.05% of the vote while its constituency holds 1.31%. Uganda in the IDA holds 0.18% of the vote, while the Africa Group 1 Constituency commands 4%. In the MIGA, meanwhile, Uganda has 0.21% while its constituency holds 3.54% of the vote. Uganda’s economy has recently experienced a slight rebound after a five year slow down, giving rise to a feeling of optimism. However, economic growth remains heavily intertwined with agriculture and natural events, as well as favorable trade conditions going forward. Regional instability among Uganda’s top trading partners combined with a 1.2 million refugee population has also placed strains on Uganda’s economy. Additionally, despite passing its Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty, preventing those who have escaped poverty from sliding back in has proven difficult. The main World Bank projects are involved in infrastructure and education in order reduce poverty in the country, with eleven projects currently underway.  Development Emphasis - Infrastructure and Education  World Bank initiatives have been focused on reducing poverty through infrastructure development and education. This has included road development, internet accessibility, water management, and nutrition and business education. Education in particular is important, since the average years of education for a Ugandan at age 18 are 7 years, yet regionally it is 8.1. Furthermore, the actual amount learned during these years is questionable and is reduced to 4.5 years of “actual” learning. The Ugandan budget for education is also much lower than others in its region at only 2.6% of GDP.  Infrastructure Development  Infrastructure development is a major part of World Bank aid to Uganda and generally involve urbanizing and transportation objectives. One such project is the Uganda Support for Municipal Development Project (USMID), which is a USD$150 million IDA led project that began in 2013 with potential plans to expand since 2018. The project was conceived in order to facilitate urban infrastructure development by lending money for the development of fourteen municipalities, where each of these municipalities has considerable autonomy in choosing what kinds of infrastructure programs best suit them. The project is also part of Programs-for-Results, which seeks to deliver aid based on improvement results. On April 19, 2018, the IDA proposed increasing the amount by an additional USD$335 million with the intention of increasing the geographical range of the program to eight more municipalities while increasing the depth of the program in existing ones. It is also designed to help alleviate problems associated with refugee influxes and rapid urbanization in Uganda. Other examples of large infrastructure development projects include the North Eastern Road- Corridor Asset Management Project (NERAMP), which is designed to increase the efficiency, oversight and quality of road building in the north. There is also the Water Development program which is supposed to help integrate water planning and sanitation services.  Education Development  Education in Uganda remains a pressing concern for development goals. Education is currently characterized by teacher and student absenteeism, lack of resources, as well as low government spending. According to the UN, Uganda is also home to the third largest refugee population in the world, adding additional stress to its economy and increasing demand for education. Several World Bank projects are designed to help with this, including the Uganda Multi-Sectoral Food Security and Nutrition Project and the Uganda Skills Development Project.

Her daughter Elena Makarova is also a well-known writer. Biography Inna Lisnyanskaya was born in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, at that time a republic inside the USSR, in 1928. Her father was of Jewish ethnicity, and mother — of Armenian. Her Armenian grandmother baptized her in Armenian Orthodoxy when she was a child. Inna Lisnyanskaya grew up in Baku, in a house where three languages were present: Yiddish, Russian and Armenian. In 2000, she said to Maxim D. Shrayer of Boston College, US, editor of Jewish-Russian anthology, that in 1944, when it became known about the Holocaust, she officially claimed that she was of Jewish ethnicity, to protest the fascist murder of Jewish people; she believed in Jesus Christ as well and wrote about the Jewish culture in her poetry. When Inna was a 5 grade class pupil, she worked as an aide in an Azerbaijani Military Hospital during the last period of World War 2 where Soviet soldiers with facial wounds were treated. Later she wrote a sonnet In Hospital of Facial Wound. Inna Lisyanskaya spent a year in Baku State University, then dropped out. She began writing some poetry, as well as translations from Azerbaijani to Russian in 1948. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1957 in Baku. She drove to Moscow in 1960. Once, Inna Lisyanskaya was, in early 1960s, listening to Semyon Lipkin reading his poetry about World War 2 in Moscow Central Writers' House, later they met in 1967 and married. Semyon Lipkin was a poet and translator. Resignation from Soviet Writer's Union Russian almanac Metropole, published abroad, rearranged a collection of young Soviet poets in 1979 to publish, but all writers in Soviet Union must first take permission in Communist government for every publication. The Communist government hadn't allowed them to do this, but Metropole was anyway published in US, and as a result two Soviet young writers, Viktor Yerofeyev and Evgeniy Popov, were expelled from the Soviet Writer's Union. Inna Lisnyanskaya, Semyon Lipkin and writer Vasily Aksyonov (Aksyonov was more known and published in USSR, but Lipkin was elder in their group, born 1913) decided to support the young writers and left the Soviet Writer's Union in sympathy with the young poets. The leaving of the Soviet Writer's Union resulted in the poets being banned from publishing anything anymore in the Soviet Union, and banned from travelling abroad. The American writer Ronald Meyer secretly sent their poetry over diplomatic dispatches abroad. Inna Lisnyanskaya said in an interview in 1990, that the prohibitions were even good for her poetic work, because she ceased to be forced to censor herself for Soviet publications, because she was not anymore writing for the Soviet Union, but only for close friends. But the Communist government continued to pressure her also to cease all her foreign publications, so Lisnyanskaya was partly forced to stop from publishing some of her poetry abroad. 1987 All restrictions were lifted in 1987 and her poetry was published in many Soviet magazines. She became a major Soviet poet, her first Russian book of poetry, Poems, was printed in 1991, and she was awarded with the Solzhenitsyn Prize and Russia's Poet Prize. Without You A collection of her poetry Without You was dedicated to her friend, co-worker, and husband, Semyon Lipkin, when Galina Lisnyanskaya lost him in 2004. American writer Ronald Meyer, who often visited her in the village of Peredelkino and became friends, said the book was a talented, remarkable work. Russian PEN Inna Lisnyanskaya was also one of the organizers of the Russian Pen Center. Without Semyon Lipkin Inna Lisnyanskaya died in 2014 in Haifa, Israel. Poetry Joseph Brodsky, a Russian poet, Nobel laureate, said once in an interview for the magazine 'Russian Thought' that he was significantly touched by poetry written by Inna Lisnyanskaya and Semyon Lipkin. Inna Lisnyanskaya's poetry was once called by poet Elaine Feinstein as an echo of tradition of Anna Akhmatova's great poetry and a transcendence of particular language: \\\\---- Naked thoughts live unembellished. That saying's a lie, you can't Twice and so forth, whatever it is. A thousandth time I enter the same river. And I see the same grey stone on the bottom, The same carp with its gristly fins ... \\\\---- ('Naked thoughts live unembellished' from Far from Sodom, book of poetry translated by Daniel Weissbort) A collection of Inna Lisnyanskaya's poetry was translated from Russian in English language by Daniel Weissbort (see Far from Sodom; Arc Publications, 2005) as well as by Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams (see Headwaters; Perpetua Press, 2008).

He is remembered today mainly for his set of 24 Preludes, Op. 2, for piano. He was born in Tashkent, Russian Empire (in present-day Uzbekistan). He moved with his family to Leningrad in 1926. In 1933 entered the Leningrad Conservatory, initially as a piano student, working with Nikolayev. His harmony teacher, V. V. Pushkov, persuaded him to take up composing seriously, and he obtained a double degree in piano (graduated 1938) and composition (graduated 1940). Russian involvement in World War II commenced in 1941. Goltz volunteered for the Army, but was instead assigned to the Political Administration of the Baltic Fleet, to compose patriotic songs. Several of his songs, such as Shining Star in the Heavens, The Song of Anger and The Song of Vengeance, became very popular during the war. He worked in inhuman conditions during the Siege of Leningrad, and died six months after the start of the Siege, of illness caused by malnutrition.

Career  Cath Jackson started her career in the early 1980s as a cub journalist on International Construction Magazine and later transitioned to be a freelance cartoonist. Her artistic focus, as a lesbian cartoonist, was largely centered around political activism and questioning feminist positions. Jackson began producing comic strips in 1981 for magazines such as Nursing Times and City Limits. The New Statesman, a British newspaper, also displayed her work on their July cover in 1985. The New Statesman magazine is well known for its upfront and confrontational outlook on global politics. In addition, she drew cartoons for an aids instructional pamphlet targeted at women and produced by the Terrance Higgins Trust Foundation. Her contribution to Trouble and Strife began in the Spring of 1984 and she regularly helped produce the magazine until the Summer of 1993. Trouble and Strife generated articles that advocated for \\"radical feminism\\" from 1983–2002. Jackson returned in 2014 to illustrate for the magazine on the topic of anti-gay legislation at the Sochi Olympics. Some of her cartoons from these publications were later reproduced on post cards for Cath Tate Cards.

If it can be developed into a human-compatible form it would be the first to come from an animal microbiome.  History  The compound was discovered in Photorhabdus bacteria in 2019, living in the digestive systems of entomopathogenic nematodes. Researchers identified the nematode as a possible host because they feed on insects by targeting their larvae and releasing bacteria that then confront pathogens similar to those found in humans. In experiments, it cured mice of infections with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, both members of the Enterobacteriaceae, without toxic side effects.  Gram-negative bacteria  Gram-negative bacteria have a characteristic architecture for the cell envelope, with an inner membrane, an outer membrane, and a periplasmic space in between. In this arrangement, the peptidoglycan layer is relatively thin and does not retain the crystal violet stain used in the Gram staining method of bacterial classification. Antibiotic resistance has become wide-spread in bacterial pathogens, and in Gram-negative bacteria such as the Enterobacteriaceae, much of this comes from acquired genes. The resistance genes encode proteins that export or inactivate β-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, etc. Plasmids carrying these genes readily move between strains or between species. Consequently, resistance to the currently available panel of approved antibiotics is an increasingly worrisome problem. The most recent class of antibiotics effective against these bacteria emerged in the 1960s.  Mode of action  Darobactin inhibits BamA and disrupts the proper formation of the Gram-negative cell envelope. BamA is a central component of the BamABCDE complex, which inserts proteins from the periplasm into the outer membrane. BamA also aids in the folding of outer membrane-bound proteins. Thus, darobactin prevents the proper formation of the outer membrane of bacteria, leading to cell death. Because only Gram-negative bacteria have BamA and outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, only they are susceptible to darobactin.  Biosynthesis  Darobactin is a RiPP, that is, a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide. Its production and export is encoded by a typically silent five gene operon that showed minimal production under laboratory culture conditions. Mature darobactin consists of a seven amino acids core peptide derived from a longer precursor, with unusual Trp-1 to Trp-3 and Trp-3 to Lys-5 (or Arg-5, in variant forms) crosslinks. The key enzyme for maturation from the precursor to the mature form is the radical SAM/SPASM enzyme DarE.

Publication history In 1994, Dream Pod 9 published the science fiction role-playing game Heavy Gear. After publishing several supplements dealing with advanced weaponry and geographical information about the Terra Nova setting, they released Crisis of Faith in 1997, a 8\\" x 5\\" 112-page softcover book that was the first in a series to reveal the events on Terra Nova leading up to the current Heavy Gear storyline. The history is presented as a series of conversations, government memos, excerpts from personal diaries and news stories. Reception The reviewer from Pyramid #30 (March/April, 1998) stated that \\"Crisis of Faith advances the Heavy Gear timeline with excerpts of source material and snippets of fiction detailing or hinting at great changes on Terra Nova, the colony world that Heavy Gear is set on. The format of the book is very pleasing to the eye and easy to read, and complemented with excellent illustrations.\\" In the May 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue #247), Chris Pramas thought the small size of the book might make it less visible on store shelves, and the high price ($20 in 1998) was potentially off-putting, but he found the production values and interior art excellent, saying, \\"One look inside, however, is enough to ensure that you won‘t put it down. Thirty-two of the pages are full color, and the whole thing is up to DP9’s usual excellent level of graphic design.\\" He also noted that \\"While there are no game statistics of any kind, the book is a gold mine of scenario ideas.\\" Pramas did find the contents relatively \\"inaccessible\\" to new players, who might have trouble following along with the notable people, the Terra Nova setting and events. But he concluded by giving the book an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"Crisis of Faith... is lovingly crafted and tells a compelling story. Those who have longed for more information on the world of Terra Nova should pick this up, despite the hefty price....

He is most credited for devoting his life for the survival of the East Kolkata Wetlands, naming it, and creating the world's only fully functioning organic sewage management system.  Early life  He attended the University of Calcutta in West Bengal, India, and was the first engineer of the university to graduate with a PhD in ecology. He went on to become a sanitation engineer for the West Bengal government, which brought the issues of the Kolkata Wetlands to his sites.  Work  Advocating nature-based solutions, Dhrubajyoti Ghosh's work in the East Kolkata showed it could be used for free- of-charge sewage work, fertile aquatic gardens and fisheries, and flood defenses with minimal harm to the environment. Using his position in RAMSAR, he secured the protection of the wetlands under the RAMSAR convention. This land soon became the world's only fully functional organic sewage management system, treating 750 million litres/day, using solar UV radiation to purify canals leading into the wetlands. The wetlands are now under threat by developers, which Dhrubajyoti Ghosh constantly resisted during his life. His main complaint on the upkeep of this project is that there is no large scale management or municipal ownership of the system to keep quality control, and there is currently no known governmental plans to change that. His work included being Chief of the Department of Environment of the Government of West Bengal, member of the Board of Trustees of the India Worldwide Fund for Nature, fellow of the National Institute of Science within the Government of India, member to the management board of RAMSAR, and a member of the National Wetland Committee.

Enrique Iturriaga Romero (April 3, 1918 – November 23, 2019) was a Peruvian composer and educational theorist.  Biography  Enrique Iturriaga Romero was born in Lima, Peru, in 1918 and spent most of his childhood in Huacho, a small port city north of the Peruvian capital. As a child, Iturriaga did not receive any formal musical training, but music was always present in the Iturriaga family house. His grandmother and older cousins often played the piano during family gatherings, arousing Enrique's interest in music from an early age, and was also encouraged by his father to play the piano. The young Iturriaga was naturally involved in music and enjoyed improvising on the piano; He also learned to play popular music like Peruvian waltz, marinera, tango, jazz, all by ear. Peruvian popular music not only played an important role in the development of Iturriaga's childhood, but also later shaped his musical creativity. In the coastal regions of Peru where he grew up, the most common type of popular music during the first half of the twentieth century was música criolla. Although Iturriaga's exposure to music in his early years was predominantly that of popular idioms, the family's Victrola gramophone also gave him the opportunity to explore a selection of music and art. Due to the difficulties in properly recording piano and string instruments in acoustic and electrical recordings, most of the repertoire recorded in the 1920s consisted of short and arian songs, however, even the vocal recordings were as Poor quality that the singer's voice sounded like \\"horrendous scream\\" and the accompanying orchestra was almost inaudible. However, in an isolated environment, such as the city of Huacho, where Iturriaga spent his childhood, the opportunities for music concerts of different artistic angles are very rare, and as a result, Iturriaga could satisfy his curiosity for music art only by Gramophone use. Iturriaga learned to play popular music with relative ease because of his keen ear, but was not interested in becoming a popular music artist; rather, it was the invention of original piano pieces that fascinated him most. However, I needed basic music training before I could start composition studies. In 1932, at the age of fourteen, he auditioned in Lima for Lily Rosay, piano teacher at the Sas-Rosay Academy of Music. Although he could not read music, Iturriaga presented an interpretation in C minor for Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 – original key is different – that he learned completely by ear. Between 1934 and 1939 he studied piano with Lily Rosay and began studying theory and harmony with Andrés Sas. He enters the National University of San Marcos and studies in the faculty of letters, then leaves his studies to enter the National Conservatory of Music. There he would work with Rodolfo Holzmann from 1945 to 1950. At the Conservatory he graduated as a composition teacher. In 1947, when he was still a student he won the Duncker Lavalle National Prize for his work Canción y muerte de Rolando for voice and orchestra, on a text by the poet Jorge Eduardo Eielson. He has formed an important number of Peruvian composers. He has been director of the National Conservatory of Music. He was part of the group of Peruvian composers who in the 1950s renewed the art music of their country, through the introduction of new musical techniques and the improvement of musical work. In 1950 he traveled to France with a scholarship granted by the Government of that country. In Paris he took classes with Arthur Honegger. Between 1953 and 1960 he was a music critic of the newspaper El Comercio in Lima. In April 1957 he won the Juan Landaeta Prize for his work Suite for Orchestra, in the contest called by the second Latin American Festival in Caracas. That same year he was called as professor at the National Conservatory of Music. In 1963 he traveled to the United States, invited to meet and study the work of universities and other higher institutions in the field of music. The same year he traveled to Santiago de Chile, invited by the University of Chile to attend the Inter- American Congress of Musical Educators. In 1965, the committee for the third Ibero-American Festival in Washington, D.C., commissioned him with a symphonic work: Iturriaga composed Vivencias – four pieces for orchestra – which was premiered by Lukas Foss and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, New York. Between 1973 and 1976 he was director of the National School of Music. In 1999 he was elected as general director of the National Conservatory of Music. He also served as a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and the National University of San Marcos. On November 23, 2019, the orchestral composer died at 101. The news was confirmed by the Gran Teatro Nacional del Perú.  Works  His works are halfway between modernist and traditional tendencies, so in his works he mixes these styles alternately. Among his most important works are Pregón y danza for piano, Sinfonía Junín y Ayacucho for symphony orchestra, Canción y muerte de Rolando for orchestra, Homenaje a Stravinski, for orchestra Cuatro poemas de Javier Heraud for voice and piano, Las cumbres for choir a capella, Vivencias – his only serial work – for orchestra, Preludio y fuga for a Santiago for metals, among others. Iturriaga is part of a group of Peruvian composers formed by the German-born musician Rodolfo Holzmann. In addition to teaching and criticism, his dissemination work was expanded with the publication of the books La música en el Perú – in co-authorship – and Método de composición melódica.

Awards  Iturriaga garnered recognition early, when in 1947 he won the Dunker Lavalle Award for his work for voice and orchestra Canción y muerte de Rolando, inspired by the famous poem by Jorge Eduardo Eielson. This contest won it again in 1971 with Homenaje a Stravinsky para orquesta y cajón solista. In 1957 he won the Juan Landaeta Prize, Caracas; and in 1965, the Third Ibero-American Festival of Washington commissioned him with a work Vivencias, that was premiered by the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra. In 2005 he was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Peruvian Culture of the National Institute of Culture of Peru.

Industrialization in the Russian Empire was a reaction to the industrialization process in Western Europe countries. The first steps related to accelerating the development of industry were taken during the reign of Peter I. However, the beginning of the introduction of machine production in leading industries and vehicles was in the second quarter of the 19th century. This period is considered to be the beginning of the industrial revolution in Russian Empire. The industrialization process continued until 1917. Later in the years of Soviet industrialization. Russia was in the role of catching up, trying to catch up with the advanced countries of the West in terms of industrial development.  History   Industry during the reign of Peter I  Peter I was aware of the need for the country to land for the development of efficient trade. To accomplish this task, a combat-ready army was needed. The combat readiness of the army depended directly on the level of development of the economy and, above all, on the degree of development metallurgical, textile, cloth and other industries. The first years of the 18th century were associated with the active construction of metallurgical factories. In 1702–1707. Lipetsk, Kozminsk and Borin factories with a total number of more than 500 workers are being built. In Karelia in 1703, the equally large Petrovsky and Povenetsky plants were built. A little later, in 1704–1705, the Konchezersky plant and the Tyrpitsky ammunition plants will appear. All these plants used raw materials of a low level and the quality of the metal produced was not the best, but the small distance of these plants from the place of hostilities was invaluable. At the same time, metallurgical plants were being built in the Ural (region), including a large silver mining plant was founded in 1704 in Nerchinsk, which was of great importance for the future development of the monetary business and the country's economy. As a result of this construction, an industry was created that was able to equip the army with powerful artillery and other weapons. Over 28 private and company-owned and 7 state-owned iron factories, one state-owned and two company-owned copper plants, arose in Central Russia in the first third of the 18th century. In the Urals there are about 15 copper state-owned and private factories, and about 10 and 5 state-owned iron factories. In the first quarter of the 18th century, due to a sharp increase in the size of the army and navy, the textile and especially sailing-and-linen industry began to develop rapidly. In particular, the Moscow Admiralty Sailing Factory, which employed more than a thousand people. In the 1720s century the number of textile manufactories reached 40 (of which 24 are only in Moscow). According to various sources, from Peter the Great, from 98 to 180 relatively large manufactories were built.1.История России XVIII–XIX веков. Л. В. Милов, Н. И. Цимбаев, 2006.

Сельское хозяйство — основа экономики России Глава 20.2 However, Peter I conducted a series of laws that aggravated the situation of peasants and prevented the creation of a wage labor market.  Industry during the reign of Catherine II After the death of Peter I, up to the middle of the century, the industry of Russia, in spite of everything, continued to develop. By 1750, about a hundred metallurgical plants were already operating, and cast iron smelting reached approximately 2 million pounds. In the middle of the 18th century, Russia took the first place in the world in the smelting of cast iron and became its main exporter to Europe. A new period of significant development of industry is associated with the reign of Catherine II. The most noticeable growth was observed in the field of metallurgy and the textile industry, and details of industrialization in the field of agriculture are also visible. In the field of metallurgical production and metalworking, at the beginning of Catherine's reign there were 182 enterprises, and at the end of the 18th century about 200. The growth was small, but now they were larger enterprises. История России XVIII–XIX веков. Л. В. Милов, Н. И. Цимбаев, 2006. ООО «Издательство «Эксмо», 2006, гл. 10 пр. 4 Sailing and linen industry also developed. Russian canvas was in great and constant demand in England and other sea powers. At the end of the sixties in the textile industry there were 231 large enterprises, including 73 woolen factories, 85 linen and 60 silk. At the end of the 18th century, the number of textile enterprises reached 1082, of which 158 were woolen, 318 were linen and 357 were silk. Thus, for more than three decades, there was a more than four-fold increase. Along with traditional extensive methods, intensive methods began to be used more and more widely. In agricultural practice, especially in the largest, richest farms, plow and fertilizers were used. Sowings of agricultural crops expanded, including more valuable ones - wheat, potatoes, buckwheat, industrial and medicinal plants, etc. At this time, there was a certain interest of the \\"enlightened\\" nobility in improving the agricultural sector. The founding of the Free Economic Society (1765) contributed to the propaganda of the achievements of agronomic science, although so far on a \\"focal\\" scale. Catherine II also took steps to mitigate the situation of peasants in the Russian Empire. The decrees of Catherine II on the ban on the purchase of serfs to factories and their registration with enterprises and on the free foundation of industrial enterprises for all sectors of society (1775) intensified the process of attracting hired workers to production. In turn, manufactories continued to use both hired and non-free labor. Serf labor continued to dominate mining and metallurgy, especially in the Urals. In large industrial enterprises by the end of the century, over 40% of employees were wage-earners. Wage labor was especially prevalent in the textile industry and exceeded 90% However, unfree labor in feudal Russia still impeded the transition to factory production.12.Экономическая история Поляк Г.Б., 2016. Глава 19.3 Формирование капиталистического уклада во второй половине XVIII в.  Industrial development in the first half of the 19th century  In Russia, the industrial revolution began in the 1820s, went extremely slowly and ended after the abolition of serfdom. This process was completed no earlier than the 1880s, when the technical and social restructuring of the Ural mining industry, which was entirely based on serf labor, ended. The serf system, in turn, narrowed down the possibilities of creating a free-labor market and was the main obstacle to the industrial revolution. An important problem of industrialization in the Russian Empire at that time was the technical component of this process. In England, starting from the 1760s, and after it in other Western European countries, there was a process of accumulation of technical experience and the introduction of technical inventions, which became the condition for the transition to machine production. In the Russian Empire, the manufacturing owners did not show much interest in innovations. Only at the end of the 18th century, at the government's initiative, did a discussion begin on a large-scale project that concerned the use of English comb out and spinning machines. However, manual labor continued to dominate almost completely in Russian factories until the 1840s. At this time, the import of machinery and machine tools into the country increased. In the years 1841-1845 they were imported in the amount of 668 thousand rubles, in the next five years this amount more than doubled, and in the first half of the 1850s amounted to more than two million rubles. This started the process of crowding out the manufacturing with a factory, which proceeded extremely unevenly in different industries and in different regions. On the basis of a centralized manufactory, industries such as paper and glass developed, the products of which mainly met the country's needs. Since the beginning of the century, the number of enterprises in paper production had almost tripled and reached 165. Here about 80% of production was produced using machines. Crisis phenomena were observed in the mining industry of the Urals, where manufactory production was based on monopoly and forced labor. In the pre-reform period, cast iron smelting increased slightly (from 10 million pounds at the beginning of the century to 18 million pounds by 1861). At this time, in the UK smelting pig iron reached 240 million pounds. And while at the end of the 18th century Russia accounted for about a third of the world smelting of pig iron, by 1860 its share did not exceed 4%. Weak technical base made the production of metallurgical plants noncompetitive. The labor productivity of workers attached to factories was low, and the owners of mining plants did not introduce steam engines, relying on the cheapness of manual labor. Only in the 1850s, the obsolete critical method of iron production began to be replaced by puddling. However, the owners of the plants did not use coal for puddling, which led to large-scale deforestation, to an increase in production costs and to an even wider use of non-economic forms of exploitation of workers. The crisis in the mining industry also affected the position of state-owned military factories, where modern metalworking and mechanical production increasingly dealt with the supply of low-quality raw materials. The serfdom slowed down the introduction of technical discoveries and inventions into the industry.The low cost of serfdom made it unprofitable to replace it with machine labor based on the use of steam engines. Entrepreneurs were not interested in raising the qualifications of the workforce; labor productivity at state-owned and private-owned manufactories grew extremely slowly. An incomplete industrial revolution doomed the country to lagging behind industrialized European countries. The completion of the industrial revolution and the overcoming of this lag was directly related to the elimination of serfdom, since serfdom was the main obstacle to the emergence in Russia of a free wage labor market.6.История России XVIII–XIX веков. Л. В. Милов, Н. И. Цимбаев, 2006. ООО «Издательство «Эксмо», 2006, гл. 17  Industrial development in the second half of the 19th century  In Russia in 1861, peasant reform (also known as the abolition of serfdom) was carried out. This reform created the conditions necessary for the victory of the capitalist mode of production. The main of these conditions was the personal liberation of 23 million serfs who formed the wage labor market. Николай Троицкий Россия в XIX веке: Курс лекций. Падение крепостного права In the post-reform period, an industrial revolution ended in Russia. After 1861, all the prerequisites arose for the final conversion of manufacturing into factory production. By the early 1880s, the main industrial products began to be produced at factories and plants using machines and mechanisms driven by steam. Factory production on the basis of civilian labor pushed into the background manufactory in all leading industries. At the end of the 1870s, 58% of the textile industry was produced on 50 thousand mechanical looms. Factories accounted for three quarters of textile and more than 80% of metal products, about 90% of sugar production. Two-thirds of the energy needed for metallurgy came from steam engines and turbines. Manual labor occupied leading positions only in the leather, furniture, and in some sectors of the food industry. In the late 1880s and up to the end of the century, primarily heavy industry developed at a rapid pace, the volume of production of which increased by 4 times, and the number of workers doubled. If in the 80s large mechanized enterprises were rare among the huge mass of artisanal production, then in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. In all major sectors, large and largest enterprises dominated. The industrial development of the 1880s was marked by extreme regional and sectoral unevenness. At the end of the decade, it ended with a new systemic crisis, which was part of the recession in world industrial production and was accompanied by an agrarian crisis. In search of a way out of this difficult situation, the government made deliberate efforts that led to an unprecedented industrial boom that began in 1893. The years of this boom were a time of economic modernization of Russia under the auspices of the state.  Industry of the Russian Empire of the 20th century before the First World War  In the industry of the Russian Empire there was a period of slowdown in comparison with the end of the 19th century.

This is especially evident in the example of grain crops: in the first 14 years of the 20th century, the sown area increased by 15%, grain yield by 10%, grain harvest per capita by more than 20%.http://antisgkm.narod.ru/hist4.htm Gross grain harvest - 5637 million poods (92.5 million tons) - 1 place in the world (half the world rye crop, second place in wheat harvest), as well as 1 place in grain export - 647.8 million poods were exported (10.61 million tons) of grain.http://antisgkm.narod.ru/hist4.htm The total volume of grain exports amounted to 651 million rubles. Russia ranked 1st in the production and export of butter (77576 tons of butter exported).http://antisgkm.narod.ru/hist4.htm At the same time, in terms of per capita GDP, the Russian Empire did not belong to world leaders. GDP per capita, calculated in 1990 Giri-Khamis international dollars, in the Russian Empire in 1913 was $1,488 per person with a world average of $1,524, which was below the level of all European countries except Portugal, and approximately corresponded to the level of Japan and the average Latin America level. GDP per capita was 3.5 times lower than in the United States, 3.3 times lower than in the UK, 1.7 times lower than in ItalyПо оценкам Гренингенского центра роста и развития (The Groningen Growth and Development Centre), исследования под руководством Энгаса Мэддисона (Angus Maddison), см. таблицу (ссылка на все исследование, ссылка на таблицу)  The industry of the Russian Empire in the First World War  Despite the ordeals during the First World War, the industry of the Russian Empire continued to grow. Compared to 1913, industrial production grew by 21.5%. For example, in the same time period, industrial production in the UK decreased by 11%, and in Germany it decreased as much as 36%.

Biography William H. \\"Will\\" Clayson was born in Port Gamble, Washington Territory to English immigrant parents, Edward Clayson and Annie Mary Quinton. By 1869, the family had settled in a logging camp near Seabeck, Washington Territory, where a sister, Esther, and a brother, Frederick, were born. The family moved to Portland in 1883, where another sister, Charlotte, was born. Will attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. Alaska In July 1897, just weeks after hearing the news that gold had been discovered in the Klondike, Will's brother Frederick sailed for Skagway, Alaska. He was accompanied by their brother-in-law, Emil Pohl, who had married Esther three years prior. Will followed in September, and helped Frederick to open an outfitting store, F.W. Clayson and Company. Their mother, who had divorced their father some years hence, joined them. Esther followed the next year, having completing post-graduate studies in Chicago. When Frederick was murdered on the Dawson Trail on Christmas Day, 1899, Will was appointed executor of his estate. He continued to managed the Skagway store. Will's first marriage, to a woman named Cecilia, produced a son, William, Jr. In 1905, he opened Clayson the Clothier, a clothing store, in Seward, Alaska. In 1909, he moved to Cordova to start another store. Eventually, he was remarried to the Canadian-born Mabel Tuck, and by 1923, he operated a store in Anchorage, Alaska. Political career and later years In 1925, Clayson was elected to the Anchorage City Council, and two years later, on April 5, 1927, he was elected to succeed Chris M. Eckmann as Mayor of Anchorage, defeating W.B. Dean 319 to 278. As mayor, Clayson promoted improvements to infrastructure, including water and sewer lines, streets and sidewalks, and the city's docks. It was during Clayson's tenure that the city council approved an ordinance authorizing the construction of the Eklutna Dam by Frank Ivan Reed's Anchorage Light and Power Company. Clayson did not run for a second term. Clayson became an early investor in Anchorage Air Transport, Inc, which was founded in 1926 to capitalize on growing demand for commercial aviation. It operated flights from the field later known as the Delaney Park Strip. Clayson moved to Portland in 1929, returning each year to mind his business interests in Alaska. He died in 1950, at the age of 82.

About The National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) event takes place annually in early November at the Kansas Star Arena in Mulvane, Kansas. The NFSR is a separate event from the National Finals Rodeo, which holds the finals for all of the other PRCA rodeo events in December at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.Wrangler NFR, Finals Event Details, p. 354. Steer roping In the steer roping rodeo event, a cowboy and horse pursue a steer whose horns have been reinforced for protection. The cowboy must lasso the steer's horns and then ties the rope to his saddle. He must stop his horse promptly so that it throws the steer to the ground. The cowboy then quickly dismounts in order to tie three of the steer's legs together. He raises both hands to indicate completion. Just like tie-down roping, the tie must hold for six seconds. Steer roping is a timed event such that the competitor with the fastest time wins. Records In 2016, Cody Lee set a record for most money won at $69,651. The fastest time recorded is 8.3 seconds and it is shared by three cowboys: Cash Myers (2006), Jess Tierney (2015), and Guy Allen (2016). In 2015, Trevor Brazile set the record for the fastest time on 10 head at 111.3 seconds. In 2012, Cody Scheck set the fastest roping time at 7.7 seconds for a PRCA event, at Fort Smith, Arkansas. From 1977-2008, Guy Allen has the most finals qualifications at 32 counting all PRCA events. From 1991-2001, Guy Allen won the most consecutive world titles at 11 in a row. Across all events.

It is a pest of banana cultivation and has a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in all parts of the world in which bananas are grown. It is considered the most serious insect pest of bananas. Description The adult banana root borer is about in length and has a glossy greyish-black or dark brown appearance. Unlike the billbugs (Sphenophorus), the thorax lacks depressions. The tibia of each of the limbs bears an accessory hook-like claw with which the insect clings to plants. The larva is plump and whitish with a reddish-brown head. The eighth abdominal segment of the larva bears a large spiracle, the remaining segments bearing small spiracles; the last two segments appear truncated, being fused together to form a plate-like structure. The pupa has an irregular appearance, with the developing wings and limbs being discernable through the pupal case. Distribution The banana root borer probably originated in southeastern Asia and Indonesia. It now has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found in all the banana-growing regions of the world: southwestern Europe, southern Asia, Africa, Australia, South and Central America, the West Indies and Mexico. In the United States it is restricted to Monroe and Miami-Dade Counties in Florida. It is easily transported from one place to another in the larval stage, inside sections of root or corm. Ecology Banana root borers feed on any species of Musa (banana), but they show a preference for plantains and East African Highland bananas (matoke) over dessert and brewing bananas. They are attracted to the host plants by the volatile chemicals given off, especially from damaged corms. They have been reported as feeding on Manila hemp, sugarcane and yams, but they probably only do this when they are unable to access banana plants. The adult female deposits her eggs singly between the leaf sheath and the stem, or at the base of the stem in the vicinity of the corm. On hatching about six days later, the larvae burrow into the stem or the root, and it is their burrowing activities that weaken the plant and make it liable to be blown over. The complete life cycle takes 30 to 40 days, including a larval stage of 15 to 20 days. In southeastern Asia, the banana root borer is preyed on by the beetle Plaesius javanus, which feeds on the eggs, all the larval stages, the pupae and the adults. This beetle has been introduced to other parts of the root borer's range to attempt biological pest control. Damage The tunnelling activities of the root borer weaken the stem, make the plant more susceptible to lodging, cause reduced uptake of nutrients, and result in crop damage and lower yields. Newly planted stands fail to thrive, and the damage increases over time. The adults are nocturnal, are poor fliers, and have low fecundity; their dispersal is limited. Planting insect-free roots or tissue culture plantlets may be effective for a few years before insects move in from surrounding areas. The removal and destruction of crop residues is another means of reducing damage from this pest and increasing yields. Another possible control method is attracting the adults with pheromones and trapping them.

Life  Born in 1896 in a farming family. Together with his younger brother Timofei (Timothy during his later life in the US) he was orphaned at the age of 9. Thanks to the guardians, he enrolled in and graduated from the Kharkov Institute of Agriculture and Forestry as an agronomist. In the inter-war period, he published several statistical works, which mainly discussed issues of land plot lease in the Ukrainian SSR. At the beginning of 1932, he was accused of having \\"anti-Marxist prejudices\\" and \\"stirring up pro-Kulak sentiments\\", after which he was forced to quit his job. In 1932-1936 he worked as an agronomist in Yakymivka District, Zaporizhia Oblast, where he witnessed the mass famine (later known as Holodomor) and later claimed that he had developed an anti-Soviet sentiments just at that time. In September 1941, he was offered a job in Moscow, but he declined and stayed in Kharkov, which was occupied shortly thereafter by the German troops, together with his two sons, his mother-in-law and his sick wife. At the end of November 1941 he was unemployed. On November 24, 1941, he got a job in the Agricultural Administration, where he worked as head of the economic statistics department. In July 1943 he visited Germany as part of a delegation of agronomists from the Kharkov region. In early August 1943, during the Soviet offensive on Kharkov, his wife moved to Kiev with their sons Vladimir (1926) and Alexander (1927). From there they moved together to the Odessa region. From September 13, 1942 to January 24, 1943, he published 5 articles in the weekly newspaper \\"Novaya Ukraina\\" (New Ukraine) in Kharkov.https://libraria.ua/numbers/306/ The articles discussed the events of the Collectivization and the 1932 - 1933 famine. Sosnovy analyzed the nationalization process in the agricultural sector of the Ukrainian SSR and criticized the Bolshevik agricultural policy. He noted that since authorities took most of their livestock from peasants in the years of collectivization, they lost their economic independence. In analyzing the role of MTS (Machinery and Tractor Stations), S. Sosnovy showed that the creation and enforcement of these stations in Ukraine actually led to the creation of a state agricultural monopoly. Comparing statistics with other years, including the lean years, he believed that Ukraine had enough grain from the 1932 harvest to feed the population and even livestock. He noted that the excessive corn procurement plan was a killer factor for the peasants because every last grain was confiscated in order to fulfill the plan. Thanks to the use of the 1926 census data of Soviet Ukraine and a series of open statistical and economic collections from the 1930s, Sosnovy was the first Ukrainian scientist who attempted to estimate the number of victims of the famine. In 1943-1944, his article \\"The Truth About the 1932-1933 Famine in Ukraine\\" was reprinted in several other newspapers in the occupied territories. His younger brother Timothy (died 1983), a member of OUN-M, emigrated (Germany, later USA), where he began to teach and contribute to the dissemination of his brother's research. On 2 and 5 February 1950 S. Sosnovy's work was reprinted by the emigration newspaper \\"Ukrainski Visti\\" (Ukrainian News), which appeared in the German city of Neu-Ulm for displaced persons of Ukrainian descent. In the same year, an article by S. Sosnovy on the 1932-1933 famine came out as a separate pamphlet, and in 1953 was published in English translation in the first volume of the document collection The Black Deeds of the Kremlin, along with other evidence of the mass extermination of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  Postwar years  After the war, he worked as an agronomist and economist, without caring to conceal his name. On February 21, 1950, he was arrested by the State Security Ministry because his former Kharkov employees testified against him. He was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in forced labor camps, with 5 years loss of rights and complete confiscation of property. He served for six years in a labor camp near Sheksna Station in Vologda Oblast. After his release he suffered a disability and settled in the village of Pavlovka, Artsyz District in the Odessa Oblast. By that time his wife Maria Derbek had died. In 1956, at the age of 62, Stepan Sosnovy concluded his second marriage, with Euphrosyne Poremska. Soon, the couple moved with one of the sons of Stepan Sosnovy to Kiev. A decision of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR of 11 April 1958 abolished the loss of rights and cleared his criminal record. He died on March 26, 1961 at the age of 66.

It is also referred to as the Chapel of Our Lady of Nazareth of Engenho Itaperoá (). The church is located on the former Fazenda Itaperoá, a sugarcane plantation, west of the city center São Cristóvão. The church belonged to the Parish of Our Lady of Victory (Freguesia de Nossa Senhora da Victória), which included Santo Antônio and São Gonçalo, in Camassari. It was listed as a historic structure by the State of Sergipe in 1984; despite its heritage designation, the church is in advanced state of ruin. Structure The church has a large nave, chancel, side galleries, and porches. The chancel and sacristy had independent, lower roofs than that of the nave. It has an elaborate baroque- style pediment with volutes; it likely had an image in the tympanum, but the pediment is in a state of advanced ruin. The church has three portals at the ground level and three windows at the choir level. The facade is flanked by two large bell towers corresponding to the two interior side corridors. Each tower has a small door corresponding to the central doors of the church at the lower level and a window above corresponding to those of the choir level. Each tower is topped by a dome surmounted by a pyramid-shaped pinnacle. The corridors have three windows at the upper level and two small portals below. It church likely connected to other buildings on the plantation, an architectural feature found on numerous sugarcane plantations of the period in Sergipe and Bahia. In both design and scale it resembles the Chapel of the Nossa Senhora da Penha Sugar Plantation in nearby Riachuelo and the Church of Tejupeba House and the Chapel of the Colégio Sugar Plantation in Itaporanga D'Ajuda. Protected status The Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Nazaré was listed as a historic structure by the State of Sergipe on January 6, 1984 under Decree No. 6.128 of 1984. It is one of two protected rural chapel structures in São Cristóvão, the other being the Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim.

Career Upon enlisting in the Navy in March 1974, she inquired a Navy recruiter about the possibility of her becoming a diver. Her question was immediately shot down as “women can’t get in [to dive school],” and she chose to focus on shipfitting and hull technician. While working as a shipfitter and hull technician for the Navy, she applied for a waiver to attend dive school. She was required to get permission from The Pentagon before being assigned to training in Norfolk. At the age of 21, she applied to the Navy 2nd Class Diving School and was accepted two days before the program started in January 1975. During training, she was required to dive while carrying more than 200 pounds of gear in dark, cold or turbulent water. Despite this, Tobias became the first woman to graduate from the Navy Deep Sea Diving School and went on to work with the Navy search and salvage operations. However, she was still limited opportunities due to her gender. She was unable to join sea duty billets so she accepted a position as an instructor at the Submarine Escape Training Tank at Submarine Naval Base in New London. Tobias also worked within the hyperbaric chamber to treat divers suffering embolisms and civilians suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning and gangrene. Retired Master Diver Steven Lechner believed Tobias was the first woman to teach in the escape tank. Her brother Gary was also enrolled in the army, and she was his instructor at the diving school on base. After eight years in the Navy, Tobias earned her bachelor's degree in education and a master's in psychology and taught special-education classes at New London High School. In 2001, she was inducted into the Women Diver's Hall of Fame. Death At the age of 58, Tobias committed suicide due to depression on September 21, 2010. Legacy In 2018, the Naval Submarine Base New London unveiled a dive locker named after Tobias.

She writes novels and short stories for children and young people. Having obtained her bachelor's degree, she worked for several years as a graphic designer and publishing before starting to write professionally. She has been awarded on five occasions the Darío Guevara Mayorga Children's and Young People's National Award, and she was awarded with the Latin American Children's and Young People's Norma-Fundalectura prize for her novel Amigo se escribe H. In 2015 her book Strange Days, co-written with Roger Ycaza, won the A la Orilla del Viento award of the Fondo de Cultura Económica.  Career  Children's literature was never in her plans, it emerged spontaneously when she was 22 years old as a way of exploring her own feelings, looking for answers in a time of personal crisis. When the first editor that read her stories told her it was children's literature, María Fernanda was stunned. After several years writing short stories she wrote her first novel in 2001 Amigo se escribe con H, but when she presented it to two publishing houses they turned it down,saying it was not a commercially viable. Although María Fernanda was discouraged, a close friend of hers prompted her to register her novel for the Latin American Children's Literature Norma- Fundalectura Prize, the most important prize in the region in the field, which she won.  Style  Her lectors and editors highlights her simple style, full of emotions and sense of humour. Heredia writes, from her own words \\"to readers that thrpugout humour and love find the key to understand the sense of life\\". The most relevant characters form her piece are the grandparents, who give a sense of affection, warmth and wisdom in each situation. Also, her stories about \\"the first love\\" are very significative: \\"Friend is written with H\\" (\\"Amigo se escribe con H\\"), \\"Cupid is a bat\\" (\\"Cupido es un muerciélago\\"), \\"There are words that fish don´t understand\\" (\\"Hay palabras que los peces no entienden\\"), \\"Broken Hard Operation\\" (\\"Operación Corazón Roto\\"), among others; where romantic love is in a second plane to give its way to a more cheerful, real and sometimes foolish love. At the same time, her work puts in question the adult world - divorce, abandonment, rupture, domestic violence- or current issues at the school context such as bullying, harassment, stalking, sexting, etc. Even though her style is always fresh and delicate, this is not a reason to elude important and serious matters in the life of children and the youth, creating in this way a natural and spontaneous identification with the reader: \\"In my books I don´t speak to children in a maternal or a pedagogycal way, and is probable that this is the reason to connect with complicity and closeness with them. I think that language is simple, clear and a wide metaphor that allow to reach kids and also adults\\".

The bridge links downtown Winnipeg with the Norwood neighbourhood of Winnipeg. The bridge serves Route 52. The bridge bears a sculpture called River Arch between the east and west spans at the southern landing. The sculpture was commissioned by the City of Winnipeg and was the winning proposal in a national competition by artist Catherine Widgery. The sculpture is made of stone, stainless steel, aluminum, gold leaf, and concrete, and includes an arch and two 40ft columns, each topped with golden sheaves of wheat. The arch bears a pixellated image from a photograph of a harvested field. Each column bears a sculpture of the head of a bison on each side of the base. Bridge history The first bridge The first Norwood bridge was a privately built toll bridge, complete in 1890. It was purchased by the City of St Boniface in 1904. The first Norwood bridge was deemed unsafe in 1929, and negotiations toward construction of a replacement bridge began in the fall of 1930 between the City of Winnipeg and the City of St Boniface. The second bridge The original cost estimate for the Norwood Bridge replacement was $620,000, with costs shared between the federal and provincial governments, as well as both the City of Winnipeg and City of St Boniface. The bridge was built in the 1930s, and was eventually demolished by McColman & Sons Demolition Ltd. The bridge had consisted of approximately 1,400 tons of steel and 2,000 meters of concrete. The current bridge The construction of the current bridge required relocation of the City of Winnipeg Water Utility pumphouse from the east side of Main Street to the west side of Main street. The Norwood Bridge was constructed by PCL Constructors of Canada. The foundation consists of four cast-in-place piers founded on tremied bedrock footings. The construction of bridge was the first in Winnipeg to use large, flat-topped barges instead of work bridges, and implemented northern ice road building techniques to use large cranes and other construction equipment on the river. . The bridge was opened on 19 October 1999.

Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets such as equities and fixed income, and use a blockchain virtual ledger system to store and validate token transactions. Due to tokens being classified as securities, STOs are more susceptible to regulation and thus represent a more secure investment alternative than ICOs, which have been subject to numerous fraudulent schemes. Furthermore, since ICOs are not held in traditional exchanges, they can be a less expensive funding source for small and medium-sized companies when compared to an IPO. An STO on a regulated stock exchange (referred to as a tokenized IPO) has the potential to deliver significant efficiencies and cost savings, however. By the end of 2019, STOs have been used in multiple scenarios including the trading of Nasdaq-listed company stocks, the pre-IPO of World Chess, FIDE's official broadcasting platform, and the creation of Singapore Exchange's own STO market, backed by Japan's Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings. Controversy regarding ICOs Though sharing some core concepts with ICOs and IPOs, STOs are in fact different from both, standing as an intermediary model. Similarly to ICOs, STOs are offerings that are made by selling digital tokens to the general public in cryptocurrency exchanges. The main difference stands in the fact that ICO tokens are the offered cryptocurrency's actual coins, entirely digital, and classified as utilities. New ICO currencies can be generated ad infinitum, as might in some cases their tokens. Additionally, their value is almost entirely speculative and arises from the perceived utility value buyers expect them to provide. Security tokens, on the other hand, are actual securities, like bonds or stocks, tied to a real company. In this sense, STOs are actually more similar to IPOs, with the difference being that one isn't required to be an accredited investor with a high net worth to take part in the initial offering. Just like securities obtained from IPOs, security tokens can guarantee voting rights, dividends, among other entitlements. This democratization of initial company share offerings has caused STOs to be labeled \\"The Everyman's IPO\\". In terms of legislation, some jurisdictions do treat STOs, ICOs, and other cryptocurrency-related operations under the same legislative umbrella. In general, though, STOs are placed under securities legislation (together with traditional IPOs), and ICOs under utilities, with the differentiation being made mostly on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting that even in countries where STOs and ICOs are under the same legislation, security tokens still require a connection to a registered company with real assets being sold. The main debate surrounding security tokens is, thus, the legal differentiation of what can be qualified as a utility instead of a security. Generally, legislation understands that if a passive financial return is expected from the investment, then it is classified as a security. This way, even if the offering company understands their tokens are merely a utility asset with no expected return investment, if it can be proven otherwise then the ICO becomes an unregulated STO, passive of legal punishment. Moreover, this assumption of utility has been abused by some STO offering companies to sell securities without regulatory compliance (maliciously labeled as ICOs). This legal ambiguity has led to some ICO offerers being prosecuted by the SEC as a security offering part, though their tokens were announced as utilities. Such companies include messaging apps Kik and Telegram, the former being sued by the SEC for over $100 million and the latter delaying their offering plans after similar prosecution. Regulation One of the main selling points of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has been the decentralization aspect, by which no government can influence or control the currency. By extension, a cryptocurrency is not directly affected by a specific country's jurisdiction, sociopolitical environment, or economic events (although volatility to such matters has been perceived numerous times). Such a lack of regulation has led to the rising of large-scale crypto- related criminal activity, ranging from terrorist funding to tax evasion, most of which go untracked and unpunished. Similarly, ICO scams have been an increasingly troublesome matter, causing billions of dollars in losses and damaging the cryptocurrency market's value as a whole. Security token offerings are seen as a direct response to such matters, being tied to real, registered assets, and regulated by a specific jurisdiction while still allowing such jurisdiction to be picked by the offering party (upon legal registration and permission request). Criticism regarding this attribute includes the possibility of evading one's country's laws to digitally perform the same action somewhere else. So far, STOs have been regulated and legalized in many countries where ICOs have not, due to fitting in many already pre- existing regulations regarding securities. {  - ! Jurisdiction !! Status !!

History The BP&GVR; system in 1909. The station was opened as Pembrey Halt on 2 August 1909 by the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway on the Kidwelly and Burry Port section of the line and was closed by the British Transport Commission in 1953 with the last passenger train running on Saturday 19 September 1953. It was on the southern section of the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway with Craiglon Bridge Halt to the north and Burry Port to the south at the end of the passenger line. The line had been built on the course of an old canal with resulting tight curves, low bridge clearance and a tendency to flooding.

The Senate bill () was introduced on April 9, 2019 by Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, and Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins. The House bill () was introduced by Democratic Congressman Dan Kildee.  Background  United States Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), the lead sponsor of the Senate bill U.S. Representative Dan Kildee (D-MI), the lead sponsor of the House bill A 2019 Chevrolet Bolt, one of the electric vehicles that would be covered with the tax credit under this legislation. The Nissan Leaf electric car.  Electric vehicle adoption in the United States  According to the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned utility companies, there were over 1.27 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the roads in the United States as of June 2019. Sales of EVs have grown: total sales of EVs in the U.S. in 2018 were 81 percent higher than in 2017. Around 85,000 EVs were purchase in the U.S. between April and June 2019.  Electric vehicle tax credit history  To spur growth in the adoption of electric vehicles by U.S. consumers, in 2008 Congress created the electric vehicle tax credit by passing the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, which President George W. Bush signed. The new law created the \\"Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit,\\" the formal name for the electric vehicle tax credit. The following year, President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) extended the life of the tax credit to people who bought their electric vehicles after 2009. Congress structured the law in a way that phases out the tax credit for each automobile manufacturer once they sell 200,000 qualifying electric vehicles. Many top sellers, such as General Motors and Tesla, will soon reach or have already reached that cap.  Fraud potential  In October 2019, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released a report of an audit it had conducted. In its audit, the agency found that \\"millions of dollars in potentially erroneous plug-in tax credits are being claimed for ineligible vehicles on income tax returns—to the tune of $82 million from tax years 2013 through 2017.\\"  Legislative details  The legislation extends two specific tax credits: electric vehicle purchases and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle purchases. Under the bill, when people buy qualifying electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, they get a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their federal tax liability (taxes owed for that year). For example, if someone's federal income tax is $7,500 for the year, and they purchase an electric vehicle that qualifies for a $7,500 tax credit, that person would not owe anything in federal taxes for that year.  Electric vehicles  Under current law, the first 200,000 electric vehicles manufactured by each automaker come with a $7,500 tax credit to the consumers who buy them. The Driving America Forward Act would allow an additional 400,000 EVs to come with a tax credit (slightly less, at $7,000 per vehicle). Unless the bill is signed into law, people who buy EVs from manufacturers who have already sold over 200,000 electric vehicles do not get the tax credit. When the original bill in 2007 that created the tax credit was being considered, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), a sponsor of the bill, said that the tax credits were intended to be temporary as a means of “get[ting] these products over the initial stage of production.”  Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles  The bill also has a provision that extends a tax credit specifically for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles through the year 2028.  Cost  The bill's estimated cost to the federal government is $11.4 billion. This cost is calculated as a loss in tax revenues that the federal government would otherwise receive if the tax credits were not extended.  Cosponsors  The Senate bill (S. 1094) is sponsored by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The Senate bill is bipartisan and includes both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. Cosponsors as of November 21, 2019 are: * Lamar Alexander (R-TN) * Gary Peters (D-MI) * Susan Collins (R-ME) * Angus King (I-ME) * Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) * Margaret Wood Hassan (D-NH) * Patrick Leahy (D-VT) The House bill (H.R. 2256) is sponsored by Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-MI). There are 131 cosponsors in the House as of November 21, 2019. All 131 cosponsors are from the Democratic Party; no Republican members have cosponsored this bill in the House.  Legislative history  The official title of the bill is \\"A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify limitations on the credit for plug-in electric drive motor vehicles, and for other purposes.\\" The Senate bill (S. 1094) was introduced on April 9, 2019.

Other automobile manufacturers, automotive trade associations, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the Association of Global Automakers, electric utility companies, and pro-environment advocacy groups have come out in support of the bill. Supporters of the bill in Congress, as of spring of 2019, were planning to attach the bill to a larger tax reform bill that they had hoped would be considered for debate.  Opposition  One of the key opponents to the Driving America Forward Act is U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming. In October 2018, Barrasso attempted to stop the bill and instead replace it with a tax on electric vehicles that would go toward road repair projects. Another major opponent is the Trump Administration, which in March 2019 announced it wanted to eliminate the entire $7,500 tax credit. The reason the administration gave was that it would save the U.S. government $2.5 billion.

The line is unique for being the only WMATA bus line that runs to Loudoun County, has a connection with any Virginia non-commuter services, and is responsible for providing a regular link between the two services. The original $1.10 one-way fare was seen as a bargain compared with other transportation modes in the area, including Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus. In 2014, it was reported that the 5A line was partly responsible for Dulles Airport monthly ridership record. WMATA also provides higher levels of service on the line in special times of need, especially on certain holidays.  September 2020 proposed changes  On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to reduce time frequency on route 5Aservice in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. Although, WMATA planned to eliminate route 5A and replace it with the Silver Line service on its previous proposals. Silver Line In 2010, WMATA started a public planning forum, to create the Silver Line route to run to Dulles Airport. The Silver Line will bring riders access via train to serve in Maryland, Washington D.C., and the northeastern portion of Virginia. This project is under Phase 2 of the Silver Line, as Phase 1 runs up to Wiehle–Reston East station. Construction of Phase 2 started in 2014, and is scheduled to open in 2020. Metro officials then announced that the second phase may not be ready for service until about September 2020. Metro later re-evaluated the timetable for the second phase's launch and anticipates it will be ready for service on April 1, 2021, after the agency determines a budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year (and having taken the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). Dulles Airport station The Washington Dulles International Airport is expected to serve on its own train station, as the station is part of Phase 2 of the Silver Line. The station was originally planned to be underground, but the plans call for an above-ground station, which will be located next to daily parking garage 1 of the airport. The station will be connected to the terminal building using the existing pedestrian tunnel which connects the hourly and daily parking lots and parking garage 1 to the baggage claim level of the airport terminal, and which is equipped with moving sidewalks. The Dulles International Airport station is scheduled to open in April 2021, and expected to replace the 5A.

Early life Lui was born in Guangzhou. His father, Lui Can Ming, was also a painter. He studied economics at Guangzhou University. He moved to Hong Kong in 1948. While there, he worked as an inspector for the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company until 1966. Art and academic career Lui was active in organising Hong Kong art societies, alongside Chao Shao-an. In 1956, he was a founding member of the Hong Kong Chung Kok Chinese Art Club. He became an honorary adviser to the Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1962. In 1964, his paintings appeared in the Hong Kong Museum of Art. He taught ink painting at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Architecture, and also taught at the Chinese University's Department of Extra-Mural Studies in 1966. In 1968, he worked with his students to form the Tao Art Association. Lui taught prominent artists like Wucius Wong and Gu Mei. Lui was one of those attempting to bring Western modernism into Chinese art, making note of how artists like Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell were inspired by Asian calligraphy. Despite his admiration of modernism, he was also inspired by the traditional style of Huang Banruo (Wong Po-Yeh). In 1971, Lui was awarded an MBE for his contributions to the arts. He is most known for his \\"Zen\\" series of abstract paintings, created from the 1960s until his death. The paintings make use of philosophical and spiritual symbolism, showing Taoist and Buddhist motifs like the lotus and flames. Legacy Lui's paintings have appeared in multiple auctions by Christie's. In 2018, Oxford's Ashmolean Museum hosted an exhibition on Lui, calling him \\"one of the most significant artists in Hong Kong during the mid-twentieth century\\".

Service began in 2015 and originally traveled between Denver and Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Glenwood Springs. Service has since been expanded to connect Grand Junction, Durango, Gunnison, Alamosa, Pueblo, and Lamar among others. It is Colorado's first state-run bus service. History Bustang service began on July 13, 2015. Service was originally provided along three lines: the West Line from Denver to Glenwood Springs along I-70, the North Line from Denver to Fort Collins along I-25, and the South Line from Denver to Colorado Springs also along I-25. The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that there would be 87,376 passengers during the Bustang's first year of operation, but actually ridership surpassed 100,000. At first the buses ran only on weekdays, but weekend service was quickly added along the West Line to accommodate skiers and along the North Line through the \\"RamsRoute\\" program. RamsRoute was intended for students and only ran one round-trip bus per weekend. Regular weekend service to both Fort Collins and Colorado Springs was added in 2017. First year revenue totaled over $1,000,000, which was enough to cover 38% of Bustang's costs. In 2017, communities across Colorado began to lobby for expanded Bustang service. This came after the second year ridership for the Bustang reached 156,000. In early 2018, service was added between Lamar and Pueblo along US 50. The new program was dubbed \\"Outrider\\" and focuses on rural Colorado. The Outrider program was expanded in May by adding a line between Pueblo and Alamosa. Later that summer the West Line was extended to Grand Junction, with hopes that the route would hit 15,000 annual passengers. Two additional Outrider services began roughly at the same time. The first was between Durango and Grand Junction, and the second was between Denver and Gunnison. In December 2018, an additional route between Colorado Springs and the Denver Tech Center was started. Total ridership from July 2017 to June 2018 reached 194,064. In 2019, there was pressure to further expand capacity, but was unable to solve a shortage of drivers. The difficulty in finding new drivers has been attributed to low wages and to federally mandated drug tests. Ridership of the North, South, and West lines reached 238,252 for the 2018–2019 time period. A new bus line dubbed \\"Snowstang\\" was announced in December 2019. It will ferry passengers from Denver to Arapahoe Basin, Loveland Ski Area and Steamboat Springs.

Description Cthulhu Classics is a 152-page perfect-bound softcover book written by Sandy Petersen, Scott David Aniolowski, John Carnahan, Scott Clegg, Ed Gore, David A. Hargrave, Marc Hutchison, Doug Lyons, Randy McCall, Mark Pettigrew, and Michael Szymanski, with eight color plates by Nick Smith and Tom Sullivan, and cover art by Lee Gibbons. Contents Cthulhu Classics is an anthology containing a previously published campaign and five previously published shorter adventures from the earlier Cthulhu Companion, Curse of the Cthonians, Shadows of Yog-Sothoth, and Terror from the Stars. These include: * \\"Shadows of Yog-Sothoth\\", the first Call of Cthulhu campaign published by Chaosium in 1982 — seven sequential adventures that pit Investigators against the Hermetic Order of the Silver Twilight, who are attempting to raise the lost city of R'lyeh from the depths of the Pacific Ocean, thereby unleashing the Elder God Cthulhu. * \\"The Warren\\" * \\"Dark Carnival\\" * \\"The Pits of Bendal-Dolum\\" * \\"Temple of the Moon\\" * \\"Secret of Castronegro\\", in which a New Mexico town is under the influence of a sinister force There are also several removable player handouts. Reception Stephan Wieck reviewed Cthulhu Classics for White Wolf #20, rating it 5 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\" If you have yet to play Shadows of Yog-Sothoth, then Cthulhu Classics is for you. The book will provide most gaming groups with at least six months worth of terror and SANity loss.\\" In the June 1990 edition of Dragon (Issue 158), Jim Bambra evaluated each of the included adventures. He called Shadows of Yog-Sothoth \\"good, but it is not as slickly written or plotted as [another Chaosium publication] Masks of Nyarlathotep; but he admitted that it contains \\"excellent scenes\\" where \\"horror elements are well presented.\\" Looking at the five shorter adventures, Bambra thought Secret of Castronegro was the best of the five. He called Dark Carnival and The Warren \\"serviceable\\". The remaining two, set in the jungle, were \\"too short on library research and investigation, and too high on unavoidable sanity-blasting horrors for my taste.\\" He concluded, \\"While I have reservations about some of the adventures, the inclusion of Shadows of Yog-Sothoth makes it worth buying. For those groups that don’t have time to undertake larger campaigns, the five short adventures will come in very handy.\\" Reviews *Games Review (Volume 2, Issue 8 - May 1990) References Category:Call of Cthulhu adventures ","title":"Cthulhu Classics"},{"id":"62439118","text":"The Headies Award for Producer of the Year is an award presented at The Headies, a ceremony that was established in 2006 and originally called the Hip Hop World Awards.

After unsuccessfully running for the Florida Senate in 2006, Jennings was appointed as the Regional Director for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. History Jennings was born in Gainesville and attended the University of Florida, where he served as the president of Florida Blue Key and the Black Student Union. Jennings graduated in 1993 with a bachelor's degree in political science, and helped his father, Edward Jennings, Sr., get elected to the Gainesville City Commission that year. Florida House of Representatives Following incumbent State Representative Cynthia M. Chestnut's inability to seek re-election, Jennings ran to succeed her in the 23rd District, which stretched from Gainesville to Ocala. He faced Harvey Budd, a former Alachua County Charter Review Commissioner and a member of the Gainesville Plan Board, in the Democratic primary. While both Budd and Jennings agreed in their opposition to Governor Jeb Bush's education policies and in their support of the University of Florida, Jennings campaigned on his support for increased economic development in the poorer, eastern parts of Gainesville and on creating a \\"Florida Triangle\\" between Gainesville, Ocala, and Jacksonville. Budd attacked Jennings for working as a real estate developer and for taking contributions from developers, but Jennings argued that he was an environmentally conscientious developer and had relevant experience. Ultimately, Jennings defeated Budd by a wide margin, winning 60–40%. In the general election, Jennings faced Dick Williams, a registered Democrat running as a No Party Affiliation candidate who served as the president of the local chapter of the AARP. Jennings continued to campaign on his proposal to reduce poverty by making investments in the area's infrastructure, and noted that his development company had built low-cost housing units in the eastern part of the district. Jennings beat Williams by a wide margin, receiving 76% of the vote to Williams's 24%, and won his first term in the House. In his 2002 and 2004 re-elections, Jennings faced only opposition from Libertarian candidates, and defeated both easily. He was opposed by Libertarian Brooks Nelson, a chemical analyst and the son of Dunedin Mayor Janet Henderson, who raised no money and didn't extensively campaign for the seat. Jennings and Nelson strongly disagreed on the issues, with Jennings staking out positions in support of affirmative action and protecting the state's social safety net and Nelson arguing against affirmative action and for broad tax cuts to shrink the size of government. Jennings won easily, defeating Nelson 78–22%, a slight improvement from his 2000 election. Similarly, in 2004, Jennings was opposed by Libertarian nominee Ray Roberts, and won a third and final term, 81–19%. 2006 State Senate campaign In 2006, rather than run for a fourth term to the State House, Jennings announced that he would run for the State Senate, seeking to replace incumbent Senator Rod Smith, who was retiring to run for Governor. In the Democratic primary, Jennings faced former State Representative Perry McGriff. Jennings campaigned on his experience and pro-family record in the legislature, his plan to provide health insurance to the uninsured through a private-public partnership, and his opposition to abortion restrictions. Ultimately, Jennings defeated McGriff by a fairly comfortable margin, prevailing 56–44%. Jennings carried Alachua County and Marion County by wide margins, narrowly won Columbia County and Putnam County, while narrowly losing the remaining rural counties to McGriff. In the general election, Jennings faced Alachua County Sheriff Steve Oelrich. Jennings campaigned on increasing the regulations on insurance companies to prevent property owners from losing coverage, adding trade and technical programs to schools, protecting the \\"limited essential services\\" provided by local governments, and increasing funding to education. The campaign quickly became negative, however, with Oelrich attacking Jennings's lack of legislative accomplishments, his support for \\"social programs and government intervention,\\" for supporting voting rights restoration for ex-felons. and for being delinquent in his property taxes. The race remained close until Election Day, with both Jennings and Oelrich saturating the district with television advertisements and mailers. Despite the district's Democratic lean, however, Oelrich ended up beating Jennings, winning 54–46%. Department of Housing and Urban Development In 2010, Jennings was appointed to serve as the Regional Director of Region IV at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, overseeing Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Then-HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said, \\"Today, we need to have people on our senior management team who have the experience to get the job done and I have no doubt, Ed Jennings is just such a person. The eight states that make up our Southeast Region will benefit enormously from his experience and I’m proud he’s answered the call to serve.\\" While serving at HUD, Jennings was named as a defendant brought by a bank over an unpaid loan, and reached a confidential settlement. The next year, Jennings came under fire for failing to adequately inspect an apartment complex and for unsanitary conditions experienced by a tenant at one of his properties.

A variant system on hit locations is covered, and there is a chapter on coroners and forensic pathology. Four full adventures are also included: * \\"The City in the Sea\\", which uses diving gear, mini-subs and an Atlantis-like underwater city * \\"Dreams Dark and Deadly\\" * \\"The Killer Out of Space\\" (involving a space shuttle that crashes in Kansas) * \\"The Evil Stars\\" encompasses death metal rock stars and bikers Reception In the October 1988 edition of Dragon (#138), Ken Rolston thought the introductory rationale for moving Call of Cthulhu up to the present day was a waste of ink — \\"We have already accepted the Cthulhu Mythos in spite of its shabby documentary trappings and will continue to accept it for the purposes of gaming because it’s so delightfully lurid and evil\\" — but he found the rest of the book \\"is going to make Cthulhu fans happy.\\" He called the information about new equipment and firearms \\"good stuff\\" that he \\"eagerly devoured\\". He also found the chapter on modern forensics \\"fascinating reading and a real help to GMs trying to add realistic touches to scenarios.\\" He called the first adventure, The City in the Sea, \\"a bit heavy-handed and linear\\", but found the second adventure, Dreams Dark and Deadly, \\"an excellent example of mystery role-playing in a horror context... As a model of mystery scenario design, and a classic horror/supernatural scenario, this is my pick of the lot.\\" The third adventure, The Killer Out of Space was judged to be \\"very good\\", but the open-ended finale of the fourth adventure, The Evil Stars, was \\"a disappointing weakness, since a detailed development of one of the possible endings could have been a guide and inspiration without railroading both plot and PCs toward a single conclusion.\\" Rolston concluded that \\"The rules and background essays for contemporary CoC role-playing are interesting and adequate... The adventures are either quite good or very, very good, and the presentation and development of scenario materials, player and GM background, and handout props and clues are up to Chaosium's highest standards.\\" In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '70s, Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"After 1984, Chaosium turned away from new Basic Role-Playing System (BRP) games, but they didn't stop creating new settings for their BRP rules. Later years instead brought new venues for their existing games — most notably for Call of Cthulhu, whose publications included: Cthulhu by Gaslight (1986), set in the Victorian Age; H.P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands (1986), set in a fantasy world; and Cthulhu Now (1987), set in the modern day.

The line operates every 16-20 minutes during weekday peak-hours only. Route K9 trips are roughly 28 minutes. Background Route K9 operates during the weekday peak-hours in both directions between Fort Totten station and the Food and Drug Administration. This route provides additional service for route K6 during the weekday peak-hours which operates only 14 stops Southbound and 11 stops northbound. Route K9 currently operates out of Bladensburg division. History Route K9 originally operated between Tamarack and Federal Triangle but was discontinued between the 1970s and 1980s. Route K9 was reincarnated and introduced as a brand new MetroExtra route on December 30, 2012, at the request of Prince George's County, MD, Montgomery County, MD, and the City of Takoma Park, to operate as a limited stop route during weekday peak-hours, between Fort Totten station and Northwest Park Apartments, parallel to route K6 along the New Hampshire Avenue corridor. K9 was created to relieve overcrowding problems on the K6 during weekday peak-hours and provide a much faster ride between the Fort Totten and Northwest Park Apartments. Route K9 was the first MetroExtra route introduced in Maryland since the J4 in 2002. The route would also become successful since its first day of service. 2013 Proposed Changes In 2013 during WMATA's FY2014 budget, WMATA proposed to extend route K9 to the White Oak Shopping Center and divert into the Food and Drug Administration building. WMATA also considered rerouting the K9 between New Hampshire Avenue & Eastern Avenue and Fort Totten station via Eastern Avenue and Riggs Road instead of via New Hampshire Avenue and North Capitol Street instead of operating alongside the K6. 2013 Changes On December 29, 2013, route K9 was extended north of its original terminus at Northwest Park Apartments, to the White Oak Food and Drug Administration building. K9 also no longer divert off of New Hampshire Avenue onto the intersections of Southampton Drive and Northampton Drive, and was to instead remain straight on New Hampshire Avenue and only serve the Northwest Park Apartments at adjacent Metrobus Stops along New Hampshire Avenue. Service was replaced by the K6 and Ride On. 2016 changes When the Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center opened on December 22, 2016, the K9 was rerouted, along with several other Metrobus, Ride On buses, Shuttle UM and TheBus routes, to serve the newly opened Transit Center. Route K9 would serve Bus Bay A alongside the K6. Long Term Proposals Proposals that were mentioned towards the K9 are the following when both capital and operating funding is available: * Extending the K9 to White Oak Transit Center to operate alongside route K6 and to revive crowding on the Z6 and Z8. This requires a capital investment in a new bus (about $750,000) as well as additional funds to pay for the operation and maintenance of the bus (about $150,000 annually). * Add dedicated bus lanes, transit signal priority, signal re-timing, as well as new payment options, real-time bus arrival displays, and improved and fully accessible bus stops and shelters for the K9. 2020 Proposed Changes During WMATA's FY2021 budget year proposal, WMATA proposed to raise the MetroExtra fare from $2.00 to $3.00 at all times. However, WMATA also proposed to add weekday midday service to route K9. Later in September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route K9 service due to low federal funding. Route K9 has not operated since March 17, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is a black solid which slowly decomposes in moist air. It was first reported in 1838 by Carl Ernst Claus and its structure was determined first in 2018.  Structure  The structure of Cu(SCN)2 was determined via powder X-ray diffraction and consists of chains of Cu(NCS)2 linked together by weak Cu-S-Cu bonds into two-dimensional layers. It can be considered a Jahn-Teller distorted analogue of the mercury thiocyanate structure-type. Each copper is octahedrally coordinated by four sulfurs and two nitrogens. The sulfur end of the SCN- ligand is doubly bridging.  Synthesis  Copper(II) thiocyanate can be prepared from the reaction of concentrated solutions of copper(II) and a soluble thiocyanate salt in water, precipitating as a black powder. With rapid drying, pure Cu(SCN)2 can be isolated. Reaction at lower concentrations and for longer periods of time generates instead copper(I) thiocyanate.

It was established on 4 April 1946. Since 31 March 2009, the chairman of the DECR is Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev).  History   Creation  On 20 September 1918, the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church \\"for the sake of resolving difficulties on the path to unity and to possibly facilitate [...] the achievement of the ultimate goal\\" (that is, restoring unity and communication) instructed the Synod to form a standing commission under the Synod with branches in Russia and far abroad to interact with non-Eastern-Orthodox churches. However, it was not possible to establish that Commission. On 4 April 1946, by decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Department for external church relations was formed and had as its goal \\"the management of foreign institutions of the Russian Orthodox Church (dioceses, parishes, exarchates, metropolitan districts, spiritual missions, etc.; relations with autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches; correspondence with foreign institutions; processing of foreign correspondence: translation into Russian, preparation of answers, preparation of archival and scientific references; preparation of reports on all fundamental issues arising in connection with the management of foreign institutions, the relationship of the Russian Church with other autocephalous Churches and the leadership of non-Eastern-Orthodox religions\\".

This situation is unique in the whole history of the church throughout the world: the key role in the activities of the Church belonged to the department of external relations, which normally should occupy the most modest place. Today, the DECR, of course, is not the same, but the general veil of \\"special status\\" remains. In the second half of the 1940s, the Department was allocated colossal funds to carry out numerous contacts with the Middle Eastern patriarchates and churches of Europe, including non-Eastern-Orthodox (for example, Anglican). In addition, it was given a large-scale task: to create an anti-Vatican block.\\" The work to strengthen the department in 1960-1961 was carried out by the under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, \\"fulfilling the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU of July 25, 1960.\\"Письмо председателя Совета по делам Русской православной церкви В.

Its stem is stiff and grow to be about 2–4 feet tall with leaves that are small and lance shaped. The petals are a white or light pink color with dark pink or purple scattered spots. Its anthers are large and a yellow to orange color. The flowers and bulbs of this species can be used for medicinal purposes.  Distribution  The species is found in the Himalayas at elevations of 1,800-3,700 m. L. polyphyllum is hardly present in China, but is restricted to the northern region of a few countries: Tibet, Nepal, Pakistan, and the Wanga Valley in the northwestern Himalaya Mountains. It is specifically found in the Hunza Valley of Pakistan, which borders four countries: Russia, Afghanistan, China, and India. In India, this species is limited to three states where there are few wild habitats and a narrow number of lilies: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.  History  The white Himalayan lily was discovered by Dr. Royle in 1839 in northern India. In 1871, this species first flowered at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. Two years later, G. Maw was the first person to flower this lily in England. An issue of \\"The Garden\\" published an article on January 24, 1874 where the writer noted that L. polyphyllum flowers in June at an elevation of 6,500 feet. No photographs had existed until more than thirty-eight years after it was discovered. In the early 1900s, Elgin T. Gates found this species in the northern region of Pakistan at an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level in the Hunza valley. In 1974, an Indian journalist noted that it flowered in India in June at an elevation of 2,100 meters.

In addition to the embassy, Indonesia has two consulate generals in Frankfurt and Hamburg. The first Indonesian ambassador to West Germany was Alexander Andries Maramis (1953–1956). The first Indonesian ambassador to East Germany was Suparman who was appointed in 1975. The current ambassador to Germany, Arief Havas Oegroseno, was appointed by President Joko Widodo on 20 February 2018.  History  Diplomatic relations between Indonesia and West Germany were established in 1952. At that time, a Permanent Representative Office and consulate were initially established in Bonn. This office was elevated to embassy level in 1954. A consulate was also opened in West Berlin. In East Germany, a Permanent Representative Office was established in East Berlin in 1973, which was elevated to embassy level in 1976. After the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the Indonesian government sought to consolidate its diplomatic missions in the former two countries of East Germany and West Germany. On 17 January 1991, the embassy in the former East Berlin and the consulate in the former West Berlin were closed. In turn, a consulate general was established in the newly unified Berlin.Keputusan Presiden Nomor 2 Tahun 1991 tentang Perwakilan Republik Indonesia untuk Republik Federal Jerman [Presidential Decree No. 2 in 1991 regarding Representation of the Republic of Indonesia to the Federal Republic of Germany] (in Indonesian). Retrieved 2019-11-26. The embassy in Bonn thus became the main diplomatic mission of Indonesia in the unified Germany. However, when the capital of Germany moved from Bonn to Berlin in 1999, the Indonesian embassy also moved to Berlin. Subsequently, the consulate general in Berlin was moved to Frankfurt. The chancery in Bonn has been located in two separate locations. Until 1979, the chancery was located at Kurt-Schumacher-Straße (formerly named Drachenfelsstraße). In 1980, a new chancery was built at Bernkasteler Straße 2 and was used until the embassy moved to Berlin. After the embassy moved to Berlin, the Indonesian government kept ownership of the building at Bernkasteler Straße 2. It eventually was put up for sale in 2016. In 2019, the Indonesian government started plans to build a new chancery that would replace the chancery at the current location on Lehrter Strasse in Berlin. The new chancery would be built on a site that the government bought in Tiergarten, Berlin's diplomatic enclave.

The species was named by the German biologist Theodor Hartig, in 1840 and is found in Europe. Description of the gall Adults lay their eggs on various species of oak, including Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), Lusitanian oak (Quercus lusitanica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), downy oak (Quercus pubescens), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra). Like many oak gall wasps, there are two generations per cycle, with one sexual and one asexual, each creating different galls. The sexual gall is a club-like swelling at the tip of the shoot. Green at first, later becoming the same colour of the twig. The buds and twig develop as normal above the gall, which can persist for years, and growth of the twig can also continue for years. The female lays her eggs on a bud, especially on buds sprouting straight from the trunk. The asexual gall is a small, green, egg-shaped swelling in the leaf brachium. It is up to 6 mm long, often with a distinct point. They can be found from September to November and when mature drop to the ground. ;Similar species * At the tip of a twig the swelling of Andricus curvator has an interior cavity that is spherical or oval, compared with the sexual gall of A inflator where the interior is long and narrow * Andricus quercusramuli is egg-shaped, smaller than the asexual gall of A. inflator, up to 3.5 mm long and also matures in the autumn. * Andricus infectorius asexual gall is similar with a 10–20 mm swelling when mature in October, falling from the tree during the winter. The colour varies from green to dark brown as it matures. Distribution The wasp is found in Europe from Ireland to the Ukraine.

The team plays in the Accra Basketball League (ABL). It is the basketball team of the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS), Ghana's customs organization. Established in 2018, the team won the ABL championship in 2018 and 2019. In October 2019, Braves played in the qualifying tournaments for the Basketball Africa League. Honours Accra Basketball League *Winners (1): 2018, 2019 The Braves is the best basketball team in Ghana. They gave a lot of players the opportunity to enjoy the game of basketball and even give employment to many players till date. The Ghana Customs (BRAVES) primary goal was to pick the best players from other teams and make them part of their agenda. This extreme ideology was under the coach Mr. Dawson. But then again there were many critics of this agenda saying if you take the best players from other teams to make up the Braves there will not be any competition in the country. They were right. The Braves have been in control of Ghana basketball for about two decades. They were unstoppable. They played many teams in Nigeria, Togo, Benin, and Ivory Coast. In addition to what the coach at that time had in mind, he also want the Braves to represent Ghana National Team. This is where the bias was out on the open. It also put pressure on the opposing players to be part of the Braves. There was a unique name that stood out in the Braves organization. The name was Captain Baafi. He was the soul of not just the braves of CEPS but the entire basketball in Ghana. He helps players to be their best. He always advise players even in the opposing team to be their best and work hard if they want to see Ghana on the high level. One thing he stands for is to make sure Ghana basketball move to the next level. And before we can do that and I quote \\" we need to have an indoor basketball.\\" The talent is there just like he said, but playing on a hard concrete? Good luck. His message was simple and straightforward, support the players. He tried all his best to make sure Ghana basketball is on the level of Nigeria, Morocco, Mali, Angola and many others. But his effort was cut short by his sudden demise. However, if there is anything to say about Ghana basketball we have to give credit to one of the best coaches in the country by name Mr. Ocloo who is the architect of the dreamers. He made players. meaning he start coaching players from when they have no idea about basketball, to bouncing and taking three pointers. He raised players like Quaye alias Rubberman, Commando, and many others who later became members of CEPS. Another coach that deserve praise is Albert Donkor popularly known as STONE from NIMA FLAMES. He was one of the point guards in Ghana that were unstoppable. He coached many players like Alhaji, Sulley, Yussif, Obuobi, George, Mazzola Jr. and Sr. and many others who ended up joining CEPS. As much as Ghana basketball need some changes we can not ignore the fact that CEPS should not be counted out for their achievements. Whether good or bad they were able to give employment to many college graduate who had no means of getting employment anywhere. we will hope sooner or later the dreams of Mr Baafi will come to fruition.

The series ended in 1998, with five tankōbon volumes being released. It was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Viz Media in 2000, first serialized in Viz's manga magazine Animerica Extra and later published in five trade paperback volumes from 2002 to 2004. Viz re-released the series in a two-volume hardcover box set on April 11, 2017. Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Adolescence of Utena A manga adaptation of the 1999 film Adolescence of Utena written and illustrated by Saito was serialized from May to September 1999 in the manga magazine Bessatsu Shōjo Comic Special. While the manga is not a one-to-one adaptation of the film, it broadly incorporates its major plot points; Saito has commented that she regards the manga as a more direct story, while the film is more thematic and abstract. As the manga was published in a special edition of Bessatsu Shōjo Comic aimed at a josei audience (older teenage girls and adult women), it maintains a more mature tone relative to the original Revolutionary Girl Utena manga and anime. An English-language translation of the manga licensed by Viz Media was serialized in Animerica Extra before being published as a collected volume by Viz on November 11, 2004. Revolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution On May 20, 2017, Shogakukan announced that the first chapter of an Utena sequel series written and illustrated by Saito, Revolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution, would be published in the September issue of its monthly josei manga magazine Flowers. Two additional chapters were published in the March and May 2018 issues. Released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of the anime series, After the Revolution depicts the lives of the primary cast 20 years after the events of the original series.

She was raised in Kwamashu, G Section, KwaZulu-Natal by her grandparents Joshua Bhekokwakhe Maphumulo, a political activist, and Agnes Ntombizodwa Maphumulo, a maid and seamstress. Because of the political unrest in the country and her grandfather's involvement in the struggle, Thenjiwe frequently changed from one school to another. She completed her secondary education at Northmead Secondary School and later joined Natal Technical College (Natal Teknikon) which is now Durban University of Technology where she graduated in Performing Arts in 1998.

She later relocated to the United Kingdom, living there for 12 years, during which time she studied Law, graduating first from University of London with a Diploma in Law in 2006 and then later a Bachelor of Laws from the London Metropolitan University in 2009.

This opened doors for more opportunities to perform in South Africa. But the five-minute slots she was being offered could not financially justify frequently flying from the United Kingdom. Having been disrespected as a woman comedian, Thenjiwe decided to use social media to promote her content. In February 2015, she joined YouTube, subsequently posting comedy video sketches which made her famous. Between 2015 and 2016, she appeared as a guest comedian in the Season 1 of Bantu Hour on SABC 2.

Early life and education  Born into a conservative family, she obtained her Masters from Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College, Tiruchirapalli in 1974 and joined the Department of Theoretical Physics. In 1982, she completed a Ph.D from Madras University, and soon met and married T. Jayaram.  Career  B. Vijayalakshmi's studies explored the topics of relativistic equations of higher spin in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, looking for ways higher spin theories could be constructed. Soon after she worked on spinning particle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. It was around 1978 when the Association of Research Scholars of the Madras University was formed and was contributed to by B. Vijayalakshmi. In 1980 she gave talks at the biannual High Energy Physics Symposium of the Department of Atomic Energy held at the University in Kochi. She was treated with high regard after this and respect for her studies. Although her health deteriorated due to cancer she published five publications on the relativistic wave equations in external fields and completed her requirements for Ph.D., describing large classes of relativistic equations previously unknown to the scientific community. As supersymmetry became more popular her work shifted and she wrote two papers on the topic. For more than two more years B. was studying relativistic equations from different angles.  Personal life  After meeting her husband, and marrying in 1978, B. Vijayalakshmi slowly became more involved in communist left movements as time would allow, with her beliefs shifting into atheism. It was during her studies in quantum mechanics that she was diagnosed with widespread stomach and abdominal cancer, eventually keeping her to a wheelchair, but persisted with her work.

In 1903, she became the first person to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Toronto, and one of the first two women to earn a Ph.D. from that institution (the other being chemist Clara Benson).  Biography  Baker was born in Milton, Ontario, in 1856. She attended Newmarket High School in Newmarket; Toronto Normal School; and Albert College, in Belleville. She taught and served as a principal at a number of girls' schools, including Dickenson's Seminary (now Lycoming College) in Pennsylvania, and Presbyterian Ladies' College in Toronto. For her Ph.D. in philosophy (psychology was considered a subdiscipline of philosophy at the time), Baker worked under the supervision of August Kirschmann, a German-born psychologist who led the psychology laboratory at the University of Toronto. In the laboratory, Baker conducted experiments on the aesthetics of colours. She published two of her experiments in the laboratory's in-house publication, called the University of Toronto Studies, Psychological Series: first, “Experiments on the aesthetic of light and colour: On combinations of two colours,\\" and second, “Experiments on the aesthetic of light and colour: Spectrally pure colours in binary combinations.\\" Baker's doctoral dissertation consisted of the two reports. She was awarded her Ph.D. in 1903.

He is known for his landscapes and street scenes with atmospheric skies. Early life Born to a wealthy family in Gilly, Belgium in 1870, Léonard Misonne was one of many children of Adèle Pirmez and lawyer and industrialist Louis Misonne. He studied Greek and humanities in Charleroi before going to the Université catholique de Louvain where he got a degree in mining engineering. However, he did not become a mining engineer in the long term. Photography Returning from the market, 1910s Misonne is best known for his atmospheric photographs of landscapes and street scenes, with light as a key feature, and as a pioneer of pictorialism. According to the Directory of Belgian Photographers, \\"Misonne’s work is characterised by a masterly treatment of light and atmospheric conditions. His images express poetic qualities, but sometimes slip into an anecdotal sentimentality.\\" He was nicknamed \\"the Corot of photography\\". Misonne devoted himself to photography from 1896, joining the Belgian Photography Association in 1897. He became a leading light in pictorialism, frequently exhibiting his photographs at exhibitions. He also did slide shows. Much of his photography was in Belgium and the Netherlands, but he also visited London, France, Germany and Switzerland. The German occupation of Belgium during World War II greatly restricted his photography. Techniques Misonne would often photograph things that were strongly illuminated from behind, producing a halo effect. He would also retouch the lighting effects in his photographs, experimenting with and using many techniques, such as the Fresson process and later the bromoil and mediobrome processes. He also invented the \\"flou-net\\" and \\"photo-dessin\\" processes. Quotes Personal life Misonne married Louise Valentine Lambin in 1906, and they had several children. He supported himself with the family fortune. Misonne was a keen cyclist, winning some races. Misonne suffered severely from asthma throughout his life, and died in Gilly in 1943.

After the expulsion of Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government executed stabilization measurements and initiated market reform program. Serbia rejoined the World Bank and renewed its membership in the International Monetary Fund in the December of 2000. Between the years 2001 and 2008, the World Bank provided funds for 32 projects in Serbia with the combined cost of over $1 billion aimed to improve Serbia’s banking, education, energy, public finance, and social sectors. The WBG contributed to the privatization of several state and socially-owned companies, assisted in the modernization of frontier passages, reformation of the judiciary system, road reconstruction, addressed improvement environment, health, and employment services. The current Serbia's World Bank Portfolio includes 13 projects in the areas of transport, real estate management/business environment, competitiveness and jobs, health, flood recovery and flood protection, disaster risk management, financial sector reform, public sector modernization (including the digitalization of selected public services and the modernization of tax administration), and early childhood education.  Projects   Corridor X Highway  The Corridor X (Highlighted in red) With a total cost of $448 million, the Corridor X is the largest World bank project in Serbia, which commitment to the project is $60 million, while the rest is provided by IBRD. The purpose of the Corridor X Highway Project is to enhance the capability of traffic transit, increase safety on each part of three sections of corridor X. The highway lies between Nis and Dimitrovgrad and Leskovac (Grabovnica) and Donji Neradovac. Corridor X includes both railroad and motor highway. It is a portion of the Pan-European network to expedite the connectivity with other parts of Serbia and other European countries. It is vital for Serbia’s competitiveness and allows conjunction with the center of Europe, Greece, and Asia. By the year 2020, the railway part of the corridor will allow trains to travel with a speed of 120–200 km/h. With the total length of 803 kilometers, Corridor X is the least line from Central Europe to Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East.  Education Improvement Project  With the total cost of US$12.17 million, the purpose of the Republic of Serbia Education Improvement Project is to assist the Serbian government in implementing practical education amelioration. The four segments of the project include: * improvement grants to 650 basic and 50 general secondary schools. * establishment of a contemporary internationally acknowledged system for assessment and examinations * develop effective management and allocation of financial resources * promote decentralization of education As a part of the project, 1684 primary and secondary schools in Serbia was trained in developing school plans. The participation of local communities helped to distinguish problems and ways to address them. A conducted study showed that 80% of the participants were satisfied with the opportunity to undergo the training. As a result, the Serbian government implemented a law to make it imperative for all schools to prepare school development plans.

It is located in an area known as the Kemerton Industrial Park. The location had been considered as being Kemerton, in the 1980s as a potential aluminium smelter location, but is now considered to be part of Wellesley. The consideration of the site as being appropriate as a power station site was being considered in the early 2000s. It is rated at 300 MW using two Siemens open cycle gas turbine generators powered by natural gas. It operates as a peaking plant and provides electricity into the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). When it was built in 2005, it was rated at 260.9 MW, and received an upgrade to the current capacity in June 2008. When gas is not available, the power station can also operate on fuel oil. Gas is supplied to the Kemerton Power Station via a 4.94 km lateral branch from the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. The branch line is a 300 mm diameter steel pipe with 6.4 mm wall thickness. Kemerton power station also has four 1.25 MW diesel generators completed in October 2018. These are used in a contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide the capability for a black start on the SWIS if needed.

Description  Mithrodia bradleyi in the Gulf of California Bradley's sea star has five arms that are banded in lighter and darker shades of red or red-brown. The disk is small. The arms are covered with many small bumps and fewer, more prominent spines. The spines are arranged in rows, including a row that runs right along the top of each arm, and typically two more rows that run the length of the arms on either side. The arms are rounded, almost circular in cross-section. The sea star can obtain a diameter of .

Managed by the RCMP, it provide matches to convicted offenders and offer a memory repository for cold cases.  History  The first DNA analysis in Canada for investigative purposes was in April of 1989. The RCMP utilized the method to aid in the investigation of a sexual assault in Ottawa, Ontario. The suspect in the case denied allegations made by the victim. Subsequent use of DNA forensic analysis confirmed the suspect to be the perpetrator. In 1995, Bill C-104 was unanimously passed by the parliament. This enabled provincial court judges to issue police warrants for obtaining biological samples from suspects in a criminal investigation. In 1998, the DNA Identification Act was enacted by the parliament. The Act established a new law governing the creation and administration of a national DNA database. It updated the Criminal Code to allow a judge to authorize collection of bodily substances from a person found guilty of designated offences. Same year, after the Swissair Flight 111 disaster, a special DNA typing task force led by the RCMP used the technology to help identify human remains. In 2000, National DNA Data Bank was officially launched. The legislation enabled this time, allowed military judges to make post-conviction DNA data bank orders.  National Missing Persons DNA Program  National Missing Persons DNA Program (NMPDP) is an initiative established by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2018 to support missing persons and unidentified remains investigations.

Canham, was an American journalist and author; best known for his work as the longest serving editor of the Christian Science Monitor. He also was the last Resident Commissioner of the Northern Mariana Islands, and was very active in various civic, political, and journalistic activities. Early Life Canham grew up in Maine, where, when he was as young as 8 years old, he began helping his father run a small newspaper in Sanford. He attended high- school in Auburn, Maine. In 1925 Canham graduated from Bates College, where was captain of the debating team and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and he joined the Christian Science Monitor the same year. Career Soon after starting work at the Monitor, Canham took leave to earn his bachelor's and master's degrees at Oriel College, Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship, covering the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland for the Monitor on breaks, where he made a significant impression and built a long list of contacts. After finishing up at Oxford in 1928, Canham was put in charge of the Monitor's Geneva bureau. He wrote about international affairs in the company of other Monitor correspondents such as Roscoe Drummond, William Henry Chamberlin and Reuben H. Markham. He stayed there until 1932 when he returned to the United States to head up the Washington, D.C. bureau. In 1939, Canham returned to Boston as a general news editor. Roscoe Drummond, a close friend of Canham's who replaced him as head of the Monitor's Washington bureau, gave Canham the nickname \\"Spike\\" because it was \\"the most incongruous one\\" he could think of for Canham's personality, since he was \\"such a scholarly type.\\" In Boston, Canham worked under editor Roland Harrison until taking over as chief editor in 1941, although under the title managing editor until 1944. In this position he had significant influence on how the Monitor covered World War II. Canham became the Monitor's longest-serving editor, assuming the title editor- in-chief in 1964, and in 1974, retiring and being named editor emeritus. During that time he reported on many major world events, including the founding of NATO and the United Nations, where he acted as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.The papers of Erwin D. Canham, editor of The Christian Science Monitor The Mary Baker Eddy Library. Besides his work at the Monitor, Canham was involved in other civic and professional activities and organizations. He served as president and board chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and president of the board of trustees of the Boston Public Library. He also served on the Bates College board of trustees, was a member of President Richard Nixon's Commission on Campus Unrest, and served as chair of the National Manpower Commission under the Eisenhower administration, and on an advisory commission to the U.S. Information Agency. In 1955, Canham helped mediate a cell block takeover at the Charlestown Prison. He was asked, along with six other men whom the prisoners respected, to listen to their story and see their living conditions. In the end, the hostages which the prisoners had taken were released. Canham later called the experience one of the most meaningful in his life. Resident Commissioner In 1975, Canham accepted an assignment by the United States government to oversee a referendum in which residents voted to withdraw from the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. He then was appointed as the last Resident Commissioner of the Northern Marianas Islands from 1975 to 1978. Afterwards, Canham kept his home in Saipan, often traveling between there and Massachusetts, and remained active in journalism and other activities.(January 8, 1982). Tribute Paid to Canham's Memory. Marianas Variety He underwent abdominal surgery at Guam Memorial Hospital two weeks before his passing on January 3, 1982. At the time, he had been working on a book describing the history of the Northern Marianas Islands. His remains were interred in Guam. Legacy Canham advocated for honesty and ethics in journalism. The Monitor won its first Pulitzer Prizes under Canham's leadership. While he was editor, \\"the Monitor was considered by most media critics as one of the most respected and influential publications in the country. It was especially lauded for its national and international reporting as well as for its writing style and typographical excellence\\" according to the Washington Post. The Marianas Variety wrote that \\"[in] a political atmosphere often charged with acrimony and pettiness, he managed to remain fair, objective and untainted by narrow partisanship.\\"Liepman, Kurt (January 8, 1982).

Life  Krishna Ahooja-Patel was born in 1929 as the eldest of five siblings in the North Indian Amritsar. The family believed in Sikhism and Hinduism. Her mother stayed home and her father was a progressive businessman. In 1942, the family moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) where, as a 13-year-old student, Krishna heard a speech by Mahatma Gandhi whose ideas deeply impressed her. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of Aligarh (U.P.), India. From 1947 to 1962, Ahooja-Patel lived in the UK, where she studied law and worked for the BBC.

The collection was first published by the People's Publishing House in 1951, and was later translated into English by the state-owned Foreign Languages Press. A fifth volume, which included the works of Chairman Mao from 1949–1957, was released during the leadership of Hua Guofeng, but subsequently withdrawn from circulation for its perceived ideological errors.Adler, Sol. \\"A Talk on the Translation of Volume V of Chairman Mao's Selected Works.\\" 中国翻译 1 (1980): 6.

During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the People's Publishing House published 870 different editions of Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung (Volumes 1-4), with a total of 325 million paperbacks and 2.55 million hardcover copies of the Chinese editions created. The Selected Works were also translated into a 14 different foreign languages.  History  After the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong Thought became part of the guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China. During the Chinese Civil War, various Communist Party-controlled areas published unofficial anthologies of Mao Zedong. It is estimated that 21 unauthorized versions of the Selected Works were published.著 海萍 ， 张云燕 编 著.单 的 书 单. ：: 新华 出版社. 2014.12: 208. . In 1951, when Mao Zedong visited the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin suggested that Mao Zedong publish his anthology. In May 1950, the Politburo of the Communist Party of China formally decided to establish the Mao Zedong Anthology Editorial Committee, with Liu Shaoqi as its director. The specific editing work was led by Chen Boda , assisted by Hu Qiaomu and Tian Jiaying, and all compiled manuscripts were revised and authorized for publication by Mao Zedong himself. The five officially published volumes of the Selected Works include most of the important works by Mao Zedong between the years 1926 to 1949. The first volume covers the period of 1926 to 1936 with selections related to the revolutionary civil wars in China. The second volume begins with the philosophical work by Mao, On Contradiction and contains writings from the years 1937 to 1938 related to the war against Japan. Selections discussing military strategy against both the Japanese and the Kuomintang are the subject of the third volume of the selected works, which contains selections from writings released between the years 1939 and 1940. The fourth volume covers the writings of Mao from the years 1941 to 1945, continuing the discussion of Chinese resistance to the Japanese. The fifth and final official publication is a selection of writings from the years 1945 to 1949 related to the final years of the Chinese civil war and the founding of the People's Republic of China. Each volume of the Selected Works includes detailed notes referencing the historical context of each selection included in the volumes.  Volume Information  {  - ! Volume !! Subject Range !!

After the publication, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China set up a translation room for Mao Zedong's works, which translated the Selected Works four volumes into a variety of foreign languages for publication. Since then, the translation room has gradually developed into the Document Translation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party . In addition to the four-volume edition, there is also a four-volume \\"one volume\\".  Volume 5  A fifth book was planned as early as 1960, to include selected writings from the PRC period, but Chairman Mao resisted its production as he felt his essays and speeches on Socialist Construction (1949-1957) were still evolving compared to the views contained in the earlier volumes. The fifth volume of the Selected Works included 70 articles by Mao Zedong after the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was formally published and distributed by People's Publishing House on April 15, 1977, with a price of 1.25 yuan. The compilation and editing of this volume took ten years due to the Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong's opposition to the publication of a fifth volume of his works. Hua Guofeng insisted on the publication of the fifth volume of the Selected Works.

A member of the Republican Party, Loeffler previously served as chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of commodity and financial service provider Intercontinental Exchange, which is owned by her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher. She is also co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). On December 4, 2019, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp selected Loeffler as the successor to Senator Johnny Isakson, who announced his intention to resign at the end of 2019 for health reasons. She was sworn into office on January 6, 2020. Loeffler is running in the special Senate election to take place in late 2020. Early life and career Loeffler was born in Bloomington, Illinois, and raised on her family's corn and soybean farm in Stanford, Illinois. In 1988, she graduated from Olympia High School in Stanford, where she was in marching band, ran cross country and track, and played varsity basketball. In 1992, Loeffler graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Gies College of Business, where she was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority. After college, she worked for Toyota as a District Account Manager. In 1999, Loeffler graduated with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in international finance and marketing from DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business. She financed her graduate school tuition by mortgaging land inherited from her grandparents. After earning her MBA, Loeffler worked for Citibank, William Blair & Company, and the Crossroads Group. In 2002, Loeffler joined Intercontinental Exchange, a commodity and financial service provider, in investor relations. After marrying the firm's CEO, Jeffrey Sprecher, in 2004, a courtship Sprecher described as her biggest risk \\"because if it didn't work out, she'd be on the short end of the stick,\\" she was eventually promoted to senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. In 2018, Loeffler became the chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange. In 2010, Loeffler bought a minority stake in the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). In 2011, she and Mary Brock purchased the team from Kathy Betty. Loeffler took an active role in the team, arranging her travel schedule to attend all games and often meeting with head coach Michael Cooper during halftime to analyze the first half of the game.  Political donations  According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, have donated $3.2 million to political committees. Most of these donations have gone to the Republican Party, but some have gone to Democrats, including Representative David Scott (GA–13), who received $10,200. Loeffler donated $750,000 to Restore Our Future, a Super PAC supporting former Governor Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. The National Republican Senatorial Committee received $247,500 from Loeffler and her husband. In May 2020, Sprecher gave $1 million to a Trump 2020 reelection super PAC. It was Sprecher's largest ever federal political donation. U.S. Senate Loeffler considered seeking the Republican nomination in the 2014 United States Senate election in Georgia but ultimately passed on the race because of Intercontinental Exchange's pending acquisition with the New York Stock Exchange. Appointment Loeffler meeting with Mitch McConnell in December 2019 Vice President Mike Pence In November 2019, Loeffler applied to succeed incumbent Senator Johnny Isakson, who had announced his resignation from the United States Senate, effective December 31, for health reasons. She is running in the 2020 special election for the remainder of Isakson's term. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Loeffler was Governor Brian Kemp's choice for the seat, and on December 4 he announced that he would appoint her when the seat became vacant. Loeffler was sworn into the Senate on January 6, 2020. 2020 Senate election Loeffler is running to serve the remaining two years of Isakson's term. She plans to spend $20 million of her own money on her campaign. She is the first female senator in 97 years to represent Georgia in the Senate and first Republican woman to do so. Under Georgia's election law, all candidates for the seat (regardless of political party) will compete in a nonpartisan blanket primary. If no candidate wins over 50% of the vote, the top two finishers will participate in a runoff election in January. Among others, Loeffler faces U.S. Representative Doug Collins, a Republican who represents Georgia's 9th congressional district and gained attention as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee. Loeffler's candidacy is backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, as well as several senior Senate Republicans. In a July 2020 letter to the WNBA, Loeffler, who owns the Atlanta Dream, suggested that players wear American flags on their jerseys rather than planned warm-up shirts with \\"Black Lives Matter\\" printed on them. She stated her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying, \\"The statement 'Black lives matter' is very different than the organization Black Lives Matter. There's a political organization called Black Lives Matter that I think is very important to make the distinction between their aim and where we are as a country at this moment.\\" She opposed the WNBA's plans to honor the movement and said that honoring Black Lives Matter \\"undermines the potential of the sport and sends a message of exclusion\\" and that the organization has advocated \\"defunding and abolishing the police, abolishing our military, emptying our prisons, destroying the nuclear family. It promotes violence and antisemitism.\\" Her comments led some WNBA players to call for her removal from ownership. In August 2020, players from the Dream and several other teams in the league wore \\"Vote Warnock\\" t-shirts in support of one of Loeffler's Democratic challengers in the special election. In October 2020, shortly after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending events where he closely interacted with other individuals while maskless, Loeffler blamed his diagnosis on China. She tweeted, \\"China gave this virus to our President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady @FLOTUS. WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\\" Tenure ;Committee assignments Loeffler serves on the following committees: * Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry ** Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management and Trade ** Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry and Natural Resources ** Subcommittee on Livestock, Marketing and Agriculture Security * Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions * Committee on Veterans' Affairs * Joint Economic Committee ;Caucuses *Senate Republican Conference  Stock trading  On March 19, 2020, the public release of federal financial disclosure documents showed that Loeffler and her husband, chairman and CEO of International Exchange, the corporation that owns the New York Stock Exchange, Jeffrey Sprecher, had sold stock in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic with an aggregate value of several million dollars. Loeffler denied any wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by a third-party advisor and that she learned about them only after they occurred. The disclosures included that between January 24 and February 14, the couple sold between $1.275 and $3.1 million worth of stock in 27 companies, while buying stocks worth between $450,000 and $1 million, including in Citrix, a collaboration software company. On March 20, 2020, the government watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee for possible violations of the STOCK Act and insider trading laws in the matter of stock sales by Loeffler and two other Republican senators, Richard Burr and James Inhofe, along with Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein. On April 1, it was reported that Loeffler and Sprecher had sold at least $18.7 million in Intercontinental Exchange stock before the 2020 stock market crash. On April 8, The Wall Street Journal reported that Loeffler and Sprecher would be selling individual stocks in an effort \\"to move beyond the distraction\\" caused by trades they made before and during the market decline caused by the novel coronavirus. On May 26, the Department of Justice announced that it had closed its inquiry into Loeffler. Political positions Loeffler describes herself as a conservative Republican. She supports the reelection of President Donald Trump. As of July 2020, Loeffler has voted in line with Trump's stated position on legislative issues 100% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. Loeffler opposes abortion and has said she will vote for anti-abortion legislation. Although the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List initially opposed Loeffler's appointment, it endorsed her in the 2020 election. Loeffler has said she supports gun owners' Second Amendment rights, constructing a border wall along the Mexico–United States border, and the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts. Personal life Loeffler is a Roman Catholic. In 2004, she married Intercontinental Exchange founder and CEO Jeffrey Sprecher. They live in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta, in a $10.5 million, estate named Descante, bought in the most expensive residential real estate transaction ever recorded in Atlanta.

She is the Charles Horace Mayo Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Director of the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute and chief of the Division of Nephrology. Early life and education Quaggin attended Branksome Hall, where she met her future husband Kevin Smith who attended Royal St. George's College. She attended the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, where she received the Carl W. Gottschalk Research Scholar Award from the American Society of Nephrology, and completed her post-doctoral fellowship at the Yale School of Medicine. In 1997, Quaggin returned to Toronto to study developmental biology with Janet Rossant at the Lunenfeld Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital. It was during her lab research with Rossant that she discovered a gene critical for the development of the kidneys, heart and lungs. By 2000, Quaggin and her research team were cloning mice lacking that vital gene in order to study their kidneys. The next year, she received the Joe Doupe Young Investigator Award. Career Quaggin accepted a faculty position at the University of Toronto, where she would spend 13 years as a senior scientist at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, a nephrologist at St. Michael’s Hospital, and the Gabor-Zellerman Professor in renal medicine. In 2006, she was named a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Vascular Biology, which granted her $500,000 over 5 years. Two years later, Quaggin and Laura Barison discovered that VEGF inhibitors, an antibody used to treat many forms of cancer, was causing renal failure. She was also elected Chair for the Abstract Selection Committees for Glomerular Disease with the American Society of Nephrology. The next year, Quaggin was the recipient of the 2009 KFOC Medal for Research Excellence by the Kidney Foundation of Canada. In 2011, Quaggin was appointed the Gabor-Zellerman Chair in Renal Research in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto and Deputy Editor and for Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

The disease is found in blueberry plants in many regions of North America, as well as South America, Europe, New Zealand, and South Africa. Within these regions the virus is most often found in high blueberry-yielding areas, but can be spread to other locations. Blueberry mosaic associated ophiovirus is one of seven species in the genus Ophiovirus. It is a member of the Aspiviridae family, in the Serpentovirales order, and in the Milnevircetes class. The Ophioviridae viruses are characterized by a flexible and elongated nucleocapsid that is composed mostly of filamentous structures and is helically symmetrical. It also has a non-enveloped protein capsid that is capable of coiling around itself allowing for a super-coiled structure and the helical symmetry. The virus has the potential to be symptomatic or asymptomatic within plants causing the display of symptoms in only a few plants, but the ability to transmit the virus unknowingly in many plants. B1MaV often remains asymptomatic for long periods of time after initial infection allowing for blind transmission.  Symptoms  When a plant is initially infected with the virus the plant will often display a symptom- free period, meaning there is long latent period between viral infection and symptom appearance. The virus can also become dormant in some areas of the plant and expressed in others, causing some leaves to display symptoms and others to be asymptomatic. When a blueberry plant begins to show symptoms of infection by B1MaV a mild to severe mottle and mosaic patterns on foliage appears. The pattern is in the colors of yellow, yellow green, and pink. Usually symptoms appear on only a few leaves, but can appear on more of the plant in severe seasons. The infection also causes late ripening of fruit, reduced yield of the crop, and poor quality of the berries, as the virus spreads throughout the plant and begins affecting cellular mechanisms. The virus does not kill the plant, however, rather it just affects the quality and quantity of fruit produced by the plant.  Structure  The blueberry mosaic associated ophiovirus virion is described as a nonenveloped nucleocapsid. It is a naked filamentous nucleocapsid that can form circles making the open form of the virus or can form a pseudo-linear duplex form that forms the collapsed form of the virus. The nucleocapsid is 3 nm in diameter and 700 to 2000 nm long, pseudo-linear duplex are about 9-10 nm in diameter. Ophiovirdae are composed of 3 to 4 RNA segments, with each segment being individually encapsulated. In the case of B1MaV, there are three RNA segments, and therefore each segment is encapsulated by a nucleocapsid protein. Each encapsulated structure contains a viral and viral complementary RNA strand (vRNA and vcRNA). The population structure is highly conserved in B1MaV as a result of low genetic diversity among isolates of the virus.  Genome  The genome is a linear segmented genome that is 11,467 nucleotides long and is composed of three negative single strand RNA sequences. RNA one is the longest RNA sequence and contains two open reading frames (ORFs) that encode two proteins. The proteins encoded include a 23 kDa protein that has an unknown function and a 272 kDa RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) replicase. The presence of these two ORFs in the largest RNA strand and the two ORF's having the same polarity is a key genomic feature of Ophioviridae. The RdRp encoded has five conserved motifs (A-E). The SDD sequence which is a characteristic sequence for segmented negative strand RNA viruses such as Ophiovirdae is found in motif C of the RdRp. RNA 2 encodes for a 58 kDa movement protein that is thought to also be involved in the suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing. RNA 3 encodes 50 kDa nucleocapsid protein. The 5’ terminal sequences are not conserved between RNA transmissions, but all of the 5’ termini fold into conserved stem-loop structures. These structures are likely involved in packaging of the genomic RNAs into their capsid or in long- distance interactions for transcription and translation. The 3’ terminal of all three RNAs are identical and conserved. The conserved nucleotide sequence is ‘AAUAUC’. Ophiovirdae have a G+C content is 32.3-39.8%. The genome of Ophiovirdae is typically 11.3-12.5 kilobytes long. These viral RNA sequences appear in higher concentrations in symptomatic leaves then in asymptomatic leaves of the same plant.  Replication cycle   Entry into cell  Ophiovirdae travel from cell to cell in a plant via plasmodesmata and often alter the flexibility of the plasmodesmata by affecting proteins such as movement proteins of the virus. The movement proteins that the virus encodes in RNA 2, often effect cellular mechanisms for transport to distant tissues in the plant. B1MaV has nuclear localization signals within its protein sequences. These amino acid sequences tag the protein for import into the cell's nucleus via nuclear transport mechanisms of the cell.  Replication and transcription  B1MaV is translated from mRNA which is complementary to the vRNAs of the virus genome. Replication of ophioviruses as well as virion assembly is believed to occur in the cytoplasm.  Modulation of host processes  There are several proteins produced by the viral mRNA in transcription and translation that affect the host cells processes, making a more suitable environment for viral replication and transcription. There is not much information known as to exactly what viral proteins interfere with the host cell processes. One protein that is encoded on RNA 2 is the movement protein for B1MaV. This protein helps the virus travel between cells via plasmodesmata. It also is involved in suppression in post translational gene silencing of cellular genes, therefore preventing the silencing of some cellular genes causing consequent expression and the effects of these expressed genes.  Tropism  The virus is transmissible via grafting, meaning that when an infected plant is joined with a noninfected plant to promote continued growth of the plant, the infected plant spreads the virus to the once noninfected plant. Asymptomatic plants can serve as reservoirs for the pathogen that can in turn spread the disease to highly susceptible plants. The virus can further spread to new growing areas accidentally by plant nurseries since blueberries are reproduced asexually and asymptomatic blueberry plants may be used. Ophiovirdae are also transmitted through the soil via fungi. This would allow B1MaV to survive in the spores of an infected root fungi leading to further spread. Since the viral genome is three segmented negative RNA strands, there is the possibility for re-assortment of genetic segments between B1MaV and other segmented viruses infecting the same plant, leading to possible further transmission of the virus by other means.  Associated diseases  Citrus psorosis virus Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV) is a viral infection that infects citrus plants causing a major loss in citrus trees by affecting their conductive tissues. Some characteristic symptoms of the disease include bark scaling in the trunk and main branches of an adult plant as well as internal staining in the underlying wood. As in B1MaV this virus has three segmented negative RNA strands within its genome. Citrus psorosis virus also has three negative stranded RNA sequences encased in a protein coat. They also have the closet molecular structure to that of B1MaV in the Ophiovirus genus. This I shown in the analysis of the conserved RdRp motifs in B1MaV and CPsV. The infection occurs in the phloem and parenchyma cells of the citrus trees. The main cytopathic changes of the infected cells are the presence of a large number of abnormal chloroplasts, as well as mitochondria and cellular abnormalities. There has also been reports of lower levels of auxin as a result of viral infection. The species most severally infected are sweet oranges, grapefruit, and mandarin trees. Just as in B1MaV, CpsV is graft transmissible and also appears to remain asymptomatic for the first several years of infection. Lettuce ring necrosis virus Lettuce ring necrosis is a viral infection that affects lettuce leaves, causing necrotic ring like patterns on the middle of leaves. The infected leaves often decay and make the whole plant unusable. As with B1MaV, the lettuce ring necrosis virus spreads via soil transmission through fungal zoospores, and the symptoms in the plant often do not appear for several weeks to months after infection. This virus is a member of the Ophiovirus family and therefore has many of the same genome and structural characteristics as that of B1MaV. This virus often occurs along with lettuce big-vein virus. Lettuce big-vein virus causes the veins of the plant to be banded and sometimes bumpy affecting the quality of the plant causing underdevelopment making the plant unusable References Category:Aspiviridae ","title":"Blueberry mosaic associated ophiovirus"},{"id":"62440620","text":"Doug Harvey is an artist, curator and writer based in Los Angeles.

Species of Chiromyoides are known from the middle Tiffanian through late Clarkforkian North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMA) of western North America, and from late Paleocene deposits in the Paris Basin, France. The unique dental morphology of Chiromyoides has led several authors to propose a specialized ecological role for the genus. Gingerich (1976) hypothesized that Chiromyoides was a specialist on seeds, while Szalay and Delson (1979) and Beard et al. (2020) suggested that it may have consumed wood-boring insects in a manner similar to the aye-aye.  Origins and discovery  The type species of Chiromyoides, C. campanicus, was originally described in 1916 from fragmentary craniodental material discovered in Cernay, France, with additional material also later found at Berru. Gingerich (1973) described the first North American species, Chiromyoides caesor, from two upper incisors found in northern Wyoming. Several years later, he described three additional North American species, C. major, C. minor, and C. potior, from isolated upper incisors found in northern Wyoming, southern Wyoming, and southern Colorado, respectively. Secord (2008) named C. gingerichi from material found in northern Wyoming and southern Montana, Burger and Honey (2008) named C. gigas from several incisors found in northern Colorado, and Beard et al. (2020) named C. kesiwah from material found at several localities in southwestern Wyoming. A second European species, C. mauberti, was named by De Bast et al. (2018) from isolated teeth and several mandibular fragments found near Rivecourt, France.  Evolutionary relationships  Chiromyoides is known only from isolated teeth, mandibular fragments, and maxillary fragments, and its relationships to other plesiadapiforms are not well understood. Chiromyoides is generally acknowledged to be a member of the family Plesiadapidae, along with Plesiadapis, Platychoerops, Nannodectes, and Pronothodectes. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that Chiromyoides is descended from Plesiadapis, perhaps most closely related to Plesiadapis walbeckensis or Plesiadapis tricuspidens. Beard et al. (2020) found that species of Chiromyoides separated into two distinct clades: a more southern clade consisting of C. gigas, C. minor, and C. kesiwah from southern Wyoming and Colorado, and a northern clade including C. major, C. gingerichi, C. campanicus, and C. mauberti. Chiromyoides caesor formed a polytomy with the two main clades. Chiromyoides potior was not included in their analysis. The nesting of the European species C. campanicus and C. mauberti in the northern clade suggests that Chiromyoides dispersed into Europe from North America.  Age and biogeography  The oldest specimens of Chiromyoides are C. minor from the Chappo Type Locality in Lincoln County, Wyoming, and an edentulous mandible from the Black Peaks region of southwest Texas that has been referred to either C. minor or an indeterminate species of Chiromyoides. Both the Chappo locality and the Ray's Bonebed locality of southwest Texas where the edentulous mandible was found are arguably middle Tiffanian (Ti3) in age. Chiromyoides caesor and C. kesiwah come from slightly younger Tiffanian (Ti4) beds in the Bighorn Basin and Washakie Basin, respectively, while C. potior, C. gigas, C. gingerichi, and C. major come from even younger Tiffanian and Clarkforkian deposits in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. Chiromyoides campanicus comes from localities in the Paris Basin that appear to correlate with the late Tiffanian of North America, while C. mauberti occurs in somewhat younger strata that correlates with the North American Clarkforkian NALMA.

She is one of the “young feminists,” who has consistently written about women since her literary debut in 2012. Her writing has been influenced by gothic romance and thrillers written by women writers in the 19th century. She often employs the use of “unreliable narrators” to trigger the reader’s anxiety. She is a recipient of the Munhakdongne Young Writers’ Award (2017) and the Hankyoreh Literary Award (2017).  Life  Kang was born in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, in 1986. Since her childhood, she enjoyed activities that could be performed alone, and reading was her favorite activity by far. In her teens, she dreamed of becoming a writer and received prizes in writing contests. She became a Korean literature major to write, but the lack of creative writing classes led her to join a joint literary review club in college. While considering her future career, she took a semester off from college and focused on writing. To achieve her dream of becoming a writer, she enrolled in a graduate program for narrative creation and continued to write. In 2012, she made her literary debut with the short story “Bang” (방 Room).There is an anecdote related to Kang’s literary debut. The organizers of the literary competition lost her personal information and had to search online for her contact information. They eventually found information for “Kang Hwa-gil, Korean Literature Department” from an internet message board for a class and contacted her parents. Kang learned about receiving the literary prize from her parents and called the organizers back to confirm. Im, Na-ri, “Kang Hwa-gil, ‘It Doesn’t Get Talked About, But It Happens All the Time,” Channel Yes, September 13, 2017. http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/34296  Young Feminists“Young Feminists” refer to younger women writers who have different perspectives than the women writers of the previous generation (1990s and 2000s). While the women writers of the previous generation metaphorically alluded to violence against women in their writing, Young Feminists directly paint women as political agents. They differ from the previous generation of women writers in that they actively respond through literature to the social request to fight against the various violence against women. Young Feminists include Choi Eunyoung, Cho Nam-ju, Kang Hwa-gil, and Park Min-jung. Lee, Yun-ju, “The ‘Feminism Fever’ Is Creating a Meaningful Trend,” Hankook Ilbo, December 28, 2017. https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/201712281794644576 Jeong, Seo-rin, “[2017 Culture] Women’s Wave Brings About Social Introspection, Offering Comfort Through Dialogue,” Seoul Shinmun, December 21, 2017. http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20171222024011&wlog;_tag3=naver  Since her debut, Kang has consistently written about issues related to women, which earned her the description “feminist writer” and “young feminist.” Stories in Gwaenchaneun saram (괜찮은 사람 A Good Person) (2016), Dareun saram (다른 사람 A Different Person) (2017) are laced with anxieties contemporary women have felt at one point in time or another in various situations. Kang believes that women’s issues are an important topic and also feels a sense of duty to write about them, but she takes care not to make them the sole aim of her work. She said that many people warned her about the possibility of being stereotyped as a woman writer who writes about women, since her debut. However, Kang believes that such self-regulation can end up limiting women’s issues that occur within the social structure to personal problems. She is planning to continue and delve into femininity, as it is an interesting and important topic that can be further expanded. She says that she is still in the process of becoming a feminist, and she will strive to show her world through her works.  Writing  Kang was influenced by the works of 19th- century Western women writers, including the Brontë sisters and Mary Shelley, and is particularly interested in the gothic romance and thriller narratives. So Kang’s fiction makes use of the grammar and atmosphere of mystery thrillers in general.Kang expressed her interest in gothic romance thrillers written by 19th-century women writers—stories characterized by limited space, elements of mystery, and romance that was thought to be safe but is not. As though reflecting her thoughts, Kang quotes Shirley Jackson in the writer’s note for Gwaenchanneun saram: “I am the captain of my fate. Laughter is possible laughter is possible laughter is possible.” The reviewer of Kang’s book clarified that Jackson said this at a time when she was being emotionally abused by her husband and brings our attention to the topic of “women’s liberation.” “Kang Hwa-gil, ‘Reading is an Extremely Personal Experience,’” Channel Yes, September 27, 2017.http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/34395 Book information for Gwaenchanneun saram https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=97804554 In addition, unreliable narrators in Kang’s stories heighten the sense of mystery.Roh, Dae- won, “Critical Acclaim,” Seo-u, ASIA, 2018. When the reader, who has been following and trusting the voice of the narrator, realizes the ruptures in the narrative, the narrator becomes an unreliable person. The hunch that there is something else that you cannot quite put your finger on intensifies the reader’s anxiety, leaving the reader to wonder what is underneath the surface of the story. Often the ambivalence that feeds the reader’s anxiety is left unresolved in the work. The anxiety and fear that envelopes Kang Hwa-gil’s stories are linked to the specific real-life events that women in our society encounter in their daily lives. Most of the narrators in Kang’s stories are women, and their statements about their feelings and experiences tend to seem somewhat lacking and at times make them seem overly sensitive. However, as these situations recur, the reader gradually realizes that whether or not what the narrators are saying is true is not the issue at hand. The point is that women cannot but feel anxious and fearful when left in the dark about men’s intentions even if they are good intentions—and the unknowable truth brings suffering upon humans.Hwang, Hyeon-gyeong, “Moreuneun saram” (Someone We Don’t Know), Gwaenchaneun saram, Munhakdongne, 2016.  Gwaenchanneun saram  Gwaenchanneun saram (2016) is a short story collection that features stories with characters who are troubled at heart. It makes the readers ask why the author wrote such characters and what she wants to say through them. This is a reason why we also need to look closely at Kang’s saram (person or people) series. In the titular story “Gwaenchanneun saram,” the first-person narrator has a fiancé. But she is unsure whether the action of her fiancé, which resulted in her getting hurt, was accidental or intentional. Without knowing whether his action was a result of his consideration for her or a threat, the narrator is left to anxiously wonder whether he really is a good person or not. “Nikkola yuchiwon-gwihan saram” (니꼴라 유치원-귀한 사람 Nikola Kindergarten – A Precious Person 니꼴라 유치원-귀한 사람) features a narrator who wants to send her son to a respectable kindergarten, out of a twisted feeling of inferiority. The mysterious atmosphere of the story continues to build, as the narrator learns the reason her son who was second on the waiting list received the chance to attend the kindergarten and hears strange rumors about the kindergarten. Toward the end of the story, it makes the reader question what a “precious person” is and whether the narrator wishes her son or herself to be a “precious person.”In an interview, Kang explained that she started writing the “people” series, which eventually led to her novel Dareun saram (2017). Video interview, “#Book Episode 3: Dareun saram (Kang Hwa-gil),” Hankyoreh, September 8, 2017. http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/812907.html “Hosu- dareun saram” (호수-다른 사람 Lake-Other People) begins with an assault. When her friend is found assaulted, the first-person narrator begins to look into what happened to her friend along with the friend’s boyfriend named Ihan. However, as time passes, the narrator feels terrorized by Ihan, but to Ihan she appears to be an overly sensitive person who asks questions that are unrelated to the incident. The only objective fact is that her friend is lying unconscious in the hospital. The narrator and Ihan are “other people” who were not the victims of assault.  Dareun saram  Kang Hwa-gill's novel Dareun saram (2017) begins with Jin-a, who was subjected to dating abuse, calling the police on her boyfriend. Upset about the soft punishment the perpetrator received, Jin-a writes about what happened to her online but ends up getting hurt by vicious comments about her instead. While scrolling through the comments, she notices one that seems to have been written by someone who knew her in the past and is reminded of a friend named Yu-ri, who died. The narrative continues with stories of dating abuse, hate comments on the internet, and sexual assault in school. Although initially these experiences seem personal, they are eventually revealed to be violence pervasive in Korean society, shared by many people. In addition, Jin-a’s struggle to understand what happened to her as she experiences self-hatred, victim mentality, and self-defense makes the reader wonder if she really is a “different person” from us. At the end of the novel, the author writes “you,” pointing to the people who neglected the victims of abuse around them, thinking that they were different.  Seo-u  Seo-u (서우) (2018) is a story that combines the fear of taking a cab late at night and an urban legend that has become plausible in the era of misogyny.Oh, Hye-jin, “The Political Possibilities of ‘Pleasurable Murder’ and ‘Women’s Thrillers,’” Seo-u, ASIA, 2018. The first-person narrator takes a cab to go to a neighborhood where female cab drivers go missing. The narrator gets into the cab feeling safe as the driver is a woman, but her unpleasant speech is reminiscent of male cab drivers and the narrator soon grows uncomfortable. However, the twist does not end with the point that women can also be perpetrators. As the story about the narrator’s psychopathic tendencies in her childhood surfaces, suddenly the narrator turns into an unreliable narrator and a key suspect. Seo-u distorts the typical structure of an urban legend and also puts a twist into the idea that women are clueless victims.

He is a key figure in the \\"golden age\\" of Cambodian comics prior to the Khmer Rouge regime. He later served as Department Chief for Publishing at the Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.  Career  He was attending the Lycée Sisowath in 1962 when his art teacher introduced him to French bandes dessinées and he was inspired to draw Khmer language comics. Of his first comic book, the story of two teenage friends, he said \\"Frankly the illustrations weren’t beautiful. I had no idea how to draw properly. When I’d finished illustrating the first one, no printers wanted to take it [...] it was new and nothing like it had ever been produced before.” Eventually it was published in 1964 as Neytung Neysang, the first Cambodian comic book. The popular book sold twenty thousand copies and earned him four thousand riel. His second book, Preah Thoung Neang Neak (1964), contained content about tolerance towards Muslims, which prompted the police to arrest and interrogate him for a day. He missed an exam and quit school entirely to devote himself to cartooning. He also drew book covers, illustrated magazines and school books, and painted. Many comic books were lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. The earliest surviving comic book by Uth Rouen is 1966's One Night for You. His career came to a halt when he was conscripted during the Khmer Republic. During the Khmer Rouge regime, he drew construction plans for the government. \\"The government said you are an artist, then you must draw. There was no money paid, just food given. I drew pictures for the Khmer Rouge. If they were building a dam, I did the drawing of it. My fingers were red from exerting myself while drawing for the Pol Pot regime. [...] I served by drawing soldiers, Khmer Rouge plans. I was too skinny to work in the rice fields; I was very thin and could not do hard, physical work.\\" Comics had a resurgence in the 1980s, with new books being published and surviving books reprinted, though many were pirated without attribution to the artists. These years featured reprints of Uth Roeun's Torn Chey (1985), about a peasant boy who outwits the king, and Tum Teav (1986), an adaptation of the classic Cambodian romance, and his new work New Life in Kompong Preah (1986). In 2000 he founded The Association of Cambodian Artist Friends, based near Wat Phnom.

The capsule is 3 mm long with a 2-locular, dehiscent along the thicken margins. Male (left) and female (right) specimen  Distribution  Chordifex hookeri is endemic to Tasmania. It is found it mainly found in the South West of Tasmania, such as the Southwest National Park and the Southwest Conservation Area, where it is abundant and widely distributed. It can also be seen along the west coast stretching to the far north.  Habitat  Chordifex hookeri is a native herb commonly found in infertile poorly-drained acid peaty soil, which are thin or skeletal. It grows on a range of substrates, including dolerite, basalt, alluvium and quartzite gravels, but most commonly on siliceous substrates. It is limited by nutrients and frequent fires control the vegetation. This inhibits larger scrubs and forest to grow and prolongs succession. The annually precipitation is high.Kitchener A, Harris S, 2013. From forest to fjaeldmark: descriptions of Tasmania's vegetation: Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment. Chordifex hookeri is found in buttongrass moorlands, low land sedgelands and restionaceae rushland from near-sea level to about 1000m. In Mt.

Invention and history  First produced and patented in Italy in 1935 by Antonio Ferretti and sold under the name Lanital, milk fiber was created under a national self sufficiency drive and was intended to capitalize on previous successes with rayon. Milk fibers enjoyed a brief period of success in the 1930s and 1940s. The popularity of milk fibers declined rapidly once full-synthetic fibers were developed. Fully synthetic fibers such as acrylic were able to significantly undercut milk fiber on price while being more durable. During the 2010s several producers tried to reintroduce milk fibers to commercial production.  Production process  The production process of milk fiber was of some public interest and was documented on film by several contemporary sources. A simplified overview of the process is as follows: # Acid is mixed with milk to extract the casein. # Water is evaporated to form casein crystals. # The casein is hydrated to a thick syrup and extruded through spinnerets. # The resulting fiber is passed through a hardening bath. # The continuous fiber is then cut to the desired length.

Since his literary debut in 1996, he wrote a number of poems based on his interest in regions north of the Korean Peninsula, including Dandong, China, Tibet, Xinjiang Uyghurs Autonomous Region of China, Siberia, and Baykal. In the early 2000s, he served as the director-general of the Daesan Foundation and planned and organized a variety of events for the globalization of Korean literature.  Life  Kwak was born in Jeonju, South Jeolla Province, in 1967 but grew up in Seoul. After graduating from college, he worked for four years as a reporter for Yonhap News Agency. He made his literary debut with the publication of “Byeokhwa sogui goyangi 3” (벽화 속의 고양이 3 The Cat in the Mural 3) in Segye Ilbo in 1996, followed by the publication of six poems including “Suraksan” (수락산 Mount Surak) in Sipyeong (시평) in 2002. He served as an editor for Munhaknamoo and Urimunhwa and also as the director-general of the Daesan Foundation. As the director-general of the Daesan Foundation, Kwak planned and organized a variety of events for the globalization of Korean literature. In 2000, the Daesan Foundation hosted the first Seoul International Forum for Literature, which Kwak attended the forum alongside the South Korean poet Ko Un, American poet Gary Snyder, English novelist Margaret Drabble, and translator Brother Anthony. Aiming to promote cultural exchange between Korean writers and distinguished writers from around the world, the second edition of the forum was held in 2005, followed by the third edition in 2011, and the fourth in 2017. In 2003, a Korean literature festival was held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia. Cohosted by Russia’s A.M. Gorky Institute of World Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Daesan Foundation, the festival was the first of its kind to be held in Russia. Kwak participated in the festival along with the South Korean poet Chong Hyon-jong, literary critic Yu Jong-ho, literature scholar Cho Tong-il, Russian novelist Anatoli Kim, and researcher Kim Ryo Ho at the Gorky Institute. The year 2008 was the last year of the fellowship program for Korean writers jointly sponsored by the Daesan Foundation and the Center for Korean Studies at UC Berkeley. To discuss the future plans for this program, Kwak visited UC Berkeley. At the Center for Korean Studies, he held a poem reading session, in which he read a few poems from his first poetry collection Indio yeoin (인디오 여인 The Indio Woman). He then visited Mexico to discuss literary translation projects between South Korea and Mexico with Mexican publisher Fondo De Cultura Economica. Kwak also participated in the 2013 World Writers’ Festival along with other renowned poets from Korea and around the world and held a poetry reading.Lee, Gi-tae, “An Encounter with the World’s Literary Giants, 2013 World Writers’ Festival,” Dankook University website, http://www.dankook.ac.kr/web/kor/-550?p_p_id=Bbs_WAR_bbsportlet&p;_p_lifecycle=0&p;_p_state=normal&p;_p_mode=view&_Bbs_WAR_bbsportlet_orderBy=createDate&_Bbs_WAR_bbsportlet_curPage=48&_Bbs_WAR_bbsportlet_action=view_message&_Bbs_WAR_bbsportlet_messageId=334262  Writing   Northern Consciousness  The topic that has been long explored in Kwak Hyo Hwan’s literature is the regions north of the Korean Peninsula. He published a book on his research into the “northern consciousness” of modern Korean poets who were born in the northern regions between the 1920s and the 1940s, including Kim Dong-hwan, Baek Seok, Yi Yong- ak, O Chang-hwan, Yu Chi-hwan, and Yi Yuksa, titled Hanguk geundaesiui bukbanguisik (한국 근대시의 북방의식 The Northern Consciousness in Modern Korean Poetry) (2008).Shin, Chang-yong, “Summoning the North: Kwak Ho Hwan’s Poetry Collection Seulpeumui ppyeodae,” Yonhap News, January 15, 2014. https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20140115098800005 In addition, he traveled and explored regions north of the Korean Peninsula, including the Chinese city Dandong, Tibet, Xinjiang, Siberia, and Baykal. Created based on such experience, his poetry collections Jidoe eomneun jip (지도에 없는 집 The House Not Found on a Map) (2010), Seulpeumui ppyeodae (슬픔의 뼈대 The Frame of Sorrow) (2014) show Kwak’s deep contemplation on the life and history of the northern regions. To Kwak, the concept of norther regions is not simply geographical regions to the north of the Korean Peninsula. As seen in “Baikal saramdeul” (바이칼 사람들 The People of Baykal), the north is a warm and hospitable place where human life has been kept in it is original form, before life has become fragmented and desolate through the modern civilization. But at the same time, the north reminds us of the turbulent history of Korea, such as the independence movement and forced labor in colonial Korea under the Japanese rule, as well as the division of the Korean Peninsula, portrayed in “Siberia hoengdanyeolcha 2” (시베리아 횡단열차2 The Trans-Siberian Railroad 2). Regarding the north, Kwak explained, “It is the beginning and the end. Even if you were isolated, oppressed by the powerful, there you could face each other and live in harmony.” When asked about the reason he repeatedly uses the imagery of the northern regions, he replied, “Our life is in disharmony, as we wish to return to that peaceful place but are unable to. I wanted to express that.”Kim, Yu- tae, “Kwak Hyo Hwan Publishes Poetry Collection Neoneun, ‘People and Longing are Synonyms,’” Maeil Business News, November 7, 2018. https://www.mk.co.kr/news/culture/view/2018/11/698640/  Consciousness of the Other  Kwak’s fourth poetry collection Neoneun (너는 You Are), published in 2018, was praised for adding socio-historical imagination to the issue that he has long explored—the issue of the formation of relationship between the self and others. According to the foreword, “you” is “the other but also us.” It is “the beginning and the end” and “the unreachable other inside me.” In Neoneun, “you” is expressed in a number of different ways—“you” is Kwak’s father, who left for a port city to look for a job and whom young Kwak waited for endlessly (“Madangeul geonneoda” (마당을 건너다 Crossing the Yard)) or a Koryo- saram youth, who has been wandering through Hamgyeong Province, Primorsky Krai, Moscow, and Seoul to make a living (“Naneun Koryo-saramida” (나는 고려 사람이다 I Am Koryo-saram)).“Neoneun (You Are) Not Different from Me or Us: Kwak Hyo Hwan’s Poetry Collection,” Maeil Business News, October 28, 2018. https://www.mk.co.kr/news/culture/view/2018/10/671632/ In “2014-nyeon yeoreum, Gwanghwamun gwangjangeseo” (2014년 여름, 광화문광장에서 In Summer 2014 at Gwanghwamun Square), Kwak described his search of the foundation dubbed “you” in this time and age when everyone touted themselves, against the backdrop of the Gwanghwamun Square where all kinds of protests and rallies are held. In this way, Kwak attempts to get in touch with “you,” or everyone else who is not “me.” His poetic work seems to spur interest in “us” as a community rather than the individuals, such as “me” or singular “you.”  Works   Poetry Collections  *《인디오 여인》, 민음사, 2006 / Indio yeoin (The Indio Woman), Minumsa, 2006 * 《지도에 없는 집》, 문학과지성사, 2010 / Jidoe eomneun jip (The House Not Found on a Map), Moonji, 2010 * 《슬픔의 뼈대》, 문학과지성사, 2014 / Seulpeumui ppyeodae (The Frame of Sorrow), Moonji, 2014 * 《너는》, 문학과지성사, 2018 / Neoneun (You Are), Moonji, 2018  Research  *《한국 근대시의 북방의식》, 서정시학, 2008 / Hanguk geundaesiui bukbanguisik (The Northern Consciousness in Modern Korean Poetry), Lyric Poetry (서정시학), 2008  Co-authorship or Compilations  *《아버지, 그리운 당신》(공편), 서정시학, 2009 / Abeoji, geuriun dangsin (Father, I Miss You) (co-edited), Lyric Poetry, 2009 *《구보 박태원의 시와 시론》(편), 푸른사상, 2011 / Kubo Park Taewon-ui siwa siron (Poetry and Poetics of Kubo Park Taewon) (edited), Prunsasang, 2011 *《초판본 이용악 시선》(편), 지식을만드는지식, 2012 / Chopanbon Yi Yong-ak siseon (Selected First-Edition Poems of Yi Yong-ak) (edited), Zmanz Books, 2012 *《가난한 내가 아름다운 나타샤를 사랑해서》(편), 교보문고, 2012 / Gananhan naega areumdaun Natasha-reul saranghaeseo (The Poor Man That I Am Was in Love With Natasha) (edited), Kyobo Book, 2012 *《너는 내게 너무 깊이 들어왔다》(편), 교보문고, 2014 / Neoneun naege neomu gipii deureowatda (You Came Too Deep Into My Heart) (edited), Kyobo Book, 2014 *《이용악 전집》(공편), 소명출판, 2015 / Yi Yong-ak jeonjip (Collected Works of Yi Yong-ak) (co-edited), Somyung Books, 2015 *《청록집》(편), 교보문고, 2016 / Cheongnokjip (Blue Green Book) (edited), Kyobo Book, 2016 *《별 헤는 밤》(편), 교보문고, 2017 / Byeol heneun bam (A Starry Night) (edited), Kyobo Book, 2017  Works in Translation  * 고래의 노래/ A Galaxy of Whale Poems, Munhaksasang, 2005[Literature Translation Institute of Korea] Digital Library of Korean Literature https://library.ltikorea.or.kr/node/21060 * 서울/포르토프랭스: 바이링귀얼 리뷰 / séoul/port-au-prince: revue bilingue, Verdier Editions, 2015[Literature Translation Institute of Korea] Digital Library of Korean Literature https://library.ltikorea.or.kr/node/19990 * 곽효환 시선집 / КУАГ ХЮУХУАНЬ НАЙРАГЧИЙН ШИЛМЭЛ ТҮҮВЭР, Soyombo, 2017[Literature Translation Institute of Korea] Digital Library of Korean Literature https://library.ltikorea.or.kr/node/32334  Awards  *Aeji Literary Award (애지문학상, 2013) (for “Supui jeonggeojang” (숲의 정거장 A Bus Stop in the Forest)) *Kim Geon-il Literary Award (김건일문학상, 2016) (for Seulpeumui ppyeodae) *Pyeon-un Literature Prize (편운문학상, 2015) (for Seulpeumui ppyeodae) *Yushim Literature Prize (2016) (for “Madangeul geonneoda”) *Kim Daljin Literature Prize (2019) (for Neoneun)  Sources  [Daesan Foundation] http://www.daesan.or.kr/ (2019.08.01. 10:00(UTC +9:00)) [Seoul International Forum for Literature] 서울국제문학포럼 http://seoulforum.org/2017/intro.html?uid=4 (2019.08.01. 10:00(UTC +9:00))  References  Category:1967 births Category:South Korean male poets Category:20th-century South Korean poets Category:21st-century South Korean poets Category:Living people ","title":"Kwak Hyo-hwan"},{"id":"62440841","text":"Montara Creek is a creek in San Mateo County that flows from Montara Mountain.

Life and career The son of a railway official, Bert Tobin lived in North Adelaide. He was educated at Rostrevor College in Adelaide from 1925 to 1928, boarding in his final two years. He was a prominent member of the school's cricket and football teams. He won the South Australian Junior Golf Championship in 1928. A hard-hitting batsman in the middle or lower order and a fast-medium opening bowler, Tobin stood six feet two inches tall. He made his first-class debut for South Australia in the 1930-31 season just before his 20th birthday. He took his best first-class figures of 4 for 31 against Victoria in the Sheffield Shield in November 1932, when he and Tim Wall dismissed Victoria for 92 and South Australia won by three wickets. He made his highest first-class score of 61 in the next match, against New South Wales. Despite his good form it was a surprise when he was selected in the Australian team for the Fourth Test against England later that season, as his overall achievements had been moderate: \\"a useful rather than a match-winning figure in South Australian cricket\\". He probably owed his selection to his ability to bowl bouncers.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 534. In the event he was made twelfth man and was not selected for Australia again. During his South Australian career Tobin worked in the Adelaide sports store part-owned by the cricketer Philip Lee. He left Australia in 1935 to play as a professional for Rishton in the Lancashire League. He remained in the UK, marrying a rich woman and playing club cricket in Scotland.David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, p. 274. After two decades abroad he returned to Australia, coaching cricket in the Melbourne suburb of Essendon and in Alice Springs.

Early life  Frank was born on 17 July 1993 in Sheffield, Yorkshire, to Christine and Kevin Frank. At the age of five, Frank had an operation to repair a hole in his heart and has since been an ambassador for Yorkshire-based national charity Heart Research UK. Frank took up boxing at the age of twelve, compiling an amateur record of 23–22, training at the Sheffield Boxing Centre in Hillsborough under the tutelage of head trainer Glyn Rhodes. After leaving school he studied plumbing at Castle College in Sheffield and worked as a laborer before turning professional. Professional career Frank made his professional debut on 30 July 2016, scoring a four-round points decision victory over Sergey Tasimov at the Magna Centre in Rotherham. After compiling a record of 6–0, he challenged Craig Derbyshire for the Central Area super-flyweight title on 27 April 2018 at the iceSheffield in Yorkshire, winning by points decision over ten rounds. Following two more wins, one by stoppage, he was scheduled to face Ross Murray on 15 March 2019 for the vacant Commonwealth super-flyweight title at the Ponds Forge Arena, Sheffield. After Murray withdrew from the bout, his new opponent was announced as Luke Wilton. Frank won the fight via fourth-round technical knockout (TKO). Frank dropped his opponent four times before the stoppage; a little over a minute into the first-round, Wilton was down from a straight right hand. After beating the referee's count of ten Frank unloaded a barrage of punches culminating in a right hook to send Wilton to the canvas for a second time. In the fourth, Frank came out from the opening bell throwing power punches. 10 seconds into the round, while backed up against the ropes, Wilton was caught with a left hook to the body to send him down for the third time. Wilton raised to his feet to beat the count yet again, but came under immediate fire from Frank, who was switching his attacks from head to body, eventually finding his target with a right hook to the midsection to send Wilton down for the fourth and final time. Referee Michael Alexander waved off the fight as Wilton made it to his feet on the count of ten. Following a seventh-round TKO win over John Chuwa in July, he returned to the Ponds Forge Arena on 20 September 2019, facing Aran Dipaen for the vacant WBC International Silver super-flyweight title. Frank won the title by split decision. In a hard-fought, even contest, two judges' scored the bout 116–113 and 115–113 in favour of Frank, while the third scored it 115–113 to Dipaen.

It is at the southeast corner of Union Square East/Park Avenue South and East 17th Street. The neo-Georgian structure was erected in 1928-1929 and designed by architects Thompson, Holmes & Converse and Charles B. Meyers for the Tammany Society political organization, also known as Tammany Hall. It is the organization's oldest surviving headquarters building. The Tammany Society had relocated to 44 Union Square from a previous headquarters on nearby 14th Street. At the time of the building's commission, the society was at its maximum political popularity with members such as U.S. senator Robert F. Wagner, governor Al Smith, and mayor Jimmy Walker. However, after Tammany Hall lost its influence in the 1930s, the building was sold to an affiliate of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in 1943. By the 1980s, it was used by the Union Square Theatre, while the New York Film Academy took space in 1994. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 2013, and it was converted into an office and retail structure during a renovation that took place between 2016 and 2020.  History   Context  By the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square in Manhattan had grown into a major transportation hub with several elevated and surface railroad lines running nearby, and the New York City Subway's 14th Street–Union Square station having opened four years prior. The area had also become a major wholesaling district with several loft buildings, as well as numerous office buildings. The office structures included the Everett Building, erected at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street in 1908; the Germania Life Insurance Company Building, erected at the northeast corner of the same intersection in 1910–1911; and the Consolidated Gas Building (later Consolidated Edison Building), constructed three blocks south at 14th Street between 1910 and 1914. By the 1920s, the remaining buildings in Union Square were occupied by theaters, while most buildings on the eastern part of the square were owned by department stores S. Klein and Ohrbach's. The previous headquarters of Tammany Hall, a prominent Democratic Party political organization in New York City, had been located on 14th Street next to the Consolidated Gas Building. The organization—named after Tamanend, the chief of the Lenape who originally occupied New York City—extensively used Native American titles and terminology, for instance referring to their headquarters as a wigwam. After the expansion of the Consolidated Gas building was announced in 1926, the old Tammany Hall \\"wigwam\\" was sold to J. Clarence Davis and Joseph P. Day, of real estate syndicate D&D; Company, on December 6, 1927. D&D; Company sold the old wigwam again to Consolidated Gas in January 1928. There were allegations that Tammany leaders profited from the sale of the headquarters, which Tammany leader George Washington Olvany denied. Day, a long-time member of Tammany Hall, eventually agreed to give the $70,000 profit from the sale () to Tammany.  Construction  One week after the sale of the old \\"wigwam\\", Tammany purchased a site nearby, at 44 Union Square East near the southwest corner with Park Avenue South and East 17th Street. Olvany announced the sale on December 14, 1927. As originally proposed, the Tammany Hall Building was an American colonial style building, measuring on 17th Street by on Union Square East, with storefronts on the ground floor and a 1,200-seat auditorium. At the time of the announcement, the society's members included state senators Robert F. Wagner and Al Smith: the former would become U.S. senator for New York, while the latter would become the state's governor and 1932 presidential candidate. According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the old headquarters was associated with the society's corrupt past under William M. \\"Boss\\" Tweed, while the new headquarters' construction represented its future and an opportunity for Smith. In January 1928, a month after the purchase of the site, Charles B. Meyers was selected along with Thompson, Holmes & Converse as the building's architects. The plans were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings that April. Tammany Hall remained in its old headquarters until July 4, 1928, so it could celebrate the U.S. Independence Day at that location. Immediately afterward, it moved to a temporary space at 2 Park Avenue. Construction progressed quickly, without any cornerstone-laying ceremony to mark the start of work, and by December much of the structure was substantially complete. The New York County Democratic Committee, a club for Democratic officials representing New York County (Manhattan), started using the new structure on January 2, 1929, and the ceremonial cornerstone was laid the next week, marking the completion of the facade.  Tammany and union uses  Seen in 2010 The \\"wigwam\\" at 44 Union Square was finished by early July 1929. A dedication celebration was held on July 4, 1929. Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and former governor Smith spoke at the dedication. The structure had cost $350,000 to erect (). Shortly after, during the early 1930s, Tammany Hall started to lose its political influence. Although Roosevelt was also a Democrat, he did not regard the organization highly, opening several corruption investigations into the organization. Roosevelt's election to U.S. president in 1933, as well as the election of Republican mayoral candidate Fiorello H. La Guardia the same year, contributed to the downfall of the Tammany Society. By the early 1940s, the Tammany Society could no longer afford to maintain its \\"wigwam\\". Local 91, a local affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), was simultaneously looking for a new headquarters and offered to purchase the structure in April 1943. The sale was finalized that September. Tammany's leaders moved to the National Democratic Club on Madison Avenue at East 33rd Street, and the Society's collection of memorabilia went into a warehouse in the Bronx. The New York County Democratic Committee, meanwhile, moved to other quarters in Midtown Manhattan. The ILGWU enlarged the stage and furnished the offices, officially rededicating the building on December 18, 1943, at an event with several leaders including mayors La Guardia and Jimmy Walker. Upon completion of renovation, the ILGWU opened meeting spaces, offices, art studios, and classrooms in the former Tammany building. 44 Union Square's auditorium was renamed for the late president Roosevelt in 1947. The Roosevelt Auditorium was used often for other unions' events. For instance, in the 1950s the auditorium was used for meetings of firefighters; gardeners, municipal laborers, and sewage workers; and sanitation workers. The United Federation of Teachers held meetings at the Roosevelt Auditorium in 1960 to resolve a citywide teachers' strike, and again in October 1968 to approve the Ocean Hill/Brownsville teachers' strike. Additionally, several unions in the private sector often met at the Roosevelt Auditorium, such as those of newspaper delivery people;See for example: * * * drivers of taxicabs in fleets; hospital workers; and Teamsters unions. In 1969, the auditorium was also the location of a high-profile disagreement between two Central Labor Council leaders, who endorsed opposing candidates in the 1969 New York City mayoral election. By the 1980s, the ILGWU's membership had decreased because of an exodus of garment manufacturers in New York City.  Performing arts uses  At a premiere event for Harold Pinter's play Old Times, ILGWU executive vice president Wilbur Daniels had a chance encounter with Gene Feist, co-founder of Roundabout Theatre Company. After Feist mentioned that the lease theater's premises at 23rd Street was about to expire, Local 91 leased 44 Union Square to Roundabout in June 1984. As part of the $850,000 renovation (), the theater was split in half from west to east, reducing its capacity to 499 seats. The stage was expanded, while the balcony and the orchestra were also refurbished. Though the renovated theater was originally slated to open in late 1984, the conversion of the space was delayed by several months. The first performance took place within the space on February 1, 1985. After Roundabout's lease ran out in 1990, it moved to the Criterion Theater in Times Square. 44 Union Square was then leased in June 1994 by Alan Schuster and Mitchell Maxwell, who also operated the Minetta Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village. In preparation for converting the space for use by the Union Square Theatre, Schuster and Maxwell renovated the interior, painting the dome a sky-blue hue, and replacing the seats' upholstery with burgundy materials. The building started housing the New York Film Academy in July 1994, and the Union Square Theatre held its first performance in the space that November. The Liberty Theatres, a subsidiary of the Reading Company, operated the Union Square Theatre. In 2001 Liberty Theatres bought the structure from the ILGWU. The air rights above the building were sold to another Reading Company subsidiary in 2005, giving the company the right to theoretically erect another structure above 44 Union Square.  Landmark status and redevelopment  Though preservationists had been advocating for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to designate 44 Union Square an official city landmark since the 1980s, the ILGWU had been indifferent toward landmark status. When Liberty Theatres bought the building, preservationists hoped that the company would be more receptive toward landmark status. However, the effort stalled for several years. The LPC designated it as a city landmark in October 2013, following public meetings held to gauge opinion for the designation, in which 17 people expressed support and no one expressed opposition. In the early 2010s Liberty Theatres announced its plans to refurbish the Tammany Hall Building. As part of the renovation, a glass dome was to be added to the building, though these plans were denied by the LPC in 2014. The following year, a scaled-back version of the glass dome was approved by the commission. The New York Film Academy moved out in late 2015, and all existing tenants were evicted the next year. The $50 million renovation project, designed by BKSK Architects, began in July 2016. The auditorium was demolished to make way for retail and office space. The renovation of the structure, renamed 44 Union Square, was supposed to be completed in 2018. By February 2019, the glass dome was under construction and the renovation was slated to be completed that year. The dome was structurally completed in July 2019, and work was substantially completed by July 2020. Prospective tenant Slack Technologies, which was slated to take all the space in 2019, ultimately withdrew from the project in early 2020.  Design  Tammany Hall logo on the pediment 44 Union Square, a -story neo- Georgian building, is the oldest surviving wigwam of the Tammany Society. It measures on its western facade along Union Square East, and on its northern facade along 17th Street. The particular neo-Georgian features in the Tammany Hall Building include Flemish bond brickwork; rectangular windows with stone keystones, set in arched openings; and wrought-iron balconies. The facades along Union Square East and on 17th Street are both arranged to give the appearance of symmetry. The bracketed gable, on the pediment above the portico, is not of neo-Georgian design but was likely inspired by a niche on the facade of the 14th Street building. The exterior design features are evocative of government buildings in the American colonial and Federal styles that were built in the later 19th century, when the society was founded. These features include a first level above a raised basement; a portico on Union Square East, with a pediment supported by columns in the Doric order; a hip roof; and a frieze running along the top of the structure. According to a commemorative publication from the Tammany Society, these features were inspired by the design of Federal Hall in Lower Manhattan, as well as by Somerset House in London. The Tammany Hall Building was one of several structures built in New York City in the early 20th century whose designs were inspired by government buildings. Other such structures included The Town Hall near Times Square, the Museum of the City of New York on the Upper East Side, and the original Staten Island Museum building in St. George.  Facade  Roof conversion of 44 Union Square, seen in 2019 The facade consists of limestone at the basement and first level. and English red brick on the second story and above. The Old Virginia Brick Company, who created the exterior brick, said in an advertisement that the hardiness of the brick, in conjunction with the \\"softening and toning down of the limestone\\", would turn the building into an enduring symbol of New York City's \\"historic yester- years\\". On Union Square East, within the center of the first floor, was the entrance to the commercial space on the first floor. The commercial space is located below a second-floor balcony. The balcony is located in the center of the facade, below the pedimented portico. In the round-arched gable of the pediment, above the portico, there is a panel depicting arrows intertwined with an olive branch, which flank Tammany Hall's circular logo. On 17th Street, there is a set of triple arches in the center of the first floor, which originally provided egress from the building's auditorium. The main entrance to the theater and elevator lobby was located to the right (west) side of the arches, and a similar arch grouping was located to the left (east). Above the first floor, in the center of the building, is an inscription reading \\"1786 THE SOCIETY OF TAMMANY OR COLUMBIAN ORDER 1928\\".  Features  According to a book published by the Tammany Society in 1936, the western half of the building contained various offices. The Tammany Society had exclusive use of the third floor, which included a central lounge, a club room, office and meeting rooms, and various waiting rooms. The Democratic County Committee was located on the second floor. The first floor was occupied by commercial space. Starting in 2016, the basement, first, and second floors were being renovated into of retail space.

Critical reception  Early architectural critics lauded the Tammany Hall Building as a paragon of the neo-Georgian style in New York City. The Real Estate Record & Guide said that the \\"severe Colonial columns\\" placed at the center of both facades contributed to the building's \\"dignified architectural treatment\\". The Architecture & Building magazine said that the structure was \\"well proportioned\\". George Shepard Chappell, writing in The New Yorker under the pseudonym \\"T-Square\\", praised the Tammany Hall Building's \\"exceptionally charming design\\", saying that it was a \\"real adornment\\" to Union Square.

Herbivores could increase plant diversity or decrease plant diversity.  Dominant species effect  People used to think herbivores increase plant diversity by avoiding dominance. Dominant species tend to exclude subordinate species as competitive exclusion. However, the effects on plant diversity caused by variation in dominance could be beneficial or negative. Herbivores do increase bio-diversity by consuming dominant plant species, but they can also prefer eating subordinate species according to plants’ palatability and quality. In addition to the preference of herbivores, herbivores' effects on plant diversity are also influenced by other factors, defense trade-off theory, the predator-prey interaction, and inner traits of the environment and herbivores.  Defense trade-off theory effect  One way that plants could differ in their susceptibility to herbivores is through defense trade-off. Defense trade-off theory is commonly used to be seen as a fundamental theory to maintain ecological evenness. Plants can make a trade-off response to resource allocation, such as between defense and growth. Defenses against herbivores on plant diversity can vary in different situations. It can be neutral, detrimental or beneficial for plant fitness. Even in the absence of defensive trade-offs, herbivores may still be able to increase plant diversity, such as herbivores prefer subordinate species rather than dominant species. The predator-prey interaction, especially the “top-down” regulation. The predator-prey interaction encourages the adaptation in plant species which the predator prefers. The theory of “top-down” ecological regulation disproportionately manipulates the biomass of dominant species to increase diversity. The herbivore effect on plant is universal but still significantly distinguish on each site, can be positive or negative.  Productivity effect  In a highly productive system, the environment provides an organism with adequate resources to grow. The effects of herbivores competing for resources on the plant are more complicated. The existence of herbivores can increase plant diversity by reducing the abundance of dominant species, redundant resources then can be used by subordinate species. Therefore, in a highly productive system, direct consumption of dominant plants could indirectly benefit those herbivory-resistant and unpalatable species. But the less productive system can support limited herbivores because of lack of resources. Herbivory boosts the abundance of most tolerant species and decreases the less-tolerant species’ existence which accelerates the plant extinction. Moderate productive system sometimes barely has long-term effects on plant diversity. Because the environment provides a stable coexistence of different organisms. Even when herbivores create some disturbances to the community. The system is still able to recover to the original state. Light is one of the most important resources in environments for plant species. Competition for light availability and predator avoidance are equally important. With the addition of the resources, more competition arises among plant species. But herbivores can buffer the diversity reduction. Especially large herbivores can enhance the bio-diversity by selectively excluding tall, dominant plant species, and increase light availability.  Body size of herbivores effect  Body size of herbivores is a key reason underlying the interaction between herbivores and plant diversity, and the body size explains many of the phenomena connected to herbivore-plant interaction. Small herbivores are less likely to decrease plant diversity. Because small non-digging animals may not cause too many disturbances to the environment. Intermediate-sized herbivores mostly increase plant diversity by consuming or influencing the dominant plant species, such as herbivore birds, that can directly use dominant plant species. While some herbivores enhance plant diversity by indirect effects on plant competition. Some digging animals at this size local community environmental fluctuations. And the adaptation of plant species to avoid predators can also adjust the vegetation structure and increase diversity. Larger herbivores often increase plant diversity. They use competitively dominant plant species, and disperse seeds and create disorder of the soil. Besides, their urine position also adjusts the local plant distribution, and prevent light competition. Therefore, the mechanisms of herbivores’ effects on plant diversity are complicated. Generally, the existence of herbivores increases plant diversity. But varies according to different environmental factors, multiple factors combined together to affect how herbivores influence plant diversity.

It is named after the physician and educator Maria Montessori. Tarlac Montessori School offers co-educational kindergarten, elementary, junior high school, and senior high school programs. TMS offers a Special Science Class (SSC) for grades 1-12. TMS undergraduates follow a Catholic-rooted curriculum throughout their programs and hosts Wednesday Novenas and First Friday Mass in the mornings that they are scheduled. TMS also celebrates Catholic holidays and the feast days of saints. Tarlac Montessori School was and still is managed by its directress Dr. Elizabeth T. Asiaten and her husband, Tarlac Board Member Danilo Canlas Asiaten. History Tarlac Montessori School entrance, front parking slots, and soccer field Tarlac Montessori School was established in 1987 at its first site at Masagana Building, F. Tañedo Street with its initial enrollees of 30 pupils in Nursery and Kindergarten. After a year, the number of enrollees doubled. In 1989 the school transferred to M.H. del Pilar Street with 180 enrollees and Grade One level was added. That same year, TMS held the first Stepping Up Ceremonies. The next year, TMS opened the San Sebastian extension building to address the growing population of the school. In 1991, the San Sebastian building expanded having another wing; the school added a grade three level with a total of 328 enrollees. It was in the same year that the government granted recognition for its preschool department. A year after, the San Sebastian extension building expanded into a two-storey building for it added the grade four level with a total of 394 enrollees. In 1993, TMS joined for the first time the TAPSA Academic, Literary and Musical Competitions where they won second place with only grade four and grade five contestants. To accommodate the rapid growth of population, TMS constructed a new school building at a two-hectare lot in La Puerta Del Sol Hi-Land Subdivision in 1995. It was in the same year that it had the first grade school commencement exercise with 21 graduates. It was in 1996 that the new school building was inaugurated, opening the High School Department with 38 first year students and 13 second year students. The total school population then was 755 and the first PTC was organized; in the same year TMS produced their official magazine called “The HARK”. In 1998, TMS hosted TAPSA and became the Overall Champion in the elementary level, which coincided with the establishment of the TMS Boy Scout Movement, and the Student Council. In 2005, the school was granted Government Recognition No. 05, s. 2011 to offer the Special Science Curriculum in the First Year level. In 2012, TMS celebrated its 25th anniversary as an educational institution. In 2015, the school was granted permission to offer the Special Science Curriculum for Grade One. In 2016, the K to 12 Senior High School Grade 11 was implemented under the Government Permit SHSP No. 178, s. 2015. Additional six classrooms on the right wing of the building were constructed. The school is currently applying for ISO 9001:2015 certification.  Academics   Programs  Tarlac Montessori School offers programs at the kindergarten, elementary, and secondary levels. The secondary level comprises junior high school and senior high school. Its academic offerings include the Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) and the Special Science Curriculum (SSC) at the elementary and junior high school levels. An incoming Grade 1 student can take a test and be offered and SSC section. A person in the SSC must maintain a grade of 85 or higher for major subjects (English, Math, and Science) and a grade of 83 or higher for minor subjects. All incoming students will also take the test again in Grade 7, including those previously in the curriculum in Grade 6. In 2016, TMS opened its senior high school (Grades 11 and 12) program with the following strands: Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).  Student organizations  There are 8 accredited student organizations in Tarlac Montessori School. These are the Common Denominators' Guild (also referred to as the Math Club), Supreme Student Government (commonly abbreviated as SSG), Debate Society, TMS Chorale, Eco-Warriors Club, The Hark (the official publication of the institution), Technology Club, and the Tarlac Montessori School Scouting Movement.

Set in 1851, The Sower takes place in a village where the women have been left on their own after all the men were rounded up in order to prevent an uprising. The film premiered at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in 2017 and was released in the U.S. in 2019. Plot During the French coup d'état of 1851, all the adult men of a small rural village are rounded up, leaving the women behind to fend for themselves. After months pass with no word from the men, the women believe they are dead and become concerned that no men at all have passed through the village. The younger women make a pact that if a man should come through, they will share him equally so that they might have children. They further pledge to only sleep with the man if he agrees to sleep with all of them. In the summer a blacksmith, Jean, arrives looking for work. The women give him shelter, at first tentatively, not willing to admit that they are alone. However Violette, the young woman chosen to look after him, admits that all the men have been arrested and learns in return that Napoleon has declared himself emperor, and that all the prisoners have either died or been deported. Violette asks Jean not to tell the other women. Jean decides to stay to help the women with the harvest. He seems to show a preference for Violette, and the other women who have made the pact with her urge Violette to seduce Jean so that he will stay. Violette and Jean become lovers, and soon the other women begin to pressure Violette to remember their pact and to bring up the subject with Jean. Reluctantly she does. Jean is disgusted with the idea and Violette tells him he has the option to leave. After he disappears for a day, Violette goes through his things and discovers that he is in hiding and thus cannot leave. Returning, he agrees to sleep with the other women and honour Violette's pact. Even as he sleeps with the other women, Violette and Jean stay intimate. He reveals to her that he killed a man and is now wanted, and must leave France. After Violette becomes pregnant, the first of the women to do so, Jean asks Violette to depart with him. After two years, some of the men begin returning home. The women realize that the returning men will judge them and their children. To keep the secret of the paternity of the children, a village elder tells Violette that Jean must leave. Violette initially intends to go with him. But Jean, realizing that his future is uncertain, and that Violette has a strong and supportive community around her, departs the village unannounced, leaving Violette a letter explaining himself and promising to write once he is settled.

Early life and education Chang initially served in the Japanese imperial army during the Japanese occupation of Korea. He graduated from the history department of Toyo University, planning to become a teacher, but later served as an officer in China. Career Involvement in the May 16 coup Chang first learned of the coup from Park Chung-hee on 10 April 1961, who wanted him to lead the new government so that the entire military would support it. He responded by neither joining the plotters nor notifying the government. This indecisiveness has been seen as giving legitimacy to the coup. In addition, Chang later convinced then-prime minister Chang Myon, that a security report containing leaked details of the coup (when it was scheduled to occur on May 12) was unreliable. This allowed the planners to postpone it to May 16. Rise and decline After the coup, Chang was appointed as a figurehead leader while Park held the real power. Soon afterwards, however, he formed a small faction of moderates, causing conflict with other more militarist officers, including Park. At his peak, Chang occupied four positions: chairman of the Supreme Council, prime minister defense minister, and army chief of staff. Through May 1961, he attempted to gain recognition of the new government from the United States, meeting with John F. Kennedy on 24 May and promising a transfer to civilian control by 15 August (a priority for the US and president in name only Yun Posun, who Chang wanted to remain in office) on 31 May. These moves quickly made him unpopular with the rest of the military leaders, who saw him as a threat to their power and the goals of the coup. In June, after winning the acceptance of the US, Park and his followers turned the tide against Chang by implementing laws to restrict his influence. On July 3, Chang, the ten MPs posted around him for security, and forty-four other officers were arrested on charges of conspiring to execute a countercoup. He surrendered without any resistance. Exile and later years Before his trial, Chang had already made it clear that he would flee to the United States, a move his persecutors didn't object to. After leaving in 1962, he completed his doctorate in political science at the University of Michigan. Chang claimed that he had visited South Korea in 1968 and met with Park as well as troops who participated in the Vietnam War. He joined Western Michigan University as an associate professor in 1971 and retired in 1993. By 2011, it was reported that he was suffering from dementia.

In Taiwan, he was known as Chia Po (), a simplified transliteration of his surname, or by the nickname Big Beard (). Life and career J. Bruce Jacobs was born on 19 September 1943 in the United States, and educated at Columbia University, where he earned bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. While completing master's-level coursework, Jacobs spent 1965 and 1966 in Taiwan, with the History Research Institute of National Taiwan University. Jacobs finished his master's degree in 1970. He returned to Taiwan between 1971 and 1973, during his doctoral study, which he completed in 1975. In 1976, Jacobs was named a lecturer at La Trobe University. In 1980, Jacobs was detained for three months, and falsely accused of involvement in the stabbing death of Lin Yi-hsiung's mother, as well as the born to Lin and Fang Su-min. In its coverage of the murders, the United Daily News became the first publication to refer to Jacobs as \\"Big Beard.\\" Following his departure from Taiwan in May 1980, Jacobs was barred by the Kuomintang government from entering Taiwan until 1992. In the early 1990s, Jacobs was appointed to the Australia-China Council. He began teaching at Monash University in 1991, and was granted emeritus status upon retirement in 2014. Jacobs received the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon from the government of the Republic of China in November 2018, and was named a member of the Order of Australia in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours. Jacobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2017, and died in Melbourne on 24 November 2019, aged 76. Publications Several opinion pieces written by Jacobs were published in the Taipei Times. While writing for that publication, he argued that a paradigm shift was necessary in Taiwanese politics and diplomatic efforts, while comparing the one-China policy to the flat Earth model. Jacobs also opined on the teaching of Taiwanese history, the Senkaku Islands dispute, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and Cross-Strait as well as foreign relations of Taiwan. In 2013, Jacobs argued for Taiwan's status as a middle power. Many of Jacobs' writings took the form of an open letter in which he discussed a wide array of topics relating to politics in Taiwan. Such letters were specifically addressed to Taiwanese politicians Wang Ching-feng, Ma Ying-jeou, and generally to Taiwanese people, as well as Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Qantas chief executive officer Alan Joyce. Jacobs regularly penned electoral analyses for the Taipei Times, including in 2004, 2005, 2008's presidential and legislative election, 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018. In written and spoken commentary, Jacobs was critical of Su Chi, as well as the presidency of Chen Shui-bian. He also discussed the loss of Taiwan-centric publications Taiwan Communique and Thinking Taiwan, which both ceased publication in 2016. In Lee Teng-hui and the Idea of Taiwan Jacobs and I-hao Ben Liu discussed Lee Teng-hui's contribution to Taiwan's democratization, Taiwanization, and Taiwanese nationalism. Jacobs wrote a number of books about Taiwan, which included Local Politics in Rural Taiwan under Dictatorship and Democracy (2008), Democratizing Taiwan (2012), The Kaohsiung Incident in Taiwan and Memoirs of a Foreign Big Beard (2016), and Changing Taiwanese Identities (2018, edited with Peter Kang).

He composed over five hundred pieces and arranged more than 250 songs, including many Volkslieder, and he is considered one of the most versatile and prolific composers of German light music.  Life  Fried Walter was born as the son of an elementary school teacher near Dresden. His mother died when Walter was only 5 years old. Although his father encouraged him to also become a teacher, Walter focused his studies on musical instruments, including piano, cello, organ, and French horn. At the age of 17, he was accepted as a student for music theory and conducting at the Semperoper opera house in Dresden. He earned his first paycheck as a horn player playing Richard Wagner operas as an ensemble musician. After completing his education, he volunteered for the state theater in Gotha, after which he moved to the Reußisch-Fürstliche Theater in Gera. The Great Depression forced him to give up his position. Walter moved to Berlin, where he studied the techniques of silent film accompaniment from Giuseppe Becce; however, with the advent of sound film, his career as silent film accompanist never came to fruition. Walter applied to the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he received a scholarship to study under Arnold Schoenberg. Although he rehearsed two of Schoenberg's operas in the Kroll Opera House, Walter categorically rejected dodecaphony. After his training under Schoenberg, Walter worked as musician in German kabarett, variety shows, and circus. He also was an accompanist for various vocal ensembles, including the Humoresk Melodios and Comedian Harmonists. In 1933, Walter married the Dutch cabaret performer Elisabeth Stuy. When the National Socialists came to power, Walter avoided all contact with the party and military, which helped him receive a position as a freelancer for the Rundfunksender Leipzig radio station. During his time as a freelancer, he took lessons under Hermann Ambrosius at the Leipzig Conservatory. He lived in the Netherlands for a short period of time with his wife, where he was unable to find work as an expatriate from Germany. In 1938, he composed the opera Königin Elisabeth (Queen Elizabeth), which one year later was performed at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm with the attendance of the King of Sweden Gustav V. After the great success of his opera, the conductor Heinz Tietjen commissioned Walter to compose a new stage work, which also ensured that Walter would not be drafted into the German military. The opera Andreas Wolfius premiered at the Berlin State Opera in 1940. In 1943, Walter went to Prague and directed his ballet Kleopatra (Cleopatra). Walter Fried's success as a composer led to his name being compiled in Adolf Hitler's infamous August 1944 Gottbegnadeten list, which venerated artists important to the Nazi party. Despite his veneration by the Nazi Party, Walter was not classified as a Belastete (offender) by the allied forces during denazification at the end of World War II, so he was able to receive a post at the Berlin State Opera as a répétiteur and concert pianist. There he premiered his ballet Der Pfeil (The Arrow). In 1947, he was hired at the broadcasting station RIAS, which was established by the allied forces. He worked there for 25 years as a music director, conductor, and arranger of musical pieces. There he met his second wife Edith. His recordings with the RIAS radio orchestra include classics such as the operetta Zigeunerliebe (Gypsy Love) and the ballet Swan Lake, and many young composers premiering their works through the German broadcaster ARD recorded with his orchestra. In addition, Walter performed throughout West Germany and Austria. His last opera Die fünf Bräute (The Five Brides) premiered in 1998 under the direction of Claus Martin, with musical direction by Franns Wilfried Promnitz. After the reunification of Germany, Walter's hometown of Ottendorf- Okrilla honored him as an exemplary citizen, and after his death in 1996, the town commemorated a street in his honor. He is buried in the Friedhof Dahlem cemetery in Berlin.  References  * Mathias Henke: Das große Buch der Zupfmusik. Schwingestein-Verlag, p. 153 * Heinrich Vogel: Fried Walter.

A variety of books were printed using old-metal types, including classical novels, modern novels, how-to books, religious publications, and translations. In the late 19th century, lead was considered a new type metal, and as a result, some scholars refer to old metal types as simply “metal types” or “new metal types.” However, considering that lead types were eventually replaced with copper types and computer typesetting in the 1980s, lead-type print is generally referred to as old metal-type print. In old metal-type prints, the sizes of the types are smaller than before, which reduced the gap between the types as well, therefore increasing the amount of information that can be contained within a page. The printing process sped up, and the number of copies increased exponentially. In addition, the topics of the printed books became diversified. Among them, old metal-type print classical novels refer to the novels that were mass-produced by publishers for profits in the early 20th century. They consist of foreign and Korean novels, their adaptations, or narrative stories based on the classics or historical incidents. Peddlers and merchants supplied the books directly to the readers at low price. These books were also referred to as iyagichaek (story books), ttakjibon (paper tile books), yunjeonsoseol (six penny novels). Ttakjibon was a name given to the books due to the colorful covers, similar to the paper tiles (ttakji) used in games, and yukjeonsoseol was a name printed on the books published by Sinmungwan but came to be used to refer to old metal-type print classic novels in general.  History  Modern metal-type printing in Joseon began with the publication of the newspaper Hanseong sunbo from the Ministry of Presswork and Publication (bangmunguk) in 1883. After 1905, private publishers began to be established, and novels began to be printed in 1906. Old metal-type classical novels were most vigorously printed and sold from 1915 to 1918. After 1927, they gradually declined in popularity and number, were occasionally published in the 1930s and onward, eventually coming to a full stop in 1978. Interestingly, publishers that were active in the 1920s are smaller in number compared to the 1910s. Some of these publishers continued to print classical novels even after the 1930s, but the percentage of classical novels among their publications was greatly reduced. As mentioned above, old metal-type classical novels were most actively printed and distributed in the 1910s and 1920s. The publication of 328 classical novels can be confirmed, with over 2000 copies. Including the number of publications whose existence can be indirectly confirmed through advertisements, a total of 381 classical novels were printed over 3000 times. Among them, Chunhyang-jeon (The Tale of Chunhyang) has been confirmed to have been printed the most at 109 times, and estimated to have been printed over 167 times, based on including information from indirect sources, such as advertisements. Old metal-type print classic novels included typeset print versions of handwritten books but were often adaptations of the original handwritten classic novels. Old metal-type print classic novels can be classified into three groups: 1. Typeset print versions of handwritten books; 2. Adaptations of handwritten novels; and 3. Completely new novels that are based on classical novels.  Features and significance  Old type-set print classical novels were criticized for their low literary value compared to sinsoseol (modern fiction, literally “new fiction”), but they were far more popular compared to sinsoseol and widely distributed throughout the era. If the history of literature focuses on the readers’ acceptance of literature, old type-set print classical novels are at the center of Korea's early modern literary history. The popularity of old type-set print classical novels is also related to the historical background of the time. With the abolition of the class system and the gradual expansion of educational opportunities, hangeul (Korean alphabet) began to be disseminated, which seems to have played an important role in the prevalence of novels written in hangeul. In addition, the censorship system seems to have played a part. Prior to the signing of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, Japan tried to control the freedom of the press in Korea through the enactment of the Newspaper Act in 1907 and the Publication Act in 1909. Although the censorship system was put in place, classical novels were relatively freer from censorship compared to sinsoseol and began to be printed in full swing after 1912. Publishing capital in early modern Korea adopted lead-type printing technology, which allowed them to mass-print books within a short period, and sold old metal-type print classical novels to make a huge profit. Compared to handwritten editions, printed editions required far lower less production costs, and this led to reduced prices of books as well as mass-production, distribution, and consumption of books. This production method enabled the repeated publication of popular works and solidified the popularity of novels in readers’ minds.

It would have been the 50th edition of the singles event and the 45th edition of the doubles competition, contested by eight singles players and eight doubles teams. However, the tournament was cancelled by the WTA, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 24 July 2020. Tournament The 2020 WTA Finals takes place at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center the week of October 26, 2020, and is the 50th edition of the event. The tournament is run by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) as part of the 2020 WTA Tour. Shenzhen is the tenth city to host the WTA Finals since the tournament's inauguration in 1972. Qualifying In the singles, point totals are calculated by combining point totals from sixteen tournaments. Of these sixteen tournaments, a player's results from the four Grand Slam events, the four Premier Mandatory tournaments, and (for the top 20 players at the end of 2019) the best results from two Premier 5 tournaments must be included. In the doubles, point totals are calculated by any combination of eleven tournaments throughout the year. Unlike in the singles, this combination does not need to include results from the Grand-Slam or Premier-level tournaments. Format Both the singles and doubles event features eight players/teams in a round robin event, split into two groups of four. Over the first four days of competition, each player/team meets the other three players/teams in her group, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. The first-placed player/team in one group meets the second-placed player/team in the other group, and vice versa. The winners of each semifinal meet in the championship match. Round robin tie-breaking methods The final standings are made using these methods: # Greatest number of [match] wins. # Greatest number of matches played. # Head-to-head results if only two players are tied, or if three players are tied then: ::a. If three players each have the same number of wins, a player having played less than all three matches is automatically eliminated and the player advancing to the single elimination competition is the winner of the match-up of the two remaining tied players. ::b. Highest percentage of sets won. ::c. Highest percentage of games won. Prize money and points The total prize money for the BNP Paribas WTA Finals 2019 is US$14,000,000.

Although it is offset by the Tan-Lu fault zone, it stretches through the Sulu region of the Shandong Peninsula and reaches South Korea. The orogeny is the largest area ultrahigh pressure metamorphic belt in the world. Low-temperature, but high-pressure conditions led rocks to reach eclogite-grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. The added presence of diamonds and felsic gneiss indicates deep burial up to 100 kilometers below the surface. The China Continental Scientific Drilling Project was approved in China's ninth Five-Year Plan in 1997, with the CCSD-1 well inaugurated on 25 June 2001 drilling into the Dabie-Sulu orogen at Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province. The goal of the project throughout the 2000s was to collect data about rheology and mantle mineralogy, as well as study processes similar to those in the center of the Himalayas, but at lower cost.

She is also the founder of the political consulting firm Chalupa & Associates, LLC. Chalupa is a pro-Ukrainian activist. Prominent supporters of President Donald Trump have, without evidence, promoted the theory that Chalupa's past activities were part of a conspiracy between the DNC and the Ukrainian government to undermine Trump's campaign and, later, to frame the Russian government for the hacking of the DNC during the 2016 US presidential campaign.  Early life  Chalupa was born in Davis, California, to Tanya Keis and Leo M. Chalupa, both Ukrainian immigrants. Tanya was born in a United Nations refugee camp in Heidenheim, Germany after World War II. Tanya's and Leo's parents brought them to the United States as children seeking asylum from the Soviet Union, and they grew up in the Bronx, New York. As a couple, they moved to California, where Leo earned a PhD in neuroscience from UCLA and became a professor at UC Davis. When Chalupa was 2–1/2, her life was saved by a child car seat when her parent's car spun out of control and crashed while traversing the Alps in Italy. The incident led her mother to single-handedly wage a successful 2-year lobbying campaign in the California legislature for a mandatory child safety seat law that passed in 1982. Chalupa attended Davis Senior High School, pursued peace and conflict studies at UC Berkeley, and received her J.D. degree from UC Davis.  Career   Paul Manafort and Donald Trump   2016 presidential election  In 2014, Chalupa began to research the Ukraine crisis for a pro bono client unrelated to the DNC. The research included Paul Manafort, his work for Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, and his connections to pro-Russian oligarchs. After Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, she expanded her research to include Trump and his ties to Russia. She began warning Ukrainian-American community leaders in January 2016 that Manafort was Russian president Vladimir Putin’s \\"political brain for manipulating U.S. foreign policy and elections.\\" She also shared her concerns with a senior DNC official, saying that a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia would likely mean Manafort would become involved in the election. Near the end of March, she visited the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to organize an event in June highlighting female Ukrainian leaders. While there, she shared her concerns with Ambassador Valeriy Chaly and his aide Oksana Shulyar. Manafort joined the Trump campaign a few days later as its convention manager. The day after the campaign announced Manafort's joining, Chalupa briefed the DNC's communications staff on Manafort's and Trump's ties to Russia. A week later, Chalupa met with a foreign policy legislative assistant to Representative Marcy Kaptur in a failed attempt to start a congressional investigation into Manafort's activities. After the election, Chalupa assisted the Clinton campaign with their efforts to force vote recounts in some states. On September 14, 2016, Chalupa was interviewed by an agent from the FBI.  Ukrainian embassy  The Ukrainian embassy assisted Chalupa with her research, though the extent and nature of the assistance are in dispute. According to Politico, the DNC encouraged Chalupa to ask the Ukrainian embassy to arrange a call with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to discuss Manafort, Trump, and their connections to Russia, but the embassy declined. Andrii Telizhenko, a Ukrainian political officer who worked under Shulyar at the time, told Politico that she asked him to pass on to Chalupa any information he came across about connections between Trump, Manafort, and Russia. He claimed the embassy was coordinating with Chalupa and the Clinton campaign on investigating Manafort. In 2018, Telizhenko told the Ukrainian news site Strana.UA that Poroshenko worked with Chalupa to discredit Trump. He began repeating the story in 2019 to U.S. right-wing media, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and House Intelligence Committee minority chair Devin Nunes. Both the embassy and Chalupa disputed the allegations. Ambassador Chaly denied any wrongdoing and called Telizhenko a liar. Chalupa denied that the DNC asked her to collect information from the embassy.  Intimidation campaign  In late April 2016, Chalupa began receiving daily administrative alerts from Yahoo! warning her that state actors were attempting to break into her email account. After two weeks of daily alerts, she informed the DNC about the hacking attempts. That email became public when WikiLeaks published stolen DNC emails in July. The alerts continued into 2017. In June 2016, someone broke into and searched her car, but left everything behind. She became convinced it was Russia-linked when two more family cars were broken into and ransacked but nothing was stolen. A few days later, a woman \\"wearing white flowers in her hair\\" tried to break into Chalupa's home. She mentioned the incident to Shulyar, who told her it resembled intimidation campaigns used against foreigners in Russia. Chalupa began receiving death threats in the second half of 2016.  FEC complaints  The conservative watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust filed a complaint against Chalupa and the DNC with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in August 2017. The complaint alleges that the research assistance the Ukrainian embassy provided to her during the 2016 election campaign was an illegal campaign contribution to the DNC because of her work for them at the time. The pro- Trump super PAC Committee to Defend the President filed a similar FEC complaint against the DNC in September 2019, alleging that the DNC ordered Chalupa to investigate Manafort and Trump. Like the 2017 complaint, it is largely a mischaracterization of the 2017 Politico article detailing her research efforts.  Calls for DOJ investigation  U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) on two occasions to investigate alleged coordination between Chalupa and the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. In July 2017, he sent a letter in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley and Senator Ron Johnson sent a second letter in September 2019 in their capacities as the chairs of the Senate Finance and Homeland Security Committees. Both letters cite the 2017 Politico article as evidence.  Impeachment Inquiry  During the US Congress' 2019 Impeachment Inquiry hearings, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes several times cited Alexandra Chalupa as a fact witness that committee chairman Adam Schiff refused to bring before the committee. Chalupa responded that she would welcome the opportunity to testify and push back against the Republican narrative about her involvement with Ukrainian officials. There is no evidence that Ukrainian embassy officials helped Chalupa in any significant way or that the DNC used any information obtained by Chalupa to aid Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign against Trump.

It is about a person possessed by the spirit of a dead person who tells the story of the underworld. In the sixth year in the reign of King Jungjong (1511), this novel was classified as a book that confuses and misleads people and burned by the king’s decree, and its author Chae Su was dismissed from office.  Authorship  Seol Gongchan-jeon was written by Chae Su, a civil official of the Joseon Dynasty, before 1511. Chae Su’s ja, or familiar name, is Giji (耆之), ho, or brush-name, is Najae (懶齋), and siho, or temple name, is Yangjeong (襄靖). He was born as the eldest son of Cha Sinbo (蔡申報) and his wife Mun Hwaryu in Seoul, Korea, in the 31st year of the reign of King Sejong (1449). In the 14th year in the reign of King Sejo (1468), Chae Su passed saengwonsi, a “classics licentiate” civil service examination, received the highest passing mark in the regular literary civil service examinations held every three years, known as singnyeonsi, in the first year in the reign of King Yejong (1469), and became an inspector at the Office of Inspector- General. In the first year in the reign of King Seongjong (1470), he became the sixth counselor in the Office of Royal Decrees and later the fifth counselor in the Ministry of Punishments. He was also involved in the compilation of the Sejo sillok (Annals of King Sejo) and Seongjong sillok (Annals of King Seongjong). In the 13th year in the reign of King Seongjong (1482), Chae Su became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In the same year, he asserted that Yeonsangun’s mother, the deposed Queen Yun (廢妃尹氏) should be given food and a place to live for the rest of her life, incurring the king’s anger, and ended up resigning from his post. In 1485, Chae became the governor of Chungcheong Province. After his visits to Ming China as part of the delegations to pay tribute to the Ming Emperor on the occasions of the New Year and the emperor’s birthday, he served as the headmaster of Seonggyungwan and eventually became the Second Minister of Taxation (hojo champan). After Yeonsangun rose to the throne, Chae was able to survive the Literary Purge of 1498 by keeping a low profile in the royal court. During the Purge of 1504 in the 10th year in the reign of Yeonsangun, he was framed and exiled in Danseong but was eventually released. In 1506, he took part in a coup to enthrone King Jungjong and was recorded in history as a meritorious subject who was involved in tranquilizing the state and received the title of Incheongun. That year, Chae resigned from his post and moved to Hamchang, where he built Kwaejaejeong (快哉亭, “pleasant pavilion”) in the following year and retreated from the world. In the sixth year in the reign of King Jungjong (1511), he was impeached for having written Seol Gongchan-jeonand passed away in Hamchang in the 10th year in the reign of King Jungjong (1515).  Plot  Seol Chungran lived in Sunchang with a son and daughter. His daughter married but died without a child and his son Gongchan also died from illness even before he was wed. Feeling sorry for his son, Seol makes a spirit tablet for his son, mourns him for three years, and buries it next to his grave. Seol Chungran’s younger brother Seol Chungsu has two sons, the first of whom is named Gongchim. On July 7, 1508, Gongchim visits his father. While in the outhouse, he becomes possessed by the spirit of Chungran’s dead daughter. Chungsu summons an exorcist named Kim Seoksan who tries to drive out the spirit from Gongchim’s body. When the exorcism rite is performed, Chungran’s daughter leaves Gongchim, saying that she cannot win against the exorcist as she is a woman and that she will bring her brother Gongchan. As Gongchan’s spirit begins to possess Gongchim’s body, Chungsu calls on Kim Seoksan again. Enraged at Chungsu’s attempt to drive him away from Gongchim’s body, Gongchan transforms Gongchim’s body. Horrified, Chungsu swears never to summon Kim again, and Gongchim’s body returns to its original state. Gongchan then sends a letter to his cousins Seolwon and Yun Jasin and tells them about the underworld: 1) The underworld is located by the ocean and about 40 li (approximately 10 miles) from Sunchang; 2) The underworld is called Danwolguk (檀越國) and is ruled by Bisamuncheonwang; 3) When people die, they are whipped by an iron whip and questioned about their lives. They are taken to the underworld if their lives are truly over. Gongchan says he was taken to the underworld but was released thanks to his great-grandfather Seolwi; 4) In the underworld, women can learn to read and write and they can also serve in government posts; 5) People’s treatment in the underworld depends on how they lived in this world; 6) Emperor Seonghwa sent his servant Aebagi to King Yeomla and requested that Yeomla prolong the life of his beloved servant by a year. King Yeomla was enraged at the request, and when Emperor Seonghwa came to see Yeomla, Yeomla brought Amugae in and ordered his servants to boil Amugae’s hand (The rest of the story is unavailable).  Features and Significance  Seol Gongchan-jeon was banned in the Joseon Dynasty. There are various assumptions about the reason it was banned, one of which is its huge impact when it was published in vernacular Korean and distributed throughout Korea. As it was published in the 16th century, it is also considered a work that bridges the gap between Geumo sinhwa (金鰲新話Tales of Mount Geumo) written in the 15th century and other novels that were popular in the 17th century. The fact that it was written in Chinese characters but translated into hangeul and published also shows the trend of novels from being written in Chinese characters to vernacular Korean. As it tells the story of the underworld, Seol Gongchan-jeon was often compared to Namyeombujuji (南炎浮洲志 Records of South Yeombuju) in Geumo sinhwa.  Other  Jiridadopadopa Seol Gongchan-jeon, a play based on Seol Gongchan-jeon, was premiered in 2003. In 2015, Seol Gongchan hwanhonjeon (A Story about the Return of Seol Gongchan’s Spirit) was serialized as a web novel on Naver, which is a recreation of the story from Seol Gongchan-jeon.  Text  In 1996, Professor Lee Bokgyu discovered a handwritten version of parts of Seol Gongchan-jeon from the third volume of Mukjae ilgi (Journal entries from 1545 to 1546). The discovery was reported via a newspaper on April 27, 1997, and introduced to the academia. Seol Gongchan-jeon seems to have been written in Chinese characters originally, but due to the government censorship the original version does not exist and the copy that was found in Mukjae ilgi is the only existing copy that remains today.

The main narrative centers on the married life of So Hyeonseong and his wives. So Hyeonseong-rok, which tells the story of So Hyeonseong and his wives and Sossi samdae-rok (소씨삼대록 Story of Three Generations of the So Family), which contain stories about So Hyeonseong’s children and their wives, were combined together and circulated as one book, titled So Hyeonseong-rok.  Authorship  Although the identity of the author is unknown, So Hyeonseong-rok is assumed to have been written in the 17th century, as So Hyeonseong-rok daesoseol sibochaek (蘇賢聖錄大小說十五冊 Fifteen Volumes of the Great Story of So Hyeonseong), which refers to the combination of both the So Hyeonseong-rok and Sossi samdae-rok, is mentioned in the list of novels that Lady Yi from Yongin, the mother of Kwon Seop (penname Okso), personally transcribed to hand down to her children. In addition, it is estimated that So Hyeonseong-rok was written in the late 17th century at the latest, as research revealed that a handwritten edition of Hanssi samdae-rok (韓氏三代錄 Story of Three Generations of the Han Family), a novel based on So Hyeonseong-rok, was written in 1692.  Plot  So Hyeonseong-rok narrates the story of the life of So Hyeonseong. So Gwang and Madame Yang marry, but they are unable to have children for a long time. Years later, they finally have three children: two daughters named So Wolyeong and So Gyoyeong, and a son named So Hyeonseong. But before So Hyeonseong is born, his father passes away, leaving Madame Yang all alone to raise all three children. As the head of the family, Madame Yang raises her children with strict standards. In one incident, So Gyoyeong’s father-in-law commits treason. As a result, So Gyoyeong’s husband is killed and Gyoyeong is sent on an exile, where she becomes intimate with another man. Upon finding out about the affair, Madame Yang orders her own daughter to drink poison. In such a strict way, she keeps up the position and reputation of the So family. Showered with his mother’s teachings and love, So Hyeonseong grows up to be a wise man. He passes the civil service exam and becomes a bureaucrat. He marries Hwa Sueun. But Seokpa, concubine to So Hyeonseong’s father, is dissatisfied with Hwa Sueun’s looks and personality and arranges for her niece Seok Myeonghye to be So Hyeonseong’s second wife. Upset about the whole incident, Hwa Sueun finds herself at odds with So Hyeonseong and Seokpa, but Seok Myeonghye wisely manages the situation and appeases all three. But a serious problem arises when So Hyeonseong takes Madame Yeo as his third wife at the order of the emperor. Madame Yeo conspires against Hwa Sueun and Seok Myeonghye, who suffers more in particular. When Madame Yeo’s evil schemes are revealed, she is kicked out of the family, and Seok Myeonghye returns home with all charges against her cleared. As a bureaucrat, So Hyeonseong continues to advance his career, serves his mother devotedly, manages the household well, and builds his family’s reputation. Sossisamdae-rok tells the stories of So Hyeonseong’s children and grandchildren, or the second and third generation of the So Family. The book mainly focuses on the married couples in the second generation of the So Family. So Ungyeong marries his betrothed Wi Seonhwa, who is threatened by her stepmother; So Unseong is married to his beloved Hyeong Ganga but is forced to marry Princess Myeonghyeon by the order of the emperor, which causes conflicts in his marriage; So Unmyeong abuses his virtuous wife Yi Okju when the envious Jeong Gangseon slanders her; and So Subing becomes Kim Hyeon’s second wife after years of Kim’s courtship, but is ostracized by Kim’s first wife and family, and is only accepted by the family after years of hardship. There are only short anecdotes about the third generation of the Yu Family in So Hyeongseong-rok. When So Semyeong, one of the third generation, plots treason against the emperor, So Unseong finds out and kills him to eliminate misfortune in the family. The So Family prospers afterward, giving birth to famous literary men during the Song Dynasty.  Features and Significance  So Hyeonseong-rok was widely read in the late Joseon Dynasty. Other novels, such as Hanssisamdae-rok, Yeongi-rok (靈異錄 Story of Yeongi), and Seolssisamdae-rok (Story of Three Generations of the Seol Family) feature characters from So Hyeonseong-rok, and the novel Yeowa-rok (女媧錄 Story of Yeowa) and the song cycle Gwabu-ga (寡婦歌 Song of a Widow) also contain criticisms of So Hyeonseong-rok. Based on the plot of So Hyeonseong-rok, the song cycle Jaun-ga (Song of Jaun) was composed and enjoyed. All this attests to the popularity of So Hyeonseong-rok in the late Joseon Dynasty. In addition, So Hyeonseong-rok occupies an important position in the history of Korean literature. As one of the earliest novels written in Korea, alongside Guunmong (九雲夢The Cloud Dream of the Nine), Sassi namjeonggi (謝氏南征記Record of Lady Sa’s Southward Journey), Changseongamui-rok (彰善感義錄 Story of Inspiration from Good and Righteous Deeds), it is considered to have created a new literary tradition. Characters’ personalities, conflicts between married couples, focus on the family, and other aspects of the novel in terms of characters, events, and themes that are now described as characteristic of hangeul novels were established in So Hyeonseong-rok. Therefore So Hyeonseong- rok is the first novel in the genre of hangeul novels that tell the story of several generations of an upper-class family. Similar hangeul novels were written and appreciated even until the 18th and 19th centuries in Joseon Korea.  Other  There is another novel titled Sossisamdae-rok (蘇氏三代錄 Story of Three Generations of the So Family), but it is a completely different work about calligraphy and literature of So Sun (蘇洵, pinyin: Su Xun), a literati from Song China, his sons So Sik (蘇軾, pinyin: Su Shi) and So Cheol (蘇轍, pinyin: Su Zhe), and their sons.  Texts  There are over 20 different editions of So Hyeonseong-rok, which are all handwritten editions. Five of them are complete sets, and of the five the one housed at Ewha Woman’s University, consisting of fifteen chapters and fifteen volumes, is the most widely read for its detailed narrative and a stable plot.

Senegal has been a member of the World Bank since August 31, 1962. Senegal is located in West Africa and shares borders with Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau. Senegal also surrounds Gambia and has shorelines along the Atlantic Ocean.  Senegal  Senegal has stood out as one of the most politically stable countries in the region since their independence in 1960. Senegal has also been able to remain largely unaffected by regional security shocks. However, increasing organized terrorist activity in neighboring countries could introduce the risk of instability. Since 2014 Senegal has experienced a growth rate of a minimum 6% with positive future projections. The growth rate accelerated to 7% in 2017 and maintained at 6% during 2018. Growth projections in Senegal are expected to continue as offshore oil and gas operations are expected to begin in 2022. Until then, Senegal is facing fiscal pressure due to fixed domestic energy prices that are cheaper than international oil prices resulting in increased subsidies and lower revenues. The deficit for Senegal increased to 3.5% for the year 2018, growing half a percent from the previous year 2017. Public debt continues to grow in Senegal but remains listed as a low risk of distress due to GDP rebasing. Senegal was able to increase GDP by 30% through rebasing with Eurobond. Debt was estimated to be 60.6% of GDP in 2017 and increased to 64.5% in 2018. Senegal's poverty rate was last measured in 2011 and had a national poverty rate of 46.7% and 38% using the international poverty line. No new household consumption data has been made available but, estimates place the poverty rate at 34% in 2017, and expect it to fall to 31% in 2020. Senegal has also seen an increase in primary education enrollment from 69.3% in 2000 to 80.95% in 2018. Senegal has also seen an increase in life expectancy at birth from 57% in 2000 to 67.38% in 2017.  History with World Bank  Senegal has had a long history of cooperation with the World Bank and is currently engaged in over 30 projects from the World Bank. In addition, the estimated total cost of the projects currently active form the World Bank is estimated to be $1.8 billion dollars. Senegal has also established similar indicators of progress to that of the World Bank. The World Bank initiated the World Bank Group's Human Capital Project as a global effort to increase the effectiveness and development of human capital through policymaking and investing. This initiative focuses on helping countries achieve these goals and has even established its own set of indicators to track and monitor progress. In order to be able to measure the success of the program, the World Bank established a Human Capital Index (HCI). The HCI targets how human capital contributes to the production of the economy as well as the projections for the future. The three main indicators are; (1) survival, (2) school, and (3) health. In following these guidelines Senegal has been approved for projects that address and focus on these three issues.  Select programs   National Social Safety Net System  In order to provide financial security to the most vulnerable people and poor regions, the International Development Association (IDA) approved a $40.5 million credit package to aid Senegal in the establishment of a national social safety net system. The safety net functions as a conditional cash transfer program that provides qualified candidates with 25,000 West African CFS francs or $50 USD every quarter for 5 years. A condition of the program is that children are required to attend school during the 5 years. The Government of Senegal established the program to provide financial security for the poor and education opportunities. The beneficiaries of the program are selected by using community and geographical data that provides guidelines for selecting the most vulnerable and in need people. In 2016, of the 280,000 households in the registry, 180,000 were already receiving the benefits from the program. An added benefit of the program is the new capacity to respond to crises. Cash transfers can be used as tools to respond to humanitarian crises and create new methods of more immediate and required responses according to needs. On January 3, 2019 the IDA approved a second round of financing for the social safety net program and loaned another credit package of $57 million USD. The extension of funds were to address specific issues in regards to sustainability, institutionalization, and upscale of the use of the key frameworks. Component 1 of this project was to establish the Safety Net System and has so far been a success. Component 2 of the project was aimed at being able to provide a cash transfer service for low income households and has been able to provide transfers to farmers, beneficiaries, and as a use for productive exchanges.  Senegal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project  The development objective of this project is to be able to provide people from rural communities with safe and equitable water sanitation and services. This project also focuses on providing people with proper methods of water resource management as well as oversight of water services. The project was approved on June 22, 2018 at an estimated total cost of $130 million USD. In many countries water is still not a fully guaranteed utility due to social economic barriers that make it difficult to provide water to all people. The main barriers to universal access in Senegal are the lack of funds for the government to maintain and provide consistent water to rural communities as well as lack of funds for rural communities to be able to seek private investment form resource providers. There are four main components to this project that address the issues of water access. The first component is the improvement of the rural water supply system that requires the upgrading of already existing systems as well as opening new routes for accessibility. The second component focuses on sanitation services and provides rural communities with household ad community toilets to be able to maintain clean water sources and clean communities. The third component of this project discusses the issues wth water resource management and provides the community with training on water management and pre-planning for water resource use and allocation. The final component of this project prepares the community for project coordination and increased capacity building so that the needs of the community can be fulfilled with the water supply systems and training of the community.  Investing in Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health  Senegal in September 26, 2019 received a $140 million USD loan from the IDA to expand the government capacity for nutritional services for women and kids. The project seeks to provide necessary funds for government projects aimed at improving the health and nutritional condition of women and children in low socioeconomic areas. The first component of the project is to improve the availability and quality of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) packages. This component will seek to achieve this by increasing the availability and quality of health workers, mobile midwives, and medical resources available so that rural communities are also receiving the same level of care as urban communities. The second component of this project is to promote adolescent health and women’s empowerment. The project has developed multiple strategies to implement this component through the use of mass media, social and behavioral changes in communities, life and employment skills training, and cash transfers to adolescent girls to help keep them in school or to enroll them in schools. The third component is Supporting reforms to strengthen governance, equity, and financing sustainability in the health sector. The project seeks to remove any previous barriers that barred people from necessary services.

Authorship  The identity of the author is unknown. The specific time period in which Yu Chungryeol-jeon was written is also unknown but is presumed to be the 19th century or later, considering that most existing editions of the story are from around 1900, and Sangseogimun (象胥記聞 Record of a Translator) (1794), written by a Japanese translator from Tsushima named Ikugoro Oda (小田幾五郞, 1754-1831) listed a number of Korean heroic novels such as So Daeseong jeon (蘇大成傳Tale of So Daeseong) and Jang Pungun-jeon (張豐雲傳 Tale of Jang Pungun) but did not include Yu Chungryeol-jeon.  Plot  Yu Sim, who lived during the reign of Emperor Yingzong of Ming, had no child. He prayed to the heavens for a child at Yeonhwa Peak on Mount Heng, known as the southern mountain of the Five Great Mountains, and gains a son, whom he names Chungryeol. Around this time, two treacherous courtiers Jeong Handam and Choe Ilgwi frame Yu Sim for a crime, and Yu Sim is exiled. His wife Jang struggles to make a living with young Chungryeol, but the two are separated. Separated from his mother and left all alone, Yu Chungryeol begs for a living and eventually turns 14. Around this time, he is rescued by Prime Minister Gang Hui-ju and marries Kang’s daughter. In the year Yu Chungryeol turns 15, Kang petitions the emperor about the unfairness of Yu Sim’s exile but is also banished. Chungryeol also leaves home to avoid the ensuing hardship, and the whole Kang family is separated. Prime Minister Kang’s wife drowns and their daughter is left alone in a near-death state until she is eventually rescued by a government slave. After escaping alone, Yu Chungryeol meets an elderly monk at Baengryongsa Temple and studies under him. When the enemies from the south and the north invade the country, Jeong Handam and Choe Ilgwi surrender to the enemies and tryto force the emperor to surrender as well. At this time, Yu Chungryeol fights and defeats the enemies, chases after the enemies who took the empress and the empress dowager as hostages, and rescues them. On the way back, he also rescues his father and Prime Minister Kang from exile and reunites with his mother and wife as well. Yu Chungryeol becomes the Grand Marshal and gains great honor and riches.  Features and significance  While some consider Yu Chungryeol-jeon to be a story about the fall of yangban and the lower class’s desire for upward mobility, others see it as a story about a family’s separation during the war and eventual reunion. Yu Chungryeol-jeon is classified as a war (gundam) novel or heroic novel. A war novel is a novel in which stories of the battlefield account for a major part of the narrative. Depending on the origin, war novels are classified into original war novels, historical war novels, and adapted (translated) war novels. All feature battles or wars, in which the main characters take an active part. A heroic novel, on the other hand, refers to a novel that tells the life story of a hero with the following characteristics: 1) Noble lineage, 2) extraordinary or supernatural birth, 3) outstanding talent, 4) abandonment as a child, 5) rescued by a helper, 6) crisis in adulthood, and 7) success through a struggle. Depending on the origin, heroic novels are classified into historical heroic novels and original heroic novels. War novels and heroic novels tend to be one and the same, but there are several that are classified as either war novels or heroic novels. Yu Chungryeol-jeon is considered an original heroic novel and an original war novel, along with Jo Ung-jeon and So Daeseong-jeon.  Other  There is a seosamuga (epic shamanic song) titled Chungryeol-gut, which is one of the many seosamuga sang by Yi Gobun, a shaman from the Hamheung area, during mangmukgut, a ritual for appeasing the dead observed in Hamgyeong Province. In addition, Yu Chungryeol-mindam (A Folktale of Yu Chungryeol) is included in An Outline of Oral Literature: Hwasun, South Jeolla Province (구비문학대계, 전라남도 화순편).  Texts  Yu Chungryeol-jeon exists in various forms, including pilsabon (handwritten), banggakbon (woodblock printing), and hwaljabon (metal-type printing) editions. There is not much difference between the stories in the different editions. Woodblock print editions are all wanpanbon, or editions printed in the Jeonju area. Handwritten editions include those written in Chinese characters. The metal- type print editions of Yu Chungryeol-jeon have been published over 20 times and is the second most printed book after Jo Ung-jeon, which attests to its popularity at the time it was written.

History  The group was founded between cafeteria worker and labor organizer Rachel Melendes and engineer Matt Schaefer. Their first meetings began in 2014 in its members' apartments. The group set out to create an alternative to the Californian Ideology that emphasized worker labor. The group's name emphasizes the ideas that white-collar employees are workers and that the lower-wage jobs created to support those white-collar jobs are part of the same industry. These ideas are in contrast to industry norms that ameliorate engineer working conditions, including food and perk luxuries on campus, horizontal reporting structures, and casual dress codes. Engineers at big tech companies are also often separated from the blue-collar independent contractors who provide the campus services. The group also responds to the disillusionment of workers who entered the industry to bring societal value through the Internet but instead found other company objectives to be paramount. In 2015, the Tech Workers Coalition focused its efforts on organizing Hyatt hotel workers in Santa Clara, California. The presidential election of Donald Trump accelerated membership in the Tech Workers Coalition. Many workers at major tech companies saw themselves as responsible for creating platforms that let fake news propagate, the alt-right find an audience, and the Trump presidency potentially surveil its critics. Photos from a December 2016 Trump Tower meeting between United States President-elect Donald Trump and senior leaders of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook renewed interest in counter-activism. The Tech Workers Coalition began to focus on organizing engineers. In January 2017, the group led a protest of 70 people, including employees from major tech companies, at the data analytics company Palantir in opposition to the company's surveillance work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Tech Workers Coalition started a petition for Stanford University alumni, a popular recruiting spot, to pledge not to join Palantir. This Palantir protest work continued into 2019. The Tech Workers Coalition prominently participated in Bay Area May Day demonstrations. In early 2017, several Tech Workers Coalition members assisted the labor union Unite Here in organizing cafeteria staff at their companies, particularly at Facebook. The members pledged their support, made public gestures of solidarity at the company, and collected union cards. By July, the Facebook cafeteria workers had unionized. The Tech Workers Coalition joined other organizations for a workshop series, \\"Tech Won't Built It\\", in which tech workers shared lessons in convincing their companies to cease work on controversial government projects. In 2019, the Tech Workers Coalition advised NPM employees behind a failed unionization attempt and helped to organize tech worker presence at the September 2019 climate strikes. Within the movement of tech industry activists seeking to change the industry's practices through their employees, the Tech Workers Coalition is the most radical group. They train gig, contract, and full time workers to organize for better pay, conditions, and treatment in the tech sector. Their workshops include introductions to labor law and spaces to share workplace experiences. As of late 2017, the group had about 500 users on its instant messaging tool and had small chapters in cities including Boston, New York, and Seattle. The group is all-volunteer and horizontal, unlike most labor union hierarchies, and is premised on solidarity between higher-wage engineers and lower-wage workers.

They have mostly been poorer Latin American and Chinese immigrants.  History  Street vending became prominent in the latter half of the 19th century, after California became a state in 1850. Mexican and Chinese immigrants were some of the first street vendors in 1870. By 1890, the city tried to restrict their movement, but the food proved to be too popular. They continued to try to outlaw tamale carts into the next century. Most street vendors at the time stayed in downtown LA, but with the rise of the automobile they were able to spread out more. Tacos from street carts became big in the 1930’s. Chinese immigrants had a harder time because they were trapped in ghettos and attacks kept their population to just a few hundred. They were forced to migrate around the city and go up to people’s doors. Public health officials told people that their food was unsanitary and to not eat it. In the 1920’s, Olvera Street was revitalized and Chinese street vending disappeared, along with Chinatown being moved farther away. By the time of the Olympics in 1932 most of the street vendors had been run off. In 1994, councilman Mike Hernandez took over an initiative to allow street vending in MacArthur Park, Westlake, and Pico Union. Other council members worried that it would scare away brick and mortar businesses. To help assuage those fears they said that since more people would be on the street they would be able to tell police about crimes. In 1999, the Institute For Urban Research and Development was asked to manage the vending district in MacArthur Park. Right away there were several problems. Vendors were limited in where they could sell, meaning that they couldn’t follow crowds. They were also limited in what they could sell, meaning people didn’t want to participate in the program. The current movement to legalize street vending has been heavily influenced by actual street vendors. Four groups came together to fight for street vending to be legalized and created the Legalize Street Vending Campaign. Each group was able to contribute something different. The East LA Community Corporation helps to develop communities. The Los Angeles Food Policy Council looked at how legalizing street vending could help people gain access to healthy food. Public Council is a public interest law firm and is non-profit. The Leadership for Urban Renewal Network advocates for low-income communities and their economic development. Street vendors were quickly brought in to lead and advocate for street vending to be legalized. In 2012, they went to council members to find allies and help draft a policy proposal. The report was not considered a priority until the 2016 election. When Trump announced a deportation priority for anyone who’s committed a crime it was enough pressure for the council to vote in February 2017 to decriminalize it. The city pushed back against full legalization. They implemented two-vendor per block caps and allowed store owners to keep people from selling in front of their store. Certain sections of the city were also restricted. No one could sell on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, meaning people lost a huge source of income. After it became legalized they were still restricted from selling in Hollywood, but Legalize Street Vending Campaign continues to fight for venders to be able to sell with unique rules instead of being completely banned. For decades, street vending has been prominent throughout the history of Los Angeles and has played a significant role in the culture and economic growth of Los Angeles. Considering LA has a large Hispanic population, a large portion of street vendors today and in the past are, or were, of Mexican descent. Today there are over 50,000 different kinds of street vendors in LA; 10,000 of them selling food. It is often the first profession of immigrants in the city. The street vending micro-enterprises make up a $504 million industry. It has been estimated that over 5,000 jobs have been created by these street vendors and those they deal with.  Laws  In 2016, the city of Los Angeles decriminalized street vending. In November 2018, the city voted unanimously to legalize it. In September 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the Safe Sidewalk Vending Act, or SB 946, which decriminalized street vending in throughout the state. SB 946 limits violations and fines imposed on said vendors. Under these new laws, vendors will be required to have business licenses and health food permits. According to the rules, this is to keep merchants from “impeding with the flow of pedestrian activity” and require them to maintain “a clean area around their carts” according to Councilman Curran Price. Street vendors are prohibited from vending in specific areas such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Universal Studios, El Pueblo de Los Angeles, Staples Center, Dodger Stadium, the Hollywood Bowl, the Coliseum, and Banc of California Stadium on event days.

It emphasizes the familiar harmony, filial piety, and brotherly love. It seems to have been written and read before the early 18th century as a prequel to Yussi samdaerok (劉氏三代錄 The Story of Three Generations of the Yu Family).  Authorship  Yuhyogong seonhaengnok is estimated to have been written before the early 18th century by an anonymous author. As there are records of Yussisamdaerok in Yeolha ilgi (熱河日記 The Jehol Diary) written by Bak Jiwon (朴趾源, 1737-1805) and also in Hanjungnok (閑中錄 A Record of Sorrowful Days) written by Lady Hyegyeong (惠慶宮 洪氏, 1735-1815), Yuhyogong seonhaengnok was also assumed to have been written before the early to mid-18th century. Recently, a discovery of a section of Jemangsilmyomun (祭亡室墓文 A Funeral Oration to Dead Wife) written by Yu Sukgi (兪肅基, 1696-1752) was made in which the author mourned for his dead wife, mentioning the characters of Yussisamdaerok, allowing scholars to slightly narrow down the time in which Yuhyogong seonhaengnok was written to early 18th century or earlier.  Plot  There was a man named Yu Jeonggyeong, who lived in Ming China. He had two sons named Yu Yeon and Yu Hong. Yeon was a generous man and a dutiful son, but Hong was sly and prone to jealousy. When a conflict arises between Yeon and Hong due to a lawsuit handled by Yu Jeonggyeong, Yu makes a poor judgment and sides with Hong. Hong slanders his older brother, saying that Yeon takes bribes, tries to destroy Yeon’s marriage, and lies about how Yeon resents their father. Hearing all of this, Yu Jeonggyeong tries to name his younger son Hong as the rightful heir, and Yeon tries to cover for his father’s flaws by pretending to be insane. Later on, Yeon passes the civil service examination with the highest grade and becomes a teacher to the crowned prince. However, he soon falls ill. Yeon’s wife Jeong was kicked out and had to return to her family home due to Hong’s machinations, but instead of remarrying she runs away from home disguised as a man. When the emperor deposes the empress and avoids seeing the crown prince out of his infatuation with Concubine Mangwibi, Yeon admonishes the emperor’s actions and is exiled. While in exile, Yeon reunites with his wife who is dying. However, Hong spies on his older brother and tells their father about the two of them, and Yeon and his wife are separated once again. Around this time, the crown prince succeeds the throne and punishes Mangwibi and Yu Hong’s evil deeds. Yeon is reinstated as a government official. Yu Yeon worries about his younger brother Hong who has been exiled. He adopts Hong’s eldest son Yu Baekgyeong as his son and heir, loving him more than his own. Moved by Yeon’s brotherly love, the emperor frees Yu Hong from exile. Hong repents his terrible deeds and reconciles with his older brother, and peace finally settles on the Yu family, which prospers and flourishes.  Features and significance  Conflicts between father and son and brothers are at the heart of Yuhyogong seonhaengnok, and conflicts between brothers grow into conflicts between father and son. The younger brother’s inferiority complex and jealousy of his older brother spurs a conflict between the brothers, which grows into a conflict between father and son, but the conflicts are resolved by the older brother’s filial piety and brotherly love toward his father and younger brother. This story is similar to the stories of the good deeds of Yu Shun (虞舜) who faced several near-death situations due to his ruthless father and jealous stepbrother. Yu Shun refers to Emperor Shun. Because of his filial piety, he was able to marry the two daughters of Emperor Yao. He edified the people and gained the confidence of Emperor Yao. However, Shun’s father tried to punish and even kill him for the smallest mistakes Shun made. For instance, he told Shun to repair the storage and then set it on fire. He also told him Shun to dig a well and then tried to bury him alive in the well. Shun’s stepbrother also tried to kill Shun and take his two wives for himself. Yet every time Shun simply cried to the heavens and performed his duties as a son and brother. Due to this similarity between Emperor Shun and Yu Yeon in Yuhyogong seonhaengnok, Emperor Shun is often mentioned when discussing Yu Yeon. Yuhyogong seonhaengnok is also considered a work that provides a variety of interpretations of filial piety, brotherly love, and clan rules. Through a male-centric narrative that eliminates all conflicts that occur between women in the family, the author focuses on the issue of filial piety and brotherly love. As a result, some described the general significance of this work as an expression of the Korean gentry’s efforts to reinforce the concept of filial piety or as a process of establishing the paternal rights through conflicts that occur in family succession. Also, the concepts of brotherly love and filial piety create problems within the family but help restore and maintain the family’s reputation and prosperity. The resolution of the conflicts based on filial piety and brotherly love in Yuhyogong seonhaengnok provided a foundation for the Yu Family in Yussisamdaerok. In addition, Yuhyogong seonhaengnok is significant as a novel written in hangeul relatively earlier in the Joseon Dynasty.  Text  There are over 10 handwritten editions of Yuhyogong seonhaengnok, including the ones housed at the National Library of Korea, Harvard University, Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies at the Seoul National University, and other privately owned editions. There is not a lot of difference in the plot between the different editions. The 12 chapter and 12 volume edition housed at Kyujanggak Institute is one of the representative editions, and every volume consists of about 80 pages, 10 lines per page, and 17 to 20 characters per line. Yuhyogong seonhaengnok is considered a prequel to Yussisamdaerok.

History   Relationship with pansori  Pansori became popular in late Joseon Dynasty and people began to enjoy many of its narratives in a book form. Pansori is an art of musical storytelling performed by a singer (changja) and a drummer (gosu). It consists of songs (chang), narration (aniri), and physical gestures (neoreumsae). Pansori-based fiction refers to stories told through pansori that are written down in the book form. It is experienced differently than pansori—while pansori is heard and watched in a performance hall, pansori-based fiction is read at home. The titles of pansori-based fiction ended with \\"ga (歌)\\", \\"taryeong (打令)\\" (both meaning \\"song\\") or \\"jeon (傳)\\" (meaning \\"story\\" or \\"tale\\"). As it was created in relation to pansori, pansori-based fiction has the features and aesthetics of pansori. The common view is that pansori-based fiction evolved from folk narratives (seolhwa) to pansori to novels. However, some believe that this may not be so for all pansori-based novels. In particular, there is an opinion that the pansori-based novel Hwayongdo (華容道) existed before the pansori Jeokbyeok-ga (赤壁歌Song of Red Cliffs) as Jeokbyeok-ga borrows from sections of the Chinese novel Samgukjiyeonui (三國志演義 Romance of the Three Kingdoms). However, it is difficult to say that Jeokbyeok-ga tells the same story as Samgukjiyeonui, and therefore it is impossible to confirm that the novel came before the pansori. Considering that pansori and pansori-based fiction coexisted in the same period, it may be more reasonable to say that they mutually influenced each other.  Scope  In his poem \\"Gwanuhui\\" (觀優戲 Viewing Folk Entertainers’ Performances), Song Man-jae (宋晩載, 1788-1851) wrote about 12 works of pansori. These include Chunhyang-ga (春香歌 Song of Chunhyang), Sim Cheong-ga (沈淸歌 Song of Sim Cheong), Sugung-ga (水宮歌 Song of the Underwater Palace), Heungbo-ga (興甫歌 Song of Heungbo), Jeokbyeok-ga (赤壁歌 Song of Red Cliffs), Byeongangsoe-taryeong (Song of Byeongangsoe), Ong Gojip-taryeong (壅固執打令 Song of Ong Gojip), Bae Bijang-taryeong (裵裨將打令 Song of Bijang Bae), Gangneung Maehwa-taryeong (江陵梅花打令 Song of Maehwa in Gangneung), Jangkki- taryeong (Song of a Cock Pheasant), Musugi-taryeong (Song of Musuk), and Gajja sinseon-taryeong (Song of a Fake Taoist Hermit). Shin Jae-hyo (申在孝, 1812-1884) also left a record of pansori stories, which includes Chunhyang-ga, Sim Cheong-ga, Sugung-ga, Jeokbyeok-ga, and Byeongangsoe-ga. In his book Joseon changgeuksa (History of Changgeuk in Joseon Dynasty), Chong No-sik (鄭魯湜, 1891-1965) included Jangkki-taryeong, Byeongangsoe-taryeong, Musugi-taryeong, Bae Bijang-taryeong, Sim Cheong-jeon, Heungbo-jeon (Tale of Heungbo, or Bak- taryeong, Song of Gourd), Tobyeol-ga (兎鼈歌 Song of Hare and Tortoise), Chunhyang-jeon (Tale of Chunhyang), Jeokbyeok-ga (or Hwayongdo), Gangneung Maehwa-jeon (Tale of Maehwa in Gangneung), Ong Gojip, as well as Sugyeong nangja-jeon (淑英娘子傳 Story of Maiden Sugyeong). The stories of pansori listed in the abovementioned records that were written in the book form are now referred to as pansori-based fiction. Among the 12 works of pansori, only five remain intact with songs—Sim Cheong-ga, Chunhyang-ga, Jeokbyeok-ga, Heungbo-ga, and Sugung-ga. These are called jeongseungoga (傳承五歌five passed down songs). For the other seven, only the narratives have been passed down to today and not the songs. These include Byeongangsoe-taryeong, Bae Bijang-jeon, Ong Gojip- jeon, Jangkki-jeon, Musugi-taryeong (or Geusa, 戒友詞 Avoid Foolish People), Gangneung Maehwa-taryeong (or Golsaengwon-jeon, 骨生員傳 Tale of Golsaengwon). These are known as \\"lost pansori\\" or pansori whose songs have been lost. However, pansori-based fiction includes novels based on pansori regardless of whether they are still performed as pansori or not. Additionally, some view Yi Chunpung-jeon (李春風傳Tale of Yi Chunpung) as a pansori-based fiction in a broad sense even though it is not based on a pansori due to the characteristics of pansori and similar plot as Bae Bijang-jeon. It is estimated that the songs of the seven non-intact pansori were lost in the late 19th century. Although pansori began as a folk performance for the people, it gradually expanded its influence and was eventually embraced by the Korean elite as well. However, some were revised or changed to include aspects that went against general public sentiments, and the songs of the seven pansori seem to have been lost in this process.  Plots and themes  Just as pansori was created as a form of folk entertainment that reflects public sentiments, pansori-based fiction also tells stories with popular foundations and emotions. The general view is that pansori-based fiction reveals popular values through a realistic and secular plot. Some also argue that while the stories tout ethical norms of the time, people’s spirit of resistance and criticism of the reality are projected in them and therefore the stories should be analyzed differently depending on the themes that appear on the surface and within the stories. Chunhyang-jeon is a love story between Chunhyang, a daughter of a gisaeng (female entertainer) and Master Yi, the son of a yangban. The two meet in Namwon and fall in love but are separated when Yi leaves for Seoul. Byeon Hakdo, who takes up a government post in Namwon, tries to force Chunhyang to serve him, but Chunhyang endures terrible torture and remains faithful to Yi. Eventually, Yi returns to Namwon as a secret emissary to the king to punish Byeon and reunite with Chunhyang. If we focus on Chunhyang’s loyalty to Yi, the theme of this story is a woman’s virtue. However, a focus on Chunhyang’s resistance against Byeon Hakdo’s unreasonable request would make a commoner’s resistance against government power the theme of this story. There is an opinion that Chunhyang’s resistance against Byeon Hakdo should be read as a story of human liberation. Also, other versions of Chunhyang-jeon that emphasizes Chunhyang’s virtue have been titled Yeolnyeo Chunhyang sujeol-ga (烈女春香守節歌 Song of Virtuous Woman Chunhyang’s Loyalty to Her Husband). Sim Cheong-jeon is a story about a girl named Sim Cheong who throws herself into the sea of Indangsu as a sacrifice to make his blind father see again. She comes to life and her father regains his eyesight. Since Sim Cheong sacrifices her life for her father, this story emphasizes the ethical norm of \\"filial piety\\" on the surface, but some claim that it shows people’s awareness of realistic issues through the image of the patriarch Sim. Ttokki-jeon is a story of a tortoise going ashore to get a hare’s liver in order to treat the Dragon King’s illness. It is sometimes referred to as Byeoljubu-jeon (鼈主簿傳 Tale of Tortoise). On the surface, this story seems to emphasize the tortoise’s loyalty to the Dragon King, but it visualizes the tyranny of the corrupt ruling class, symbolized by the Dragon King, trying to exploit the people, represented by the hare. Some also believe that the trickster image of the hare represents the vivacity and wit of the people. Heungbu-jeon tells the story of conflict and reconciliation of two brothers Nolbu and Heungbu. On the outset, this story seems to be about the conflict and fraternity of the two brothers, but another interpretation of the story sees Nolbu and Heungbu as representations of the corrupt yangban and the emerging rich farmers, respectively, and considers the conflict between the two brothers as the conflict arising from the social differentiation of two classes in late Joseon Dynasty. Hwayongdo borrows from \\"Jeokbyeokdaejeon\\" (赤壁大戰 Battle of Red Cliffs) in Samgukjiyeonui. It begins with Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei making an oath in the Peach Garden and seeking out Zhuge Liang three times to have him as an advisor and ends with Zhuge Liang defeating Cao Cao’s army and Gwan Yu capturing and freeing Cao Cao. The novel is titled Hwayongdo because Cao Cao was said to have escaped on a road called Hwayongdo. Byeongangsoe-ga paints the life of Byeongangsoe and Ongnyeo as wanderers. On the surface it is a tragedy as it ends with Byeongangsoe and Ongnyeo in despair, unable to settle down, but there are comical scenes and unconventional elements in this story. In particular, \\"Gimul-taryeong\\" (奇物打令 Song of Strange Objects), which describes male and female genitals has received spotlight for various metaphors and expressions. Jangkki-jeon is about a conflict between jangkki (cock pheasant) and kkaturi (female pheasant). When jjangkki tries to eat a bean on the ground, kkaturi stops him, telling him about a dream she had the night before. But jangkki does not heed her advice and dies. In this story, jangkki symbolizes a stubborn, prejudiced, and violent patriarch. Bae Bijang- jeon is a story about Bijang Bae who is wary of feminine wiles being fooled and shamed by gisaeng Aerang, who seduces him under the order of the governor of Jeju. Golsaengwon-jeon (or Gangneung Maehwa-taryeong) tells the story of Golsaengwon who becomes infatuated with the beautiful gisaeng Maehwa and is humiliated. Ong Gojip-jeon is about an ascetic who uses magic to create a fake Ong Gojip and teach the miserly and cold-hearted Ong Gojip a lesson by having the real Ong Gojip argue with his fake self about who the real Ong Gojip is. Musugi-taryeong is a story about a playboy named Musuk who becomes a completely new person thanks to gisaeng Uiyang. Gajja sinseon-taryeong is known as a story about a man who behaves crudely, believing that he has become a Taoist hermit, but is eventually humiliated. The songs and the narrative of this pansori have been lost, and it is difficult to know the exact plot of this story. As described above, pansori-based fiction uses humor, satire, and jokes to express criticism of the reality with unique aesthetics.  Features and Significance  Shin Jae-ho played an important role in relation to pansori-based fiction. When pansori became popular, he began to train and sponsor gwangdae (performers) and other talents. His most important achievement is that he organized and polished the narratives of pansori, including Chunhyang-ga, Sim Cheong-ga, Bak-taryeong, Tobyeol-ga (Song of Hare and Tortoise), Jeokbyeok-ga, and Byeongangsoe-ga, which are classified as \\"Shin Jae-ho editions.\\" The Shin Jae-ho editions have contributed to the evolution of pansori into pansori-based novels to a certain extent. Among pansori-based novels, Chunhyang-jeon, Sim Cheong-jeon, and Heungbu-jeon were rewritten as sinsoseol (new fiction) titled Okjunghwa (옥중화 Flower in Prison), Gangsangnyeon (강상련 Lotus in the River), and Yeonui gak (연의 각 Leg of a Swallow), respectively. Many of pansori-based novels are still recreated into modern poems and prose and adapted into TV shows, films, changgeuk, and musicals.

At OSU, she leads the eponymous Tanguay Lab, where she applies systems toxicology principles using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) to discover the chemicals in the environment that can interact with expressed genomes to produce diseases and other dysfunctions. Her central hypothesis is that intrinsic chemical structures dictate biological activity. The shape of chemicals permit interactions with distinct biological targets to alter normal biological activity. She uses chemical structural information; coupled with the biological responses they produce in zebrafish, as anchors to screen for potentially hazardous chemicals and to discover new biology.  Education  Tanguay was born in 1966 in Menominee, Michigan. After finishing the 11th grade, Tanguay moved, to Fontana, California where she graduated from Fontana High School. Tanguay received a Bachelor of Arts in Biology in 1988 from California State University, San Bernardino. She received technical research training in the Department of Molecular Biology at the City of Hope National Medical Center and the Beckman Research Institute in Duarte, California in the laboratory of Arthur Riggs. She then joined University of California, where she received a Ph.D in Biochemistry in 1995 under the guidance of Daniel R Gallie. She completed her Postdoctoral training with Richard E. Peterson at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Career  In 1999, Tanguay joined University of Colorado as an Assistant Professor of Molecular Toxicology. She left the University of Colorado in 2003 to join Oregon State University as an Associate Professor of Molecular Toxicology and to direct the Sinnhuber Aquatic Research Laboratory, becoming Full Professor in 2010.

The shape of chemicals permit interactions with distinct biological targets to alter normal biological activity. She uses chemical structural information; coupled with the biological responses they produce in zebrafish, as anchors to screen for potentially hazardous chemicals and to discover new biology. Tanguay's lab has worked to increase the use of zebrafish for green chemistry and green nano. Her lab has also develops instrument, protocol and software to incorporate the use of zebrafish into the high throughput environment. Tanguay's lab has also conducted research on tissue regeneration. Their research is focused on discovering molecular pathways that prevent or promote tissue regeneration in vertebrates.  Personal life  Born as Robert Tanguay, she felt that she could connect more with females and that there was something amiss with her identity since childhood. She struggled to understand what was wrong. In her teen years, she understood that she was a trans, but kept this fact hidden growing increasingly lonely. After she was married and had a daughter, she began meeting other trans people, which gave her the courage to share her experiences with other people. She began living as a female privately, while keeping the male persona in her professional life. In 2019, she publicly transitioned, changing her name to Robyn.

It is situated at the northeast corner of Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park, north of Pemberton, west of Lillooet, north of Tolkien Peak, and immediately south of Mount Aragorn, which is its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. History The first ascent of the mountain was made on May 8, 1972, by Peter Jordan, Fred Thiessen, and Eric White.UBC Varsity Outdoor Club Journal, vol 15, 1972, pp 52-55 This climbing party also made the first ascents of nearby Mount Aragorn and Mount Shadowfax. The names for Mounts Aragorn, Gandalf, and Shadowfax were taken from fictional characters in the novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, which were read while waiting out stormy weather during the 1972 outing. However, Mt. Gandalf became incorrectly identified on maps as Shadowfax, and vice versa, as originally proposed in 1978 by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada. The mountains' names were corrected as recommended in March 2006 by Scott Nelson and endorsed by the BC Mountaineering Club. The correction was officially adopted December 4, 2006, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Gandalf is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Gandalf.

Early life  Elwyn Henry Flint was born on 12 May 1910 to Edmund Henry Flint and his wife Mabel. He was a cousin of the Rev. A.C. Flint. He attended Windsor State School and Brisbane State High School and won an open scholarship at the age of 16 to attend the University of Queensland in 1928. He graduated in 1930 with a B.A., first class honours degree in modern languages and literature and a government gold medal for outstanding merit.  Career  He took up work as a Reader at the University of Queensland until this contract expired in 1932. He enrolled in a M.A. with a thesis entitled, Modern methods of learning and teaching foreign languages, with special reference to Australian conditions. From 1936 to 1938 he attended St Francis' Theological College and was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He served as curate of St Andrews Church in Lutwyche, was vicar of Monto, and became an army chaplain between 1943 and 1945. He also became an army intelligence officer during this period, learning Japanese to help interrogate Japanese prisoners of war. Following his discharge from the army, he eventually returned to lecturing at the University of Queensland in 1949 and completed his M.A. He commenced research towards a PhD with a thesis entitled \\"The living theatre in England from 1914–1954\\", but did not complete these studies. He studied Chinese drama and Japanese Noh plays during this research period. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1958. He produced plays for student dramatic societies and was an active secretary of the Staff Tennis Club. Flint retired in 1975.  Catalogue of Aboriginal languages and dialects of English  Flint was interested in language variation. In 1956 he undertook work to study dialects of English spoken on Norfolk Island and how these dialects were influenced by non-resident 'migrant' English. These recordings were made of natural conversation. During the 1960s, Flint took extensive audio recordings of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities and the English spoken in these communities for the Australian Research Council funded Queensland Speech Survey. 29 communities including Yarrabah, Cherbourg, Woorabinda, Palm Island, Doomadgee, Bloomfield River, Aurukun, Weipa were canvassed with the assistance of three students. Coral Readdy for Stradbroke Island and Cherbourg, Tom Dutton for Palm Island and Diane Alexander for Yarrabah and Woorabinda summarised findings in their respective theses. Flint published analyses of the phonological and grammatical features of Aboriginal English. Flint also collected Aboriginal language material from Yuulngu (North East Arhnemland). He was also interested in Asian, European, Pacific and Indonesian languages. Some of this material is kept in the Department of English at the University of Queensland.  Memberships  Australian Linguistic Society  Legacy  Flint died on 10 December 1983. 57 boxes of Flint's papers and his recordings of language variation in Indigenous communities are available through the University of Queensland Fryer Library.

He was one of the few members of the Iwakura Mission who stayed in the United States after graduating from a college there. He worked in mines in the western United States and Pennsylvania.  Early life and education  Matsudaira was born on September 19, 1851 Edo Castle, which is now part of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. His father was , and his older brother was Matsudaira Tadanari. He attended a Christian church in Tsukiji. In 1872, Matsudaira went to New York with Tadanari as part of the Iwakura Mission. They enrolled in Rutgers University in New Jersey. Matsudaira transferred to Harvard and graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1877. Tadakata ordered both of his sons to return home in 1879, but only Tadanari returned. Matsudaira was one of the only members of the Iwakura Mission to remain in the United States.  Career  After graduation Matsudaira worked for the Manhattan Elevated Railway. While working there, he invented the trigonometer, a surveying tool. He then moved to Wyoming and worked as an engineer at the Union Pacific Railroad. He later worked in mines in Idaho and Montana. He became the city engineer of Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1884. While living in Pennsylvania he married and had two children with Cary Sampson, the daughter of Archibald Sampson, a general in the United States Army. One of his children was Kinjiro Matsudaira. Matsudaira contracted tuberculosis, and the family moved to Denver, Colorado in hopes that the dry climate would improve his health. Before he died, he made some maps of the state. He died on January 24, 1888. In 1952 several Japanese Colorodans erected a memorial in Riverside Cemetery in his name. However, even though the memorial stone says that he was the first Japanese person to live in Colorado, the federal census suggests that other Japanese people lived in Colorado before 1890.

Legal and business career In 1846, illness caused Wales to seek a warmer climate. He resided with relatives near Holly Springs, Mississippi for three years, during which he worked as a tutor for a plantation-owning family. He returned to Burlington in 1849, and resumed practicing law. Among the prospective lawyers who learned under Wales's tutelage was Russell S. Taft, who later became a partner in Wales's law firm. In the years immediately prior to the American Civil War, Wales was active in a Burlington militia company, the Howard Guards. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Farmers and Merchants Bank, which was later reorganized as the Merchants Bank. He also served as treasurer of the Mary Fletcher Hospital, and was a member of the board of trustees for the University of Vermont. He also served as a volunteer fire fighter as a member of Burlington's Boxer Company. Political career Chittenden County Originally a Whig, and later a Republican, Wales was long active in Vermont politics and government. In 1854, Wales was elected State's Attorney of Chittenden County, and he served until 1857. In 1862, he was elected the county's probate court judge, and he served until 1898. Burlington In 1854, he was elected to Burlington's board of selectmen. After Burlington was incorporated as a city, he served as its second mayor from 1866 to 1868. He served on the board of aldermen from 1869 to 1871, and performed the mayor's duties after the resignation of Daniel Chipman Linsley. He again served as an alderman from 1874 to 1875. From 1883 to 1884, Wales was Burlington's city attorney. Among the other offices in which Wales served the city were justice of the peace and street commissioner. State legislature In 1868 and 1869, Wales was elected to represent Burlington in the Vermont House of Representatives. He was elected to the Vermont House again in 1876 and served until 1878. Death and burial On July 5, 1902 Wales died at his home in Burlington. The funeral took place in Burlington at the Congregational Church on College Street. He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. Family In 1846, Wales married Elizabeth C. Mason (1822-1886). In 1888, he married Helen M. Mason (d. 1895) a niece of his first wife. With his first wife, Wales was the father of two sons, George W. Wales (1855-1890), and Henry H. Wales (1858-1860). In April 1868, George Wales was accidentally shot in the lung by the instructor who was teaching him business writing at a Burlington commercial college. He made a full recovery, and Torrey Wales and he later practiced law together as Wales & Wales. George Wales went on to serve as private secretary for U.S. Senators Justin Smith Morrill and Henry L. Dawes, and Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant) to Governor John L. Barstow.

The term Flanders in the 1500s referred to the entire Habsburg Netherlands within the Burgundian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire and inclusive of modern-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Its political capital was Brussels, while the financial-economic centre was Antwerp. Other major artistic and cultural centres of the period included Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and Leuven. It is also grouped with the Dutch Golden Age, a more common term used primarily in reference to the Dutch Republic in the 1600s, within a \\"Flemish and Dutch golden age\\" covering the period from the late 15th to the 17th century. History Portrait of Charles of Ghent by Bernard van Orley, 1519. The insignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece are prominently displayed. On 24 February 1500, Charles of Ghent was born to Philip the Handsome (son of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian I of Austria) and Joanna the Mad (daughter of Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon). Charles eventually inherited the four crowns of Burgundy (1506), Castile (1516), Aragon (1516), and Austria (1519). The inheritances of Burgundy and Austria made him respectively Lord of the Netherlands and Archduke of Austria, giving to one person an unprecedented amount of direct possessions within the Holy Roman Empire. The inheritances of Castile and Aragon formed a Spanish empire that stretched from the Castilian West Indies to the Aragonese Two Sicilies. The election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 crowned Charles' dynastic fortunes, giving him sovereignty in Germany and North Italy as a formal successor of Charlemagne. Charles was also heir of the imperial idea of the House of Austria: A.E.I.O.U (\\"Austria Est Imperare Orbi Universo\\", it is Austria's destiny to rule the world). In an age of high renaissance and global explorations, when reformed churches and national monarchies were emerging, Charles embraced the medieval dream of building a universal monarchy in the Old World of Christendom. Given that Charles was a Fleming and that Burgundian chivalric culture formed the basis of his beliefs, Brussels would ascend from capital of the Habsburg Netherlands to main seat of his itinerant court. Having added Spanish Mexico, German Venezuela, Spanish Peru, the Duchy of Milan, and the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia to his composite monarchy, he styled himself as the ruler of an empire on which the sun never sets. Charles V also expanded the Netherlands' territory. He first added Tournai and the Tournaisis, under French influence until 1521. In 1524, Friesland was conquered and renamed Lordship of Frisia. During the Guelders Wars Charles annexed the Lordship of Utrecht and Lordship of Overijssel, the Lordship of Groningen and County of Drenthe. In 1543, Charles V finally obtained the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen. With the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, all Low Countries' territories were merged into the Seventeen Provinces. Allegory on Emperor Charles V's abdication in Brussels by Frans Francken the Younger. Charles divided his empire between Philip II of Spain and Emperor Ferdinand I. Philip II of Spain received the Low Countries and made them a province of the Spanish Empire. However, the abdications of Brussels formalized by Charles V between 1554 and 1556 divided the House of Habsburg and its possessions between a Spanish branch led by Philip II of Spain and a German-Austrian branch led by Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles abdicated in favor of his son Philip the Two Sicilies and the Duchy of Milan in July 1554, the Habsburg Netherlands in October 1555, and the kingdoms of Spain and the Americas in January 1556. Philip was secretly made Duke of Milan already in 1540. He will also inherit Portugal in 1580. In August 1556, Charles abdicated the throne of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in favor of his younger brother Ferdinand, elected as his designated successor in 1531. The Imperial succession also marked the legal transfer of the Austrian hereditary lands of the Empire to Ferdinand, who ruled them in the name of the Emperor since 1521. At his last public speech in front of the States General, Charles famously said \\"my life has been one long journey\\". His son Philip will return in Spain in 1559 and never visit the Low Countries again, ruling these territories as King of Spain rather than Duke of Burgundy. Flanders and Belgium were part of the Spanish Netherlands from 1556, and entered a period of decline in favor of the Dutch Republic which was soon to break off from the Spanish empire. Symbolic of this is the Sack of Antwerp by Spanish forces in 1576, which forced many merchants to flee to Amsterdam and Holland. The Dutch Golden Age lasted for most of the 17th century. Economy The size of Charles' empire made the port city of Antwerp \\"the centre of the entire international economy\\"(Braudel 1985 p. 143.) Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the fact that it became the financial centre where Spanish precious metals coming from the Americas were exchanged for banking credit of rich German families (namely the Fugger and the Welser). During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps. Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Sack of Antwerp in 1576, in which about 7,000 people died. By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \\"To the merchants of all nations.\\" Peter Gay and R.K. Webb, Modern Europe to 1815 (1973), p. 210. The city of Antwerp was a leader in the pepper market, the market of precious metals coming from Mexico and Peru, and the textile industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade.Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). \\"Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective\\". PUQ. p.308. The boom-and- bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers. In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically. The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth. Numerous financial bankruptcies began around 1557, until Amsterdam eventually replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.Gay and Webb, Modern Europe to 1815 (1973), pp. 210–11. Aside from commerce, the Flanders were historically also an important manufacturing region. The beginning of the century the old cloth industries of Flanders had been seriously threatened by English competition; However, Charles V implemented reforms to put the industries of the Netherlands under protection. The cloth industry was strengthened by the introduction of factory methods, and the linen industry was fully developed. Such economic policy was successful. He created new and efficient agencies that fostered the social and industrial life of the people. Agriculture was also promoted together with commercial legislation. Art The Fall of Icarus, now considered a copy of Pieter Bruegel the Elder Flemish artists, who span from the Antwerp Mannerists and Hieronymus Bosch at the start of the 16th century to the late Northern Mannerists such as Hendrik Goltzius and Joachim Wtewael at the end, drew on both the recent innovations of Italian painting and the local traditions of the Early Netherlandish artists. Many artists worked for European courts, including Bosch, whose fantastic painted images left a long legacy. Jan Mabuse, Maarten van Heemskerck and Frans Floris were all instrumental in adopting Italian models and incorporating them into their own artistic language. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, with Bosch the only artist from the period to remain widely familiar, may seem atypical, but in fact his many innovations drew on the fertile artistic scene in Antwerp. Dutch and Flemish painters were also instrumental in establishing new subjects such as landscape painting and genre painting. Joachim Patinir, for example, played an important role in developing landscape painting, inventing the compositional type of the world landscape, which was perfected by Pieter Bruegel the Elder who, followed by Pieter Aertsen, also helped popularise genre painting. From the mid-century Pieter Aertsen, later followed by his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer, established a type of \\"monumental still life\\" featuring large spreads of food with genre figures, and in the background small religious of moral scenes. Like the world landscapes, these represented a typically \\"Mannerist inversion\\" of the normal decorum of the hierarchy of genres, giving the \\"lower\\" subject matter more space than the \\"higher\\".Snyder, 409-412, 432-445 Anthonis Mor was the leading portraitist of the mid-century, in demand in courts all over Europe for his reliable portraits in a style that combined Netherlandish precision with the lessons of Titian and other Italian painters. Hell, the right panel from the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch Italian Renaissance influences begin to show on Early Netherlandish painting around 1500, but in many ways the older style was remarkably persistent. Antwerp Mannerism is a term for painters showing some Italian influence, but mainly continuing the style and subjects of the older masters. Hieronymus Bosch is a highly individual artist, whose work is strange and full of seemingly irrational imagery, making it difficult to interpret. Most of all it seems surprisingly modern, introducing a world of dreams that seems more related to Gothic art than the Italian Renaissance, although some Venetian prints of the same period show a comparable degree of fantasy. The Romanists were the next phase of influence, adopting Italian styles in a far more thorough way. After 1550 the Flemish and Dutch painters begin to show more interest in nature and beauty \\"in itself\\", leading to a style that incorporates Renaissance elements, but remains far from the elegant lightness of Italian Renaissance art, and directly leads to the themes of the great Flemish and Dutch Baroque painters: landscapes, still lifes and genre painting - scenes from everyday life. This evolution is seen in the works of Joachim Patinir and Pieter Aertsen, but the true genius among these painters was Pieter Brueghel the Elder, well known for his depictions of nature and everyday life, showing a preference for the natural condition of man, choosing to depict the peasant instead of the prince. The Fall of Icarus (now in fact considered a copy of a Brueghel work), although highly atypical in many ways, combines several elements of Northern Renaissance painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.

Playing career As a child, Senn was encouraged to play hockey after watching his brother train with Visp. He alternated between forward, defence, and goalie, before eventually settling for goaltender. While growing up in Switzerland, he had limited exposure to the National Hockey League but as he grew older, he began to idolize NHL goaltenders David Aebischer and Martin Gerber. At the age of 16, Senn left the Visp U17 for Davos U17 to combine school and sport. He finished Gymnasium with a high school diploma while continuing to play hockey. Senn helped lead HC Davos to the semi-finals of the 2016 Spengler Cup with a 3–1 win over the Avtomobilist Ekaterinburg. After the 2016–17 season, Davos lost their starting goaltender Leonardo Genoni to SC Bern, which promoted Senn to their starter the following season. He worked alongside his backup Joren van Pottelberghe to help lead HC Davos to the semi- finals, before eventually losing 5–3. Senn played a career high 34 games during the regular season and posted a .910 save percentage. Despite the loss in the semi-finals, Senn's performance impressed the New Jersey Devils who drafted him 129th overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. In August 2017, he was the recipient of the NLA's Youngster of the Year Award. On 17 April 2019, Senn signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the New Jersey Devils. Later that year, he attended the Devils' development camp at the Prudential Center. After attending the Devils' training camp, he was reassigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate the Binghamton Devils. Senn eventually made his AHL debut with the Binghamton Devils on 12 October in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Belleville Senators. After posting a .89 save percentage, he was reassigned to their ECHL affiliate the Adirondack Thunder on 23 November, but was recalled before he could play a game. On 20 December, Senn made his NHL debut when he replaced Mackenzie Blackwood in the third period. He made two saves and allowed one goal as the Devils lost 5–2 against the Washington Capitals. In the next game, on 21 December, Senn made his first NHL start, making 35 saves and allowing three goals in a 5–1 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. International play During the 2017–18 season, Senn was selected as the third goaltender for Team Switzerland during the 2018 IIHF World Championship, behind Genoni and Reto Berra. He played in four exhibition games and recorded a 2.55 goals against average and .914 save percentage. As a member of Team Switzerland, he earned a silver medal after a loss in the gold medal game to Sweden.

The law was adopted by the National People's Congress on March 15, 2019 and came into effect on January 1, 2020. It replaces the Law of the People's Republic of China on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprises and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures.  History  Soon after China's reform and opening up, the country adopted its first law on equity joint ventures in 1979, and the laws on wholly foreign-owned enterprises and cooperative joint ventures were enacted in the 1980s. Over the past decades, they have provided legal safeguards for foreign firms and promoted foreign investment and cooperation in China. As China becomes one of the world's top recipients of FDI, with some 960,000 foreign-invested enterprises and over 2.1 trillion US dollars of accumulated FDI by the end of 2018, the legal framework for foreign investment needed to be updated in order for further reform and opening up. The unified Foreign Investment Law, replacing the three existing laws, was adopted at the Second Session of the 13th National People's Congress on March 15, 2019 and comes into effect on January 1, 2020.  Key Provisions  The Law's key provisions are as follows: • It defines \\"foreign investment\\" as the investment activity directly or indirectly conducted by a foreign natural person, enterprise or other organization, including establishing a foreign-funded enterprise in China; acquiring shares, equities, property shares or any other similar rights and interests of a local enterprise; making investment to initiate a new project independently or jointly with any other investor; and making investment in any other way stipulated by laws or regulations. • The government implements the management systems of pre- establishment national treatment and negative list for foreign investment. • The competent departments for commerce (Ministry of Commerce) and for investment (National Development and Reform Commission) are delegated major responsibility to promote, protect and manage foreign investment. • All national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with the law. The government establishes a service system for foreign investment, and provide foreign investors and foreign-funded enterprises with consultation and services in respect of laws and regulations, policies and measures, investment project information and other aspects. • The government is not to expropriate any investment made by foreign investors; Under special circumstances, the government may expropriate or requisition an investment made by foreign investors for public interests in accordance with the law. Such expropriation or requisition shall be made pursuant to statutory procedures and fair and reasonable compensation will be given in a timely manner. • A foreign investor may freely transfer inward and outward its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from asset disposal, royalties of intellectual property rights, lawfully obtained compensation or indemnity, income from liquidation and so on within the territory of China in CNY or a foreign currency. • The government protects the intellectual property rights and trade secrets of foreign investors and foreign-funded enterprises, and encourages technology cooperation on the basis of free will and business rules. • The government establishes a safety review system for any foreign investment affecting or having the possibility to affect national security.  Comments  Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said the Law shows China's will and determination to follow through with reform and opening up in a new historical context, and that \\"it is a full testament to China's determination and confidence in opening wider to the outside world and promoting foreign investment in the new era.\\" Vivian Jiang, vice chair of Deloitte China, said the Law sends the signal of \\"greater transparency\\", and will \\"boost Chinese market's appeal to foreign capital.\\" Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Law puts a \\"strong emphasis on preventing Chinese entities from forcing foreign companies to transfer valuable technology\\" in order to do business in China, while improving protection of trade secrets. Jake Parker, senior vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the Law still falls short of \\"specifying what kinds of trade secret disclosures will be prohibited, and clarifying which kinds of administrative departments the provisions on technology transfer may apply to.\\" It is also \\"vague on how communication channels between government agencies and foreign entities will be managed, and how feedback will be incorporated.\\"  See also  * Economy of China * Law of the People's Republic of China * Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China * Intellectual Property in China * Foreign Direct Investment  References  Category:Laws of China Category:Economy of China Category:Foreign direct investment Category:Chinese business law Category:Investment in China ","title":"Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China"},{"id":"62442195","text":"Price M.

The football team played top division league football from 1937 to 1948. During a period in the 1930s, Hardy was considered to be the best team from Bergen. They won the Bergen league championship (in Norwegian: Kretsserien) in 1933 and 1936. In 1935, they reached the semi-finals of the Norwegian Cup where they lost 3–0 against Fredrikstad at Brann Stadion in a game attended by 17,000 spectators. Two of Norway's bronze medal winning players from the 1936 Summer Olympics, Odd Frantzen and Magdalon Monsen, represented Hardy at the time. In addition, Birger Pedersen and Godfred Bysheim also represented Norway in the same year. Hardy played in the inaugural season of the national league top division; the 1937–38 Norgesserien, where they finished in third place in their district group. In the following 1938–39 season, Hardy won their District VI group and qualified for the championship play-offs. They reached the semi-finals where they were eliminated by Fredrikstad in a second replay after two draws. In 1947–48 the first post-war season, Hardy were among the 58 teams that relegated from the top division due to restructuring of the league system. Hardy originated from the Nygård neighbourhood, but due to lack of recruitment, the club decided to move to Mannsverk in the late 1960s. This led to a increase of youth players. Club activity decreased during the 1980s. In 1995, Hardy withdrew their team from the league system. However, Hardy has later returned with teams in local 7-player leagues and old boys leagues, but not in the national league system.

Biography He graduated from La Grande Magnolia; a Piarist school, and, at the age of seventeen, became a Novice in the order. He then enrolled in the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Florence, graduating in 1880 and being ordained as a priest the same year. After that, he taught in the public schools, but would spend most of his career at the Piarist College of Le Acacie. In 1904, he became Rector of the Colegio Il Canneto. He had written two novels as an adolescent. When he met and befriended Carlo Collodi; author of The Adventures of Pinocchio, he was inspired to write his own sequel, Pinocchio in the Moon. Although he is primarily remembered as an author of children's books and elementary school reading texts, he also wrote books on zoology, botany and religious subjects; notably a biography and appreciation of Saint John of the Cross. Many of his books' covers were designed by Carlo Chiostri, who had created illustrations for the original Pinocchio. Later, he founded the semi- monthly journal Il granello di pepe (The Peppercorn), in which he serialized several of his novels. From 1914 to 1924, he concentrated on books about animals. Natalia Ginzburg has praised his imagination and noted that the bad fates met by some of the animals paralleled human misfortunes. In a series of books with a character named \\"Ugo\\", he introduced scientific concepts for the elementary school level.

The name arose as a result of a friend's suggestion it be called the \\"Red Herring Press\\", but Fast agreed that \\"while that was colorful, it did not strike [him] as a fruitful aid to selling books\\". Blue Heron Press was a way for Fast to publish his book Spartacus, which at the time was blacklisted. Spartacus became the first book published by the new press. In 1953, Blue Heron Press published a reprint of W. E. B. Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk, which was the eighth book published by Blue Heron Press. The suggestion was made by Shirley Graham Du Bois as a 50th anniversary edition, as it had been previously published in 1903 by A. C. McClurg & Company.

He is the founder of Bashkir linguistics and of the modern Bashkir school of Ural–Altaic languages. He received awards for Excellence in Public Education of the RSFSR (1967) and an Honored Worker of Science of the BASSR (1961).  Biography  Jalil Keyekbaev was born in 1911 to a peasant family in the village of Karan-Yelga in the Ufa Governorate. His father, Giniyatulla, graduated from the madrasah (school) in the village of Utyakovo, where he was taught by the one of the best educators in the region, Khabibnazar Utyaki (The uncle of Zeki Velidi Togan, the founder of the Republic of Bashkortostan). Keyekbaev's mother was Garifa (daughter of Murzakai). He studied at Makarovskaya Secondary School in the village of Makarovo. From 1929 to 1932 he studied at the pedagogical college in Ufa. During these years, he began to print his poems under the pseudonym Zhalil Tabyn (using the name of his tribe). He graduated from the Faculty of Germanic Philology of the First Moscow State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages (1937), then worked as a German teacher for one year at Roshalsky secondary school in the Moscow Region. In 1938, he began working at the Ufa Institute of Foreign Languages. During World War II, he temporarily left for his native district due to the need to accommodate evacuated teachers in the city of Ufa. In 1942, he served as director of the Saitbabinskaya secondary school of the Gafuri District. He taught foreign languages in various secondary schools and higher educational institutions of the republic. Since 1943 to 1944, he was the chief editor of a Bashkir book publishing house. Since 1944 to 1953, he worked at the Ufa Aviation Institute (until 1946 and after 1948, he was head of the Department of Foreign Languages). In 1948, he defended his Ph.D. thesis on the topic \\"Orthoepy of the Bashkir literary language\\" at Moscow State University. He then worked at Temiryazev Bashkir Pedagogical Institute (now Bashkir State University), where he was employed as a senior lecturer and later dean of the faculty of foreign languages. His scientific views were largely shaped by his dissertation advisor, Turkologist and orientalist Nikolai Dmitriev. From 1951 to 1968 he headed the Department of Bashkir Linguistics at Temiryazev Bashkir Pedagogical Institute. From 1957 to 1961 he was Vice-Rector for Academic Affairs. In 1960, he defended his doctoral dissertation, \\"Phonetics of the Bashkir language (experience of descriptive and comparative historical research)\\". In 1961 he was awarded the title of professor, in 1967, he earned the title of Honored Scientist of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Cover of the book Wood Tales Keyekbayev came to literature in the 1930s. Along with writing his own poetry, he translated from German into Bashkir the works of Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Erich Weinert, Willi Bredel, Friedrich Wolf (Keyekbaev was his translator in Ufa in 1936), and the Brothers Grimm. During World War II he wrote cubiars, essays, and stories on patriotic themes. He is the author of a book for children in the Bashkir language Urman әkiәttәre (1954; in the Russian translation of \\"Wood Tales\\", 1956), and translated the tales of Jacob Grimm (1940; Nemes halyk әkiәttәre) and Hungarian folk tales (1963; Vengr halyk әkiәttәre; co- authored). He performed Bashkir folk songs and played the piano, mandolin, and quray.  Scientific work  Keyekbaev used a new approach to studying the phonetics, morphology, lexicology and lexis of the Bashkir language. He is the founder of modern Bashkir linguistics, and author of many textbooks. Keyekbaev for the first time in Turkology substantiated the phoneme as a unit that serves not only for the formation of words and morphemes, but also for distinguishing their meanings.О научных достижениях профессора Дж. Г. Киекбаева (к 105-летию со дня рождения) page 63 phonetic means morphological means. Aznabaev A.M.To the 105th anniversary of Jalil Kiekbaev. On the scientific achievements of the professor The ability of a phoneme to differentiate words is its social function. In 1966, he published a fundamental work, \\"Vocabulary and Phraseology of the Modern Bashkir Literary Language\\". The monograph pays particular attention to lexical borrowings from Russian, Arabic, Persian and other languages. In 1966, he published a textbook on the Bashkir language for students of the correspondence department of the philological faculty of Bashkir State University, which describes in detail the grammatical categories of the nominal parts of speech and verbs. Keyekbaev's monograph \\"Fundamentals of the Historical Grammar of the Ural- Altai Languages\\" (which received positive reviews from Nikolai Baskakov, Mirfatyh Zakiev and Boris Serebrennikov) was published posthumously in 1996; it bases a comparative examination of languages on the category of certainty and uncertainty.Илишев И.

In his monograph, Introduction to Ural-Altai Languages (1972), he was the first to show the genetic affinity of Uralic and Altaic. Keyekbaev made a significant contribution to the training of scientific and pedagogical staff. More than ten candidate's and doctoral theses were defended under his guidance.

It is situated north of Pemberton, west of Lillooet, and immediately north of Mount Gandalf. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. History The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1972 by Peter Jordan, Fred Thiessen, and Eric White.UBC Varsity Outdoor Club Journal, vol 15, 1972, pp 52-55 This climbing party also made the first ascents of nearby Mount Gandalf and Mount Shadowfax. The names Aragorn, Gandalf, and Shadowfax were taken from fictional characters in the novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, which were read while waiting out stormy weather during the 1972 outing. The mountain's name was proposed in 1978 by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada, and was officially adopted January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Mt. Aragorn seen from Mt. Gandalf Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Aragorn is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Aragorn.

As all Monogenea, species of Atriostella are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. This genus was proposed by Unnithan in 1971 who included in this genus two subgenera: the subgenus Atriostella with a single middorsal unarmed vaginal pore; and the subgenus Biplacunella with a ventral cuticular post-atrial body plaque and a much wider dorsal plaque behind the two unarmed vulvae. Members of the genus Atriostella are characterised by a generally symmetrical haptor, a genital atrium armed with erect long spines of and a muscular penis lobed or not and entirely unarmed.Unnithan, R.

The temple was dedicated to Ba'alat Gebal, the goddess of the city of Byblos, known later to the Greeks as Atargatis. Built in 2800 BCE, it was the largest and most important sanctuary in ancient Byblos, and is considered to be \\"one of the first monumental structures of the Syro-Palestinian region\\". Two centuries after the construction of the Temple of Baalat Gebal, the Temple of the Obelisks was built approximately 100m to the east. The length and continuity of its history as an active temple is \\"remarkable\\" and \\"supports its centrality in the life of the city\\". An important group of Byblos figurines were found in the temple;WorldWide: Lebanon, Biblical Archaeology Review 34:5, September/October 2008 these figurines have become the \\"poster child\\" of the Lebanese Tourism Ministry. Background  The temple, and its patroness, Ba‘alat Gebal, were venerated in the city for more than two millennia during the Canaanite and Phoenician eras. It was constructed when Byblos had close ties with Egypt, and a number of Egyptian references are found throughout the temple complex. The temple itself was expanded a number of times and remained in use until the Roman era. Modern identification and excavation The site of the temple is near the Crusaders' Byblos Castle, and was first excavated by French archaeologist Pierre Montet from 1921–24 and subsequently in the early part of Maurice Dunand's excavation of the city. Montet published two sketches of his excavations, and Dunand published a few plans for the wider sector of excavations in his 1939 volume. Almost all of the artifacts found in the excavation of the temple are displayed at the National Museum of Beirut. The temple now sits east of the Roman theater. The theater, built around AD 218, was reconstructed and moved to allow excavation of the temple site.

The type species is Albadraco tharmisensis. Discovery and naming At the site of Oarda de Jos, near Alba Iulia in Alba County, two jaw pieces were found of a large pterosaur. The discovery was reported and illustrated in a dissertation by Cǎtǎlin Jipa- Murzea in 2012.Jipa-Murzea, C., 2012, Upper Cretaceous continental vertebrate assemblages from Metaliferi sedimentary area: systematics, paleoecology and paleobiogeography, PhD Thesis Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, 228 pp In 2019, the type species Albadraco tharmisensis was named and described by Alexandru Adrian Solomon, Vlad Aurel Codrea, Márton Venczel and Gerald Grellet-Tinner. The generic name combines a reference to Alba with the Latin draco, \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to a provenance near Tharmis, the ancient Dacian name of Alba Iulia. The holotype, PSMUBB V651a, b, was found in a layer of the Șard Formation dating from the latest Maastrichtian, sixty-six million years old. It consists of two fused premaxillae of the snout (PSMUBB V651a) and a piece of the symphysis of the lower jaws (PSMUBB V651b). Both parts were assumed to have belonged to a single individual, perhaps a subadult animal. It is the first example from the Cretaceous of Europe of a pterosaur exemplar preserving both upper jaw and lower jaw elements. A second specimen, PSMUBB V652, a fourth neck vertebra from the same site, was referred to the species. It too is from a subadult animal and the describing authors considered it possible that it represented the same individual as the holotype. Description The wingspan of the holotype was estimated at five to six metres, by extrapolation from the jaw pieces. The adult size was estimated at a span of six to seven metres. Albadraco shared its habitat with Hatzegopteryx and the possibility was considered that its holotype was only a juvenile exemplar of that giant pterosaur. This was deemed improbable however, because the holotype bone structure resembled that of subadult animals, not of fast growing young individuals. The describing authors indicated five distinguishing traits. They were autapomorphies, unique derived characters, in which Albadraco differs from all other known Azhdarchidae. The cutting edges and sides of the beak show a high foramina density. The premaxilla has split- like foramina on the lower and side surfaces but also two rows of foramina on the side. The snout has a triangular cross-section but its top edge is more rounded than with other azhdarchids. The symphysis of the lower jaws has a U-shaped cross-section in front but a V-shaped one at the rear. The fourth neck vertebra has an Elongation Ratio, horizontal length divided by transverse width, that more approaches the ER of the third neck vertebra of other azhdarchids in being shorter than usual. Phylogeny In 2019, Albadraco was placed in the Azhdarchidae, based on the comparative method.

The following table compares the speeds of commercially relevant 3D printing technologies. {  + !Technology !Normal speed !Maximum speed (claimed) - DLP/SLA 20-36 mm/hr. 720 mm/hr - FDM 50-150 mm/hr 500 mm/hr - SLS 48 mm/hr 60 mm/hr - Material Jetting 2800 cm³/hr to 4000 cm3/hr 4500 cm3/hr } 3D printing speed refers to only the build stage, a subcomponent of the entire 3D printing process. However, the entire process spans from pre-processing to post-processing stages. The time required for printing a completed part from a data file (.stl or .obj) is calculated as the sum of time for the following stages: #The pre-processing stage, which spans the preparation process of both part and printer. This is required before the actual printing starts. It is calculated as the sum of the time required for the following processes: #* Positioning and orienting of the part to be printed #* Entering the parameters (e.g. layer thickness, material type) within the printer's software #* Generation of the support structure #*Generation of slices (slicing) #* Generation of the tool path plan by the software #* Warming up and loading of support and build materials #* The setting of the x-y and z axes #* Diagnostics, cleaning or additional testing #The build stage, which is the actual print time after the prepared data are transferred to the printer for manufacturing. It can be considered as the sum of the following periods: #*Manufacturing time, when the part and support materials are being manufactured #*Idle time, non-productive time such as z-axis movement, cooling time, leveling, non-manufacturing movement of printhead #The post-processing stage, which is the final stage, taking place post part manufacturing. It includes the following processes: #*Removing the supports #*Refining the surface for obtaining the desired surface quality  Speed up  Additive manufacturing technologies usually imply a trade off between the printing speed and quality. Improvements in speed of the entire 3D printing process can be grouped in the following two categories.  Software improvements  Comparison of the FFF/FDM based printer's average printing time according to the build orientation of a cup. Since the actual printing process is directly influenced by how the model is sliced, oriented, and filled, optimizing them results in shorter print time. Optimal Orientation. Changing the orientation of a part can be done through either the STL file or on the CAD model. Determining the optimal part orientation is a common software solution for all additive manufacturing processes. This can lead to a significant improvement in many key factors that affect the total print time. The following factors heavily depend on part orientation: *The height of the part in the build direction. Build speed is slower for z-direction than x-y directions. By minimizing height, the number of layers will be decreased. Hence, both manufacturing and idle time decrease. *A total volume of support material and total contact area of the part with the support structure. The less support material used, the faster the build time and finishing time for removing supports. By minimizing the support volume, less material is deposited so, in general, manufacturing time decreases. This factor influences processes that use external support structures, such as SLA, FDM. *The quality of the total surface area. The orientation of a part determines which faces are subjected to the staircase effect -- an artifact of layering. By maximizing the surface quality, the required time to finish the surface to the desired tolerance decreases. 290x290px Adaptive Slicing. Error caused by the staircase effect can be measured using several metrics, all of which refer to the difference between model surface and actual printed surface. By adaptively computing the height distribution of layers, this error can be minimized: The quality of surface increases while post-processing time decreases. The benefits of adaptive slicing depend on the proportion of the surface-to-volume ratio of the part. Efficient computation of adaptive layers is possible by analyzing the model surface over the full layer height. Several implementations are available as an open source software.  Hardware improvements  Increasing the speed of printing through hardware can take the following forms, many of which are used by leading 3D printing companies. * Modified printheads: using different types of printheads for different printing processes. For instance, having an additional knifed feeder to prevent filament slipping. * Temperature: including an additional laser to melt the filament before going to the extruder. This prevents unnecessary printhead heating, thereby lowering printhead cooling time. * Minimizing adhesion force within the dead layer of Digital Light Projector based technologies. * Gel Dispensing Printing technology, which extrudes a gel material immediately hardened by UV-LED curing * Adding more printheads which collaborative using path planning to increase the printing speed. *Using special types of materials for specific manufacturing technologies.  Challenges  Depending on the technology used, there are some challenges that could limit the speed of the 3D printing: *Shape optimization. Since a product's interior can be filled using many different structures, design optimization through additive manufacturing is necessary. Finding the best way to fill in a product interior given certain constraints is a challenging problem. * Part orientation. Theoretically, there are infinitely many orientations. Depending on the purpose of the part, there may not be an optimal orientation when trying to optimize multiple criteria at once. * Slicing. Two main challenges with the slicing are the staircase effect and the containment problem. *Tool path planning. Since the speed of the printing tool can change the size of the layer, the physical and mechanical properties of the process need to be taken into account during the tool path planning. *Post-processing. The removed support material can still leave burrs or residue that can be polished by using other methods like sanding the part by hand, bead blasting, traditional machining, or acetone finishing. *Hardware and maintenance issues. After a part is printed, typical cleanup procedures required to ensure that operations continue with the same quality. Depending on the used material's type, parameters of lasers need to be tuned for avoiding the unnecessary over-curing or sintering. *Printing methodologies. Each printing methods has its own pros and cons. For example, DLP-based methods have an advantage of manufacturing the entire layer at once. However, DLP idle time is longer due to the adhesion force. SLA based method uses two or more lasers that intersect at specific points to cure the material -- point by point curing -- however, it presents challenges in both planning and implementation. Layer-less methods have more complicated path planning.  Research  1\\\\. Homogeneous material 2. The structured ultrasound field is applied 3. UV light is applied to cure the resulting shape of the previous step  Acoustic fabrication  Interesting features of sound waves have encouraged scientists to use it in additive manufacturing. Sound waves can form pressure fields that shape the material in the desired form in a contact- free setup. The fact that it can be applied over a large area at the same time makes it a good candidate for rapid fabrication. The process starts by designing an acoustic hologram. An acoustic hologram is a mask that will direct the sound field to form the desired pattern. It can be fabricated in an additive fabrication combined with etching and nanoimprint methods. The process follows by placing silicone rubber particles in a liquid medium with photo-initiator agents. Then the acoustic mask is used to generate the desired pressure sound field to put the particle in the correct order. The next step is applying the UV light to solidify the final product. Rapid Continuous additive manufacturing by inhibition patterning  Improved SLA processes  The speed of SLA processes is limited by: * Adhesion of cured material to the projection window * Disturbance of the resin surface Rapid continuous additive manufacturing by inhibition patterning Due to the mentioned effects, the printing speed with SLA methods is limited to a few millimeters to several centimeters per hour. To address this problem a system of two light sources is used, one for polymerization and one for inhibiting the polymerization to avoid adhesion and as a result print faster. This method allows us to speed up the process up to 200 cm/hr. Moreover, by controlling the intensity of each pixel in the setup topographical patterning can be created in a single exposure with no stage translation. Rapid 3D printing, mobile liquid interfaceA mixture of photo initiators and photo inhibitors is used in the setup. The absorbance spectra of two material is orthogonal this allows to control the process with the two orthogonal light sources. As the material is generated layer by layer the tray is gradually lifted and the photo inhibitors will not allow adhesion near the window.275x275px Rapid, large-volume, thermally controlled 3D printing, using a mobile liquid interface Another way to address the adhesion problem is to create a dead layer which prohibits the curing process. One method to create this dead layer is to use fluorinated oil flow. This liquid is omniphobic which means that it repels all the materials and will not stick to anything. The reason to use a flow instead of a static layer is to create a larger force against the adhesion force and also help with the cooling of the cured layer (curing generates heat).  Fast 3D printing by integrating construction kit building blocks  Dividing an Object into smaller blocks (e.g. Lego parts) before print, can lead to 2.44x increase in speed over conventional printing method. Moreover, when the object needs to be iterated to find the optimal design it is not efficient to reprint the whole object over and over again: One solution is to print the main constant structure only once and reprint only the small changing parts with high resolution. These smaller parts are mounted onto the main structure.

He served in all of Uganda's post independence armies, from 1964 until 2002. He was the commander of the Uganda Army Air Force during the 1970s. He also served as the Chief of Army Staff after Tito Okello overthrew Milton Obote's second administration in 1985. Background and education Zeddy Maruru was born on 3 February 1942, in Rushenyi Village, in present-day Ntungamo District. He attended Rwamanyonyi Boys School and Kitunga Primary School. He then transferred to Mbarara High School, before completing his O-Level studies at Ntare School 1960. He then joined Royal Technical College, in Nairobi. He studied pre-engineering courses for two years. He then dropped out of the technical school, after attaining his A-Level Certificate. He returned to Uganda to help his father raise funds to educate his younger siblings. In 1964, Maruru joined the Uganda Army. He and about 30 others were sent to Jinja for basic military training for three months. He was then sent to Czechoslovakia for pilot training, spending there two and one half years. While there, he trained both as a pilot and as a pilot instructor. From October 1970 until December 1971, he attended a Staff College course at the RAF Staff College, Bracknell, in the United Kingdom. While there, he was promoted to the rank of Captain, by Idi Amin who visited the college in 1971. Career Maruru returned to Uganda in 1967 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He was posted to Gulu Air Force Base, which was opened after his cohort returned from Czechoslovakia. At Gulu, he completed his training and recruited young men whom he and his classmates trained. In 1968, he was promoted to First Lieutenant. In 1973, at the rank of Major, Maruru volunteered to accompany President Amin on a trip to Iraq. At the end of that trip, Maruru was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. He also became quartermaster general of the air force. In 1974, he was made acting commander of the Uganda Army Air Force. In December 1975, Maruru was relieved of his duties as air force Commander. Exile He was dismissed from the Uganda Army in 1975. He went into exile, first to Nairobi, Kenya, then Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. When the Uganda–Tanzania War broke out in 1979, Maruru was one of the exiles who organised a pro-Tanzanian militia of Ugandan rebels. Maruru became one of the top commanders of the Kikosi Maalum, a contingent of troops commanded by Tito Okello and Oyite Ojok. Return to Uganda In 1979 during the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) Government, Maruru became a member of the National Consultative Council, which was the Parliament at that time. After the fall of President Godfrey Binaisa in 1980, the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) appointed Maruru to the Military Commission to run the affairs of the country. General elections were held in Uganda in 1980 and Maruru was appointed Brigade Commander in Northern Uganda based at Gulu. He was later transferred to command the Brigade in Western Uganda. He was appointed as Chief of Operations and Training in the UNLA. When Tito Okello and Bazilio Olara Okello overthrew Obote in 1985, Maruru was promoted to the rank of Brigadier and shortly after to Major General. He was then appointed UNLA Chief of Staff. When the National Resistance Army (NRA) rebels overran Kampala in January 1986, Maruru was among the high-ranking officers who surrendered there. He personally met NRA leader Yoweri Museveni at Kampala's Republic House, telling him that he was content to be treated as prisoner of war or be released. To his surprise, Museveni offered him a job in the NRA. Maruru accepted, and went on to serve in Uganda's new national army.  Later life  In 1990, he was appointed as General Manager of Uganda Air Cargo. Maruru retired in 2002. In his later life Maruru suffered from hypertension. He died on 11 January 2014 at Mulago Hospital in Kampala.

It is formed of a stone base and shaft on a brick plinth; the cross itself is missing, but the shaft is topped with a ‘cornice-like’ stone. The cross is a Grade I listed building (List Entry Number 1353268). A charter for a market at Alfriston was granted in 1406; the market cross was probably erected at about that time. Little, if anything, of the original cross remains. The cross was altered in the 19th century; twice repaired after being damaged in the early 20th century; and rebuilt in 1955-56, after it was smashed when a lorry reversed into it. Notwithstanding the rebuilding, the cross is a rare feature within Sussex. History A market at Alfriston, then part of the Duchy of Lancaster, was granted by a charter dated 24 May 1406. The market was to be held every Tuesday. The charter was granted by King Henry IV to the king and his heirs as Dukes of Lancaster, to be held at the ‘at the king’s town’. The charter also granted two fairs, to be held on the vigil and feast of Andrew the Apostle (30 November) and the vigil and feast of Philip and James (1 May) (the ‘vigil’ was the day before the saint’s feast day). It is likely the market cross was erected around the time the charter was granted. Replacement in the 19th and 20th centuries means that only the socket stone and the lowest stone of the shaft may be medieval survivals. The official listing of the market cross by Historic England states ‘the cornice-like stone at the top was added in 1833, when the old steps were removed’. However, other accounts suggest the steps were removed, and the current brick base built, in the 1870s, at the time St Andrew's Church was being restored. Some sources suggest the ‘cornice-like stone at the top’ is a representation of a ‘shepherd’s crown’, a flint fossil of a sea urchin, carried by downland shepherds for good luck. In the First World War, and again in the Second World War, the cross was considerably damaged when drunken Canadian soldiers climbed it. A metal core was inserted in the stone shaft when it was repaired. A photograph from before 1900 shows the stone shaft intact; later post-war photographs show the rather crude repairs to the shaft where it had been broken. The market cross was first listed on the National Heritage List for England on 13 October 1952. Destruction and restoration of the market cross, 1955-56 On Tuesday, 15 November 1955 a three-ton lorry reversed into the market cross and smashed it to pieces. Alfriston Parish Council decided to restore the cross once again, and the work was undertaken by a local building firm, H. Wilson. Initially there was some difficulty in matching the sandstone from which the cross was built, which was thought to have come ‘from the sea shore at Eastbourne’. However, Colonel R. V. Gwynne, the chairman of Eastbourne magistrates, realised that the stonework of an ancient tithe barn which stood on his land in the grounds of Wilmington Priory was an almost exact match both in colouring and texture. He therefore gave several blocks of the sandstone from the barn for the restoration. (A report about the restoration of the cross in the Eastbourne Gazette of Wednesday 7 December 1955 noted that ‘When the Sussex Archaeological Trust took over the maintenance of Wilmington Priory it considered the ancient [tithe] barn to be too advanced in decay to be taken over, and some time ago Colonel Gwynne had the colossal oak beams dismantled and placed in store'.) To minimise the potential damage from future accidents, a solid concrete base was constructed within the rebuilt brick plinth, and the metal core of the shaft, inserted when it was last repaired, was retained. The restoration was complete by August 1956, having been delayed by bad weather. The ‘County Diary’ feature in the Sussex Agricultural Express of Friday 10 August 1956 noted that ‘The new shaft looks thicker than the original because the old one was worn by the years. The builders had the guide of the base and top to shape the shaft to, and anyone who did not know of the disaster would merely think it had been restored’. The difference in the thickness of the shaft can be seen when comparing photographs of the market cross from before and after the accident in 1955. The Ship of Theseus paradox In the Sussex Extensive Urban Survey (EUS) Historic Character Assessment Report for Alfriston (March 2008), the author, Roland Harris, remarked ‘The market cross at Alfriston may be a late medieval survival, although with a strong hint of the ship of Theseus paradox’; however, he recognised that ‘Notwithstanding the rebuilding, the cross is a rare feature … within Sussex’. In the metaphysics of identity, the Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.

Amongst the many roles she created in their world premieres was the title role of Spontini's Olimpie. Born in Paris and trained at the Conservatoire de Paris, she was also a principal singer of the Chapelle royale until 1830. She was married to Albert, danseur noble of the Paris Opéra. Life and career Albert was born Louise-Marguerite-Augustine Himm in Paris. She entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1803 where she was a pupil of Charles-Henri Plantade. The following year she received the conservatory's first prize in singing and later studied with the castrato singer Girolamo Crescentini. She first appeared at the Paris Opéra in 1803 at the age of 12 as L'Amour (Cupid) in Cherubini's Anacréon. However, her official debut there came in 1806 when she sang Antigone in Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone. She went on to sing in the world premieres of multiple operas and also appeared in the leading soprano roles of many others, including Julia in La Vestale, Amazily in Fernand Cortez, and Eurydice in Orphée et Eurydice. After her marriage in 1811 to the dancer Albert, she performed under the name Augustine Albert. The couple had two children, a son Alexander, and a daughter Elisa, both of whom became dancers of some note but never achieved the fame of their father. For many years Albert was also a principal singer in the Chapelle royale of Louis XVIII and later Charles X. She retired from the Paris Opéra in 1823 but continued as a singer of the Chapelle royale until 1830 when she retired to Versailles. The date of her death is unknown, but she was still alive in 1846 according to an article on artists receiving pensions from the Paris Opéra in L'Album de Sainte-Cécile. Roles created Albert as Philis in Le Rossignol Roles created by Albert in their world premieres include: *L'Amour in Anacréon (opéra-ballet in 2 acts) composed by Luigi Cherubini, libretto by C.R.

Professional career Basheel made her professional debut on 5 April 2015, suffering a four round points decision loss to Ruth Chisale at the Robins Park Hall in Blantyre, Malawi. After losing her first five fights, one by stoppage; a fourth-round technical knockout (TKO) to Lolita Muzeya in November 2015, she defeated Monalisa Sibanda by first-round TKO to score her first professional win. Basheel then won her next five fights, all by stoppage, before facing Consolata Musanga for the inaugural ABU female super-featherweight title on 2 December 2017 at the Carnivore Grounds in Nairobi, Kenya, winning via ninth-round TKO. For her next fight Basheel moved up in weight to face Sam Smith on 15 June 2018 at the York Hall, London, for the inaugural Commonwealth female lightweight title. Basheel became the first female to capture a Commonwealth title with a first-round TKO. Basheel dropped her opponent less than 20 seconds after the opening bell; stunning Smith with a solid left hook and following up with two right hands to score the knockdown. Smith rose to her feet to beat the referee's count of ten, only to be on the receiving end of several heavy blows. The end came 1 minute and 10 seconds into the round after a solid jab sent Smith stumbling backwards into the ropes, causing referee Marcus McDonnell to wave the fight off. A year later, Basheel challenged undefeated WBC Silver and former IBO female lightweight champion Chantelle Cameron on 20 July 2019 at the Brentwood Centre in Brentwood, Essex. The fight was a WBC final eliminator with the winner earning a mandatory shot at the WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO champion Katie Taylor for the undisputed lightweight title.

The show will take place on December 1, 2019 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico. For the PALL 1st Anniversary show Demonio Infernal and Fresero Jr. will both risk their hair on the outcome of the main event match. The show will also include a match for the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. The fifth match of the night is scheduled to be a rematch between Internacional Pantera and the wrestler who won his mask in 2006, Misterioso Jr. Production Background Several minor Mexican independent circuit professional wrestling promotions joined together late 2018 to form an overall sanctioning body called Promotores Asociados de Lucha Libre (\\"Promotional Association of Professional Wrestling\\"; PALL) to act as a unifying organization for wrestling promotions International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), Lucha Memes, Lucha Libre Boom, Promociones NOBA, Pleu Sports, MDA Lucha Libre, Generación XXI, GCC and Tortas Súper Astro. The various companies would collaborate on events, coordinate to make sure they were not holding shows on the same day. For the wrestlers PALL had a fund to help support wrestlers who were injured during a PALL sanctioned show as well as give them support in promoting them across Mexico. The first co-promoted show under the PALL banner took place on August 31, 2018 in Arena Naucalpan, in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, owned by the IWRG. Storylines The show will feature sevenprofessional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The seeds for the shows main event was sown on September 16, 2019, when Fresero Jr. and his tag team partner Mr. Iguana defeated Demonio Infernal and Warrior Jr. after which Fresero Jr. made a challenge for Demonio Infernal's IWRG Rey del Ring Championship. Two weeks later Demonio Infernal successfully defended the championship against Fresero Jr. On the October 27 IWRG show Fresero Jr. helped El Hijo de Canis Lupus defend the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against Demonio Infernal by interfering in the match. Following the match Demonio Infernal made a Lucha de Apuestas, \\"hair vs hair\\" match challenge. Fresero Jr. defeated Demonio Infernal in a Super Libre, no disqualification match, on November 24, followed by accepting the Apuesta challenge. On March 24, 2019, Aramís and Imposible defeated Heddi Karaoui and Death Metal to win the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. The duo defended the championship twice in the subsequent months, defeating Capo del Norte and Capo del Sur on April 10, and then El Hijo de Canis Lupus and Dragón Bane On April 28. When the full show for the PALL 1st Anniversary show was announced, IWRG revealed that Aramís and Imposible were no longer champions, instead six tag teams would wye for the championship: Los Traumas ( Trauma I and Trauma II), Los Alas (Alas de Oro and Alas de Plata), Los Fulgors (Fulgor I and II), Ave Rex and Toxin and US representatives Bryce Benjamin and Marshe Rockett, better known as Da Soul Touchaz. In 2006 Internacional Pantera, then known simply as \\"El Pantera\\" lost a steel cage match to Misterioso Jr., which also included El Sagrado, Volador Jr., Nitro, Neutron, Mascara Purpura, Averno, Mephisto, El Felino, Sangre Azteca, La Máscara. As a result of the Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" stipulation Pantera was forced to unmask. After unmasking he revealed his real name, Francisco Javier Pozas, as part of the Lucha Libre tradition. Pantera later left CMLL and began to wear his mask again, claiming that CMLL had not paid for the mask loss, thus he did not honor the stipulation of the match and resumed wrestling with the mask on.

The event commemorated the sport of lucha libre becoming allowed in the State of Mexico, with the first lucha libre show held in the state taking place in December 1962. Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year. The event, also billed as La Revolución 57, saw L.A. Park defeat Blue Demon Jr. in the main event of the night. In the semi-main event, lucha libre veteran El Canek defeated Rayo de Jalisco Jr., and Máscara Sagrada. In the fifth match of the night, the sons of L.A. Park (El Hijo de L.A. Park and L.A. Park Jr.) defeated the fraternal teams of Las Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II) and El Hijo de Canis Lupus/Dragón Bane. The show featured four additional matches. Production Background The history of lucha libre, or professional wrestling in Mexico goes all the way back to the early 1900s where individual promoters would hold shows on a local basis in various Mexican states. In 1933 Salvador Lutteroth created Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; Spanish for \\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\") and in subsequent years took EMLL to a national level. In the 1930s and 1940s various Mexican starts to create lucha libre commissions, often as an extension of the existing Boxing commissions, responsible for overview of lucha libre in each state, licensing wrestlers and ensuring the rules are being enforced. In the State of Mexico lucha libre was not officially sanctioned in late 1962, with the first sanctioned lucha libre show in the State of Mexico being held in December of that year. The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has on occasion held a major show in December to commemorate the \\"birth\\" of Lucha Libre in their home state. It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2019 show will be the 57th anniversary and will be held on December XX, 2019 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds all of their major lucha libre shows. Storylines The 57th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines.

It covers two distinct geological features of the North Atlantic Ocean: the Barra Fan and the Hebrides Terrace Seamount. Barra Fan The Barra Fan is a geological protected feature of the North Atlantic Ocean to the west of the Scottish island of Barra. It was formed by a series of submarine landslides that affected an area of subsea sediments. The fan lies to the east of the Hebrides Terrace Seamount, in a region known as the Hebridean Slope, where the seabed drops from the continental shelf, at a depth of c. 150 m below sea level, down to Rockall Trough (c. 2300 m below sea level). The topography of the seabed in the Barra Fan was modified by the action of icebergs grounding on the seabed during the ice ages, and has also been affected by the action of oceanic currents. Hebrides Terrace Seamount The seamount of the Hebrides Terrace is thought to represent the remnant of an ancient volcano that rises to a height of almost 1 km above the surrounding seabed. It lies to the west of the Barra Fan, and supports a diverse range of marine life, including cold-water corals and deep sea sponges. The effect the seamount has on underwater currents is thought to ensure a good supply of food for many species of fish in the area, and the seamount is particularly associated with the orange roughy, a large long-living deep-sea fish. Several species of whale and shark also visit the area. The seamount is the location of a positive gravity anomaly that is thought to indicate the presence of an igneous body of rock some 17 km thick.

It was manufactured until the 1960s and over 100,000 units were produced, making it one of the most common Leica wide-angle lenses ever made.

The fight was televised live on BoxNation, with Harris winning via unanimous decision (UD) over twelve rounds. The judges' scorecards read 117–112, 116–113 and 115–114. Following three more wins, one by knockout (KO), he made the first defence of his Commonwealth title against Ross Murray on 3 November 2018 at the York Hall. Harris successfully retained his title with a third-round technical knockout (TKO). After a six round PTS win over Brett Fidoe in March 2019, he next fought former world title challenger Angel Moreno on 1 June at the Vale Sports Arena in Cardiff, with the vacant European flyweight title on the line. All three judges scored the bout in favour of Harris, with the scorecards reading 120–108, 119–109 and 117–111, awarding Harris the European title via UD. Four months later, he faced two-time Olympic bronze medalist and former world title challenger Paddy Barnes on 11 October at the Ulster Hall, Belfast, for the vacant IBF Inter-Continental flyweight title. The fight was streamed live on ESPN+ in the United States and globally through YouTube channel iFL TV, with Harris capturing his third professional title with a fourth-round KO. Harris, being the bigger of the two, used the height and reach difference to his advantage, boxing at range with sharp jabs and straight right hands. In the final 60 seconds of round one, Harris landed a straight right hand to stun Barnes and send the former three-time Olympian reeling into the ropes. After a follow up attack by Harris, Barnes fired back with a rapid ten punch combination, all of which were taken on the gloves by Harris. Round two saw much of the same, Harris staying at range, continuing to land jabs and straight right hands to the head with Barnes having little success. The third was an action packed round. With Harris electing to fight at close quarters, Barnes began finding the target with hooks to the head and body, opening a cut above Harris' right eye. In the final minute of the round, Harris landed a left hook to the body that dropped Barnes to undo the Irishman's previous success. He raised to his feet before the referee's count of ten to see out the remainder of the round. The end came in the round four. With Harris going back to fighting at range, Barnes took punishment throughout, finally being dropped with a left hook to the midsection. Unable to beat the count of ten, the fight was stopped with 48 seconds remaining.

As all Monogenea, species of Microcotylidae are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. Members of the genus Diplasiocotyle are characterised by a conspicuous haptor, a midventral genital atrium armed with small hooks.

Delgado and starring Cantinflas, Ana Bertha Lepe and Valeria Pani. The film concludes the loose trilogy around the character of the Patrolman 777, who first appeared in The Unknown Policeman (1941) and reappeared in The Atomic Fireman (1952), although the only connection between the three films is that Cantinflas's character is a policeman who uses the callsign 777. Plot Sergeant Diógenes Bravo (Cantinflas) is the Patrolman 777, a member of the Mexico City police. He has a high sense of honesty, but due to his very particular way of solving problems, he is regularly berated by his superior, Major Malagón (Wolf Ruvinskis). While on duty, Bravo meets a group of prostitutes, among them Claudia Loza \\"La clarines\\" (Ana Bertha Lepe) and Guadalupe \\"La Pingüis\\" (Valeria Pani). Bravo and his partner on the force (Julio Alejandro Lobato) investigate a gang of drug traffickers led by \\"El Johnny\\" (Ramón Menéndez), who exploits the prostitutes. Many other stories take place through the course of the film, such as high-speed races in which wealthy young men participate in public roads and end in disgrace, and a robbery at a high society party. Once, while patrolling at night, Bravo stops to help a young man in a serenade, and in another case, he attends a case of domestic violence in which it is the wife (Ofelia Guilmáin) that beats her husband, and in which Bravo has to run away before the lady ends up beating him too; and in another case, Bravo ends up going through a delivery for the first time and in the absence of the ambulance he manages to get out the baby, and even an suicide attempt to in which he has to climb the ledge of a building to rescue the suicidal man (Fernando Luján). In the climax of the film, Bravo and his partner stop near the Tlalpan road a band from which they confiscate high-powered weapons, including grenades. Subsequently, \\"La Pingüis\\" provides information to Bravo about an illegal operation by El Johnny's gang. Bravo and his partner attend the scene, where they are received with gunshots, during which Bravo results injured. To prevent the escape of criminals, Bravo uses one of the seized grenades to blow up a truck full of drugs. Bravo is congratulated by his superiors and the film ends in a formal ceremony in which he is promoted to Lieutenant, with the police contingent activating the sirens of his vehicles as a sign of respect.

Pilcher questioned the idea of the film portraying a sympathetic policeman, noting that at the time, corruption within the Mexico City police reached new highs under chief of police Arturo \\"El Negro\\" Durazo, who was under indictment in the United States for drug trafficking, and accused Cantinflas of \\"pathetically selling out his beloved old gendarme character to the power elite.\\" Pilcher stated that \\"the irony was not lost on reviewers,\\" citing that reviewers at the time described the film as \\"a contribution to making the abominable and feared 'blues' [of the capital's police force] sympathetic.\\" With regards of Cantinflas's performance, Pilcher stated, \\"Having gone thick in the middle at the age of sixty-six, he fit poorly in a police uniform; drooping pants had become completely unthinkable. But advanced years did not stop him from carrying his duties of karate chopping drug pushers, rescuing fallen women, and lecturing hippies.\\"Pilcher, p. 202 Both Carlos Monsiváis in Los ídolos a nado and Joanne Hershfield and David R.

Similar to single material additive manufacturing it can be realised through methods such as FFF, SLA and Inkjet (material jetting) 3D printing. By expanding the design space to different materials, it establishes the possibilities of creating 3D printed objects of different color or with different material properties like elasticity or solubility. The first multi-material 3D printer Fab@Home became publicly available in 2006. The concept was quickly adopted by the industry followed by many consumer ready multi-material 3D printers.  Multi-material 3D printing Technologies   Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)  alt= alt= alt= Material Jetting 3D Printing Schematic of a Binder Jetting 3D Printer The Prusa3d Multi-Material Upgrade Fused Filament Fabrication (also known as Fused Deposition Modeling - FDM) describes the process of continuously extruding a line of thermoplastic material to form a three dimensional model. The FFF process supports a variety of materials reaching from bio degradable ones like PLA to PETG, ABS and engineering grade materials like PEEK. This technology additionally allows for the use of flexible materials like TPU. Two possible solutions to realise a multi-material FFF 3D printer are:  Single Nozzle Design  The single nozzle design combines the different materials before or in the melting zone of the print head such that the materials are extruded through the same nozzle. For example: The different filaments can be cut and rejoined to a single strand of a mixed filament before being fed into the melting chamber. Such a technique is implemented in the Mosaic Palette. Another example is the multi-material upgrade by Prusa3d, which is mounted on top of a single material printer to add multi material capabilities. It uses a bowden style extrusion system with an additional axis to cut and select the material. To prevent impurities inside of the object a combined melting chamber has to be cleared from the previous material before a new one can be used. Depending on the implementation, the amount of waste material produced during the printing process may be significant. In some implementations, the previous material may be used as in-fill to prevent waste, or to simultaneously print a different object in which color does not matter.  Multi-Nozzle Design  A printer with two print heads, that share 2 degrees of freedom. The multi-nozzle design features a separate nozzle for each material. The nozzle can either be mounted on the same print head or on independent print heads. For this approach to work the different nozzles have to be calibrated to the exact same height relative to the print surface to circumvent the interference of an inactive nozzle with the printed object. Such a design reduces the amount of waste material during the printing process significantly compared to a single nozzle design which does not use the previous material as in-fill or to print another object.  Stereolithography (SLA)  Stereolithography is the process of solidifying a photopolymer with a laser layer by layer to form a three dimensional object. To realize multi- material prints with this technology, one can use multiple reservoirs for different photopolymers. A major problem with this approach is the removal of the not yet polymerised material as the print may contain cavities filled with the old material, which should be emptied before the next material can be used. The photopolymer resins used for SLA can have highly different physical properties, generally being more brittle and having a lower heat deflection temperature. The SLA standard resins come in different colours and opacities. Besides the engineering grade materials like the ABS-like or PP-like resin, there exist bio-compatible ones used for medical applications and flexible resins.  Material Jetting  alt= The process of material jetting, often also called Inkjet 3D printing, is similar to the 2D Inkjet printing procedure. The print head consists of multiple small nozzles which jet droplets of photopolymers on demand. Each nozzle can extrude a different material, which allows for the creation of multi-material parts. The droplets of material are then immediately cured using a UV light source mounted to the print head. In contrast to the FFF printing process, a layer is not formed by moving the print head along a pre-calculated path, but by scanning the layer line by line. The Statasys J750, for example, allows for full colour prints. The materials supported by the material jetting printing process are similar to the ones of the SLA process and hence share similar properties. Additionally there have been advances in the field of material jetting metals by suspending nano metal particles in a fluid. After the removal of the support material the printed object has to be sintered to create a final metal part.  Binder Jetting  A binder jetting 3D printer uses particles of a fine-grained powder, which are fused together using a binder, to form a three- dimensional object. In principle, it consists out of two separate chambers: One functions as a reservoir for the powdered material, the other one as the printing chamber. To fabricate a layer of an object a blade pushes the material out of the reservoir and spreads it over the printing surface to create a thin layer of powder. A print head similar to the one found in a 2D inkjet printer then applies the binder to the layer to solidify and bind it to the previous one. Although binder jetting does not allow for multi-material support, there exist printers, which feature a second print head to apply pigment to the layer after the binder to allow for full color prints.  Workflow   Designing  Designing a three dimensional object is the first step in the workflow of 3D printing. This design process can be supported by software. Such CAD software is capable of creating, managing and manipulating different 3D geometric figures while giving the user feedback through a graphical interface. Most CAD programs already support the annotation of a geometric figure with a material. The combination of different geometries then forms a single multiple material object. However, not all file formats support the annotation of materials together with the geometry of the object.  Slicing  Slicing is the process of splitting a 3D model into layers to transform them into a sequence of G-Code instructions. These instructions can be processed by a 3D printer to manufacture the corresponding model in either a bottom-up, top-down or even left to right manner. Before generating the instructions, support structures can be added to connect overhanging sections of the model to either the printing surface or other parts of the model. The support structures have to be removed in a post processing step after the print has finished. The slicing process for multi- material prints differs depending on the hardware used. For FFF based machines, instructions for changing the material have to be added. This comes with multiple computational challenges such as handling two print heads at the same time without them interfering with each other or clearing the melting chamber from the previous material. For SLA based multi-material prints the slicing software has to handle the additional degrees of freedom arising from the possibility of moving the print from one resin tray to the next one. The slicing procedure for material jetting printers involves the generation of multiple bitmap images representing the voxels of the object.  Post- Processing  3D printed objects may need to be post processed before they can be used as a prototype or a finished product. Such post-processing steps may including sanding the surface of the object to make it smoother or painting it to match the colours of the design. Depending on the printing method and the objects geometry, support structures may have to be removed. The use of multi-material 3D printing reduces the amount of post processing needed for the same result, as colours can be printed directly. Furthermore, it is possible to use a water soluble material for printing the support structures, as their removal only involves placing the object into a water bath.  Applications   Food 3D Printing  The rising trend of food 3D printing supports the customisation of shape, colour, flavour, texture and nutrition of different meals. Multi-material 3D printing enables using multiple ingredients like peanut butter, jelly or dough in the printing process, which is essential for the creation of most foods.  Medical Applications  Multi-material 3D printing technology is often used in the production of 3D printed prosthetics. It enables the use of different materials like a soft TPU on the contact points with the body and a stiff carbon fibre material for the corpus of the prosthetics. The prosthetics can therefore be adjusted to suit the varying needs and desires of an individual. Another medical use case is the generation of artificial tissue structures. The research focuses on creating tissue, that mimics human tissue in terms of feel, elasticity and structure. Such artificial tissues can be used by surgeons to train and learn on realistic models, which is otherwise hard or expensive to achieve. Current research focuses on 3D printed drug delivery systems to efficiently deploy a medication or vaccine. Through the use of multi-material printing they create biocompatible structures that can interact with the human body on a cellular level.  Physical Properties  The capability of switching between different materials is essential for controlling the physical properties of a 3D printed object. Besides being able to manipulate the strength of an object through micro-structures, the user can switch between harder or softer materials in the printing process to affect the rigidity of the object. The use of materials of different colour or elasticity can affect the looks and the haptics of the resulting object. Additionally, it is possible to reduce the amount of post-processing needed by choosing a suitable material for the support structures or the outer hull of the part.  Rapid Prototyping  Multi-material 3D printing enables designers to rapidly manufacture and test their prototypes. The use of multiple materials in a single part enables the designer to create functional and visually appealing prototypes. An example of how 3D printing can be included in the design process is automotive design. There, it is necessary to quickly test and verify a prototype to get the design approved for production. The reduced post-processing steps induced by the multi-material 3D printing technology result in a shorter fabrication time. Additionally, multi-material 3D printing reduces the part count of the produced prototypes compared to traditional fabrication methods like milling or molding, because the assembly of multiple parts with different materials is no longer required.  File Formats  There exist multiple file formats to represent three dimensional objects which are suitable for 3D printing. Yet not all of them support the definition of different materials in the same file as the geometry. The table below lists the most common file formats and their capabilities: {  +An overview of 3D printing file formats !File Format !Mode of Operation !Multi-Material Support !Remarks - STL raw, unstructured triangulated surface No Multi-material support can be achieved by saving one STL mesh per material, which results in multiple files for the same 3D objects. - OBJ vertices, texture mapping, vertex normals and faces No Multi-material support can be easily achieved with the companion file format MTL. - 3MF vertices and triangles saved as XML Yes Backed by the 3MF Consortium as a new standard file format for 3D printing. - VRML vertices and endges, UV-mapped textures Yes Designed particular for the World Wide Web.

The name Wachtmeister is German for 'sergeant'. The family branched out in 1683, and was \\"introduced\\" at the Swedish House of Nobility in 1689, in a baronial and a comital main branch; Wachtmeister af Björkö no. 31 and Wachtmeister af Johannishus no. 25. The baronial branch was dissolved on the \\"sword side\\" (svärdssidan, literally \\"on the side of the sword\\" meaning without any male heirs) in Sweden on 11 July 1889, but survives in Germany, where the principal is the Prussian Count Axel-Dietrich Wachtmeister (born 1941). A branch of the Wachtmeister af Björkö was elevated on 17 January 1816 into a Prussian, comital dignity. History The Swedish noble families of Wachtmeister, which originated from Hans Wachtmeister, who from Livonia came to Sweden and was ennobled in 1578. His grandson Hans became a Friherre with Björkö (in Karelia) in 1651 and is the progenitor of the baronial family of Wachtmeister af Björkö. Two of his sons became counts, namely Hans in 1687, progenitor of the comital family of Wachtmeister af Johannishus, and Axel in 1693, progenitor of the comital family of Wachtmeister af Mälsåker (in Södermanland), which dissolved on the \\"sword side\\" (svärdssidan, literally \\"on the side of the sword\\") in 1708. The aforementioned Friherre (\\"Baron\\") Hans Wachtmeister's grandson Karl Adam received count's dignity in 1799. His nephew, Friherre Karl Axel Didrik (1780–1837), who left Swedish service in 1806 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and settled in Pomerania, became a Prussian count in 1816. Count Hans Wachtmeister af Johannishus' grandson's son, the Lord High Steward Carl Axel Wachtmeister, adopted, with the support of a royal letter on 5 April 1808, after his mother he took up the entailed estate of Trolleberg, the name Trolle-Wachtmeister. This name, along with the Trolle coat of arms in conjunction with that of the Wachtmeister coat of arms, must be borne by his descendant of the Wachtmeister family, who holds the mentioned entailed estate (the right of the entailed estate was transferred in 1830 from Trolleberg to Ljungby, later called Trolle-Ljungby).

Vandana finally realises that Nandakumar is an innocent man who has nothing do with that case, and she falls in love with him. Thereafter, Vandhana finds the culprit: the local church father (R. N. R. Manohar) who lives in a church near the resort of Nandakumar. The church father finds her in his room. He manages to tie her up, and he then confesses the murders. He tells her that he is not a real church father and he killed the victims for having an extramarital affair or premarital sex. In the meantime, Nandakumar is chased by the police, and he enters the church to hide from them. The police then frees Vandana, and she reveals that the fake church father is the killer; thus, the church father is arrested. Nandakumar and Vandana live happily ever after.
